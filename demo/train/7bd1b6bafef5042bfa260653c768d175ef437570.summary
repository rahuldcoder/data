-- @entity1 moved thursday to allow rotc programs to set up on campus , after years of restricting the @entity6 military 's access because of its " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
the @entity9 , @entity10 , school barred @entity12 programs from being based on its campus 40 years ago , at the height of the @entity15			2
for more than a decade , university leaders -- among them , former law school dean and current @entity6 @entity21 justice @entity20 -- have cited the military 's policy prohibiting gays and lesbians from serving openly as the chief rationale for continuing the ban			1
@entity1 president @entity28 cited the recent decision to overturn that policy as the genesis for the university 's new tact			1
she will sign an agreement friday with navy secretary @entity36 to re-establish a home for @entity12 on campus , the school announced in a press release			1
" our renewed relationship affirms the vital role that the members of our armed forces play in serving the nation and securing our freedoms , while also affirming inclusion and opportunity as powerful @entity6 ideals , " @entity28 said in the statement			0
the full , formal recognition will take effect once repeal of the so - called " do n't ask , do n't tell " law , which had made it against military policy for homosexuals to serve openly , is complete this summer , according to the release			1
@entity1 will appoint a director for the @entity62 program and take over direct financial responsibility for the cost of students to participate in the program			0
@entity67 voted to repeal the policy in december , setting off a three - part process			0
last month , for instance , all four branches of the @entity6 military began training required as part of the repeal			0
the university is setting up a committee , to be chaired by professor @entity78 , a @entity79 captain who served three tours in @entity81 , to look into a host of issues , including bringing other military branches back onto campus			0
@entity1 was one of the first six educational institutions , in 1926 , to host @entity62 programs , the @entity86 noted in a release			2
once the change goes into effect , active - duty @entity86 and @entity92 personnel will meet on campus with students participating in the rotc program			2
" ( @entity86 ) @entity12 's return to @entity1 is good for the university , good for the military , and good for the country , " said @entity36 , in a statement from the @entity86			1
" with exposure comes understanding , and through understanding comes strength			0
" @entity1 's own policy regarding @entity12 on campus was the subject of national attention eight months ago , when @entity20 -- who was then a nominee for the high court -- came under criticism by @entity113 senators who complained that she actively tried to block military recruiters from @entity115 when she was dean			1
@entity20 and the @entity116 strongly defended her actions , saying that while she opposed the military 's policy , @entity20 never kept recruiters off the university			2
four months after taking the job as @entity1 's dean , in october 2003 , @entity20 sent a campus - wide email to students saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus " causes me deep distress			1
i abhor the military 's discriminatory recruitment policy			0
" she called the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy " a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order			0
" @entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity86 secretary calls the move " good for the university , good for the military "
@entity1 's president and the @entity86 secretary will sign a deal to return @entity12 to campus
