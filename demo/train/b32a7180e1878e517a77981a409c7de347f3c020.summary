@entity0 -- a @entity3 star is facing a storm of controversy over the sex of his unborn child			1
@entity9 's @entity8 has launched an investigation into media reports that the actor @entity12 and his wife are expecting a boy through a surrogate mother			1
sex determination tests are banned in @entity9 , and elsewhere in @entity17 , due to a traditional preference for sons			1
dr @entity20 of the @entity21 told @entity1 that @entity9 's @entity8 had investigated the case at the association 's request			1
" we wanted to know how this had been leaked out because it 's confidential information that only a doctor and not even a patient knows , " said @entity20 , who is the association 's coordinator for the @entity26 that bans sex selection			0
" @entity33 should be taken against the doctors and the patients who are not following this law			2
the celebrities or the rich and famous can not get away with it			0
" @entity12 -- who has a 16 - year - old son and 13 - year - old daughter -- has not yet commented on the issue			0
@entity20 said that doctors proven to have divulged an unborn child 's sex could face three years in jail and the suspension of their medical license for five years , while parents could face up to five years in jail			1
@entity9 banned sex detection in 1996 as it attempted to prevent the abortions of girls but , according to @entity55 at the @entity56 in @entity57 , this measure has had little impact on the country 's skewed sex ratio			1
sex detection tests are also illegal in @entity62 , another country where sex ratios are strongly biased toward males , but the ban has done little to correct the country 's gender ratio , which in 2011 stood at 117 men for every 100 women			1
the global average is between 103 to 107 men per 100 women			0
" it 's not particularly effective because there are always unscrupulous doctors , " he said			0
" and ultrasound is a really important diagnostic technology so people go and get the ultrasound for other reasons and sometimes you ca n't help but notice the sex of the child			0
" @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 also have unbalanced gender ratios , @entity84 added			2
@entity84 said that , in @entity9 , the preference for sons was historically confined to upper castes but as its economy has grown and the technology for sex selection made more widely available , the middle class had adopted the practice			1
in @entity62 , the preference is magnified by the country 's one - child policy and campaigns to stress gender equality are undermined by provisions that allow families in rural areas to have a second child if the first is a girl			2
" rich people want to have a male heir to inherit the family fortune , while people in rural areas want strong manpower and farmers think boys can do more to the help the family , " @entity110 , an expert in family planning from the @entity112 told the @entity113 in march			0
@entity84 said that banning abortion for sex selection is just one small part of the measures needed to change attitudes , with improvements needed in women 's rights to property ownership and better pension provision to reduce parents ' reliance on their children along with reform to dowries and dowry like systems			0
through legal reforms and a " love your daughter " public awareness campaign that highlighted the dangers of skewed sex ratios , @entity90 managed to reduce its sex ratio at birth from 116 men per 100 women to 107 by 2007 .			2
