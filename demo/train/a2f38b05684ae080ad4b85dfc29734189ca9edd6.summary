the @entity1 church has excommunicated a popular podcaster , saying his public dissents from the religion 's core beliefs have led others away from the church			1
@entity10 , founder of the podcast " @entity12 , " describes himself as an " unorthodox " @entity1 whose church roots reach back five generations			1
under tuesday 's penalty , however , @entity10 may not participate in church sacraments for at least one year			2
he has the right to appeal the decision			0
@entity10 is the second @entity1 to be excommunicated in the past year , following @entity19 , who was kicked out last june for pushing the church to admit women to its all - male priesthood			1
tuesday 's excommunication was announced in a letter to @entity10 from @entity25 , the stake president , or local church leader , in @entity28 , @entity29			2
@entity25 said that @entity10 was not excommunicated for criticizing the church , which he has openly admitted to , but for denying core @entity1 doctrines			1
the church has concluded that @entity10 's views on the following amount to apostasy : -- questioning the nature of @entity37 and divinity of @entity39 ; -- calling the @entity40 and @entity41 , two central texts , fraudulent ; -- teaching that the @entity43 , the @entity1 church 's official name , is not the " true church with power and authority from @entity37			1
" " you have spread these teachings widely via the internet to hundreds of people in the past and have shared with me , in previous correspondence , that you will continue to do so , " @entity25 wrote to @entity10 in a letter dated february 9			0
@entity10 has said that he suspects his support for female ordination and same - sex marriage , both of which @entity1 leaders oppose , was behind the effort to excommunicate him			1
in a statement on tuesday , @entity10 said : " my wife , @entity64 , and i are proud to stand in support of both free expression and gender / marriage equality within @entity68			0
while we are saddened that the @entity43 has chosen to excommunicate me for publicly supporting these values , we support the church 's right to make this decision			0
" @entity25 and @entity1 church spokesmen say that 's not true			2
" @entity43 disciplinary trials are usually kept private , but when the member has chosen to air their grievances in public , the @entity43 reserves the right to correct the public record , " @entity1 leaders said in a statement			0
" church discipline is not designed to be the end of the process , " church spokesmen said , " but the beginning of the road back to full fellowship			0
" @entity10 , who has run the @entity12 podcast and a related website for about a decade , told @entity90 that he stopped attending church last year .			0
