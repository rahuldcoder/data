-- over the years , i 've seen a good many meetings between @entity4 presidents and @entity6 prime ministers on big issues during critical moments			1
it usually takes a few days before we can begin to make sense of what occurred and what to expect			0
here 's a guide to interpret last week 's meeting between @entity16 and @entity17 on the @entity19 nuclear issue and how to read the next several months			1
best meeting yet but do n't be fooled unlike @entity22 , the @entity4 - @entity6 relationship really is too big to fail			1
driven by the marriage of value affinity , politics and national interest , it 's proved remarkably resilient over the years , particularly given the differences between a big nation and a tiny one			0
and this , the ninth meeting between their two leaders ( while in office ) , was among their best			0
that 's not saying much given the rocky relationship between the two			0
but for reasons of policy and politics , neither wants nor can afford a fight			0
the last thing @entity16 or @entity17 needed was to highlight differences on @entity19 , even while they do differ on the timing and need for a military strike			1
my sense is that the president still thinks the prime minister is something of a con man and the prime minister finds the president bloodless and lacking real emotional connection when it comes to appreciating @entity6 fears			2
there are plenty of rocky times ahead , particularly on the peace process between @entity6 and the @entity62 , a volatile issue ( now closed for the season ) but bound to become combustible again should @entity16 be re-elected in november			1
where you stand depends on where you sit the @entity19 issue highlights a fundamental truth about international politics and about @entity6 and @entity4 : when it comes to matters of national security and survival , size and geography can divide even the closest allies			1
@entity6 is a tiny nation that has been in conflict and at war since its inception			2
despite its regional superpower status and nuclear arsenal , it still sees itself living on the knife 's edge with little or no margin for error			2
for @entity6 , pre-emption and vigilance will always trump patience and passivity			1
( @entity91 : @entity6 's pre-emptive strikes in june 1967 ; against the @entity94 reactor in july 1981 ; and against an incipient @entity96 nuclear facility in september 2007			1
) the @entity4 is the most powerful nation on @entity97			0
it has nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west			0
it has enemies , but none that pose a potential existential threat			0
with rare exceptions ( @entity111 's administration ) , the @entity4 tends to be more deliberate and reactive in the projection of its military power because it has greater discretion			0
this gap can never be closed			0
the @entity6 are not poised to strike @entity19 anytime soon , but in threatening military action , they have used the urgency to place the nuclear issue at the top of the president 's agenda			1
we should n't be pushed by the @entity6 into war with @entity19 , but we can not trivialize their concerns either			1
they might act even if it means only a temporary delay in the @entity19 program and at tremendous cost to the @entity4			2
it is the way of the small power			0
@entity132 , not containment perhaps the most important development to emerge from the meeting last week was @entity16 's clear reset of the frame of reference within which @entity4 policy toward @entity19 will now play out			1
he gave very little away to the prime minister in terms of assurances , let alone guarantees , of @entity4 military action against @entity19			2
but he did highlight the new vocabulary : containment of @entity19 and its nuclear program wo n't do anymore			1
prevention of an @entity19 nuclear weapon is now the strategic objective			1
the president has alluded to preventing @entity19 from acquiring a weapon before , but these days , it takes on a much more activist cast			1
the @entity111 administration pushed containment and did n't seriously consider striking @entity19 's nuclear facilities			1
given the changing context , this president might well be called on to make good on his commitment			0
indeed , @entity16 is not prepared to acquiesce to @entity19 becoming a nuclear weapons state			1
living on borrowed time for the time being , the president and the prime minister agree nonmilitary means should be used to try to prevent @entity19 from pursuing its enrichment activities			2
@entity17 wanted a green light from the president should he deem it necessary to strike @entity19			1
he did n't get it			0
@entity16 wanted a red light from the prime minister that he would n't exercise a military option			2
the president did n't get that either			0
this was n't a meeting about making decisions or exchanging ironclad assurances that would commit either leader to a particular course of action			0
the reason for that is there 's no solution to the @entity19 nuclear issue in sight			1
neither leader will surrender his freedom of action : the prime minister to strike if necessary ; the president to avoid encouraging the @entity6 to do so or to commit the @entity4 to do it for the @entity6			2
that leaves a big gap and no clear path to a nonmilitary outcome			0
indeed , without a serious negotiation between @entity19 and the @entity198 ( the @entity4 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 ) , we 're drifting toward a military option , most likely by @entity6			1
the roadrunner / coyote game we will likely see more cat and mouse games , or in this case coyote and roadrunner games , perhaps with a return to the negotiations between @entity19 and the @entity198 on the issue of enrichment			2
@entity19 as roadrunner will continue to try to evade efforts to constrain their nuclear enrichment program			1
the @entity218 as coyote will try to stop them			0
in this case , the game of covert war and pressure , replete with sanctions , cyberattacks and assassinations , will likely continue			0
it 's clearly preferable to an overt one			0
@entity230 will try any number of ways to lay traps for roadrunner			0
more than likely , they will fail			0
only one country can prevent @entity19 from acquiring the capacity to arm itself with nuclear weapons , and that 's @entity19 , should it decide the costs of the nuclear effort are just too steep			1
four countries outside of the five permanent members of the @entity244 have nuclear weapons : @entity6 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248			1
@entity249 wanted them , and all got them			0
perhaps this time around , since we 're more focused and determined , we 'll have better luck with @entity19			2
but barring a change in the mullahacracy 's motivation to develop the capacity to produce a nuke , i would n't bet the mortgage on it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

@entity266 : last week 's meeting was the best between @entity16 , @entity17
still , he says the two men do not get along well , and their nations view world differently
he says @entity6 , always threatened , will always opt for preemption over patience
@entity264 : biggest change is @entity16 's focus on preventing @entity19 nuclear weapon
