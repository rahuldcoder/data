the @entity0 is a vast and seemingly limitless space , but it 's no match for @entity1			2
" @entity9 , " the @entity4 pop star 's enduring video phenomenon from 2012 , has surpassed 2,147,483,647 views on @entity6 , maxing out the site 's original view counter			1
" we never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32 - bit integer ( = 2,147,483,647 views ) , but that was before we met @entity1 , " wrote @entity10 , which owns @entity6 , in a blog post this week			1
" ' @entity9 ' has been viewed so many times we have to upgrade ! " for anyone who does n't have an advanced degree in computing , that basically means @entity6 's view counter was based on a 32 - bit integer , a unit of data in computer programming languages , and the number 2,147,483,647 is its maximum positive value			1
when programmers built @entity6 nine years ago , they probably never imagined that a video on the young platform -- back when several million views was considered a smash hit -- might be watched more than 2.1 billion times			2
as of late wednesday morning , " @entity9 " had breached the barrier , showing more than 2,152,512,000 views			0
so how is this possible ? @entity6 's software engineers saw the problem coming and recently updated to a 64 - bit view counter across the site , @entity10 spokesman @entity36 said			1
the view counter can now go up to 9 quintillion views ( 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 , to be exact ) , which should hold @entity1 for a while			1
" nothing actually broke , " @entity36 said			0
" there was never anything that actually went wrong			0
it 's just people having fun with the language			0
" still , it 's an impressive feat for @entity1 's trademark horse - riding dance video , which is almost 2Â½ years old			2
uploaded in july 2012 , " @entity9 " was the first clip to hit a billion views and is the most - watched video of all time			2
it was even the no. 5 most - played video on @entity6 this past summer , @entity36 said			0
" people still play this video an absurd number of times , " he said			0
to commemorate the occasion , @entity6 has added a new wrinkle : if you hover your cursor over the " @entity9 " view counter , the numbers spin backwards and forwards			1
in 2012 : @entity9 is new @entity6 king			0

" @entity9 " has maxed out @entity6 's original video - view counter
the clip , by @entity4 pop star @entity1 , has surpassed 2,147,483,647 views
@entity6 has been forced to upgrade its software in *response*
