@entity0 -- an @entity3 think tank with close links to the government has simulated what would happen in the @entity7 and internationally if @entity3 attacked @entity9 's nuclear facilities -- and concluded that reaction would be " in the direction of containment and restraint , " not the trigger for a larger war			1
the @entity17 - based @entity16 ( @entity16 ) says it held a " war game " several weeks ago -- when " it appeared that the fall of 2012 would be a critical period " -- simulating the initial ramifications of @entity3 airstrikes on @entity9 's nuclear facilities			1
" this sense of an imminent decision has since abated somewhat , but after the @entity28 and @entity3 elections , the question of an attack will undoubtedly resurface , " the think tank says in a report published this week in its online " @entity23			1
" for its war game , @entity16 used ex-israeli diplomats and military officials who played different roles , such as pretending to be the heads of state from @entity3 , the @entity28 , @entity35 and @entity9 , reacting to developments in the first 48 hours after such an attack			1
the war game was planned and enacted in september -- the same month that @entity3 prime minister @entity39 called on the @entity40 to stop @entity9 from developing nuclear weapons , holding up a picture of a spherical bomb and drawing a red line below the fuse			1
in the @entity16 ' scenario , @entity3 informs the @entity28 of its attack plan after its planes are in the air , but the @entity28 later " stood by @entity3 's side and did not expose its differences in opinion with @entity3 , " the think tank said in its summary of the simulation			1
while some analysts predict " the outbreak of @entity58 " after such an attack , the think tank said the september simulation aimed for a different approach : " containment and restraint			2
" " the intention was not to predict developments , rather to examine the significance and implications of one possible scenario , " the think tank said			0
" the players acted very rationally , demonstrating preventive policies and motivated by crucial interests alone			0
" the @entity3 @entity16 is based at @entity72 and describes itself on its website as an independent , nonpartisan academic institute but adds that it has " a strong association with the political and military establishment " in @entity3			2
the think tank 's analysis of its simulation does n't go into details about how @entity82 or @entity83 might respond as @entity28 president if @entity3 attacked @entity9 nuclear sites			1
@entity9 insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , but the program came up in last month 's final presidential debate between the two candidates			0
" as long as i 'm president of the @entity28 , @entity9 will not get a nuclear weapon			1
i made that clear when i came into office , " @entity82 said			0
@entity83 also said a nuclear - capable @entity9 was unacceptable , and said he would support tighter sanctions			0
" we need to increase pressure time and time again on @entity9 because anything other than a solution to this ... which stops this nuclear folly of theirs , is unacceptable to @entity28			2
and of course , a military action is the last resort			0
it is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent , " the @entity106 presidential candidate said			0
both candidates said the @entity28 would stand by @entity3 if that country is attacked			2
@entity1 's @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
