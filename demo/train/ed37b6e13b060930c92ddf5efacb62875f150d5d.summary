-- @entity1 says it 's no secret among his @entity4 friends : he 's a @entity5			2
but after he began posting news articles and political cartoons on his page that reflect his support for @entity5 presidential nominee @entity11 , his friend count began falling off			1
today , it 's down by several dozen			0
" one day , they are there			0
the next day , they just disappear , " said @entity1 , 53 , of @entity16 , @entity17			0
" most ( people ) do n't say anything to me about it			1
so i just say ' good riddance			0
' " it 's a story that 's been playing out on @entity4 and @entity24 with growing frequency among friends , family members , colleagues and acquaintances as an already contentious presidential campaign between @entity11 and president @entity31 enters its final , frenzied weeks			0
your close friends may share your political views , but that eccentric uncle , former co-worker or high school classmate may not			1
nearly one - fifth of people admit to blocking , unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings , according to a recent survey by the @entity44 's @entity43			1
the biggest gripes : the offending person posted too often about politics , disagreed with others ' updates , or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings			1
" in the real world , we navigate these issues all the time			0
we know not to bring up politics around certain friends or family members			0
we try to avoid people who are constantly looking for an argument or trying to sell us on their pet ideas , " said @entity58 , a @entity44 research associate			1
" since blocking , unfriending , hiding people is the closest social analogue to those real - world examples , it 's not necessarily surprising to see people taking these steps in the virtual space			1
" etiquette 101 : talking politics over @entity72 dinner muting the rhetoric it 's the hateful tone of the political conversation that is particularly disturbing to @entity76 , who has temporarily muted the @entity24 voices of roughly 150 people and blocked more than 400 others until after the november 6 election			1
more than one person has threatened to show up on @entity76 ' doorstep after he disagreed with them on @entity24			0
a few more have called him names			0
and at least one stepped across a political " red line , " endorsing a pundit that @entity76 finds offensive			1
" this is a pretty mercurial campaign on both sides			0
people on both sides tend to get heated pretty fast , " said @entity76 , 37 , of @entity92 , @entity93			1
as a result , he said , " there are way too many people on @entity24 who are a little scary			2
" @entity76 tweets under the pseudonym @ pettybooshwah			0
he does n't post pictures of himself , nor does he release details about his whereabouts			0
but he 's not shying away from political debate			1
" when you do n't follow people with the opposing viewpoint , @entity4 and @entity24 can become an echo chamber where everybody agrees , " @entity76 said			2
' @entity4 is not a democracy ' but that 's just fine with @entity112 , who took to @entity4 in recent weeks with a posting decrying political opposition on his page			2
simply put : for @entity112 , @entity4 is not a democracy			0
" this is not about platforms and political theory , from this point forward , to me , it 's about people simply picking a side , " @entity112 , an @entity31 supporter from @entity117 , said in a @entity4 post shortly after the @entity118 in late august			1
he warned off supporters of @entity11 from posting on his page , writing that he was " simply not having it			0
" since then , @entity112 's post has been repeatedly shared , finding a home on pages across @entity4 's political and not - so - political discussions			2
" this was amazing and i loved every second			0
i 'm glad he took the time to think and word this the way he did			0
i believe and agree with this 100 % , " wrote one admirer			2
@entity112 , who works as a touring comedian , has n't defriended anybody on his @entity4 page , though he believes he has probably lost a few social - media followers			1
tricky politics of political discourse in the workplace battling allegations the political divide on social media has become so wide that some people have been trying to silence one another			1
on @entity24 , conservatives have accusing liberals of trying to squelch their voices by falsely reporting them for spam , a violation of @entity24 rules that can result in the suspension of an account			1
liberal groups , meanwhile , have accused conservatives of using # block / report to shut them down			1
the battling allegations have led to competing blog posts that offer some of the same advice			1
@entity164 , a columnist for conservative site @entity166 , encouraged users to report suspected abusers , while @entity170 of left - leaning blog @entity171 said he would continue to tell his followers " to block and report " those who harass them			1
however it 's used , @entity24 has clearly become a key destination in the national discussion			0
@entity24 said a record 10.3 million tweets were sent during the first presidential debate last week , making it he most tweeted - about event in @entity182 politics			1
and for people sick of politics poisoning their feeds , there are @entity4 pages such as " @entity188			2
really , " where users can vent their frustrations			2
the page promises to be " open to all conservatives , liberals and moderates who are tired of the constant stream of political posts on @entity4			1
does n't mean that your views are not important -- just means that it is n't important to us to hear you blather on			0
@entity202 you do realize that you really are n't changing anyone 's opinion , right ? " repairing relationships it started out as friendly barbs on @entity4 , childhood friends sparring over differences in the presidential election			0

but you have to be aware of your audience , " @entity225 said			1
" you know these people would never say anything to your face			2
but it is sort of an unfortunate consequence of anonymity online			0
" for many people , the hardest part of the 2012 political debate may be restoring friendships that have been damaged			1
" i think that for friends , real friends , it will get better , " said @entity76 , who after the election plans to restore a number of @entity24 voices he has muted			0
