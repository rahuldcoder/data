-- the @entity1 is a small unprepossessing barrel - shaped clay cylinder inscribed in enigmatic - looking cuneiform , and yet is one of the most iconic objects in the unparalleled world collection housed at the @entity7			1
it is an object with many meanings and provides a link to a past that we all share and to a key moment in history that has shaped the world around us			1
as such it is an object of international significance and is about to start a tour of five major @entity20 museums , debuting at the @entity22 's @entity21 in @entity23 in march 2013			1
the tour is supported by the @entity25			0
the cylinder was buried under the walls of @entity28 around 539 b.c. after the @entity30 king @entity29 had captured the city			1
it describes how @entity29 was able to defeat the @entity34 king @entity33 with the aid of the @entity34 god @entity36 , who had run out of patience with @entity33 and his shortcomings			1
once he had entered the city , @entity29 did not burn it to the ground ( as usually happened with conquered cities at this period ) but he freed the population from forced labor obligations , sent back to various shrines statues of gods , and allowed the people who had been brought to @entity28 by the @entity34 kings to return to their homes			1
by this act , he was effectively allowing people to pursue unmolested their own religious practices			2
@entity53 : the history of our world in 18 minutes after it had been buried , the cylinder lay undisturbed for more than 2,400 years until it was dug up in 1879 by a @entity7 excavation led by @entity59			0
when the @entity34 cuneiform was translated , it was immediately realized that the cylinder had a very special significance			0
here was corroboration of one of the best - known stories in the @entity66 , the liberation by @entity29 of the @entity67 deported to @entity28 by @entity68 and their return to @entity71 to build the @entity72			1
although the @entity67 are not mentioned by name in the cylinder , they clearly must have been among the people allowed to return home at this time , with their temple goods			1
the cylinder also confirmed existing impressions of @entity29			1
in the @entity66 he is variously described as the @entity80 's @entity79 , no doubt largely because of his favorable treatment of the @entity67			0
not only did he allow them to return to @entity71 , but he also restituted the temple treasures seized by @entity68 and provided royal funds to pay for the rebuilding of the temple			0
@entity53 : revealing the lost codex of @entity89 in consequence , @entity29 has been favorably viewed by many @entity67 writers , not least in the context of the foundation of the state of @entity95			2
but it is not only in the @entity66 that @entity29 was revered			2
the @entity98 author @entity97 made him the subject of a political romance that seeks to establish the principles of good government , and his book " @entity104 " ( the @entity104 ) is even said to have been consulted by @entity105			0
in the 18th century " @entity104 " became required reading for all aspiring politicians , along with works such as " @entity109 " by @entity110 , and it certainly influenced the founding fathers of the @entity20			2
@entity113 is said to have owned two copies , one of which will be on view in the @entity23 exhibition			0
amidst so many of democracy 's icons and treasures , even before the discovery of the cylinder , therefore , @entity29 was a role model for many aspiring to govern			1
as @entity124 , @entity125 director of the @entity21 and the @entity126 , comments " @entity29 was the very image of a virtuous ruler , so it is apt that the first time it will be seen in the @entity20 is in @entity23 " just as @entity29 has long been a role model , the cylinder itself has now acquired iconic status for people around the world			1
it has even been described as the first declaration of human rights , and while this was never the intention of the document -- the modern concept of human rights scarcely existed in the ancient world -- it has come to embody the hopes and aspirations of many			0
@entity53 : ancient wonders captured in @entity148 it has continued to feature in political debate , being the symbol of the celebration of 2,500 years of @entity154 monarchy in 1971 , and also celebrated by the @entity155 of @entity154 , as evidenced by its popularity during the recent exhibition in @entity159			0
the cylinder may still have a role to play on the international stage today			0
it advocates -- or can be argued to advocate -- religious tolerance and acceptance of diversity , in terms that derive exclusively from @entity169 traditions			0
as such the principles it embodies should be central to debates about the future of the @entity169 and other regions			0
note : after the display at the @entity21 , the @entity1 will travel to the @entity177 in @entity178 , the @entity179 in @entity180 ; the @entity181 in @entity182 and will conclude at the @entity183 at the @entity184 in @entity185 in october			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2

a clay cylinder found under the walls of @entity28 is a key link to our past
@entity188 says the @entity1 describes rare act of tolerance
it tells the story of @entity30 @entity29 , who allowed conquered people to return home
