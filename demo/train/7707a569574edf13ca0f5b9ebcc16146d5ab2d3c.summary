@entity0 -- with his razor - sharp cheekbones and youthful appearance , @entity2 looks like he could be fresh out of design school			1
instead , the 28 - year - old is at the helm of one of the most venerable fashion houses in the world -- @entity11			1
since taking over in 2011 , the @entity13 - born prodigy has been credited with bringing a fresh , popular - culture aesthetic to the house , while staying true to its spirit and tradition			1
his richly embroidered , luxurious designs have earned him legions of fans , and his so - called " @entity26 " of supporters includes some of the most glamorous women in the world , from @entity24 to @entity25			1
@entity2 , who at 25 was the youngest creative director of a @entity0 label since the legendary @entity29 took the top job at @entity31 in the 1950s , has also been hailed as a champion of diversity , casting mixed - race and @entity36 models in his catwalk shows and advertising campaigns			1
the designer tells @entity1 about his love of " wonder women , " the meaning of luxury , and his friendship with his muse , @entity46			1
@entity1 : what is at the heart of the @entity49 ? @entity2 : @entity50 has always been a big designer like @entity31 or monsieur @entity29 , and when i had this opportunity to take ( on ) the house i just felt so flattered ... it was an honor for me			1
and at the same time i wanted to bring back the archives because @entity50 was known for the @entity59 silhouette , amazing tailoring and the most incredible embroideries , but i wanted to twist it with my edge , my generation			2
and i was excited to express all these feelings -- all my culture i had today with all the past of the house which is so huge and so interesting and impressive			1
@entity1 : how does your style differ from former creative director @entity71 ? @entity72 : i learned a lot from @entity71			1
and when i was working at @entity11 as an assistant and managing the studio , my job was translating everything he wanted in a fashion way			1
but @entity71 was from another age , another generation , loving different muses and icons			2
he was more into @entity83 , rock and roll and @entity85 , the 1980s			2
what i loved about him was all the sex appeal that he wanted to introduce to the house			1
but my generation is all hip hop , a different culture			1
even top models that inspire me did n't inspire him -- it is just a matter of generation			2
and i think what is important for me today is underlining the luxury of the house , maybe less jeans , less street wear , but keeping the dna of @entity50 and pushing the embroideries and the craftsmanship because this is something that i think is part of me , and part of the house at the same time			1
@entity1 : what is it about @entity46 that inspired you ? @entity72 : @entity46 has been my muse from the beginning			1
i have been listening to her albums since i was young and followed her career			2
i love women and i love wonder women -- those kind of women who have no boundaries and no ( limits ) and have this power to express themselves			0
and i had the chance to meet her two years ago and it was love at first sight -- literally			0
she showed me how to believe in myself and push the boundaries and limits at the same time keeping control of your life and that i think is the best i could learn from her			0
@entity1 : did you feel pressure for your first show for @entity11 in 2011 ? @entity72 : actually , i think the first show is the easiest one because you do n't know what you expect			1
but the first minute that i went out on the runway i just realized that my life is going to change			0
from the second show you realize what it means to be a creative director -- you are more exposed and people do n't see you just as a designer -- your personality is really important and they sometimes do n't judge you only on your clothes			1
@entity1 : what has been the greatest advantage -- and hindrance -- of your youth in this industry ? @entity72 : for me it is really important not to lose faith			0
when you are a baby you just dream to be the president -- you dream to be @entity160 or whatever -- you do n't have boundaries			0
and i think youth helps ( me ) to just believe and think there are no boundaries and no ( limits )			0
if i had this job at 45 or 40 , i do n't think i would do the same clothes , i do n't think i would express myself in the same way and thanks to my youth i believe so much and i push my boundaries so strongly			0
@entity1 : is it hard to stay grounded ? @entity72 : no , because i am close to people who are true and down to earth , and so for me it 's not like , ' oh i am only with celebrities or the woman who is 60 and wearing my clothes			2
' i have met so many celebrities who are arrogant and hardcore -- they are not my friends			0
i am just a simple person and maybe it seems weird to say that but sometimes the greatest luxury is to remain true to yourself			0
@entity1 : tell us about your love of @entity189			0
@entity72 : what is important in my career and my way of being a designer is @entity189			0
obviously people see i am selling a dress at $ 25,000 and that i have this life with celebrities , taking flights all the time ... but with my @entity189 people can realize who i am			0
i can wake up and do a selfie in my flat , go to the gym like 75 % of the population , you know , just be normal ! @entity1 : talk about the inspiration behind this collection			1
@entity72 : when @entity46 came to my after party last winter she was dressed in my leather skirt a beautiful see - through top , and she was kind of naked underneath			1
that inspired the whole collection			2
but it is a happy , joyful collection showing the state of my mind today			2
i am enjoying my work , i am celebrating my youth , my generation			0
there is a lot of work behind it , still keeping the couture element , still keeping this dreamy thing that i always have			0
@entity1 : what are the last minute preparations in the atelier ahead of the show like ? @entity72 : i 'm really a control freak ! at @entity11 , everything needs to come five days before -- that is my limit			1
but it is still very last minute but really exciting because obviously we get some ( pieces ) that are really well done , but with others you are like , ' @entity237 , i need to redo it ! ' i have an amazing team that believes in me and the brand			0
@entity1 : what , for you , is the sign of success ? @entity72 : when people who i am close to tell me that something is good			0
you know , in fashion you ca n't trust too many people			2
but the people who you trust , you can be sure of , and they are going to tell you the truth , when it 's bad and when it 's good and that 's what i want			2
but the most important thing is to please myself			0
if you are sure of yourself , if you like your show people are also going to love it			0
look : @entity257 in photos			0
