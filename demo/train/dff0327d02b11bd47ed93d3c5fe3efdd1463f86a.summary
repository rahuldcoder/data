-- @entity1 and the @entity3 world seem to be on a collision course that could have major political , economic and ideological ramifications			2
january 23 , 2012 , may well come to be remembered as the crucial date when @entity14 's " clash of civilizations " thesis , which many of us believed discredited beyond repair , was reaffirmed			0
political scientist @entity14 wrote in 1993 that cultural divisions preclude a defining global civilization , and the @entity17 and the @entity3 world would never share the same values			0
last month , @entity1 took two different actions that nonetheless sent the same message to the @entity3 world : you are not our equals and are doomed to be judged by standards different from those by which we judge ourselves			2
future historians might call january 23 the day when @entity1 irreversibly alienated not one , but both , pivotal powers -- @entity32 and @entity33 -- that in all probability will dominate the political landscape of the @entity36 for several decades			1
one action was the @entity39 's decision to ban oil purchases from @entity32 , including imports of crude oil , petroleum products and petrochemical products , to force @entity45 to negotiate away its uranium enrichment program , which @entity45 insists is for civilian use only			1
this is the latest in a series of increasingly stringent sanctions that @entity52 powers have unilaterally imposed on @entity32			2
these sanctions go well beyond those required by the @entity55			0
the @entity39 sanctions attempt to hit the @entity32 economy where it hurts most : @entity1 imports about a fifth of @entity32 oil			1
when combined with a ban on transactions with @entity32 's @entity63 , this action is aimed at paralyzing the @entity32 economy			1
at the same time , the @entity65 @entity64 passed a law making it a crime to deny genocides that are officially recognized by @entity65			0
the two genocides in this category are the @entity71 and the killing of 1.5 million @entity73 in @entity74 during the last years of the @entity75			0
because the denial of the holocaust is already a crime under @entity65 law , the obvious objective of the bill is to criminalize the denial of the 1915 @entity73 genocide			1
the issue of @entity73 genocide touches a very raw nerve in @entity33 , which denies the scale of the killings -- @entity33 maintains that roughly 500,000 @entity73 were killed -- as well as the claim that it was planned			1
according to @entity33 , the killings happened in the midst of the disarray accompanying @entity92 and the disintegration of the @entity75			0
@entity33 says a nearly equivalent number of @entity33 and @entity95 were also killed in inter-ethnic strife with the @entity73 , who were allied with the @entity75 's @entity98 adversaries			1
it 's not the accuracy of the opposing claims that is at issue ; it 's @entity3 perceptions			0
@entity32 may well be trying to develop nuclear weapons , and what amounts to an @entity73 genocide may well have taken place			1
what roils @entity3 opinion worldwide is the perception that the @entity17 uses blatant double standards to pass judgment			2
harsh sanctions on @entity32 are seen as an attempt to prevent a @entity3 country from developing deterrents to attacks from @entity118 and the @entity119 , both nuclear powers hostile to the @entity121			2
most @entity52 discussions of the @entity32 bomb do not make even passing reference to the well - documented @entity118 nuclear capability , even as @entity118 threatens to militarily strike @entity32 's nuclear facilities			1
this omission is seen as hypocritical , dishonest and self - serving			0
for many in the @entity3 world , double standards explain why @entity65 singled out @entity33 , and did n't criminalize the denial of other nations ' crimes against humanity			1
although denying @entity137 's crimes is a crime , the holocaust is universally accepted as genocide , while @entity33 's is not			2
many ask why disputing @entity1 massacres of @entity143 people is not criminalized -- such as the @entity65 actions in @entity145 , as @entity33 prime minister @entity146 has said			1
these would include the near - total extermination of native populations by @entity1 settlers in @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152			0
they would include the killings of millions of people by the @entity156 administration of the @entity157 , whose population was halved during the early decades of @entity156 rule			0
most pertinent of all , @entity161 ask , why not criminalize the denial of the genocidal @entity164 that led to the extermination , expulsion or conversion of the entire @entity3 and @entity169 populations of the @entity170 ? many @entity161 perceive these moves as the @entity17 targeting @entity32 and @entity33 in an attempt to prevent important @entity3 countries from achieving the military capacity -- @entity32 -- and the political stature -- @entity33 -- they deserve			1
many see behind these moves the not - so - hidden hand of an ideology based on @entity14 's theory of the clash of civilizations			0
although these perceptions may not fully conform with reality , it is well established that perceptions count much more than reality in the conduct of international relations			0
follow @entity191 on @entity192 join the conversation on @entity194 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : @entity1 took actions that showed @entity161 not viewed as equal
he says one was ban on buying @entity32 's oil as part of sanctions for nuclear enrichment
other was @entity65 senate outlawing denial of @entity73 genocide ; @entity33 denies it
@entity197 : many @entity161 see these as alienating : double standards applied in judgment of them
