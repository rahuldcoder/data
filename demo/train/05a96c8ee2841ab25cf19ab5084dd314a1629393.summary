-- i had an experience recently that reinvigorated my faith in humanity -- and bureaucracy			1
i 'd left my suitcase in the trunk of a yellow cab in @entity9 and did n't realize it till 20 minutes later			1
i did not have a receipt or any way to identify the cab or the driver			1
i was at the start of a four - day , three - city trip			2
for almost three hours , various people tried to help me -- two folks at my bank , whose credit card held the only record of the cab ride ; three people at two yellow cab companies based in @entity25 ; a service rep at the @entity27 ; people in my office back in @entity29			1
as the workday ended , i finally went to the drugstore for some toiletries			2
my fiancee shipped me some clothes , and i retreated glumly to my hotel room			2
then , at 9:48 p.m. , @entity37 from the @entity38 called me			2
she 'd been working overtime on my case , used gps records to identify the cab and located and called the cabbie -- and he still had my bag ! he was an @entity45 immigrant named @entity46 , and he remembered me ( or , rather , my crew - cut hair )			1
he had n't seen my name card under a flap on the backside of the bag and was planning in the morning to ask the @entity38 to help track me down			0
i called him -- he was working at his second job			0
we arranged for him to drop the bag off the next morning			0
when i thanked @entity37 for navigating the system so relentlessly , she insisted she was just doing her job			0
when i thanked @entity46 for his help , he cheerfully said , " it 's the @entity59 way ! " my happy - ending story offers a few lessons			1
one is obvious : always , always get a receipt			0
another is that @entity9 , contrary to popular belief and their own callous pose , are essentially nice			1
but the third , even more deeply contrary to popular belief , is that government is not the enemy			1
government is not inherently inept			1
it 's simply us -- and as defective or capable of goodness as we are			1
today , several weeks into the botched launch of @entity76 's exchanges and several more since the shutdown , the faith of the people in government is weak and weakening further			1
this trend long predates @entity76 , and its sources are bipartisan			0
@entity83 who favor more active government have tolerated an ever - more complex and impersonal state , while @entity87 who want to shrink government love to showcase the breakdowns that complexity -- and @entity87 - led underfunding -- can bring			2
what 's striking , though , is that both sides have learned to see and speak of government the same way -- as a disembodied thing , a mechanism separate from citizens			1
@entity83 tend to forget and @entity87 like to deny the simple reality that government is nothing more than our best attempt to do certain things together that we ca n't do alone			2
like ensure that we are all insured against health catastrophes			0
or keep toxic foods out of our babies ' mouths			0
or send humans to the moon			0
or design smart transportation systems on @entity113			0
when government fails , the proper response is n't fatalism ; it 's activism			1
the question to ask in the wake of something such as the failure of the healthcare.gov launch is n't why was n't i better served but rather , what could i do to make it better ? to be sure , there are reasons why " government bureaucracy " is n't a phrase usually said in gratitude			1
three times in my luggage adventure , i was abruptly disconnected from the @entity38 hotline after being on hold a cumulative 45 minutes			2
after the third time , i felt disillusioned			0
sitting there in the midst of a vast uncaring city , imagining that my bag had been stolen and its contents dispersed , i felt awakened to the hard cold world			0
but when i got the call from @entity37 , that cynicism receded -- and so did the victim - story i 'd started to tell myself			0
though @entity37 was an exceptionally dedicated public employee , she was only part of a web of people -- everyday citizens and workers in government and business -- who 'd come together to solve this particular problem			1
in the scheme of things , that problem and its resolution were utterly insignificant			0
but they reminded me that we @entity59 carry an often unspoken privilege -- the privilege of expecting that things should function as promised and that civic institutions should be trustworthy and responsive			0
this expectation of a working public sphere does n't prevail in other less healthy societies			0
my immigrant cabbie @entity46 described this willingness to trust , to look out for one another -- to do our part to make complex systems work -- as the @entity59 way			2
but it 's only the @entity59 way if we make it so			1
the cardinal rule of citizenship is that society becomes how we behave			0
if we behave as if the state is there to serve us perfectly or else be eviscerated , we 'll get a society where citizens forget how to serve , help , forgive or collaborate			0
everyone has some say over whether government does well			2
finding that voice and claiming that responsibility feels good -- almost as good as finding a lost suitcase			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : i had an experience that gave me more faith in humanity , bureaucracy
**liu** : many people helped me after i lost my luggage in a cab in @entity9
he says one of the lessons he learned is that government is not the enemy
**liu** : government is not inherently inept ; it 's as bad or good as we make it
