those referred to court also include five @entity15 , two @entity16 and three @entity17 , said @entity18 , spokesman for the general prosecutor			2
the remaining people are @entity7 , he said			0
the defendants include @entity22 , @entity23 country director and the son of @entity4 transportation secretary @entity25 , @entity18 said			1
the defendants were named by an investigation committee created by @entity7 's justice minister , @entity7 's state - run @entity26 reported			2
" we have seen media reports that judicial officials in @entity7 intend to forward a number of cases involving @entity4 - funded ngos to the @entity0 criminal court , " said @entity30 , deputy spokesman for the @entity31			1
" we are deeply concerned by these reports and are seeking clarification from the government of @entity7			1
" @entity7 authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 @entity37 in late december , but offered no clear explanation for the raids as they happened			1
a spokesman with the general prosecutor 's office said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations the groups had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license			1
three @entity4 - based organizations operating in @entity7 were part of the raids			1
@entity7 police confiscated everything from desks , cell phones , documents and computers to office safes , @entity66 with the @entity67 told @entity1 in an interview just after the raids			2
@entity4 - based @entity70 and the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) reported their offices were raided as well			1
despite assurances the @entity31 says were given to the @entity4 ambassador by @entity7 authorities , two of the @entity37 said that as of early january , no property or cash had been returned			1
" we had been assured by leaders in the @entity7 government that this issue would be resolved , that harassment would end , that @entity37 would be allowed to go back to business as usual and that their property would be returned , " @entity31 spokesman @entity77 said last month			1
" it is , frankly , unacceptable to us that that situation has not been returned to normal			0
" defense secretary @entity86 and @entity4 ambassador @entity87 both spoke with high - ranking @entity7 officials following the raids to voice their concern			1
@entity77 said last month there are apparently " some @entity93 holdovers in the government who do n't seem to understand how these organizations operate in a democratic society , and are putting out lots of disinformation about them			0
" @entity100 called sunday for @entity7 authorities to drop the charges and stop the criminal investigation into the @entity37			1
" the @entity7 authorities are using a discredited @entity93 - era law to prosecute nongovernmental groups while proposing even more restrictive legislation , " said @entity103 , @entity100 's deputy @entity104 director , in a statement			2
" the government should stop using the old law , halt the criminal investigations and propose a law that respects international standards			0
" the @entity23 said in a statement sunday the reported prosecution " reflects escalating attacks against international and @entity7 democracy organizations , " calling it a " politically motivated assault			0
" @entity7 officials have called it a " legitimate judicial process , " the organization said , but " the continued assault on @entity4 , @entity16 and @entity7 civil society is not a ' legitimate judicial process			1
' it is a politically motivated effort to squash @entity7 's growing civil society , orchestrated through the courts , in part by @entity93 - era holdovers			0
" the @entity67 said in a statement that while it does not know specifically which individuals or organizations are implicated , it was " deeply concerned about this development			1

" @entity67 applied for registration through the @entity140 in 2005 and has fulfilled all of the registration requirements for the past six years , including a number of updates provided in january			0
" in late january , @entity4 government officials said @entity22 was among three @entity4 taking refuge in the @entity147 in @entity0 because they voiced concerns about their personal safety			1
" we do not believe they were in physical danger , but they had concerns , and they were invited by the embassy , " @entity77 said , explaining that the @entity4 had approached embassy staff			2
" this was a unique situation , " @entity77 said , adding that those in the @entity147 are not trying to avoid the legal process			0
@entity22 said while he felt " safe physically , " he was concerned that the investigation into the work of @entity4 non-governmental organizations has " taken on a more serious nature , and the next step from here would either be arrest or go to trial			1
" @entity7 's investigation of and raids on @entity4 democracy support groups working in that country could mean the end of @entity4 aid to @entity7 , members of @entity166 told top @entity174 administration officials , as well as the head of @entity7 's @entity176 , last week			1
in a february 2 letter to secretary of state @entity179 and @entity86 , 41 members of @entity166 urged the administration to withhold further aid to @entity7 until the country 's leadership lets the offices of those organizations reopen and returns seized property			2
members of @entity166 issue warning on @entity4 aid to @entity7 the @entity4 sends more than $ 1.3 billion each year in military aid to @entity7 , according to the @entity31			1
and , since 1975 , the @entity191 has provided more than $ 28 billion in economic and development assistance to @entity7			0
" the absence of a quick and satisfactory resolution to this issue will make it increasingly difficult for congressional supporters of a strong @entity4 - @entity7 bilateral relationship to defend current levels of assistance to @entity7 , especially in this climate of budget cuts in @entity204 , " the letter warns			2
" it 's essential that @entity7 not take any legal action whatsoever against these @entity37 workers , " rep. @entity205 , @entity207 - @entity206 and chairman of the @entity209 , said sunday			0
the @entity176 , @entity7 's ruling military council , assumed control of the government following the ouster of longtime president @entity93 last year			0
" we 're being accused of things we 've never done , " @entity23 president @entity23 said last month			0
" we are told we have operated without registration , and that is true because we filed our registration papers five and a half years ago			0
we were told the papers are complete and we 're still waiting			0
" " we 've operated for 30 years , everywhere from ( dictator @entity224 ) @entity226 's @entity225 to @entity227 , to the @entity228 when it was the @entity228 , to @entity230 , to @entity231 under @entity232 , " he said			0
" we work in @entity233 , @entity234			0
this has never , ever happened in the 30 years where we get our offices raided			2
and @entity7 is supposed to be an @entity4 friend			2
" @entity1 's @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
