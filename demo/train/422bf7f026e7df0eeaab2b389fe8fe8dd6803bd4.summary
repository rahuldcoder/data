@entity1 teeth may contain the strongest biological material ever discovered , say researchers in the @entity5			1
the aquatic , dome - shaped creatures that are found clinging to rocky shores have set a new record previously held by spiders			0
" until now we thought that spider silk was the strongest biological material because of its super-strength and potential applications in everything from bullet - proof vests to computer electronics , " professor @entity10 who led the study said in a statement			1
" but now we have discovered that limpet teeth exhibit a strength that is potentially higher			1
" the researchers from the @entity24 's @entity23 said they used atomic force microscopy to pull apart the material , almost 100 times thinner than the diameter of human hair , right down to the atom			2
the findings were published in the @entity31 journal @entity32			0
they are not only surprising , but @entity10 said they are a source of inspiration for engineering , setting the blueprint for structures such as @entity41 racing cars , boat hulls and aircrafts			1
" all the things we observe around us , such as trees , the shells of sea creatures and the limpet teeth studied in this work , have evolved to be effective at what they do , " said @entity10			1
the key substance in the tiny teeth is a hard mineral known as goethite , which forms in the limpet as it grows and enables them to move over rock surfaces and feed on algae while the tide is in			2
and the teeth maintain their strength regardless of their size			0
" generally a big structure has lots of flaws and can break more easily than a smaller structure , which has fewer flaws and is stronger			0
the problem is that most structures have to be fairly big so they 're weaker than we would like			0
" @entity1 teeth break this rule as their strength is the same no matter what the size			0

researchers in the @entity5 say limpet teeth may contain the strongest *natural* material known to man
spider silk was previously thought to be the strongest substance
the findings are a source of inspiration for engineering , such as the structures of *f1* cars and aircrafts
