-- ten months into the uprising in @entity5 , deadly clashes between opposition fighters and government forces have now spread to suburbs just 15 minutes from the heart of the capital @entity9			1
what 's the latest on the ground ? @entity5 's humanitarian crisis is worsening as armed rebels and government forces battle for control of towns and cities across the country			1
much of @entity20 , in the eastern suburbs of @entity9 , faces a " complete siege and closure " after days of sustained bombings that has killed dozens , according to the opposition @entity21			2
electricity , water , heating fuel and food are in short supply , and communications have been interrupted , the @entity21 said , as @entity5 forces battle to take back neighborhoods located uncomfortably close to president @entity35 's seat of power in the capital			1
at least 37 people were confirmed dead across several cities tuesday , according to the @entity21			0
the group reported 100 deaths monday			0
a resident of @entity43 said six members of one family were found dead			0
in one part of @entity43 , @entity5 forces battled to take back a neighborhood from the rebel army and anti-government protesters , according to an opposition activist who asked that his identity be withheld over a fear of government reprisal			1
the dead and wounded littered the streets of the neighborhood , which was under siege , the activist said			0
more than 5,000 people have died since march , when the government launched a crackdown against demonstrators , according to the @entity63			0
opposition groups estimate a higher death toll , with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people			0
how is the international community reacting ? the @entity69 suspended its monitoring mission in @entity5 on saturday , recalling all of its observers around the country to @entity9 as violence escalates			1
while some @entity69 monitors will leave the country , others will stay in @entity9 , but none will be conducting missions at this time , according to @entity79 , senior advisor to @entity69 secretary general @entity80			1
on tuesday , the @entity81 failed to reach an agreement on a resolution that would call for @entity35 to step down			0
@entity85 and @entity86 diplomats voiced their support for the draft resolution , but representatives from @entity90 and @entity91 slammed it as meddlesome			1
@entity90 -- which , like @entity91 , is one of the five veto - wielding permanent members of the @entity81 -- has said it is concerned about a @entity5 civil war and does not want @entity35 pushed out of power			1
it has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both @entity35 and the opposition			0
the draft that will now be considered also lacks sanctions but is tougher than the earlier version , which said nothing about transfer of power			0
the @entity5 regime has been under international pressure to stop the crackdown -- and the @entity63 , the @entity110 , the @entity111 and some members of the @entity69 have called for president @entity35 to step down			1
what did the @entity69 monitors achieve in @entity5 ? the @entity69 monitoring mission in @entity5 has been criticized for failing to stop the @entity35 regime 's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests across the country			1
read profile of president @entity35 but the head of the @entity69 observers in @entity5 , @entity122 gen. @entity121 , said the mission was designed not to bring an immediate end to violence but to investigate and observe the situation			1
the choice of @entity130 to lead the mission was controversial in itself : he was part of the @entity122 security establishment that put down the rebellion in the breakaway region of @entity135 a decade ago			0
still , one expert says the @entity69 mission , which began on december 26 , kept the world 's attention focused on @entity5 at a time when attention had been slipping away			1
" the presence of monitors served to galvanize the opposition , and we saw an increased number of demonstrations and anti-government activity during that time period , " @entity143 professor @entity142 from @entity144 told @entity0			0
" but as a consequence we also saw the government step up its visible repression of the protesters			0
" while critics say @entity35 has used the @entity69 mission as a cover to continue suppression of protests in @entity5 , @entity142 says it was important that the @entity69 be seen to be acting on the @entity5 crisis before taking the issue up with bigger organizations			1
" @entity69 have now exhausted their own internal options and they can be seen to have taken action themselves to try to resolve the crisis , " said @entity142			2
" it would now seem legitimate for the @entity69 to now turn to larger bodies , certainly the @entity63 , to take action itself			2
" individual states in the @entity69 have called for @entity35 to step down , but the organization as a whole has failed to table a similar resolution -- and @entity142 says that is unlikely to change anytime soon			2
" while it seems likely there is going to be some internal negotiation ( on a resolution ) taking place , it certainly seems very unlikely @entity181 or @entity182 -- states who are allied effectively to @entity184 and @entity5 -- will ever join calls for @entity35 to stand down , " said @entity142			2
will the international community intervene like it did in @entity187 ? nothing will happen in terms of military intervention in @entity5 unless @entity90 changes its current stance , according to @entity142			1
" @entity90 have said quite clearly that they 're not going to support anything that would risk @entity35 being forced from power , " @entity142 told @entity0			2
" if @entity90 gave the same kind of green light for @entity5 that it did for @entity187 , there 's every possibility that you 'd see military intervention , probably coming out of @entity202 , " @entity142 said			1
" but @entity202 have said they 're highly reluctant to intervene unless they have @entity206 or @entity63 backing			0
" rights group @entity207 urged @entity90 wednesday to rethink its opposition to the latest draft			2
" @entity90 's threats to abort a binding @entity81 resolution on @entity5 for the second time are utterly irresponsible			1
@entity90 bears a heavy responsibility for allowing the brutal crackdown on legitimate dissent in @entity5 to continue unchecked , " said @entity213 , @entity207 's representative to the @entity63			1
" @entity90 must work with other @entity81 members to pass a strong and legally binding resolution that will help to end the bloodshed and human rights violations in @entity5 once and for all			1
" is the opposition united against the @entity35 regime ? the longer the fighting goes on in @entity5 , activists and @entity86 diplomats say , the more radicalized the revolution is becoming			1
fringe elements of @entity230 extremist groups are moving in and sectarian rifts are widening as feelings of despair descend on some flashpoint @entity5 cities			2
while the besieged city of @entity43 has traditionally been a place of religious tolerance , " there is a real sense now that that is changing and being manipulated by people on both sides " of the conflict , according to @entity142			0
president @entity35 belongs to the @entity230 sect while @entity245 form the majority in @entity5			2
" the older sunni merchant class that feel the city is theirs rightfully are now turning on the @entity230 , who they see as these recent migrants that do n't actually belong in the city , " said @entity142			0
many @entity254 have fled to @entity9 as communities begin to divide on sectarian lines			0
salafists -- @entity259 radicals , many of whom have brought terror tactics honed in neighboring @entity182 -- are moving into @entity43			0
hard - liners inside and outside the country are already jockeying for post-al - @entity35 power , while the @entity230 community fears the prospect of persecution if the government falls			0
" the regime is trying to persuade the @entity230 that if they abandon the government , they will be wiped out in the dog - eat - dog aftermath , " @entity142 said			0
@entity0 's @entity273 , @entity274 , and @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
