-- the crowd of farmers in the @entity4 's @entity3 cheered loudly whenever the neatly groomed candidate came out with a new promise			2
@entity7 ! schools ! better social services ! a better future ! he smiled broadly as the cheering swelled , wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief			2
he wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar , under a well - cut blue blazer			2
he was the picture of authority and self - confidence			2
afterward , one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers			1
" there is no one else , " he told me			0
" the other candidates do n't care about @entity30			1
they 've been hired ! " his candidate , @entity31 , easily won the election , back in september 2005 , though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor			1
it was another " historic " election , the first multi-candidate presidential election ever , though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the @entity30 state			1
today , @entity31 is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a @entity49 hospital , awaiting the verdict from his trial in early june			1
much has changed since the last presidential election , but much remains the same			1
@entity31 came from the military , and the military , in the form of the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , still runs the country			1
while @entity56 has tried to talk the talk of the new era , all of its members rose through the ranks of the @entity30 military with the blessings of @entity31			1
according to the @entity68 cables posted on the internet by @entity70 , midlevel @entity30 army officers referred to @entity71 , the head of @entity56 , as " @entity31 's poodle			1
" @entity56 has overseen the process that led to this presidential election , in which @entity30 had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot ( although two pulled out of the race )			1
since @entity31 stepped down on february 11 , 2011 , @entity56 has stumbled from one crisis to another , reacting with violence and brutality against protesters , but often ceding ground when @entity87 filled and passions boiled			1
@entity56 has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june			0
in theory , @entity30 is on the cusp of monumental change			1
these are heady days in @entity30			1
everyone seems to be pontificating on politics , comparing candidates , pondering platforms			0
the airwaves are full of it , @entity102 and @entity103 are abuzz with it , the streets are festooned with posters and banners			0
on the surface it seems so different from the predictable , managed , officially sanctioned politics of the @entity31 years			1
but the choice facing @entity30 is , actually , little changed			1
under the old regime , @entity31 made it clear he was the champion of the status quo , holding back the @entity117 tide , led by the then - banned but tolerated @entity118			1
in this election , voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later @entity127 secretary general @entity126 or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister @entity129			2
or they can opt for a new @entity131 order , either with the full - on @entity118 candidate , @entity134 - educated @entity133 , or the islamic - lite candidate @entity135			0
add to the mix @entity137 , a @entity138 who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists			2
in recent days @entity137 's numbers have been rising , perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front - runners			2
the establishment -- the bureaucracy , the military , the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly does n't want to see the @entity117 come to power			2
tuesday , the semi-official @entity49 daily , @entity153 , ran an ominous page - three story with the headline : " beware of a military coup : the future will be frightening if the @entity118 reaches the summit of power			2
" the source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief @entity163 , quoted in the @entity166 @entity165 daily @entity164			0
he painted a grim picture of the @entity118 setting up a revolutionary guard , along the lines of @entity171 , to fight against the @entity30 military			1
the military , he warned , does not know how cunning the @entity118 can be			2
another @entity49 daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the @entity117 candidates wins it would be " @entity176 " -- a @entity178 plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon @entity30 , with a breakdown in security , violence , kidnapping , thuggery and theft , massive capital flight , political isolation , unemployment , poverty , and illness			1
on top of all that , once the @entity117 have power , the paper predicted , they will murder all their political opponents			0
those who are opposed to the @entity118 tend to see them as forked - tongue @entity198 in ties , eager to impose @entity131 law , force women to cover up , and ban alcohol			0
but for @entity30 struggling with rising prices and low wages , the @entity118 offers the promise of a better future			1
indeed , the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo 's table			0
@entity212 , a bank clerk living in the old @entity49 district of @entity214 , will be voting for @entity133 of the @entity118			0
" the health system is in bad shape , as is education , " he says			0
" conditions for people in @entity30 are very , very bad			1
" in the @entity4 city of @entity222 , farmer @entity220 attended a crowded @entity118 rally , eager to hear @entity133 speak			0
he supports the @entity118 , he told me , because they are champions of what matters to him : " justice , transparency , implementation of @entity131 law , the plight of the poor farmers , and unemployment			0
" the @entity118 's political wing , the @entity235 , won more than 40 % of the seats in @entity30 's lower house of @entity238 in recent elections			1
after being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades , they are finally free to operate , and are n't shy about flexing their muscles			0
@entity243 , a young @entity118 member , sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power			0
" we came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people , " he says			0
" what we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground , and we ca n't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power			0
" it would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power			0
the @entity118 is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout			0
they did it for the parliamentary elections and they 'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well			0
but the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the @entity118 worries many			0
@entity272 works in the @entity273 , and voted for the @entity118			0
but he feels they are novices in power , grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament , but doing little else			0
" they have no political background , " he says dismissive contempt , like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop			0
polls of potential voters have been all over the place , but they do show that a majority of @entity30 have yet to make up their minds			1
they debate the choices in taxis and buses , in the subway , in cafes , over breakfast , lunch and dinner , over @entity103 and on @entity102 , changing their minds between meals			2
one seasoned veteran of @entity30 politicsâ € ” who requested anonymityâ € ” chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters , and puts it this way : " this is the first time i 've ever had people ask me , ' who do you think is going to win the presidential election ? ' i honestly have no idea			1

much has changed since the last presidential election
