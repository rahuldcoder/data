@entity0 , @entity1 -- we met her in the car park of a small shopping mall on the edge of @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
she was too shy to get out of the car her friend had brought her in , too nervous of who might see , or what might be overheard			0
she told us that she knew an isolated place where we could talk			0
ten minutes later we are in scrubland standing by the rubble and remains of someone 's home			2
here @entity18 - not her real name - stops fiddling with her plastic necklace and starts looking me in the eye , but even that appears to take considerable effort			0
she tells me that for the last two years , since both her parents died in a car crash , she has lived on the periphery , isolated from her remaining family and society			0
" right now i do n't feel that i am a human being " she confesses			0
" right now i am scared to greet my family because if i say that i am a prostitute all of the people will just say that i am a prostitute "			2
she wants us to know that this was not her first choice ; she did try to find work			2
" here in @entity1 there are no jobs " she says			1
the necklace fiddling starts again			0
" i have no choice to be a sex worker , whether i like it or not , i must do that "			2
tucked away in one corner of @entity1 's annual @entity44 we find the @entity42 stands			1
it is an unusual addition at a trade fair but then so is the large number of children who have come here for a day out with their parents ; there is barely a businessman or woman in sight			2
these stands are testimony to a tragic accolade ; @entity1 has the highest rate of @entity42 and @entity42 in the world			1
a staggering one in four people have @entity42 in @entity1			1

the free condoms on her table seem to have attracted quite a crowd			0
her organization offers support and education to sex workers and she believes there is a growing number of women , just like @entity18 , who are turning to prostitution because of the country 's financial woes			1
" everyone needs food , those are basic needs and the unemployment rate is quite high so sex work for most people is a livelihood you know "			1
and the situation is likely to get worse she warns me			0
" you are going to be seeing more and more people engaging in different kinds of work , including sex work			1
" @entity1 's government blames the financial woes on a drop in income from the @entity102 following a new tariff deal			1
organizations like the @entity105 have urged @entity1 's government to cut its bloated civil service , reduce spending and attract foreign investors			1

a three hundred and fifty five million dollar bailout was agreed but so far , none of that money has materialized			1
@entity130 , @entity1 's finance minister , tells me			1
" right now i am not sure , we are waiting for the @entity122 to engage with us whether that money is still available or not and if it is then we will gladly take it			1
it will assist us in meeting some of the fiscal challenges that we are currently facing but if it is not available then we are already taking steps to say let 's look at what we have			0
" critics of @entity141 believe he and his array of wives have contributed to the financial demise of this small landlocked kingdom			0
there are reports of shopping trips to @entity149 , a private jet from a private sponsor and plans for a second international airport for a country with just over one million people			2
however , the country 's finance minister denies this			1
" i can assure you that his majesty , the @entity162 , they never overspend in what they have been allocated			0
if there are any challenges then they are in other ministries , " he tells me when we met him in his office			0
" those who would blame it on his majesty they do not have the information , he never overspends , we discuss the fiscal challenges on a weekly basis , i brief him , he has concerns and he will , as he did this year , say whatever you work do n't even increase my budget because i understand the fiscal situation			2

while i was not raped i was @entity42 negative because i did not like to sleep with a man without a condom			0
" she and around 20 other women working in the neighborhood hide in the shadows of the night waiting for a car to pull up			0
to feed herself she says she has to have sex with twenty men in two weeks " but sometimes in a day i used to sleep with five or six men "			0
like many people who are struggling to make a living in @entity1 , there is no respite or prospect of a bailout			1
" in this work we will die so while they do not think about us i do not think they are making an improvement in this country			2
