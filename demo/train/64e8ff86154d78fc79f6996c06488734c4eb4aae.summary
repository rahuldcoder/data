editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , is professor of psychiatry at judge @entity5 and @entity7 in @entity8 , and co-author with @entity10 of " come on people : on the path from victims to @entity14 , " 2007			2
dr. @entity2 says while we salute @entity17 and @entity18 , there 's more work to be done			1
@entity8 , @entity20 ( @entity21 ) -- today , one day before the inauguration of the first @entity26 - @entity26 president , the @entity17 observance hailing civil rights gains will be combined with jubilation over @entity18 's historic achievement			1
the festivities this year portend a new direction for the @entity17 holiday			2
on monday , we salute @entity17 - and - @entity18			1
and on tuesday , we salute @entity18 - and - @entity17 , as the rev. @entity32 , co-founder of the @entity34 with @entity17 , gives the benediction after @entity18 's swearing - in			1
the events juxtapose two @entity26 icons in the march toward racial equality			2
traditional tributes to @entity17 are likely to be overshadowed by @entity18 's game - changing win ; his success , despite racial barriers , mistakenly leads many @entity26 to believe that @entity17 's rallying cries may be outdated			1
for example , at most celebrations , the " @entity48 " speech is highlighted			0
with the election of @entity18 , many are saying that we have fulfilled @entity17 's dream			1
so will the " dream " speech be appreciated only as a powerful historical moment rather than a vision for the future ? i hope not			0
but other perspectives may change as well			0
in stirring oratory , @entity17 said he had a dream that one day his four children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character			2
but now , since @entity18 's accomplishment , scores of people -- including @entity26 -- feel we have reached that goal , despite obvious remnants of racial discrimination			1
in fact , some conservatives are using @entity18 's success to argue against the need for affirmative action			1
similarly , @entity17 's oft - quoted words : " i 've seen the @entity81			1
i may not get there with you ... " will resonate in a different way because of @entity18 's startling election			1
i have heard many reports from black people themselves that the president - elect has taken us symbolically to that elusive @entity81			2
while @entity18 's win may have taken the edge off some of @entity17 's inspirational rhetoric , it should not lead to complacency in the fight for social justice			1
there is still much work to be done			0
@entity18 's election does not solve the many problems facing the @entity26 - @entity26 community			1
we will continue to face disparities in health care , including an infant mortality rate twice as high as whites , and 20 percent of blacks still lack basic health insurance , according to government statistics			0
. high rates of crime and violence , with homicide as the leading cause of death for young black men , demoralizes black neighborhoods			0
in many communities , the high school dropout rate exceeds 50 percent			0
that dropout rate for many is a ticket to prison , where blacks make up nearly 40 percent of inmates , according to the @entity127			0
racial profiling has not ended , and there continue to be horrific incidents of police brutality against blacks			0
this compounds family stress at a time when federal government data shows 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers and @entity26 - @entity26 unemployment is twice the rate of whites			1
these challenges were there before the dramatic economic downturn of recent months ; they will get worse if there are no interventions			0
@entity18 is doing his share by reinvigorating @entity17 's primary theme of helping others by urging @entity26 ' commitment to the @entity151 , established by @entity152 in 1994			1
his emphasis on volunteering is an appropriate extension of @entity17 's ultimate mission			2
people can not simply have high expectations about what @entity18 can do for them but must also work as individuals and communities to support his programs to help pull the @entity163 out of its economic and social crises			2
this january , the link established between the civil rights achievements of @entity17 's dream and @entity18 's triumph will be etched in our minds			1
that is not a bad thing			0
it gives us an opportunity to broaden the celebrations on @entity178			2
the king holiday would be enhanced by recognizing other modern civil rights icons as well			0
luminaries such as @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , rev. @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and a host of others should not be allowed to fade into the background			0
without diminishing the extraordinary legacy of @entity17 , other leaders who have contributed to the emancipation of black americans should be remembered			0
@entity18 's watershed moment brings a new spirit to the @entity178 observance			1
eventually , i hope due credit will be given to all those fighters whose shoulders @entity18 stood on to secure the ultimate prize : the presidency of the @entity163			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity2 .			0

@entity2 says this year 's @entity178 is special
he says it 's a *prelude* to inauguration of first @entity26 - @entity26 president
@entity2 : it 's a mistake to think @entity18 's election means @entity17 's dream is done
he says we still have a long way to go to ensure all races have equal opportunity
