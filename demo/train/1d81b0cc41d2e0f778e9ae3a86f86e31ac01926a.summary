@entity0 -- the @entity2 may announce as soon as this weekend a plan to bring up to 400,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work , according to two @entity2 officials			1
@entity1 has learned the plan is in the final stages of being written and approved			1
if all are returned to work , it would represent about half the number of government civilian and contract employees at risk of furloughs during the government shutdown that began on tuesday			1
the partisan congressional stalemate over spending for the current fiscal year shows no sign of ending anytime soon			0
details of the @entity2 plan were being worked out on exactly which employees would be brought back and how they would be notified			1
the officials declined to be identified because the plan has not yet been announced			0
but defense secretary @entity24 made his view clear while traveling in @entity26			0
" we were forced by law to furlough many , many of our civilian workers			0
but we 're trying to find a solid legal interpretation here in the law that can bring back more people in support of our military , " he said			1
it 's expected the @entity2 will issue a broad statement from @entity39 saying he is authorizing employees back to work followed by detailed memos about the recall would work			1
@entity46 administration lawyers have been working to interpret how much leeway they were given by @entity48 over personnel in a measure approved just before the shutdown took effect that ensured troops would continue to be paid during a government closure			1
language in the law said civilian personnel and contractors will be paid if the secretary of defense " determines " they are providing " support " for the troops and several members of @entity48 have said that gives @entity39 broad authority			2
but the two officials said lawyers were still working on what that means because the law does not specifically say all employees can come back			2
" the question is who works here at the department who supports troops ? " one official said			0
there will have to be some legal finding as to what jobs and which personnel specifically support troops , both officials said			0
but @entity2 officials are well aware that @entity39 is pressuring to bring everyone back to work next week			2
" there 's no job in our @entity2 that does n't support the military			0
so , i think theoretically -- i 'm not a lawyer , but i do have some appreciation for common sense , and common sense tells you that if you 're working for the @entity2 , you 're supporting the defense and the security of @entity95 , and you 're supporting those who are on the front lines , " @entity39 said .			0
