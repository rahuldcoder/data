-- as a shivering and nervous new recruit to the @entity3 in 2007 -- wearing three layers just to keep warm -- @entity5 began to seriously question why he had left the tropical @entity6 of @entity7			1
" everyone just looked at me and burst out laughing , " he told @entity0 's @entity9 series			0
with limited grasp of the @entity13 language , @entity5 had to bite his lip and take his medicine to earn the respect of his colleagues in the @entity18 , a tank regiment based in @entity20			1
but fast forward six years and @entity5 has had the last laugh because when he is not patrolling the front line with the army in dangerous trouble spots such as @entity25 , he is charging to the try line at the home of rugby union @entity28			1
the skills he acquired playing barefoot as a child back home in rugby - mad @entity7 -- where kids often use bottles because they have no ball -- earned him a place in the @entity3 representative side and it was not long before professional clubs took an interest			1
still a serving officer , risen to the rank of @entity43 , @entity5 signed a professional contract with leading @entity46 side @entity45 at the start of 2012 - 13 season			1
@entity49 rookie now 25 , his swift and aggressive running has seen him impress despite his rookie status and he scored a fine try in a recent win over one of the most successful clubs in @entity57 rugby , @entity58			1
it 's a highly unusual double life and he reminds his new teammates that although rugby is a tough and physical sport , the lifestyle is a world apart from active service			0
" i 've been telling the boys at @entity45 , we do four patrols a day and you have to do that for every single day , there 's no saturday or sunday , where you get days off			2
it 's a hard life			0
" but @entity5 also believes the teamwork ethic that is necessary for very survival in a theater of conflict such as @entity25 can cross over to sports			1
" trusting the guys beside you it is basically the same thing out there and on the rugby field as well , " he said			0
" @entity85 bonding is a massive thing out there , you have to trust every single one in front of you , left right and behind you			0
" @entity5 's performance for the @entity3 against the @entity92 in the traditional annual match at a packed @entity28 last year -- running in a hat - trick of tries -- brought him to national prominence for the first time			1
given his outstanding performances in the pro game with @entity45 , expectations were high for the 2013 edition last weekend			2
record crowd a record crowd of over 72,000 watched the match -- the increased interest echoing the hullabaloo which surrounds the army - navy clash in collegiate gridiron football in the @entity109 -- and the @entity7 ace did not disappoint			1
another hat - trick of tries helped the @entity3 team to another thrilling 43 - 26 victory over their arch rivals			0
just setting foot for the first time on the turf at the " @entity120 " of the sport was an eye opener for @entity5 , given the rudimentary facilities he had grown up with			2
" i thought , ' @entity125 , this is @entity28			2
' i 've just heard about this place and watching it on telly , i never realized that i would set foot on a ground like this			0
" i was thinking back to my primary school life , playing rugby barefoot , chasing people around , smashing each other up ! " @entity136 is the national sport in @entity7 -- a former colony of the @entity139 , hence the tradition of young men from the @entity6 joining its armed forces			1
@entity5 's uncle followed that route and inspired his nephew to sign up in the summer of 2007			2
his brother is also serving with famous @entity148 regiment in @entity149			0
despite the relatively small numbers of @entity7 in the @entity3 , they make a large contingent of the rugby squad and for @entity5 it 's almost a home from home , and allows him to use his native tongue in private moments			1
role model @entity5 is following in the footsteps of @entity159 , who also represented the @entity3 before playing in @entity161 's top flight with @entity162 and @entity163			1
" watching him playing @entity46 rugby , i thought one day i 'll be doing the same thing but , i never realized it 's going to be that soon , " @entity5 said			1
" when i got the call from @entity45 coach @entity169 i was overwhelmed , to be honest			2
i thought it was a joke and hung up on him ! " but @entity172 was deadly serious and set about transforming @entity5 's raw talent into the finished product after an inauspicious start			2
" on the first day of training , my passing was absolutely ridiculous , i mean i could n't even pass on my left - hand side , " he recalled			0
" to get up to that level you have to work extra hard , it 's the only way you can improve yourself , the extra time you put in , the extra effort you put into the game or into the training			0
" but if there is one thing that the @entity3 has instilled in @entity190 it is discipline : " you have to dress up correctly , be punctual at all times , uniforms ironed			0
" it was a culture shock after his self - confessed " easy life " back home -- where he admits a love for the local alcohol kava resulted in him getting a gold tooth after coming off second best in a drunken fight			2
" punctuality , shaving and haircuts , i just did n't care about that stuff ... everything has changed a lot , " he laughed			0
like @entity159 , who has been a star of @entity7 's world renowned seven - a - side team , @entity5 is also an expert of that version of rugby which relies more on speed and agility than the traditional 15 - a - side game			1
@entity214 will take its place in the @entity216 for the first time at @entity218 and @entity5 , who is already being tipped to have an international future , could be left with a dilemma			2
" i 'm not too sure whether it 's @entity161 or @entity7 , " he said , while admitting he still thinks of @entity222 , the capital city of @entity7 as " home " -- particularly at christmas time when he longs for the warm weather rather than the @entity139 rain and chill			0
his wife and son are also back in @entity7 with his parents until he can arrange for their travel visa			0
soldiers supported fame and no little fortune may await rokoduguni but his thoughts are always with his fellow servicemen and women who are risking their lives in @entity25			0
" i was man of the match against @entity240 ( scoring two tries on his debut in november ) and as soon as they announced my name i was thinking of them straight away , " he said			0
" i dedicated the win to them to let them know that even though i 'm back here , all my support is with them out there			0
" @entity5 pays regular visits to the rehabilitation unit at @entity255 , south of @entity256 , where severely injured combatants are treated			0
a @entity7 comrade is currently recovering there , and @entity5 made him a promise ahead of the latest @entity92			1
" i asked the doctors and nurses to make sure that they got him a television so that he could watch this game and i said that if i scored a try that i would do a backflip for him , which is what i did			0
" meanwhile , back home in @entity7 , @entity5 's proud parents are keeping up to date with his progress by watching @entity273 clips of his try - scoring exploits			1
judging by his rapid rise to the top they will be glued to the worldwide web for many years to come as @entity5 terrorizes rugby defenses with his blistering pace and stockily built 94 kg frame			1
but he knows that at any time the call might come to join his regiment on a tour of duty in @entity25 or another area of conflict where @entity139 troops will be deployed , and his sporting ambitions would have to be placed on hold .			1
