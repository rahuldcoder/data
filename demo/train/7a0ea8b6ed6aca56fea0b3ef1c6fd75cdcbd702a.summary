@entity0 , @entity1 -- the political crisis that has gripped @entity4 for nearly a year may be drawing to an end , but a deadly cholera outbreak there is only getting worse			1
@entity4 walk through mounds of garbage			1
lack of sanitation and clean water make cholera spread			1
the newly formed cabinet of @entity4 's unity government met for the first time tuesday , the same day that @entity17 ( @entity17 ) released a report warning that the epidemic shows no signs of slowing			1
the outbreak -- one of the world 's largest , according to the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) -- is only getting worse , and could be a stepping - stone to other epidemics and health crises , international agencies say			1
since august , at least 3,623 people have died and 76,127 people have been infected by cholera , a preventable water - borne bacterial illness that causes severe diarrhea , vomiting and dehydration and can lead to death in a matter of days if not treated			1
according to a report released tuesday by @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , new cholera patients were being registered at a rate of one every minute at the beginning of february in @entity4			1
unless urgent action is taken , the aid group said , the country could see a worsening of the " massive medical emergency that is spiraling out of control , " @entity17 president dr. @entity43 told @entity2 tuesday after his latest visit to @entity4			1
@entity17 says the response from the international community to the crisis has been slow and inadequate , and it called on donors to put aside politics and send help immediately			0
the cholera epidemic has been left to fester as the @entity4 government grappled with questionable elections , opposition charges of fraud , power - sharing talks and the creation of a unity government in the last year			1
during that time , the country 's economy and infrastructure imploded , with sanitation systems and garbage collection becoming virtually non-existent			2
" the reasons for the ( cholera ) outbreak are clear : lack of access to clean water , burst and blocked sewage systems , and uncollected refuse overflowing in the streets , all clear symptoms of the breakdown in infrastructure resulting from @entity4 's political and economic meltdown , " the @entity17 report said			1
the disease is contracted " by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium , " the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) said on its web site			1
" in an epidemic , the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person , " the @entity83 said			0
" the disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water			2
" making matters worse , flooding from the rainy season -- which began in november -- is spreading the bacteria through swollen streams and rivers			0
cholera cases have now been reported in all of the country 's provinces , the @entity17 report said			2
exacerbating the epidemic is the current economic crisis , which has caused the health care system to nearly grind to a halt			2
" i 've seen many health services being down like this in my life as an @entity17 doctor , but only in this country have i seen this kind of collapse of the public health care system in the absence of any conflict , " @entity43 said			0
he said most of the country 's public hospitals or clinics are either closed or empty , and the ones that are open face critical shortages of drugs and medical equipment			0
" a huge part of the medical staff is not showing up because they are unpaid and on top of that , the patients , when finally accessing one opened facility , are asked for totally indecent amounts of money only to be seen and then an extra amount of money for their treatment , " @entity43 added			0
many patients ca n't afford to pay and do n't even bother to seek treatment , he said			0
@entity17 believes cholera may be just the beginning of a nightmare health crisis in the southern @entity144 country			2
" the current food shortages make us fear of further malnutrition among the most vulnerable , starting with the under ( age ) five children , where any kind of infectious epidemic can start at any moment after this current cholera epidemic , " @entity43 explained			2
@entity17 currently has more than 500 staff members working in @entity4 to battle the outbreak			0
the organization is calling on the government to remove barriers that are slowing the @entity17 response to the crisis			0
" despite the glaring humanitarian needs , the government of @entity4 continues to exert rigid control over aid organizations			2
@entity17 faces restrictions in implementing medical assessments and interventions , " the group 's report said			0
" the @entity4 government must facilitate independent assessments of need , guarantee that aid agencies can work wherever needs are identified and ease bureaucratic restrictions so that programs can be staffed properly and drugs procured quickly , " the report said			1
@entity180 , the chief of @entity17 's mission in @entity4 , said the cost of importing medicine is often higher than the cost of the drugs themselves			0
high fees for visas and work permits for staff are also impeding operations , he said			0
and it often takes months to get permission for @entity17 specialists to operate inside the country , @entity180 explained , with some eventually being turned down .			0

doctors without @entity199 report says cholera crisis shows no signs of slowing
aid agencies say it could be lead to other epidemics and health crises
no sanitation or clean water , piles of garbage help spread disease
epidemic has been left to fester *due* to @entity4 political *wrangling*
