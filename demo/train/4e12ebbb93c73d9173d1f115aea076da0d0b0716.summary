-- i once told my mother about a girl i had a crush on			1
at the time , i think i was about 16 , and i had so much acne that if i fell asleep at a library , when i woke up , a blind guy would be trying to read my face			2
" just go for her , " my mother said			2
" it 's not that simple , " i said , while filling out my order form for 25 crates of @entity13			2
" she 's got a boyfriend			0
" " well , do n't do anything differently			0
act like she does n't			0
that 's how i got your father			0
" she then walked out of the room , leaving my pasty teenage complexion an extra shade of white as i actually contemplated my mother dating			0
i 've since related this story as an example of how hitting on someone with a significant other is n't always a terrible thing			1
hey , if they 're not married or serious , go for it			0
however , if you 're considering trying to get a guy who has a girlfriend , there are a few things you should know			1
the @entity0 : the @entity41 online dating do 's and don'ts for guys first , i 'll admit guys will hit on anything			1
i once observed one of my friends hitting on a street sign			1
granted , he was drunk , but it did not matter to him that he was hitting on an inanimate object , or that the street sign was a little out of his league			1
men do have standards , but when they 're single , they 'll hit on a woman with a boyfriend			1
they 'll hit on nuns			1
very occasionally , they 'll hit on nuns with boyfriends			2
i 'm not going to defame my own kind , but women can be better at subtlety , and you should use this to your advantage			0
the @entity0 : is cheating worse when you 're married ? i 'm a big anti-cheating guy , so if a woman hit on me while i had a girlfriend , i 'd be flattered			1
if she offered to go home with me or tried to kiss me or something like that , milk would shoot out of my nose and i 'd run for the hills			0
( i have an odd fight - or - flight mechanism			0
) subtlety is your friend			0
we 'll pick up on the signals			0
if a guy is interested , wait for him to honorably break up with his girlfriend before the two of you start dating			2
frankly , this is just good manners			0
the @entity0 : to tell or not to tell on a cheater ? it should go without saying that it 's bad form to hit on a guy while his girlfriend is actually there , or even if she 's in the same town			1
men have a well - honed sense of panic that kicks in when someone 's hitting on them while their girlfriends are in the same zip code			2
we know that women can read us , so unless you 're hitting on a really shady guy , you 'll scare him off as he runs home to call his girl and tell the story of the @entity110			1
the @entity0 : can couples get past infidelity ? one last thing : if you do snag a guy away from his girlfriend , be wary			1
the good news is that , despite the popular perception , most of us men tend to be loyal once we 're in a committed relationship			0
but know that if it happened once , it can happen again			2

***writer*** : some guys will hit on anything -- even inanimate objects
***writer*** : hitting on a man when his girlfriend is *nearby* could make you " @entity110 "
if you snag him away from someone , be wary : it could happen again , ***writer*** says
