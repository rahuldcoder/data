@entity0 is going through its greatest upheaval since protests erupted during the @entity3 more than three years ago			2
only this time , it 's not a cry for democracy but a bitter sectarian battle for power -- pitching @entity9 and other @entity11 groups against @entity13 rebels			1
the @entity13 -- whose stronghold is northern @entity0 -- swept into the capital , @entity17 , a month ago , where they met little opposition			1
since then , they 've taken control of @entity0 's second port , @entity21 , on the @entity22			2
now they 're trying to challenge @entity24 ( @entity24 ) in its heartland in central @entity0			0
hundreds of @entity13 fighters converged on the provinces of @entity29 and @entity30 in recent days			0
@entity0 @entity32 officials tell @entity33 @entity34 have taken heavy casualties because of roadside bombs planted by @entity24			1
" houthis are used to military clashes , while @entity9 uses guerrilla tactics against its enemies , " said @entity37 , president of the @entity38 in @entity17			1
officials estimate that at least 75 people have been killed in fighting since saturday , the great majority of them @entity34 -- including 22 killed by a roadside bomb monday in the town of @entity48			0
there were further clashes in the town tuesday , with @entity24 claiming it inflicted heavy casualties on @entity13 fighters			0
@entity24 has taken control of the town of @entity54 in neighboring @entity29 province , as @entity0 threatens -- again -- to become a patchwork of rival fiefdoms where the central government has little influence			1
@entity9 claims that some @entity11 tribes have joined it in repelling the @entity34 incursions			2
writing in @entity63 , commentator @entity62 says @entity24 is " forging political alliances with tribes that view the @entity34 as enemies ... indeed , the organization has expanded to new areas in response to @entity13 control			1
" @entity71 , a senior figure in @entity24 , said the group will confront the @entity34 ' advance , in what appears to be a new front in the larger @entity11 struggle across the @entity78			2
the @entity34 have long complained that they have been marginalized and persecuted by @entity0 's @entity11 majority , and have been involved in series of rebellions since 2004			2
but never before have they taken so much territory across such a wide area of central and northern @entity0			0
they are demanding a substantial presence in a new government and a voice in the writing of a new constitution			0
after taking control of ministries , the state television headquarters and other government facilities in @entity17 last month , @entity13 leaders signed a peace agreement with president @entity96			1
but their presence has sparked protests among hardline @entity11 parties and groups and has given @entity9 a new rallying call			0
@entity102 says the agreement tried " to legitimize the fall of the capital and cover the truth on the ground , which is the collapse of the @entity0 state and its replacement by militia forces taking control of its streets and expanding militarily to the rest of the country 's provinces			1
" adding to an increasingly volatile situation , a secessionist movement in the south of @entity0 , @entity118 , is stepping up protests in @entity121 , @entity0 's chief port and the largest city in the south			0
@entity9 resurgent in @entity0 amid political turmoil for @entity130 , @entity0 's descent into a conflict of many groups -- whose alliances can change quickly and unpredictably -- is the worst - case scenario			1
for @entity9 , it is fertile ground			0
in some ways , events in @entity0 , with outside powers all jockeying for advantage , are beginning to mirror the disintegration of @entity139 .			0

@entity13 rebels battle @entity9 - linked group for territory in @entity0
@entity34 took over some ministries in @entity17 last month , demanding role in government
