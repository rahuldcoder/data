when 33 - year - old @entity1 visits the supermarket it 's rarely for stocking up his fridge for the week			1
as head of a cow protection enforcement team , he regularly scours @entity7 grocery stores and outdoor markets for food products containing cow beef			0
for the last 15 years , @entity1 and his team of 120 @entity7 - based volunteers have thrown themselves in a battle that pits @entity15 's billon - dollar meat industry and growing underground beef trade against @entity18 traditionalists keen on preserving the holy status of cows			1
" the cow is our mother , it 's our duty to protect her , " said @entity1 , who monitors and raids hundreds of stores , butcher shops and slaughterhouses suspected of carrying , selling or slaughtering @entity15 's blessed bovines			1
" we do this because we believe in what the cow represents in our country , our culture and in the @entity18 religion			2
" this year , @entity15 will displace the @entity36 as the world 's third largest beef exporter , behind @entity39 and @entity40			1
in just the first half of 2012 , @entity15 exported $ 1.24 billion worth of meat , and a 30 percent growth in revenue from 2010 exports is projected by the end of the year , according to a @entity36 @entity48 study			2
while the bulk of @entity15 exports is buffalo meat bound for @entity52 and @entity54 markets , the growing middle class in @entity57 countries has sparked a new craving for cow beef			2
the rise in demand could make @entity15 the world 's king beef exporter by 2013 , according to @entity65 estimates			1
but as @entity15 continues its struggle for economic and political dominance in @entity69 , there is concern that @entity18 - mandated bans on beef could hamper the industry 's future growth , particularly in states like @entity76 and @entity77 where the practice is legal			1
relied on by generations of @entity15 for tilling fields , dairy products and dung fuel , the cow is regarded by @entity18 as gau mata , or maternal figure , and has had a long - standing central role in @entity15 's religious rituals			1
those religious attitudes , however , are viewed by some @entity15 business leaders as a major hindrance to commerce			0
" @entity97 beef could be a very lucrative business in @entity15 , " said dr. @entity91 , the director of @entity92 , who believes that religious attitudes may stand to change once the extent of business opportunities are realized			2
" i think five - to - 10 years from now , people wo n't be so scandalized by the sale of cow beef			0
" the majority of @entity15 's 24 states outlaw the slaughter of cows except under extenuating circumstances : to stifle contagious diseases , prevent pain and suffering , medical research , etc. and several states -- including @entity7 and @entity111 , among others -- ban the sale and slaughter of cows altogether			1
the strict laws against cow slaughter in the majority of @entity15 's provinces have forced the lucrative cow beef trade underground			1
an estimated 1.5 million cows , valued at up to $ 500 million , are smuggled out of @entity15 annually , which some analysts say provide more than 50 % of beef consumed in neighboring @entity124			2
" when you consider just how much money is made from underground cow smuggling , it becomes clear that not only is there a huge amount at stake , but a huge demand that butchers and slaughterhouses are catering to , " said dr. @entity132 , a fellow at the @entity137 in @entity7 , who has extensively studied the work and trade among @entity15 's butcher communities			1
working with @entity143 's enforcement team is @entity144 , a cow - advocacy lawyer who works from a home - office on the outskirts of @entity7			0
throughout the day , @entity144 fields a stream of phone calls -- tipsters who have caught wind of illegal slaughterhouses and owners of gau shalas , or cow sanctuaries , concerned with unexpected expenses associated with new rescues			0
in @entity144 's office hangs a painting of @entity159 — one of the most revered divinities in @entity162 — with his arm resting affectionately on a white calf			0
while @entity1 's crew breaks up the slaughterhouses , @entity165 builds a legal case for prosecution			0
his backlog of casework extensive , @entity144 says			0
while there might be money to be made from adding cow beef to current exports , @entity15 would incur costs elsewhere , @entity144 says			2
" cows have long been the source of fuel , manure and fertilizer , among other things			0
these animals are revered because they 've played a large role in the welfare and livelihood of all @entity15 , " @entity144 said			0
" take away the cow and the repercussions will be huge			0
