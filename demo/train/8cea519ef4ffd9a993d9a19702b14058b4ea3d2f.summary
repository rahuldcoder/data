-- as a historian and a former speaker of the house who negotiated successfully through two government shutdowns , a successful welfare reform bill , the first tax cut in 16 years and four balanced budgets , i am offended and a little frightened by president @entity9 's deliberate dishonesty about the debt ceiling			1
on wednesday , speaking to the @entity11 , @entity9 said : " you have never seen in the history of the @entity14 the debt ceiling or the threat of not raising the debt being used to extort a president or a governing party and trying to force issues that have nothing to do with the budget and nothing to do with the debt			1
" this is just plain false , and he knows it			0
that he would say something so factually false in a prepared text is very worrisome			0
first of all , issues such as @entity32 do n't have " nothing to do with the budget " and the idea that it is unusual for @entity37 to bring them into the debt ceiling debate is absurd			1
far from having " nothing to do with the budget and nothing to do with the debt , " @entity32 is a major part of the budget , and it is now projected to cost twice what the president promised			1
the president 's historical claim is completely wrong , as well			2
let 's set the record straight			0
debt ceilings have been used since president @entity49 in the 1950s to enable conservatives to put limits on government spending			0
the concept of using the debt ceiling as a vehicle to force negotiations really took off under president @entity57 in the early 1970s			2
under president @entity58 , one of the most important changes in spending , the @entity61 , was attached to a debt ceiling provision			0
presidents @entity63 and @entity65 also signed debt limit increases tied to spending agreements			1
when we reached a deal to balance the budget 1997 , it included a debt limit increase			1
as speaker @entity77 pointed out , " in fact , every major effort to deal with the deficit over the past 30 years has been tied to the debt limit			1
" of course , @entity9 himself has signed a debt ceiling increase with amendments attached to it			2
this is not a dictatorship			0
the president can not dictate			0
the structure of our @entity86 requires negotiations between the president and the @entity37 to get anything done			1
it is very troubling that the president would adopt a " no - negotiation " strategy and then deceive the @entity14 people about the history of negotiations on the debt ceiling			2
it is especially bizarre that @entity9 eagerly negotiates with @entity101 president @entity100 and @entity103 dictator @entity102 but considers the elected leaders of the @entity37 unworthy negotiators			1
as @entity58 said in his 1964 speech " @entity107 " : " the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they 're ignorant ; it 's just that they know so much that is n't so			0
" anyone who tells you tying the debt ceiling increase to spending agreements is unprecedented knows something that just is n't so			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity120 .			0

@entity120 says @entity9 wrongly claims debt limit has n't been subject to negotiations
he says president is wrong in saying @entity32 is n't *relevant* to the budget
@entity129 says there 's long history of presidents negotiating with @entity37 on debt limit
@entity129 : if @entity9 can negotiate with @entity100 and @entity102 , he should negotiate with @entity37
