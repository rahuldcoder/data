-- the accelerating pace of the slaughter of elephants for their tusks has put @entity6 elephants at catastrophic risk in the coming decades			1
to make matters worse , some of the region 's most notorious armed groups are taking tusks to finance their atrocities			1
the @entity15 terrorists of @entity16 , the @entity19 government - supported janjaweed militia that has been responsible for much of the violence during the @entity22 genocide , and the @entity23 , which has kidnapped hundreds of boys and girls across @entity26 to be fighters and sex slaves , are participating in this illegal trade			2
these groups typically kill elephants using the automatic weapons that they also use to kill people			1
and as the militants become more involved in the poaching business , they apply the same lack of discrimination in killing elephants that they have demonstrated with their human victims			1
for example , poachers thought to be janjaweed from @entity45 , working with @entity46 , allegedly killed at least 86 elephants , including calves and 33 pregnant females , over the course of a week			2
the @entity51 found that at least 400 elephants were slaughtered between january and march 2012 at the @entity53 in @entity54			0
animal rights groups say poaching is worse than it 's been in decades			1
they say it may be even worse than it was in the 1980s , before the international ban on ivory was put in place			0
watch : fighting the @entity23 slaughter of elephants typically , the elephants are killed only for their tusks			1
poachers often hack off their trunks first and then their tusks with hacksaws and machetes , and leave the bodies to rot			0
some @entity23 groups have reportedly eaten the meat of some of the elephants they have killed , which is not surprising given their frequent hand - to - mouth existence in the bush			2
this appalling reality presents an opportunity for conservation groups and anti-atrocity and human rights groups to join forces to combat the threat posed to people and elephants by these armed groups			1
@entity88 , @entity90 undersecretary general and the @entity92 's executive director , said , " the surge in the killing of elephants in @entity26 and the illegal taking of other listed species globally threatens not only wildlife populations but the livelihoods of millions who depend on tourism for a living and the lives of those wardens and wildlife staff who are attempting to stem the illegal tide			1
" according to a report released in march 2013 by @entity92 , 17,000 elephants in monitored reserves were killed in 2011			2
the toll climbed in 2012			0
the number of elephants killed for their tusks has exploded in recent years because of high prices from rising global demand for ivory , particularly in @entity119 and @entity120			1
the pace of killing outstrips wild elephants ' natural reproductive replacement rate			1
armed groups take advantage of the increasing value of ivory to fund their atrocities			1
their fighters have the training and weapons to kill large numbers of elephants and trade their tusks for arms , ammunition and food			2
the @entity138 and the @entity139 recently released a report focused on the @entity23 's poaching of elephant tusks in the @entity144 's @entity143			0
the @entity23 , whose leader @entity145 is the subject of an arrest warrant from the @entity149 for war crimes and crimes against humanity , has for decades terrorized the people of @entity26			0
other groups , such as @entity16 and the janjaweed , seem to have made similar calculations			0
@entity159 poaching for profit by armed groups is not new			0
in the 1970s , according to @entity164 researcher @entity163 , the @entity6 military partly funded its support of white @entity167 forces fighting @entity6 rebel groups through revenue from the killing of elephants in @entity167 , which was then legal			2
rebels in @entity173 and @entity174 , also supported by @entity6 , took tusks and sold them through @entity6			0
both poaching and armed groups such as the @entity23 arise from a vacuum of governance			0
indeed , the @entity181 correspondent @entity180 and others say that members of the armed forces of the @entity144 , @entity45 , @entity19 and @entity185 have participated in the illegal ivory trade as well			0
only effective local , national , and transnational action can stop this horror			0
anti-atrocity groups such as the @entity138 can advocate for actions to shut off the demand for ivory in @entity193			1
conservation groups could broaden their focus to include efforts to end wars that have created a symbiotic relationship between ivory poaching and civilian suffering			1
both types of organizations should emphasize the longer - term requirement for effective governance to lessen the likelihood of war and ivory poaching			0
@entity207 and parallel action could tap activist organizations , increase the pressure on policymakers for action and broaden the knowledge about both of these problems among those who previously had focused on only one			0
the combined efforts of conservation and human rights groups could spur the efforts of governments and international organizations to slow the destruction of the @entity6 elephant and free the people of east and central @entity26 from the threat of @entity145 and his ilk			1
this could be the start of a beautiful friendship , one that could help stop the massacre of both humans and animals in @entity26			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			0

number of elephants killed for tusks is rising as demand for ivory soars , especially in @entity193
@entity239 : @entity26 's militant groups kill elephants for tusks to fund their atrocities
@entity239 : *future* grim as the pace of killing outstrips *ability* to replace deaths with births
human rights and conservation groups , he says , should combine efforts to stop suffering
