-- vice president @entity1 was sworn in friday as acting president of @entity3 in a ceremony held in the @entity5 in @entity6 , three days after the death of president @entity8			1
asked if he swore to uphold the laws of the country and to follow the constitution , @entity1 said , " i swear			1
" then , in a rambling speech that evoked the bombastic oratory of @entity8 , @entity1 said he would work to keep alive his memory and legacy			1
" we still have him in our hearts , " said @entity1 , who was wearing a sash bearing the colors of the @entity3 flag across his chest			1
" i have him here , here , as if he was the name in my soul , because i am his son			2
" he continued , " we are here to guarantee peace , safety and political stability and the lifting up of the poor in @entity3 will continue			2
onward and upward with socialism ! " @entity1 appealed to the opposition to field a presidential candidate for elections that are to be held in 30 days			1
" some of them are here today , " he said			2
" but he noted that few opposition members were in attendance			2
" they did n't want to come , " he said			2
about the elections , he said , " may the best person win			0
" @entity1 alluded to the @entity41 , with whom @entity8 had had prickly relations			1
" our eyes will see sooner rather than later the decline of the imperialist elites that changed the @entity41 into an empire of aggression , " he said			0
" that moment will be a fabulous moment for humanity			0
" he announced that he had appointed the minister of science and technology , @entity53 , to replace him as vice president			0
shortly before the ceremony , opposition leader and @entity58 gov. @entity57 told reporters in @entity6 that the ceremony was " an abuse of power			1
" " to be president , the people have to elect you , " he said			0
" the constitution is very clear			0
" @entity57 said @entity1 would have to first register as a candidate and then campaign			1
" that 's what the constitution says , " he said			0
" it 's all here			0
" then , addressing @entity1 as if he were there , he said , " @entity1 , they did n't elect you			1
the people did n't vote for you , boy			0
" he continued , " we are not going to permit that the sorrow that the people feel be an excuse for the abuse of power , for constitutional fraud			2
" @entity8 's impact lauded at funeral he called the ceremony " an illegitimate swearing - in " and blasted a high court decision declaring it legal			1
" gentlemen of the @entity85 , you do not decide who is and who is not president , " he said			0
" the people decide ... the vice president takes charge , but not as interim president			0
" asked whether he planned to run for president , @entity57 demurred			1
" we will talk again , " he said			2
the opposition was arguing that @entity1 should have served both as interim president , without being sworn in , and vice president , said @entity99 , director of the @entity100 at the @entity101 and professor of political science at @entity104			1
" but now that he 's named a vice president and has the presidential flag , we 'll have to see what they do about participating in the election , " she said			2
" a constitution can not specify every single scenario that could occur , " she continued			0
" that 's part of the problem			0
" she predicted that @entity8 's primary legacy would be the sense of inclusion that he gave to those sectors of the population that had not felt represented in the past			1
" i think it 's a very strong legacy and that they do feel like now they 've got rights and that they will exercise those rights in the future			0
" but he also leaves a divided country , a move that was intentional , she said			0
" he felt that change could only be accomplished through confrontation , " she said			0
" and that confrontation included excluding those who used to be in power			2
" the result has been a loss of much of the country 's production capacity , both in the private sector and in the petroleum sector , where a number of workers and managers were fired after a strike in 2003 , she said			0
@entity144 , president of the @entity145 , a @entity147 - based policy forum on @entity149 affairs , predicted that a @entity1 administration would find it tough to govern			1
" @entity8 had a unique ability to do that , and nobody else has either the political skill or the charisma to keep all the very disparate factions of chavismo together			1
" still , @entity1 and his supporters have great incentive to rise to the occasion			1
" if they do n't , they risk losing power , and they want to stay in power , " he said			1
but even if he wins a six - year term as president , @entity1 would not be on solid ground , given the country 's profound economic and security problems , @entity144 said			1
he cited inflation above 22 % , massive debt , shortages of basic goods , routine electricity blackouts and widespread crime -- the 16,000 people killed in an average year is triple the number who were killed the year @entity8 entered office			1
" the fundamental problem is that the government has just spent much more money than they had			0
" @entity144 also predicted that a @entity1 administration would not maintain warm relations with the @entity41			2
neither country has posted an ambassador in the other country since 2008			0
" @entity1 has to be very careful about the base of his party and following @entity8 's policy toward the @entity41 , which has been one of a lot of confrontation and aggression			1
" still , he noted , @entity1 is a former union official , not the paratrooper military officer that @entity8 was			1
" so , he 's somebody who has negotiated deals			0
i think he 'd be open to at least having communication with the @entity41			0
" @entity0 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			0
