a compromise federal budget plan that would remove the threat of a government shutdown for two years won easy approval thursday from the @entity5 - controlled @entity4			1
the deal worked out by @entity8 chairman rep. @entity7 and @entity10 chairwoman @entity9 passed on a 332 - 94 vote and now goes to the @entity12 - led @entity10 , which is expected to approve it next week in a very close vote			1
it represented rare convergence between the two parties on government spending after two years of bitter debate and political brinksmanship that included the 16 - day shutdown in october			0
a @entity23 statement said the measure does not include everything president @entity26 called for , but " it marks an important moment of bipartisan cooperation and shows @entity30 can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done			0
" public anger over the @entity30 dysfunction , especially with conservative republicans who triggered the shutdown by trying to link federal spending to their efforts to dismantle @entity39 , motivated @entity5 leaders to shrug off far right opposition to the budget compromise			1
a small step house speaker @entity44 acknowledged the measure amounted to only a small step toward the @entity5 goal of deficit reduction and balancing the budget , but he rejected opposition by some conservatives in his caucus as well as outside groups on the political right			1
" is it perfect ? does it go far enough ? no , not at all , " @entity44 said in urging his colleagues to back the plan , noting it resulted from " doing what the @entity61 people expect us to do -- coming together and finding common ground			1
" @entity7 noted that @entity30 politicians have " been at each other 's throats for a long time " over budget issues , and @entity5 must first win some elections in order to get all the deficit reduction and spending cuts they want			1
@entity74 also hailed the budget proposal as a " small positive step forward , " in the words of rep. @entity78 of @entity79			2
he and other @entity74 called for @entity80 to also extend long - term unemployment benefits for more than 1 million @entity61 set to expire after @entity82 , but their support for the budget plan showed they dropped any demand to link the issues in thursday 's vote			1
in the @entity4 vote , 169 @entity5 voted for the spending plan while 62 opposed it , with 163 democrats in favor and 32 against			1
while most @entity5 supported the plan , @entity44 needed help from @entity74 to get the 217 - vote threshold needed for passage			1
@entity10 aides said they expect the budget to pass the @entity10 but it could be by a razor thin margin			1
this could also change if momentum against the bill grows			0
@entity5 conservatives including @entity106 of @entity107 , @entity108 of @entity109 and @entity110 of @entity111 , said they will oppose the measure , which would need some @entity5 support for @entity74 to overcome an expected filibuster			2
" the new budget deal moves in the wrong direction : it spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for @entity39 , " @entity106 said			2
" i can not support it			0
" @entity110 and @entity108 said they opposed cuts to pension benefits for some military veterans under the spending plan			2
escalated criticism @entity44 earlier escalated his criticism of such opposition from conservative colleagues and outside groups in a rare public display of a longstanding rift between the @entity5 tea party wing and less extreme establishment @entity5			1
to @entity44 , groups such as @entity136 lost credibility by rejecting the plan before it was announced , he told reporters			1
he also blamed the influential outside groups for pushing @entity5 legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in october			0
" the day before the government re-opened , one of these groups stood up and said ' well , we never really thought it would work , ' " he told reporters before animatedly asking : " are you kidding me ? " the agreement reached by @entity151 of @entity30 would extend government spending into 2015 to remove the threat of another shutdown before next year 's congressional elections			0
it sets government spending at $ 1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year that runs through september , and $ 1.014 trillion			0
overall , it proposes to save $ 85 billion and would reduce the deficit by more than $ 20 billion			0
conservative complaints some conservatives complain the total is more than the level called for in the @entity164 that followed brinksmanship negotiations two years ago over raising the federal borrowing limit			0
that 2011 deal imposed unpopular forced spending cuts known as sequestration on the military and other government programs			2
the new compromise would eliminate $ 45 billion from the next round of the sequester cuts that are set to hit in january , as well as another $ 18 billion scheduled for 2015			1
@entity44 noted it achieves more deficit reduction than the @entity164 , asserting it adhered to conservative principles of shrinking government and federal debt			1
" i 'm as conservative as anybody around this place , " he said in defending his attacks on the outside groups , adding that " all the things we 've done in the three years i 've been speaker have not violated any conservative principles , not once			2
" asked why he spoke out now against the outside groups , @entity44 said they crossed a line , adding that " when you criticize something and you have no idea what you 're criticizing , it undermines your credibility			2
" @entity23 support the @entity23 supports the compromise , but factions on both sides still pushed for change as the issue moved closer to decisive votes			0
@entity74 insist the budget plan should extend long - term unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year			1
however , senate majority leader @entity207 has said the issue would be considered separately in 2014			0
@entity23 spokesman @entity209 said @entity80 should take up the unemployment insurance extension but did not insist that it be part of the budget package			0
" we want them both and we think @entity80 ought to pass them both , " @entity209 said			0
defense secretary @entity216 praised the agreement thursday , saying provided certainty for military planning after the harmful sequester cuts and constant showdowns over spending			1
" this agreement does not solve all ( @entity225 ) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training , in particular , and procurement , " @entity223 said			0
however , right - wing groups escalated their criticism of the plan			2
" @entity235 , @entity80 has claimed that cost - saving measures were permanent , only to later renege on these promises , " said @entity233 , national coordinator of @entity234			0
she took particular aim at @entity5 leaders such as @entity44 , saying the deal " also exposes the true colors of several in the @entity5 establishment when it comes to protecting conservative principles			1
" diminishing influence ? @entity44 's comments to reporters were aimed at some of the same organizations that have effectively pressured @entity4 @entity5 to resist compromising on budget issues in the past two years			1
they include @entity136 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and the @entity256 brothers , @entity5 campaign financiers			0
he made similar comments questioning the motives of some of the groups at a closed - door meeting this week with @entity4 republicans			1
the speaker told members that " no one controls your voting card but you , " according to a @entity5 source in the meeting			0
strong @entity5 backing for the budget compromise showed that conservatives and the outside groups that back them have diminished influence			2
rep. @entity277 , a conservative from @entity279 , said outside groups wo n't be able to sway as many conservatives because legislators like the idea of returning @entity80 to what 's known as regular order -- deliberating and passing bills the way they 're supposed to be done , instead of backroom deals reached amid crises			2
however , @entity5 rep @entity291 of @entity292 , a critic of the budget plan , wondered what had changed among fellow republicans who now rejected the thinking of the outside conservative groups			1
keeping score the conservative groups keep scorecards on the voting records of legislators and back candidates who follow their policy stances with key campaign contributions			1
such support can carry enhanced influence with congressional elections coming up next year			0
@entity308 , a spokesman for @entity254 , did n't back down from his criticism of the budget deal			0
" over the next few days , lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents , many of whom are our members , what they 've achieved by increasing spending , increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken			0
that will be a really tough sell back home , " @entity308 said in a statement to @entity322			0
fresh partisan warfare in the @entity10 dems want jobless benefits			0
