this fall she returns to television as publishing exec @entity29 on @entity31 's @entity30			2
with a wavy bob ( thanks to a grown - out perm ) , @entity2 , 38 , embraces her girlier side			1
" when my hair was longer , people did n't come up and talk to me , " she says			1

" what 's your earliest beauty memory ? i used to watch my mom put makeup on , and we would go to the five - and - dime store and experiment with whatever makeup was there			2

do you always carry around two different eye liners ? yes			0
the liquid liner is for above the eye , and the pencil is for inside the eye			0

you sound very low maintenance			0
do you have any beauty indulgences ? i splurge on acupuncture			1
it 's preventative medicine : you go in once a month , and you get a little checkup so you 're regulated			0
my parents used to get acupuncture			1
it has been a part of my culture and my life for a long time , and it really , really works			1
it can help you lose weight , it can help your skin stay young -- and i 've found it helps with jet lag			1
[ acupuncturists ] look at your tongue and will say : " all right , you 're drinking too much " or " you 're emotional , are n't you ? " how else do you stay healthy ? do you still practice martial arts ? i just trained for the movies			1
but i love going hiking , and now because i 'm [ filming in @entity127 ] , i go biking			0
people can see me on the street -- i 'm not biking that fast			0
it 's just good exercise , and you get around quickly			1
it 's like being on a horse or a motorcycle because you 're outside			0
what about @entity139 ? i 've heard you 're obsessed			0
i use it for everything			0
it 's not too glossy , so i wear it when i do movies because it looks really natural			0

and if i fall , which i do a lot -- i generally skid -- i 'll put it on my [ scrapes ]			0
