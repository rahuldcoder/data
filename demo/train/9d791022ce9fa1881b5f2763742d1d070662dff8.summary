@entity0 -- a librarian in northern @entity3 made what may be the discovery of his lifetime when he uncovered a rare @entity8 's @entity7 in his library 's collection			1
there are fewer than 240 known copies of the @entity7 -- the first printed collection of 36 of william shakespeare 's plays , produced in 1623 , seven years after his death -- so turning up a new one is an unlikely event			1
for @entity20 , director of the medieval and early modern collection at the library in @entity24 , the moment he realized what he held in his hands was one of excitement -- and disbelief			1
he was preparing an exhibition on @entity33 authors in september when he came across the @entity7			2
it was missing some pages , which is why it had been misfiled many decades ago			1
" we looked deeper and we realized quickly that it was not a common edition , " @entity20 told @entity1			0
at first , the director could not believe what he had found			0
" i think i have 2.5 million pounds in my hands , " he told his boss			0
he then sought advice from @entity45 , a @entity8 expert at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
" i am not an expert myself on @entity8 's pieces , so i wanted to have the opinion of an expert , " said @entity20			1
" this is why i contacted @entity45 to make sure they did not already know about the @entity7			2
he was actually in @entity54 working on the @entity8 year at the @entity55 and agreed to come to authenticate the document			0
" @entity45 's authentication , just this past weekend , confirmed what @entity20 had suspected			0
the @entity24 library was home to a @entity8 's @entity7			1
this discovery " will add prestige to the region and help reconnect with our illustrious history , unfortunately forgotten for a century and a half , " @entity20 said			0
the library still plans to make the @entity7 part of the @entity33 exhibition , but it will not be put on display			2
" it is going to be digitized to be accessible to the public , at least virtually , " @entity20 said			0
the precious book , meanwhile , will be stored in a safe to protect it from any damage			0
according to the @entity55 , which holds four copies , the @entity7 was produced by two of @entity8 's fellow actors and closest friends , @entity76 and @entity79			1
although some of the playwright 's works had been published before in a smaller , poorly edited format , the roughly 900 - page book was the first to unite almost all of them , categorized as " @entity87			0
" without the @entity7 , much of @entity8 's work would have been lost to subsequent generations			1
the @entity90 in @entity91 , with 82 @entity92 , has the single largest collection of the books , representing one - third of the world 's existing copies			0
@entity8 turns 450 this year @entity1 's @entity97 reported from @entity0 , and @entity98 wrote and reported in @entity54 .			2
