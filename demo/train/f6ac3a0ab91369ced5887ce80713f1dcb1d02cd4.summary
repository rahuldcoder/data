-- @entity2 's latest refresher claims to fend off fat			1
but is a healthy soda an oxymoron ? " @entity11 , " the new drink distributed by @entity2 's partner in @entity14 , @entity15 , contains dextrin , a dietary fiber that dissolves in water and is found in fiber supplements such as @entity10			1
eaten appropriately , in fiber - rich foods such as vegetables and fruits , fiber helps to regulate the digestive system , lower cholesterol and may lower the risk of heart disease			1
a @entity15 news release claims the drink acts by " suppressing the absorption of fat " and can inhibit the rise in triglycerides after a meal , making it , potentially , the first " healthy " soda			1
because of these purported health benefits , @entity11 has received the label " @entity36 " in @entity14 , a government designation that stands for " @entity35			1
" a @entity14 government website states that " @entity36 " products are meant to be consumed " by people who wish to control health conditions , including blood pressure or blood cholesterol			1
" spokespeople for @entity2 did not provide more information about the " low - calorie " drink			1
time : soda machines will post calorie counts on vending machines as odd as the fiber - packed cola sounds , however , it 's not the first to debut in @entity14			2
@entity52 , the @entity14 beer company , launched the country 's first " @entity36 " beverage with dextrin in the spring called @entity57 , a sugar - free beverage geared towards " health conscious " men in their 30s			2
is there anything to the dextrin trend ? a 2006 study conducted by researchers from the @entity67 in @entity68 found that rats fed both dextrin and fat absorbed less fat than the rats who did not eat the fiber			0
but that research , alas , was n't extended to people			0
in fact , too much dextrin could make you sick			0
" studies of humans ingesting dextrin suggest short - term risks including stomach pain , gas , and bloating , " says @entity79 , editorial director of @entity80 , the @entity82 's nutrition website			0
" the long - term risks have not been studied			0
" dr. @entity91 , chair of nutrition at the @entity82 , added in an email statement : " unless @entity2 can provide data from controlled studies in humans to the contrary , their claim should be regarded as bogus and deceptive			2
" in fact , @entity2 may face challenges if it decides to bring @entity11 to the @entity102 , since the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) tends to frown on such potentially suspect nutrient - boosting of essentially unhealthy products in an attempt to make them healthier			1
in fact , its regulations specifically discourage such fortifying : " the @entity103 does not encourage indiscriminate addition of nutrients to foods , nor does it consider it appropriate to fortify fresh produce ; meat , poultry , or fish products ; sugars ; or snack foods such as candies and carbonated beverages			2
" " you should n't add good things to bad things because that could encourage people to eat something that is n't healthy for them , " said @entity123 , executive director of the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , a food safety and nutrition consumer advocacy group			0
time : cutting out soda curbs children 's weight gain , studies show in the @entity102 , soda companies have been called out for making exaggerated health claims about their sugary drinks			1
@entity124 recently sued @entity143 's parent company @entity142 for making specious health claims about its @entity145 , mixed @entity146 , and @entity148 varieties , arguing that drinking a soda with a small amount of @entity151 is not as healthy as consuming antioxidants from fruits , as the company implied			1
( the company decided to discontinue the line			0
) in 2008 , the @entity103 sent a letter to @entity158 , arguing that the company " misbranded " its " @entity160 " because it did not provide enough nutritional information to justify the word " plus			2
" so as appealing as it sounds to down a healthy dose of fiber from a can , health experts say it 's probably best to get your daily allotment from food if you want to truly take advantage of the good things fiber can do			2
" i would assume it 's a soda and treat it that way , " @entity175 , a registered dietitian in the @entity177 area and spokesperson for @entity179 , says about the beverage			0
" whole grains , vegetables , barley , beans , lentils have significant positive effects like lowering blood glucose , and some of that will make you feel more full			0
it is also more satisfying to chew and swallow real food rather than to drink a beverage			0
" time : study shows too much sugar increases heart risks not to mention that guzzling soda and sugary drinks contributes to health problems like obesity , diabetes , heart disease , and may raise blood pressure as well			1
" adding a fiber to a drink made from caffeine , caramel coloring , phosphoric acid , sugar , and high fructose corn syrup does n't make it healthy , " says @entity206 , a dietitian at @entity207 and spokesperson for the @entity209			0
" if people think they 're going to lose weight by drinking a beverage like this , then they are more likely to drink more soda and therefore consume even more calories			0
" which would simply make any of the purported health benefits fizzle out			0
