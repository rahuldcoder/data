-- tennis and fashion have been inextricably linked since the sport 's early years of organized competition just before the turn of the 20th century			2
when @entity8 legend @entity7 had to audacity to wear a knee - length skirt at the @entity11 , the ripples were felt in wider society			0
fast forward to 2010 , and her modern equivalent as the queen of style , @entity15 , has just signed a record $ 70 million endorsement deal with sportswear giants @entity18			1
integral to the deal was the introduction of a special tennis clothing line , designed by the @entity25 - born , @entity24 - based player , for which she will get a share of the profits			2
" it 's really incredible to be able to bring these looks that i love to so many women , " the 23 - year - old said at its subsequent launch			0
the highs and lows of the @entity41 sisters ' wardrobe @entity15 , who is the hottest property in women 's sport , has always been a dedicated follower of fashion -- and wowed audiences at the 2007 @entity46 with a stunning red dress , encrusted with no less than 600 @entity49 crystals			2
she suffered a shock loss in the third round , but was certainly the winner in the style stakes			0
@entity55 's fashion faux - pas ? however , tennis fashion sense is not confined to the female elite , and men 's world number one @entity55 has certainly provoked a reaction with his @entity61 collection			1
last year , on the way to his fifth crown at @entity68 's famous @entity67 courts , the @entity63 superstar sported a special clothing line which brought much comment if not universal admiration			0
" his tennis may be nearly faultless but @entity55 proved once again that his fashion sense often lands wide of the mark , " quipped @entity73 's @entity72			1
but with respect to @entity55 and @entity15 , they still have some way to go before matching the sartorial successes of the legendary @entity81 , and @entity82 , one of the famous " @entity83 " from @entity8			1
after his successful playing career , @entity81 -- @entity73 's last grand slam winner back in 1936 -- was credited with inventing the sweatband			1
inspired by his success , he then designed a sports shirt with the distinct self - titled logo			0
it proved an commercial and style success as its influence spread to the area of modern cultural arena , with @entity73 " mods " wearing it as a trademark item as they faced up to their " rocker " rivals			2
the brand is now owned by a @entity104 corporation , and enjoyed a revival when sported by @entity73 ace @entity106 , although he subsequently signed with @entity107 for 2010			0
@entity108 ' the crocodile ' perhaps @entity81 was copying @entity82 , who forged his reputation in the 1920s with a flamboyant playing style which brought him seven grand slam singles titles			1
in 1933 , the player nicknamed " the crocodile " founded a sports clothing company with @entity117 , called @entity108			0
naturally , they produced a tennis shirt which had an alligator - type figure embroidered on the chest			0
like @entity81 's brand , it has moved into the wider world of fashion , and for a spell during the early 1980s a @entity108 polo shirt was an absolute - must item in the wardrobe of every young man			1
according to @entity134 , in this period , the @entity108 business was worth $ 400 million in the @entity24 alone			0
beware the ' @entity136 disease ' but both @entity81 and @entity82 have suffered from what branding expert @entity137 called the " @entity136 disease " -- namely being solely associated with a certain group of people , who were not highly regarded			1
@entity136 became a must - have fashion accessory of @entity73 football hooligans , but in recent years has re-branded itself and profits have flowed			0
@entity137 , the global ceo of @entity145 , believes the continued success of @entity81 and @entity82 owes much to their legendary status in the game but also to their brand positioning			1
" they transcended the sport itself and have come to stand for things in their own right , " he told @entity0			0
and the key to future success ? " they have to position themselves as ' premium brands ' with more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship , " he said			0
a career after tennis where @entity81 and @entity82 forged the brand trail , others have followed , with @entity169 the best example			1
in the 1980s , not only did the @entity171 set a record with five straight @entity61 titles , but his tight - fitting sportswear and trademark headband immediately singled him out as a style icon			2
like @entity15 , his endorsement of other brands such as @entity180 trainers and @entity182 sportswear massively boosted their profits and helped establish the companies as major industry players			2
retiring at the tender age of 26 , @entity169 had some well - documented difficulties , but the fashion line he launched in 1987 has proved a commercial winner , promoting a daring range of underwear plus general sports and casual clothes and accessories			1
when @entity55 and @entity15 eventually call time on their illustrious careers , it remains to be seen if they turn their talents to forging their own brands or stay within the @entity18 family			1
but should they venture down this route , their predecessors as champions on the court and in the field of fashion will take some beating .			0
