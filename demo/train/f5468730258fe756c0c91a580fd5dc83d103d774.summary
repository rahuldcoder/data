-- what if you could change history ? would you go back and kill @entity4 before the @entity5 ? @entity6 before @entity7 was assassinated ? stop @entity8 before the 9/11 attacks ? of course you would			1
but what if you had to stand by and let those events unfold in order to achieve a more perfect future ? that 's the premise posed in " @entity15 , " a new time - travel thriller from award - winning author , @entity17			1
in the future , there 's no hunger , no war , no crime			1
at least , that 's what we 're led to believe			2
it 's @entity27 's job to keep it that way			1
he 's been sent back in time , to something similar to our present , to protect the integrity of the future timeline			1
to do that , @entity27 has to make sure that an imminent disaster of epic proportions , called " @entity38 " happens just as history says it will , or does , or did			1
in his mission , @entity41 faces off with other time travelers , enemy agents called hags , short for historical agitators , who want to prevent this apocalypse			2
along the way , @entity27 crosses paths with an eclectic cast of characters , including a young @entity52 lawyer seeking answers about her brother , a soldier killed in @entity55 ; a disgraced former @entity56 agent ; and a young @entity58 woman trapped as an indentured servant to a @entity61 diplomat			1
soon cracks start to appear in the timeline and @entity27 starts to doubt his mission			1
do n't let the description of the plot mislead you , this is not your typical sci - fi novel			2
@entity17 is less concerned with the intricacies of time travel , focusing more on the nature of history and how it 's shaped			1
as the saying goes , " history is written by the victors " -- but what if there were no winners in this scenario ? in " @entity15 , " @entity17 presents a compelling and complex page - turner , a paranoid thriller for the post- 9/11 age			1
@entity0 recently sat down with @entity17 to talk about his new book ; the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what was the spark that led to this book ? @entity17 : there were a lot of sparks			1
it 's a book that involves different narratives			2
i 'd had the idea of this guy who comes back from the future and has to prevent bad things from happening			1
he 's justifying his bad means because there 's going to be a perfect end			2
i just thought that was an intriguing moral angle			0
i thought it was fun and i thought it had interesting interplay with the idea of intelligence agencies occasionally doing bad things but saying , oh it 's for a good cause			2
i 'd heard a story about this issue of domestic servants basically being kept as slaves in these really nice houses in @entity52 because their bosses are diplomats who can hide behind diplomatic immunity , and i thought that was a really interesting idea but i was n't sure what i was going to do with it			0
i was also interested in the idea of intelligence agents , either governmental or private , following peace activists , because that was happening			0
it 's not legal , it 's not supposed to happen , but you hear stories about police officers , mysterious agents , agent provocateurs with a group of peace activists , trying to get them all amped up so they would do something wrong so they could get arrested			2
you 'd like to think these things do n't happen , but you keep hearing about things like that happening			0
i thought that would be an intriguing story			0
so , i was kind of juggling these different ideas , then i put it aside , but i still , every now and then , would work on it			0
there were a lot of false starts with this			0
it took me a while to get some of these threads together in a way that i liked them			0
there were these different stories that i liked that i wanted to figure out and i asked myself , is this one book ? do these things go together ; do i need to cut some of them out ? i did end up cutting out some of the activist stuff , but i wanted to find a way to thread these different narratives together and see if it could all come together			0
it may have been a little messy but i hope in the end it worked			0
@entity0 : you really play with the idea of " history " in your book			2
@entity17 : as somebody who has previously written two historical novels , in a lot of ways this book is a departure for me			1
at the same time this book is sort of about history , how it 's formed and how we are products of our own history			1
the question comes up in the book ; do we control our own fate ? can we make our own history or are we just pawns ? that taps into this conspiracist view of the world that created a lot of great fiction and film in the 1970 like " @entity190 " and " @entity191			2
" there 's this sense that there 's this vast conspiracy of forces controlling us , that the government is listening to everything we do and there 's nothing we can do about it			2
it 's easy to think that way , especially now , but at the same time we also believe we 're a country where a skinny interracial kid ... can become president			1
you never really know what 's going to happen ; you never know what 's going to be historically important			2
there 's the butterfly effect where one little thing here could change the world for someone else			2
so i was thinking about that a lot and the struggle that we all feel ; how much control do i have over my fate , the country , my community ? do i really believe in a perfect future ? some of us would like to think we 're creating a better future , especially if we 're in politics or public service			0
we 're trying to take a bad situation and make it better			0
but how much better can we make it ? are we just pushing a rock up a hill and it 's going to come down and crush us again ? do we really believe in a perfect society and the idea that @entity237 is a noble experiment and we 're still working on it to try and get it right ? can anything really be perfect and does that road lead to these totalitarian regimes ? the desire to create a better world is a noble goal and we all have it but it can be taken in scary directions			0
when you have these totalitarian nations , these communist nations that say they 're creating a perfect society when really most of us would say they 've done the opposite			0
trying to control history , or the lack of control , that 's something the book deals with			1
@entity0 : how did you handle the idea of time travel in your novel ? @entity17 : i did n't want to write a book with some guy zipping in and out of various situations ; i wanted it to be set in the here and now			1
i liked the idea of a time traveler not just for the moral dilemma but i think he has a great perspective on how he sees our world now , all the tensions in our society , the issues of race and ethnicity			0
to him he 's coming from many , many generations later			0
i was influenced by this @entity289 cover story , the face of the future and there was this computer program that melded thousands of faces , many generations later after all the races have mixed , this is what people will look like			0
if i want to be realistic about the idea of a time traveler coming from the future , he 's not going to look like us , he 's not going to be a white guy , he 's not going to be a black guy , he 's going to be kind of this amalgam			1
in any book , it 's not a new idea in a time travel story to have everybody say , wait a minute are you just pulling one over on us , are you crazy , are you a reliable narrator ? that was fun to work in			1
@entity0 : " the @entity15 " includes a lot of great detail about @entity237 intelligence agencies			1
tell me how you researched all of this ? @entity17 : as with a lot of fiction , some of it was smoke and mirrors and the rest of it was basically just doing a lot of reading			1
i was n't a spy and i do n't have any friends who were spies , as far as i know			0
the book changed a lot ; i went in different directions because the more i learned i would find a more believable way to advance the story			0
i think the initial idea i had would n't have worked as well and i do n't think it would have made you think , " wow , this guy knows what he 's talking about			0
" i learned as i went and i was able to tell a more realistic story as a result			0
but i did n't go on any drive - bys with any spies , although that would have been cool			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity17 : i 've actually written a lot of my next book already , it 's historical again			1
i 'm from @entity348 , @entity349 actually , but i 'm a @entity350 fan			0
it 's loosely based on a real story , that i found out about in an offhand mention , about @entity355 involvement in @entity348 sports , it 's a legacy that dates back to 1945 when the @entity355 was following a group of communists who wanted to racially integrate baseball			1
i thought , wow ! what 's that story ? so it 's sort of a spy novel , it 's also got a bit of romance , and even comedy			0
i 've got an @entity355 agent , i 've also got a female communist sports writer and i 've got a baseball star of the @entity372 back from @entity373 i said i was n't going to keep writing in a historical vein but sometimes i see an idea and i think that 's just too cool			2
it 's been fun to write			0
