-- i have been a professional educator for 40 years			2
i have worked at every level of the public school spectrumâ € ” elementary through high school			2
having been in education for such a long time , i have witnessed many changes , all aimed at school improvement			1
needless to say , not all the suggestions have been sensible			2
what may appear to be a good idea on paper , or when sitting around a table in discussion of it , does not always make for good reality , especially at the schoolhouse			1
it is important to note that most of the dictates for schools are proposed by people who have never taught			2
regardless of the studies and research aimed at school improvement , i believe good educators have always known what makes schools work more efficiently			2
however , we get bogged down in rhetoric and what is " hot " at the moment			2
i believe that sustained school improvement will take guts ( good old fashioned courage ) , focus and stamina			1
here are a few tenets that make sense to me : if a child is not present at school , he or she can not possibly learn			1
schools that consistently report high student achievement consistently have students with great attendance			1
yet one of our greatest school problems is student attendance			0
why do we have to beg parents to get their children to school , to convince them that we need their children present and as stress free as possible ? a parent asked me once why her child needed to come to school every day			1
she was actually upset that the school district had a policy that addressed absent and tardy children			0
she said it was not the school 's business to tell her how to raise her children			0
of course , that did not make sense			1
students are often caught in the middle of home / school discord			1
we should be on the same page ! in an ideal world , all parents would recognize the need for excellence and consistency			0
until the world reaches that ideal state , we must continue to strive for improved communication between home and school			0
@entity84 : how schools kill creativity all children must have a champion , one who makes solid and sensible decisions that will help them grow into mature , happy and reliable adults			0
it does not have to be a parent , but it has to be someone			0
and while it makes sense to hold home to a standard , where are our standards for educators ? why do we allow incompetence to remain ? doing so does not make sense			1
many poor teachers stay on the job for decades and it is often the poorest schools that are saddled with the poorest teachers			1
i am not aware of any corporate entity ( other than schools ) that passes incompetence around in a circle			0
if it is proven that a teacher ca n't teach ( as indicated by low student performance , low enthusiasm , non-existent relationships with students and co-workers ) why are n't they fired ? sports franchises look for the best players and coaches to create a winning team			1
they hire scouts to find the best personnel and pay them accordingly			0
i believe that if we paid for excellence and then insisted on it , the academic complexion of our schools would change dramatically			0
at the public schoolhouse , the players are on the team by default			0
public school educators do not get to choose who makes the team and who does n't			2
everyone who walks on the field must be coached they may not all be first string , all of them may not make the college or pro team , but they must all know how the game is played and the rules for doing so			1
it is impossible to create an excellent team with inferior coaching , with players who are allowed to make up their own rules			2
championship schools and classrooms are deliberate , not accidental			0
@entity84 : your elusive creative genius it makes sense to pay attention -- our students give us clues about their lives every day			2
signs that a student will potentially drop out are evident long before high school , but that is often when we begin to take notice			0
negative and belligerent attitudes , poor academic performance , low attendance rates and a failure to develop positive relationships are evident early on in many children			0
however , our school counselors and social workers have been cut from the school budget , or have been assigned other duties			0
a large percentage of children who drop out of high school read far below grade level			0
the problem presents itself at the elementary level , yet children are continuously passed on			0
would n't it make more sense to intensely focus on teaching students to read ? instead , we opt for placing them in special education			1
not wanting to be considered " mentally retarded , " children are embarrassed and angry and therefore drop out socially long before their physical departure			0
@entity84 : where does creativity hide ? it makes sense to create a winning spirit in children			0
all may not want to attend college , but that is what we push for all			1
why do we make the students who want to learn a skill or trade feel inferior to their college bound counterparts ? that does n't seem fair , nor does it make sense			1
we have basically told children that they will be useless citizens without a college degree			2
the last time i needed a plumber , i did n't ask for his college diploma , i checked for this level of expertise and proof of customer satisfaction			1
teachers should encourage skill excellence and passion for whatever students choose to do or become			1

@entity230 : education is beset by fads , but there are some basic truths
it takes guts to hold students and teachers *accountable* , she says
if a child is n't present , he or she ca n't learn ; fire teachers who always fail , she says
@entity248 : do n't push every child to go to college or make them feel *worthless* if they do n't
