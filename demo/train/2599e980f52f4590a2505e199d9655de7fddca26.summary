-- who will fire the next salvo in the ongoing friendly feud between tv host @entity4 and @entity5 , the @entity6 - based animation studio known for its sarcastic @entity8 re-enactments of @entity10 news ? it all started in november when @entity5 marked @entity4 's debut on cable channel @entity13 with an animated clip poking fun at his awkward exit from @entity17 earlier this year			1
( @entity13 is owned by @entity18 , which also owns @entity0			0
) this was nothing unusual , as @entity5 already had produced videos spoofing @entity24 's @entity23 antenna problems and @entity27 's escapee flight attendant @entity25			1
but this time @entity4 responded with a tongue - in - cheek parody of @entity5 , complete with exaggerated characters and cheesy visuals			1
it did n't stop there			0
within 48 hours , @entity5 answered the comedian 's response with another , more elaborate and very funny video alleging that " @entity43 's cheap knock - off " was produced by an oppressed gang of @entity10 child laborers who once worked for @entity40 at his @entity41			1
last week on his show , the comedian said @entity46 would fire off another rebuttal , but it would take a while because his program only has one animator			1
" we want to respond , " he said			0
online video " feuds " are popular nowadays , and like the @entity53 back - and - forth , they 're generally in good fun			2
in november , the @entity58 tabloid @entity57 lampooned the popular @entity60 ads to promote its barely clad page 3 girls			0
in one video , a topless page 3 model does a play - by - play parody of @entity66 's @entity60 shower ad , with her long red tresses and other props covering any naughty bits			2
what 's unique about @entity4 is that he 's using an old medium , tv , to engage a new medium , @entity75			1
it gives more credibility to a web - based company like @entity5 and makes late - night television seem more timely and urgent			2
expect more cross-medium smackdowns in the future			0
your move , @entity46 .			0

@entity5 parodies @entity4 's return to television with an animated video
@entity4 answers with his own animation spoof , so @entity5 mocks his show again
@entity4 says he *'ll* fire back , but only has one animator
