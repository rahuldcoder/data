-- sing in the shower , not in public			0
that 's the message to anyone visiting one @entity6 beach community			1
the town of @entity9 's island has proposed an ordinance that would make it illegal to belt out show tunes , pop songs , or any musical notes , for that matter , if they disturb the peace			1
" i have n't had one islander complain about it , " said @entity18 , the town administrator			2
" there are places where you can go and be loud and vociferous			1
@entity24 is not one of them			1
" " we want you to have a good time but in the same sense we want you to act respectful and if you do n't we have a tool to deal with it , " @entity18 added			0
that tool would be a ticket from a police officer for a maximum fine of $ 500			1
and the ban is n't just for singing			0
the measure reads as follows : " it shall be unlawful for any person to yell , shout , hoot , whistle , or sing on the public streets , particularly between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or at any time or place so as to annoy or disturb the comfort , or repose of persons in any office , or in any dwelling , or other type of residence , or of any persons in the vicinity			0
" the town , which is on a barrier island just north of @entity56 , has a population of about 2,000 but swells to around 5,000 during summer weekends , @entity18 said			1
he called it " first and foremost a single residential community			0
" there are a lot of visitors to the beach 24 hours a day , " he said , " and we just need a way to maintain the quiet family atmosphere			2
" the town council has already voted two times for the ordinance and after a third vote in july , it is expected to be put into effect in august , @entity18 said			2
he said the welcome mat is always open for people to enjoy the town but made it clear loud , disruptive noises , including public singing during quiet hours , will not be tolerated			1
" there are probably six or seven little restaurants in the town that stay open until 2 a.m. , " he said			0
" people are leaving , ( having ) had a good time all night			0
maybe they do n't know they are being loud and think it 's okay			0
