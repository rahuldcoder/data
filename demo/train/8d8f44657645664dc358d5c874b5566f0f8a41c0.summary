-- a tide of border crossings by children mostly from @entity4 is not expected to end soon , and some in @entity5 blame president @entity6 for policies they claim opened the floodgate			1
holding centers in @entity11 can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling alone with their kids , forcing the federal government to open additional facilities			1
one is in @entity18 , @entity19 , where pictures of unaccompanied children lying on the floor of a large barren facility raised concerns of a humanitarian crisis			1
but @entity18 mayor @entity26 said the site , which serves as an overflow center for up to 1,000 , is addressing the immediate need for shelter			1
" i 'm very comfortable with what i saw , " he said on @entity0 's " @entity31			2
" he said there are makeshift cafeterias and medical centers and that telephone banks and computers have been set up to process people and contact relatives			2
border crossers unaccompanied children and partial families from @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 make up the majority of those crossing the border , creating a delicate situation for states , the federal government and immigrants			1
of the 1,200 or so crossing the @entity52 in eastern @entity11 every day , up to 400 are unaccompanied children , said rep. @entity54 , a @entity11 @entity55 who represents the district where most of the crossings occur			1
" this is a humanitarian crisis , " he said in a phone interview , adding that the government has to figure out how to feed , diaper and care for the children as young as infants			1
many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the @entity52 , equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the @entity70 site to surrender			2
the illegal immigrants include a group of @entity43 girls , some as young as 14			1
one told @entity0 she did so " because i want to see my parents in @entity76			0
" the @entity6 administration is not releasing the statistics or much information about the recent influx			0
but @entity81 , a labor leader for @entity70 agents , told @entity0 that he expects 60,000 unaccompanied children will cross the border this year			1
the @entity85 has kept track and said that about 8,000 minors crossed alone in any given year			0
but there was a sharp increase in 2011 , including 10,000 in @entity91 custody that summer			0
" you 're talking kids from 17 years old on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old , traveling by themselves , " @entity81 said			0
last year , roughly 10 % of people caught by @entity70 agents were minors , according to an agency official			0
why are they coming ? some members of @entity5 say @entity6 's policies and a lack of enforcement are to blame			1
" the president has sent the message out he is not going to enforce the law , " rep. @entity108 , an @entity110 @entity109 whose commentary on immigration reform drew sharp criticism , told @entity0 's " @entity31			0
" " that message has echoed out			0
" critics , such as @entity108 , point to @entity6 's decision in 2012 to stop most deportations of young people brought to the @entity91 as children			1
@entity26 said that could be the reason children are coming in droves , but many involved in the issue say the reasons are much broader and complex			1
a recent @entity130 report that interviewed 400 young immigrants points to a difficult and complicated web of reasons , including difficult - to - escape gang and societal violence in @entity43 , @entity45 and @entity44 as well as dire economic situations and the desire to reunify with their parents or family members in the @entity91			1
state outrage @entity11 has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants , including minors , to @entity19			1
@entity19 gov. @entity145 slammed the move			1
" not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy , it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here , " she said in a statement			0
after the children have been processed , the are transferred to @entity157 run facilities at @entity159 in @entity11 or @entity161 @entity160 in @entity162			1
the administration announced that a third facility in @entity166 , @entity167 , which will house up to 1,200 minors			0
@entity167 governor @entity168 also criticized the decision , questioning if the site is really going to be a temporary fix or turn into something more permanent as the number of young immigrants is expected to keep increasing			2
" i am dismayed by what appears to be an endless cycle of illegal immigration , temporary housing and eventual amnesty for those who have broken our laws			0
today 's news is the latest in a long line of policy missteps that the @entity91 people are paying for			0
" what 's next @entity91 law prohibits the @entity189 from immediately deporting the children if they are not from @entity191 or @entity192			2
instead , the children are turned over to @entity196 supervision " within 72 hours of @entity189 taking them into custody , " an official said			2
relatives living in the @entity91 are searched for and contacted and the immigrant is given a court date			0
but very few actually show up and the children often become one of the millions of undocumented immigrants			2
@entity6 declared the crossings " an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response			0
" earlier this month , in a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies , he announced an " interagency @entity212 to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation			0
" the group will oversee coordination with state , local and other agencies			0
homeland security secretary @entity222 is establishing the group			0
in a statement , he said that " addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the @entity189			1
" the administration is also forced to ask @entity5 for more money to address the higher - than - expected number of cases			2
@entity54 , who sits on the @entity234 , said the administration originally asked for $ 800 million to address the matter , but that number has gone up to $ 2.1 billion			0
@entity6 vows urgent action as children make perilous illegal journey into @entity91 @entity242 setback for underage visa applicants @entity0 's @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this story			2
