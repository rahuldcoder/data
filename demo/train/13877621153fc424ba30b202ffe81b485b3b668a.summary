despite herculean efforts to keep baby 's environment clean , germs happen			1
most infants will have between six and eight respiratory infections ( colds , ear infections , bronchitis ) each year			0

even though it is impossible to completely control a newborn 's environment , there are a few things that parents can do to limit a new baby 's exposure without making themselves nutty in the process			1
8 @entity82 hold all calls tell @entity84 with the runny nose to stay away ! it 's important to keep a young infant from anyone with symptoms of infection : fevers , sore throats , coughs , sniffles and sneezes			0
remind excited relatives and friends that the gift of keeping their germs to themselves trumps any teddy bear or romper set			0
clean team wash your hands			0

it 's also the single most important thing a person caring for a newborn can do			0

everything parents need to know about immunizations open mouth , insert germs the truth about toys , pets and play groups by the time baby 's immune system has strengthened ( with the help of recommended vaccines ) your kid has discovered his mouth			1
sadly , baby 's cravings for mommy 's keys do n't disappear quickly			1
in fact , putting things , including his soiled hands , in his mouth will continue into toddlerhood and is a normal way for baby to explore and learn about his world			2
however , it 's best to keep your little one from tasting too many dirty doodads , especially when they 've previously hit the pavement , another child 's mouth or @entity181 's doghouse			0
we know this is n't easy , especially since baby 's world has grown to include playgrounds , play dates and trips to grocery stores , banks and other germy wonderlands			2

10 @entity198 - tested hand - washing tricks wash up ! at about 8 to 12 months , teach your tot how to wash his hands			0
regular soap and water does the trick ( antibacterial types have not proven more effective )			2
get in the habit of washing baby 's hands before he eats ( including snacks ) and after diaper changes , visits to the playground , petting an animal or coughing , sneezing or wiping his nose			2
if soap and water are not available , alcohol - based gels or wipes will suffice			2
the trouble with toys to clean or not to clean ? most of the time , washing toys with soap and water and letting them air - dry every couple weeks is fine			1
but when there is a gaggle of kids manhandling baby 's toys ( or a play date with another drooly baby ) , the risk for bacteria rises			1
these times call for a regular household bleach wash ( one - quarter cup of household bleach to one gallon of water or one tablespoon of household bleach to one quart of water )			2
@entity242 , rinse thoroughly and air - dry the goods			0
@entity245 toys are germ magnets and are harder to clean , so you might want to put these away during the next play date			1

) shot in the arm ( or leg ) vaccinations are not just important for baby			2
make sure both parents and caregivers are up - to - date on their immunizations as well			0
most important are the influenza vaccine , which everyone older than 6 months should receive each fall , and the @entity283 ( tetanus , diphtheria and pertussis ) vaccine , which is given to adults as a booster every 10 years			0
consult your physician about when you 're due			0

the song is just long enough to get his tiny mitts squeaky clean			0
