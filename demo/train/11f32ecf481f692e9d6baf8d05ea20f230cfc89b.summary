-- @entity1 is trying out a neat new feature that will give it magical @entity4 - like abilities			1
everybody 's favorite cloud - storage app has added photo and video import			1
in a new " @entity11 " of the app for @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , photos and videos will be slurped up from any memory card or camera connected to the computer			1
these will then be sent spinning off to the @entity1 servers , ready for access by all your other @entity1 - connected devices			2
there have already been some well reasoned complaints over in the @entity1 forums			0
for instance , some people might take so many photos that they do n't want them all clogging up their limited cloud storage			0
this feature also adds complexity to the @entity1 application itself , when it 's already pretty easy to have a third - party app store selected photos inside your @entity1 folder			1
on the other hand , anything that makes backing up photos easier can only be a good thing			0
and as most nerds are at home right now enjoying @entity47 's home cooking , might n't it be a good idea to make sure @entity47 's precious photos are also stored somewhere a little safer than the hard drive of her rickety old pc ? i think it 's a great idea , although i wo n't be recommending the feature to my parents until it makes it into an official non-beta build			0
and @entity1 has one big advantage over the current version of @entity60 's @entity4 : you can delete those embarrassing @entity63 photos			2
