he wrote of experiencing overpowering fear after an insurgent attack in @entity14 and the hatred that consumed him after getting " robbed			2
" @entity1 took his own .45 - caliber handgun onto the sprawling post wednesday and killed three people and wounded 16 more before taking his own life , according to authorities			1
they are trying to piece together what in his background and psychiatric treatment could have triggered a new round of bloodshed at the same @entity29 post where an officer killed 13 people in 2009			1
a 34 - year - old @entity14 war veteran with a history of depression and anxiety , @entity1 was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder before his shooting spree			1

a family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to @entity1			1
it is unclear whether his posts might help explain his mental state or a possible motive in the shootings			2
authorities have said the motive is not known			0
" given that the alleged shooter is deceased , the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did , " said @entity55 , a spokesman for the @entity56			0
in early march , around the time investigators said he purchased the .45 - caliber pistol used in the shootings , @entity1 wrote : " my spiritual peace has just gone			1

three soldiers slain at @entity6 identified @entity10 wanted his minute of fame , @entity6 shooter writes @entity1 wrote that @entity10 " pretends to be a victim of a mental illness followed by addiction to violent video games " and that the shooter sought " international attention " and a " minute of fame as a villain			1
" he added , " it is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated			1
this makes the government indirect accomplice ... these bastards have perfected their way of attacking studying previous massacres to gain publicity and their minute of fame as a villain			0
but thanks to @entity108 and the sensational profiling by the media [ they ] give more power to those intelligent cowards			0
" another post dealt with his time in @entity14 : " celebrating life			2
it has been exactly 1 year and 2 days since left @entity14 seeing in @entity119 the most brutal explosion ... i was left paralyzed and started a discussion over the radio ... i was only focused on breathing deeply so that i do n't lose focus and continue the mission			0
[ those ] were hours of agony waiting for an attack by the insurgency but we were able to exit @entity119 all alive			2
i was in vehicle @entity130 worst was that # 5 was a diesel truck , the perfect target			0
and i was only thinking about getting back with my family			0
" @entity1 added : " to be in the line of fire is f --- -- up but even more f --- -- is the suffering of the families			1
" lt. gen. @entity139 , the post 's commanding general , said @entity1 did not experience direct combat in @entity14			1
" so far , we have not discovered any specific traumatic event , wounds received in action , contact with the enemy or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed , " the general said			2
@entity55 said authorities had " credible information " that @entity1 " was involved in a verbal altercation with soldiers from his unit just prior to him allegedly opening fire			1
" messages left saturday by @entity0 for @entity156 about the @entity4 posts were not immediately returned			0
in a statement friday , @entity1 ' father , also named @entity1 , asked for prayers for all those affected			1
he described the soldier as " a calm family man " and " a good son			0
" " my son could not have been in his right mind , " he said			0
" he was not like this			0
" @entity1 was @entity14 vet being treated for mental health issues looking for clues into @entity172 's actions , motive before wednesday 's shooting , @entity1 stopped at the post 's personnel office to pick up a leave form , according to the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack			1
@entity182 , sister of sgt. @entity183 , said on @entity0 's " @entity184 " that her brother " was at work and a guy came in and asked for a leave form			0
" the soldier was told he would have to come back later , @entity189 said			0
" and apparently i guess he did n't want to hear that , so he came back and just opened fire , " @entity189 said			0
@entity183 was shot four times , but released from a hospital friday , his sister said			0
law enforcement sources told @entity0 that investigators were searching for possible motives , including whether @entity1 was angry over canceled leave			1
