@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 took up surfing five years ago , he was regarded as @entity1 's first homegrown surfer			1
he 's no longer the only @entity7 catching waves , but with the sport still a niche interest in the @entity11 country , some are touting @entity1 as one of the world 's last undiscovered surfing destinations			1
@entity16 took up surfing shortly after the end of the 14 - year civil war that destroyed much of his country			1
he says being out in the waters off the @entity7 coast is like being in heaven			1
" nothing beats surfing , " @entity16 says			0
" i feel so happy			0
" while @entity16 may be a surfing pioneer in @entity1 , he 's not the only one taking advantage of the country 's undisturbed coastline			1
@entity31 runs @entity1 , which promotes the country as a surfing destination			1
a dentist by trade , he came to @entity1 five years ago after seeing the desperate need for better healthcare			1
he had spent four years working on a hospital ship in @entity11 , attending to the needs of some of the most deprived people in the world			0
but he was drawn to @entity1 and in 2008 the 37 - year - old @entity43 settled there permanently with his family			1
@entity31 and his few colleagues work long hours at a dental clinic based just outside of the capital , @entity48			0
surfing is @entity31 's release			2
" there 's such a massive need that you could work around the clock			0
you need to set some boundaries , " he says			0
@entity31 hits the water in his spare time with a group of regular surfers at a beach close to his home			0
there , they can enjoy the waves without having to compete for space			0
" our surfing community is 20 at the largest , " he says			0
" in most parts of the world where they have surf this good , that 's unheard of			2
" @entity0 is @entity1 's most popular destination for surfers , with five point breaks -- locations where waves break offshore -- within walking distance of each other			1
word of the uninterrupted surf is starting to filter through to tourists and some are heading to @entity1 's beaches			1
@entity89 surfer @entity88 is in @entity1 for six months with his surfer buddies , away from the more popular and more crowded surfing spots in @entity92 and @entity93			1
he knows it 's only a matter of time before more people discover what @entity1 has to offer			1
" we 've already talked with each other and said just breathe it in , suck it in , because it will not be the same when we come back , " he says			0
while @entity88 may want to keep the coastline a secret , local surfers hope their beaches will bring more tourists -- and more money -- to communities that currently depend on fishing for survival			2
but @entity1 is a long way from being a mass - tourism destination			2
" people are going to have to be prepared for some sort of adventure			0
it 's not a place where you can get a package holiday , " says @entity31			0
he believes it will be a while before there is a tourism boom in a country which is trying hard to rid itself of its reputation as a war - torn nation			2
" i think once we get beyond that stigma , then more people will come , " he says			0
" it 's still got a way to go -- public transport and roads are a bit of an issue -- but safety is not really an issue , crime is very low			0
" nonetheless , the @entity139 urges @entity141 citizens to " exercise caution when traveling in @entity1 , " while @entity144 's @entity143 advises against " all but essential travel to all areas of @entity1 outside the capital , @entity48			1
" both warn that crime is high , especially after dark			0
but while @entity1 undoubtedly still has economic and social problems , @entity31 believes surfers can help alleviate them			2
he encourages the surfing community to become involved in voluntary work and he hopes @entity1 's waves will entice more humanitarian workers who can help to rebuild the nation			1
" i 'm sure there are lots of dentists out there who surf , " he says			0
@entity16 is hoping it 's not just tourists who take advantage of his country 's surf			1
he wants more @entity7 to follow his lead and take up the sport			2
" i look at all the sports in our country -- people play soccer , basketball , and surfing is not part of that , " he says			2
" so i decided i want to bring surfing to @entity1 and make @entity1 one of the biggest surfing countries in the world			1
