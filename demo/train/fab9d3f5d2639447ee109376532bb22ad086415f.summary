-- if there is one institution that has made a point of desperately trying to keep women in their place , it 's organized religion			1
whether it 's @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11 , women are often relegated to secondary roles , their contributions seen as insignificant			1
in the @entity15 , that is taken a step further by refusing to even allow women to become priests			1
now , some catholic churches are alienating women by refusing to allow girls to serve as altar servants			1
in @entity22 , @entity23 , at @entity24 , the rev. @entity21 announced that the church will no longer train girls to be altar servants			1
that angered one woman at the church , who spoke to the @entity30 about the decision			0
according to the @entity30 : " @entity21 , who did not return phone calls for comment , wrote in the parish bulletin that he hoped the church would ' create opportunities , and perhaps clubs ' for girls as a way to help them find ways to serve the church , rather than serving at the altar			1
" the @entity15 of @entity41 has also ceased allowing girls to serve as altar servants , angering some there by taking such a hard - line stance			1
it would behoove these priests and archbishops to actually open up their bibles and realize that were it not for women , there might never have been @entity9			1
the @entity15 regards @entity53 as its first pope , teaching that it was @entity55 who gave @entity53 and the other disciples the direction to create the church			0
according to @entity60 16:17 - 20 , @entity55 said to @entity53 : " @entity61 are you , @entity63 son of @entity64 , for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood , but by my @entity68 in heaven			0
and i tell you that you are @entity53 , and on this rock i will build my church , and the gates of @entity73 will not overcome it			0
i will give you the @entity74 ; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven			0
" yet the @entity79 also records that when @entity55 was crucified , his disciples were scared to death of being killed themselves , so it was left to the female followers of @entity55 to stand guard to pray and weep as he hung on the cross			0
@entity86 19:25 says @entity55 ' mother , @entity87 , @entity87 the wife of @entity88 , and @entity89 all were standing vigil			0
when @entity55 was thirsty , the women , not a male disciple , gave him something to drink , before he died			2
when @entity55 was n't found in the tomb , who made that discovery ? a woman , @entity89 , not one of his disciples			0
when @entity87 went to get @entity53 and another disciple to show them that @entity55 was gone , they saw for themselves , and went back into hiding " with the doors locked for fear of the @entity108 leaders " ( @entity86 20:19 )			0
who was left to be visited by two angels and @entity55 ? no , not one of his male believers , but a crying @entity89 ! according to the account in @entity113 , @entity55 told @entity87 , " do not hold on to me , for i have not yet ascended to the @entity68			0
go instead to my brothers and tell them , ' i am ascending to my @entity68 and your @entity68 , to my @entity116 and your @entity116			0
' " when @entity89 did as ordered , the disciples , the fervent male followers of @entity55 , did n't even believe her			0
the @entity86 records that @entity55 had to show up for them to even believe that he had died and risen to heaven			0
now just imagine the @entity9 faith if women had not been standing guard			1
if women were n't as vigilant in believing in @entity55 , there might not even be a @entity124 today			2
that means no popes , no cardinals , no archbishops , no priests and no altar boys			2
when i was an altar boy for years at @entity133 in @entity134 , the role was simple : to serve as a helper to the priest			1
folks , there is nothing i did as an altar boy that a young woman could n't do			2
this decision by @entity15 leaders in @entity145 and @entity23 is nonsensical and unnecessary			0
all it does is drive a wedge through believers in the body of @entity55 , instead of expanding ways in which people can serve the church			2
such ignorance is one of the reasons why nondenominational @entity9 churches are growing at a faster rate than those associated with a denomination			1
as long as churches erect barriers to serving for believers , they will not be seen as welcoming places to worship			1
allowing women to serve as altar servants is the right thing to do ; it 's biblical			1
if women were good enough to stand guard and care for @entity55 , i 'm sure their female descendants are good enough to care for the church he commissioned			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

organized religion has long tried to keep women in their place , says @entity175
some catholic churches are now refusing to let girls serve as altar servants , he says
yet were it not for women , there might never have been @entity9 , @entity175 says
@entity175 : when churches erect barriers to serving , they *'re* seen as *unwelcoming*
