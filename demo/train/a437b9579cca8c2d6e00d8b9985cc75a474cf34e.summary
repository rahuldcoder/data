-- she added smart to sexy as a bond girl opposite @entity3 's 007 , and proved her dramatic and action credentials in " @entity5 , " but for actress @entity8 , life and acting are both all about balance			1
@entity8 : " there are reasons why you do movies			2
it 's for the love of it			2
" " i think it 's very boring for my audience , just to see me in the regular roles			1
i love my action films			1
and i think right now , i have a nice balance , " she told @entity0 's @entity22			2
poise and balance are something that @entity8 is naturally blessed with			2
her childhood dream of becoming a professional ballerina was dashed when she sustained an injury while training at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
however , she continued to study completing a degree in dance and a minor in drama , before serving as miss @entity36 at the age of 21 , which was more of an ambassadorial role for the country 's tourism industry than bikini modeling			2
making her film debut in an action movie in 1984 , she made further appearances in @entity46 action films doing her own stunts , until she married millionaire @entity46 businessman @entity49 in 1988 and put her career on hold			1
on giving up acting for the sake of her married life she said : " at that time , it 's very difficult to try and juggle a normal life , be where your husband is , try to start a family life , and filming months on end in another country			1
so i weighed my options			2
i am a person that believes , you have to give your all			2
there 's no half measure in doing things			0
you do it well or at least you 've got to give it your best shot			0
" the couple divorced three years later and @entity8 resumed her film career in 1992 in the @entity74 smash - hit " @entity73			0
" while she continued to use her athleticism in her roles and do her own stunts , in the pursuit of playing good characters and that all - important balance , she credits the directors she has chosen to work with			1
" i look at the scripts and you can understand where the story is going ... but it 's a director with a vision that brings it to life , " she said			0
" there are reasons why you do movies			0
it 's for the love of it or you 're thinking of your paycheck			0
and you have to find your own balance			0
" when it came to doing " @entity5 , " @entity99 was the essential ingredient			1
" i did it really because i adore @entity99			0
that 's a true film maker , where they move you , they bring you to places where you ca n't imagine but want to be			0
" but being an all - or - nothing person has taken its toll when it has come to the stunts she has performed			1
@entity8 tore her anterior cruciate ligament after the first sequence she performed for " @entity5 , " which meant that only the dramatic scenes in the film could be shot until she had recovered			1
@entity8 has turned her attention to producing as well as acting and found it a challenging experience			1
" as an actor you would be judged on how your performance is and so that 's where your focus is			0
it 's a very selfish environment and that sense , because as you know , you ca n't make excuses afterwards			0
but as a producer , you have to make sure everyone is well protected and everyone is safe			0
and if anything goes wrong , it 's all on your shoulders , " she told @entity0			0
the films she produced , 2002 's " @entity135 " and " @entity136 " from 2004 were panned by critics , but she makes no excuses : " that 's the nature of the business			1
you should never take these things personally when it works or does n't work			0
" and when it comes to passing on what she 's learned to young @entity149 actors , her advice is typically practical			1
" for any @entity149 face , or any @entity149 girls that have dreams , aspirations or doing crossover work in @entity155 , you must have the language			1
and then afterwards , the right face , the right demeanor , and the right chemistry			0
