@entity0 -- @entity1 readers had a mixture of admiration and disdain for " @entity6 , " the anonymous @entity8 programmer who outsourced his work to a @entity11 firm for one - fifth of his paycheck			1
the incident was investigated by @entity14 after a client company noticed the firm 's computer system was regularly being accessed from @entity11			1
investigators found the employee had " physically fedexed his @entity20 token to @entity11 so that the third - party contractor could log - in under his credentials during the workday , " according to @entity27 , a senior forensic investigator for @entity14			0
" this guy must have read the ` 4 - hour workweek ' book			0
he was doing exactly what the book recommends , " wrote one @entity1 reader , a sentiment echoed elsewhere			2
" heard this on @entity1 this morning and thought the same exact thing -- he must be a @entity40 fan ! " wrote a reader identified as @entity36			1
@entity8 programmer outsources own job to @entity11 , surfs cat videos @entity40 , however , is n't a fan of the tactics of " @entity6			1
" the author of the blockbuster time management book series -- which advocates personal outsourcing as part of his formula for earning more in less time -- said subterfuge and allowing someone unauthorized access to the company computers is not the way forward			1
" productivity should benefit the collective , not put it at risk , " @entity40 told @entity1 by e-mail			1
" as much as i love cat photos , creating security breaches is n't a good career move			1
it 's also bad karma			1
" an average day for " @entity6 " included watching cat videos and logging into @entity66 and @entity67			0
he would then send an end - of - day report on the work he paid a company in @entity71 , @entity11 , to do for him			2
" @entity73 is about maximizing your per - hour output -- increasing personal effectiveness			0
it 's about creating abundance and not about screwing your employer , " @entity40 said			2
" this is why i work with some of the fastest growing start - ups in @entity83 ( @entity84 , @entity85 , etc. ) : they want maximal leverage			0
" is there a way " @entity6 " could have done this without jeopardizing his job ? " if you want to structure a remote - work agreement , voluntarily work several consecutive saturdays and measure your output increases ( e.g. deals closed , client hours booked , etc. ) , " @entity40 said			1
" use data and a logical argument to show your bosses that you can contribute more while being location - independent			0
" @entity40 also advises : " if you want increased power and negotiating ability within your organization , increase your per - hour output			0
focus on the @entity105 : identifying the 20 % of activities ( also products / services ) that produce 80 % of the results you or your bosses want			0
" @entity112 ( or create ) metrics that allow your supervisors to measure your performance improvements and contributions , " he said			0
still , many readers admired the unknown -- and now unemployed -- programmer			0
" it reminds me of a quote from ' @entity127 ' that went something like ' what is admirable on a grand scale is abhorrent on a small scale ' , " commented another @entity1 reader known as @entity120 , referring to the 1967 movie about a @entity123 murder investigation during @entity124 " ceo 's do this every day and they get stock options and their picture on @entity137 front cover			2
