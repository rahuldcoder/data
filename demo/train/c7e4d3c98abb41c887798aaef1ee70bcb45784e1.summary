@entity0 -- a @entity4 man held for years in military custody in the @entity6 was charged friday in federal court with conspiracy " to provide material support and resources " to @entity11 , prosecutors announced			1
@entity12 was a student at @entity13 in @entity14 when he was arrested in 2001			1
the @entity15 was to hear arguments in april on a challenge by the suspect , @entity12 , to the principle that the president has the authority to detain suspected terrorists indefinitely and without charges			1
the @entity24 on friday asked the high court to dismiss that pending appeal			2
" because the military detention challenged by the petitioner has ended , no live controversy remains in this case , " said @entity28 administration lawyers in their brief			0
@entity35 's lawyers oppose such a move , saying the fundamental constitutional question of military detentions needs to be answered			0
the federal indictment means the case will be transferred to civilian courts for prosecution			1
@entity42 , one of @entity12 's lawyers , visited him at the naval brig in @entity44 , @entity45 , on friday to show him the indictment charging him with terrorism			1
" he denies it , " @entity42 said			0
" i 'm sure he 'll enter a not guilty plea			0
" @entity42 said he was disappointed in the information contained in what he called a brief indictment			0
" we 'd like information about what he 's supposed to have done , " he said			0
" you 'd think after 7Â½ years they 'd have a little more to say			0
" the most important thing to him is he now has some definition of his future			0
before , he did n't know if he 'd be charged , be repatriated or held forever			2
" the decision by the @entity28 administration to criminally charge @entity12 after he spent seven years in custody -- more than five years in @entity45 -- is the latest twist in the ongoing legal saga of the only remaining " enemy combatant " held in the @entity6			1
he had been accused of being an @entity11 sleeper agent , but until this indictment he had never been charged with a criminal or terrorism - related offense			1
he will be transferred at some point to @entity75 , @entity14 , to face a criminal trial			0
oral arguments in the case are scheduled april 27			0
a @entity24 official said the @entity80 will release an official presidential order to transfer @entity12 into civilian custody			1
@entity35 's lawyer applauded the move			0
" this indictment is an important step toward restoring the rule of law and is exactly what should happen when the government suspects an individual of terrorist acts			0
this case is now finally where it belongs : in a legitimate court that can fairly determine whether mr. @entity12 is guilty of a crime , " said @entity94 , an @entity95 attorney who is representing him in the pending high court appeal			2
president @entity28 last month ordered a prompt and thorough review of the " factual and legal basis " for the continued detention of @entity12			1
@entity28 late friday issued a presidential memorandum ordering secretary of defense @entity104 to facilitate @entity12 's transfer , calling it " in the interest of the @entity6			2
" since his initial arrest on credit card fraud charges in december 2001 , @entity12 , a 43 - year - old legal resident of the @entity6 , has remained in " virtual isolation in the brig , " his attorneys said			1
they were suing the government to improve his jail conditions and are challenging the constitutionality of his detention			0
they said his cell at the brig in @entity45 is only 9 feet by 6 feet and he is allowed little contact with the outside world , including his family			0
the case posed a sticky legal dilemma for the high court and the current and previous administrations			0
president @entity128 ordered @entity12 confined in military custody , and the @entity130 had been filing the appeals opposing @entity12 's legal claims			1
at issue was whether the @entity134 , passed by @entity135 after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , gave the president the power to order the indefinite military detention of an accused terrorist seized on domestic soil			1
@entity35 arrived in the @entity6 the day before the 2001 terrorist attacks as a computer science graduate student at @entity13 in @entity75			2
he had earned an undergraduate degree there a decade earlier			0
weeks later , he was arrested after authorities found hundreds of credit card numbers belonging to others in his home			2
at an early court hearing , a prosecutor said @entity12 was believed to be an associate of @entity11 , the @entity153 terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks			1
the case against @entity12 escalated when investigators further examined his computer and interrogated @entity11 detainees , the government said			1
although @entity12 was not charged with terrorism - related offenses , @entity128 in june 2003 issued a formal declaration naming him an " enemy combatant " and transferring him to military custody			1
that move sent him out of the normal criminal justice system into indefinite military detention			0
the declaration alleges @entity12 engaged in " hostile and warlike acts " working as an " @entity11 sleeper agent " who was planning to " hack into the computer systems of @entity6 banks , " for a possible follow - up to the 9/11 attacks			1
the @entity173 said he had trained at a terror camp in @entity175 , met @entity11 leaders @entity177 and @entity178 and " volunteered for a martyr mission , " according to the government 's filing with the high court			2
a lawyer for @entity184 , an @entity6 citizen detained as an enemy combatant , said the government 's actions in the @entity12 case echo those in @entity188 's , in which he says criminal charges were filed shortly before the case was to go to the @entity15			1
" this is deja vu all over again -- what the @entity128 administration did with @entity188 , the @entity28 administration is trying to do with @entity12 , " he said			1
" transferring @entity12 out of the brig is the right thing to do			2
moving to dismiss the case is not			0
" the case is @entity6 v. @entity12 ( 09 - @entity200 - 10030 )			2
