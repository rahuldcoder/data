@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's more to wearing the " niqab " -- the austere , all - covering veil favored by ultra-religious @entity7 women -- than meets the eye			1
@entity10 students wearing niqab stand outside a university dormitory on oct. 7 unable to enter due to the new rules preventing admission to niqab wearers			1
a recent declaration by a leading @entity1 cleric that women will not be allowed to wear the niqab in university areas frequented only by women has sparked demonstrations by female students in @entity0 determined to wear the all - encompassing veil wherever they go			1
@entity1 's @entity26 , the highest seat of @entity28 , recently convened an all - male committee to rule on what women can wear at @entity1 's public universities			1
the @entity33 of @entity26 , @entity34 , announced after the meeting that a ban on the niqab , also known as the burqa , would apply to such university areas as female dormitories and all - women classes			1
do you think @entity7 women should wear the niqab ? tell us below in the @entity47 box even though that was a step down from a statement he made earlier that the niqab would be banned in all public universities , his ruling sparked controversy with the growing number of women in the country who choose to stay covered			1
the initiative from @entity26 is seen by many in @entity1 as an attempt to counter the growing appeal of the strictest interpretations of @entity28			1
an increasing number of young women in @entity1 are turning to the niqab			1
the niqab is worn by many @entity7 women throughout the @entity71 world and beyond and is most common in the countries of @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and the @entity79			1
it is also commonly worn in @entity81			2
" the niqab should be worn under two circumstances , " a cleaning lady who works at @entity26 , told @entity2 recently			2
" a very beautiful woman should wear it to prevent men from fighting over her , and an ugly woman should wear it to hide her face			0
" there is no consensus among @entity7 scholars regarding the wearing of the niqab , the piece of cloth that covers a @entity7 woman 's face			1
women who wear it usually also cover their hands			1
it is widely believed to be a tradition that comes from the @entity104 , introduced to more liberal countries like @entity1 by people who have lived and worked in ultra-conservative countries like @entity73			0
there 's not much about it in the @entity110 , @entity7 's holy book			1
the @entity110 verse that applies to female head covering translates loosely as : " @entity113 ! tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies			2
" and so consequently , there are plenty of interpretations			0
and all sorts of opinions in the @entity1 parliament			0
the opposition - led @entity126 opposes the niqab ban			1
" it 's unacceptable that the niqab is treated as something bad that needs to be suppressed , " @entity126 member of parliament @entity129 told @entity2			2
" it 's unacceptable to violate private matters in this way			0
" in @entity139 's opinion , it 's a matter of personal choice and should not be dictated by the shaikh of @entity26			0
appointed by the president of @entity1 , the shaikh of @entity26 is viewed as little more than an appendage of the authoritarian @entity1 government , and thus scorned as a state puppet by both religious and secular critics of the regime			0
since the 1960s the shaikh of @entity26 has been appointed by the @entity1 president			0
in @entity151 , wearing the niqab has become a controversial issue too			2
recently , @entity154 president @entity153 banned it from @entity154 classrooms			0
and @entity158 justice minister @entity157 also recently asked women to remove them in his consituency office			2
in @entity0 's main shopping district , the message on the niqab is decidedly mixed			2
the few niqabs on display are vastly outnumbered by far more risque outfits , including no shortage of mannequins sporting evening dressings with plunging necklines and naked arms			0
there are a few niqabs on display , but lots of less conservative clothing is on the shelves too			0
outside @entity10 , some women go without any head covering at all			2
most wear headscarves -- usually quite colorful ones			0
those who choose to wear the niqab say the religious scholars should have asked a woman what she thought of the ban first			1
" he should have taken at least one woman 's opinion , " said student @entity189			0
" because the decision will impact on her			0
" @entity194 contributed to this story .			0
