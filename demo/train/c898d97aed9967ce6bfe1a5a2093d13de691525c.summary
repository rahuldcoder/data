@entity0 -- the @entity2 met monday to consider the @entity4 ' bid for full membership in the world body and decided to meet again wednesday morning , when they will send the matter to the admissions committee , said @entity2 president @entity9 of @entity10			1
@entity9 said the decision was made to take the matter to the committee as required by @entity14 59 of the @entity0 ' rules of procedure			2
" so , we have to wait until wednesday morning , " he said outside the @entity2			1
though the debate is expected to be largely symbolic in the face of a promised @entity22 veto , the permanent observer of the @entity18 to the @entity0 , @entity17 , held out hope prior to monday 's @entity2 meeting that the bid would be accepted			1
" we hope that the @entity2 will shoulder its responsibility and address this application with a positive attitude , especially since we have 139 countries that have recognized the state of @entity33 so far , meaning more than two - thirds majority , " he said			1
" we are ready to govern ourselves			0
" @entity18 president @entity35 made the bid for the @entity0 to recognize an independent state of @entity33 on friday , a move @entity39 says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns			1
@entity35 drew applause when the @entity18 leader raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the @entity49			1
the time has come for a " @entity51 " to join the @entity52 in reshaping the @entity53 , he said			0
" my people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity			0
" but @entity39 prime minister @entity59 , later taking his turn to address the @entity49 , said @entity4 are looking for a " state without peace , " ignoring security concerns important to @entity39			1
he said @entity4 are armed not only with their " hopes and dreams , " a phrase @entity35 had used in his speech , but with " 10,000 missiles , and grad rockets supplied by @entity67 , not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into @entity70			0
" " palestinians should first make peace with @entity39 and then get their state , " he said , adding that peace must arrive through a two - state solution that recognizes @entity39 as a jewish state			1
if that occurs , @entity39 " will be the first " to recognize @entity18 statehood , the prime minister said			1
@entity35 ' move prompted a call from the @entity53 " quartet " for new peace talks intended to come up with a breakthrough by the end of next year			0
representatives from the @entity0 , the @entity22 , @entity88 and the @entity89 discussed the request friday and issued a statement saying the bid is before the @entity2			1
the group called for a " preparatory meeting " to take place within one month to outline how peace might be negotiated			0
each side would then be tasked with producing a comprehensive proposal on territory and security issues within three months and " to have made substantial progress with six months , " the statement said			0
@entity35 ' speech provoked cheers and chants from flag - waving @entity4 who watched the address on a big - screen television in a square in @entity109 , the @entity110			0
his speech was closely watched across the @entity53			0
the hundreds who gathered in @entity109 greeted the news that he had formally filed the request with cheers , song and dance			2
demonstrations took place friday in @entity121 and in cities across the @entity53 as demonstrators waved @entity18 flags and chanted slogans in shows of solidarity			2
on friday , a @entity4 was killed and 17 were wounded in clashes with @entity39 settlers and @entity39 forces in the village of @entity133 , @entity18 officials reported			1
the @entity134 said they had gone to the village after receiving a report that settlers and @entity4 were hurling stones at each other ; when they arrived , about 300 @entity4 began attacking the @entity134 soldiers , who responded with riot - control methods and live fire			0
the @entity134 said it was investigating the incident			0
also friday , an @entity39 man and his year - old son were killed when their car drove off the road near the settlement of @entity150			2
the @entity39 police and @entity134 initially treated the incident as a routine road accident , but an examination of the body has led them to reassess that view			2
" we confirmed he had been injured as a result of being struck in the head , which probably caused him to lose control of the car ; this indicates to us the strong possibility that he was struck by @entity18 stone throwers in an act of terrorism , " police spokesman @entity156 said			2
the @entity18 's @entity171 , which records violent acts by settlers against @entity4 , said the number of violent incidents rose between september 18 and24			2
the ministry cited an incident in @entity133 , where olive trees were set afire and stones thrown at cars carrying @entity4			0
@entity22 president @entity180 has said he supports @entity18 statehood but reiterated a longstanding @entity22 position that @entity39 must be part of the discussions			1
while a @entity22 veto would block the bid for full @entity0 membership , the @entity49 could still vote to upgrade the status of @entity4 , who currently hold the status of non-voting observer " entity			1
" the body could change that status to permanent observer " state , " identical to the @entity198 's standing at the @entity0			0
@entity199 , the dominant of two @entity18 political groups , has maintained that neither a @entity0 application nor direct negotiations with @entity39 would provide the @entity18 people " with what they 're looking for			1
" " @entity35 ' emotional speech succeeded in moving people 's feelings , but his description of @entity18 suffering is different from reality , " said @entity199 spokesman @entity206			2
@entity199 controls @entity70 , while @entity35 ' @entity214 organization holds the @entity110			0
@entity1 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			0

" we have to wait until wednesday morning , " @entity2 president says
the @entity22 vows to veto the @entity18 request
@entity39 says negotiations are the only way forward
