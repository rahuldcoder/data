-- @entity1 sue us next ? not a chance			2
that 's the gist of @entity6 's message following @entity1 's $ 1 billion victory over @entity8 in a @entity10 patent suit			1
the search giant is doing its best to quell fears that its android operating system could be the next target for @entity1 's lawyers			1
and you ca n't blame them			0
@entity6 has to do something to keep its partners in the smartphone and tablet world from panicking , to say nothing of investors			0
but experts say that while the @entity1 v. @entity8 suit did n't describe a legal route that leads directly to @entity29 , @entity6 had better watch its back			1
@entity1 v. @entity8 ripped apart both the hardware and software used in @entity8 's very popular smartphones and tablets			2
arguments hinged on whether certain hardware features -- like a bezeled display and a lozenge - shaped earpiece -- had been ripped off from @entity1 by @entity8 's designers			2
a jury decided that in multiple instances they had			0
@entity1 also filed claims that @entity8 developed operating system features that violated @entity1 patents			2
@entity8 licenses @entity6 's @entity46 operating system for its tablets and phones , and makes changes to personalize the user experience			1
those small changes include pinch - to - zoom , tap - to - zoom , and bounce - back features , which fall under @entity1 - owned utility patents			2
@entity6 , which has stayed silent about the case until now , said monday that these utility patent features are n't part of the core @entity46 operating system , which runs underneath @entity8 's and other device manufacturer 's modifications			1
@entity6 gives its licensees a plain , stock version of the @entity46 operating system , which by itself does not violate @entity1 's patents			1
however , licensees can modify the @entity46 system and build any feature they like , and those features could violate other patented technologies			1
here 's @entity6 's full statement in reaction to the verdict : " the court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims			2
most of these do n't relate to the core @entity46 operating system , and several are being re-examined by the @entity82			1
the mobile industry is moving fast and all players -- including newcomers -- are building upon ideas that have been around for decades			0
we work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products , and we do n't want anything to limit that			0
" @entity93 , an intellectual property attorney with national law firm @entity94 , says @entity6 's statement is a message to its partners that the verdict only applies to @entity8 's products , and not the entire @entity46 ecosystem			1
" it 's essentially @entity6 saying that the patent issues apply to @entity8 's software changes and @entity8 's hardware , but not to ' core ' @entity46 or other @entity46 products , " says @entity93			1
looking at the case , @entity107 law professor @entity106 says @entity6 is focusing on distancing itself from the pinch - to - zoom , the tap - to - zoom , and the bounce - back features that @entity8 created , saying they are n't included in its base @entity46 code			1
" @entity6 's claim is that those features are part of the modified experience from other companies that license the @entity46 operating system , " says @entity114			1
analysts agree with @entity6 's stance , saying there is no evidence out there that the core @entity46 operating system has infringed on @entity1 or any other company 's patents			1
but @entity6 has yet to endure the scrutiny of a full - blown patent suit			0
the @entity10 jury was looking at what @entity8 did or did n't do , not what @entity6 did or did n't do			0
that 's a key distinction			0
but if @entity6 has its way , no jury will ever test its claims			0
@entity6 has gone to great lengths to keep its operating system distinct from @entity139 with widgets , rotary and pull - tab lock screens , and an applications menu separate from the home screen			0
all very un-apple - like design flourishes			0
even @entity6 's @entity146 hardware line , made with @entity8 , @entity147 , and @entity148 , includes designs with rounded corners , curved screens , and textured battery covers that could never be mistaken for an @entity1 device			1
still @entity6 is not immune to a patent lawsuit , even though it would n't be easy for @entity1 -- or anyone else -- to bring a case			1
one of the chief reasons @entity1 has n't yet gone after @entity6 , @entity114 says , is because @entity6 does n't make any money from selling the @entity46 ( it makes money from mobile ads )			1
since @entity6 is giving away @entity46 , it makes it hard for @entity1 to prove that the operating system harms its market share			1
" that does n't mean @entity1 could n't sue @entity6 , it just makes it more challenging to prove the direct impact , " says @entity114			2
" that 's why @entity1 's gone the indirect route , by suing device manufacturers that can modify @entity46			1
" and it 's not inconceivable that @entity1 eventually decides to go directly after @entity6 , @entity114 says			2
if it gets on a winning streak in @entity172 courts against the rest of the handset makers , it might take a shot			0
" this is act 1 in a multi-act play , " says @entity114			0
" @entity1 is on the record saying they want to destroy the @entity46 ecosystem , and to do that it 's either going have to go after the all the software makers , or every single hardware manufacturer that sells these things			2
" whether its @entity1 going after its next victim , or the @entity8 case going to appeal , @entity93 agrees there is a long way to go			0
" patent litigation takes place on at least three fronts â € ” the district court , the patent office and the federal circuit , " he says			2
" what we 've had so far is just the district court 's ruling and we have n't even heard from the @entity198 on this yet			0
so this process is far from over			0
" the legal process perhaps , but as is the case in the fast - moving tech world , the design process has already moved on			0
pick up the latest @entity8 smartphone and you wo n't see the hardware or software features that the jury found violated @entity1 's patents			1
@entity8 has learned its lesson , albeit in a very expensive way			0
@entity6 already has a tight grip on @entity46 , and you 're likely to see that grip tighten as it looks to avoid any of its own patent litigation woes			1
the good news for consumers is that rather than waiting for jury verdicts in the future , there 's a good chance we 'll be waiting for the next crop of smartphones and tablets with forms and features that are distinct -- not just a bunch of @entity1 copycats			0
