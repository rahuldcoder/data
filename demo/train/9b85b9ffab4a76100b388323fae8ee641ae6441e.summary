-- " @entity1 " is an absolute joy			0
the much - anticipated sequel expands on and improves the original 's dark humor and mind - bending puzzles while providing a story that twists , turns and answers questions previously unasked			1
a follow - up to the 2007 surprise smash hit " portal , " the game , released tuesday by @entity15 , puts you back in the test chambers at @entity18 many years after the events of the first game end			1
you play again as @entity22 , a female test subject who has been in stasis for many centuries and once again finds herself trying to escape from the treacherous lab. this time , you 're aided early on by a robot ball named @entity27 , who wants to get out as well			0
however , you are eventually reunited with @entity31 ( @entity32 and @entity33 ) , the homicidal computer from " portal " that you presumably destroyed but is now seeking revenge -- in the name of science			1
game play once again features a series of platform - based puzzles that require the use of the portal gun to traverse			1
the gun fires two types of portals that allow the player to get to hard - to - reach places			0
not every surface can be used as a portal , so proper selection of targets is key to advancing in the game			1
the @entity53 and @entity53 , a small box with hearts on the side , are back to help with weighted triggers			2
there are also @entity58 that contain lenses to deflect laser beams , or @entity61 as they are called in the game 's deliciously ominous double - speak			2
the puzzles require logical thinking and are smartly done			2
if you did n't play the first game , " @entity1 " does start with some basic puzzles to help you understand how the game 's physics , mechanics and portals work			1
but the difficulty ramps up quickly after a few test rooms			0
there are some new elements to help work out the puzzles			2
" @entity84 " launch you and other objects around the room and often help in adding momentum , which is sometimes critical to get to hard - to - reach places without a portal			0
liquid gels become available later in the game ; they provide some useful abilities			2
a blue gel helps @entity22 bounce , and an orange gel boosts her speed			0
a white gel can be used to cover walls or floors that normally ca n't be used as portals , allowing one to be created			0
there are puzzles that will require one , two or all three gels to complete			2
all of these additions to the puzzle - solving make for a very intelligent game			2
it is often best when entering a new room to stop , take a look around and analyze the scene			0
be sure to look in all directions , because the way out may force to you to go in a different direction than the obvious one			0
the story is fantastic , and the writing and dialogue remain one of the cornerstones to this series			1
@entity31 's voice is dripping with sarcasm and malice even as her tone remains soothing and calm			1
@entity27 is silly , frantic and almost childlike			0
the humor remains dark and dangerous , as it was in " portal			1
" @entity31 often lies about pressing concerns or dangers , then admits her lie and seems to revel in the deception			1
without giving away any story spoilers , the game is pretty much divided into three parts and introduces the ceo and founder of @entity18 , @entity135			2
@entity135 was heard in promotional videos for the game and has a sarcastic , shoot - from - the - hip attitude that just adds to the great dialogue found throughout " @entity1			1
" the single - player version takes about six to eight hours to play depending on how fast you can solve the mind - bending puzzles			2
but the action does n't stop there			0
" @entity1 " offers a co-op version for two players , each operating a robot with a portal gun			0
@entity31 puts @entity151 and @entity152 , the two bots , through test rooms much like @entity22 had to experience			1
it is truly a cooperative game that ca n't be mastered by just one person			2
the puzzles are more complex , since they do require cooperation , but the devices and mechanics remain the same as in single - player mode			1
@entity152 can communicate by using indicators to suggest what needs to be moved or where a portal should go			0
they can also gesture to one another for a wave , a hug or even a high - five after a job well done			0
a random partner can be found online , but it is infinitely more enjoyable to play with someone in the same room or with a friend			0
these puzzles can take some time to solve if you 've never seen them before , and a friend might be more willing to cut you some slack as you analyze your options			0
there is no drop - in or drop - out during co-op play			0
if one player leaves the game , the session is disconnected , creating another reason to play with someone you know			0
@entity31 keeps up the sarcasm but , if possible , shows even less empathy for the robots			1
her dialogue , of course , remains funny and brutal			0
@entity201 players can play each other across the @entity204 network			0
steam , the online gaming platform , is supported on the @entity206 as well as pc and @entity209 computers , so players on those platforms also can play co-op with one another			1
" portal 2 " was released tuesday morning , although a steam promotion gave gamers the chance to play the game monday night by purchasing a package of independently produced games			1
overall , " @entity1 " is a sublime game from start to finish , with humor , wit , intelligence and drama carried over from the debut title			1
the action remains fresh and original , and the dialogue spurs spontaneous laughter even in the deadliest situations			1
and in case you were wondering ... there is no cake			0
" @entity1 " is available now for the @entity201 , @entity206 , pc and @entity209 the game is rated @entity239 + due to fantasy violence and mild language			1
this review was done playing the single - player version on @entity201 and the co-op version on @entity206 and @entity237 ( through @entity245 ) .			1

the dark humor and tricky puzzles are back from the original , as is the twisted @entity31
writing and dialogue remain a cornerstone of the series
game was released tuesday for @entity256 , @entity206 , @entity237 and @entity209
the cake ? still a lie
