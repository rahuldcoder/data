in 2010 , @entity0 discharged a firearm in the direction of her estranged husband , @entity4 -- a so - called " warning shot " that missed him by several inches			1
their two children were present			2
although no one was injured , she was charged with aggravated assault with a firearm			2
@entity12 claimed self - defense , but a judge declined to grant self - defense immunity ( " stand - your - ground " )			0
the case went to trial where a jury convicted @entity12 after just 12 minutes of deliberation , triggering a mandatory 20 - year sentence			1
the verdict prompted outrage as it highlighted the absurdly draconian punishments that can result from minimum mandatory sentencing guidelines that demand a certain punishment regardless of the underlying facts of the case			1
the stakes in this high - profile case elevated when , in 2013 , an appellate court vacated @entity12 's conviction based on a legal technicality			1
the ruling set the stage for a retrial , but this time , state attorney @entity37 ( the same prosecutor i faced in the @entity40 case ) upped the ante , insisting the 20 - year sentence apply once for every person present -- @entity44 and the two children			1
@entity12 faced a potential 60 - year prison sentence for firing a shot that harmed no one			0
last month , @entity12 accepted a deal whereby she pled guilty to the charges in exchange for a drastic reduction of the prison sentence -- essentially the three years she had already served			0
this week , the court approved the sentencing			1
but to say that @entity0 is free is a misnomer			1
she 'll serve another two years under house arrest , wearing an ankle collar			0
she 's also a convicted felon , so she 's lost her right to vote and she 'll face the stigma of such a designation for the rest of her life			0
many are left wondering if justice was served			0
@entity0 's case had some problems			1
in order to justify her self - defense claim , @entity12 needed to show that she had reasonable fear of imminent and great bodily injury or death when she discharged the weapon			1
her estranged husband , @entity4 , did have a history of domestic violence			0
and there was testimony that he was violent in his encounter with @entity12 just before the shooting			0
the problem for @entity12 , however , was that she escaped the danger by retreating into the garage			0
there , she took the gun from the glove compartment of her car and she re-entered the house , engaged @entity4 , and fired the weapon			0
it 's what we lawyers call " imperfect self - defense			0
" the " stand - your - ground " statute removes the duty to retreat from a threat , but it does not allow you to retreat , arm yourself , and come back			0
the @entity12 case provides an excellent example of how an " imperfect " self - defense argument can have devastating and disproportionate consequences			1
because the jury did not accept @entity12 's self - defense argument , they had to convict			0
what they probably did n't realize ( because in @entity111 juries are n't told the sentences attached to their verdicts ) is that they triggered @entity111 's @entity115 mandatory sentencing requirement			1
in @entity111 , a person who uses a gun in the commission of certain felonies ( including aggravated assault ) must face minimum mandatory sentencing			1
if the gun is possessed during the commission of one of the enumerated felonies , a minimum 10 - year sentence is required			0
if the gun was discharged , as it was in this case , it is 20 years			2
@entity111 's minimum mandatory sentences are served day - per - day ; there is no early release			2
it might be appropriate to impose minimum mandatories on violent felons who use guns to further the commission of a crime such as armed robbery			0
the idea , however , that @entity111 does not allow any discretion -- even judicial discretion -- for more complicated scenarios truly makes it difficult to adjudicate these cases			0
had @entity12 taken this case to trial and again been convicted , the state indicated that they would seek a 60 - year minimum mandatory sentence			1
while the law allowed for such , it would have been an absurd result			0
we rely on judges to assist in dispensing justice , and to be the arbiter between the state and the defense			0
while the legislature has the absolute right to make laws , it should not hamstring a judge 's ability to dispense appropriate justice under the specific circumstances of individual cases			2
when a judge faces a minimum mandatory sentence , her hands are tied , she becomes a mathematician rather than a dispenser of justice			2
if the facts and the law support a harsh sentence , a judge has the discretion to impose it , but we should not force their hands when minimum mandatories produce obviously unjust sentences			1
more troubling yet is that the threat of such an absurd punishment clearly dissuaded @entity12 from seeking a second jury trial			2
had the statute been written in such a way to allow for a judge or jury to consider whether or a minimum mandatory sentence should apply , then the case could have been adjudicated on its merits			1
instead , @entity12 did what she had to do under the present statutory scheme -- plead and avoid risking a virtual life sentence where she would have died in prison			0
minimum mandatory sentencing takes discretion away from judges and gives it to prosecutors			1
while it is appropriate for prosecutors to have discretion over who they prosecute and what charges they pursue , minimum mandatory sentencing gives them a power that can be too easily abused			1
prosecutors can use the threat of extreme minimum mandatory sentences to strong - arm defendants into plea deals			2
this is what happened in the @entity12 case , and it compromised her right to due process simply because the risk was too great to chance a conviction at trial			2
minimum mandatory laws are politically popular with " tough - on - crime " advocates			1
but the " tough - on - crime " flag waving that makes for great talking points during an election ignores the day - to - day difficult realities judges and defense attorneys face , as well as the effect it has on the lives of the people who get caught in the system			0
this is not a call to go light on crime ; this a call to be reasonable about sentencing			1
we can keep our tough sentencing guidelines , but we need to let our judges be judges			2
we need to eliminate minimum mandatory sentencing laws .			1

minimal mandatory sentencing laws demand harsh punishment regardless of the facts of a case
@entity253 : the case of @entity0 shows the need for the laws to be more reasonable
