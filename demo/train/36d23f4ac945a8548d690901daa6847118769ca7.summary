@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sham marriage trial of @entity5 actress @entity4 , under way in a @entity0 federal court , offered more drama this week than the soap operas she is famous for			1
the courtroom cast included celebrity photographer and reality tv star @entity12 , whom defense lawyers tried to paint as a revengeful ex-boyfriend who turned her in to immigrations agents			1

the 28 - year - old actress - model began sobbing as @entity12 testified against her wednesday , outlining his romantic relationship with @entity4 that he said began after she married @entity20			1
the judge scowled several times as the lead defense attorney questioned @entity12 about areas already ruled irrelevant to the case			2
" please , do n't do that , " @entity22 district judge @entity36 warned defense lawyer @entity37			2
@entity40 's rulings frustrated defense efforts to press @entity12 about why he hired the private investigator who dug up the evidence that prompted immigration agents to begin their probe of @entity4 's marriage			1
@entity12 testified that it was " completely incorrect " that his motivation was to get his former girlfriend deported			2
instead , the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against @entity53 , the founder and owner of the @entity56 fashion company , @entity12 said			0
the criminal complaint named @entity53 as a target of the federal investigation , alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while @entity4 was modeling for his company			2
@entity12 said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared @entity12 might by extorted by @entity53			0
" my case has never been against @entity4 , " @entity12 said after his testimony			1
" i wish her the best			0
" the judge also rejected the defense attempt to allege that @entity12 , a @entity69 native , was himself involved in a sham marriage in 1987 -- a charge he denied outside court			1
" the defense attempted over and over again to taint mr. @entity12 with malicious and false smears , " said @entity12 's lawyer , @entity73			1
" the judge repeatedly blocked them from doing so by sustaining multiple objections to their improper questions			0
" the prosecutor in the case , assistant u.s. attorney @entity82 , said @entity4 could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted , though such cases usually produce shorter sentences			0
the case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases			0
the federal complaint accuses @entity4 of paying @entity20 , 28 , to marry her june 12 , 2005 , but alleges that they never lived together as a couple			0
@entity4 began dating @entity12 a month later , and they lived together for several months , the complaint says			2
according to a sworn affidavit by @entity98 senior special agent @entity99 filed in the case , @entity12 and @entity4 's relationship ended in 2007 , about the same time @entity12 filed a lawsuit against @entity56 and ball , alleging breach of contract in relation to a photo shoot			1
