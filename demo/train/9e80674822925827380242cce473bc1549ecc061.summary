@entity0 -- scientists have picked a prime landing site on the " head " of a comet for the next stage of the @entity8 mission			1
the project , led by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) with partners including @entity12 , recently placed the @entity8 probe in an orbit 30km ( 18 miles ) from the surface of @entity16 after a 10 - year chase across the solar system			1
if successful , the mission will be the first to orbit and land on a comet as it journeys around the @entity24 a statement on the space agency 's @entity8 blog says landing site " @entity34 " was chosen due to its " scientific potential " while posing less risk to @entity8 's lander module @entity32 compared to other possible sites			1
a backup site ( marked " c " in the above composite image ) has been identified on the irregularly - shaped " body " of the comet which has two distinct lobes -- and mission controllers say they are aiming to reach the surface on november 11			2
@entity8 will stay in orbit around the comet as it rushes towards the @entity24 , taking measurements as gas and dust are ejected into a huge tail , while the lander carries out experiments on the surface			2
the mission is aimed at learning more about the composition of comets and the project may shed light on whether they brought water to @entity57 or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life			0
3d animation : see how @entity8 met the comet " we will make the first ever in situ analysis of a comet at this site , giving us an unparalleled insight into the composition , structure and evolution of a comet , " said a lead lander scientist @entity63 on @entity10 's @entity8 website			1
making a landing is particularly difficult as the probes are so far away that steering @entity32 once it has separated from @entity8 is not possible			1
the lander 's trajectory has to be programmed ahead of its release			0
project leaders had to find a landing site that avoids large surface hazards and allows @entity32 to continue to communicate with @entity8			1
before the prime landing site was chosen , @entity8 project scientist @entity81 also explained that power was a crucial consideration			1
@entity32 's batteries will have enough charge for 64 hours but the lander needs sunlight to generate more energy for the extended science mission			2
" there are certain parts of the comet where you wo n't be able to do any science because you will never get the lander in enough sunlight to be able to recharge the batteries , " @entity81 told @entity1			0
@entity81 shared the excitement of seeing the first high - resolution close - up images but said his reaction to the odd shape was : " what are we going to do with this ? where are we going to go ? " it has presented a challenge as to where we can land on the comet because there are certain regions you just ca n't reach			0
the neck is quite difficult to get to -- it 's difficult to get a trajectory that will end up on that point without clipping one of the lobes			0
" @entity81 told @entity1 that results were starting to come in from the on - board instruments			0
" there are some dust instruments that kind of put their hand up for a couple of weeks and then bring the hand back in again and analyze what it 's caught , " he said			0
" we are starting to sniff and taste the comet			0
" you can follow @entity8 's mission on @entity133 @ @entity134 and through the @entity10 blog .			2

scientists are trying to land a probe on @entity140 - @entity139
the @entity10 says it now has chosen a prime target landing site
the comet is so far from @entity57 the @entity32 lander needs to be programed to land on its own
it took more than 10 years to position the @entity8 craft so it could follow the comet
