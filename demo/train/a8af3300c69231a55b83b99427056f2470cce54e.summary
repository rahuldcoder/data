@entity0 -- in the words of judge @entity4 , the situation is " dire			2
" from her chambers in @entity7 , @entity8 , the chief judge of federal judicial district of @entity8 warns a bulging criminal caseload is being exacerbated by three unfilled bench seats , which the @entity14 administration and the @entity15 have , until recently , shown little urgency to address			1
" we have a crisis , we have vacancies , and we would like to have them filled so that justice can be served , " she told @entity1 in an exclusive television interview			1
the crisis was thrust suddenly upon the 64 - year - old @entity8 native			1
the murder of her predecessor , chief judge @entity27 in the january 8 @entity30 shootings that left rep. @entity31 seriously wounded suddenly put her in charge			1
losing a colleague and dear friend , while ensuring her court continued to do its job remains a personal and professional challenge for @entity4 , but she remains quietly confident			1
" we are doing our job , " she said			2
" that 's what we were appointed to do and we will continue to do , and i ca n't imagine anything falling apart here			2
" a nationwide dilemma the situation in @entity8 is mirrored nationwide , caused by a combination of practical and political forces			2
the importance of the federal courts is not lost on the ever - rising number of civil and criminal litigants seeking justice , and on the issue advocacy groups that have made the appointment of judges a political rallying cry			1
that has led to delays of up to 19 months in getting some nominees confirmed			2
" government is now not doing it 's job , that 's what it comes down to , it 's just not filling these vacancies in a timely manner and there 's enough blame to go around , " said @entity59 , a policy analyst with the @entity60			1
" i think it 's going to be harder and harder to get people , good people to be federal judges because who wants to go through this process ? " in @entity8 , a state with the third highest criminal caseload in the country , the vacancies have left the remaining three @entity30 - based judges handling more than 1200 criminal cases each			1
" and then of course they have civil cases on top of that , " said @entity77			2
" and i just learned recently that @entity83 was carrying about 150 civil cases			2
" based on its caseload , the judicial district of @entity8 is eligible for five additional judgeships			1
there are now 92 vacancies in the 857 federal district and appeals court judgeships , amounting to about 11 %			1
just 61 names have been currently put forth by president @entity14 in the new @entity94 , many of them renominated -- but never confirmed -- from the past two years			1
seventeen candidates have received confirmation since january			2
the @entity99 of the @entity101 courts predicts at least 23 more vacancies this year			1
since @entity14 took office in 2009 , the number of open slots has risen steadily , as judges retire or leave for better - paying jobs			1
the president has been slow to replace them , compared to his two predecessors			1
in their first two years , @entity111 had a 90 % confirmation rate for his nominees , while @entity115 had a 77 % rate			2
@entity14 by contrast has only had 58 % of his 103 choices clearing the @entity15 hurdle			1
his supporters point to a number of factors for the slow start -- including two time - consuming @entity125 vacancies in the past two years			1
yet @entity127 aides proudly note the diversity the president has brought to his nominees : about three - fourths are women or minorities , with a particular focus on @entity135			1
by contrast , the current federal bench remains almost 60 % white male			1
@entity125 choices almost always receive relatively swift attention			2
@entity14 's two choices -- @entity142 and @entity143 -- took their judicial oaths less than three months after being chosen			1
some lower court nominees by contrast nominated in 2009 by the president have yet to get a final vote			1
@entity59 from the @entity60 and other court watchers point the finger at all sides : a delinquent @entity127 , stall tactics from conservative @entity155 senators , and an ever - increasing chorus from interest groups on the left and right			1
" both parties may have an institutional reason to get this back to a situation it was before , " said @entity59 , " where the government could fulfill a basic government function , which is filling judicial vacancies			1
" there is some hope of that happening			0
seven judgeships have been approved in the past month by senators , including two this week			1
several more nominees have been promised floor votes in coming days			0
government sources say senate majority leader @entity176 , @entity177 , and minority leader @entity178 , @entity179 , reached an informal agreement earlier this year not to use the same procedural maneuvers that have delayed many judicial nominees over the past few years			1
most nominees , said sources , will get up - or - down votes in " an orderly fashion			0
the @entity187 resumes confirmation hearings wednesday , with perhaps the most contentious nominee getting another shot			0
@entity192 law professor @entity191 has been tapped to sit on the @entity193			0
his outspoken opposition to many of the legal policies and judicial nominees of the second @entity115 administration has earned him conservative wrath			0
if confirmed he would be only the second current @entity200 on the federal appeals bench , and many liberals see @entity191 as a potential candidate for the @entity125 someday			1
cause and effect the sagging economy has rippled into the federal courts , with ever - increasing bankruptcy filings and civil , financial disputes			1
current legal fights over national security , health care reform , and " social " areas like gay marriage have only added to the bulging dockets			0
in the @entity0 , hundreds of appeals from terror suspects detained at the @entity219 military prison have overwhelmed that federal court			1
as a result , " we plan to try very few civil cases this spring and summer , " said chief judge @entity222			0
@entity0 's federal district court has three current judicial vacancies			1
@entity222 is unusually blunt about the situation , saying , " this is as bad as i 've seen it			0
" " there 's a war between the legislative branches of government and the judiciary is caught in the middle and we are suffering , " the 1987 @entity231 appointee told @entity1			0
" the @entity155 are doing exactly what they accused the @entity240 of before			0
they 're stalling and there 's no good basis to stall if you have no basis against the nominee			0
" some courts in some areas of the country report little or no backlog			2
other areas like the @entity251 see no relief			0
@entity253 has been anything but for those on the judicial front lines			0
the federal program launched in 2005 requires low - level criminal prosecution and imprisonment of nearly every illegal immigrant caught crossing parts of the @entity101 - @entity263 border			1
judges in the region report being swamped			0
" the border courts are absolutely overloaded , " said judge @entity266 , based in @entity267			2
" you 've got judges handling eight times the number of criminal cases than are normally registered in other courts across the nation			2
that 's a staggering docket			0
" the 1993 @entity111 appointee said some decisions by his border state colleagues are made " assembly line fashion , which i think we all find unacceptable			0
" @entity8 justice @entity4 said criminal prosecutions in her home state have risen by about 70 % in the past two years			0
so in january she declared a judicial " emergency " in @entity8 , giving her and her colleagues more time before defendants must face trial			0
essentially those criminal trials do not have to take place for 180 days as opposed to the @entity292 requirement of 70 days			0
it is a rarely used tactic , but @entity4 said she and her predecessor , @entity27 , had no choice			0
" he initiated the request for a declaration of the judicial emergency , " she said			0
after his sudden death , " i picked up the reins immediately and accomplished it			0
he put together all the statistics so all i did was update those statistics and now it has been accomplished			2
" roll in fact had gone to speak informally with rep. @entity31 at a @entity30 - area constituent gathering about the judicial emergency , when the shootings occurred			0
the 63 - year - old judge was caught in the crossfire			2
" well we were absolutely shocked and stunned and we 're still saddened , " said @entity4 , a 1994 @entity111 appointee			0
" the crisis occurred on january 8 , we went back to work on january 10			0
we did not lose any stride whatsoever			0
we are dealing with a crisis			0
we do our best not to think about it and let the sad news overcome us			0
" @entity1 's @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
