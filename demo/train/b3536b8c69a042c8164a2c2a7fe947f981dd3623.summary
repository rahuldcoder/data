ice island separated from the @entity13 in northern @entity7 early on thursday , researchers based at the @entity11 said			1
the ice island , which is about half the height of the @entity16 , is the biggest piece of ice to break away from the @entity20 icecap since 1962 and amounts to a quarter of the @entity22 70 - kilometer floating ice shelf , according to research leader @entity23			1
" the freshwater stored in this ice island could keep the @entity11 or @entity27 rivers flowing for more than two years			2
it could also keep all @entity9 public tap water flowing for 120 days , " @entity23 said			0
@entity23 's team is studying ice in the @entity32 separating @entity7 from @entity33 , about 1,000 kilometers south of the @entity34			1
satellite data from @entity39 's @entity38 - @entity37 satellite revealed the initial rupture which was confirmed within hours by @entity41 of the @entity42 , according to the @entity11 website			0
@entity23 said the island could block the @entity32 as it drifts south , or break into smaller islands and continue towards the open waters of the @entity47			0
" in @entity32 , the ice island will encounter real islands that are all much smaller in size , " he said			2
" the newly born ice island may become land - fast , block the channel , or it may break into smaller pieces as it is propelled south by the prevailing ocean currents			2
from there , it will likely follow along the coasts of @entity58 and @entity59 , to reach the @entity47 within the next two years			0
" environmentalists say ice melt is being caused by global warming with @entity20 temperatures in the 1990s reaching their warmest level of any decade in at least 2,000 years , according to a study published in 2009			1
current trends could see the @entity20 become ice free in summer months within decades , researchers predict .			0

260 square - kilometer ice island is biggest since 1962 , researchers say
ice broke away from @entity13 early on thursday
ice island could block @entity32 which separates @entity33 , @entity7
