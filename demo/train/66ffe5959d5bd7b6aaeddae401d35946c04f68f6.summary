@entity0 , @entity1 -- the shell of former @entity1 strongman @entity5 's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the @entity8 , but its radioactive legacy lingers on			1
the @entity0 research complex , about 18 kilometers ( 11 miles ) southeast of @entity11 , was bombed by @entity12 in its 1981 airstrike on @entity1 's tammuz 1 research reactor			1
it was bombed again during the @entity16 of 1991 , and it was looted extensively after the 2003 @entity18 invasion that ousted @entity5			2
now , engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site , but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work			0
" it is difficult because of the destruction , " said @entity26 , the project manager at @entity0			1
" this facility was bombed in 1991			0
now , finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities			2
" workers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility , where about 20 people are at work so far			0
@entity1 's @entity39 said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility , but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades			1
" we have 18 facilities in @entity0 , " said @entity43 , @entity1 's deputy science and technology minister			1
" we have another 10 facilities around the country			0
so you can imagine how long it will take			0
" @entity1 's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s , when it obtained a @entity53 - built research reactor			1
it built another , @entity56 - designed reactor in the 1970s			0
@entity12 's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid , in which @entity12 pilots flew across then - hostile @entity61 and a corner of @entity63 to strike the facility			0
despite the damage inflicted by that attack , @entity1 began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the @entity71 in the 1980s , the @entity18 - led @entity65 reported in 2004			1
it accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of @entity75 left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the @entity1 forces			2
the bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the @entity0 plants			2
the @entity83 sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced @entity5 's government to abandon its nuclear program , the @entity65 concluded			1
after the 2003 invasion , which was launched after the @entity18 incorrectly accused @entity1 of having restarted its nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs , nearby @entity1 inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility			1
villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness , particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water			0
the @entity65 found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings , and the @entity18 military later spent $ 70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as " yellowcake " -- to @entity107			0
some @entity1 scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future			2
but for now , @entity1 is still grappling with the shadow of its past .			0

complex at the *center* of @entity5 's nuclear efforts slowly being dismantled
@entity118 could take decades : @entity0 complex has 18 facilities
dismantling at @entity0 made more difficult because of bombing , looting
@entity1 began attempting to produce enriched uranium during the @entity71 in the 1980s
