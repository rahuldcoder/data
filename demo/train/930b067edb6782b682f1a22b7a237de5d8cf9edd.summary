-- even as the head of the @entity3 at @entity4 , @entity1 did n't have a lot of time for politics this primary season			2
immersed in tough pre-law classes at the conservative @entity11 university in @entity12 , @entity13 , she barely paid attention to the nonstop political ads that ran on tv during the state 's presidential primary			1
" classes are all - consuming for college students , " @entity1 said			1
" we do n't have a lot of time to watch tv			2
" what would have caught her attention ? ads sent directly to her smartphone			1
" i would definitely have clicked on an ad texted to me , " she said			1
" that 's a perfect way to reach college students			2
we always have our cellphones in our backpacks or in our hands			2
" that 's what digital political guru @entity38 was counting on when he sent the campus conservative - themed text ads for former house speaker @entity42 before the @entity13 primary			1
he says his ads typically said things like " stop @entity47 's @entity46 " or " @entity48			1
" some were as simple as " @entity50 , " with a clickable " @entity52 " button			2
" in the industry , @entity53 will tell you that a 0.2 or 0.3 % click - through rate for ads is considered successful , " @entity38 told @entity0			1
" with the @entity4 campaign i created , those ads were getting a 4 % click - through rate			1
that meant the people we needed to mobilize were seeing our message			1
it was an enormous success			2
" political advertising has gone mobile this election season , which means you 're likely to see more political ads texted to you , particularly if you live in a swing state			1
" these are sophisticated online campaigns that consider mobile an essential element of what they are doing , " said @entity70 , who wrote the book " campaign ' 08 : a turning point for @entity80			1
" " the last time around it was much more of a -- well , ' novelty ' might not be the right word			0
they were much more in an experimental mode			0
" in the 2008 presidential campaign , @entity47 's digital team generated headlines when he announced his running mate via a text message			1
there was even more mobile organizing going on quietly behind the scenes , according to @entity70			0
@entity47 's digital team sent out early voting reminders to supporters ' phones			0
texts pointed people to the nearest voter registration drive			0
his campaign even bought ad space in some swing states on 1 - 800 - @entity105			1
that meant when people called requesting a number for the nearest pizza delivery , they first had to listen to an @entity47 ad			0
@entity112 , who ran mobile efforts for @entity115 's 2008 presidential run , says its text - messaging campaign debuted two months before @entity47 's did			1
" while the @entity47 people run a sophisticated campaign now , we think they were sitting on the fence about texting until they saw @entity115 pull out her phone at an event in @entity127 , and there -- live on tv -- she told voters that 's how they could reach her now , " said @entity112 , who now runs @entity118 , a mobile payment site in the @entity120			1
@entity112 admits the campaign was still learning back then how to most effectively use the technology			0
one important lesson , which still holds up today , is that the most effective texts help the campaign feel more personal			0
" we learned , ' hello , will you please vote for me ? ' would n't work , " @entity112 said			0
" what does appeal is , ' i need your help , ' or ' help get this message out , ' or ' what do you think of this issue ? ' " @entity112 said the text campaigns generated thousands of volunteers			1
he reports about 30 % of the people who received the texts clicked on them			0
sometimes , though , old - fashioned technology ca n't keep up with demand			2
@entity112 said the @entity152 campaign once sent a text that asked people to join a conference call to discuss a certain issue			2
thousands jammed up the lines , but the call only allowed 2,000 people in			0
" the flip side is , politicians saw the power of this kind of advertising right there , and they saw this as an immediate way to mobilize thousands of volunteers , " he said			0
" @entity171 , digital director for presumptive @entity173 presidential nominee @entity172 , says mobile devices are now so powerful that he can do a lot more with a mobile campaign than he could back in 2008			0
he says 10 % of @entity172 's advertising budget was spent on digital efforts during the 2012 primary season			0
" screens are so much larger and we can send a much more dynamic message to people now , " said @entity171			2
@entity172 was the only candidate in the 2012 primaries with a mobile - specific campaign site , he said			1
@entity171 also designed a mobile ad campaign to heavily target people involved in the @entity189 caucuses			0
" we sent these ads with a click - to - call button to find out where the closest caucus was , " he said			1
" i think we use mobile a little bit differently than the other campaigns			2
we built the site for what we call the ' @entity200 moment of truth ' when people are using their phones to search for an answer about the campaign , " he added			0
" our mobile site is really stripped down			0
it is simpler , but we think provides a better user experience			0
" a spokeswoman for @entity47 's re-election campaign says the campaign does n't discuss its mobile strategy			0
but @entity47 , who drew acclaim for his savvy use of digital media in 2008 , is once again using mobile tools such as text messaging to communicate with supporters			2
people who download the @entity47 2012 mobile app on their gps - enabled devices if they opt in are essentially allowing the campaign to track their location , which could let strategists target messages to voters in certain areas			1
but in 2012 , voters do n't even need to opt into campaigns to receive these kinds of political texts			1
technology is so advanced that campaigns can target anyone who has enabled geolocation services on their smartphone , and pinpoint their location within a three - yard radius , said @entity38 , who also ran digital operations for @entity238 gov. @entity237 during the 2012 primary campaigns			1
many people , he said , do n't even realize they 've made their cell phone findable , although they 've downloaded apps like @entity243 or @entity244 to help them locate the nearest movie or restaurant			2
for a conservative client , @entity38 will target phones on conservative campuses , as he did with his @entity4 campaign			0
or if his candidate in @entity252 , @entity238 , wants to get his message out to one particular neighborhood , @entity38 will set the text to ping only phones in the local @entity258 restaurant at lunchtime , for example			1
his latest trick ? @entity262 people who have downloaded apps that are philosophically in keeping with a conservative message			1
for the @entity237 campaign in @entity189 , he sent an ad to everyone in the state who had downloaded a @entity271 app. " folks who got those texts were signing up to support @entity237 at a fantastic conversion rate , " said @entity38 , who heads @entity272 , a digital marketing firm			1
" that 's a very successful campaign , i can tell you			0
" overall , mobile outreach seems to be connecting with voters			2
after the 2010 midterm elections , a @entity282 poll found more than a quarter of the @entity286 adults they surveyed had used their mobile phones to learn more about , or even to participate in , the elections			0
and as phones become more sophisticated , the number of people who learn about elections on their phones is sure to grow			0
" there is no excuse as to why candidates are not doing this , " @entity38 said			0
" it 's that easy			0

campaigns are *increasingly* targeting voters in specific locations with text - message ads
you 're likely to see more political ads texted to you , particularly if you live in a swing state
a @entity237 strategist texted ads to smartphone owners who had downloaded a @entity271 app
