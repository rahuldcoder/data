in an exodus of almost biblical proportions , thousands trudge across a river to escape killers belonging to the @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7 , or @entity8			1
entire families carry nothing but the clothes on their backs			2
@entity14 , a 23 - year - old university student from @entity15 , told @entity16 his family fled to the barren and windswept @entity15 more than a week ago after @entity8 captured their town			1
the group , which calls itself the @entity5 , has been on a rampage , killing members of various minorities , including @entity23			1
@entity14 said after @entity8 arrived in his town , @entity26 neighbors of his turned on the minorities and helped @entity8 kill			1
" they join them , and actually they kill us			1
" " people you know ? " @entity16 asked			2
" yes , " he responded			2
" people -- our neighbors ! " @entity14 's family was among tens of thousands who flocked to the mountain and desperately waited for airdrops of food and water			2
his family escaped to @entity15 on foot and made a marathon 15 - hour journey to @entity7			1
after traveling northeast along the border , many families have been crossing a bridge in @entity47 , back into @entity48 - controlled @entity6			1
@entity14 said two of his young brothers did n't make it			2
" what we do ? " he said			2
" not enough water and dusty			2
" we are poor people			2
we do n't have any problem with anybody			2
we need someone ( to ) help us			2

many were too sick and exhausted to walk any farther			0
it 's unclear what lies ahead for those who managed to escape @entity8 and @entity15			1
some aid groups have teams helping , and the @entity71 is working to help @entity6 leaders organize humanitarian relief			1
but for now , some @entity23 tell @entity16 as they re-enter @entity6 territory , they play plan to camp out by the river			1

the group celebrates its own savagery , hoisting severed heads on poles and posting numerous videos online			0
during one of the airdrops on the mountain , a @entity16 crew observed as the crewmen tossed food and water to the ground			0
then the helicopter landed and was rushed by @entity23 seeking to escape			1
in a chaotic scene , some of the adults pushed their children on board , and some climbed on themselves			0
when the helicopter finally took off , the refugees wept out of relief			0
at the refugee camp near the @entity6 - @entity7 border , some people are finding relatives they 've not seen for years			1
@entity14 , for instance , reunited with a missing cousin			0
" we lost each other ! " he said			0
" we lost each other ! thank @entity181 , we arrived ! " in @entity182 , a desperate @entity23 father @entity184 is among the many yazidis around the world with family members who fled to @entity15			1
he made it into @entity182 with his six - month old son who needed life - saving heart surgery -- just days before @entity8 overran his village , where his wife and four other children were left behind			1
" there were hundreds of young men and children			0
like this , they cut off their heads			0
and they scream ' @entity181 is great ? ' what kind of human beings are they ? and they describe us as infidels ? " @entity207 told his family to flee to the mountains , where @entity8 ' vehicles ca n't reach			1
" they stayed seven days			0
there was no water , food , no medicine			0
they had to come down from the mountains , risking their lives			0
" now , he got word that his wife and kids survived , making it into the @entity48 region			0
and his baby boy is recovering well at a @entity227 hospital			0
but others are learning the worst			0
in the @entity71 , @entity23 fear for loved ones @entity230 is one of hundreds of @entity23 living in @entity231 , @entity232 , in the central @entity71			1
