now he 's conquering the @entity2 , too			0
a video of the @entity5 astronaut singing @entity8 's " @entity7 " from the @entity6 has been zipping around the web at light speed since it was posted sunday			1
the five - minute clip features @entity0 singing a modified version of the tune and strumming an acoustic guitar while floating through a space module , more than 200 miles above the @entity16			1
by monday afternoon , it had more than 1.8 million views on @entity19 , 3,000 comments on @entity21 and was being widely shared across social networks			1
@entity0 already was something of a social media star , with 260,000 fans on @entity26 and more than 825,000 followers on @entity28			2
during his five months aboard the @entity6 , he has posted numerous photos and videos of himself preparing meals , brushing his teeth and explaining how to vomit in space			1
but the elegant " @entity7 " video , reportedly months in the making , may rocket him into a higher orbit			1
@entity0 's earnest voice and unique perch in space brings a moving immediacy to @entity8 's verses , and when he sings , " i 'm floating in a most peculiar way " while actually floating , it 's a powerful moment			1
because @entity0 's vocals and guitar were recorded on the space station ( and mixed with supporting tracks by @entity48 , a @entity5 musician who once sang backup for @entity8 ) , some observers are calling it the first music video made in space			1
commenters on @entity21 praised the video 's simplicity and genuineness			2
" the floating guitar is really floating , it 's not some computer animation or trickery			2
the @entity16 turning behind him in the windows is the real deal			0
that 's us , that 's our blue dot , not some stock image , or animation ... , " wrote one @entity64			0
" the video has none of the @entity73 fakery we are used to			0
its power comes from this authenticity			0
" @entity0 took a few liberties with the lyrics of the 1969 @entity8 song , which became a hit upon its 1973 rerelease			1
in the original song , @entity82 loses radio contact with the astronaut , @entity85 , implying that the mission has failed			0
but @entity0 omits that part			2
@entity8 himself acknowledged the video , tweeting , " @entity90 in @entity91 ! " the 53 - year - old @entity0 launched aboard the @entity94 @entity93 spacecraft in december and in march became the first @entity5 to lead a spaceship as commander of the @entity6			1
the video clip was a farewell of sorts : @entity100 , @entity101			0
@entity102 and flight engineer @entity103 landed safely in their @entity93 spacecraft tuesday in @entity105 as scheduled , according to @entity106			0
one @entity21 commenter may have spoken for many when he wrote , " you 'd better freakin ' make it safely or this video will be the biggest tear - jerker on the @entity2			0
" more space and science news from @entity116 @entity115			0
