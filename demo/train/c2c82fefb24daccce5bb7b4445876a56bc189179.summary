-- the massacre at @entity2 has prompted the @entity4 administration to consider new gun laws , like banning high - capacity magazines			2
up until now , this -- along with other policy changes -- has in part been hindered by the @entity10 , which has fought to keep gun laws lax despite the fact that most of the @entity15 public support reasonable gun legislation			1
while this time might be different , there are reasons to suspect this tragedy could end like the others -- with nothing changed			0
however , if gun control proponents were clever they could use new insights from behavioral economics to get the best of the @entity10			1
the core reason the @entity10 seems to have a stranglehold on @entity15 politics is known in economics and political science as the " collective action problem			1
" a majority of the public supports common - sense restrictions on firearms			0
but because the numerous gun control supporters do not care as deeply as the much smaller share of gun control opponents , they are far less mobilized			1
one of us has seen firsthand what it 's like to go around testifying at legislative bodies about gun policy			2
over the years , the stands are filled with gun control opponents			1
gun control supporters are largely absent			1
highly visible tragedies periodically inspire what former president @entity50 would call the " silent majority " to act			0
the problem is that action is difficult to sustain over the long run by a large number of people who also care about other things as well			2
just look at the @entity59			0
on @entity61 in 2000 , an estimated 750,000 people marched on the @entity62 in @entity63 to call for tougher gun laws			2
the rally was in reaction to the tragic shootings at the @entity69 @entity68 and @entity70 , which both occurred the year before			0
the grass - roots reaction was supposed to usher in an era of common sense policies to curb gun violence			0
but then people got busy and distracted , and things fizzled			0
in 2001 , the rally attracted only about 100 supporters			0
today , federal gun laws are actually weaker than a decade ago			0
for example , the federal ban on assault weapons expired in 2004 and @entity83 has not renewed it			0
right now there is a brief window of opportunity for people who feel passionately about gun control to do something			1
the key for gun control proponents is to figure out how to turn people 's willingness to take a single action in a moment into an effortless and sustainable long - term commitment			1
here 's one way to defeat the @entity10 : ask people who are upset about this recent shooting to go online and sign up for automatic , monthly deductions to a fund devoted to breaking the grip of the @entity10			1
for every dollar the @entity10 spends in helping a political candidate , this new fund would spend $ 2 to help the opponent ( whether in a primary race or general election )			2
many politicians are currently afraid that opposing the @entity10 would lead the organization to stop providing their campaigns with either cash contributions or in - kind support ( such as advertisements and other forms of advocacy )			2
creating a fund that guaranteed a two - to - one match of @entity10 support -- but for the other side , ideally who supports stronger gun control -- would weaken the @entity10 's political clout			1
and how much should gun control proponents ask people to pledge ? according to the @entity127 , the @entity10 spent about $ 20 million on political activities in the 2012 election cycle ; including a little more than $ 1 million on direct campaign contributions and around $ 8.5 million on independent campaigns in support of congressional candidates			1
this might sound like a lot of money , but it is equal to only about 2 % of what @entity4 raised in 2012 and less than one - tenth of one percent of the net worth of the @entity10 's most vocal critic : @entity142 mayor @entity141			1
suppose @entity144 agreed to give one - tenth of one percent of his net worth each year , and gun control groups asked people to pledge the same percentage of their net worth			1
the cost to most people to match would be not more than $ 10 or $ 20 per month			0
while people could opt out any time , most people would never even notice this small automatic deduction			0
this strategy will work because it changes the default behavior of busy people from political passivity to activism			0
a few election cycles might be needed for the @entity10 and politicians to see the consequences of such a pledge			0
but when it happens -- when the @entity10 's grip is weakened significantly -- then perhaps @entity15 will see true policy changes on gun control through the active support of its public			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 and @entity172 .			2

@entity171 , @entity172 : use behavioral economics to fight the @entity10
@entity171 , @entity172 : the key is to turn a single action into a long - term commitment
one way is for people to sign up for automatic deductions to a fund that reduces @entity10 's clout
@entity171 , @entity172 : through such an action , @entity15 may see true policy changes on gun control
