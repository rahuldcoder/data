-- i ca n't fully understand why a bigoted rancher in @entity13 warrants as much media coverage asâ € ” or more coverage thanâ € ” a presidential trip to @entity5 , the delay of a major job - creating infrastructure project or the ongoing crisis in @entity10			2
and like nearly all stories that involve race and politics , the media has covered rancher @entity19 in a way that makes an honest conversation about race in @entity23 even more difficult			1
take , for instance , a conversation @entity0 anchor @entity26 had with my colleague , @entity28 communications director @entity27 , on friday morning			1
somehow @entity26 made the illogical conclusion that a racist rancher 's rant has implications for the @entity28 's minority engagement efforts			1
republicans " do n't really invite minorities in , " she insisted without evidence			2
@entity27 explained that the @entity28 is working to help the entire party listen and connect with the black community and with @entity23 of all backgrounds			1
he noted that not only is the @entity28 building long - term relationships and a permanent presence in black communities , but also that the @entity28 has hired a number of black staff members , both those focused on engaging with the black community and those who are not			1
that was n't good enough for @entity26			0
she did n't believe the @entity28 actually hired black staff members , especially senior level staff			1
so she demanded that @entity27 name names of black people working at the @entity28			1
she wanted a list of black staffers			2
is @entity26 hosting a news program or a dog and pony show ? @entity26 : @entity63 's problem wooing @entity65 - @entity23 voters as a senior - level staff member at the @entity28 who happens to be black , my job is to help the committee by developing communications and media strategy			1
my job is not to be put on display every time a news anchor wants to determine whether a political organization has the right number of people of color			0
how does that advance the discourse on race and politics in @entity23 ? that would be pandering			2
@entity26 , and others in the media who do the same thing , are perpetuating a double standard			1
when black republicans appear in the media , they suggest that @entity63 are just checking a box by putting a black person on screen			1
when we do n't put ourselves on display , they assume we do n't exist			0
that 's pretty revealing of their personal biases			0
that 's also a dangerous double standard			1
which brings us to the even bigger issue at hand			0
when someone who is n't even a @entity28 elected official or candidate says something disgusting and offensive , the media goes into overdrive to discuss how this is terrible for the @entity63			1
but when @entity112 elected officials , including a sitting governor and sitting vice president , say something racist or offensive , you do n't hear a peep			0
they get a free pass			0
the latest example comes from president @entity124 's home state			0
last week , the campaign of @entity126 gov. @entity126 promoted an article on @entity128 that labeled black @entity63 as race traitors and said they were akin to @entity132 @entity131 sympathizers			1
yes , a sitting @entity112 governor 's campaign was publicizing racist material			0
if you did n't hear about it , that proves my point			0
it was abhorrent , but national coverage was almost nonexistent until @entity0 finally posted an article late thursday			1
but did the media demand democrats apologize and ask the @entity144 for comment ? did they consider asking @entity144 chair @entity147 , a prominent @entity132 leader , to denounce the governor ? absolutely not			2
it was reminiscent of their ambivalent coverage when vice president @entity153 , during the 2012 campaign , told a group of black voters that his political opponents would " put y'all back in chains			2
" that was disgusting rhetoric , but the vice president is a @entity112 , so it was n't breaking news			0
it was just @entity153 being @entity153 , as his fans in the media like to say			2
again , it 's a double standard			1
racist language has no place in our political discourse			0
it 's unacceptable whenever and wherever it 's used			0
and yes , journalists , that includes the @entity175			1
@entity23 are n't hearing the full story when you 're only covering one side of it			0
if we 're going to defeat the racism that persists in @entity23 , we have to have intelligent conversations about it			0
the media should neither elevate it nor reduce it to some petty partisan game			2
but more often than not , media outlets are failing to meet that standard			1
that was the case on friday			0
let 's hope next time it 's different			0
join us on @entity196 / @entity195 .			0

@entity198 says @entity0 and the media have been *unfair* in its *criticism* of @entity63 and race
@entity28 , she says , has *stepped* up *outreach* to the black community
@entity198 : the media practices a double standard by not going after @entity175 who have issues with race
