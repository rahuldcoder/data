-- on the evening of december 3 , 2008 , @entity1 , a police officer for 19 years , walked up a trail in @entity4 's @entity3			1
he stopped , took out a .40 - caliber @entity6 semi-automatic handgun and shot himself in the temple			0
he was 42 years old			0
he was the father of two daughters			0
he was my firstborn son			2
most @entity10 are aware of the high rate of suicide among soldiers			2
less attention has been paid to those who protect us on the home front			2
the @entity17 , a group of former cops dedicated to preventing police suicide , reports that about 145 police officers take their lives every year , twice the number of cops killed by felons			1
the rate of police suicides is more than 1Â½ times the rate of the general population			0
the @entity17 also reports that for every suicide , a thousand working cops suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder , and another thousand struggle with serious depression , marital problems or substance abuse			1
my son had been through a painful divorce and was distraught about the failure of his marriage , his financial problems and the possible impact of the divorce on his youngest daughter			0
only after losing my son did i learn how susceptible cops are to suicide			1
@entity46 , a former @entity47 police officer turned clinical psychologist , wrote a book called " @entity50 , " and consults with the @entity51 and police agencies around the country			1
his main message is that cops can never let their guard down , that the very things that make cops safe and effective on the job can cause great harm in their personal and family life , and in some cases , destroy them			1
@entity46 writes vividly of the dangers of the " hypervigilance biological roller - coaster , " where officers on duty are " alive , alert , energetic , involved and humorous , " but when off duty , are " tired , detached , isolated and apathetic			0
" he points out that hypervigilance on the job produces a healthy amount of cynicism and mistrust , which is necessary for street survival , but off the job , can be destructive for emotional survival and relationships with family and loved ones			0
good cops create control out of chaos , and are willing to risk everything during a critical incident , which is usually short - lived			0
but when a cop gets depressed , these professional habits can become lethal			0
cops do n't do well when they ca n't control their situation or the source of their depression , and they begin to despair when they see that their problem -- the " critical incident " -- is never - ending			1
that 's what happened to @entity1			1
he told me how frustrating it was not to be in control , and he often told me , " this will never end			0
" he went from depression to despair			0
i believe he was convinced that everyone would be better off if he was gone			0
@entity1 and i were close			2
i knew he was struggling , but my perception of him as secure and healthy never allowed me to imagine he could end his own life			0
@entity105 , a psychologist , police trainer , and author of " i love a cop , " writes about the paradox between an officer 's work life and personal life , and how police work changes people			1
she emphasizes that cops are oriented toward control and details situations that lead to suicide , including , " family conflicts , relationship losses , depression , immediate access to guns , poor coping skills , financial difficulties , shame , failure and a distorted but culturally correct sense of invincibility and independence			1
" @entity105 defines trauma as a normal reaction to an abnormal event , an emotional reaction that can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts			2
a police officer can be traumatized by many events that are abnormal or infrequent in other people 's lives : shootings , a civilian getting severely injured in a police action , a child 's death , a violent confrontation , a bad car crash or a gory crime scene			1
@entity149 , a former @entity150 state trooper , is a public health professor who has extensively researched police suicide			2
he is the co-editor of " @entity153 : tactics for @entity155 , " which advocates peer support and stress management programs and emphasizes the importance of mental health treatment and a culture in which asking for help is not seen as a poor career move or a sign of weakness			0
the @entity17 promotes " emotional self - care training , " with the idea that every officer is a potential trauma victim			2
the members believe suicide prevention programs are crucial , but argue that departments must go beyond that to train officers to recognize trauma in themselves , to manage stress , to become resilient , and to understand the value of healthy lifestyles , including exercise			1
my son was the second @entity180 police officer to commit suicide in 2008			1
as a result , the @entity182 started to require agency - wide training			0
the department told its officers that if they were depressed and feeling suicidal , they could come in confidentially , receive counseling and keep their jobs			0
in the year after @entity1 died , 12 officers came in , got help and stayed on the job			1
the @entity192 lost three officers to suicide in 2010			2
today , the @entity192 's advanced officer training program includes a two - hour session on trauma , depression , substance abuse , suicide and the value of an annual , voluntary mental health checkup , not unlike an annual physical			1
as part of that training , i speak each week to 30 officers			0
i tell them @entity1 's story , summarize the research on police suicide , tell them that the very things that make them effective as cops can be destructive in their personal lives , and stress that asking for help is not a sign of weakness , but a sign of strength			1
when i 'm back in my car i usually fall apart , revisiting the horror of four years ago			0
but i know i 'm honoring my son by doing this			0
the @entity225 has also aggressively addressed suicide prevention			1
but too many other police departments across the nation , even as they invest heavily in training in weapons use , tactics and physical safety , are not acknowledging the hidden risks of police work and protecting those who protect the rest of us			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			2

@entity240 became a suicide prevention trainer after his son , a police officer , killed himself
about 145 cops commit suicide a year , he says . thousands have ptsd and depression
@entity1 : cops see traumatic stuff every day . what helps them on the job can harm them at home
@entity1 : police departments need to teach officers to recognize trauma and provide help
