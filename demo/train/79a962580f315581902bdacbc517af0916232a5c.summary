-- a former @entity2 student accused of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate by use of a hidden webcam was found guilty friday of all counts -- including invasion of privacy and the more severe charges of bias intimidation -- in a case that thrust cyberbullying into the national spotlight			1
@entity14 , 20 , was also found guilty of witness tampering , hindering apprehension and tampering with physical evidence , and could now face up to 10 years in jail and deportation to his native @entity20			1
sentencing has been set for may 21			0
the @entity23 jury was confronted with a series of questions on each charge after it asked for clarification on what constituted bias intimidation			1
though it found @entity30 not guilty on several questions within the verdict sheet , because he was found guilty on at least one question on each main count , @entity30 was convicted on all charges and could now face the maximum penalty			1
his roommate , @entity39 , an 18 - year - old freshman , killed himself in september 2010 by jumping off the @entity40 and into the @entity41 after learning that @entity30 had secretly spied on his sexual encounter with another man			1
@entity0 legal analyst @entity44 called friday 's verdict " unprecedented , " adding that it " sends a message to people across the rest of the country " about the potential consequences of unauthorized webcam use in an age of expanding social media			2
" @entity23 enacted a law that said if you secretly record ( someone engaged in an intimate act ) with a webcam or any other kind of video and you broadcast that without their permission , that is a crime , " @entity44 said			0
" every place else in @entity66 up until this law was enacted , you could sue somebody for civil damages for the embarrassment , but you were n't going to go to jail			0
@entity23 said it 's criminal			0
" and because prosecutors were able to prove that @entity30 's actions were born of a gay bias , the possible sentence doubles from up to five years to 10 years behind bars			1
@entity79 's death stirred discussion about bullying , with president @entity82 releasing a videotaped message condemning it			1
a few months later , @entity23 legislators enacted stricter laws to protect against bullying in schools			0
" this haunting and awful case shows how much society has changed , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity87 of friday 's verdict			0
" even though he was not charged directly in connection with @entity79 's suicide , that tragedy hung over the trial and undoubtedly played a major part in every aspect of the case			1
" after the verdict , @entity2 released a statement saying , " this sad incident should make us all pause to recognize the importance of civility and mutual respect in the way we live , work and communicate with others			0
" prosecutors had argued that @entity30 , who sat expressionless in the courtroom friday , had tried to embarrass @entity79 because he was gay and that his actions were motivated by a desire to intimidate the @entity112 , @entity23 , native expressly because of his sexual orientation			1
" these acts were purposeful , they were intentional , and they were planned , " prosecutor @entity114 told the jury on the first day of the trial			0
@entity30 " was bothered by @entity39 's sexual orientation , " she later said more bluntly			1
@entity30 's attorneys countered by saying their client acted thoughtlessly , portraying him as an immature college student who made a mistake , and that his actions were not based on homophobia			2
" he has n't lived long enough to have any experience with homosexuality or gays , " attorney @entity124 said in closing arguments earlier this week			0
" he does n't know anything about it			0
he just graduated high school			0
" after the verdict friday , @entity124 said he would " prepare some type of press release " next week , but vowed to appeal the ruling			0
" right now i am just dealing with the emotions that everyone involved with the @entity30 family and the defense experienced and continue to experience with the verdict , " he said			2
though @entity30 and @entity39 -- a fellow student who admitted to joining @entity30 to watch the surreptitious encounter that others were alerted to via social media -- were charged in the wake of @entity79 's suicide , they were not charged directly with his death			1
facing two counts of invasion of privacy , @entity148 reached a plea deal in may that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate as well as to complete a three - year program on cyberbullying and do 300 hours of community service			2
@entity30 turned down a plea deal offered by @entity160 prosecutors that would have allowed him to avoid jail time in exchange for undergoing counseling , doing 600 hours of community service and disposing of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the web video with @entity79			1
prosecutors also offered to help him avoid deportation , though they said they could not guarantee it			0
@entity30 , who had been studying on a visa at the @entity23 university , did not testify on his own behalf			0
during the prosecution 's phase of the trial , the man whom @entity79 was intimate with , identified only as " @entity176 , " told jurors that he had noticed a web camera aimed directly at @entity79 's bed			1
the 32 - year - old man testified that he met @entity79 on a social - networking site for gay men and that they eventually met three times in the student 's dorm room			2
the two conversed online , exchanged text messages and eventually had sex , he said			0
@entity148 testified that she watched @entity176 and @entity79 after @entity30 had secretly set up the webcam in his and @entity79 's dormitory room			1
@entity30 's attorney , @entity124 , has argued his client had initially switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate 's visitor			1
in @entity199 messages from that day , @entity30 wrote that he 'd gone into a friend 's room , " turned on my webcam " and saw his roommate " making out with a dude			1
" then on september 22 , 2010 , @entity79 took a train to @entity206 and posted a mobile status update on his @entity209 page that read , " jumping off the gw bridge sorry			2
" @entity30 had apparently tried to make amends with his estranged roommate that same night , according to text messages revealed in court			2
" i 've known you were gay and i have no problem with it , " @entity30 wrote in messages after he apparently learned his roommate had requested a room change			2
it is not clear whether @entity79 ever viewed the messages before committing suicide			0
@entity223 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
