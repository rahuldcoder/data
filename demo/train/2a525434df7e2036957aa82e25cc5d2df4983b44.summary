-- not even football - or soccer , for those in the @entity4 - could stop them			2
while the @entity7 , a warm - up tournament for next year 's football @entity8 , went on , hundreds of thousands of @entity6 took to the streets of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and many other major cities in @entity6			1
read more : a new age of protests in the beginning , they were few , mostly youngsters disgruntled with a 20 centavos ( 10 cents ) rise in bus and train fares			1
after a violent response from the police , they were joined by @entity6 of all ages who had their own issues to shout about			1
corruption , poor public services , increasing inflation , lack of security and the not - so - much - loved - anymore @entity8			1
at a time when @entity6 was supposed to be celebrating , the streets were full of anger , chanting , confrontation with the police and destruction , produced by a minority of radical demonstrators			1
watch running battles between police and protesters in @entity12 why did the protests gain traction ? tricky question , but there is one thing no - one can deny : a significant number of @entity6 are very upset with the state of the nation			1
the transport fare hikes were canceled on wednesday , after local authorities in @entity11 and @entity12 agreed to a u-turn in an attempt to bring back peace and order to the streets			2
it is still unclear whether this will mean an end to the protests			0
more important than the issue , though , seems to be the timing of all this			0
bus fare increases in previous years had not led to any significant popular reaction			0
the same movement that started this month 's protests - the @entity72 ( @entity73 , or @entity74 ) - had been active in previous years			0
after each announcement of a new bus fare they would go to the streets in their hundreds , sometimes only dozens , without being noticed by many			0
authorities expected the same in 2013			0
the latest increase , of less than 7 % , was the first in two years and below the inflation of the period			2
the government , the press , the police and even bystanders were taken off - guard			1
but , somehow , the timing was just perfect for a national revolt			0
@entity6 protesters : @entity8 only benefits outsiders that could be explained by the way we look at @entity6			1
in the past decade , when the country took some 30 million people out of poverty , @entity6 enjoyed looking at what the country and its people had achieved : more formal employment , more investment , more growth , greater spending power for those who had none , more security and better outlook on life			1
on top of that , @entity6 had secured the privilege to host the two main sports events in the world - the football @entity8 and the @entity118 in @entity6 ) @entity119 - in 2014 and 2016 , respectively			1
@entity6 just seemed to have it all			1
with only one caveat : it did not			2
when facts of life began to remind many @entity6 that their lives were not as good as the government claimed , and the football extravaganza got closer , indicating more costs for the state without apparent benefits for the people , many people began to look at their country in a different light			1
instead of focusing on the achievements , they looked at what they did not have , and that view seemed to go as far as the @entity137			0
in 2010 , after eight years with a hugely popular president , the former metal worker @entity138 , @entity6 saw his former minister @entity139 elected as his successor			1
from the same leftist @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , @entity139 became the first female @entity6 president			1
two - and - a - half years have passed , and she is still popular among the poorest , but the recent protests were led by a different bunch : the traditional middle class			0
on the streets , well - educated people , from central , urban areas , shouted that they had been sold a lie			0
inflation is once again a major concern , violent crime is on the rise , cases of corruption fill the press , healthcare is in a precarious state , infrastructure projects have not materialized and street traffic is depressingly worse than ever			1
while tv showed the inaugurations of costly , lavish football stadiums , people felt their lives were getting worse by the day			2
after all , the @entity8 will cost the nation some $ 15 billion , and the promised legacy in infrastructure is still nowhere to be seen			0
worst of all : a government accustomed to surf on its safe popularity , secured mainly by the distribution of money to the poorest , did not feel the need to listen			2
@entity139 's message , in pre-recorded announcements on tv , has been that the country just could not be better			0
the @entity179 is even more to blame , with its representatives lashed by public opinion for shocking privileges , high salaries and cases of sleaze			2
a survey by @entity188 institute , conducted this week in the city of @entity11 , shows a drastic fall in the prestige of political institutions in the past decade			0
only 19 % of respondents say they hold the office of president in high regard , compared with 51 % in 2003			0
the percentage of respondents who say they hold the @entity179 in high regard has fallen from 30 % in 2003 , to 12 % now			0
many who took to the streets in @entity6 - and inspired @entity6 around the world to do the same in their adopted countries - carried banners saying : " it is not only about r $ 0,20			1
" what they meant is that the bus fare rise was perhaps the least of their concerns			2
corruption , lack of accountability and a realization that many promises have not been fulfilled were what led them to the streets			2
the suspension of the transport fare rise may take them back to their normal lives			1
the issues , however , will not go away any time soon			0
and unless they are properly addressed , those problems can make the people march again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			0

@entity228 : @entity6 just seemed to have it all . with only one caveat : it did not
inflation is a major concern , violent crime is on the rise , cases of corruption fill the press
many realized that their lives were not as good as the government claimed , he says
