the @entity1 winter may be long and dark but one light still shines bright in the @entity3 -- @entity5 's booming tourist trade			2
foreign visitors increased by 15.9 % last year whilst travel now accounts for 5.9 % of @entity8 , according to the @entity5 tourist board			2
given the financial catastrophe confronting the country as recently as 2008 -- when the @entity13 stepped in with a $ 2.1 billion loan after several major @entity5 banks collapsed -- this turbo - charged development is all the more remarkable			1
" we 've had this extraordinary growth in tourism in the last few years , " @entity5 's president , @entity16 , told @entity18 's @entity17			1
" because [ in ] the tourism structure of @entity5 we have many small and medium - sized companies in the north , the east and the west , the economic benefits spread through the economy and all over the country in a way that no other sector actually does			1
" watch video : @entity17 's presidential tour of @entity5 @entity5 's economy is predicted to grow by 2.7 % this year and unemployment will fall to 5.7 % , according to @entity35 -- thanks in part to the expansion of tourism			1
for president @entity16 , this is just the start of a back - to - basics economic approach that will focus less on risky financial services and more on industries such as clean energy tech , fishing and , of course , travel			1
official figures show that @entity5 currently attracts 600,000 visitors a year , but by 2020 @entity16 says he hopes this figure will be nearer two million , almost seven times the country 's population			1
key to meeting these ambitious targets is the successful promotion of @entity5 's pristine natural beauty -- its rural hinterland is famed for its spectacular volcanoes and natural hot springs -- as well as its potential as a business and aviation hub			1
according to @entity65 , ceo of @entity66 , the country 's only international airport , @entity5 's geographic location makes it the perfect pit stop for long - distance flights			2
" we are in the middle of the @entity73 between @entity74 and the @entity75 , which is the best place for a hub ... airport to be , " he says			0

@entity5 's tourist trade was even able to safely negotiate the ash - cloud chaos caused by the erupting @entity94 volcano in mid- 2010			0
close to 100,000 flights were cancelled and millions of passengers were left stranded in what was the biggest disruption to air travel since @entity99 " we were worried , if the handsome growth we had been experiencing year - on - year would be halted , " says , @entity100 , @entity5 's tourism minister			1
" but fortunately that did not happen			0
" he added : " for the good or worse , the eruption proved to both @entity74 and @entity75 that @entity5 is not so far away			0
at least we were close enough to cause all this trouble for the aviation industry			0
" despite an initial dip in visitor numbers , @entity5 returned to double digit travel growth by late 2010			0
such resilience so soon after the financial crisis provides @entity100 with a bullish outlook for the future			0
" if things go on for a number of years , in addition with growth of 10 to 15 % , tourism will be @entity5 's industry number one , in terms of foreign currency earnings , " he says			2

some in @entity5 already fear that the country is becoming overrun with tourists , but @entity16 is confident @entity5 can cope			1
" this is a country the size of @entity129 -- a big part of it is volcanic desert , glaciers , rivers , lakes -- so if we decide to do it we can control the traffic in such a way that we allow people to enjoy the beauty of the country without being overcrowded , " he says			0
he adds : " when this decade comes to an end we might have two million tourists coming to @entity5 every year , and we have to plan for that			2
" that is a debate i have encouraged the nation to engage in over the next few years			0
