@entity0 , @entity1 -- new appliances and vacation packages are n't unusual giveaways in the housing slump , but one woman is taking the unorthodox step of throwing in a car with the purchase of her home			2
@entity12 is throwing in a @entity14 hybrid with the sale of her renovated @entity1 house			1
" my daughter came up with the idea , " @entity12 said			1
" we 're losing money on the house , and the @entity14 only adds to losing money , but we also realize it 's time we really got to sell the house			1
" @entity12 and her daughter bought the 1907 three - bedroom colonial in @entity0 , @entity1 , in 2005 as an investment property			1
in the past , the pair has bought two historic homes within minutes of @entity1 's shoreline , renovated and resold them during a red - hot housing market			2
@entity12 said she and her daughter bought this house for $ 335,000 , spent $ 300,000 restoring it and were hoping for a $ 40,000 profit when they first put it on the market			1
but after more than a year of trying to sell it , taking it off the market and putting it back on , they say they 're ready to cut their losses			0
with gas prices hovering about $ 4 a gallon in most states , they hope the fuel - efficient @entity14 hybrid , which costs about $ 23,000 for a new model , will sweeten the pot even more			1
@entity12 's real estate agent said he is optimistic about the giveaway , saying that an incentive of that magnitude was a first for one of his clients			1
" you have to be creative			2
you have to learn how to do different things , and if we learn anything from this , certainly , we will replicate it , " said @entity61 , who has put an ad for the @entity14 in the local newspaper			1
but @entity68 of the @entity69 cautions buyers about " gimmicks " to draw attention to a house			1
" in my 18 years as a @entity74 , i have never known anyone who has actually received whatever it was , the trip or the car , " said @entity68 , a regional vice president for the @entity69			0
" it 's generally negotiated away during the process of the buying or selling negotiations			0
" she added that a competitive selling price is a better way to get buyers interested and generate a sale			2
according to the @entity69 , existing home sales remain 14 percent below a year ago			0
even with a projected small uptick in 2009 , analysts are predicting a slow recovery			0
@entity12 said she is motivated by a love for old homes			2
" it 's not flipping , so much as coming back and renovating and presenting it to the person who appreciates that , " she said			0
" it 's not like coming and going ' @entity101 , bam , here 's a house for you , ' just jack up the price $ 100,000			0
" the love affair with historic houses is still there			0
we 're having to be realistic also			0
" the house is selling for $ 595,000 , and @entity12 says she is willing to reduce the price if a potential buyer does n't want the @entity14			1
she just hopes the car gets them through the door , because a straight price cut apparently just does n't cut it anymore .			0

@entity12 hopes the incentive of a @entity14 will draw buyers
@entity12 bought the 1905 colonial home for $ 335,000 , hoped for $ 40,000 profit
some *realtors* say the incentive is creative , others caution against it as a gimmick
