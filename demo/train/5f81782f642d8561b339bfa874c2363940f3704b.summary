-- february 28 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : february 28th : the month is just about over			1
but 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines are just getting started			1
welcome to a new week of @entity0 ! first up : crisis in @entity4 @entity18 : first up , @entity20 officials say the best hope for @entity4 is for @entity22 to leave			1
the @entity4 leader is the focus of protests that have been going on for weeks			1
and the international community is getting involved in this			1
on saturday , the @entity28 @entity27 voted 15 - 0 to punish @entity4 by putting sanctions , or restrictions , on col. @entity22 and his associates			1
some experts say @entity4 has been under sanctions before ; they have n't worked			1
the @entity27 referred the crisis to the international criminal court , which could decide to investigate col. @entity22 for war crimes			1
the @entity28 also acted to freeze @entity22 's financial assets , which means he wo n't have access to some of his money			1
the @entity20 made the same move yesterday			1
back in @entity4 , thousands of people are trying to get away from the violence			1
the @entity28 @entity43 on refugees says a lot of those people have fled to the neighboring countries of @entity48 and @entity49			2
@entity50 @entity18 : @entity5 president @entity51 says a little more than half of the reconstruction is finished , one year after a devastating earthquake hit @entity5			2
president @entity51 said more than 2 million people were directly affected by the quake			2
in the early morning hours sunday , @entity5 gathered for a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary and remember the 521 people killed by the quake			2
president @entity51 , who had n't taken office yet when the tremor struck , called it the most destructive earthquake in the history of @entity5			2
this file footage shows you scenes from the aftermath of the quake			2
it was tremendous , with a magnitude of 8.8			2
and now , even a year later , dozens are still missing			2
@entity75 @entity18 : workers ' unions are at the heart of a budget battle in @entity80			2
@entity81 governor @entity81 says his state is broke and unions block efforts that could save money			2
people protesting against governor @entity81 's proposed budget bill say it 's designed to break up unions by limiting collective bargaining			1
that 's when unions negotiate working conditions for employees			1
governor @entity81 talked recently about why collective bargaining should be limited			2
@entity95 @entity81 , ( r ) @entity80 : collective bargaining has a cost			2
it has a cost in terms of health care and pension contributions			2
it has a cost overall in terms of how our governments operate at the local level			2
and we 've got to change that relationship so that we can preserve jobs and ultimately , most importantly , so that the corrections we make for this budget are n't one - time fixes or short - term fixes			2
@entity18 : last week , the @entity80 assembly passed the budget bill			2
the @entity117 has n't voted yet , because @entity118 have n't come back ; they left the state to keep the vote from happening			2
governor @entity81 says layoffs could be coming if they ca n't reach an agreement soon			2
one leading @entity80 @entity124 says the governor and @entity126 are n't listening to what people want			2
@entity129 , ( @entity130 ) minority leader , wisconsin assembly : governor @entity81 and assembly @entity126 are so out of touch that they are willing to resort to these extreme ends to achieve their political goals			2
@entity136 @entity137 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity140 's social studies classes at @entity141 in @entity142 ! which of these is located about 220 miles above the @entity146 's surface ? is it the : a ) @entity148 , c ) @entity152 telescope or @entity130 ) international space station ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the international space station is orbiting the @entity146 about 220 miles above its surface			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity159 @entity18 : and that 's where the space shuttle discovery is right now , too			1
the shuttle and its six - person crew , on a mission to deliver a science rig and other equipment and spare parts to the international space station			1
@entity170 docked with the @entity171 over the weekend			0
this is the 13th time the shuttle 's made its way up to the station , and also its last			1
the space shuttle program is winding down and this is @entity170 's final scheduled mission			1
the @entity176 and the @entity177 are set to go up later this year			0
and every time a shuttle launches , it comes with costs and it comes with risks			1
and as @entity183 explains , that has some people asking , why keep sending shuttles up ? ( begin video ) @entity187 , @entity188 : a moment to be remembered , historic			0
@entity190 announcer : space shuttle @entity177 now comes home to the @entity192 for the final time			1
@entity194 : it was over , the first of the three shuttles heads to retirement			0
@entity198 the tires , polish the metal			0
hold on , not so fast			0
something happened on the way to the museum			0
@entity205 , @entity190 associate administrator for space operations : if we did n't think we really needed this flight , i would not be recommending this flight			1
@entity194 : @entity190 , with @entity214 backing , in fact urging , decided @entity177 had one more flight in her			0
hold off on those moth balls			0
once the shuttle program ends and until commercial companies take over , with rockets ten times safer than the shuttle , the @entity218 will ferry astronauts to the space station			1
@entity225 shortens that gap and allows @entity190 to stock the station 's pantry			1
@entity229 : you know , it can carry , you know , roughly five to ten times what one of these single other supply ships can carry			0
so , in one shuttle mission , you could think of me being able to carry at least five other vehicles ' worth of cargo			1
@entity194 : but it 's an expensive u-haul trip			1
shuttle flights cost about half a billion dollars			1
@entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 : the rule of thumb is whenever the space shuttle flies , it 's a waste of money			1
the space shuttle is hugely expensive for what it does and it 's not that safe , which is why it 's being discontinued			1
so , to continue it for one more flight is not necessary			0
@entity194 : but @entity190 has what it needs to pull off the flight			0
there was one more external tank at the factory in @entity260 , and an extra set of booster rockets came in by train from @entity264			0
but is this more about putting off the inevitable end and keeping shuttle workers employed than a real need ? @entity269 , @entity190 , launch director : this is our passion			1
this is what we do			0
i mean this is , this is how we support our families and how we support the @entity277 people and the international partners			1
it 's not dragging it out , it 's allowing us to continue doing what we do best			1
@entity194 : @entity177 is scheduled to lift off in late june , return in early july			0
this time , when the @entity190 commentator says ... @entity190 announcer : space shuttle @entity177 now comes home to the @entity192 for the final time			1
@entity194 : ... he 'll mean it			0
@entity183 , @entity0 , at the @entity192 in @entity286			0
( @entity287 ) this day in history @entity18 : it 's february 28th , and on this day in history in 1953 , @entity289 and @entity290 discovered the double - helix structure of @entity292			1
in 1983 , the final episode of the show " @entity295 " became the single most watched episode in television history			0
in 1993 , federal agents raided the compound of the @entity301 cult in @entity302 , @entity303			0

a lot of you agree with @entity347 that @entity348 should be in the hall of fame			0
he shattered the barrier in baseball between black and white people ; he was inspiring			0
@entity353 nominates @entity354 because he 's one of the few people who can be a great comedian by using clean humor			1
@entity359 names @entity360 ; she has cared and told about so many wonderful people			0
and @entity362 says @entity363 transformed the way we use the peanut and inspired @entity362 to become a great scientist ! @entity368 @entity18 : even though @entity319 is coming to a close , you can keep celebrating the accomplishments of african - americans			0
@entity373 to the @entity375 section at @entity376			0
you 'll find the reports that aired on our show this past month and our @entity380			0
it 's all free and one click away at @entity376 ! before we go @entity18 : before we go , you know the saying " what goes up must come back down			1
" and for this high - rise building in @entity388 , @entity389 , it 's time			1
at first , it looks like an indoor fireworks show			0
but once the first puffs of smoke start to show up , it does n't take long for the whole thing to cave in on itself			0
officials decided that demolition was the only option for this run - down relic			0
they even set up a special ceremony so folks could see how they were tearing something down ... goodbye @entity18 : ... in order to pave the way for the future			0
