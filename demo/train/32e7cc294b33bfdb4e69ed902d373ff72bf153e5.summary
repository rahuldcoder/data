-- what i learned is what we all forget : it 's more than a game			1
it 's easy to lose that understanding with a sport as popular , profitable and money - grubbing as football			1
this saturday , tv screens will be filled with college conference title games -- even as universities race each other to new conferences in search of a higher bidder			2
on sundays , the @entity20 's cool efficiency can look more bloodless than its own video games , as if the real thing was now just a parlor game to bet on			1
but high school football remains the sport 's origin story			1
despite its own set of perversions , especially during recruiting season , it 's still mostly a hyper - local , myth - making phenomenon that defines small towns , suburban communities and urban pockets across the country			1
photos : 75 amazing sports moments you missed this year two seasons ago , i spent a year in @entity40 , a quaint outpost of about 54,000 in deepest @entity41 , to write a book about that phenomenon			2
i embedded for a season with players , coaches , boosters and families to chronicle the rise , fall and hoped - for resurrection of the winningest high school football program in @entity52			1
under two era - spanning coaches , @entity53 won 23 state championships and six national titles			2
it won so often , for so long , that it could lose every game for the next 65 seasons and still have a record above .500			1
but @entity40 had n't won the state title since 1998 , the longest drought in its 100 - year history , and was on its fourth coach in nine years			2
like much of the rest of the country , it seemed , @entity40 was at a crossroad			2
this was a place that once held the funeral for one of its most revered coaches inside the football stadium , where nearly 8,000 mourners gazed out at an open casket set on the 50 - yard line			1
the current coach holds his weekly radio show inside a barbecue palace called @entity84 , run by one of the 21 former @entity86 descended from the same @entity87			1
season tickets are passed down in wills , if they 're passed down at all			1
during a wake a couple years ago for one longtime fan , six tickets for the next home game were spotted in the open casket			1
but stuff like that can be written off as garden variety , @entity99 eccentricity			2
the players wanted to talk to me about why they went out there on friday nights and what football meant to them			1
that 's when the game 's mysterious inner world really opened up			1
this was n't the sport of luxury suites , beer commercials and wardrobe malfunctions at halftime			2
this was football as muse , lifeline , @entity119 and cultural imperative			1
this was the chance for some kids who 'd already run out of chances to let out one loud , lasting yelp into the wilderness -- a way to show everybody in town who they were , what they were capable of , why they mattered			1
" a poet uses a pencil to express himself , " senior running back @entity136 tapped onto his @entity138 page from his phone before one game , " but ima football player so i use 9.5 pair of nikes on turf			1
" for @entity147 , a defensive back and aspiring rapper , taking the field on friday nights allowed him to watch his parents smile , talk with a dead aunt , and play a little ball beside his murdered cousin			1
as he and his swaggering teammates entered 11,000 - seat @entity155 ( named for the school 's two late , iconic coaches ) , the stage - lit carpet inside morphed into a fantastical world unlike anything he lived in the rest of the week			1
the first person he usually spotted in the stands was his mother , who had @entity147 when she was 14 , standing and clapping and smiling			2
then somewhere nearby he 'd find his father , divorced and remarried , and who @entity147 mostly remembers as being in jail			1
now a landscaper and a preacher , he stood and cheered for his son , too			0
crouching in the defensive backfield before each play -- dreads spilling from his helmet , tats stamped up and down both arms -- @entity147 often talked aloud to his dead cousin , gunned down a year earlier in a shootout at a public housing complex across town from the one where @entity147 and his mother then lived			0
" what would you do , @entity184 ? " he 'd say , as if his cousin was a teammate crouched beside him			1
or : " this is a big one , @entity184			0
let 's fly ! " or he 'd talk to a long - dead aunt who lived with @entity147 and his mother , the light of young @entity147 's life before she was murdered			1
the crime went unsolved until after the funeral , when police returned to her grave , dug up her coffin and found the gun used to kill her hidden beneath her corpse			0
their deaths still weighed heavily on @entity147 , and the football field felt like a secure , supportive place to work some of that out			1
" i got a lot of people who are n't here on my back , " @entity147 told me one night			0
" on friday night , they 're living through me			0
" on the field , it 's my own world , " he went on			1
" it 's a place where i can be myself			1
i do n't have to worry about anyone fussin '			0
my parents come to games and i see them smile and clap their hands and stand up -- stuff like that does n't happen at home			0
at home , there 's always bills to pay			0
" that 's why i 'm not just playing ball , " @entity147 continued			0
" it 's more than a game			1
it 's what i live for			0
when people see ballplayers , they think it 's just something they do			0
i 'm there because i love to be there			0
on the field on friday night , i 'm doing something that loves me back -- i love it and it loves me back			1
" the game also gave @entity147 another thing he could n't find anywhere else : a taste of immortality , no small thing on the disposable streets where he grew up			1
@entity147 gave me a tour one night of the @entity253 projects he 'd lived in until his mother saved enough money to move them out			1
he still has relatives there and visits all the time			0
we left an aunt 's apartment around midnight , and as we walked back to my car @entity147 spotted a group of guys loitering on a corner a block away			1
that used to be @entity147			0
football made him want something beyond that corner			2
" i seen people standing on that same corner all my life , " @entity147 said			0
" you can @entity275 me			0
you ca n't take anyone on this street and @entity275 them			0
but you can @entity275 me			0
" like @entity147 , teammate @entity281 also learned to love the game in high school , and it loved him back , too			1
but while @entity147 's last football game as a player was his last game as a @entity288 -- he raps full time now under the stage name @entity290 -- @entity281 has gone on to star at wide receiver for the @entity292			1
yet he 's already tasted immortality , too			0
@entity281 blossomed into a head - turning athlete his final season at @entity40 -- he wanted to quit his sophomore year until his mother talked him out of it -- and was wooed by schools across the @entity301 , including @entity302 and @entity303			2
that last high school season , he told me about a voice in his head when he took the field , how it told him to anticipate something before it happened , and what to do when it came about			1
he said the voice had never been louder or more distinct than it was that year			0
he 'd given up trying to figure out what it was			2
he was just going with it			0
" i want to say it 's @entity316 telling me that something 's going to happen , " he tried to explain , " but it 's something telling me			0
" whatever it was , it worked			0
@entity281 broke @entity40 's three - decade - old record for most catches in a season			2
the previous record holder was @entity324 , widely considered the greatest athlete in @entity40 's history			0
@entity324 went on to become an @entity20 wide receiver , as well as the father of @entity329 , another highly recruited @entity288 and now @entity281 's teammate and roommate at @entity332			0
" i got my way into the museum -- into the history books , " @entity281 said one afternoon after that season			2
" i got to the point where i 'll always be remembered			0
maybe if i make it to the @entity20 it 'll be bigger than this			0
maybe if i make it to the @entity342			0
but right now , people will remember me for this no matter what			0
" we talked a little more that afternoon about @entity347 ; @entity281 detailed the dialogues that ran through his head during a half dozen critical plays that season			2
i then mentioned @entity147 's on - field conversations with relatives from the beyond			2
he did n't find any of it weird or unconventional			0
" for an athlete who loves to play the game , it happens more than you know , " he said			2
" we 're not just running around			0

*author* *documented* a season with the winningest high school football program in @entity52
he learned the game was a chance to shine for guys who 'd already run out of chances
one player called the field a " secure , supportive place "
