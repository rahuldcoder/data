how cute was our universe as a baby ? we now know better than ever : the picture of our early universe just got sharper and tells scientists with greater precision many important facts about how the universe evolved			1
this new photogenic moment , released thursday , comes courtesy of the @entity14 's @entity13 space telescope , which detects cosmic microwave background radiation -- the light left over from the @entity17			1
scientists used data from @entity13 to create an artificially colored map of temperature variations across the sky in the early universe , in more detail than ever before			1
" it 's a big deal , " said @entity24 , @entity13 project scientist at @entity26 's @entity25 , in a news briefing			2
he added , " we can tie together a whole range of phenomena that could n't be tied together so well before , and the sum total of that , the impact , is felt in many , many ways			0
" the light is technically from 380,000 years after the @entity17 , but that 's still infancy when you consider that , according to the new data , the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years			1
" by the matching observations from @entity13 to predictions from models , we can assemble a surprisingly detailed picture of the universe as it was one nano - nano - nano - nanosecond after the @entity17 , " said @entity41 , professor of physics and astronomy at @entity44			1
@entity41 compared the @entity13 map to the @entity51 in terms of its importance for cosmology			1
after analyzing the new data , scientists now believe that the universe is about 100 million years older than they thought			1
the universe 's light started out as a white hot glow and would have been blindingly bright if anyone had been around to see it , @entity24 said			2
but since the @entity17 , that hot light has cooled significantly , and the universe itself has expanded by a factor of 1,100			1
the light has cooled so much that we ca n't see it , but @entity13 can detect subtle variations in temperature , which give scientists a wealth of information			1
by subtle , we mean about one - hundred - millionth of a degree			2
the colors in the temperature map image that scientists released thursday were arbitrarily chosen to show these intensity variations , @entity24 said			2
@entity78 means a little bit warmer than average , blue means cooler than average , and white is average			0
@entity13 data also suggest that our universe has more dark matter than previously thought			1
a full 26.8 % appears to be dark matter , an invisible phenomenon that scientists have only been able to detect indirectly ; experiments both in space and at the @entity89 are hoping to pin it down			2
how particle smasher and space telescopes relate it appears that ordinary matter -- all of the stuff that we can see , such as planets and stars -- makes up only 4.9 % of all the universe			2
the rest of the universe is an even more mysterious phenomenon called dark energy , which has also never been detected and appears to be in less abundance than researchers thought			2
scientists said the rate at which the universe is expanding , based on these observations , is 67.15 kilometers per second per megaparsec , a unit of vast distance in space ( 1 megaparsec = 3.3 million light years )			1
that 's significantly less than what had been calculated previously ( 73.8 km / sec / mpc )			0
this number , known as the @entity118 constant , describes the acceleration of the stretching of spacetime			0
the discrepancy between these @entity118 constants will likely attract a lot of attention in the scientific community and is one of the most exciting parts of the new data , said @entity129 , a scientist with the @entity13 mission based at the @entity131			1
" the hope would be that this is actually pointing toward some deficiency in the models , or some extra physics that we 're not aware of , and maybe spark a whole new research direction , " @entity129 said			0
one theory that could be explored is that the nature of dark energy , which scientists think is causing the accelerated expansion of the universe , is different from the simplest human - calculated models			1
is dark energy increasing with time over some volume of space ? that 's a radical theory , though , @entity129 said , and there are other possibilities			0
another anomaly of these results is that temperature fluctuations are not uniform across the sky map			0
there are more variations in one direction than in another			0
" perhaps we could say that our universe has thrown us a curve ball , and it rarely fails to surprise us , " said @entity159 , @entity13 scientist at @entity26 's @entity25			1
scientists ran 10 million computer simulations and chose from among them the best match to the new data , @entity129 said			1
out of those , they found a good match describing important statistics about the universe			0
the @entity13 telescope is aboard a spacecraft that launched in may 2009			1
it is not circling the @entity173 but orbits a point in the @entity175 called the second @entity176			0
the @entity13 mission helps to nail down many of the parameters that other experiments must know to explore aspects of the universe , such as its expansion history , @entity129 said			2
new analyses are based on the first 15.5 months of data from this mission , which is run principally by the @entity14			0
@entity26 is a partner of the project			0
@entity13 represents the third generation of attempts to map the cosmic microwave background			2
the first was @entity192 , launched in 1989 , followed by @entity193 , launched in 2001			0
comparing the resulting maps shows just how much better the maps have gotten with each successive satellite			0
" this is a beautiful illustration of how science works , " @entity24 said			0
" make a measurement , learn from it , make a better measurement , learn from it			0
" more space and science news from @entity206 @entity205			0

new images from a space telescope allow scientists to map how the universe evolved
@entity13 space telescope shows with better - than - ever precision first light of universe
the light is technically from 380,000 years after the @entity17
new data suggest universe is 100 million years older than scientists thought
