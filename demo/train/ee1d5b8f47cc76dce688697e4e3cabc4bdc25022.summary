-- @entity2 's first public housing blocks built to be environmentally sustainable have become the testing ground for future projects			1
from afar , the high - rises of @entity6 look unremarkable , but they are the first large - scale experiment to make public housing eco-friendly in @entity2 , a tropical city - state that is hot year - round			1
over 80 % of @entity2 's residents live in public housing , called @entity10 , after the government agency that builds them			1
" what we have done is that we put in various eco friendly features that helps in terms of capitalizing on the wind , enhancing greenery , reducing energy consumption , water usage , how to promote waste recycling , et cetera , all in one development , " said @entity13 , the project director , @entity14			2
the eco-friendly methods range from commonplace and practical to highly innovative			1
plant - covered roofs naturally lower the buildings ' temperature , and the towers ' orientation , facing away from the sun , helps too			0
painting the buildings white helps keep them cool and bring in sunlight			0
but white walls also look dirty more quickly , so the government is testing self - cleaning paint , which breaks down grime as it is triggered by sun exposure			2
@entity41 , the director of @entity43 's environment sustainability research team says the project 's variety of experiments will have wider implications for future housing in @entity2			1
" @entity6 is in fact a living laboratory for us , " said @entity41			0
" this is where we test bed a lot of urban solutions for us to identify which of those are workable and for us to adopt , for us to introduce more to our public housing , " inside the apartments , tap water that goes down the drain is used to flush toilets			2
solar energy powers elevators , lighting and water pumps			0
and various indicators placed around the buildings , like the ones found in the elevators that show the amount of solar energy being outputted , provide constant reminders to the residents of the different lifestyle they are living			0
but being eco-friendly comes at a higher price -- the sustainable buildings cost 7 % more to build than traditional apartments			0
the cost concerns have also sparked fiscal innovation , pushing the government to think of ways to make the eco-friendly features less expensive			2
one solution has been to lease , instead of buy , the building 's solar panels from private companies			1
" it 's very difficult for the government to continuously provide the funding			0
so what we have done is that we will try to partner with the private industry , " said @entity13			0
under the scheme , the government subsidizes start - up costs , while the solar energy companies install the panels , maintain them and sell back the energy to the power providers to recoup their costs .			1

@entity6 is @entity2 's first large - scale experiment to make public housing eco-friendly
the sustainable features range from practical to highly innovative
the government is leasing solar panels in a partner scheme with private *manufacturers*
it is hoped the project 's variety of experiments will have wider implications
