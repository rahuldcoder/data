@entity0 -- bowing to intense pressure from local residents , authorities in a southwestern @entity5 city abandoned plans to build a controversial billion - dollar chemical plant , the local government announced tuesday afternoon			1
earlier -- defying government orders -- residents of @entity13 , in @entity14 , continued to rally against the planned construction of a molybdenum copper plant despite an official pledge to halt the project , a protester told @entity1			1
the crowd on the streets thinned considerably after anti-riot police forcibly broke up thousands of protesting residents monday afternoon , said the protester , who asked that her name not be used for fear of government reprisal			2
widely circulated images on @entity5 social media sites showed police dispersing unarmed protesters with batons and tear gas , and included images of residents -- including women and the elderly -- covered in blood			0
in several statements , the @entity13 government said 13 residents suffered minor injuries in the clashes monday but denied anyone had died			1
warning residents to end the " illegal protests " immediately , authorities also defended police actions as a last - resort response to an increasingly unruly mob			2
the demonstration started late sunday , two days after officials broke ground on the controversial $ 1.6 billion @entity54 project , which they insisted had passed all environmental evaluations			0
unconvinced local residents , worried about long - term pollution caused by the heavy metal plant , started gathering in the city center to demand the construction be stopped , according to government statements			1
they were concerned about health problems caused by potentially substantial releases of various toxic pollutants into the local environment			1
those pollutants are released into air through smoke , and into ground and water supplies through the slag waste , a byproduct of a refinery 's production process that often includes elements like arsenic			0
despite rainy weather , the crowd swelled monday to thousands as angry residents took to the streets , chanting slogans and unfurling banners that read " protect @entity13 's environment and give us back our beautiful home , " according to photos and videos posted online by protesters			1
after the mayor 's promise to suspend construction failed to reassure the crowd , some demonstrators hurled water bottles and potted plants at police and overturned official vehicles , forcing officers to disperse the crowd with tear gas and stun grenades , the government said			2
but @entity5 residents on the country 's social media sites appear to have overwhelmingly supported protesters and their cause , and condemned the local government for its crackdown			2
many have also applauded @entity13 business owners who posted " no police allowed " signs outside their restaurants and stores after monday 's violent clashes			1
in a subtle sign of its dissatisfaction over local authorities ' handling of the situation , the government in @entity0 has so far remained largely silent , continuing to allow messages and images of the protest to be uploaded online			0
experts say the @entity13 episode has again highlighted the rising danger in @entity5 's behind - closed - doors environmental evaluation process			2
" this is a typical case in which the lack of public participation in the decision - making process leads to greater confusion and conflicts between government and the general public , " said @entity128 , a prominent environmentalist and head of the @entity0 - based @entity130			0
" in this case , the ideal solution is to re-evaluate the whole project to set an example for the future			0
" " another problem is that there 's no guarantee our existing regulations can be faithfully implemented , " he added			0
" we 've had similar cases before and now apparently the public awareness has grown significantly			0
" the protest in @entity13 is the latest example of @entity5 's urban residents -- long considered the main beneficiaries of the government 's economic reforms -- banding together , often via the @entity157 , to defend their rights			1
last august , a large protest prompted authorities in the northeastern port city of @entity162 to shut down a controversial chemical plant that produced paraxylene ( @entity165 ) , an allegedly carcinogenic compound used in the production of polyester films and fabrics			0
in 2008 , residents in @entity171 worried about radiation risks took to the streets to protest the construction of a high - speed rail line using the magnetic levitation technology , forcing the government to suspend the project indefinitely			1
and in 2007 , residents in the southeastern city of @entity181 marched against a local @entity165 plant , which eventually moved out of the city .			0

residents were worried about the possible release of toxic pollutants from the plant
the @entity13 government says 13 *people* were injured in clashes monday
*popular* protests succeeded in closing other chemical plants and *derailing* a high - speed rail line
