-- @entity1 can help you find drugstores and bars , but the @entity6 digital assistant is clueless when it comes to the locations of abortion clinics , according to the @entity10			1
the advocacy group this week launched an online petition asking people to send e-mails to @entity15 saying that " if @entity1 can tell us about @entity18 , it should not provide bad or no information about contraceptives or abortion care			1
send a message to @entity15 : fix @entity1			1
" " although it is n't clear that @entity15 is intentionally trying to promote an anti-choice agenda , it is distressing that @entity1 can point you to @entity18 , but not the @entity28 , or help you find an escort , but not an abortion clinic , " the group wrote in a blog post wednesday			1
" we 're confident that the developers at @entity15 want to provide @entity6 users with accurate information			2
" @entity15 said thursday the omission was not intentional : " our customers want to use @entity1 to find out all types of information and while it can find a lot , it does n't always find what you want , " @entity15 spokeswoman @entity36 said			1
" these are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone			0
it simply means that as we bring @entity1 from beta to a final product , we find places where we can do better and we will in the coming weeks			2
" in an informal test by @entity0 , @entity1 was able to provide some information about reproductive health services , including where you can buy a condom , but she still could not answer the question , " where can i get an abortion ? " the digital assistant 's reply : " sorry , i could n't find any abortion clinics			1
" when asked about @entity62 , a group that provides reproductive health services , including abortions , @entity1 was able to locate a nearby clinic			0

" the @entity1 abortion questions started to become a point of online conversation this week , with bloggers raising the point that @entity1 was unable to locate abortion clinics			1
" if abortion information is plentifully available on the interwebs , and @entity1 is pulling those types of requests from the @entity86 , why does @entity1 not have an answer about birth control or abortion ? " one blogger wrote on a site called the @entity81			0
on a blog called @entity90 , @entity90 wrote : " in @entity92 , @entity1 does n't know what @entity93 is and , asked for emergency contraception , offers up a @entity96 results page of definitions			0
" @entity1 pulls from other internet services to answer questions from @entity6 owners			0
for small business listings , such as abortion clinics , the voice - controlled assistant searches @entity105			2
it looks to @entity96 for information that would be contained in standard web searches .			0
