-- when @entity3 took the stage at the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , the @entity2 front man told the audience he had embraced his " inner nerd			1
" " exit the rock star , " @entity3 said , " enter the evidence - based activist - the factivist			2
" the speech was a call to action			0
extreme global poverty has already been cut in half over the past 20 years , from 43 % in 1990 to 21 % in 2010			2
@entity3 said that if the current trajectory can be continued , extreme poverty could be virtually eliminated by 2030			1
@entity19 : @entity3 : 8 talks that give me hope there has been astonishing progress in other areas of human development			2
more than 8 million people are on life - saving antiretroviral drugs , compared with only 200,000 a decade ago			0
in eight @entity31 countries , malaria deaths have been cut by 75 % ; the rate of child mortality for those under 5 is down by 2.65 million deaths a year since 2000			0
that 's all great news , but there are two things that should give us pause			0
first , not enough people have any idea of the successes in the fight against global diseases and poverty			0
" it drives me nuts , " said @entity3 , " that most people do n't seem to know this news			0
" @entity19 : what does extreme poverty look like today ? second , the gains the world has made are in jeopardy			1
they could be reversed with cuts to the budgets for vital institutions like the @entity59 ; they could be stopped in their tracks if the world allows corruption , inequality , apathy and inertia to dictate the pace -- or lack of it -- of progress			0
@entity19 : do we need more worldwide development goals ? but if the world keeps the promises that it has made to itself to really fight extreme poverty and preventable disease , then nothing is impossible			1
@entity3 argued that if we used transparency -- which tackles corruption like nothing else -- and technology , we can get closer to the " @entity82 , " where extreme poverty is virtually eliminated by 2028			1
then this generation would be what @entity84 once challenged it to be : the " @entity87 " that did away with -- in @entity84 's words , the " most awful offense against humanity " that extreme poverty represents			1
@entity19 : the quest to end poverty @entity100 , @entity3 said at @entity5 , is a virtuous , data - based virus , and challenged his audience to " spread it , share it , pass it on ... by doing so , you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe is the greatest journey ever taken -- the ever - demanding journey of equality			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity109 .			0
