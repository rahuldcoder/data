-- @entity1 sent residents along the @entity3 running for cover this week			0
for those households that count animals among their family members , the storm brought an extra worry : what do i do with my pet ? the @entity14 family of @entity15 , @entity16 , was faced with that potentially life - altering question as the storm approached			1
the @entity20 ' 5 - year - old cockapoo , @entity21 , is black with a white chest and , at only 12 pounds , the runt of her litter			2
" she is also my fourth daughter , " said @entity14			0
the family 's neighborhood was one of the first in the area to evacuate before @entity1 hit , so they searched for options to keep @entity21 with them while they cleared out			2
" we went to the first shelter and i told them , ' we have a dog at home , can she come here ? ' they said no. make sure she has food and water , leave her , " said @entity14			1
" when they said leave her , i just could n't help it , i cried			0
" include pets in your emergency plan @entity48 residents faced the same dilemma seven years ago			1
@entity50 left countless family pets dead , stranded or homeless			1
when faced with the decision to leave their animals behind , some people decided to stay , and some may have perished because of that choice , said @entity56 of the @entity57			1
" people would never evacuate a home and leave behind their children or their spouse , " said @entity56 , senior director of field investigations and response at the @entity57			1
" pets are family members			2
society continues to evolve , and local governments know now that if they do n't consider the animals , they may be putting residents in danger			2
" lessons learned on the @entity48 brought about the @entity72			0
the @entity73 made it mandatory for local and state governments to include plans for pets in their emergency procedures and opened the gates for @entity81 funds to be put toward the welfare of animals in disaster zones			1
" after @entity50 and with the @entity73 , we have tremendous support now from the @entity87 , @entity81 and the federal government that just did not exist in 2005 , " said @entity56			0
@entity89 of the @entity90 said local governments have been encouraging people to take pets with them when they evacuate , which helps prevent some of the dangers pets faced during @entity50			1
both animal welfare agencies applauded @entity95 for mandating that all city shelters and transit allow pets entrance leading up to and during the superstorm			1
" it is a model that we hope the rest of the nation follows in the future , " said @entity56			0
the @entity73 gives first responders and pet owners more to work with , but ultimately local governments must decide what provisions to put in place			1
that could mean anything from relying on local animal shelters to investing in mobile pet rescue units			1
@entity50 , @entity114 survivors offer advice to @entity1 victims " most animal shelters run at 100 % capacity even when it is not a disaster situation , which means they could n't possibly take in private pets			1
but under the @entity73 , that state will have fulfilled their obligation , " said @entity89			0
the second line of defense comes in the form of volunteer networks and non-government groups			2
the @entity57 , in partnership with @entity131 , has set up a distribution center in @entity133 , @entity95 , and contributed more than 4,000 supplies to local rescue groups , primarily in @entity95 , @entity136 and @entity137			1
in @entity95 and on @entity138 alone , the @entity57 now has more than 400 owned animals sheltered in 40 evacuation centers			1
in addition to shelter assistance , helping animals means getting out in the field			2
the @entity57 has two transport trailers and three water rescue teams on standby			2
the @entity147 has responders in @entity16 , @entity95 , @entity149 and @entity150			2
they are joined by hundreds of other organizations and many dedicated volunteers			0
when animal rescue groups ca n't get out in the field , they increasingly turn to social media			0
in @entity158 , @entity95 , @entity136 , @entity159 and @entity137 , storm refugees could find pet - friendly shelters by following the @entity147 on its media platforms			1
@entity162 has allowed for quick communication			0
when the @entity147 found out via @entity162 that a @entity158 town instructed residents to leave pets behind during a mandatory evacuation , the society sprung into action and persuaded local officials to open up an animal shelter to owned pets and change the evacuation notice			1
" that community and those officials should be commended for turning on a dime to accommodate the needs of their community , " said @entity89			0
local response to the @entity73 may vary , but there are universal guidelines that all pet owners should follow during a storm , said @entity56 : " keep your pets on a leash and close to you			1
there may be contaminated water and spoiled food			0
it is critical that pet owners should have a backup number outside of your region available			2
make sure you have a crate and leash , so you can always move quickly			0
" back in @entity15 , @entity14 eventually found a shelter for her whole family , including @entity21			0
as the clouds gathered overhead , a volunteer piled the family into his car to retrieve their dog , just before the worst of the storm hit			0
" i do n't know what we would have done , " @entity14 said			0
" when the girls got to see her , it was amazing			0
" how to help have you been affected by @entity1 ? share your experiences in the comments section below			0

if your pet is lost in a disaster , the first point of contact should be your local shelter
report stranded pets in @entity95 to the @entity57 's *24* - hour *hotline* at *347* - *573* - 1561
