the quarterly report to @entity11 noted that the military , political and economic gains made in the five - year - old war remain " fragile , reversible and uneven , " and that @entity16 jihadists loyal to @entity17 in @entity5 remain capable of high - profile attacks			1
but civilian deaths have dropped from a peak of nearly 4,000 a month from december 2006 to january 2007 to about 500 a month as of may , and @entity22 troop deaths have dropped from 126 in may 2007 to an all - time low of 19 in may 2008			0

@entity22 troop deaths and civilian deaths spiked in march , when @entity5 battled militia forces loyal to shiite cleric @entity39 in @entity40			1
at the end of march , an operation in @entity44 by @entity22 and @entity5 forces to clear out insurgents firing rockets into the @entity41 also kept the death toll up , according to the report			1

@entity110 has denied @entity22 allegations it is supporting insurgent factions within @entity5			2
but @entity22 and @entity5 troops have discovered @entity110 weapons inside @entity5 , including @entity110 made roadside bombs -- and during the fighting in @entity40 , large stashes of @entity110 - made weapons were found with manufacture dates on them as recent as this year , according to @entity22 military officials			2
the report said the @entity5 government continues to press the @entity110 , who deny blame			0
may 2008 marked a sharp drop in high - profile attacks from @entity17 , according to the report			0
attacks in may hit a two - year low , about 70 percent lower than the peak in march 2007			0
