@entity1 , @entity0 -- when speaking to the tech - savvy attendees of @entity5 , it does n't hurt to lead with a web reference -- even if you 're the former vice president			1
" our democracy has been hacked , " said @entity8			1
" it no longer works , in the main , to serve the interests of our people			0
" @entity8 joined @entity15 , the mind behind @entity17 and founding president of @entity19 , on a two - man panel at the digital festival monday during which both decried the influence of money in politics and pointed to the internet as the answer			1
@entity15 , whose @entity17 nearly single - handedly started a revolution in how people acquire and consume music , alluded to his past during the hour - long talk before an overflow crowd of about 5,000			1
" the internet is incredibly good at taking money out of existing industries , " he told the capacity audience of more than 3,000			0
" my hope is that the @entity26 can do for the political process what it did for the copyright industries			0
" @entity15 is a backer and board member of @entity44 , a site started in 2010 to help users parlay their social networks into political activism			1
in 2007 , he also co-founded @entity48 , a site that applies similar principles to fundraising for nonprofits and has raised $ 40 million for over 27,000 organizations			0
@entity8 , who in addition to his well - documented environmental activism is a technology investor and founder of @entity57 , pointed to recent examples of web - enabled activism -- from the @entity61 's role in democratic reform in @entity63 to successful protests of the @entity65 after it pulled funding for @entity67			1
but he and @entity15 noted that , in the next generation of web activism , there needs to be a way to strengthen engagement beyond merely putting a digital signature on an online petition or clicking " like " on @entity19			2
" it 's not enough to take that small action online , " @entity15 said			2
" a referral or notification is not really the same thing as showing up at a protest or actually opening up your wallet			0
" while blasting the @entity84 's ruling in the @entity86 case that allowed for big - money " super pacs " in political campaigns -- " a @entity84 i have not always agreed with , " said the 2000 presidential nominee -- @entity8 said that successful political activism online can decrease the influence of money from special interests			1
" when we win the conversation , then the pressure can be put on the politicians and elected officials to do the right thing , " @entity8 said			2
@entity15 said the way online communities rose up to ultimately derail the @entity104 ( which many felt would have clamped down on web freedom ) is heartening , even if he 's not sure exactly what form future efforts will take			2
( he called apathy in tech circles " somewhat pathetic " before that , but that @entity104 " awakened that sleeping giant			0
" " there are a lot of really smart hackers in this audience , " @entity15 said			0
" we need to put our heads together and take control of this system ... before the slow - thinking incumbents ... know what 's happening			0
