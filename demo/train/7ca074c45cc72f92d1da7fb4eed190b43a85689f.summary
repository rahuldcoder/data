-- @entity2 driver @entity1 fears @entity3 is in danger of becoming a " lottery " and says it could lose its credibility			1
this season has produced six different winners in six races and , while conceding this was good for spectators , the two - time world champion told @entity0 it had produced disquiet in the @entity3 paddock			1
" it 's a fantastic season , it 's so unpredictable			1
i think people stand in front of the tv , with some surprises every race			0
it 's good for the audience , it 's good for the sport to bring attention to the races , " said the @entity22 , who leads the world championship by three points , with 14 rounds remaining			1
" on the other hand we can lose credibility			0
we can not lose that the best teams , the best drivers , the best strategies win the races , because at the moment from the outside it seems that in every race anyone can win			2
" it does n't matter the talent , it does n't matter the team , the performance -- it 's like a lottery			2
what you achieve in @entity3 is not by chance			2
we need to make clear that if you win a race , it 's because you did something better			0
and i do n't think at the moment that this is clear for everybody			0
" @entity1 's position at the head of the standings could not have been predicted at the start of this season , when he and his @entity65 team publicly doubted the race pace of the two ferraris			1
" we were not happy with the car at the beginning of the season			0
we were not rich with the expectations and the team tried to understand the problems as soon as possible and tried to make the changes , " the 30 - year - old said			0
" they seemed to work but even if we are happy now with the position and with the points we achieved , we still know and are honest with ourselves knowing that we are not quick enough at the moment still			0
there is still plenty of work to do but we think a strong reaction is still to come from @entity2			2
" @entity3 teams battle from race to race to make minor adjustments which often have a big impact on performance , and @entity1 gave credit to @entity2 's technicians for improving the cars			1
" we changed mainly aerodynamics			0
@entity3 is dominated by aerodynamics and we had some areas of the car that were not working exactly as they were designed , so we did some tweaks there , " he said			2
" we changed some philosophies of working in the car and it started to work			0
but as i said it 's not enough , we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car			0
" while @entity1 has shown his ability in an underperforming car , teammate @entity107 is under increasing pressure to retain his place			1
the @entity113 , a world championship runner - up in 2008 , has recovered from serious head injuries suffered the following year but has very much been the number two driver since @entity1 arrived from @entity116 in 2010			1
" we know that there has been some coincidences and some bad luck and moments in particular races that he did n't score points he deserved , " @entity1 said			1
" we know that in practice and in qualifying we are much closer , we are fighting , we are together in some of the first corners , but then some factors make him always in some troubles , some incidents , and he lost points			0
" but he has the talent , he has full support from our bosses , from me , from everybody in the team and we know the talent from @entity107			1
we know that before later he will shine			0
" @entity1 became @entity3 's youngest double world champion when he won back - to - back titles with @entity116 in 2005 - 06 , but he was usurped by @entity140 's @entity139 last year			1
now the @entity142 driver has been tipped to follow @entity1 's footsteps and join the most successful team in the sport 's history , reportedly in 2014			1
" ( it 's ) only speculation			0
every year in @entity2 it is like this , " @entity1 said			1
" i had this when i was with @entity116 in the past			0
every year around summer always the speculations : ' @entity1 will go to @entity2			1
' i answered many questions over the years and now when i joined @entity2 it is the opposite			2
" every year someone is coming to @entity2 , it has been like this			2
i think it is something you have to deal also when you are in @entity2			2
" @entity1 is hoping , despite his car 's weaknesses , that he can deliver @entity2 's first drivers ' title since @entity166 in 2007			1
" things are complex and not straightforward and i think it will be quite tight for the championship , " said @entity1 , who is 25 points ahead of @entity166 , back on the grid this year with @entity169 after a two - year absence			1
" there is not one car dominating the season as we saw in the last couple of years			0
i think we will be there			0
i do n't know if we will be champions but we will fight until the last race , i am sure			0

@entity1 tells @entity0 that @entity3 may be becoming too unpredictable
