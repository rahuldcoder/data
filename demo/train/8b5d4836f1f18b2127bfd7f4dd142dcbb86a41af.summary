maybe it seems like the fastest way for a gadget - and - technology blogger to commit career suicide , but @entity4 gave up the internet at midnight tuesday			1
@entity4 , who was and still is a senior editor at a tech news site called @entity7 , plans to stay offline for a full year			1
when he needs to post something to the website that employs him , he will hand his editors a thumb drive with his stories saved in offline files			1
if he needs to look up a phone number , he 'll get on the phone and start calling people -- who hopefully know people who know the person that he 's trying to reach for an interview			1
there 's no other way without access to professional websites and directories , he said			2
" i 'm going to try to use the six degrees of separation a little bit , " he said on tuesday afternoon in an interview -- by phone , of course			2
" i have a lot of co-workers and they know a lot of people and so anybody i can get a phone number for i 'll call that person and maybe they have a phone number for another person			2
so i 'll have to follow that sort of chain			2
" why go to all this trouble ? for years , the idea of a digital sabbatical has appealed to the hyper - connected set -- people who spend most of their days in front of computer screens , checking blogs , reading @entity52 and somehow trying to figure out how to get their work done in between			2
at the office , they dodge dozens of click - me - now messages per minute , each demanding instant attention			2
even away from work , phones chime and vibrate to the point that , according to a market research study from @entity64 , the buzz of a vibrating phone is now one of the top three " most powerful , affecting sounds " -- after a baby giggling and the @entity71 chime , he wrote in the @entity72			2
depending on your perspective , it may be either surprising or fitting that a technology blogger would get so caught up in the online tornado that he would quit , completely , and for a full year			1
on one hand , the @entity79 is @entity4 's passion and livelihood			1
" i love the @entity79 , " he said			2
" it allows people to interact in really deep and meaningful ways and to create awesome things and do awesome things			2
i think it 's a wonderful invention and i have no ill will against it			0
" but on the other hand , he also was semi-required to be online almost all the time			0
" i 've been on the internet for the majority of the hours of my waking life , " he says in a video posted on @entity7			1
over the years , that started to take its toll			0
longer - term , big - brainpower projects , like a sci - fi novel he 's writing , fell to the wayside of quicker , easier distractions , he said			0
so he wants to try life without all that			1
" i just want to know how it 's impacting me and the parts of it that might not be good or might not be good for me , " he said in the interview			0
" that 's why it 's an experiment , not an indictment			0
" when i spoke with @entity4 , he 'd only been off the internet for about 12 hours			1
with that little time elapsed , it was of course impossible for him to pass broad judgments on his year - off - the - @entity79 plan			1
before he pulled the plug , he said he " really tried to overdose " on all things @entity79			0
he played several online games at once , responded to a flurry of @entity52 messages and e-mails and joined a chat on @entity126 , where some commenters questioned the value of his project , calling it a " publicity stunt			0
" " i have to recommend against it , " one person wrote , saying he or she had tried a similar experiment a few years ago			0
" ... it became rather dull rather quickly			0
" at 12:01 a.m. on tuesday he found himself in the @entity7 's office grappling with that potential for dullness			1
" as soon as i unplugged i literally had nothing to do , " he said			0
what he did was find co-workers who were playing video games ( offline , so that 's allowed )			0
he joined them for a bit and then went back home , where he had an unusually long conversation with his roommate and listened to some records			0
they stayed up talking until 3 a.m. , he said , and " i was completely in the moment and having a good time			0
" that may not have happened with the internet around , he said			1
before he quit the @entity79 , @entity4 said his relationships were suffering because of his digital fixations : " a lot of times i 'm on a computer or i 'm on my phone and i 'm a little distracted by that			1
sometimes i get frustrated at somebody that 's trying to talk to me because maybe there 's something i 'm trying to complete on the computer and i 'm trying to have the conversation			0
so i do n't really do well at either thing			1
" @entity4 quit drinking cold turkey last year , and did the same when he wanted to give up gluten for a few months			1
it 's easier to go all the way with something than to do it in phases , he said			0
he plans to spend much of his year reading some of the best books in history ( he downloaded a list from a university 's syllabus before the no - @entity79 deadline ) and writing more			1
you can check back for updates on @entity7 , where he will post diary entries about twice per week			1
and who knows , he said , maybe this will make a book			0
" if this goes well i also want to write a book about my experiences without the @entity79 , " he said , " but so far i have n't had any experiences without the @entity79			1
" well , that 's about to change .			0
