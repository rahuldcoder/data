-- @entity2 protesters geared up for a third week of demonstrations on monday as @entity5 lawmakers were again missing from the state capitol , protesting a bill that would curb collective bargaining rights for most public workers			1
the state 's 14 @entity5 senators have fled to neighboring @entity12 to prevent a quorum of 20 votes needed for a budget repair bill that would require public employees -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums			1
collective bargaining would be limited to wages , though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval			1
" there are plenty of states that do not have collective bargaining , " @entity28 gov. @entity28 said monday			1
" we have a right to do this with the statutes and that 's what we 're doing			0
" @entity38 leaders have agreed to pay more for benefits , but oppose restricting bargaining rights that the governor argues is needed for meaningful fiscal reforms			1
@entity2 is " broke , " and unions use their power to block necessary cost - saving measures , @entity28 said sunday on @entity47 's " @entity46			1
" " it 's about time somebody stood up and told the truth in this state , and said , ' here 's our problem , here 's the solution , ' and acted on it , " he said			1
" because if we do n't , we fail to make a commitment to the future			0
" moments later on the program , @entity61 president @entity60 assailed @entity28			0
" this is n't about the budget crisis , " he said , adding that @entity28 's arguments have " migrated " as his justifications have been refuted			1
" governors that are willing to sit down and work with their employees can work out problems , " @entity60 said			0
" we can solve them			0
but that 's not what governor @entity28 is doing			1
he says , ' i wo n't talk to you			0
' " @entity2 is confronted with a $ 137 million budget shortfall by june 30			1
the embattled governor has defended his budget repair bill , saying the measures are needed to head off a $ 3.6 billion budget gap by 2013 that could result in thousands of layoffs			1
the state had faced a suggested friday deadline to balance the budget , but the crucial date is march 16 , officials said			2
meanwhile , some of the hundreds of demonstrators who had filled the @entity91 building -- gathering inside the rotunda in daily protest of the proposed legislation -- had left the building by monday at the request of state police , said @entity99 spokeswoman @entity98			2
" of those who remained , all but a few have voluntarily complied with the request of law enforcement to remain in a designed area of the building , " @entity100 said			0
" no additional protesters will be allowed into the building until this situation is resolved			0
" hundreds gathered outside the @entity91 building later on monday , chanting , " let us in ! " their yells were met by a group of protesters who remained inside , chanting , " let them in ! " representative @entity113 , the @entity5 leader in @entity2 's state assembly , called the lock - down unacceptable			1
" politicians may not always enjoy hearing what the citizens of this state have to say , but it is wrong to block elected officials from their constituents , " @entity116 said			2
" there are a number of scheduled meetings in the building today and the public has a right to attend them and visit their legislators			0
" a pro-union political action committee called " @entity2 " filed a lawsuit monday in a @entity136 @entity135 against the state of @entity2 for not letting people to enter the capitol building , said the group 's director @entity140			1
authorities had initially given demonstrators until late sunday afternoon to leave the building , saying it needed to be cleaned after roughly two weeks of protests			0
" we 're going through an extensive cleaning process tonight , " @entity2 capitol police chief @entity145 said late sunday			2
" we 're hoping to get through that			0
" and while many people left , others defied the order and remained inside			0
some said they were willing to risk arrest in a conflict that has become a flash point in the nation 's debate around labor unions			0
the budget bill was passed by assembly lawmakers early friday and must now clear the @entity160 , where absent @entity5 have stalled the legislative process while awaiting a compromise outside state borders			1
@entity28 has called on the lawmakers to " come back and do their job , " sending state patrol officers to @entity167 homes in an effort to pressure their return			0
" if we fail to pass this bill by tuesday , we lose $ 165 million worth of savings			2
if we continue down that path we start seeing layoffs , " he warned			0
@entity176 , president of the @entity177 told @entity0 sunday that workers in @entity2 have sent a message to @entity28 that " ' we understand and we will do our fair share			2
' " but @entity28 is sending a different message , @entity176 said : " ' i 'm just taking away your voice at work			0
' " in the long term , that message " is ridiculous because collective bargaining is the way to increase quality , " she said			1
president @entity190 also weighed in on monday , appearing to allude to the growing controversy by telling a group of governors that while " everybody should be prepared to give up something " in the face of new budget realities , " i do n't think it does anybody any good when public employees are vilified " or their rights are infringed upon			1
while the president has publicly expressed support for those fighting to keep collective bargaining in @entity2 , he has not joined them at protests			1
@entity28 's spokesman , @entity207 , quickly responded , calling the president 's comments a " misunderstanding			2
" " i 'm sure the president knows that the average federal worker pays twice as much for health insurance as what we are asking for in @entity2 , " @entity207 said in a written statement			2
@entity60 of the @entity61 insisted that @entity190 , who faces federal budget challenges , is " doing it the right way			1
" " he 's not taking on workers like @entity28 is and trying to take away their ability to come together and negotiate a middle - class way of life , " @entity60 said			2
@entity28 is expected to give the state 's annual budget address to a joint session of the state legislature tuesday at 4 p.m. ( 5 @entity228 )			1
but the showdown over budgets and bargaining rights is not limited to the @entity232			0
in @entity235 , @entity5 lawmakers -- much like those from @entity232 -- remained in @entity12 on monday , extending the stalemate over a @entity237 - backed proposal they say will restrict workers ' rights			1
@entity237 house members claim they have scrapped a " right - to - work " bill that would have prevented private - sector unions from requiring workers to pay dues for representation			2
but @entity235 @entity5 are skeptical			1
" you 'll forgive us if we do n't take them at their word , " said party spokesman @entity248			0
" we were out ( of the state ) today and chances are we will be out tomorrow			0
" @entity248 said negotiations between @entity237 and @entity5 had come to a virtual stand - still monday			1
the state 's @entity237 governor , @entity257 -- who ended collective bargaining with public unions soon after his election in 2005 -- has defended the bill as necessary cost - cutting measure			1
the former budget director under @entity265 , @entity257 -- who is often described as a potential 2012 presidential candidate -- may now be facing a more difficult task in scaling back the negotiating rights of private unions			0
the state assembly met on monday , but lacked the two - thirds quorum needed to pass legislation			2
lawmakers face a april 29 deadline to balance the state budget , officials said			2
in @entity277 , a budget bill supported by another @entity237 governor , @entity279 , prompted thousands of labor - backed demonstrators to descend on @entity281 to protest a proposal that would curtail union bargaining rights			1
@entity284 , who command a 23 - 10 majority -- currently lack enough votes to pass another controversial budget bill affecting public workers			1
the proposal , known as @entity290 , would prevent employees from negotiating health care , pensions and automatic pay raises based on seniority			0
the measure would also ban strikes for all public workers -- rather than just those involved in public safety -- but was recently amended to allow state employees to negotiate salaries , according to state sen. @entity302			0
" we ca n't sustain the contracts that have clogged up the arteries of government for the last 30 years , " said @entity303 , a spokesman for the @entity304			0
" we 're allowing unions to negotiate terms that should be the employers ' decision			0
" @entity303 said @entity237 lawmakers view the measure as " long - term reform to restructure state government			2
" he says its an effort to " trim around the edges to make government leaner and more efficient			0
" but opposition groups say the bill is anti-union			0
crowds of union supporters -- who last week surrounded the state capitol chanting , " @entity326 " -- are expected to again board @entity281 - bound buses in protest of the measure on tuesday			1
@entity5 had refused to put forth a single amendment after lawmakers described the proposal as " fatally flawed			0
" the next senate hearing on the measure is set to begin tuesday at 1p.m			1
