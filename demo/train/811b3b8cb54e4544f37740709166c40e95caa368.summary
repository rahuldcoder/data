@entity0 -- where were you on the night of july 15 ? you may not even remember , but for me it was an extraordinary evening , an evening of unimaginable triumph and unbearable tragedy			1
@entity8 testifies before a @entity10 subcommittee on april 29 , 2009			2
but i would not actually know everything that happened until the night was long over			1
a couple of weeks before july 15 , a friend who works with injured troops emailed me to say it was time for @entity8 's going away party			1
@entity8 is a young marine i first met a few years ago at @entity18 in @entity0 where he was recovering from a devastating @entity20 attack in @entity21			2
he had stepped on the roadside bomb and lost his entire body below the hips			2
the party being arranged was @entity8 's farewell to @entity8 is off to the rigors of @entity28			1
he 's says he 's itching to get into a courtroom			1
you need to remember the name @entity8			2
many of his friends believe @entity8 is such an amazing man that he will become president of the @entity35			2
if i had to bet , i 'd say it could happen			2
i would n't have missed the party for the world			0
i was touched that this tight - knit community of wounded warriors had included me in this very special , very intimate evening			0
there was a display of photos of @entity8 serving in @entity21			0
i suddenly realized i never knew how tall he was before the war			0
there were a few sniffles and wiping of eyes in the room for a @entity17 whose dream of service to his country ended within a few months of getting to @entity21			1
but sniffles did n't last long and the evening became one of hugs , laughter and good wishes ( and more than a few beers ) for a young @entity17 who had triumphed over what the war had dealt him			1
but my warm feelings did n't last long			0
the next day another source in the wounded troop community came to me in the @entity69 hallway with another tale			0
" you have to do something about the story of @entity75 , " he said			0
in the very hours we were celebrating @entity8 in @entity0 , tragedy was unfolding in @entity78			1
lt. col. @entity79 , a 53 - year old civil affairs officer who had dedicated his career to rebuilding war torn countries , was found dead in his car in the parking lot of @entity85 in @entity86 @entity78			1
colleagues of @entity75 's said prescription pills and notes he wrote to his family and wife , @entity92 , were found			1
a military source told me all indications are @entity75 took his own life			0
his devastated family understandably declined to talk publicly , and the military wo n't discuss the case citing privacy concerns			0
but friends and colleagues i spoke to confirmed that @entity75 had suffered multiple blast injuries to his brain from bomb attacks during several deployments over the years			1
watch @entity75 's struggle with his brain injuries Â» in october 2006 , @entity75 survived an attack in @entity21 that rendered him briefly unconscious			1
he was transferred to @entity109 but somehow talked the doctors into sending him back to the war zone			0
a week later , ill and confused , he was sent back to the @entity35			0
a close associate tells me that at first , despite being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury in @entity21 , some doctors thought @entity75 might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder			1
they did n't realize he had all the symptoms of traumatic brain injury			1
he had trouble talking , reasoning and remembering			0
he was sent to @entity85 in @entity86 so he could be near his family , but for the first few months he just sat in his room			0
fellow soldiers helped him with his bathing , dressing and eating			1
finally , @entity75 was assigned a case manager , and things began to move rapidly			0
he got therapy and was able to go home			0
but by all accounts from his friends , @entity75 had become seriously debilitated by the injuries to his brain			2
a private email shown to @entity1 revealed that @entity75 had been diagnosed with rapidly emerging alzheimer 's disease			1
the cumulative impact of all those bomb blasts were destroying his brain			2
colleagues say @entity75 knew he might have to move to an assisted living facility			0
@entity75 's doctors are not discussing his treatment because of privacy concerns			2
a colleague told me @entity75 was tired and in pain on the night of july 15			1
he was found in his car in the parking lot at the army hospital where he had spent so long trying to get better			1
but @entity75 will be remembered for all he did for others			0
even with all his suffering , he wanted to make sure other injured troops were helped			2
in april he and his wife @entity92 went to @entity153 to testify with other wounded warriors about their needs			0
sitting on that panel with @entity75 was @entity8 .			0

@entity1 's @entity158 celebrated a victory and *mourned* a loss on july 15
an injured @entity17 was celebrating getting into @entity28
on same night , a warrior with a traumatic brain injury was found dead in his car
