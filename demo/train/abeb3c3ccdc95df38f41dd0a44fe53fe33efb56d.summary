@entity0 -- shocking as it may sound , the seemingly endless federal bureaucracy can get confusing , especially when interpreting statutory procedure			0
when that happens , federal courts -- including the @entity6 -- by precedent normally give the government the benefit of the doubt , what is called " administrative deference			1
" that ambiguity was on display monday in an unusual legal dilemma : can a child conceived after the death of the biological father be eligible for survivor benefits under @entity20 ? the @entity22 administration thinks not , and a majority of justices -- almost by default -- appeared to agree during a spirited morning of oral arguments			1
" you lose if the statute is ambiguous , " said chief justice @entity27 to the lawyer for the surviving parent			0
" is there any reason we should n't conclude based on the last hour that it 's at least ambiguous ? " added justice @entity36 : " it 's a mess			1
" at issue is how the court should interpret the word " child " and whether state laws over wills and trusts are adequate to deal with evolving technology for in vitro fertilization			1
@entity47 developed esophageal cancer just months after marrying @entity49 in 1999			0
concerned the medical treatment could leave him sterile , @entity47 began depositing semen in a sperm bank			0
after his health improved , the couple conceived naturally and a son was born			2
but the man 's condition later worsened and @entity47 died in march 2002			1
the confusion lies in the fact his final will did not specify whether children born after his passing could be legally declared his survivors			0
but a separate notarized document from the @entity65 stated , " any children born to us , who were conceived by the use of our embryos , shall in all respects and for purposes , including but not limited to descent of property , be children of our bodies			2
" @entity49 underwent the in vitro fertilization procedure and 18 months after her husband 's death , twin children were born			1
she then applied for @entity20 survivor benefits , but the agency rejected the claim			1
an administrative judge concluded the " domicile at death " for @entity47 , the wage earner , was @entity84 , and that state did not provide for children conceived after the parent 's death			1
a federal appeals court then found for @entity92 , saying the twins were " children " within meaning of state law and @entity20 regulations			1
the agency then appealed to the @entity6 for review			1
the justices clearly appeared at odds over how to treat this relatively new category of offspring , and whether they should be in the same category as stepchildren or adopted children when deciding survivor benefits			1
@entity27 suggested " there is no clear answer			0
i mean , let 's take a situation where this type of reproduction is new , and the state legislatures have n't had a chance to decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for state intestacy ( inheritance ) law or not			2
" several of his colleagues searched for related scenarios that could guide them in this unusual instance			0
" let 's assume ms. @entity92 remarried but used her deceased husband 's sperm to birth two children			1
they are the biological children of the @entity65			0
would they qualify for survivor benefits even though she is now remarried ? " asked justice @entity129			1
" a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable , because i do n't see the words ' biological ' in the ( federal ) statute			0
i do n't see the word ' marriage ' directly , within the definition of ' child			2
' " justice @entity143 was more direct			0
federal policy " disfavors children who are born after the father has died			1
which is in accord with the title of the statute : survivors benefits , " he said			2
" what is at issue here is not whether children that have been born through artificial insemination get benefits			2
it 's whether children who are born after the father 's death gets benefits			1
@entity47 's attorney , said , " there is no question that children who are ... pro-conceived naturally in the marriage and are born after the father 's death are deemed to be dependents and receive benefits			1
" @entity129 jumped in : " i am interested as to what your definition of child is			2
is it just a biological offspring ? is it limited to a biological offspring born of a particular marriage ? but in what context ? " @entity165 struggled to respond			0
" what if the @entity47 twins were conceived four years after of the death in this case ? " asked @entity27			1
" would your argument be the same ? " " these children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died , " said justice @entity190			2
" if we look to other categories of children -- say , stepchildren , and there is also one for adopted children -- they qualify only if they had that status no less than nine months before the wage earner died , and adopted children there is also a limitation			0
the stepchild and the adopted child , there could never be any question of being born 18 months later			2
there is a time limit for the other children			0
and if @entity215 had thought about this problem , maybe it would put a time limit on this , too			0
" @entity165 did little to convince the court that advances in artificial insemination were something lawmakers could not have anticipated when they passed the @entity20 in 1939 and should not continue to hinder his client 's ability to seek benefits			1
" i think the problem is that we 're dealing with new technologies that @entity215 did n't develop -- was n't anticipating at the time			0
" a ruling by the court is expected by june , but it is not likely to have an immediate widespread impact			0
court records show only about 100 other federal benefit applicants in a similar situation as @entity47			0
but the justices could use this appeal to clarify what it means to be a " child " in relation to a parent and whether current state and federal law is flexible enough to incorporate a growing a range of technological conception possibilities			0
the case is @entity248 v. @entity47 ( 11 - 159 ) .			0

new : " it 's a mess , " @entity36 says
the @entity6 hears a case dealing with the child of a deceased father
the child was conceived by in vitro fertilization after the father died
the question is whether the child can be eligible for @entity20 survivor benefits
