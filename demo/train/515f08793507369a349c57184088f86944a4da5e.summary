@entity0 -- it feels like a generation gap in the @entity4			1
party elders appear increasingly concerned -- alarmed , even -- by an upstart effort by a new band of conservative lawmakers who want to shut down the federal government to protest the president 's signature health care law , @entity10			1
the plan -- really more of a bargaining strategy -- was hatched primarily by lawmakers elected in the past few years -- exposing a rift in the @entity4 about how best to deal with the controversial health care law a year before the 2014 elections			1
supporters of a government shutdown are nowhere near critical mass even as 13 lawmakers recently signed a letter pledging opposition to any spending bill that does n't defund the health law			1
to be successful , supporters of a government shutdown would need almost every @entity4 in the @entity27 to join their effort			1
@entity0 braces for post-recess shutdown battle the @entity4 establishment is undoubtedly against a shutdown and many of them are becoming more vocal about it			1
" the people of the nation would not be happy , " said 2012 @entity4 presidential nominee @entity35 this week at a @entity37 fundraiser about the possibility of a shutdown where @entity41 benefits were skipped and troops did n't get paid			1
@entity35 : pick someone who can win in 2016 " most @entity50 are really tired of those kinds of shenanigans here in @entity0 , " @entity47 sen. @entity46 said on the conservative @entity49 radio show last month			0
a prominent conservative opinion maker , columnist @entity54 , called the idea " nuts			0
" @entity58 sen. @entity57 , who in the past has showed himself more than willing to step on the cogs of government if he disagrees with something , told the @entity63 a shutdown could cost @entity4 control of the @entity66			1
his @entity58 colleague , rep. @entity67 , said on @entity68 that shutting down the government would be like a legislative " temper tantrum			2
" but there is evidence that many in the outspoken party base would seriously disagree			2
tea party activists posted a video critical of freshman @entity77 rep. @entity76 , who drew jeers when he said during a town hall event in his district this week , " no , " the party should n't shut the government down			1
@entity10 battle moves to states in an interview with @entity1 's @entity85 on wednesday , @entity76 defended his decision to stand against tea party activists who called for a shutdown to defund @entity10			1
but @entity76 appears to be an exception as a younger lawmaker standing against shutdown proponents			2
" the reality is , if we 're willing to take a government shutdown unless we repeal @entity10 , ... we will lose that vote and @entity10 will survive it , " @entity76 said			1
" why would we go about a strategy that is doomed to failure			0
" seeking to find middle ground in the party , a separate group of conservatives , including anti-tax activist @entity101 , have suggested instead to use the threat of shutdown to force a one year delay in implementing the law in place of pursuing a full repeal			1
ending @entity10 , avoiding shutdown juggling act for @entity111 backlash against @entity10 helped propel republicans to take back control of the @entity66 in 2010			0
but exhaustive efforts since to repeal it have been ineffective			0
@entity118 sen. @entity117 , the leader of the shutdown effort , was elected in 2010 after defeating longtime @entity120 sen. @entity120 in the primary			0
while his proposal to shut down the government is not embraced by establishment republicans , it has drawn praise from @entity128 sen. @entity127 and @entity130 sen. @entity129 , two conservative stars who are believed to be considering runs for president in 2016			1
both also , like @entity117 , defeated more establishment @entity4 candidates on their way to @entity0 in 2010			2
senate minority leader @entity137 , who has n't taken a definitive position on the shutdown plan , is now facing a primary challenge in his bid for reelection in @entity143			2
add to all of this the default , shutdown , economic calamity show that has been a @entity0 rerun due to a string of battles over the federal borrowing limit and government spending			2
these conservative newcomers to @entity0 have seen the @entity66 make dire warnings about how the recent forced spending cuts -- known formally as sequestration -- would have a negative effect on the government and military			0
but months later , the forced spending cuts have been largely swept out of the news and the federal government -- from the @entity161 to the @entity162 -- has shown an ability to absorb it for now			0
@entity127 recently argued in a speech at the @entity165 that shutting down the government would n't be that bad and could help the @entity4			1
" there are some @entity167 , some in the media and some @entity4 who portray a shutdown as a horrible calamity , " @entity127 said			1
" i think the term ' shutdown ' is a misnomer			0
it 's actually a partial , temporary shutdown			0
we have seen them before			0
" @entity127 argued that saturday and sunday are kind of like government shutdowns			0
read @entity181 review of @entity127 's claim but it is @entity35 , who has acknowledged that he 's probably the last person @entity4 are now looking to for advice , who gave the most earnest argument on tuesday against shutting down the government			1
" i badly want @entity10 to go away , and stripping it of funds has appeal			0
but we need to exercise great care about any talk of shutting down government , " said @entity35 , according to a prepared text of his remarks at the private fundraiser			0
" what would come next ... what would come next when soldiers are n't paid , when seniors fear for their @entity41 and @entity202 , and when the @entity203 is off duty ? i 'm afraid that in the final analysis , @entity10 would get its funding , our party would suffer in the next elections , and the people of the nation would not be happy			2
" a spokesman for @entity127 , responded to @entity35 on wednesday , arguing that @entity50 see @entity10 as " train wreck			0
" " they expect their elected representatives to fight to undo it , " said @entity127 spokesman @entity212			0
" if @entity4 stand up for principle , we can win this debate			2
