-- it 's the journey of thousands of miles that started with a single step			2
two @entity5 , whisked across continents to run a marathon sunday in @entity8 , @entity9			1
their trip funded via a crowdsourcing effort that started with a friend request and a popular book			2
a few weeks ago , @entity14 and @entity15 got a @entity17 message from @entity18			1
@entity18 , a @entity19 resident , had learned about the two men in the book " running with the @entity5 , " by @entity22			1
and he had a question for them			2
" i sent them a friend request and a note asking if they would be interested in racing in @entity9 -- if i could raise enough money to cover their airfare , " @entity18 says			1
@entity14 , 26 , was a little skeptical , but decided to take the risk			0
" we did n't really know what to make of it , but did n't want to miss a great opportunity either , " he says			0
and so began the process that took the two men nearly 10,000 miles from their tiny running town in western @entity5			1
the two are from the @entity41 area , where the most elite @entity5 marathon runners hail from			1
@entity18 , 35 , set up an online fund - raising campaign called @entity44			1
he urged donors to give $ 26 each -- a dollar for every mile the two would run in the @entity48			2
they could not afford to pay for the trip			0
running is a sport that does not come with a paycheck in @entity5			1
@entity14 works at his uncle 's gas station while @entity15 is a farmer			0
" these guys work so hard and are such hardworking and dedicated runners , " @entity18 says			2
" i wanted to bridge the divide between talent and opportunity			0
" he exceeded his goal for funds in a little over a month			0
armed with nearly $ 9,000 from the fund - raiser , he set out to make the trip happen			1
local celebrities after delayed visas and red tape that almost made them miss their flight , the pair arrived in @entity19 last week , and have become local celebrities			1
more strangers chipped in to ensure they stayed warm during the cold spell			0
when @entity18 picked them up at the airport , he thought they had forgotten their luggage			0
they had one backpack each with running shorts , shoes and minimal change of clothes			2
" they did n't have much in the way of warm clothing , " @entity18 says			0
" luckily , @entity85 heard about the guys and was concerned that they would be cold , " he says			0
" they very kindly opened up their flagship store and gave them lots of clothes to stay warm			0
" @entity92 , a local running supply store , gave them warm racing gear to wear during the marathon in @entity8			1
' like playing basketball with @entity98 ' the two have trained at @entity19 landmarks including the @entity101 , where residents waved			1
others joined in , running along with them			2
both will return to @entity5 on thursday			1
but they 'll never forget the kindness of strangers , they say			0
" the best part has been meeting the @entity9 , " @entity14 says			1
" everyone has been so friendly			0
our experience will inspire many people back in @entity5 , especially many of the younger runners			1
" @entity18 , who describes himself as a novice runner , works at the @entity114 and @entity115			0
though he spent many sleepless nights planning the logistics of the trip , he says it was all worth it			0
" i 'd do it all over again , " he says			0
" running with the @entity5 is like playing basketball with @entity98			1
these guys are masters of their trade			0
it has been very exciting and very humbling to watch			0
" @entity18 will run his first marathon with his new friends sunday			1
