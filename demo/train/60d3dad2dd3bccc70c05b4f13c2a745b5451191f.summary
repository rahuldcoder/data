@entity1 @entity3 helicopters struck @entity5 targets in @entity8 's @entity7 province over the weekend in an effort to push back @entity5 forces advancing near @entity11 , a senior @entity1 defense official said			1
the @entity12 did not specify the precise targets when it issued a news release sunday			1
four " strikes northeast of @entity11 struck two mortar teams , a large @entity5 unit and two small @entity5 units , " the release said , using another acronym for @entity5			1
fixed - wing aircraft also were part of the mission			0
but because @entity8 forces were close to @entity5 forces , the @entity25 were used because they fly low and can strike with precision , the official said			1
in @entity7 , about 30 miles ( 48 kilometers ) west of @entity31 , " @entity5 continues to make advances , " the official said			2
in @entity11 , " @entity8 security forces are struggling to retake territory			1
" the official described the area as " very much contested with @entity5 continuing to make gains			2
" the @entity25 ' low altitude poses a risk of a surface - to - air attack against the @entity1 helicopters			0
but with @entity5 forces in such a populated area , that precision was needed , the official said			2
so far , the @entity1 does n't see @entity5 making a direct run for @entity31 , but there is concern that @entity5 elements are in the city and around the airport , the official said			0
that has been the @entity1 assessment for some time			0
given @entity5 advances , the official said , there will be more attacks against @entity5 targets in @entity7 , as well as in other contested areas such as along the @entity61 border			1
there will probably be more strikes against mobile and fixed targets in the @entity68 area , the official said			0
the @entity1 is also still assessing whether it killed @entity70 , 33 , the leader of the @entity71 , in the first night of strikes in @entity73 , the official said			0
while he has not surfaced publicly or on social media , the @entity1 has still not seen sufficient corroborating intelligence , such as evidence of a funeral or martyrdom statements , to conclude that he is dead , the official said .			0

four " strikes northeast of @entity11 " struck a mortar team and @entity5 units , @entity12 says
@entity85 says copters were used because they **'re** precise and @entity8 forces were close
copters fly lower and are *slower* than *jet* *fighters* , so they **'re** more *vulnerable* to *ground* attacks
given @entity5 advances , the official said , there will be more attacks against @entity5 targets
