-- federal officials and residents across the country gave mixed reactions to @entity7 district judge @entity6 's preliminary injunction wednesday against part of the controversial @entity10 immigration law			1
the ruling at least temporarily blocks police from questioning people about their immigration status			1
here are some of the opinions : @entity10 gov. @entity17 @entity17 issued a statement wednesday afternoon saying she 's not ready to give up			1
" this fight is far from over , " she said			1
" in fact , it is just the beginning , and at the end of what is certain to be a long legal struggle , @entity10 will prevail in its right to protect our citizens			1
i am deeply grateful for the overwhelming support we have received from across our nation in our efforts to defend against the failures of the federal government			2
" i have consulted with my legal counsel about our next steps			1
we will take a close look at every single element judge @entity41 removed from the law , and we will soon file an expedited appeal at the @entity44 for the @entity45			2
" earlier in the day , @entity17 told reporters she thinks the ruling is a call to action for the federal government			1
" i think it is important that they , the federal government , got relief from the courts to not do their job			2
that means now they have got this temporary injunction , they need to step up and do the job that they have the responsibility to do for the people of @entity7 and the people of @entity10			1
" @entity64 " we believe the court ruled correctly when it prevented key provisions of @entity69 from taking effect , " the agency said in a written statement			1
" while we understand the frustration of @entity72 with the broken immigration system , a patchwork of state and local policies would seriously disrupt federal immigration enforcement and would ultimately be counterproductive			1
states can and do play a role in cooperating with the federal government in its enforcement of the immigration laws , but they must do so within our constitutional framework			0
" this administration takes its responsibility to secure our borders seriously and has dedicated unprecedented resources to that effort			0
we will continue to work toward smarter and more effective enforcement of our laws while pressing for a comprehensive approach that provides true security and strengthens accountability and responsibility in our immigration system at the national level			0
" @entity98 sheriff @entity97 and @entity100 sheriff @entity99 the two sheriffs whose @entity10 jurisdictions are near the @entity7 - @entity104 border issued a joint statement denouncing the court ruling			1
" incredibly , even though there is not one person who can legitimately claim to be harmed by a law that has not even taken effect , the result of an injunction is de facto amnesty through non-enforcement of laws against illegal immigration , " the sheriffs said			1
" the @entity118 and @entity64 are playing politics in demanding that law enforcement not act to protect the public but failing to do anything about our illegal crossing issue			1
it is putting our deputies and the families we 've sworn an oath to protect in harms way and we need the government to stop the lawsuits and start taking corrective action			0
help us , do n't sue us			0
" " the @entity133 administration has a light touch when it comes to securing the border but a heavy hand when it comes to sicking their lawyers on the people of @entity10			1
from @entity143 it might be hard to see the problems that we see every day as a result of our @entity147 cheese border			1
maybe if they spent some time in our counties they would think about a crackdown on illegal immigration rather than a crackdown on those of us fighting illegal immigration			0
" @entity118 " this is a major step that will help protect the residents of @entity10 against racial profiling and discrimination , and the @entity133 administration deserves praise for its principled decision to challenge this law despite pressure to stay silent , " said @entity156 , executive director of the @entity118			1
" a single state 's frustration with federal policy can not be allowed to hijack federal authority or dictate federal priorities in ways that impede effective law enforcement , threaten the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike and violate core @entity7 values			1
" @entity7 sens. @entity177 and @entity178 of @entity10 " we are deeply disappointed in the court 's ruling today and disagree with the court 's opinion that the @entity10 's law will unduly ' burden ' the enforcement of federal immigration law , " the @entity180 senators said in a joint statement			1
" instead of wasting taxpayer resources filing a lawsuit against @entity10 and complaining that the law would be burdensome , the @entity133 administration should have focused its efforts on working with @entity194 to provide the necessary resources to support the state in its efforts to act where the federal government has failed to take responsibility			1
" @entity200 @entity201 , president and ceo of the @entity204 advocacy group , supported the ruling			1
" not only did the judge side with the @entity204 community , she sided with the @entity211 , " @entity201 said in a written statement			0
" this is an unequivocal victory			0
the ruling enjoins the crux of the law that would have legitimized racial profiling			1
" @entity133 administration @entity219 deputy press secretary @entity218 said president @entity133 has not made plans to make a statement wednesday on the @entity10 immigration ruling			1
@entity223 the group said wednesday that states have filled a vacuum in immigration enforcement			0
the numbers of state bills addressing immigration has tripled since 2005 , according to @entity231 , program director for the center 's immigrant policy project			2
" this is an area where states have been involved for some time because the federal government has not , " @entity231 told @entity0			0
she expects the ruling to go the @entity7 @entity238			1
in the meantime , the conference will consider enforcement measures , guest worker programs and steps to put immigrants on the path to legal status			2
the group wants to be a partner with the federal government and is concerned about economic issues , @entity231 said			0
@entity251 @entity251 , a @entity204 civil rights group , said the @entity10 law would have placed an unfair burden on undocumented workers			0
" we were worried about this leading to racial profiling , " @entity251 communications director @entity255 told @entity0			0
" we 're very excited [ by the ruling ] , because this is what we 've been wanting			2
" in a written statement , @entity251 said it is also concerned about a lack of serious immigration reform			0
" @entity10 may be frustrated , as are we , with @entity194 ' failure to seriously address comprehensive immigration reform , " @entity251 said			0
" nevertheless , the solution is not a patchwork of varying state laws each trying to be more repressive than the next to force immigrants to go elsewhere			2
" @entity251 favors border control but wants the government to provide a " pathway to citizenship , " @entity270 said			2
one provision , the @entity276 , would allow undocumented students to apply for permanent residency			0
the @entity279 the @entity279 , which advocates immigration reduction , was disappointed but not surprised by the ruling , said executive director @entity282			2
" if the opponents had n't turned it into this bogey man it would have been a useful , if modest , tool for the police , " said @entity282			0
he told @entity0 the @entity10 law was n't intended to usurp federal authority			0
" @entity10 does not have its own immigration policy , even with the law			0
they are buttressing federal law , " @entity282 said			0
rep. @entity294 , @entity295 , member of the @entity296 and ranking member of the @entity298 " the federal government has a right and a responsibility to enforce existing laws , but when they fail to meet that responsibility , we should not stand in the way of the states that take action to respond to the very real threat of border violence , drug cartels and human smuggling , " @entity294 said			2
" the people who live under the constant threat of border violence have every right to be protected and have every right to defend themselves , their families and their communities			2
" i am certain that the @entity238 would agree that there is no legal recourse or precedent for stopping a state from operating within its rights by asserting its sovereignty in support of immigration laws that the federal government has failed to enforce			1
there 's nowhere in the @entity211 that says a state is limited to what it absolutely wo n't do and can be stopped for what it might do and to exercise a judgment against a state that has passed a law that is consistent with existing federal law is beyond absurd			2
" @entity339 " i think it 's a great victory for the @entity211 , " president @entity340 said of the decision			0
" i think all the provisions she has blocked from implementation were the most egregious			0
" tomorrow promises to be a much brighter day for @entity10 , " he said			0
although he expects the legal battle to continue , @entity347 said , all @entity72 will benefit from the ruling			1
he indicated that anyone planning to leave the state , including undocumented workers , may well change their plans			2
@entity354 @entity355 , the president of @entity354 , told @entity0 's @entity356 the ruling was " outrageous			2
" he said the judge basically is saying the federal government has the right not to enforce immigration laws			0
" we 're going through a constitutional and political crisis , " said @entity355 , whose group wants reform and an end to illegal immigration			0
he said @entity7 wo n't favor amnesty for undocumented workers because " the federal government ca n't enforce law			1
" " i promise you this debate is going to get hotter and hotter and hotter , " @entity355 said			0
@entity0 's @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 and @entity375 contributed to this report .			0
