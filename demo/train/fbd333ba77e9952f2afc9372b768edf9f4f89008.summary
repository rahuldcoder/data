@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 can be a fickle mistress in @entity5			1
home hero @entity6 was dejected and apologetic after a mistake in qualifying but @entity0 rang with fans chanting his name as he fought back to win the @entity12 @entity11			1
his victory was won at the expense of his @entity18 teammate and title rival @entity15 , who retired with a broken gearbox			1
the @entity20 had taken pole position and was leading at just over the halfway point before the pendulum of bad luck swung his way on lap 29			1
it was the first time @entity15 has retired this season while , in contrast , @entity6 had failed to cross the finish line twice			1

" you could say it was a real kick in the balls			1
i really had to pull up my socks and get on it			2
" i went away feeling terrible			2
i felt i really let the fans , the team and myself down			1
@entity43 " coming back today to turn that emptiness around was really my priority			2
this weekend showed you never give up			2
" @entity6 's second @entity12 gp victory -- earned exactly six years after his fantastic 2008 win in the wet -- was not only about personal redemption , it was also about closing the gap in the @entity5 world championship			1
luck has been on @entity15 's side at the previous three races , the 29 - year - old winning in @entity56 and @entity57 and finishing second in @entity58			1
@entity6 's home win means he is now just four points behind @entity15 , who was still smiling as he chatted to reporters in the @entity18 motor home after the race			1
the @entity18 duo will now renew their rivalries at the @entity20 @entity11 on 20 july -- and @entity18 chairman @entity66 , a three - time world champion himself , is predicting fireworks now @entity6 is back to his best			1
" @entity6 from the beginning of the season was on a very good stable level and @entity15 after @entity56 had everything going for him , " @entity66 said			1
" but now @entity6 is back on track so i tell you the next couple of races are going to be interesting			1
highly motivated " he is highly motivated and for me the most important thing is that this victory gives him a real push about his qualities , what he can achieve so there will be no ups - and - downs with him anymore			2
" everything is reset like before			2
so they will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion			2
" it 's interesting to watch now because they are exactly the same level			2
" @entity15 : @entity18 has not peaked yet there was also a turnaround in fortune for the @entity96 team , who saw their cars start out of position after failing to choose the right tires in a rain - hit qualifying			1
@entity102 hustled his way through the field with some impressive overtaking to finish a brilliant second in the car @entity108 had driven on friday for four laps before it ground to halt with an engine problem			1
" we 're on the right way , " said the @entity111 , who finished third last time out in @entity57			2
" one step more to go			0
" you see how quick the car is			0
it was a pleasure to drive			0
i was able to go through the field			0
i 'm really , really happy			0
" fine third @entity122 finished third for @entity123 , the same position his teammate @entity125 had started the race from			1
while the four - time world champion came in for fresh tires twice , @entity122 switched to a one - stop strategy , which moved him onto the podium			1
" i did n't intend on doing a one - stop but we were able to keep the pace , so we stayed on and just held on at the end , " the @entity131 explained			0
all three of us had a bit of redemption on our plate today			0
it was a pretty dismal saturday for us so we 're all pretty happy			0
this is definitely one of my best podiums this year			0
" a bit further down the road , @entity125 found himself engaged in a thrilling duel with @entity147 's @entity146			0
both drivers flexed their egos , complaining about each other 's driving style on the pit - to - car radios but in the end @entity125 swooped past @entity146 for fifth place			0
early incident the dramatic race had been delayed for an hour after a crash involving @entity158 's @entity147 on the opening lap. the @entity111 , who has had a difficult season since returning to the @entity162 team , lost control as he turned into the @entity164			0
as he rejoined the track at speed , the car kicked out into repeated spins			0
the @entity111 plunged into the barriers on the right and then collided with @entity171 's @entity96 -- the damage enough to end the @entity174 's 200th grand prix in miserable fashion			0
the @entity147 spokesman told the media : " @entity158 is ok			0
he obviously got a big hit			0
he only seems to be having some bruises to his ankle and a little bit on his knee			0
