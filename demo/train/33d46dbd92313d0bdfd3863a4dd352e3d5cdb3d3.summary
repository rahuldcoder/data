-- @entity1 loves its outlaws , but few of us actually dare to live the lifestyle			0
veteran life photographer @entity6 got about as close as anyone , riding along with a notorious biker gang			1
in 1965 , the @entity9 were little known outside the @entity10			2
@entity6 spent several weeks in @entity11 , photographing and traveling with the @entity13 chapter of a gang that would soon become notorious for its hedonistic , lawless swagger			2
see more of @entity6 's @entity9 photos at @entity17 the @entity9 are now a worldwide phenomenon -- incorporated , licensed and branded			1
but the gang @entity6 traveled with , two years before the @entity20 and four years before the deadly violence at a @entity23 concert at @entity24 made them infamous , truly lived on the fringes of society			0
in a culture where the @entity28 and the @entity29 fought a squeaky - clean battle for the hearts and minds of @entity1 , the @entity9 were , in the words of @entity34 , a " burst of dirty thunder " that shocked folks wherever they went			0
it was a time when the roar of stripped - down @entity40 and the sight of long - haired bikers on the freeway -- or riding into a sleepy town -- was still new , alien , and for the average law - abiding citizen , more than a little frightening			0
