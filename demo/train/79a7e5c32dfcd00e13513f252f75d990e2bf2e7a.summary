-- @entity1 is getting a lot of @entity4 buzz for her performance in " @entity6			1
" and while the young actress certainly deserves the attention for the mind - bending role , we 're a little concerned that a dud of a movie is about to hit theaters that could distract critics from her performance in the ballet thriller			0
her rom - com " @entity21 , " also starring @entity20 , is coming out right before the @entity22			1
sometimes when this kind of thing happens , it makes the stronger performance seem like a fluke and can cost an actor precious @entity22 votes			2
but @entity1 would not be the first star who went from stellar performance to getting stuck in a stinker			0
from " dreamgirls to " norbit " apparently , a lot of people felt that @entity37 's shot at winning an @entity4 for his role in " @entity39 " evaporated after his 2007 movie " @entity41			1
" for his role as @entity39 in " @entity39 , " @entity37 took home a @entity44 and a @entity45 and earned an @entity4 nomination ( but not a win ) , but when " @entity41 " dropped in theaters , the movie ended up winning eight @entity51 " @entity52 " awards			1
that 's a lot of bad " fruit			0
" the @entity0 : pics of 15 celebrity slobs @entity58 's sweetheart bombs @entity59 made history in 2010 for winning both an @entity4 and a @entity51 in the same year			1
actually , make that in the same weekend ! before accepting her best actress @entity4 for " @entity64 , " the gracious actress accepted a @entity51 for worst actress in " @entity66			1
" we 're sure her two statues sit side by side			0
from " @entity70 " to six stinkers @entity72 took home an @entity4 in 1997 for writing " @entity74 , " so i suppose his acting prowess was n't exactly on the line			0
but he followed up that win with a number of truly mediocre roles and was nominated for worst actor of the @entity52 this year for his contributions to film in " @entity83 , " " @entity84 , " " @entity85 , " " paycheck , " " @entity87 , " and " surviving @entity88			0
but it should be noted that @entity72 did accept his 2004 @entity51 in person , so at least he 's a good sport			2
the @entity0 : 12 celebs who 've denied getting breast implants " @entity94 " was a " monster " actress @entity96 followed her 2002 @entity97 in " @entity98 " with a @entity51 for worst actress in " @entity94 " in 2005			1
@entity100 accepted her @entity51 while holding her @entity22 , which is awesomely ... awesome			2
the @entity0 : 10 female stars who are ok with nudity he should have said " no " to " vice " @entity105 had a great year in 2004 after winning an @entity4 for " @entity106 , " getting another nomination for " @entity108 , " and having a hit song with " @entity110			2
" but he followed that strong year with films like " @entity104 " and " @entity112 , " which , no matter what anyone says , was super mediocre			0
she had a good and a bad " marriage " movie her performance in 2008 's " @entity126 " earned @entity120 an @entity4 nomination , but her other bridal - themed flop , " @entity123 , " the following year made us forget all about it			1
wedding - themed movies are just a hard genre to get right			0
the @entity0 : 10 @entity130 female celebs under 35 who are " out " from piano man to sci - fi flop nothing could make me stop loving @entity135 , but he did manage to disappoint critics when he followed up his 2003 @entity4 for " @entity137 " with " @entity138 " and ( shudder ) " @entity139			2
" and now he 's wasting his talent in weird sc - fi movies like " @entity142 " and " @entity143 ? " get this man a period piece , pronto ! the @entity0 : 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 @entity148 all rights reserved			0

@entity1 's rom - com " @entity21 " is coming out right before the @entity22
@entity59 made history in 2010 for winning both an @entity4 and a @entity51
@entity96 followed her 2002 @entity22 with a @entity51 in 2005
