-- board a bus or a train today and chances are you 'll see several people with ereaders in hand			0
while most probably bought their electronic books on a popular website , you may find a few who borrowed the paperless books from the library			1
ebooks accounted for 6.4 % of all publishing in 2010 , according to the @entity17 , and 114 million electronic books were sold last year			1
while the majority of ebooks sold today are bought by individual readers , a growing number of the paperless books are winding up in public library catalogs			1
" our popular e-content collection at @entity29 currently has over 75,000 copies across more than 35,000 titles , " said @entity24 , director of collections and circulation operations at the @entity27			0
he oversees the intake of more than a million new items every year			0
while that sounds like a lot of ebooks , it 's a tiny fraction of the system 's overall number of books available for lending			1
" we have over 6 million items across our 90 locations in the physical circulation collections , " @entity24 said			1
ebook lending is growing at a fast pace at the @entity48			1
the number of downloads of electronic books on the library 's website grew by 81 % in the last 12 months , @entity24 said			1
the more than 9,000 public library systems across the country are experiencing a similar growth in @entity58 demand			1
so why would someone pay for an ebook if they can download it free from a library 's website ? after all , the process is more or less identical to buying an electronic book on @entity66 or @entity67 and @entity69 's website			1
that has publishers approaching @entity58 lending with some trepidation			1
several large publishing companies have yet to make ebooks available to public libraries			1
those that have sold ebooks to libraries set limitations on how they can be loaned out			0
for example , one electronic copy of a book can be taken out by just one reader at a time			0
some companies limit the number of copies of a book they 'll sell to a library			2
a few have set a limit on how many times a book can be downloaded			0
@entity24 said publishers should n't be concerned that @entity58 lending will affect commercial sales of ebooks			1
" digitally , there 's kind of a fear right now , " @entity24 said			2
several publishing companies were contacted for this story but none returned messages seeking comment			0
" the impact is profound both on the publishers and the libraries , " said author @entity104			1
he has written 30 books , including " @entity109 " and " @entity110			2
" both were made into popular movies			0
@entity104 said he believes as more publishers make @entity58 available to libraries , the companies will limit the number of times most books can be loaned out			1
" they have a product that has to get out there even to libraries			0
i do n't think they 'll remain reluctant			2
" they 're going to have to figure out ways to stay profitable and this is going to be a challenge			0
" consider that public libraries make up 10 % of all book sales in the @entity130 each year			1
while publishers are concerned about the institutions competing in the @entity58 market with a free product , libraries are also an integral part of the publishing industry 's bottom line			1
" we do not want to see any publisher go out of business , because they create the content , " @entity24 said			0
" it 's very much that we 're on the same side of the fence here			2
we just have to be able to work together			0
" as with physical books , there can be a wait involved in downloading an electronic book from a library 's website			1
publishing companies call that wait " friction " and it 's why they 're comfortable with libraries lending physical books for free			1
but publishers think there 's less friction involved in borrowing an @entity58 from a library 's homepage			1
the concern is that this could affect commercial sales			2
librarians think making ebooks available for lending has value for the publishing industry			2
@entity24 said it exposes readers to books in a way that legitimizes the material			2
that material can reach a much wider audience			0
libraries across the country recently developed the ability to make their ebook downloads compatible with the @entity181 , @entity66 's @entity182			2
@entity66 representatives did not respond to a request for an interview			0
@entity66 sells more ebooks in the @entity130 than any other company			0
some patrons noted that a library is more than just a place where people go to take out books			1
they often serve as civic meeting centers			0
they offer an opportunity for social interaction that you do n't get with ebooks			2
" i love the libraries , " said @entity199 outside the @entity200 on @entity201 and @entity202 40th street in @entity203			0
since i was a kid they were very entertaining and they 're resourceful			0
as i became older they became more important to me in terms of identifying information and accessing information " @entity199 has never read an ebook			0
" the written word is a wonderful thing and that 's something you should always have in your hand ... turning those pages , there 's an experience that comes with that			2
" @entity222 walked out of the same library branch with a bag full of books			1
she worries that libraries will lose their place in society as borrowing ebooks grows in popularity			0
" i think it will be sad			0
i mean there 's just something about smelling the books and the whole experience , " @entity222 said			1
" it 's like a feeling of calm and peace and you do n't really get that anymore			1
you ca n't just sit and read a book			2
" @entity24 is n't concerned about the potential for libraries to lose their role as a gathering place			1
he said they 'll continue to offer enriching programming that draws people to the buildings with the closing of @entity253 bookstores there are just about as many public library branches in the @entity130 as there are commercial bookstores ; more than 16,000			1
it may not be surprising , then , that while more people are borrowing ebooks from libraries , more people are also going to libraries			0
" our usage is going up as well , " said @entity24 as he pointed out that @entity200 libraries loaned more than 28 million items in 2010			0
" that 's a lot of people coming through our doors			2
" but the number of digital patrons is growing at a much faster pace			0
" we have , i think , over 150,000 @entity274 followers on our flagship @entity274 account and over 40,000 @entity278 friends , " @entity24 said			0
he hopes that more publishing companies will see the benefit in making ebooks available to public libraries with mutually beneficial arrangements			0
one possibility would be the creation of subscription packages segmented into specific genres or themes such as best - sellers , classic novels and children 's books , each with their own price			1
the challenge for publishing companies is figuring out how to capitalize on the millions of people across @entity130 who patronize libraries without having too much of the product being given away .			0
