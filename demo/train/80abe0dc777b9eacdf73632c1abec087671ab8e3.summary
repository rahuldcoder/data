to look at , these tiny bugs are relatively unassuming , perhaps even slightly creepy to the insect - adverse			1
to @entity5 , however , they are the solution to many of the ills facing the developing world			1
the humble palm weevil could potentially eradicate world hunger and malnutrition , it could lift whole communities out of poverty , and bring down global @entity17 levels			1
for a creature measuring just a few inches in length , that 's a lot of power			2
" if anything , our business model is too disruptive , " says @entity5 , who launched @entity24 with four fellow @entity26 students from @entity27			2
their aim is to introduce insect farming to countries with an affinity for insect consumption and a lack of access to nutritional sustenance			1
their idea won them the 2013 @entity42 , which provides $ 1m seed money for the most game - changing social enterprise , as well backing from the @entity48 government - funded @entity46			1
with their winnings , @entity24 set up a pilot program in @entity51 , where food insecurity remains an issue in various parts of the country			1
currently , 75 % of pre-school - aged children and two - thirds of pregnant women in @entity51 suffer from anemia , according to the @entity61			1
" in the rural community , the food is mainly made up of carbohydrates			1
because of the fact that you 're not getting the protein you need -- there is n't much fish or beef in the diet -- i think what they eat is lacking in nutrition , " says dr. @entity72 , an entomologist and research fellow at the @entity75 and @entity74 at the @entity76			1
" the palm weevil can be a good supplement , " he adds			2
in 2013 , the @entity82 released a report advocating insect consumption worldwide			1
the report found that pound - for - pound , palm weevils -- like other insects -- have similar levels of protein as beef , but beats out the bovine in levels of iron , potassium , zinc , phosphorous and several amino acids			1
while the government supplies pregnant women with iron pills and vitamins , @entity5 says locals are n't always too amenable to taking them			2
" in areas where iron deficiencies seems to be the greatest , there is also a lack of education , or sometimes a lack of trust in government			0
if you go to a small village outside of @entity114 , good luck instructing a woman to take a package of pills and expect an order of compliance , " he notes			0
" we 're introducing iron and protein in a way that is much more culturally acceptable			0
" moreover , some @entity125 , particularly those living in the north and east , already make palm weevils a part of their diet			0
" you wo n't see it everywhere in @entity51 , but in places where it is consumed , it is consumed with quite a high affinity , " says @entity5			1
while he notes that @entity51 has " a strong demand , " he says what it lacks is supply , as currently the bugs are harvested by hand			1
by introducing farming , @entity24 is not only increasing access to a cheaper and more nutritional source of protein , it says it is introducing new revenue streams for ghanians living in poverty			0
" the process of farming itself is n't overly complicated			0
someone who is uneducated but industrious can do it and get it up and running in a short amount of time , " says @entity5			0
@entity24 has decided to target farmers living in rural and peri-urban communities , where , @entity5 notes , there is an abundance of land , but a dearth of opportunities			1
@entity24 would provide farmers with the kits and training free of charge , then buy back the weevils to distribute en masse throughout the country			0
@entity24 is also looking into creating products from the weevils , such as a high - protein flour that could be added to any dish to make it more nutritious			0
" i think it has a lot of potential , " says @entity72			0
" previously , the wood from the palm trees was n't really used for anything			0
people would make wine from it maybe , then leave it			2
now they can use it to raise the weevil , and get some small income			0
it could have a great economic impact , " he adds			0
@entity24 has other insect - farming projects it 's either launched or is looking into			2
the group has also set up a pilot grasshopper - farming program in @entity195 , and is looking into introducing cricket farming in @entity197			1
the choice of insect is determined by local tastes			2
it is also looking at introducing entomophagy -- or the practice of bug - eating -- into the @entity205			0
while the project in @entity51 is fairly new ( @entity24 launched the program less than three months ago ) , @entity5 has high hopes for it , ultimately envisioning his weevil products to reach 30 % of the market in @entity51			1
" you 're asking an optimist , " he concedes			0
" i really see us having great impact			0
by next year 's end , it would be possible to reach anywhere from 500,000 to one million people			2

two billion people eat insects in *162* countries around the world
insects need less food , water and land to rear than beef and *chicken*
social enterprise aspire is trying to increase insect consumption globally
it thinks its @entity51 pilot program will *revitalize* the economy
