@entity0 -- on july 1 , 2013 the 27 - nation @entity2 will become 28			1
with a low credit rating of junk and a political class stained by accusations of endemic corruption , the @entity4 state of @entity5 is soon to become the @entity2 's latest addition			1
@entity12 is embracing recession - marred @entity5 , three years into a debt crisis that is plaguing countries across southern @entity16			2
leading economies such as @entity18 and @entity19 are struggling to cope with high borrowing costs and many @entity2 nations are suffering from chronic unemployment			2
but for @entity5 , joining @entity16 's elite club will mark the end a 10 - year campaign to enter the region 's single market			2
as one of the @entity4 countries to emerge from the ruins of @entity31 in the 1990s , @entity5 will be only the second country to join the @entity2 after @entity32 in 2004			1
@entity33 , a senior research fellow in @entity35 politics at the @entity36 , says to some extent @entity5 " got lucky " and its imminent membership is down to having " friends in the right places			2
" he told @entity1 : " there 's always been this sense that @entity5 has had a strong champion in @entity44 and @entity45			2
they have always taken a very strong position on @entity5 membership			0

he added : " it 's mission accomplished ... the time for conditionality has gone			0
" economy one of the challenges facing @entity5 is its growth prospects			0

a high budget deficit , rising national debt and a lack of competitiveness has resulted in stagnating growth			0
@entity100 , a senior research fellow in the political economy of @entity16 at the @entity36 , told @entity1 : " the @entity2 will not be a panacea for @entity5 's economy			1
" @entity100 says that at the turn of the century , @entity5 's banking industry became largely foreign - owned by @entity35 banks			1
despite not being in the single currency , many small businesses in @entity5 have debts denominated in euros rather than in kuna - the country 's domestic currency - exposing them to exchange rate risk			1
@entity100 added : " it 's very similar to @entity77 because it 's a highly euro - ized economy ... unlike @entity77 they do n't have access to any of the eurozone bailout funds			0
they 're very much on their own			0
" read more : @entity77 : when anger goes beyond despair in december , @entity121 's - one of the three big credit rating agencies - downgraded @entity5 to the lowest investment status known as " junk			2

political corruption @entity5 is also in the midst of cleaning up a political class that is rife with corruption			0
since the country 's inception in the early 1990s , it has struggled to choke off profiteering from those in positions of power			2
@entity140 - an organization tackling corruption -- ranked @entity5 below @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 in its @entity144 for 2012			2
but the country still came in above @entity19 - @entity16 's third largest economy			0
@entity147 , head of @entity148 in @entity5 said : " the country 's evolution has been very slow since 1990			1
" but the current government - led by @entity152 - is taking steps to clean up the country 's act under close supervision from the @entity2			1
in november last year , the country 's former prime minister , @entity157 , was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of taking pay - offs from foreign companies			1
@entity157 - who was premier from 2004 to 2009 - had fled the country but was arrested in @entity45			0
@entity162 , deputy chairman of the policy institute , @entity163 , says @entity5 's progress to the " doorstep of the @entity2 " is quite remarkable			1
he told @entity1 : " we must n't forget how bad it [ @entity5 ] was in the 1990s			0
the darkest moments of war , occupation , mass killings , ethnic cleansing , and autocratic leadership and crony capitalism were all there			0
" @entity162 recalls a conversation he had two years ago with @entity175 , now @entity5 's foreign minister			0
she told him that " no one dares to engage in corruption because everyone is so scared now ... no one is immune			0
