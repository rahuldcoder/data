-- it seems the 2012 election cycle learned tricks employed by criminals and dictators			2
@entity6 reported last summer that an anonymous shell company made a $ 1 million donation to restore our future , a @entity11			2
the company , which was incorporated this year in @entity13 -- a state known for peddling corporate secrecy -- then quickly dissolved , leaving no trace of the person who controlled it			2
the negative publicity surrounding this news report led the anonymous donor to identify himself and the @entity23 to confirm it			0
but there is no reason to believe that this is the first or the last instance of campaign finance hiding behind the opacity of anonymous @entity31 shell companies			1
even more troubling , this example demonstrates just how easy it is to exploit @entity31 laws and use anonymous companies to funnel money through the financial system			1
individuals can legally disguise their identities and assets behind anonymous shell companies			1
information about the beneficial , or ultimate , owner of a company is not required to be collected when a company forms			0
this enables people , including those on financial sanctions lists , to hide behind anonymous corporate vehicles and deposit illicit funds into @entity31 banks			0
@entity54 has worked hard to tighten laws to combat money laundering and tax evasion , but incorporation laws continue to allow the formation and operation of anonymous shell companies that fly under the radar , making it nearly impossible for law enforcement to do its job			1
the same loophole that allowed a donor to hide behind an anonymous shell company provides terrorists , corrupt foreign politicians and drug traffickers opportunity to squirrel dirty money into and through the @entity31 financial system			1
@entity73 regimes such as @entity74 have benefited from secrecy provided by @entity31 shell companies			1
a lengthy and expensive investigation by the @entity78 uncovered a complex nesting of shell companies that allowed @entity74 to profit from @entity82 's pricey real estate market			1
@entity85 , on trial in @entity82 on terrorism charges , is also accused of setting up a global network of shell companies to disguise illicit activities			1
the @entity90 movie " @entity91 " is loosely based on this @entity93 arms dealer , who authorities say provided weapons used to fuel conflicts throughout @entity96 , @entity97 and the @entity98			0
after he was extradited to the @entity31 last year , attorney general @entity105 said , " long considered one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , @entity85 will appear in federal court in @entity107 to answer charges of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to a terrorist organization for use in trying to kill @entity31			0
to date , 12 @entity31 shell companies linked to @entity85 ( @entity112 ) have been identified -- incorporated in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity13			1
corrupt foreign politicians also take advantage of anonymous @entity31 front companies to hide money they have stolen from their own countries			2
in @entity121 , the @entity120 regime stashed millions of dollars in @entity31 banks while poverty in the country worsened			0
the president 's son , despite a monthly salary of less than $ 7,000 , used wire transfers and @entity31 shell companies to funnel more than $ 100 million through @entity31 banks -- funds that allowed him to purchase ( @entity112 ) a $ 35 million mansion in @entity133 and a $ 33 million private jet			1
there is a simple solution that would prevent these crimes			0
if states collected information about the real people who own or control a company when it is formed , it would be much harder for criminals to hide their identities in order to launder illicit funds into the financial system			1
in august , sens. @entity148 , @entity149 , and @entity150 , @entity151 , introduced a bill that would close this loophole			0
the @entity154 and @entity155 ( @entity112 ) would require states to maintain a registry of the beneficial owners of each corporation and @entity160 formed according to its laws			2
this is an easy change			0
states would need only to add a question inquiring about the ultimate owner of the company to incorporation forms they already use			0
multiple law enforcement agencies have endorsed the bill , which would give them access to this information			0
setting a standard for collecting information about the true owner of a company would level the playing field between the states while preventing terrorists , drug traffickers and kleptocrats from hiding behind corporate secrecy			0
it would also strengthen our homeland security , make it harder for corrupt politicians to steal money that should be used to eliminate poverty and reduce the ability of @entity31 and foreigners alike to anonymously donate large sums of money to political campaigns			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : owners of shell companies can donate to politicans anonymously
@entity198 : @entity205 companies allow people to disguise names , assets to launder money
@entity205 companies provide secrecy to *pariah* regimes , criminals , *gun* *runners* , she says
a *proposed* law would require ultimate owners to name themselves , @entity198 writes
