@entity0 -- the dispute surrounding a student vacation flight from @entity0 to @entity4 is getting uglier			1
one hundred one students and eight chaperones were kicked off an early morning @entity8 flight before its scheduled departure monday			1
the controversy now pits the airline against an @entity13 high school			0
" we take this matter seriously and have started our own investigation , " said a statement released tuesday by rabbi @entity15 , executive director of the @entity17 school			1
" preliminarily , it does not appear that the action taken by the flight crew was justified			2
" from the airline 's perspective , it sounds like a large - scale version of the parental " do n't - make - me - turn - this - car - around " scenario			1
@entity30 , which owns @entity8 , said the group of " non-compliant passengers " would not stay seated , and some were using their mobile devices after being asked not to			1
when the students failed to comply with requests from the flight crew , including the captain , they were asked to leave the plane , delaying the @entity8 flight for 45 minutes , said @entity30 spokesman @entity41			1
@entity30 acquired @entity8 in a deal announced three years ago			1
students and chaperones from the @entity46 - based school said the flight crew overreacted to the teenagers who were looking forward to visiting @entity48 and rafting , among other activities			1
" it blew out of proportion			0
it was a mountain out of a molehill , " said teacher @entity53 , one of the chaperones			2
according to @entity53 , some students may have had to be told twice to sit down or turn off their phones , but everyone listened			2
" they certainly did not do what the stewardess was claiming they did , " she said			0
" that 's what was so bizarre			2
" travelers take aim at kids on a plane @entity53 said the flight attendants were " nasty , " " overreacting " and " created an incident when there did n't have to be one			1
" according to @entity30 , the group violated safety regulations			1
@entity53 said she would understand if individual students who were not complying had been asked to leave , but she objected to the collective punishment			2
@entity53 said a " small group " of students in the back of the aircraft were chatty , but that did not warrant the flight crew to force an entire group of 109 people off the plane			1
" it was so ugly , " she said			0
rabbi @entity86 , another chaperone , said none of the students on the plane was particularly loud or disruptive			2
and when he saw that the flight attendant was flustered and had asked students to leave , he asked which kids were causing issues and offered to help , but she refused			1
" they just simply said ' get off the plane , ' " @entity86 said			0
@entity86 's @entity98 account included a joking photo of the class labeled " whitewater rafting in @entity102 ! ! " it 's not clear when it was taken , but some of the students did have a layover in @entity102 after they were put on other flights			1
student @entity109 said he felt they were targeted because they are an identifiably @entity112 group			1
" they treated us like we were terrorists ; i 've never seen anything like it			0
i 'm not someone to make these kinds of statements , " @entity109 said			0
" i think if it was a group of non-religious kids , the air stewardess would n't have dared to kick them off			1
" @entity109 said @entity30 is attempting to cover up an unprofessional and rash decision by saying their group was not cooperating with the crew , when in fact they were , he said			1
kid - free ' @entity130 ' launched on airline " it was 4 o'clock in the morning			0
the last thing any of us wanted to do was get up and make a mess , " @entity109 said			0
but business passenger @entity136 , who takes the commuter flight three times a month , said he saw " definitely less than eight " chaperones with the students			1
he saw only two adults walk off the plane with the kids			0
and the chaperones sat in the front of the plane , while the noisy students sat in the back			1
@entity136 sat in business class , he said			0
he said about 10 of the more than 100 students did n't listen to the flight crew 's instructions and were noisy , swapping seats to sit beside friends and using their cell phones			1
" they were laughing at them and ignoring them , " @entity136 said of the 10 students			2
the crew gave the students " multiple chances " to heed preflight instructions			2
" the pilot warned them			0
they thought it was a joke			1
you know , it was n't a joke , " @entity136 said			1
" i 've never seen this , " he added			0
" it 's a commuter flight			1
there 's no families on it			2
" @entity136 did n't witness any anti-semitic events			2
" absolutely not , " he said			0
" there was not one ethnic slur from anyone on the flight crew or anyone who was inconvenienced for two hours			2
" if they were adults , they would n't have even had that many chances			2
that 's the bottom line , " @entity136 said			2
how to behave on an airplane one chaperone pleaded with the pilot and security for another chance			0
" one chaperone â € ” not two , not eight â € ” one talked to them asking for a second chance			0
the pilot said , ' you had a second chance , you had a third chance			0
there 's other people ; we have to go			2
it 's not stopping , ' " @entity136 said			0
another student in the group , @entity204 , said he was one of the first to be kicked off the plane			1
he said a flight attendant did not give him a chance to turn off his cell phone before asking him to " get off the plane			0
" the same flight attendant then told the captain that the students were " making trouble " and not turning off their phones , he added			1
the captain did n't come out of the cockpit until the last second when he asked the group to leave , @entity204 said			1
according to @entity204 , he and his classmates were quiet and were sitting down as they were told			0
and when they were asked to leave , they left in a respectful and orderly fashion			0
" we were more behaved than kids should be , " he said			0
both @entity86 and @entity204 said the airline 's customer service did its best to accommodate the group by getting them on the next available flights			1
but the group had to be split up and they were in transit for a total of 12 hours , @entity204 said			0
