you can pretend you 're totally someone else at any bar after enough drinks			1
but to pretend you 're totally somewhere else ? that requires a more inspired atmosphere			0
with , say , exotic opium den decor and a last - call gong			0
or vintage 1970s home furnishings and a dude in a mustache serving loaded sno - cones out of an old @entity13 in the back			0
or a fake log cabin featuring flaming toasted marshmallow cocktails and a friendly reminder at the entrance that " only you can prevent forest fires			2
" naturally , all of these drinking scenes are available in @entity23 -- home to some of the most treasured theme bars anywhere			1
with so many of them , where do we start ? how about with some favorite haunts , where alcohol would n't be caught dead without a chaser of intoxicating kitsch			1
the @entity34 theme : cabin in the woods neighborhood : @entity39 signature drink : @entity41 ( 1921 @entity42 , rum , honey , fernet , toasty marshmallows ) the great outdoors concept runs sufficiently wild at this treasured bar full of stuffed rodents and a local crowd of @entity50 drinking ' round the fire like they 're actually coming in from the cold			1
@entity53 stands guard at the front entrance			1
a @entity57 statue looms by the bar , along with an animatronic squirrel with an ax			2
wait staff hustle around in flannel serving drinks called @entity64 and @entity65			2
are you in the @entity67 or just some tame bedroom community wedged between @entity23 and the @entity69 ? after enough $ 5 @entity71 at happy hour ( 5 - 9 p.m. ) this may actually turn into a debate			1
the @entity34 , 3172 @entity74 , @entity23 ; + 323 662 9227 @entity75 at @entity76 's theme : ' 70s neighborhood : @entity79 signature drink : " @entity88 " ( @entity83 - infused @entity82 mezcal , @entity84 , @entity85 , coffee , cream ) in hipster @entity79 , theme bars come and go about as fast as the latest cocktail craze			1
one of the latest hit drinking scenes looks like it 's been here since @entity95 threw that crazy , naughty house party when @entity97 and @entity98 were away for the weekend			2
while that may be an episode we all sadly missed , fans of the grooviest bygone decade can play it out themselves in this fake ' 70s - style house and patio -- cleverly hiding behind a fridge door in the back of a faux garage			2
inside it 's a swirl of green couches , homey lamps , family photos and hockey trophies on the mantle			2
djs spin @entity115 and old @entity116 atop a wood - encased tv set			1
bartenders pour @entity119 on tap			0
out back , crowds veg in hammocks and gather ' round a converted @entity13 trailer where sno - cone cocktails are served by a guy sporting a pre- " @entity127 " moustache			0
@entity128 never seem to come home here			0
@entity75 at @entity76 's , 1611 n. @entity130 , @entity23 ; + 323 962 3804 @entity131 theme : polynesian neighborhood : @entity135 signature drink : @entity137 ( @entity139 liqueurs , passion fruit , dark corub rum , " secret " flavors ) never judge a bar by its size			1
the yardstick of @entity23 tiki bars , @entity131 ( which can barely fit a yardstick inside of it ) has been confirming this wise adage since 1961 when patrons began squeezing into this family - run , overly adorned , shack - like landmark on outer @entity154 -- home to some of the strongest fruity cocktails between here and @entity159			1
crammed with an ever - accruing inventory of tiki masks and other @entity168 @entity167 ( regulars keep bringing in stuff for the walls ) , the bar 's dozen stools and handful of tables draw a mishmash of east side hipsters and @entity174 types			1
and a line on weekends			0
nearly 100 tropical libations are on the drink menu , which includes an @entity178 ( but no wine or beer ) and a cocktail wheel for indecisive types to spin			0
other crowd pleasers include a smoke - like - it 's - the - ' 70s policy inside and enough atmosphere to fill a hundred @entity186 's			1
@entity131 , 4427 @entity154 , @entity79 ; +1 323 669 9381 @entity187 theme : urban cowboy neighborhood : @entity79 signature drink : ranch @entity192 ( vodka , gin , rum , tequila , sweet and sour , @entity197 ) a big ol ' wooden lair done up with hay bales , aged farming equipment , driftwood signs reading " @entity203 will be shot " and mannequins in racy @entity206 regalia peaking out of second story windows , this steak and taters place with about 100 @entity210 serves massive enough drinks and ambiance to qualify as an honorary theme bar			1
even on the flashy @entity214 , @entity187 stands out a mite			0
it 's a knee - slappingly welcome relief from the usual velvet - rope attitude doled out on this street			2
cocktails are served in 1 ½ - liter carafes			0
out on the patio , there are campfire pits for do - it - yourself s'more roasting			0
and , yes , there 's a mechanical bull			2
it 's the only one ( we know of ) in @entity23 -- aside from the three you 'll find in a larger @entity187 location just over the hill at @entity232			1
@entity187 , 8371 @entity154 , @entity79 ; +1 323 656 2007 @entity233 theme : @entity236 cantina neighborhood : @entity238 signature drink : @entity240 ( @entity242 tequila , agave nectar , watermelon juice , lime juice , cucumbers , mint ) are fiery walls aglow with @entity236 wrestling posters , ' round - the - calendar @entity249 lights and a bull 's head enough to transport you from the actual location of this compact drinking hive ( seven blocks from the @entity257 ) into @entity259 land ? por que no ? especially when factoring in the bar 's huge selection of tequilas ( more than 400 at last count ) and tasty antojitos menu			1
on any given weekend night the place is filled with a mezcal - conversant crowd still young enough to count thursdays as the weekend			0
@entity233 , 8138 w. 3rd st. , @entity23 : +1 323 852 1551 @entity269 theme : @entity271 neighborhood : @entity74 signature drink : @entity274 ( vodka , white rum , pineapple juice , coconut cream , @entity197 ) it should come as no surprise in @entity23 that the city 's most alluringly overdone @entity282 lounge has been hiding for years on a drab corner of outer @entity285 across from an @entity287 and next door to a vacuum and janitorial supplies store			1
do n't be put off by the misleading exteriors			0
it 's what 's inside that counts			2
namely , every opium den decor cliche on the list			0
cozy rooms with walls as red as @entity303 's @entity302			0
and do n't forget the last - call gong			0
all very authentic feeling after enough @entity306			0
@entity269 , 1514 @entity307 , @entity23 ; +1 323 666 3524 @entity308 writes regularly for @entity1 and the @entity309			1
a @entity311 recipient from the @entity312 , his work on travel and the outdoors has spanned six continents and appeared in over 50 publications			0
he lives in @entity23 .			1

at these @entity23 haunts , the drinks come with a chaser of kitsch
@entity53 guards the entrance of the @entity34
like @entity326 and @entity116 ? it 's all ' 70s at @entity75 at @entity76 's
of course @entity23 has a superb tiki bar
