-- if you do n't like mangoes , look away now			1
this article includes a " mango " word count well in excess of what is normally reasonable			1
it features mango culinary demonstrations , mango samplings , mango lectures , mango medics , a mango auction and even a mango summit			2
that 's because i attended the @entity17 , held in the @entity18 in @entity19 earlier this month			1
it 's an annual event , one that draws enthusiasts , like myself , and also mango " experts " who gather to talk , taste and slurp their way around this sweetest , drippiest of fruits			1
i imagine most are still reading			0
after all , who does n't like mangoes ? the @entity30 is the world 's biggest importer of mangoes , buying in more than 300,000 tons of them in 2010 , worth around $ 280 million , according to the @entity37 's @entity36 figures			1
that 's not as much bananas -- in the same year the @entity30 imported more than 4 million tons of bananas , worth nearly $ 2 billion			1
but clearly we have a liking for this red - yellow fruit			2
my mission , i decided , was to try and discover if there is such a thing as a " perfect " mango , and if so , where i could find it			2
hundreds of varieties it 's not as absurd a mission as you might think -- there are an estimated one thousand mango varieties grown around the world , the @entity51 has a collection of 600 types , and they 're all quite different			1
" surprisingly , only 20 of those are commercially traded , " says @entity59 , the curator of tropical fruit for @entity62 's @entity61			1
" the most common are @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
with the exception of @entity65 , which is from @entity70 , all other varieties are from @entity71			2
" mangoes were introduced to the @entity30 in the early 1900s by @entity73 , the then manager of the @entity74 of the @entity30 @entity75			1
his global seed explorations brought thousands of seeds , plants and crops into the country , including the mango			2
originally from @entity83 , the mango moved to @entity84 , then @entity86 and the @entity85			2
@entity73 brought the mango into the @entity30 from @entity88			1
for dr. @entity90 , director of horticulture and senior curator of tropical fruit at the @entity62 , mangoes are " a special fruit that have everything : aromas , flavors , colors and culture			1
" they bring out passion and appeal to the common man and to the most sophisticated			0
" so where should i start on my perfect mango mission ? " mangoes from @entity107 do not taste the same as mangoes from @entity88 , @entity110 or @entity70			1
it 's just geography , " says dr. @entity90			0
so perhaps i should start close by -- in @entity71			0
@entity71 produces the majority of mangoes in the @entity30 , and it turns out @entity115 are exceptionally confident with their mango selections			1
local favorites standing in front of the one dollar line for the mango tasting and flavor evaluations , i ask festival attendee @entity122 what she votes for			2
her mango of choice is the @entity127 , a complex mango from @entity71 with layers of flavors			2
@entity132 's second choice goes to the @entity65 , also known as the @entity65 , from @entity70 , with thick , buttery flesh and a thin pit			0
for @entity132 , mangoes are great in all forms : hot , cold , as smoothies or in a cooked dish			1
for others , including myself , the choice is too overwhelming to make such an important decision so quickly			0
i wonder if there are tricks or techniques i should apply to come to a decision quicker			0
" the best way to taste mango and to appreciate the complexity of the flavors is early in the morning with an empty stomach , " says @entity59			1
if you want to get really technical , which is exactly what festivals like this seem to thrive on , we can also argue over mango cultivation , pruning , crafting and market demand			2
the event features a long diary of workshops and displays and other proceedings on all things mango			1
i learn , for instance , that while @entity88 is the world 's biggest producer of mangoes by some distance , @entity70 is the biggest supplier to the @entity30 , with @entity172 , @entity88 and @entity173 following			1
that does n't necessarily mean @entity70 has the best mangoes , but the @entity177 variety from @entity70 is deliciously sweet with an appetizing orange color			2
then there 's the @entity67 -- shining yellow and aromatic			0
there 's the @entity183 from @entity184 -- strong and sour			0
the @entity185 from @entity186 is also pleasant , while the @entity66 variety is rather grassy			0
mangoes during the festival sell for the modest price of $ 1 - 2 each , but in @entity192 the price can go much higher			1
" the @entity71 mango sells for $ 80 a piece , " says @entity59			2
" it 's given as a gift because its red color is a symbol of luck and abundance			0
" mango tastings do n't have to involve the fruit in its pure form			0
cut , cooked , creamed soon i find myself trying mango - based dishes like sticky rice with mango , mango ceviche and mango chutneys offered by local vendors and chefs			1
it all has a refreshing yet sweet flavor and the savory and spicy combinations intrigue me			0
its versatility makes it easy - to - use in salads , dips , chutneys , smoothies and even bread			0
but even after dozens of tastings , i 'm still looking at my notes unable to decide what makes a perfect mango			1
i seek alternative opinion once again			0
" i definitely do not like @entity183 , " says seven - year old son			1
" it 's super sour			0
" dr. @entity90 says it 's almost impossible to decide what the " best " mango is			0
but that does n't stop him picking one out			0
" my favorite is the @entity235 because i grew up with it , i have it in my backyard , " says @entity90			0
" it is safe and it reminds me of home			0
" after two days of exploration , numerous tastings and various conversations i finally decide on a favorite : i opt for the @entity62 from @entity246 , named after @entity73			1
it 's smooth , creamy and fragrant , its bold sweetness is addictive and i 'm intrigued by the color			0
it 's just a shame my choice means excluding so many delicious others .			0

the @entity17 takes places every year in @entity19 , bringing together mango enthusiasts and experts
dozens of varieties from around the world can be tasted , cooked and bid for during the two - day event
the @entity62 mango was named after @entity73 , who introduced mangoes to the @entity30 in early 1900s
