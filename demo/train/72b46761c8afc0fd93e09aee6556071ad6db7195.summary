when a college girlfriend called to tell me she was dating someone new , i asked the standard , superficial questions any 20 - something pal would : " how tall ? " " he 's a foot taller than me ! " " what does he do ? " " he 's actually just finishing up school			1
" " he 's in your master 's program ? " " not quite			2
" at the time , a year ago now , he was 20 and she was 23			1
mrs. @entity14 she 's not ; their three - year age difference is n't exactly shocking			1
it makes sense that two students ( she was earning a master 's degree and he was working toward his bachelor 's ) would meet working a part - time job			1
yet , during a recent gathering of girlfriends , she seemed to be the target of as many cougar jokes as @entity30 was in 2008 when she married @entity31			2
( at 32 , @entity31 is a decade younger than the singer			1
) it probably did n't help that , at the start of their relationship , my friend 's suitor could n't legally accompany her to the bar			2
" it makes people really uncomfortable for some reason , " she said in response to my own mindless cougar quip			2
as the public becomes accustomed to tales of 40 - and 50 - year - old women who date younger men , 20 - and 30 - something women who do the same are still regarded as a strange species			1
in popular parlance , these young lovers of even younger men are dubbed " pumas			1
" take actress @entity56 , for example			1
after announcing her engagement to 23 - year - old baseball player @entity60 last week , the 31 - year - old took flak in some online comment sections			1
" i ca n't imagine being 31 and relating so much to a 23 y / o male ... they are too immature still ! " said one commenter			1
another called @entity56 " a mini cougar			1
" one @entity69 commenter even suggested that 2013 was " the year of the ' young - er cougar , ' " noting that race car driver and model @entity70 , 30 , is dating fellow driver @entity73 , 25			1
three to five years hardly calls for puma and cougar jokes , said @entity77 , a professor of history and gender studies at @entity80			2
if it were the women who were three to five years younger , he added , people would say it 's the perfect age gap			1
" the biggest obstacle ( these couples ) are going to face is this enduring myth that boys develop more slowly than girls , " @entity77 said			2
" we just repeat that as if that 's absolutely true			0
it is developmentally largely true when dealing with infants and toddlers ... but once you get to adulthood , you know , 18 is 18			0
" of course , as far as " @entity98 " is concerned , 18 is n't always 18			0
while @entity101 jokes that she 's " not really into the whole cougar thing " regarding a guy two years her junior , her seemingly teenage vampire boyfriend is actually more than 100 years older than she is -- and that 's not creepy at all ? as more @entity110 actresses and models , such as @entity112 , date younger men , the unwarranted stigma surrounding such relationships will fade , matchmaker @entity106 said			1
but for now , a celebuzz gallery titled " @entity110 's cougars " includes @entity116 and @entity117			0
she 's four months older than he is			0
@entity106 's general rule of thumb for dating , regardless of who is on the winter end of the may - december romance , is " 10 up , 10 down			1
" if a couple is 11 years apart in age , she said , " do n't cry			0
it 's no big deal			0
but if you go 15 , you 're screwed			0
" @entity106 has also mentioned this notion on her reality show , " @entity129 , " which is in its sixth season on @entity131			0
on the series , she often takes on male and female clients who are looking for someone significantly younger than they are			1
when that happens , @entity106 added , cultural references are lost and one person assumes the caretaker role , which can be a problem when that person is the woman			0
" when you do 15 years , when you do @entity142 and @entity143 , it 's going to run its course , " she added			0
" it ca n't last when the woman is older than the man			0
when the man is older than the woman , unfortunately , there is a double standard and it does last			0
especially in different cultures ... that is the norm because a man is supposed to provide and guide for his woman			0
" the puma and cougar debate also has a place among gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender daters , though the lines are blurrier			0
when 26 - year - old actress @entity163 and 36 - year - old photographer @entity164 went public with their relationship in 2010 , age was n't at the forefront of reports the way it was for @entity30 and @entity31			1
" opinions on age difference run the gamut from fearful to desirable , " author @entity173 wrote regarding the gay community in his @entity176 column , " @entity177			0
" " there 's no hard and fast rule on whether age differences sink the love boat , " @entity173 wrote			0
" but age is definitely a factor when you date someone			1
... in my research with gay men for my book , ' @entity187 , ' i never met one who described a date without telling me the guy 's age first			1
" as @entity77 says , " the problem is largely cultural at this time			0
... ( there will be ) jokes about robbing a cradle			0
the expectations are somehow that ( a woman is ) not capable of being with a grown man and has thus chosen to date someone who our society thinks of as a boy			1
" in october , @entity207 - based video blogger @entity206 , 28 , posted a video about the benefits of dating a younger man			1
the comedic vlog listed reasons such as " younger guys try harder to please you " and " you get to feel more in charge " among the perks			2
another plus for some career - driven , powerful women in their 20s and 30s , @entity77 said , is that millennial men tend to be more open about gender roles			1
" for decades women have moved into traditionally male spaces , " he added			2
" with some millennial guys ... we 're not seeing more guys who are feminine , but flexible			0
" for my friend , the best thing about dating a younger man -- at least her younger man -- is that there 's no noticeable age difference at all			2
i can pick on her all i want for dating someone the same age as my younger sister			2
and i 'll probably continue to do so -- out of love , of course			0
but truth be told , there 's less of a cultural gap between her and her younger beau than there was between my last boyfriend and me			2
at six years my senior , he was behind the wheel of a car while i was still riding around the neighborhood on my @entity252 scooter			0
at least my " cougar " friend and her juvenile boyfriend can both recall growing up listening to cassette tapes , playing video games on the original @entity257 , and watching @entity258 deny that he had " sexual relations with that woman " -- even if one of them was n't quite sure what that meant at the ripe old age of 6 .			0

after announcing her engagement to a 23 - year - old , @entity56 , 31 , took flak
20 - and 30 - something women who date younger men are seen as strange by some
in popular parlance , these young lovers of even younger men are dubbed " pumas "
