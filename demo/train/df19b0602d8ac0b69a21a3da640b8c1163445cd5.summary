-- an internal report by the @entity2 has found that it committed no wrongdoing in the case of internet activist @entity5 , who committed suicide while facing charges he hacked into the university 's computers and stole millions of online documents			1
the report " makes clear that @entity2 did not ' target ' @entity5 , we did not seek federal prosecution , punishment or jail time , and we did not oppose a plea bargain , " wrote @entity2 president @entity11 in a letter tuesday to the @entity2 community			1
@entity11 had requested an analysis of the university 's involvement in the federal case against @entity5 from the time @entity2 first perceived unusual activity on its web network in 2010			1
but the report also questioned @entity2 's " neutral " policy on the issues raised by @entity5 's prosecution and suggested the university could have showed more leadership			1
it also asked whether @entity2 should become involved in debates over reform of the @entity35 -- one of the laws under which @entity5 was charged			0
@entity5 , 26 , was discovered dead in his @entity39 , @entity40 , apartment in january			0

if convicted on the federal computer - fraud charges , he faced up to 35 years in prison			0
internet prodigy , activist @entity5 commits suicide @entity5 was an @entity53 savant who helped develop social - news site @entity56 and @entity57 , the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers			2
he was an outspoken advocate for the free exchange of information over the @entity53 and co-founded @entity64 , a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship			0
as described in the report , @entity5 's death " ignited a firestorm on the @entity53			2
" admirers held memorial services , a petition on the @entity74 's website demanded the firing of the federal prosecutor responsible for the case and members of @entity79 introduced a proposed revision of the law under which he was prosecuted			0
after his suicide , @entity5 's family issued a statement criticizing prosecutors for seeking " an exceptionally harsh array of charges ( for ) an alleged crime that had no victims , " and claiming that decisions made by prosecutors and @entity2 officials had " contributed to his death			1
" how @entity5 helped build the internet the @entity2 report on @entity5 was issued by a review panel led by @entity99 , an @entity2 professor of electrical engineering and computer science			2
in preparing its report , the panel reviewed about 10,000 pages of documents and interviewed about 50 people , including @entity2 faculty , students , alumni and staff ; lawyers , police officers and prosecutors ; and @entity5 's friends and family			1
" the review panel 's careful account provides something we have not had until now : an independent description of the actual events at @entity2 and of @entity2 's decisions in the context of what @entity2 knew as the events unfolded , " @entity11 wrote in his accompanying letter			1
" from studying this review of @entity2 's role , i am confident that @entity2 's decisions were reasonable , appropriate and made in good faith			1
" but others disagreed , including @entity5 's family and romantic partner			2
" having now read @entity99 's report , it is clear that @entity2 in fact played a central role in @entity5 's suicide , " @entity134 , @entity5 's father , said in an e-mailed statement through a family friend			1
" @entity2 made numerous mistakes that warrant further examination and significant changes			0
@entity2 was not neutral in the legal case against @entity5			2
and whether @entity2 was neutral or not is a red herring : the university had a moral obligation to advocate on @entity5 's behalf			1
" @entity134 had some conciliatory reaction as well			0
" we are encouraged by @entity2 president @entity153 's desire to ensure that some positive comes of the terrible , tragic situation in which @entity5 found himself , and applaud @entity2 for its commitment to self - examination			1
" @entity5 's partner was upset at the report			2
" @entity2 's behavior throughout the case was reprehensible , and this report is quite frankly a whitewash , " said @entity159			1
" we have an institution to contrast @entity2 with -- @entity44 , who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution			0
@entity5 would be alive today if @entity2 had acted as @entity44 did			0
@entity2 had a moral imperative to do so , " she said			0
there was further reaction , too			0
" today 's report was intended to provide closure for the @entity2 community regarding the overprosecution and tragic loss of @entity5			2
instead , the report simply whitewashes @entity2 's role in @entity5 's prosecution and revises history to protect @entity2 's image , " said @entity64 campaigner @entity176			1
" @entity2 does not seem to understand that a few simple , reasonable actions would have saved @entity5 's life , " @entity176 added			1
" if the university had said publicly , ' we do n't want this prosecution to go forward , ' there would have been no case , and @entity5 would be alive today			0
