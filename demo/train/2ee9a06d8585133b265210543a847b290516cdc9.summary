" there 's a definitely a second day and there will be a third and more			0
this is going to go on , " he added			0
@entity0 insisted , however , that airstrikes are n't designed to defeat @entity2 by themselves			1
" you and others should not be looking for some massive retreat in the next week or two , " he told @entity17			0
more airstrikes against @entity2 @entity39 effort against @entity2 the campaign will be lengthy , @entity0 said , partly because the @entity3 military needs to be reconstituted , and because it will take time to arrange the kind of local support similar to the @entity45 years ago			1
the secretary of state said the battle to stop @entity2 is a multifaceted effort that includes foreign fighters , cutting off financing , and a major effort to " reclaim @entity52 by @entity53			1
" @entity2 is a threat to the people in the region , he said , but also to national sovereignty			2

does hurting @entity2 help @entity78 ? " the @entity22 regime has shown that it can not and will not confront these safe havens effectively itself , " @entity79 , the @entity19 ambassador to the @entity71 , wrote in a letter obtained by @entity18			0
" accordingly , the @entity19 has initiated necessary and proportionate military actions in @entity22			0
" share your view on the airstrikes other targets the first wave of airstrikes mostly targeted the @entity90 , which @entity28 described as " seasoned @entity92 operatives in @entity22			1

and the secretary of state softened previous declarations from the president that no @entity19 troops would become engaged in a ground war , a statement that many in @entity111 and even some military advisers say is unrealistic			1
