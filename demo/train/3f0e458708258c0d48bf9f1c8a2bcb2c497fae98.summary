-- isolated in the moment , the shooting death of @entity2 may seem a singular tragedy : a teenager mistaken for a criminal by an overzealous neighborhood watchman armed with a gun and backed by a state law that gives greater latitude to people to defend themselves when they feel threatened			1
but that moment in february in the central @entity13 town of @entity14 was steeped in a history that has haunted the state , the @entity17 and the country for generations			1
no matter the state , the circumstances are eerily familiar : a slaying			0
a suspect known to authorities			0
protests and outrage in a racially charged atmosphere			0
@entity13 is known for its amusement parks , beaches and pensioners from the @entity34			1
but history bears out that @entity13 has been as much a part of the @entity17 and its vigilante - enforced racial caste system as @entity38 and @entity39			1
in 1920 , a white mob burned down the black section of @entity42 , @entity13 , 30 miles west of @entity14 , when two " colored " men tried to vote			1
the two black men were killed for having gone to the polls			1
the black people who survived the massacre fled			1
the town remained all - white for generations			2
three years later , a white mob burned and leveled the town of @entity52 , a black settlement by the @entity54 , 140 miles west of @entity14 , after a white woman said a " colored " man had attacked her			1
it was where , a survivor said , " anything that was black or looked black was killed			2
" it was in 1934 that perhaps the single worst act of torture and execution in 20th - century @entity66 happened			2
in the @entity68 town of @entity69 , a farm settlement between @entity71 and @entity72 , a 23 - year - old black field hand named @entity74 was accused of the rape and murder of a 20 - year - old white woman			1
he was arrested and signed a written confession that some historians have since called into question			0
a mob of more than 300 men armed with guns , torches and dynamite went searching for @entity74 in every jail in a 75 - mile radius			1
the manhunt forced authorities to move @entity74 across the @entity68 -- by car and by boat , with the mob on their trail at every turn -- before they took him out of the state altogether , to the tiny town of @entity98 , @entity39			0
someone leaked @entity74 's whereabouts , and a lynching party stormed the jail and took @entity74 , his wrists hogtied , back to @entity69			0
it went over the news wires that he would be lynched the following day			0
thousands gathered to see the lynching , so many people that the lynching party , fearing a riot , decided to take him to the woods			2
there they castrated him and tortured him for hours with such cruelty that one of the lynchers was reported to have thrown up			0
@entity74 's body was dragged through town and hanged from an oak tree on the courthouse lawn , his fingers displayed as souvenirs			0
no one was ever charged or spent a day in jail for @entity74 's murder			0
in 1951 , the first casualties of the modern civil rights movement , @entity127 , and his wife , @entity128 , were fatally wounded in @entity129 , @entity13 , 30 miles east of @entity14 , when a bomb exploded under their bed on christmas day			1
@entity127 had been the lone representative of the @entity133 in @entity13 , crisscrossing the state to get equal wages for black teachers and the right to vote for blacks , who were denied that right in @entity13 and the rest of the @entity17			1
in more recent times , the first major race riots in the post-civil rights era erupted in @entity143 over a series of shootings of black men at the hands of white police officers who were all acquitted in the slayings			1
in 1979 , @entity150 , a black @entity152 veteran and insurance salesman , was killed after a high - speed chase			1
the police said he had died from the crash of his motorcycle			0
but the coroner discovered multiple blunt - force wounds inconsistent with a crash			2
a police investigation found that the officers had pulled @entity150 from the bike , handcuffed him and took turns beating him with nightsticks and flashlights until he was motionless			0
the officers then gouged the road with tire tracks and drove over the motorcycle so that there would appear to have been a crash			0
the verdict set off rioting in @entity143 in may 1980 that left 18 people dead and more than 1,000 arrested			2
in 1982 , @entity177 , a 20 - year - old black man , who had worked as a @entity179 messenger , was shot dead at a video arcade in @entity143 by a @entity182 - born police officer			1
the shooting set off three days of rioting in @entity143			0
and in 1989 , a block from the arcade where @entity177 was slain , @entity186 was shot dead on his motorcycle by a @entity191 - born police officer after a routine traffic stop			2
a passenger , also a black male , was killed when the motorcycle crashed			0
the police officer said he was acting in self - defense			0
he was acquitted of manslaughter in 1993 in @entity197			0
each case has its complexities , and each reflects an atmosphere that extends far beyond the @entity13 border			1
it 's a moral challenge not for just one state but for @entity66			0
each case has a similar algorithm of caste and controversy in a region where old wounds appear to have yet to heal			2
but while each of the previous cases seems almost lost to memory now , it is the national outpouring of outrage from people of all backgrounds in response to the @entity2 case that could signal the difference between the last century and this one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : @entity2 case not first @entity13 killing with racial *overtones* and no arrest
black men murdered for trying to vote , black towns burned to ground , she says
@entity223 : @entity13 has been part of the @entity17 and its vigilante - enforced racial caste system
the difference in @entity2 case is people of all backgrounds are outraged , @entity223 says
