singing competition shows like " @entity2 " and " @entity3 " do n't only make stars , they rehabilitate them			1
just ask @entity5 , whose seat at the " @entity2 " judges ' table paved the way for the success of her 2011 album and her recently announced summer tour			1
or @entity13 , who benefited greatly from frontman @entity16 's spot on " @entity3			0
" even his fellow " @entity3 " judge , @entity17 , cashed in on the group 's best - selling single " @entity18			0
" but for a megawatt star like @entity21 , who already experienced a comeback of sorts in 2008 with the release of " circus " not long after her fall from grace , a judging and mentoring gig on " @entity28 " is n't needed to sell albums			1
unlike her aforementioned reality show judge counterparts , @entity21 joins the @entity33 singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album , and her worldwide " @entity36			1
" even the star 's personal life appears to be more in order these days			0
but the pop princess has n't exactly been accessible to her fans since she was placed in a conservatorship in 2008			1
and as stars like @entity45 and @entity46 have figured out , there 's more to being a singing sensation in 2012 than meets the ear			2
fans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level , said @entity52 , an associate editor at @entity53			1
becoming a mainstay on a show like " @entity28 , " and showing off her personality each week , could reignite the level of fame spears experienced in the early 2000s , @entity52 added			1
referencing the way @entity45 uses @entity60 to stay connected to her fans , which she often calls her " little monsters , " @entity52 said , " ( @entity45 ) is part of their daily life , while @entity21 is not			1
and her handlers are realizing they have to loosen the reins a bit			0
" even @entity46 has opened up to her fans since the birth of her daughter , @entity70 , joining @entity60 and giving an intimate glimpse of her offstage life via her @entity74 page			2
though @entity21 has used social platforms to share pictures of her two sons and announce her engagement to former manager @entity79 , she 's come off as a sort of " @entity82 " pop star of late , @entity52 said			2
" she walks around like a robot			0
people ca n't relate to that , " he said			0
" this could prove to be a whole new phase of her career			0
" and lucky for @entity21 because , with a reported $ 15 million contract to appear on " @entity28 , " this move is likely less about the money than it is about rebuilding her image			2
" @entity21 off the cuff does n't exist , " said @entity94 , @entity95 's senior correspondent for film and tv			1
" it 's really been a while since we 've heard her give any kind of expansive commentary			0
" to that end , there 's a risk involved , because " the no. 1 dangerous thing that could happen , " @entity94 said , " is if the artist does n't appear genuine			0
you have to feel like that 's @entity21 saying what @entity21 wants to say			2
it ca n't feel scripted , like she has someone in her ear telling her what to say			0
" while " @entity28 " played hardball in the ratings game last fall , fluctuating from 8.5 to 12.5 million viewers each week , the singing competition underwhelmed critics thanks to @entity122 's prediction that anything less than 20 million in viewers would be unacceptable			1
however , with @entity126 at the judges ' table , ratings probably wo n't be a concern , @entity94 said			0
if the show starts pulling " idol " - like numbers , he added , " it will be driven by , ' what did @entity21 say ? ' ' what is @entity21 going to say ? ' out of the gate , that 's what it is			1
" @entity52 agrees people will tune in , if only to hear her talk			0
" if you were a young person between ' 98 and ' 07 , you find @entity21 fascinating , " he said			2
" there 's just no way around it ... between her craziness and absence			0
" of course , @entity52 added , @entity21 's team probably would n't let her on live tv if she could n't handle it			1
" there 's a vote of confidence on @entity33 's part and @entity122 's part and @entity21 's team 's part to say she 's ready , and if it goes right , the potential is huge , " he said			1
" the real @entity21 i used to see is bubbly and funny			2
it would be nice to see that again			0
