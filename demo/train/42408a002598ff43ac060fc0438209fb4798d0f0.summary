-- on sunday evening , as i was diligently not watching the @entity3 , the e-mails started arriving : had i seen that @entity5 commercial of @entity6 's ? was n't it ridiculous , @entity6 selling out to an @entity9 - owned car company in the most expensive television ad buy of the year ? because i 've written about @entity6 as well as for his official website , friends and occasional strangers contact me from time to time furious about his latest corrupt outrage , proclaiming he has finally destroyed whatever shred of integrity he had left			1
i heard it in 2011 , when @entity6 supposedly sold out by performing a concert in repressive @entity20			2
i had heard it four years earlier , when he appeared in his first car ad for @entity23 , which just happened to be sponsoring a satellite radio show he was hosting at the time			2
i heard it three years before when he turned up in his cowboy troubadour duds wandering around a beautiful scantily clad model in a @entity32 's @entity31 ad			2
to borrow one of the late @entity35 's lyrics : when will they ever learn ? @entity6 has been accused of selling out for 50 years , beginning in 1962 when he signed a recording contract with a big - time label , @entity38			1
two years later , the left - wing commissars of the folk revival denounced him for writing inward - looking emotional songs instead of " protest " anthems			0
soon thereafter came the rage at his writing for and playing with electric blues and rock musicians , a supposed betrayal of folk purity			0
and so it has continued , from the sellouts of his going country on " @entity53 " and later , writing gospel music , to today 's shilling for soft - core porn lingerie and poisonous gas guzzlers			0
always , the sanctimonious detractors cling to a bygone @entity6 : a skinny , tousled - haired genius in a work shirt singing " @entity61 " and " @entity62			1
" this , supposedly , is the true @entity6 that the actual man has desecrated			2
in fact , the profane actual @entity6 is worse than corrupt : he is the vile betrayer of a revolution in consciousness of which he had once been the avatar			0
but @entity6 renounced that role 50 years ago			1
choosing art over politics , he broke free of the moral absolutism of " protest " music that he mocked in " @entity75 " in 1964 : " ah , but i was so much older then / i 'm younger than that now			0
" he rejected the idea of his being the avatar of anything , let alone of a revolution in consciousness			0
" it 's never been my duty to remake the world at large , " he sang in " @entity87 , " from 1973 , " nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge			0
" and so i started to write back to my complaining friends to say that they had totally missed what @entity6 has been about for decades -- not a moral or spiritual guide , let alone an exemplar , or a prophet , or a savior , but a working songwriter and musician , doing his job as best he can -- which , astonishingly often , turns out to be sublime -- and making the money he deserves			0
then i watched the commercial on @entity104 and saw that my riposte was inadequate			0
for @entity6 , breaking free of the folkie left and choosing art over politics never meant renouncing political concerns or themes , any more than turning to rock meant repudiating folk music			0
any conception of art as broad as @entity6 's necessarily includes politics , as politics is part of the human endeavor			1
and the @entity5 ad , while captivating us with @entity6 's very presence , contains a political subtext			1
although the ad is dopey as all ads are , and even though it is plainly hawking @entity5 , @entity6 never once hypes the virtues of @entity5 's product over that of any other automobile maker			1
this may be a cunningly subtle pitch to @entity6 's baby boomer fan base , but it 's also an abnormal nonspecific celebrity endorsement			1
instead , @entity6 celebrates @entity133 as a car - loving country			0
the ad begins with a clunky , even insipid piece of ad copy -- " there 's nothing more @entity142 than @entity133 " -- only barely redeemed by being spoken by @entity6 's singular voice			1
but then comes a jumble of images out of @entity6 's familiar @entity146 landscape -- old - fashioned diners , @entity148 in @entity149 , bronco busters , carnivals , @entity152 -- evoking a particular nostalgic national mystique , rooted in the 1940s and 1950s and redolent of @entity156			1
footage of old @entity158 follows -- " yeah ... , " @entity6 says , " @entity158 made cars , and cars made @entity133 " -- and then a paean , in prose almost certainly written by @entity6 himself , to " the @entity142 road and the creatures who live on it " and to how we @entity133 " believe in the zoom and the roar and the thrust			2
" the ad is saying that @entity133 is what its people make and make of it , cars above all , which makes sense -- and which also makes it a workingman 's film : the ad does n't single out @entity5 and its cars but the @entity133 who build those cars , and their conviction and pride -- " the heart and soul of every man and woman working on the line , " @entity6 intones			1
" so let @entity190 brew your beer , let @entity193 make your watch , let @entity195 assemble your phone			0
we ... will build ... your car " -- the last sentence delivered in @entity6 's cool halting cadence			1
it 's all , of course , a cleverly deceptive way to elide the fact that supposedly all - american @entity5 is now owned by @entity205			2
but the cars are still @entity142 - made -- and for @entity6 , that 's important			1
in one of his early protest songs , " @entity218 , " @entity6 sang of the mines of his native @entity210 @entity209 being shut down and people left in despair , because for the greedy owners it was " much cheaper down / in @entity142 towns / where the miners work almost for nothing			1
" twenty years later , in " @entity221 , " he bitterly lamented what had now become known as outsourcing , including @entity142 cars being assembled in @entity225 " by a guy making 30 cents a day			2
" " @entity231 # 2 , " from 2006 , complained of how " they say low wages are a reality / if we want to compete abroad			0
" pro-labor protectionism does not spring to mind as one of the great causes of the 1960s			0
but for @entity6 , a product of the 1940s and 1950s , one article of simple justice has always been that @entity142 working people , so vital to his vanishing @entity142 landscape , ought not to be victimized by bosses who will happily exploit the pauper labor of the rest of the world			1
apparently , @entity6 is sold on the idea that , in @entity158 anyway , that injustice has been halted and even reversed			0
and that , he wants us to know , is a good reason , and maybe the best , to buy one of @entity5 's cars			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			0

@entity256 : people outraged by @entity6 's @entity5 ad , saying he has no *credibility*
@entity256 : but @entity6 accused of selling out for 50 years , for musical changes and ads
he says everybody wants the skinny genius in a work shirt singing " @entity61 "
@entity256 : @entity6 's *promoted* @entity142 workers for years , and that 's what his ad does
