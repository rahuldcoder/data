@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities have raided two premises and seized nine babies -- allegedly fathered by one @entity7 man -- as part of the country 's crackdown on suspected illegal surrogacy			1
one of the raids was on an ivf clinic involved in the birth of @entity15 , a seven - month - old boy with @entity16 left in @entity3 by his @entity18 parents			1
the case has made international headlines amid accusations from his surrogate mother , @entity22 , that @entity15 's parents were n't interested in taking their son , who also has a serious heart condition			1
the parents have denied that they wanted to leave him , according to a statement from a friend to the @entity31 , who said they were told their gravely ill baby was going to die			2
@entity7 man wanted ' a big family ' along with the raid on the clinic , authorities searched a condominium in the @entity41 area of @entity0 after receiving a tip - off about the presence of several women and babies			1
police found nine babies , ranging in age from newborns to one year old , who were being cared for by seven @entity3 " nannies , " said @entity52 , chairwoman and founder of the @entity54			1
all of the children appeared to have been well taken care of and had been moved to a government - run orphanage , she said			0
police colonel @entity59 said a @entity3 lawyer acting for a @entity7 man claimed the babies belonged to his client			1
he wanted to build " a big family , " the lawyer said			0
" it is very unusual for a father to have nine babies at the same time , " said @entity65 , head of @entity3 's @entity66 , adding that police were continuing to question the nannies			1
code of conduct ' breached ' the raids came amid an international furor over the fate of baby @entity15 , who was born via surrogate with his twin sister in december			1
their parents took the female twin back to their home in @entity82 , @entity83 , leaving their son with the surrogate mother who was concerned how she 'd pay for his care			2
at a press conference in @entity0 on thursday , @entity65 said it was " very clear " that the clinic involved in @entity15 's birth had broken the law governing the establishment of medical facilities			2
he said the clinic had failed to ensure its doctors followed the @entity97 's @entity96			0
the code states that surrogacy is allowed only when the surrogate is a blood relative of the parents and does n't receive any payment			2
" it 's clear for this case that ( @entity22 ) is not a relative and also she has received money to carry the baby , " @entity65 said			0
authorities have previously said they would not pursue legal action against @entity15 's mother , a 21 - year - old food stall worker who is caring for the baby alongside her own two children , aged six and three			1
however , if charged and convicted , the clinic operator faces one year in prison and a fine of 20,000 baht ( us $ 619 )			0
the doctor who performed the procedure could also be struck off			0
the @entity97 is currently reviewing the doctor 's medical license , @entity65 said			0
