@entity0 -- @entity2 lit into members of @entity4 on wednesday night in @entity0 , questioning their resolve to legislate as opposed to their desire to play politics			1
" the basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle , particularly at this point in history , on the other side of the aisle , who are more interested in governing than in posturing , more interested in problem solving than in partisanship , " @entity9 told an audience of business leaders at @entity12 of @entity0 on wednesday night			1
@entity9 , the former senator from @entity25 and @entity27 ' presidential favorite , said this became clear for her during the 16 - day partial government shutdown in 2013 , when president @entity31 had to cancel his trip to the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			1
at the time @entity9 was secretary of state			2
" i do n't care what party you are , @entity27 never did that to @entity38 despite our deep differences with president @entity38 on taxes , on @entity42 , on so many other things , " @entity9 said			2
" we never did it			0
" @entity9 waffles on @entity46 tax question @entity9 's remarks were more stepped up than in the past , questioning not only @entity4 ' resolve , but their commitment to doing their jobs			1
" you have to ask yourself , do these particular members of @entity4 really understand the world ? understand what it means for the @entity57 to lead and to be perceived as a leader ? or do they just not care , " @entity9 posited			1
" do they just have a whole other agenda that enables them to say whatever they want to say and spout whatever rhetoric they want to spout ? " @entity9 has been outspoken in her longing for political leaders who could negotiate and cut deals			2
her stump speech regularly includes lines that decry partisan politics			0
" it is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for @entity4 , both @entity79 and @entity80 , who proudly go around their districts and their states proclaiming that you should send them to @entity85 because they will never compromise , " @entity9 said , pulling a line from previous speeches			1
sizing up a @entity9 - @entity87 race @entity9 urged the 900 well - heeled business leaders and philanthropists in the room to make their disapproval known			2
" that is why it is imperative that you have people in business and other positions of responsibility basically say ... ' get out there and do your job			0
stay off the talk shows			0
get back to the @entity4			0
legislate and solve @entity57 's problems			0
' " she added later , in an apparent appeal to independents , this call : " the only way to solve this is for the @entity57 people , the @entity57 voters ... who constitute the great middle of the @entity57 political system , to just call a halt to it			0
