-- federal prosecutors revealed a photograph thursday that they say show an @entity4 man attacking another @entity4 man by attempting to forcibly cut his beard			1
the photo was submitted as evidence in the trial of 16 @entity4 men and women charged with federal hate crimes in connection with last year 's beard - cutting attacks in rural eastern @entity15			1
the trial started monday at federal court in @entity18 with jury selection			2
to the @entity4 , a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhood			1
the photo was recovered from a disposable camera that was used to document the attacks , which prosecutors say were ordered by @entity28 , the @entity4 leader of a breakaway sect and one of the 16 defendants			1
prosecutors did not identify the attacker or the victim in the photo in their court filings			1
if convicted , @entity28 faces 20 years in prison , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity38 in @entity18			0
according to witnesses cited in a federal affidavit , @entity28 " forced extreme punishments " on anyone in his community who defied him , " including forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop on his property			1
" in addition , the affidavit alleges that , as the bishop of his @entity4 clan in @entity52 , @entity15 , @entity28 had " acts of sexual intimacy " with married women as part of " counseling " to " cleanse them of the devil			1
" @entity0 has sought a response from @entity28 's attorney , @entity61			2
@entity61 has disputed the prosecution 's characterization of his client , according to the @entity65			2
" they 're trying to create this perception he 's something he 's not , " @entity61 told the newspaper			2
" he 's not a wacky cult leader			2
he 's a decent , hardworking , caring man			2
" usually , the @entity4 resolve disputes without involving law enforcement , but concerns that @entity28 is operating a cult on his compound prompted some to report the beard - cutting incidents to police last fall			1
@entity78 was held down by men armed with scissors and battery - powered clippers who cut off a chunk of his beard , according to a police report			2
@entity87 said she and her husband decided to report the cutting to police in hopes of preventing other people from being hurt , including @entity28 's followers , who " need help , " she said			0
" there 's a lot of lives being messed up down there			0
there 's a lot of people being abused and brainwashed , " @entity87 said			0
the @entity102 said that a fear of reprisal attacks prompted them and other @entity4 residents in rural eastern @entity15 to lock their doors at night -- something unheard - of in @entity4 communities			1
@entity28 's sect is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around an 800 - acre compound in a remote valley outside @entity52 , according to @entity114 @entity113			0
prosecutors have said @entity28 " exerted control over the @entity52 community by taking the wives of other men into his home and by overseeing various means of disciplining community members , including corporal punishment			1
" those accusations could play a key part in the trial against @entity28 and his co-defendants			0
last week , a federal judge ruled that witnesses can testify about @entity28 's alleged sexual activities at his compound in @entity52 , according to @entity65			2
when reports of the beard - cutting attacks surfaced last fall , they uncovered an ongoing split between @entity28 's sect and the larger @entity4 community in and around @entity52 , many of whom believe that @entity28 is creating rules and punishments that do not fit with the broader @entity4 belief system			1
@entity143 said he was once part of the @entity28 family compound			0
he married @entity28 's daughter , @entity146 , and the couple had two daughters			0
concerned about the way @entity28 was " ruling " his followers , @entity143 said , he started making arrangements to move his wife and children out of the group			0
not long after , @entity143 said , @entity28 began interfering with their marriage			0
@entity143 said @entity28 would ask women , including his wife , " about their sexual relationships with their husbands			0
" " that 's very atypical behavior for @entity4 to do that , " @entity143 said			1
" it 's unheard - of			0
" in the @entity4 community , no one has jurisdiction over what goes on between a husband and wife , " he said			1
" he 's the only guy and only leader that i know of that ever has gotten into an @entity4 couple 's married life			1
" @entity143 divorced and left the sect in 2007 with full custody of his two daughters			0
@entity0 traveled to @entity28 's compound last fall before his arrest , and @entity28 denied that he was running a cult			0
when asked about allegations that he orchestrated the beard - cutting attacks , he responded , " beard - cutting is a crime , is it ? " asked about the accusation that he split up his daughter 's marriage to @entity143 , @entity28 responded , " maybe you should ask the people whose beards were cut about the marriages they 've split up			1
" he refused to elaborate			0
@entity113 , the sheriff , said last fall that he fears the situation could come to a dramatic conclusion			0
" if i were to get a call right now telling me , ' @entity199 , they 're all dead in the community out there , ' it would n't surprise me , ' " he said			0
@entity0 goes inside the @entity28 compound @entity4 leader a millionaire , can pay for attorney hate crime charges filed in @entity4 beard cutting @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report .			1
