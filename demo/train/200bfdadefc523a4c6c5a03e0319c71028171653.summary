once again , @entity5 airline @entity4 grabs the top spot			1
" @entity4 continues to lead the industry with safety innovations and its fleet is now the youngest -- 7.9 years -- it has been since the airline was privatized in 1995 , " @entity0 editor @entity11 tells @entity0			1
he says the airline is an industry benchmark for best practice and has taken the lead in virtually every major advancement in airline safety over the past 60 years			2
rounding out the rest of the top 10 in alphabetical order are : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
" our top 10 safest airlines are always at the forefront of safety innovation and launching new planes , " says @entity11			1
@entity36 's rating system takes into account audits from aviation 's governing bodies and lead associations as well as government audits and the airlines ' fatality records			1
it also examines airlines ' operational histories , incident records and operational excellence			0
of the the 449 airlines it monitors , 149 have the top seven - star safety ranking			1
this year , the site also included a list of the top 10 safest low cost airlines for 2015			1
these are , in alphabetical order : @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , @entity61 ( @entity60 ) , @entity63 ( @entity62 ) , @entity64 ( @entity60 ) , @entity65 ( @entity5 ) , @entity67 ( @entity66 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , @entity70 ( @entity69 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 ) and @entity73 ( @entity59 )			0
" unlike a number of low cost carriers these airlines have all passed the stringent @entity78 audit and have excellent safety records , " says @entity11			2
" low cost does not mean low safety			0
" one fatal accident for every 1.3 million flights the release of the @entity0 list comes at a particularly sensitive time for fliers			1
while 2013 was one of the safest years in global aviation history , 2014 is considered one of the worst in recent years in terms of fatalities , due to several high - profile air incidents			1
@entity0 says there were 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities in 2014 -- higher than the 10 - year average			1
however , looking to the positive there were only 111 crashes in 2014 , the lowest number in more than 80 years says the @entity102 - based @entity101 , or @entity103			2
the last time the world had 111 crashes was in 1927			0
" if you consider sheer numbers of aircraft crashes , flying today is safer , " says @entity105 , an analyst with the @entity106 , a global aviation consulting group			0
" however , there are more aircraft in the sky , so naturally the overall number may appear similar to previous decades and , in some categories of disaster , higher			0
" according to a report on @entity36 , the world 's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights in 2014			1
" flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers -- 5 % of today 's number , " says the website			1
" another twist is that fatal accidents for 2014 were at a record low 21 -- one for every 1.3 million flights			1
two of the crashes last year -- @entity132 and @entity133 -- were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives			0
" in march , @entity132 disappeared en route from @entity137 to @entity138 with 239 aboard			0
officials believe that plane is somewhere in the @entity141			0
but , nearly 10 months later , @entity132 has n't been found			0
in july , @entity142 was shot down over eastern @entity143 , killing all 298 aboard			0
@entity144 has a five out of seven ranking on @entity36			0
@entity145 -- still reeling from the crash of @entity147 , which went down over the @entity148 on december 28 with 162 people on board -- has a four out of seven star ranking			2
prior to december , @entity152 had a near flawless safety record , with no previous fatal accidents			2
@entity156 's unsafest airlines @entity0 says if an airline has a crash that involves the death of a passenger and / or crew members it will automatically receive a deduction of one star , giving it a lower safety rating			1
" a crash involving fatalities carries with it a one star deduction for 10 years from the date of the incident , " says the website on a page explaining its ratings system			0
of the 449 airlines surveyed by @entity0 , nearly 50 have just three stars or less			1
four airlines only achieved one star for safety			2
two are from @entity177 -- @entity178 and @entity179 -- joining @entity181 's @entity180 and @entity183 's @entity182			0
all four are on a list of airlines banned from flying within the @entity187			0
the @entity60 does n't blacklist individual airlines , but it does make public a list of countries it judges to fall short of international aviation safety standards			2
@entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			2
