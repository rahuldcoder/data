@entity0 -- a year ago , 42 - year - old runner @entity2 never thought he 'd be excited just to see the starting line			1
but that was before he almost died			0
in fact , the father of two girls did n't breathe for a month ; a machine pushed oxygen through his body			2
now he 's training for another marathon			1
it all began in december with a bad bout of the flu that led to an acute bacterial infection			1
by the time he checked into the hospital , @entity2 was barely hanging on			1
" we walked into the triage , and his oxygen level was only 57 % , and everybody turned a corner , " @entity2 ' wife , @entity17 , told @entity1			1
healthy blood oxygen levels are higher than 95 %			1
@entity2 was in deep trouble			1
he had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome , also known as @entity27			2
it was slowly killing @entity2 by attacking his lungs			1
" not only that , but he had multiple organ failure related to the infection			2
so his kidneys were not working			0
his liver was not working			0
and his bone marrow was failing as well , " said dr. @entity34 , a cardiothoracic surgeon at the @entity35			0
@entity34 had no time to spare			2
he knew trying to force air into @entity2 ' lungs would do more harm than good			1
but without oxygen , @entity2 ' organs would soon shut down			1
@entity34 had one shot : a procedure called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , or @entity45			1
with this treatment , doctors turn down the patient 's respirator , then insert a special tube through the heart			2
a pump draws blood from the body , flushes it through an oxygenation machine that removes the carbon dioxide and delivers oxygen back to the heart			1
it functions as an external lung , without the patient taking a single breath			2
" so ( oxygenated blood ) could pass through the lungs , and the lungs did n't have to do anything to it because it was already processed , " @entity34 said			1
" and what we see on the x-ray is the lungs basically collapse down to nothing			2
... they are just resting			0
we support the patient until the lungs can heal on their own			1
" @entity2 ' family was told he had a 40 % to 50 % chance of survival			1
" dr. @entity34 initially said he thought he 'd be on @entity45 for a week , " @entity17 recalled			1
" then the week turned into two weeks			0
and then he 's just like , ' well , sometimes you just have to wait these things out			0
' " @entity34 said , " two weeks into it we were all pretty worried that we had this young guy whose lungs just did n't seem to be coming back			2
at the time , he was the patient we had had on @entity45 the longest in the history of our program			1
" two weeks became four			0
@entity2 did n't take a single breath for a month			1
" somewhat miraculously , his lungs just started to open up on their own , " @entity34 said			2
by that time , @entity2 was a shadow of his former self			1
he had lost more than 30 pounds			0
" you can imagine , before going into the hospital you are this active person			0
then you go in , they put you under , and when you wake ... you ca n't sit up , you ca n't move your arms up and you look at your legs , and they 're just not there anymore , " @entity2 said			2
" then you realize it 's far worse than you ever expected it to be			0
" still , he was determined to make a full recovery			0
seven weeks after entering the hospital , @entity2 got to go home			1
" i started out just walking a block and then pushing that out the following day to a block and a half , or two			0
then it was like walking to school with the girls , " he said			0
remarkably , just six months later , @entity2 is running			2
" my goal at the time was to be able to jog nonstop for three miles			0
and i did n't think that was going to happen until november			0
that happened in may , " he said			0
once he was able to cover three miles , the distance he usually started out at to train for a marathon , " that 's when i knew it was just a matter of time			1
" @entity2 has set his sights on completing the @entity122 on october 20			2
he 's already covered the 26.2 miles in a training run			0
@entity2 is n't running for time			1
he 's running just because he can			0
" every long run gets a little emotional for me this time around			0
i think of all the people who were there when i could n't do it for myself			0
i think of the nurses , people at work , my boss who sent cards ... neighbors , friends , family , all praying for me , " he said			0
