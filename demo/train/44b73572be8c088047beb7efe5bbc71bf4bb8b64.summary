-- it was about eight months into her fight with heart cancer that 24 - year - old @entity5 knew she was going to die			1
in november 2012 , @entity6 was diagnosed with cardiac sarcoma , a rare and aggressive form of cancer			1
by the end of september 2013 , she was gone			0
but it 's what happened in the final weeks of her life that made her friends and family feel as if she 's still around			1
" i met her by chance , actually , " filmmaker @entity20 told @entity0			1
" i went to the hospital because i was having some chest pains and we ended up having the same doctor			0
our conversations took off from there			0
" @entity20 happened to be working on a documentary about how people deal with the end of life			1
so he and @entity6 decided to document the last leg of her life and her final wishes			0
inspired by her favorite children 's book , " paddle to @entity45 , " in which a boy carves a wooden boat and sets it free in the @entity43 , @entity37 turned to her family and said , " i want to do that			1
i want to go to the ocean			0
cremate me and put my ashes in a boat			1
i want to go from @entity52 to the @entity53			1
" " she wanted to create a dialogue about cardiac sarcoma , " her older brother @entity6 told @entity0			1
" her dream was to be a nurse , because she loved helping people			0
she knew she was n't going to live to achieve that , so this was her way of helping people after she died			0
we all know someone with cancer			2
" sarcoma is a rare type of cancer , and cardiac sarcoma even rarer , according to dr. @entity72 , a cardiologist in @entity73 , @entity74 , who treated @entity6 , a former @entity77 private			1
" it can grow from any part of the body , even connective tissues			0
it usually happens to very healthy , young , individuals , " @entity72 told @entity0			0
" a purely genetic disease that 's rapid growing			2
it 's kind of like having a ticking time bomb in your body and no one is recognizing it			2
" three weeks before @entity6 's life ended , the plans to get her ashes to the @entity53 began			1
and @entity20 was there to document the whole thing			1
" it was just a little 3Â½ - foot boat carved out of wood by a totally blind carpenter			2
that 's what she wanted to have her ashes put in , " @entity20 said			1
" the hope was that , with the help of strangers , she would have her dream come true			2
as it turns out , it was kind of like the @entity108 torch			0
people wanted to be part of this journey			2
" an unpredictable journey that -- keeping true to the story in " @entity114 " -- would only work with the help of people @entity37 never met			0
to encourage the support , @entity37 had her family write a message on the small sail of the handcrafted wooden boat : " my name is @entity5			1
i died of cardiac sarcoma cancer			1
my ashes are enclosed in this boat and i am on my way to the ocean			1
if you find me , please send me back on my path			0
i 'll bless you from @entity131			0
" the boat set sail in @entity52 and in the weeks that followed , @entity37 's ashes would travel by water and over land , riding on everything from planes to trains to the sidecars of motorcycles			1
" @entity143 is really everybody 's story , " @entity20 told @entity0			1
" and @entity5 knew that			1
once the journey started , it was incredible watching people engage the boat			2
it created a dialogue of life after death			0
we knew it would resonate with people but we had no idea it would be this strong			0
" people helped on a whim , like @entity161 , who jumped into the @entity162 to rescue @entity37 's small boat , which had become stuck in the brush on the riverbank and was at risk of being lost			1
" so he runs down the bank of a river , takes his clothes off , swims down the canal and releases her			0
and people are all clapping and cheering , " @entity20 said , remembering the scene			2
" but then the boat stops again , directly under this group of 40 people watching it all from a balcony above the river			0
and i can see this woman is really upset			0
" along with @entity37 's written message on the boat 's sail were 12 random names of people @entity187 had chosen from across the country who , like @entity37 , had died from cancer			1
one of the names was @entity192			0
" the women turns to me and says , ' @entity192 ? that was my dad 's name			0
he died 20 years ago from lung cancer , ' " @entity20 said			1
" it turns out in life , chance encounters are n't so chance at all			0
" before she died , @entity5 said , " you ca n't really predict your own future			2
there 's always a road that 's going to pop up out of nowhere			0
and that 's why life is a journey			2
" on july 26 , in @entity212 , her journey ended when her ashes made it to the @entity53 , just as the sun was setting			1
" when @entity5 told me she wanted to do this , i promised her that we 'd get her there			1
and we did , " @entity20 said			2
" in that little gleaming moment you just knew that you were doing something that was supposed to be done for somebody			0
it is a transcendental journey			0
@entity5 , who nobody knew , so many people will meet			2
" @entity226 sews a new dream after toddler 's death teen who inspired many with ' clouds ' song passes @entity0 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
