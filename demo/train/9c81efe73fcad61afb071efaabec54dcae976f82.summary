@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's more than two hours before snowboard practice begins , two hours before @entity5 will take his first picture , and he is trudging up the steep icy slope that is one lip of the halfpipe			1
temperatures are just above freezing on @entity10 , and @entity5 , a @entity11 photographer for 24 years , is steadily ambling up the hill to stake out his position near the top			1
the climb is just 160 meters , but try doing it with a 50 - or 60 - pound pack on your back and a bad knee repaired just three weeks ago			2
it 's going to be worth it ; @entity5 knows precisely where he needs to be to get the perfect picture when the overwhelming gold medal favorite @entity27 performs			1
for the next nine hours @entity5 wo n't leave his spot -- he 's not allowed to come back down until the competition is over -- so he has a bag full of equipment and provisions			1
he carries three camera bodies , four lenses , several radios to remotely trigger cameras and a bunch of @entity39 bars			2
( @entity40 's might sponsor these games , but there 's no @entity43 on the hill )			2
see 19 of @entity5 's amazing @entity46 photos from the @entity47 he knows where to be to get the shot he wants because @entity5 and his assistant , @entity50 have been photographing @entity27 for months , learning his every move and tendency			1
for instance , @entity5 knows the best time to shoot a close - up of @entity27 is during his first practice run because the snowboarder does n't go as high then			1
they went to three @entity59 events and the @entity60 , shooting @entity27 and his competitors in preparation for the @entity47			1
then once in @entity0 it was off to every practice to test out different angles to shoot			2
" we 're trying to frame it just right , " @entity5 said on the drive from his hotel to the venue			1
" on their tricks , snowboarders are spinning so fast			0
sometimes you never see their faces			0
you do n't want to get pictures of rear ends or the bottom of the board			2
we want to get their faces if we can			0
" @entity5 , who has more than 50 @entity11 covers to his credit , is frustrated even before he climbs the hill			1
@entity50 is an important part of the " we " he talks about			0
@entity50 has been there for him for nearly seven years , handing him the right equipment , fixing things when they go wonky , running cards back to the work area and often being the voice of reason			2
but that wo n't happen today because officials would n't give @entity50 a photographer 's armband			2
he 's not even allowed to shoot pictures from a lower area of the venue			1
it 's almost like a pitcher without his catcher , though the understated @entity50 often is the one who shakes @entity5 off			1
and then there 's the eye roll			0
they have this way of disagreeing that only longtime friends can have			0
there 's often disagreement , @entity50 says , but they always come to an understanding			0
on this wednesday at the halfpipe , @entity50 will have to stay in front of a laptop all day , trying patiently to wait for runners to bring him the cards from the cameras			1
at least he has company			0
@entity117 , photographer @entity118 ' assistant , ca n't go with his photographer either			1
@entity120 will spot up on the other side of the pipe while photographer @entity123 will be positioned at the bottom			2
just before setting off for the hill , @entity5 gets a call from @entity127 , @entity46 's director of photography			1
@entity127 has a request for @entity5 to get @entity27 at a certain angle			1
@entity5 's sure he ca n't and tells @entity127 that he has a great shot in mind , looking up the pipe as @entity27 soars into action			1
fine likes that but wants to have one with the crowd in the background			0
@entity5 and @entity50 agree ; it 's not a clean shot from where @entity5 will be , but they can try and see what @entity127 says			1
you 'd think that @entity5 can call the shots , so to speak , and send in his favorites from the 1,400 images he will take this day , but that 's not the way it works			1
he lets the photo editors pick the ones they want			0
" i do n't suggest anything to those guys , " @entity5 said			1
" i ca n't control it			0
i make the best pictures i can , send them , in and it 's out of my hands			1
' he seems cool with that			0
he 's much more concerned with getting a shot that is different from other photogs			0
it 's difficult -- well , almost impossible really -- to be inventive with this assignment , though			2
there are going to be several other photographers in the same area , and dozens all over the pipe			0
he 'll try to nail it the best he can by using a different lens than others near him ( maybe a 35 mm while lying down in the snow ) and also through the use of a camera on a 12 - foot stick he 'll hold up			0
there 's one big issue , though , with @entity27			0
@entity5 says when he has used a remote - fired camera , he 's able to get other snowboarders in the frame perfectly , but @entity27 soars so high that much of the time he 's at the top of the frame , if he 's even in the picture			1
@entity5 's assignment is not solely white ; it 's just that the 23 - year - old budding legend is such a prohibitive favorite it makes sense to @entity5 that 's his main target			1
he 's shooting for the magazine , but he also hopes the web site can use his photos			1
in fact , the @entity193 is much more of a sure thing this time			0
@entity11 's deadlines are n't until the weekend , and the magazine wo n't arrive at subscribers ' homes until a week after the event , so @entity5 figures it 's unlikely this gig has cover potential			1
and with @entity203 such a compelling story , too , he 's not sure that he 'll even get one image in the magazine			2
celebration photos always play well , but only the photographers at the bottom will have @entity27 right in front of them			0
@entity5 halfway wishes he could shoot those photos instead of @entity123			1
" we 're all basically competitive , " he says wistfully			0
" but you ca n't be both places			0
" @entity11 : photos of @entity27 's winning run @entity27 did the expected and easily won gold			1
back in the work area , @entity5 says not everything went well			2
counting practice , each rider who made the final made nine runs			0
@entity5 says he solved a problem with one of the remote cameras in time to shoot the first practice session , but at some point he accidentally hit the focus			1
" everything looked like mr. @entity230 [ took them ] , " he said			0
at least 75 percent of photography is problem solving , he said			0
( two - and - half percent of photography is skill , he joked )			0
it 's knowing where to set up , knowing your equipment and knowing how to fix that equipment when it breaks			0
but while you 're fixing things , you 're missing pictures , and it 's frustrating			2
and then there 's just plain bad luck			0
@entity5 says that during one practice run a tv cameraman ran in front of him , snapping pictures on his phone			1
but these are the things you deal with , he says			0
he 's a little down at dinner afterward because he caught a glimpse of the some of the other photographers ' pictures			2
as he had predicted , a bunch of shots with @entity27 , his face one big smile , holding the @entity262 flag			0
but later his mood changes when back at the hotel suite he logs onto the @entity11 web site			2
there is a picture , looking up the pipe of @entity27 , cast against a clear night sky , soaring through the air , on his way to a gold medal			0
as for the magazine , he 'll be waiting , just like the rest of us			2

@entity5 has been a photographer with @entity11 for 24 years
his assignment at the @entity47 : shoot events at @entity10
to prepare for shooting halfpipe , @entity5 and assistant went to several events beforehand
@entity5 took 1,400 pictures in one day , not sure if any will make the magazine
