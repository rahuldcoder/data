the former @entity13 governor said on her @entity15 page that she was too angry to offer a coherent response , so she had her daughter @entity18 release a full statement on the family 's behalf			1
the @entity22 directed their criticism at the prime - time @entity5 cartoon , " @entity26			1
" in sunday 's episode , a teenaged female character with @entity8 told another character that " my mom is the former governor of @entity13			1
" a song and dance routine by another character also used language that ridiculed people with disabilities			2
according to the show 's web site , " @entity26 " earned an emmy nomination in 2009 for @entity40 , " only the second animated series in television history to be honored with such distinction			1
" on the show , @entity6 performs the voices of the father , @entity47 , and his 1 - year - old son , @entity48 , who is , the @entity5 web site reports , " a diabolically clever baby whose heterosexuality is hanging by a thread			2
" @entity6 is also the voice of the intellectually superior family dog			2
the web site @entity57 reports that @entity6 began drawing cartoons at the age of 2 and is the recipient of two honorary degrees			2
while receiving the one from @entity62 in 2006 , he delivered the @entity63 playing the roles of several of the characters from " @entity26			1
" he also received a degree in 2007 from his alma mater , the @entity67			2
@entity68 : @entity2 slams @entity5 's ' @entity26 ' ' @entity26 ' : about the show @entity70 : the @entity74 spiritual leader is on his way to the @entity76 for a number of speaking engagements and is scheduled to meet with president @entity79 on thursday , even though @entity80 has warned that such a meeting would harm ties between it and the @entity76 , a @entity72 spokesman said on february 2			1
" the president told @entity80 's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the @entity70 , and he intends to do so , " @entity84 told reporters earlier this month			1
@entity80 warned that ties between two of the world 's superpowers would be strained if @entity79 met with the @entity70			1
" it will seriously undermine the foundation of @entity101 political relations , " said @entity93 , a @entity94 official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the @entity70			1
@entity102 accuses the @entity70 of advocating for @entity74 independence from @entity80			1
in explaining @entity79 's intention to hold the meeting , @entity84 said the @entity70 " is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader , and the president will meet with him in that capacity			1
" @entity110 is technically autonomous from the central @entity80 government , but the @entity70 and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of @entity118 , the most numerous ethnic group in @entity80			1
@entity93 said there would be no compromise on @entity80 's control of @entity110			1
the 14th @entity70 was born in july 1935			1
according to his official biography , the child named @entity124 at that time was recognized at the age of 2 as the reincarnation of the @entity129			2
he went through years of monastic training and assumed political power in 1950 , a year after @entity80 's invasion			1
the @entity70 ultimately fled @entity80 in 1959 after a failed uprising against @entity80 rule			1
he lives in exile in the north @entity137 town of @entity138			2
@entity0 : @entity72 says @entity79 will meet with @entity70 @entity0 : discord over @entity70 @entity140 : a brief biography @entity142 : the 25 - year - old from @entity144 , @entity145 , has been living for two weeks at the corner of @entity147 and @entity148 in @entity149			1
he 's been living there in a tent to show solidarity with @entity154 families in crisis , he says , and to remind people that emergency shelter is still sorely needed for victims of the january 12 earthquake			2
when @entity0 reached him by phone in his tent tuesday , he explained that he was recently in @entity149 to figure out how to work in @entity162 , but realized that the situation in @entity154 was a more pressing need			2
so he went to the @entity165 to volunteer in any way he could			2
he says a minister at the embassy came up with the official - sounding title " special assistant to the @entity165 for relief and reconstruction , " which @entity142 now uses informally			2
when he passed a nearby statue of the @entity137 political and spiritual leader @entity174 , @entity142 read the inscription , " my life is my message , " and the idea of staying in the tent came to him			2
@entity142 , who has a master 's degree in global governance and diplomacy from the @entity184 in @entity185 , says he plans to live in the tent for at least one month			2
" if i can still be effective , i 'll stay there for a year			2
" the tent is pitched in the private parking lot of a pizza restaurant with the permission of its owner			2
@entity142 told @entity0 , " the police stop by to make sure i 'm ok and not too crazy			0
" he says his parents are a bit concerned , yet somewhat relieved			0
" my initial plan was to head to @entity162 , but for my dad and mom , anything that 's not @entity162 makes them pretty happy			0
" next week , @entity142 plans to hold a news conference at his tent to announce his " @entity204 " campaign			0
he said , " it 's not about us saving @entity154			0
this crisis has the opportunity that @entity154 is going to save us from a narrow @entity76 dream -- one that does n't recognize that we are connected to people around the world			1
" live for @entity154 @entity214 aka @entity214 : just when you think someone 's 15 minutes of fame are up , politics manages to reset the clock			0
@entity214 , who gained notoriety during the last presidential campaign as " @entity214 , " spoke this past weekend in @entity222 , @entity223 , at an event on behalf of state rep. @entity225 , who is running for governor			0
@entity227 of @entity223 's @entity228 reports that @entity214 told him that more than 200 politicians wanted his support , but he 's backed only five so far			0
he 's now supporting grass - roots @entity232 movements			0
during his speech , @entity214 said he does n't support @entity2 any more because the former @entity13 governor is backing sen. @entity237 's re-election effort			1
" @entity237 is no public servant , " he told the room , calling @entity237 a career politician			0
when @entity227 pointed out that without @entity237 , he 'd just be plain old @entity241 of @entity242 -- @entity214 would n't exist -- his response was , " i do n't owe him s ---			1
he really screwed my life up , is how i look at it			0
" @entity214 told the reporter , " @entity237 was trying to use me			0
i happened to be the face of @entity249			0
" @entity214 first gained fame in 2008 when he told candidate @entity79 that he was worried that rolling back president @entity253 's tax breaks would prevent him from buying a plumbing company that would earn between $ 250,000 and $ 280,000 a year			1
@entity255 : a few minutes with @entity214 @entity256 : " you 're so vain , you probably think this song is about you / you 're so vain , i 'll bet you think this song is about you / do n't you ? do n't you ? " thirty - seven years ago , @entity261 's song was no. 1 and she had just married singer - songwriter @entity263			1
so everyone wanted to know : who is the subject of the song ? who is that vain ? all these years later , people still want to know			1
@entity261 has never revealed the answer			0
but at @entity273 , she does list some of her former boyfriends : @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278			0
@entity261 has also never made a music video of the song			1
( for purists , @entity281 did sample " @entity286 " in her 2001 music video , " @entity285			1
" ) @entity261 has just announced a contest on the web site , inviting fans and filmmakers to create a music video , using the original or new version of her song			1
she will screen all entries herself , select a winner , and meet the filmmaker -- whose winning entry will also be premiered at the 2010 @entity300			1
@entity261 says she has always been amazed by the attention given to the mystery person in the song			0
in 2004 , she gave hints to @entity0 : " well , i guess for those who are interested in clues -- the name of the person it was about had an e in it			0
" that could indicate @entity275 , @entity277 or @entity263			0
she continued , " maybe i could disclose another letter			0
ok , it also has an @entity316 " in announcing the music video contest , @entity261 does not indicate that she will ever reveal the name			1
@entity318 what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			0
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
