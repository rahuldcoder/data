the way things have gone for the @entity4 men in downhills in @entity6 this month , they probably wish every race could be held there			1
after @entity10 won one of skiing 's classics in @entity14 about a week ago , @entity9 claimed the opening victory of his career by bettering the field in @entity18 -- a venue long known on the women 's circuit but making its debut among the men			1
the course shortened due to high winds and bad visibility , @entity9 took advantage and won in a time of one minute , 32.42 seconds			1
he was 0.09 seconds faster than @entity29 's @entity28 and 0.21 seconds faster than home favorite @entity30			1
" it was a perfect run , " @entity9 told the @entity4 ski team 's website			1
" i love to take on a new challenge and a new slope			0
i love the hill -- the mountains are huge here and it 's fun skiing			2
" i went really , really straight in a couple areas			0
it was really smooth and i was able to carry it all the way down			0
the last big carousel turn i did perfectly -- i do n't think i could do that again if i tried			0
" hopefully this will keep going all year			0
my @entity48 's resolution is to do this more often			2
" @entity10 finished 15th , two spots better than @entity51 of @entity52			0
@entity51 , though , maintained his lead in both the downhill and overall standings			2
first win for @entity56 , too @entity9 was n't the lone racer to capture a maiden victory sunday , as @entity60 's @entity59 triumphed in a women 's giant slalom in @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity29 -- new to the @entity65 tour			1
in second heading into the final run behind @entity4 @entity67 , @entity56 attacked the course and made up the 0.27 - second deficit			2
@entity29 's @entity69 moved up to second , with @entity67 -- whose specialty is the slalom -- dropping to third			1
" it 's not easy to put words on such emotions right now , " @entity56 was quoted as saying by the @entity74 website			0
" to be on top of the podium is so special			0
" @entity69 solidified her spot in second in the overall standings behind @entity83 -- who tied for seventh sunday			0
@entity69 is also second in the giant slalom standings , trailing compatriot @entity86			1
a lack of snow in @entity89 , @entity29 , prompted the move to @entity62 in @entity63 .			2

@entity9 wins his first downhill by claiming top spot in @entity18
in a shortened run , he beat @entity29 's @entity28 by 0.09 seconds
it was the @entity4 's second downhill triumph in @entity6 in about a week
@entity60 's @entity59 also won her first race in a women 's giant slalom
