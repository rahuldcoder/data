-- as the @entity1 prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law , @entity0 spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue			1
@entity8 is executive director of @entity9 for the @entity10			1
the group , along with 26 states , will appear at the court 's oral arguments			2
@entity10 represents 350,000 small - business owners			1
( @entity16 , founding executive director of @entity17 , is for the health care reform law			1
read his viewpoint here )			2
the following interview with @entity8 is edited for clarity and brevity : @entity0 : has the @entity24 reached a health care crisis that justified the law supported by president @entity27 and most democrats in @entity29 ? @entity8 : " we strongly think that our system is broken , and @entity10 for two decades has been aggressively fighting for health insurance reforms			1
the reforms we wanted unfortunately were not included in the final law			1
they were reforms that would not drive down the cost of health insurance			1
that has been the number one issue for small - business owners			1
" we are very much not of the ' just say no ' crowd , we think the status quo is not acceptable			0
our members are very vocal on that			0
the problem is that the reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up landing on the cutting room floor and that @entity29 made a bad situation worse			1
" preview : ' the implications ... are impossible to overstate ' @entity0 : but proponents argue there are tax incentives and other benefits designed to help small businesses provide health coverage for their small staffs			1
@entity8 : " of course , there are provisions in this law that small - business owners like			1
on the big picture , our small - business owners do n't get to pick and choose which provisions of the law apply to them , in addition to the two better provisions			1
there are numerous new tax increases , but there 's also an unconstitutional infringement of individual liberty in the form of individual mandates that require everyone to buy health insurance or pay a fine			2
so at the end of the day , the small - business owners that we represent saw more bad than good			2
" the tax credit has been highlighted by the administration as something that 's great for small business , but what we have found is that most of our members are not going to get that full credit			0
and the extent to which they get that credit , it 's just not that significant			0
because the amount of the tax incentive goes down as you either add employees or pay them more			0
it 's actually disincentivizing small - business owners to grow their businesses			2
" @entity0 : why in your view is the individual mandate requiring most americans to purchase some form of health issuance an unconstitutional provision ? @entity8 : " if it 's upheld , then the @entity109 is essentially giving @entity29 the authority to create a command - and - control economy			1
this is about them telling us all sorts of things that we have to buy or contracts that we need to enter into			0
this is exactly the opposite of what we want to see -- @entity29 telling you where you need to be shopping , what you need to buy			0
two families , two viewpoints on health reform " it also is just amending decades -- maybe centuries -- of contract law because you always have two willing participants			1
those are things that fundamentally strike at the core of the small - business owners that i represent ; it offends them to no end			2
as a practical matter , there are dollars and cents attached to this			0
i 've talked to members who say , ' look , this is a no - brainer			2
' " @entity0 : so you worry the federal government would only expand its authority over commerce ? @entity8 : " the government has only made this worse in how they 've argued this case , because they 've been unable in every court they 've been in before , to say where it would end			1
" as recently as the federal @entity152 case , where @entity155 [ @entity154 ] @entity153 asked them [ the @entity158 lawyers ] point blank , ' is it unconstitutional to regulate broccoli ? ' and [ the government lawyer ] said , ' well , it depends			0
' now it 's like we 're not citizens of this country anymore , we 're merely subjects , if this individual mandate goes through			0
" @entity0 : should @entity29 start all over and craft a new health care bill ? @entity8 : " @entity10 went into this with the intention of striking down the entire law			1
we have demanded for decades that we get health insurance reform that drives down the cost of health insurance for small - business owners because that market is severely broken			1
" we also believe , as the government has continued to argue , that the individual mandate is key , integral , to its operation			0
without the individual mandate , it can not stand			0
even some of the provisions that people think are relatively extraneous come back , at least from a cost perspective , to the individual mandate			0
and if you do n't have that , how does the rest of it work ? " ... and the answer here is clearly no , because the two things that the law was said to be accomplishing were to increase coverage			2
the individual mandate is very key to increasing coverage			0
and reducing costs -- again by getting everybody into the pool , they 're basically having the young , healthy people subsidizing the older population			0
that is supposed to be helping to lower costs for all			0
" when you take that out , we do n't see how the entire law works as @entity29 intended			2
and we definitely do n't think @entity29 would have passed it without the individual mandate			0
" @entity0 : what is your message to the @entity1 as they take on this legal challenge ? @entity8 : " we think the law is on our side			1
we think it 's very clear that the @entity220 never intended to see @entity29 telling people what products they should buy			0
if you look at the justifications the government gives , the text does n't support this mandate , the @entity109 does n't support it , and if the justices rule that the individual mandate is constitutional , they are going to basically open the door for @entity29 to legislate whatever mandates it finds appropriate that it will impose on individuals			0
" we think the law , the @entity109 , is very much on our side			1
that 's what they 're charged with upholding			0

@entity8 speaks for the @entity10
@entity8 : reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up being cut
if health law is upheld , it will " create a command - and - control economy , " she says
her *assessment* of having reform struck down : " we think the law is on our side "
