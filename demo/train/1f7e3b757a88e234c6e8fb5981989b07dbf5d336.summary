-- after days of intense backlash from users over changes to its terms of service and privacy policy , photo - sharing service @entity1 has backtracked			1
on thursday , @entity1 co-founder @entity9 said the company was switching one section of its updated terms of service back to its original text			2
" because of the feedback we have heard from you , we are reverting this advertising section to the original version that has been in effect since we launched the service in october 2010 , " said @entity9 in a post announcing the change			1
on monday , the @entity23 - owned app updated its terms of service to say companies could pay @entity1 to use members ' images in ads without compensating the photographers			2
@entity1 claimed the update was to allow the company to experiment with possible future advertising options , and was not part of any current plan to sell images			2
" going forward , rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed , we are going to take the time to complete our plans , and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work , " @entity9 said in thursday 's post			0
opinion : instagram users should wise up it is not a complete reversal			0
many of the other changes to the terms of service and privacy policy remain			1
the company still needs to work on ways to integrate ads into its free service , but for now it will tinker behind the scenes instead of prematurely sending users into a panic over the possibility that their likeness could show up in advertisements on the network			0
the old advertising section that has been reinstated still says the company can place ads on the service and that " the manner , mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you , " leaving the company with some wiggle room for future changes			0
this announcement comes two days after another mea culpa post by @entity79 , in which he apologized for the confusion and reassured @entity1 users that they still owned their images and that the company was hearing the feedback loud and clear			0
the severity of users ' reactions to the change seemed to catch @entity1 off guard , though the cycle of a policy change announcement followed by user backlash and then an apology is familiar territory for its parent company , @entity23 .			1
