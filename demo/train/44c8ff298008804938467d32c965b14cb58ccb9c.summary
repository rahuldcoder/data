-- can your credit card buy you a second - hand memory ? is it possible to purchase the warmth of recollection in a cash transaction ? apparently a lot of people think so			1
according to @entity12 of the @entity13 , former @entity11 @entity10 recently decided he would endeavor to sell the bat he swung and the ball he hit to win the 1976 @entity16			0
and @entity18 , captain of the 1980 " do you believe in miracles ? " @entity23 @entity22 hockey team , decided to find out how much the uniform he wore in the defeat of the @entity28 team would bring			0
he found out , all right : $ 657,250			0
there seems to be a growth market in the items found in the closets and storage lockers of retired big - name athletes			1
for many of them , it makes perfect sense to cash in on the old uniforms , gloves , balls , bats , gym shoes and cleats			1
the allure of all that scuffed and fraying stuff shines brighter to strangers , and the athletes , as the years pass , have families with their own financial needs			2
but three names in @entity12 's story jumped out , because each of the three athletes proved to me , a long time ago , that the finest memories are free			1
@entity58 , the second baseman for the @entity59 who won the @entity60 against the @entity11 in 1960 with a thrilling home run , is selling his old gear at an auction next month			0
the family of the late golfer @entity65 sold the claret jug he won at the 1946 @entity67 for $ 262,900			0
@entity68 , the great guard for the @entity69 , sold just about all the uniforms and memorabilia in his basement for around $ 320,000 , which he gave to his two daughters : " that was a much greater priority than hanging on to it			1
" maybe the people forking over their money for the sweat - stained clothes will find a lasting connection through their ownership			1
yet as soon as i saw @entity58 's name , i thought about a long - ago afternoon when he gave a buddy and me something beyond price : his time			1
when my best friend @entity89 and i were 12 years old and crazy about sports , we hatched a plan			2
any time there was a big sports awards dinner in our @entity95 town -- one of those events that would bring in famous athletes as draws -- we would meet at one of our houses and go to two separate telephones			1
we 'd call the hotel where we knew the event was being held , and we 'd lower our voices a few octaves and ask for the room of the sports star we dreamed of talking to			2
sometimes it worked ; sometimes it did n't			0
and sometimes , even when we got through , the athlete would decline to talk with us			0
we even loved those moments -- at least we 'd been able to briefly hear the voice of the famous quarterback or center fielder , even if all he was saying was " no. " when an athlete would agree to talk with us , though -- we said we wanted to do a sports interview , but were a bit vague in specifying that our only outlet was a little self - produced mimeographed newspaper -- it was something we sensed , even at the time , that we would never forget			1
@entity89 died nine years ago , and in his final months we reminisced about those afternoons , and about our gratitude for the athletes who had given us those memories			1
@entity58 and @entity65 were two of them who were the most generous with us ; sure , they may have just been killing time in the hours before they had to go down to the banquet room , but they shared a little of that time with us			2
we did n't own a tape recorder -- @entity89 would hold one receiver of those big old rotary - dial phones , and i would do the same on another extension in the house , and we would trade off questions and take notes -- and i 'm glad that we did n't have tapes , because if we had , the tapes might have replaced the memories , the tapes might have become cold stand - ins			1
( i do n't need a tape to recall , with a smile , what one celebrated ballplayer told us after we asked him our standard final wrap - up question : " what is your advice for young athletes ? " his reply : " keep them grades up			2
" ) and @entity68 ? he never came to our town , as far as i knew			0
but some of us , as kids , would , just about every day , send an envelope to one famous professional athlete or another in big - league cities			1
inside each envelope was a pre-stamped , self - addressed postcard			2
we would hope that , before or after a game , the athlete , opening his fan mail in the locker room , would see our postcard , sign his name on it and drop it in a mailbox			0
it was like playing the lottery			0
one day , when the mail carrier arrived at my parents ' home , there it was : the postcard i had sent to @entity68 in care of the far - off @entity183 , now bearing his signature , with a personal inscription to me above it			0
it was just such a great day			0
decades later , when i would get to know @entity68 , and i would run into him from time to time , i would always remind him of that story , and would always thank him anew			0
being a gracious man , he would smile and say it was nothing			0
i hope that the people who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in pursuit of memories of their sports heroes will feel that they got their money 's worth			1
but the best memories in life , the most enduring , are nontransferable , and never for sale			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

big - name athletes are cashing in on old uniforms and balls to the tune of a lot of money
@entity206 : is it possible to buy the warmth of recollection in a cash transaction ?
he recalls some of his sports heroes who gave him something beyond price : their time
@entity206 : the best memories in life , the most enduring , are nontransferable , never for sale
