-- over the extended 4th of july weekend , a lot of @entity2 lit up the grill and spent time with family			0
a lot unfolded lawn chairs and watched a fireworks show			0
and a whole lot bought tickets to see @entity10			2
the $ 76 million animated film from @entity12 and @entity13 crushed the competition in its first five days in theaters , earning a jaw - dropping $ 142 million — $ 82.5 million of which came in during the traditional friday - to - sunday frame			1
in fact , @entity10 , which features the voice work of @entity20 and @entity21 , led the box office to the best july 4th weekend of all time			2
over the friday - to - sunday period , the top 12 movies grossed $ 220.7 million , which marks the 10th - strongest weekend in box office history			2
@entity10 's $ 82.5 million start just barely beat @entity29 's $ 82.4 million debut ( though that film opened on a friday , not a wednesday ) , and its $ 142.5 million start stands as the best ever five - day opening for an animated film ahead of @entity34 's $ 128.9 million haul in may 2004			1
like that film , @entity10 earned an " a " cinemascore grade from audiences			2
@entity12 reports that crowds were 60 - percent female and 55 - percent below the age of 25 — the studio adds that 27 percent of viewers were @entity43			0
" we knew it was going to be hugely successful , " admits @entity44 , @entity12 's president of distribution , who says family business was " phenomenal " and made up " the bulk of business " she also points to the film 's prime summer release date and the fact that families were together for the july 4th holiday as contributing factors			0
internationally , @entity10 topped the box office in 36 of the 38 countries it played in this weekend and has earned $ 151.1 million overseas , which brings its very early worldwide total to $ 293.2 million			1
notably , only 27 percent of @entity10 's domestic weekend gross came from @entity63 ticket sales — a low for the format			1
still , that does n't take away from the sensibly budgeted film 's incredible success			0
at this point , it 's already a lock for $ 300 million			2
it was a very different story for @entity73 's $ 225 million western @entity72 , which only lassoed a dismal $ 48.9 million — $ 29.4 million of which poured in during the friday - to - sunday period			1
the film , which stars @entity76 and @entity77 , joins @entity78 and @entity79 and @entity80 as films that attempted ( unsuccessfully ) to turn the western genre into widely - appealing , popcorn - munching spectacles			1
for director @entity85 and @entity76 , who previously collaborated on the ultra-successful @entity87 films , the terrible opening is particularly distressing			2
@entity76 's last two films , @entity89 and @entity90 , also severely under - performed			1
the reality is , though , that westerns have always been a tough sell at the box office			0
the highest grossing western of all time , @entity95 , earned $ 184.2 million in 1990			0
@entity72 's budget ( which does not include substantial marketing and distribution costs ) , was a full $ 41 million more than that — so the bar for success was set incredibly high			1
and the financial setback for @entity73 will likely be incredibly high as well			0
" obviously you 're always hoping that your movies are going to connect with the broadest audience possible , " says @entity104 , @entity73 's president of distribution , " so when it does n't , it 's disappointing			0
" the exec acknowledges that young people were largely unfamiliar with the 80 - year - old character of the @entity72 , as evidenced by the fact that audiences were 68 percent above the age of 25			2
those crowds issued the film a fair " @entity120			0
in third , @entity123 's $ 43 million buddy - cop comedy @entity121 fell 36 percent in its second weekend to $ 25 million , giving the @entity127 / @entity126 title a strong $ 86.4 million after ten days			1
fourth place belonged to @entity29 , which took a whopping 57 percent hit due to the arrival of @entity10			1
still , the film grossed $ 19.6 million this weekend , which gives it $ 216.1 million total and makes it the 11th @entity135 film ( out of 14 ) to surpass the $ 200 million mark domestically			0
@entity137 , @entity29 , which likely cost about $ 200 million to produce , reached the $ 400 million milestone			1
@entity139 rounded out the @entity140 , dipping 39 percent to $ 18.2 million			0
the @entity142 zombie thriller has now earned $ 158.8 million after three weekends and could reach $ 190 million total — the same amount that @entity146 says @entity139 cost to make			0
@entity10 -- $ 82.5 million 2			1
@entity72 -- $ 48.9 million 3			1
the @entity121 -- $ 25 million 4			0
@entity29 -- $ 19.6 million 5			1
@entity139 -- $ 18.2 million in eighth place , @entity150 's comedy @entity148 : let me explain grossed a remarkable $ 17.5 million from just 786 theaters over its first five days			2
of that , $ 10.1 million came in over the three - day period , which is even more impressive given the film 's teensy $ 2.5 million budget			1
@entity150 targeted @entity160 - @entity2 viewers for @entity161 , the same demographic that pushed @entity148 's breakout film , @entity163 , to a $ 7.7 million gross in 2011			1
