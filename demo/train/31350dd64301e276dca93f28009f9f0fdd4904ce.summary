-- it 's no easy matter becoming a world class tennis player			1
it 's even harder when everyone ( really -- everyone ) is calling you the " new @entity7 "			2
no pressure then on the 17 - year - old @entity10 tennis prodigy @entity9			1
" @entity9 is the best junior player in the world and i think that shows that she has a great potential , " said @entity7 ' mother @entity11 , who has been working with @entity9 for over a decade			1
" the number one junior player usually develops into a good senior player as well			0
as for @entity9 it 's all up to her and what she makes of it			1
" she certainly has good basics , she 's very versatile and therefore i think she has good chances			0
" but the road to greatness is paved with many pitfalls as @entity9 discovers two hours into her deadlocked @entity27 semifinal clash against a faultless @entity28 earlier this month			1
after missing a relatively easy winner , the @entity10 teenager slashes her racket toward the crowd and screams into the floor , yanking her pink cap down toward her eyes			2
if she really wants to be the new hingis , she 'll need to keep it together			0
a big year weeks before , as @entity9 sits courtside at the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 -- the training facility that she and her family have made their winter home -- she cuts an entirely different figure			1
beaming a smile in the @entity46 sun , @entity9 reflects on a year that started as she exploded out of tennis ' youth divisions by taking the junior crowns at @entity56 and the @entity57 -- before rising to become world junior no. 1			1
arriving at january 's @entity60 unseeded , she fought through three qualifying rounds , and broke 43 - year - old @entity62 10 times on the way to an impressive first - round win			1
faced , next , with @entity67 star @entity66 -- and her first chance to shock the tennis world -- @entity9 kept a steady head , insisting she " did n't have much to lose			1
" after being blitzed 6 - 0 in a 20 - minute first set in the @entity73 arena , the then 16 - year - old challenger almost seemed to be enjoying herself			1
she put up a gritty fight in the second -- which went to a tie - breaker -- before her defeat to the eventual champion : " i could go out there and play my best and the pressure was all on her			2
it 's not easy to play a younger player , " @entity9 , who is now the youngest player in the top 100 , told @entity0 's @entity84			1
" the first set was a lesson but ... the second set i relaxed a little bit more and i gave her a fight			0
" like @entity7 ? if @entity9 was n't born to be a tennis star , it was n't long before she set about making herself one : " i started walking on the tennis court , so my first steps were on the tennis court , " she says			2
" and a few moments later , i tried to play and i had fun			0
" as a child , her walls were lined with posters of compatriots @entity102 -- her mother is his biggest fan , she says , so the two watch all his matches together -- and , of course , her idol @entity7			0
by the time she started racking up wins in junior competitions , the comparisons with the former world no. 1 -- who won three of her five grand slam singles titles before turning 17 -- were inevitable			1
in addition to the inevitable -- being a hard - nosed @entity10 - born star , to @entity119 © parents from the former @entity120 -- from the age of four she was coached by @entity11 , who imparted her with a certain familiar style			1
" you can see by the hands , and you can see how she takes the ball on the rise , " 18 - time grand slam champion @entity124 tells @entity84 at her exclusive academy , referring to the similarities between @entity7 and @entity9			1
" and how she improvises and how she comes up with touch shots when she needs them			0
" @entity11 concurs : " their technique is very similar , " before adding the proviso : " however , it 's been 17 years and the style of tennis has changed			2
" mental strength @entity124 is adamanat she saw @entity9 's " x-factor " as soon as she arrived			2
" she 's very focused mentally , emotionally very composed and i just thought : ' she has it			0
' " while many young players are singled out by technique -- the ability to strike a killer serve or critical backhand -- @entity9 is one of the very few already applauded as a tactician			2
" i think it 's true i 'm not the biggest power player but i am trying to think on the court and ( have ) a good tactic against opponents , " said the world no. 91			1
@entity11 also cites the relentless preparation that modern sport now demands -- and @entity9 's willingness to accept the sacrifices that need to be made in the pursuit of greatness			1
" i think a lot of it has to do with me and the training i put her through , " said @entity11			0
" we 've put much emphasis on discipline and versatility			0
i think it makes a big difference that she is versatile and can rely on all these shots on the court			0
" ever the perfectionist though , @entity11 cautions : " however , she still has to work a lot on her serve			0
" @entity124 and @entity9 agree that behind her mature composure and mental strength lies a close - knit and supportive family			2
@entity9 's father @entity181 is now her full - time coach , while her brother fills in as hitting partner			1
after each match , that maturity becomes clear			0
from the hard - fought win against date - @entity62 , to the gutsy defeat by @entity66 , @entity9 undergoes a remarkable post-match transformation , from steely , ruthless competitor to gracious student -- thanking her opponent for a tough lesson , and vowing to put it into action in the next match			1
coping with expectations back at the @entity27 , @entity9 is forced to admit defeat			0
after more than two and a half hours on court , grappling an opponent with more than double the matches she has on the circuit -- who has twisted her and turned her with a ruthless display of her own -- @entity9 smiles			2
she is the first female qualifier to reach the semifinals and the youngest finalist since ( who else ? ) @entity7 -- but will go no further			0
but for " the new @entity7 , " there 's no rush to match the expectations that come with the title			0
just a composed desire to take it to the next level			0
" my goal is to improve every day , to get as far as i can , be the best that i can , and just to look step - by - step			0
i do n't want to set any goals -- it 's extra pressure -- and i will just play			0

@entity9 is the youngest women 's player in the world 's top 100
the 17 - year - old @entity10 has exploded onto the @entity225 in 2014
at this month 's @entity228 , she stunned two top - 10 seeds
world no. 2 @entity66 -- and many others -- have *dubbed* her " the new hingis "
