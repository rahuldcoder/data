@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 state panel on wednesday denied parole for @entity5 , saying the convicted assassin of @entity7 has n't demonstrated an understanding of the " magnitude " of his crimes			1
commissioner @entity11 of the @entity12 told @entity5 that he failed to meet the state 's criteria for suitability for parole and added that he failed to seek self - help program and his behavoir was immature			1
in response , @entity5 sought to interrupt @entity11 , who admonished the inmate			1
@entity11 , however , said @entity5 would be eligible for parole again in five years			1
" at this hearing , you 're interrupting me time and time again , demonstrating a lack of control and impulsitivity , " @entity11 told @entity5			1
@entity5 made his first appearance before a @entity1 parole board since 2000 , supported by two psychologists ' reports saying he no longer poses a threat to society , his attorney said			1
" while @entity5 's statements at his parole hearing will likely be the source of continuing public interest due to the infamous nature of the crime , there is little he can say that is likely to sway the parole board and convince them that he deserves to be released from prison , " said @entity34 , a former federal prosecutor			1
@entity46 , who shared with @entity2 his prepared statement to the parole board , said he was hit by a stray bullet in the abdomen " on that terrible evening " a quarter past midnight on june 5 , 1968 , after @entity7 had just won the @entity1 primary in his bid for the @entity54 presidential nomination			1
now 73 , @entity46 , of @entity55 , @entity1 , was an @entity56 associate director at the time of the shooting			0
" i 'm advised that two reputable psychologists , one representing the state of @entity1 and the other from @entity62 , have concluded , after examining him -- @entity5 -- that if he is granted parole , he would not be a threat to himself and others , and the community at large			1
if this is a fact and the board is inclined to grant him parole after him being in prison for nearly 43 years , i would not be opposed to the decision , " @entity46 said in a telephone interview with @entity2			1
@entity74 declined to comment on @entity46 's statement or on the psychologists ' reports to the parole board , but he said @entity46 's scheduled appearance would mark the first time during @entity5 's imprisonment that a surviving witness voiced no objection to his possible parole -- at least since 1970			1
prior to 1970 , " there 's no record of the proceedings and i do n't know if anyone showed up , " @entity74 said			0
" it 's fairly unusual			0
it 's not common , " @entity74 added with respect to victims attending a parole hearing and not objecting to the prisoner being released			0
" we do n't get many , at least in cases in @entity97 -- where we get victims or victims ' next of kin coming to cases			0
it 's an expensive proposition			0
" wednesday will mark @entity5 's 14th parole hearing			1
it 's scheduled to be held in the @entity106 in @entity0 , @entity1 , which is 200 miles northwest of downtown @entity97			0
members of the @entity7 family and their representatives did n't return messages or e-mails seeking a comment			1
@entity5 's attorney , @entity113 , an international human rights attorney and a barrister with offices in @entity116 and @entity117 , said he and @entity5 were " very grateful " for @entity46 's statement			1
@entity5 was convicted of killing @entity7 and wounding five other people in the shooting in the kitchen pantry of the @entity122 in @entity97			1
the hotel was later razed and a public school now occupies the site			0
he was convicted of first - degree murder and five counts of assault with attempt to commit murder			0
four of those five surviving victims are alive , including @entity46			0
the others are @entity133 , a @entity7 family friend and former @entity135 regional leader ; @entity136 , a former radio journalist ; and @entity138 , a friend of the late @entity139			2
a @entity141 who was born in @entity143 and whose parents brought him and his siblings to @entity146 in the 1950s , @entity5 killed @entity7 because of statements the @entity116 senator made about the @entity146 sending fighter jets to aid @entity150 , prosecutors argued during @entity5 's 1969 trial			1
in 1968 , senator @entity7 , who was a younger brother of assassinated president @entity152 , is whose administration he also served as attorney general , was a leading contender for the @entity54 presidential nomination against vice president @entity157 and sen. @entity158			1
@entity7 was shot only minutes after a hotel ballroom speech televised live to @entity146 household , in which he claimed victory over @entity158 in the @entity1 primary			2
the shooting , in the hotel 's kitchen pantry , was not captured by any cameras			0
@entity5 was the only person arrested in the shooting			2
@entity5 has @entity170 citizenship but never became a @entity146 citizen , so if the parole board were to release him , he would be deemed an illegal immigrant and deported to @entity170 , where he has extended family , his attorney said			1
@entity5 's younger brother , @entity176 , 63 , continues to live in the southern @entity1 community where the @entity5 family siblings were raised , @entity175 said			2
@entity5 " has maintained a good relationship with his brother and he would love to live with this brother in @entity182 , but that 's very unlikely because of his immigration status , " @entity113 said			2
@entity185 , an associate clinical professor in psychology at @entity187 , has submitted a statement to the parole board after interviewing @entity5 for 60 hours over a three - year period , @entity113 said			1
" the report is part of a sealed file , but i can say that @entity5 does not have any violent tendency that should be regarded as a threat to the community , " @entity113 said			1
@entity185 's report " confirms @entity5 's legitimacy of the loss of his memory , " including in the pantry during the shooting and in moments of his life in the year prior to the @entity7 slaying , @entity113 said			1
" @entity5 has at various times taken responsibility ( for the @entity7 assassination ) , but the actual fact is that he does n't remember what happened in the pantry at all			1
but because everyone around there told him he did it and he had a pistol and he did fire that pistol , he came to believe that he was actually guilty , " @entity113 said			0
@entity5 shows no sign of mental illness and has demonstrated remorse for the shootings , @entity113 said			2
@entity5 has been " free of any disciplinary rulings against him " in prison , @entity113 said			2
" he 's said no day of his life goes by where he does n't have remorse and deep regret that this took place and the role he played in this thing , " @entity113 said			0
" he 's not schizophrenic or psychotic , and he has not shown any history of violence during incarceration			0
" @entity113 said he became @entity5 's pro bono attorney in the fall of 2007 after he learned of the results of an audio analysis conducted on a sound track of the @entity7 shooting			1
the audio recording , made 40 feet away from the crime scene by free - lance newspaper reporter @entity244 , is the only known recording of the gunshots in that june 1968 assassination			0
@entity113 said he believes the @entity244 recording is evidence showing that there was a second gun firing in addition to @entity5 's @entity254 handgun			2
the tape was uncovered in 2004 by @entity2 's @entity256 , who had the recording independently examined by two audio analysts , @entity259 in @entity260 , @entity261 , and @entity262 in @entity263 , @entity264			0
@entity256 reported on their separate findings for @entity2 's backstory in june 2009			0
but the parole board wo n't hear arguments on the second - gun evidence , @entity113 said			0
rather , the parole panel will focus on @entity5 's suitability for parole , he said			1
the @entity244 recording " clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry , and @entity5 's gun had only eight shots , so it definitely means there was a second shooter , " @entity113 said			2
but @entity46 , joined by authorities who have dismissed the second - gun assertion , said he was convinced that @entity5 was a lone gunman			2
" i 've seen so many theories after 43 years			0
please -- i think you can have a conspiracy in a dictatorship and some countries , but i do n't think so in a democracy or our country where there is freedom of speech , " @entity46 said			0
however , another shooting victim sees it differently than @entity295 : @entity133			0
he is a @entity7 friend who was shot in the forehead while standing immediately behind @entity7 in the pantry			2
in 2008 , @entity133 , now 86 , told @entity2 that he believes evidence clearly shows @entity5 was not the only person who fired shots in that assassination			2
" we have proof that the second shooter was behind us and off to our right			0
@entity5 was off to the left and in front of us , " @entity133 told @entity2 anchor @entity305			2
@entity133 declined to comment to @entity2 this week about wednesday 's scheduled parole hearing for @entity5			1
in a 2006 interview on @entity2 's @entity310 , @entity46 recounted how @entity7 and he were shot			2
" well , i was right behind @entity311			0
we were following him to go downstairs and speak to another group of people			0
and i was going with our cameraman down to show him where to plug in			0
and so we followed @entity311 , and the shooting started , " @entity46 said			0
he said after @entity7 was struck three times , he was shot once in the stomach			2
@entity74 , the deputy district attorney , said @entity5 was n't present at his last two parole hearings , in 2003 and 2006 , which @entity74 attended			1
@entity113 said he was chairman of @entity7 's citizens campaign in @entity322 , @entity116 , during his successful 1964 bid for the @entity324 , and @entity113 's duties included taking @entity7 's sisters and mother to political events			0
he said he was also a volunteer in the successful 1960 presidential campaign of @entity7 's brother , @entity152			0
in 1999 , @entity113 represented the rev. dr. @entity331 's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning @entity331 's april 4 , 1968 , murder and successfully persuaded a @entity335 , jury to find @entity336 responsible as an accomplice in the @entity331 assassination			0
if @entity5 is denied parole , @entity113 said he would consider appealing the matter to the courts			1
@entity5 was initially sentenced to death , but three years later that sentence was commuted by @entity1 courts to life imprisonment plus six months to 14 years in prison , to run concurrently .			1

@entity5 will not be eligible for parole again for five years
two psychologists ' reports say @entity5 poses no threat to society , his attorney says
@entity5 , *66* , is serving a life sentence for the 1968 slaying of @entity7
