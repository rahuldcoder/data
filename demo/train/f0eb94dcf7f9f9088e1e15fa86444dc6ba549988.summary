-- it 's a thrill for me as a fisherman to see a wild @entity5 silver salmon jump out of the water with my fly in his mouth			1
and it 's an even greater thrill for me as a father to see my eldest son guide his old man and his little brother into a honey hole full of salmon on a remote @entity5 river			1
i experienced both of those thrills this summer , as you can see from the mile - wide grin on my face in this picture			0
for three generations my family has come to @entity5 to chase wild salmon			1
the @entity26 , the @entity27 , the @entity28 , the @entity29 and the @entity30 are graceful , powerful beauties with an unerring gps for home			0
they 're also tasty -- and among the healthiest sources of protein you can find			0
wild salmon ( the ultimate free - range meat ) is high in healthful @entity40 fatty acids , and has been found to prevent heart disease and diabetes in native alaskans -- even those who are obese			1
no wonder @entity45 have been happily harvesting salmon for at least 40 centuries			2
of course , humans are n't the only species who know the joy of salmon			2
i have had the humble honor of sharing an @entity5 stream with a bevy of @entity58			1
without my expensive waders or flyrod , lacking even polarized sunglasses , they out - fish me every time			0
i have seen eagles -- mammoth golden eagles and majestic bald eagles , dive - bomb rivers to pick off smaller salmon , and choruses of cacophonous sea gulls scavenge salmon carcasses on a riverbank			2
and i caught the biggest rainbow trout of my life in @entity5 , where the species thrives on salmon eggs			1
@entity76 is the focal point of so much of the economy in @entity5 and the @entity79			1
@entity76 contribute $ 1.5 billion annually and 14,000 jobs to the region 's economy			2
for good reason , the @entity26 is the state fish of @entity5			1
and yet this magnificent , abundant , nutritious , valuable resource is threatened			2
a partnership between two companies -- @entity89 - based @entity88 , which has a spotty environmental record and @entity92 - based @entity91 -- wants to build one of the world 's largest mines to extract copper , gold and molybdenum at the headwaters of two of the most significant rivers in @entity102			1
@entity88 says it is committed to a goal of minimizing " any impact to the local environment by designing , operating and closing all of our operations in an environmentally responsible manner			0
" but the mammoth @entity111 would , according to an exhaustive review conducted by the @entity110 , destroy up to 90 miles of streams and as much as nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands right smack - dab in the middle of one of the largest , most productive and most valuable sockeye fisheries on earth			1
the @entity118 and @entity119 have looked at this proposal as well			2
the destruction they foresee is biblical : up to 10.8 billion tons of rock waste			0
if you were to load all that waste onto train cars , the train would stretch to the moon ... five times			0
the mine would require 9 miles of dams , some of them taller than the @entity134			0
@entity135 forbid one of them failed in earthquake - prone @entity5			2
" the problem with @entity111 is its size , type and location , " said @entity139 of @entity119			0
@entity144 notes that the mine would be far bigger than all the other mines in @entity5 combined , digging down nearly a mile into the earth straddling the two major drainages of @entity102 , the @entity149 and @entity150 , two of the world 's greatest producers of sockeye and chinook salmon			1
the ore body itself contains a huge amount of acid - generating waste rock			0
" imagine a lake of dilute sulfuric acid , " he says , making my skin crawl			0
" a sulfuric lake that must be contained and monitored essentially forever			0
and this would be happening in one of the more seismically active places anywhere			0
it 's the last place to mine not the first			0
" to be sure , there are other voices in the debate			0
the @entity175 editorial board , has hypothesized that the mining companies " can , for example , build extremely high and strong tailings dams , engineering the whole project beyond what standard industry practices would dictate			0
" and the @entity183 @entity182 , the powerful lobby for big business , has mocked the @entity110 's dire warning , saying the agency has let its imagination run wild			1
still , a clear majority of @entity5 said they opposed @entity111 in a poll sponsored by the @entity192 , which represents more than 9,000 @entity193 , @entity194 , and @entity195 with ancestral ties to @entity102			1
perhaps @entity5 see this as a situation in which a handful of business people with un-calloused hands and expensive suits get the gold mine , but @entity5 get the shaft			1
all so some corporate consortium can sell more copper and gold to the @entity208			2
fortunately , under the @entity209 , the @entity110 has the authority to stop the devastation before it 's too late			1
all they have to do is use it			0
under the @entity209 , the @entity110 can block the mine if it would have an " unacceptable adverse impact " on ( among other things ) " fishery areas ( including spawning and breeding areas ) , wildlife or recreational areas			1
" @entity110 should use the power @entity224 gave it to protect @entity102			1
just as @entity227 is remembered for saving @entity228 , president @entity229 and his new epa administrator @entity226 can go down in history as the visionary leaders who saved the salmon			0
even if you have never heard a fishing reel sing as line is stripped out by a wild salmon ; even if you 've never heard your child scream " fish on ! " ; if you 've never felt the pull of a fighting fish or even tasted succulent fresh @entity5 salmon , you have a stake in stopping @entity111			1
an environmental stake , an economic stake , a moral stake			0
years ago my father shook his head and grinned as i stood in chest - deep water in 39 - degree weather and caught my first @entity5 salmon on a fly in the driving rain			1
this summer it was my turn for my heart to swell with parental pride as my sons out - fished me in @entity5			2
so i feel a special obligation to ensure that magnificent habitat is around for their children and grandchildren and on and on for another 4,000 years			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			2

@entity266 says @entity5 boasts a *pristine* salmon fishing region
he says @entity102 is threatened by proposal to build big mine for copper , gold
@entity266 says @entity110 found it would threaten streams and wetlands
he urges @entity110 to use its authority to block the plan for the mine
