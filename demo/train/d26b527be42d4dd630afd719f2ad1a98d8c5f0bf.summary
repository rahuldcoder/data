-- i met @entity2 in the late 1990s			1
i was at @entity3 conducting a workshop with coaches on sexual violence			1
it was a few years after my retirement from professional football and a decade removed from my days at @entity10 , where i competed against @entity2 's defense on the playing field			1
i had great respect for @entity2 as a coach and remember his masterful game plan in the 1986 national championship , when @entity3 defeated @entity17 with its impeccable strategy , devised by the architect of " @entity20 " i spoke with @entity2 and found he was not a typical defensive coach			1
he was pleasant and passionate about his charity , @entity23 , and the work it did to help young men find their way			2
if the allegations that @entity2 sexually abused young boys are true , it would defy the common misperception that pedophiles are monstrous misfits			1
but it would fit in with the true profile			1
when i began working in the field of sexual and domestic violence prevention in 1995 , i was stunned to find that more than 80 % of rape survivors know the men who attack them			0
the vast majority of sexual predators rely on an insidiously derived trust that not only provides access to their victims , but works to maintain their anonymity even in the light of day			0
they often stand on a broader , established reputation and use threats and gifts to maintain their victims ' silence			1
when i served on the board of @entity56 now , which is focused on the prevention of sexual abuse of children , i learned that more than 90 % of abused children know their attacker			0
once again , this defies our misguided belief that predators are like lions in the tall grass waiting to attack			0
the overwhelming reality is that they are individuals who manipulate trust and positions of power to gain access to their victims and control them			1
it is this reality that has led to such terms as " intimate partner violence " and " interpersonal violence " and " acquaintance rape			0
" trust , access and familiarity are the tools of sustained abuse			0
it is important to note that , in most cases , men are the abusers			0
this is essential in developing prevention strategies that are grounded in an accurate assessment of who commits the crimes			0
ignoring the gender of the abusers fits in with our broad view that sexual predators are " monsters , " or social deviants living in shadows			0
we think of men as the sturdy keepers of social status and power , and the standard bearers of a decent society that plays by the rules			0
@entity2 established a level of trust with his charity work consistent with the commitment he showed for the institutions he represented for most of his life			1
as a football coach at @entity3 , @entity2 was the epitome of its image and reputation			1
the program under @entity119 is considered one of the cleanest in college football , boasting high graduation rates and on - field performance			0
the image , right down to the @entity126 uniform , has been conservative and upstanding			0
as a prominent coach in that system , @entity2 was a central figure			1
it 's not hard to understand why many around him might have a vested interest in maintaining that perception			1
@entity3 stood above in the hypercompetitive and often unscrupulous world of college sports , and this served as a recruiting tool and an assurance to parents of promising high school football players			1
it 's also not hard to understand why parents of troubled young men would want their sons to have the influence of the environment that @entity3 and @entity2 provided			1
it would be convenient to consider a child abuser a " monster			0
" it would be convenient to call the alleged coverup a " mistake " by a couple of college administrators who sought to protect their institutional reputation			2
that talk has already begun , in part because we do n't want to look at the issue of child sexual abuse or abandon the beliefs we hold , including and especially our faith in sports			2
but that faith and trust is waning			0
in an attempt to preserve a storied reputation , @entity119 has called on all " @entity168 to trust what that ( institution ) stands for			2
" if these charges are true , that same veil of trust might have allowed a child sexual predator to go undetected			2
the world of sports contains many good men			2
but there is also a culture of silence upon which the myth of men thrives			0
we often speak of sports in terms of courage and integrity			2
those altruistic qualities must transcend the field and be brought to bear for the protection of our children			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

@entity194 met @entity2 at @entity3 , had great respect for him
he says if it 's true @entity2 raped boys , it would fit profile of a pedophile
pedophiles are not monstrous misfits , he says , they are often *pillars* of *community*
@entity3 had a lot to gain by upholding a clean sports reputation , he *writes*
