-- he is merciless toward opponents , secretive to the point of being a recluse and a true believer in the cause of global jihad			2
and from his hideout somewhere in southern @entity11 , @entity8 , the emir of @entity9 , has planned numerous terror attacks , including the deadliest in @entity13 since the @entity16 @entity15 bombing in 1998			1
@entity8 , who is also known as @entity17 , already has a price on his head			2
in 2012 , the @entity20 authorized a reward of up to $ 7 million for information on his whereabouts			0
but he has 15 years on his terror resume , and according to information provided by a well - placed source in @entity29 who has extensive knowledge of @entity9 , he " is ruthlessly eliminating real and imagined rivals " within the group			1
@entity16 manned and unmanned aircraft set out on monday to end his campaign of terror , though the fate of @entity8 or a deputy , @entity38 , was still unclear a day later			2
@entity16 attacks @entity9 leader in @entity11 @entity41 spokesman rear adm. @entity40 said the attack was directed at the @entity9 leader and that " we certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at			1
" but he did n't say who , if anyone , died in the attack			0
@entity8 's vision has been to transform @entity9 from an insurgent outfit focused on @entity11 into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond @entity11			1
he has already directed at least two : suicide bombings against bars in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 2010 , and last year 's @entity57 siege in @entity58 , @entity13			0
after the @entity55 attacks , which killed more than 70 people , @entity8 warned : " what happened in @entity54 was just the beginning			2
" one key suspect in the @entity54 attacks , known as @entity65 , allegedly was an explosives instructor and answered directly to @entity8			2
@entity65 is known to have visited @entity55 at least four times before the july 2010 attack			0
the source in @entity29 told @entity0 last year : " @entity8 is creating @entity9 2.0			1
" for @entity8 , the struggle has always been a global confrontation with " disbelievers " rather than just about @entity11			1
he also vowed that his group would launch a direct attack against the @entity16			0
@entity8 is 37 , according to most accounts , and originally from @entity76 , now a vaguely autonomous part of northern @entity11			1
he is slim to the point of wispy , as shown in the few photographs of him , and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public			0
as a teenager , he studied at a @entity85 madrasa , thanks to a grant from a wealthy @entity88 , and he returned home with militant beliefs			0
he was thought to have been involved in the abduction and killings of foreign aid workers in @entity76 , including the death of @entity96 aid worker @entity95 in 2003			0
among his close associates in @entity9 's early days was @entity98 , a towering force in the group and a ruthless and mercurial pro-al @entity102 hard - liner			1
after @entity98 's death in may 2008 in a @entity16 strike , @entity8 asserted his leadership of @entity9 and immediately pledged allegiance to @entity108			1
according to a @entity16 diplomatic cable published by @entity110 in 2009 , he once refused to discuss a military offensive against government forces in @entity29 with @entity9 's allies until one of them apologized for remarks he had made critical of @entity108			2
but @entity108 was wary of an @entity102 merger with @entity9			1
about a year before his death , he wrote to @entity117 that enemies would " escalate their anger and mobilize against you			0
this is what happened to the brothers in @entity125 or @entity126			0
" @entity108 's deputy at that time , @entity127 , took a different view			0
a letter dated december 2010 , which was recovered from @entity108 's compound in @entity131 , @entity85 , and was thought by researchers to have been written by @entity127 , was critical of @entity108 's decision to rebuff entreaties by the @entity11 militant group			1
" i see it to be very essential for @entity102 to confirm and declare its linkage with its branches			0
... please reconsider your opinion not to declare the accession of the brothers of @entity11 , " the author wrote			0
in february 2012 , @entity8 formally declared @entity9 an affiliate of @entity102 with a long message to @entity127 in which he said : " we will go with you as loyal soldiers until doom and injustice disappear from @entity151			1
" @entity8 has always rejected any negotiations with @entity11 's transitional federal government			1
according to another @entity16 diplomatic cable unearthed by @entity110 , @entity8 rejected an initiative in 2009 by @entity157 's @entity156 to mediate in @entity11 , telling him that once a true @entity151 government was established in @entity11 , he would move on to other countries , including @entity157			1
he opposes elections , saying , " the reality is that democracy is something @entity164 made unlawful , and someone else can not make it lawful			0
" as @entity9 came under greater pressure from the @entity169 force stationed in @entity29 , @entity8 turned to suicide bombings against civilians			2
in december 2009 , an @entity9 bomber killed 23 people at a university graduation ceremony in @entity29			0
some factions inside @entity9 disowned the attack , but @entity8 was unmoved			2
as a northerner , unlike other @entity9 commanders , he did not belong to a clan in the areas controlled by the group and was therefore less concerned about civilian casualties			2
according to a confidential @entity184 assessment , @entity8 demanded more suicide attacks to supplement conventional fighting			2
at least two such suicide attacks have come this year : a may attack on a restaurant popular with foreigners in the city of @entity192 and failed attacks on a presidential compound in @entity29			0
@entity8 's rejection of negotiations , poor management of military campaigns and the clan system soon led to dissent in @entity9			1
according to diplomatic cables in 2009 , @entity8 wanted to declare an @entity151 caliphate in areas controlled by @entity9 , which included much of central and southern @entity11			1
others in @entity9 's leadership disagreed , saying the group had to gain greater public support before such a move			2
but fearful of assassination , they kept their counsel			0
the imposition of brutal @entity213 - like law eventually alienated large sections of the population in southern and central @entity11			0
one prominent @entity9 member , the @entity16 @entity216 , said in a video in 2012 that other elements in the group were trying to kill him			2
he followed up with a series of tweets attacking @entity8			0
" @entity8 has gone mad			0
he 's starting a civil war , " he tweeted			0
@entity8 responded by ordering the killing of @entity216 , who was wounded by a gunshot in april 2013			0
his intelligence wing caught up with @entity216 months later and killed him , just days after he told the @entity228 that @entity8 had " turned @entity9 into an organization that oppresses @entity230 in an effort to win control of @entity11			1
" even longtime supporters and friends , such as @entity235 , turned against @entity8 , and paid with their lives			0
@entity237 was killed in a shootout in june 2013 in the southern town of @entity240			0
the @entity29 source told @entity0 that prominent figures in @entity9 -- including @entity243 and @entity244 -- now fear for their lives			0
@entity8 's purge accelerated during the summer of 2013 , leading @entity246 to negotiate his surrender to authorities , apparently for his own protection			1
after a @entity13 - led military operation pushed @entity9 out of population centers in 2011 , pro-al @entity102 hawks within the group gained the upper hand			1
the loss of the port city of @entity259 , the source of much of @entity9 's income , weakened arguments that the group had too much to lose by embracing @entity102 's global jihad			1
one reason @entity8 has emerged triumphant in these internal battles is that he controls @entity9 's intelligence wing , known as @entity265 , a ruthless entity organized in cells and commanded by @entity267 , also known as " karate			1
" counterterrorism analysts say that as other units in the group have been weakened , @entity8 has come to rely heavily on @entity265 , which he sees as the kernel for @entity9 's transformation into a regional @entity102 affiliate			1
@entity8 's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside @entity11 , and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to @entity102			1
after the @entity57 attack , @entity13 and @entity283 intelligence agencies stepped up efforts to end @entity8 's reign of terror , but it remains unclear if this week 's airstrike against him succeeded			1
@entity289 blog : what is @entity9 's aim in @entity13 attack ? @entity0 's @entity293 contributed to this report .			2

@entity9 chief @entity117 has a reputation for being secretive , merciless
@entity8 wants his group to be able to deliver devastating attacks beyond @entity11
he formally declared @entity9 an affiliate of @entity102
@entity8 's *tactics* have led to dissent in his group , which he has ruthlessly suppressed
