@entity0 -- at first glance , @entity3 president @entity2 enters 2014 as the country 's most powerful and popular leader in recent memory			1
a year into his expected decade - long reign , he has amassed more titles than his two immediate predecessors			0
heading not only the ruling @entity11 , the 1.5 - million strong military and the state , @entity2 also sits atop two newly created entities with ultimate authority on the most important issues facing the government : a national security council and a leadership group that decides on the course of the country 's " overall reform			1
" his star power has soared , too			0
@entity2 's recent visit to a @entity0 restaurant for some cheap steamed buns has turned the eatery into an instant shrine -- with crowds lining up to snap pictures of the table he sat on and order the so - called " presidential set			1
" even his brief @entity35 's address won admiration on social media for its human touch , when viewers noticed family photos in the background featuring his glamorous singer wife			0
with all the apparent political capital and personal charisma at his disposal , is @entity2 strong enough to launch bold reform amid slowing economic growth and rising public discontent ? in answering the question , people on opposite ends of the political spectrum are surprisingly united in their skepticism			2
flies and tigers one of @entity2 's most applauded moves since he became the @entity11 chief has been an intensified fight against corruption , a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country			1
he pledged to target " flies and tigers " alike in describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position			1
according to state media , some 108,000 officials were disciplined in the first nine months of 2013 and almost 20 minister - level senior officials have fallen from grace since late 2012			0
state media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high - flying politician @entity77 -- though called politically motivated by @entity77 supporters -- as one prime example of @entity2 's determination			1
@entity77 : from rising star to scandal @entity3 watchers have also detected signs of a possible investigation into @entity86 , the former domestic security czar and one - time patron of @entity77			2
if announced , @entity86 would be the highest - ranking official ever to face corruption charges			0
" @entity2 has made good on his word , " said @entity90 , an economics professor at @entity91 in @entity0 well known for his passionate advocacy of @entity93			2
" there is an obvious link between @entity2 's move and the revival of @entity93 -- which emphasized the principle of ' serve the people ' and a frugal lifestyle , and allowed chairman @entity102 to establish a relatively corruption - free bureaucracy			1
" pointing to a series of recent orders to ban official extravagance -- from banquets to year - end gifts -- as well as @entity2 's visit to the steamed bun eatery , @entity90 says the new leader is taking a leaf out of the late chairman 's book			1
however , economist @entity115 -- no relation to chairman @entity102 -- says @entity2 has failed to address the roots of corruption			1
" without systemic reform , new cases of corruption will pop up while old ones are being addressed , " he said			0
" the fundamental solution is to destroy the soil that breeds corruption -- the opportunities for officials to take bribes in areas like land control and family planning			2
" @entity132 on december 26 , @entity2 paid homage to @entity102 in his mausoleum on the 120th anniversary of the late chairman 's birth			1
the same day , @entity139 prime minister @entity138 defied @entity3 warnings and visited a controversial war shrine in @entity142 , capping a year of fast - deteriorating @entity139 relations stemming from competing claims over a chain of islands in the @entity147			2
@entity3 , @entity148 deploy @entity150 villain in latest spat @entity3 has certainly flexed its military muscles since @entity2 took control , sending its only aircraft carrier for a month - long training mission late last year in the @entity156 , where it is also locked in territorial disputes with several neighboring countries			1
most noticeably , though , the @entity3 military last november declared an air defense identification zone ( @entity162 ) in the @entity147 that includes the disputed islands			2
despite objections from the @entity166 and its allies , the @entity3 military has warned that it would identify , monitor and respond to any air threats or unidentified flying objects coming from the sea			2
@entity3 's air defense zone : what you need to know cheered by nationalists , who have yearned for the return of @entity102 - era hardline stance against the @entity166 or @entity179 , the @entity162 move is seen by some hawks as a sign of @entity2 's increasing strength and confidence			1
following @entity138 's shrine visit , the @entity0 government has declared him " not welcome " in @entity3			2
" @entity138 's shrine visit has given @entity2 the perfect excuse to project his power both at home and abroad , " said @entity186 , one of @entity3 's most prominent human rights activists , who was imprisoned for more than three years for his advocacy			1
" @entity138 helped @entity2 , who needs a rallying cry and an angle to divert public attention from domestic problems			2
" but more and more ordinary citizens are seeing through this and no longer willing to be used as the government 's pawn			0
" ' who am i ? ' left , center or right -- no matter where one stands ideologically -- @entity2 seems to keep sending everyone mixed signals			0
before @entity93 could finish savoring the news of @entity2 bowing in front of @entity102 's preserved body in his mausoleum and praising the late chairman on his anniversary , the president reportedly made no mention of @entity102 in his extensive remarks to senior government advisers on @entity217 and emphasized " liberating our thoughts " instead			1
@entity2 's fight against corruption and populist style have won him genuine admiration from a young , well - educated urban crowd			1
but he has also stifled freedom of speech in social media and cracked down on a nascent civil society movement -- often alienating or antagonizing the same demographic			0
@entity3 ' employs 2 million to police internet ' most controversial of all , in a widely circulated speech , @entity2 raised the notion of " not using the second 30 years ( of the @entity231 ) to repudiate the first 30 years , and vice versa			1
" the first three decades of communist rule after 1949 -- commonly referred to as the @entity102 era -- was largely remembered in the @entity235 as an isolated regime , a failed planned economy and a nation thrown into chaos by @entity102 's @entity240			0
the second three decades started in the late 1970s when late paramount leader @entity242 launched economic reform and re-opened the country to the outside world -- a period marked by breakneck economic growth as well as rising social tensions brought by a widening income gap and rampant corruption			0
for @entity93 , the " two 30 years " concept appears to be a natural correction to @entity242 and his successors ' deviation from the orthodox system			0
" chairman @entity102 is our founding father -- rejecting him means the rejection of the regime 's legitimacy , " said professor @entity90 , who has expressed disapproval of what happened to @entity77 , a big proponent of reviving @entity93			0
" the top leadership has noticed the grassroots support for @entity93 and taken action to reaffirm the regime 's foundation			0
" economist @entity102 holds a more nuanced view			0
he says @entity2 has made some progress with reforms amid strong resistance from entrenched interest groups			0
" maoists are his biggest threats because they are against reform and opening - up , which they consider to be a path of capitalist exploitation , " he said			0
" why bother reform at all if you do n't thoroughly reject the @entity280 ideology ? " so the fundamental questions about @entity2 remain : what does he stand for ? what does he want ? what are his values ? " other than an ambiguous notion of fulfilling the great @entity3 dream , it seems that @entity2 has n't given clear answers to these challenging questions			1
and as divisions in @entity3 society grow deeper , time may not be on his side -- and the future of 1.3 billion people is at stake .			0
