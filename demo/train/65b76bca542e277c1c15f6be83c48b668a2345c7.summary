@entity0 -- it won an @entity3 , made people forget " @entity6 " when they think @entity5 , and now the movie " @entity9 " may even pull off another feat -- help move legislation through @entity11			1
ex-iran hostages hope ' @entity9 ' win boosts quest for reparations the frustrated foreign service officer on the phone as the @entity19 embassy in @entity20 was under assault at the beginning of " @entity9 " was in real life @entity24			1
" that part of it was quite real			2
i mean , very much speeded - up but quite real , " @entity24 said from his home in suburban @entity0			2
the keepsakes and collages on the walls of @entity24 's study constantly remind him of his harrowing 444 days as a hostage in @entity20 34 years ago			1
not that he would ever forget			2
but for most people in @entity19 , the @entity20 hostage crisis was a distant memory until " @entity9 " brought it all back			1
@entity20 to add lawsuit over ' @entity9 ' to cinematic response unlike the six @entity38 who hid with the @entity40 ambassador who were the focus of " @entity9 , " @entity24 was one of the @entity38 held -- and tortured -- by @entity20 for 14 months			1
" i had a gun to my head , i was in solitary for nine months , " recalled @entity24 , who said that as a political officer at the embassy , he was not beaten and physically tortured as much as @entity45 officers were			1
" ten minutes before this happened , i was thinking about what 's going to happen in @entity20 , what 's going to happen to the left , what 's going to happen to the right , what 's going to happen with the former @entity56 , what 's going to happen with @entity19 relations			1
all the things that , sort of , all the inside the @entity62 stuff that we think about			2
" ten minutes later , all that was gone , " he continued			2
" that did n't matter at all , and i thought about only one thing ... get me out of here			2
how am i going to get out ? how am i going to get out of here ? and frankly , i did n't care what it took			0
" he was subjected to the mock executions depicted in " @entity9			1
" " they came in at 2 in the morning with , i think , masks and guns , pulled us out together to a place , lined us up against the wall , started chambering rounds into their guns , yelling orders			0
we did n't know what was going to happen ... i thought we were gone , " @entity24 said			0
when @entity24 and his fellow hostages were finally freed on january 20 , 1981 , they learned the @entity19 government gave up something big in return : as part of the @entity90 agreed to a day earlier , the hostages were barred from suing @entity20 in @entity19 court to seek compensation for their ordeal			1
decades of court challenges have gone nowhere and appeals to administrations in both parties have failed			0
the @entity99 administration has said it stands by the promise in the @entity90 not to sue @entity20			1
now , @entity101 , @entity102 , is pushing legislation to get the former hostages financial reward in a different way			1
he wants to put a surcharge on fines against companies that violate sanctions against @entity20 and use that money to create a compensation fund			1
@entity101 says the popularity of " @entity9 ' is helping			1
" a lot of people have seen it			0
they understand the abject horror that these people went through			0
i think most everybody will identify with the crisis and the suffering these people went through , and hopefully it will give us the impetus and the momentum to see to it that all these many years they 're actually compensated for their treatment , " @entity101 said			1
his bill would allow hostages to get $ 10,000 a day for each day of captivity , which comes to $ 4.4 million total for each hostage			1
@entity101 argues that finally compensating the hostages will send a message to @entity20 and to @entity19 personnel around the world , especially after four were killed at the @entity19 consulate in @entity139			1
" it just magnified that our diplomats overseas in harm 's way day in and day out are in constant danger , " @entity101 said about the @entity141 attack			0
" they need to also know that if they get violated , if they are captured , if they are tortured , that we 'll have their back -- that @entity19 will stand strong for them			2
" after @entity24 was freed , he returned to the foreign service for the rest of his career			0
he knew ambassador @entity159 , who was one of the four killed in @entity141			0
" he was one of our best			0
what a tragic loss , from him and the others who were there			0
there has to be protection , and also there has to be accountability for what goes on , " he said			0
@entity24 acknowledges that getting compensation from companies that violate sanctions against @entity20 is not ideal , but says decades of failed attempts to get direct accountability from @entity20 make him and other former hostages believe it is not in the cards			1
but he argues @entity20 needs to get the message once and for all that storming a @entity19 @entity181 and holding @entity38 hostage for more than a year has consequences			1
" the message has been so far , frankly , has been to the @entity185 : you got away with it			0
you can do these things and there are no consequences			0
well , what kind of message does that send on a moral level , on a human level , and on a political level ? if someone can get away with this , they can get away with worse			0
what kind of a foreign policy do you run ? what kind of a moral policy do you run when people can do something as outrageous as this , as shameful as this , that something violates every principle , not just of international law and conventions ? " @entity101 now has a @entity213 co-sponsor , sen. @entity214 of @entity215 , so the effort is now bipartisan			0
still , @entity213 @entity218 sources say the legislation will likely need to be tweaked before @entity218 foreign relations chairman @entity220 , @entity221 , will move it through his committee			2
for example , $ 4.4 million appears excessive to some lawmakers			0
but @entity24 agrees with @entity101 that the climate is now different thanks to " @entity9			2
" " before the film came out and before this renewed interest , we frankly had difficulty getting anyone to listen to our case , " @entity24 said			2
" we got expressions of sympathy , we got , you know , praise for our bravery , our service to our country			0
but frankly , that 's not what we were looking for , " he said .			0
