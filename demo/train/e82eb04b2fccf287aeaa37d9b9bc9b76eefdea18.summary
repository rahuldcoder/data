@entity0 -- it 's hard to find a lot of things in @entity5 , @entity6 , where thousands of workers have flocked for high - paying oil jobs			1
houses and apartments are in short supply , and those living in temporary abodes must wait for hours at run - down truck stops for a hot shower at the end of a long workday			1
@entity18 , 18 , found that out firsthand when he visited the oil boomtown a few months ago to help his brother find work there			1
the recent high school graduate , who is attending college this fall , knew there was an opportunity to make money in @entity5 , considered ground zero in the oil boom region known as the @entity30			1
lured by the possibility of six - figure salaries , thousands have flocked to the region , leaving nearly everything in short supply			2
@entity37 : workers score payday in @entity6 @entity18 's first idea was to create a camper with bunk beds , and rent that			1
but then he had a better idea			0
" while we were there we were getting pretty smelly , " @entity18 said			1
" [ we thought ] ' man , you ca n't get a shower anywhere			2
' so that 's where [ the idea ] really sparked			2
" @entity18 said during peak after - work hours , popular truck stops in the area utilize a number system and people line up for showers			1
sometimes the wait can be two or three hours , he said			1
" i mean the truck stops -- they 're just nasty , " @entity18 said			1
" they 're hard to get in and out			0
you get to certain ones ... and it 's just a zoo			2
" he said one man told him when he 's " feeling desperate for a good shower " he 'll drive 60 miles out of the way			1
he mentioned the idea of a shower house to his dad and , during their nine - hour drive back to their home in @entity75 , they mulled it over			2
" by the time we got home i was on the edge of my seat because i was so excited , " he said			0
a week later , enough time for his parents to realize he was serious and not being a fickle teenager , his folks asked if he was ready			0
@entity18 used an old 53 - foot semi-trailer from his father and , with the help of his family and friends , spent three weeks outfitting it with five private shower stalls			1
they also installed a washer and dryer , an office , and bought a separate water tanker			0
in mid-june , they took the tanker and trailer up to @entity5			1
" we had a blast doing it , " @entity18 said			2
gallery : check out other boomtown opportunists showers run $ 10 a pop -- $ 5 if you live in the makeshift village of campers where the mobile shower trailer is located			2
when he first got it up and running , @entity18 was manning it from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m. he soon changed that when he realized 90 % of his customers were coming between the peak after work hours of 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. these days , the place is staffed by one hired employee , because @entity18 is focused on his move to school			1
so far , they 're averaging between 20 and 25 customers a day , and he said he has probably made more than $ 5,000 -- although it will be awhile before he pays off the start - up costs			0
ideally he 'd love to sell the business			0
he has put an ad on @entity125 asking for $ 95,000 " or best offer			0
" classes at @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity130 , start september 6			0
@entity18 said music has been his " absolute passion " since he was a kid			1
he taught himself how to play guitar a few years back			0
" i just love creating music			0
it 's a blast , i could do it forever , " he said , adding that performing his own work is n't necessarily what he 's after			0
" i 'd rather make somebody a rock star that has better vocal talent than i do			0
" @entity18 said that while his parents would always be there to assist if he really needed it , the burden of tuition rests squarely on him			2
he is determined to balance his passion for music with the reality of life			0
" music is what i absolutely love doing , but for anything in life , if it does n't pay the bills you got ta find something that does , " he said .			0

@entity18 , 18 , noticed a lack of showers on a recent visit to @entity5 , @entity6
@entity5 is the epicenter of the region 's oil boom
many oil workers have to wait for hours to shower at local truck stops
@entity18 hopes his shower truck will help him earn money for music college
