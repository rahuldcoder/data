-- rubbished , reviled , rejected			0
as he posed on the @entity3 pitch with the glistening @entity5 trophy in his hand , @entity1 might have wondered what all the fuss had been about			1
@entity10 's dramatic late winner secured a 2 - 1 win victory over @entity12 and left @entity14 's interim manager with every right to feel proud			1
when he replaced @entity17 - winning coach @entity16 last november , he was welcomed into a cauldron of hate by @entity14 supporters			1
despised by those in blue following his time with @entity24 , the new interim manager was mercilessly mocked , abused and verbally attacked in the stands and on radio phone - in shows			1
perhaps more respect should have been afforded to a man who had led @entity24 to @entity17 glory in 2005 and @entity32 to @entity34 success in 2002 and 2004			0
instead , banners proclaimed " we 're just not interim " were unfurled , and @entity1 was left to fight an uphill battle against those who detested his very presence on the touchline at @entity40			0
but after securing @entity17 football for next season and claiming the @entity5 trophy , perhaps he will even be afforded a warm goodbye when he relinquishes his role after sunday 's game against @entity47			2
@entity1 's latest triumph comes just two months after his infamous rant at the club 's supporters following his side 's @entity53 victory at second division side @entity55			0
his attack on those who had delighted in criticizing his tenure may have raised eyebrows and earned him a censure from the club 's board , but it finally showed who was in charge			0
popularity has never been important to the @entity67			0
but @entity1 helped @entity14 salvage a season which had threatened to fall apart after it became the first ever defending title holder to drop out of the @entity17 at the group stage			2
the @entity71 became the first team to win @entity74 's top prize and then its secondary competition in successive seasons , though @entity77 managed the feat in reverse order before coach @entity80 -- widely tipped to rejoin @entity14 -- moved to @entity40 in 2004			1
a third - place finish and victory in the @entity5 is more than respectable for @entity1 , who was forced to swim against a tide of hate from the very start			1
he is just the second man after @entity86 to win the competition with two different clubs following his triumph with @entity32 in 2004 when it was known as the @entity5			1
all that , despite being faced with placards and posters calling for his head and being vilified at every opportunity			0
in the end , as he stood facing the @entity14 fans with the silverware in his hands , he could afford a little smile			2
if @entity80 is the man to come in , then at least @entity1 can be content with leaving his old adversary with a winning team			0
" that was a great performance in the second half , against a very good team , " @entity1 told @entity103 following the victory			0
" i 'm really pleased for the players and everyone involved			0
" we did n't have the legs in the first half , so we had to adapt			0
they players have worked so hard , all season			0
i am proud - it was not easy			2
i 'm really pleased , really proud			0
" it could have been different had @entity14 's opponent , @entity12 , managed to take some of the chances afforded to it on a night of drama			1
@entity12 began the brighter of the two , its players producing some sumptuous one - touch football which left @entity14 chasing shadows			1
as in @entity127 12 months ago , @entity14 spent much of the first half ensconced in its own half , desperately trying to prevent the @entity131 side from making the breakthrough it so badly craved			2
but for all the wonderful flowing football , @entity12 's deficiencies in front of goal were all too evident as it failed to convert any of the chances which came its way			2
instead , it was @entity14 in a rare foray into the @entity12 half which almost took the lead seven minutes before the break when @entity147 's rasping effort was clawed away by @entity148			1
that scare appeared to reinvigorate @entity12 and the @entity131 side almost moved ahead just minutes after the restart			1
@entity152 found space on the right and his exquisite cross was headed home by @entity157 -- only for his celebrations to be cut short by an offside flag			2
while the decision was the correct one , @entity157 was millimeters offside , it was the source of much frustration to a @entity12 side which quickly found itself behind			1
there appeared little trouble when @entity14 goalkeeper @entity167 threw the ball out towards @entity169 and when he failed to take control , @entity170 nipped in to run at the @entity12 defense and coolly slot the ball home			1
to its credit , @entity12 refused to buckle and @entity176 hit back within nine minutes to level when @entity157 fired home from the penalty spot following a handball by @entity180			1
buoyed by its equalizer , @entity12 pushed forward in search of a winner and @entity167 produced a fine save to push @entity157 's fierce drive over the crossbar			1
but while the red shirts poured forward , @entity14 looked dangerous on the break and @entity147 came within inches of winning the tie after his rasping 20 - yard effort smashed against the crossbar with two minutes remaining			1
the game appeared destined for extra time with the scores still level going into the final minute of stoppage time			1
but after @entity196 won a corner on the @entity14 right , @entity10 rose highest to meet @entity169 's corner and head a dramatic winner			1
" it 's a great feeling , " @entity10 told @entity103			2
" this team deserved this , because we have had a very difficult season and a lot of games			0
" in the end , today was a very hard game and @entity12 played very well			2
but we scored from set pieces and work very hard preparing that part of our game			0
" it was fitting that @entity10 should score the winner after he was forced to miss last year 's @entity17 final triumph over @entity217 through suspension			1
@entity147 , who became the club 's record goalscorer last weekend after taking his tally to 203 , was quick to praise the @entity223 defender and reveal he is close to signing a new contract			0
" it 's been an amazing time for all of us involved , " he told @entity103			0
" talk about ups and downs in the last two years ! but this is a big up			0
we 're a group , a team , and it was tight tonight after the long season we 've had			0
" no - one deserves this more than @entity10 -- he has been fantastic			1
you make your own luck , and we stick together in this group			0
" i really , really hope to be around next year			0
with a game tonight and coming up we have n't sat down and signed anything , but i really hope so and things are looking good			0
the club have been brilliant			0
" for @entity170 , it means he is now a reigning @entity245 winner , @entity246 winner , @entity17 winner and @entity5 winner -- the first for any player			1
" i am very happy , " the @entity252 international told @entity103			0
" it was a very tough game , and @entity12 were much better in the first half			2
the first half was not good enough at all			0
we really wanted to win this @entity5 , and maybe this was going to be our only chance			1
" this defeat caps a miserable week for @entity12 , which looks set to lose out on the @entity131 league title following a dramatic late defeat by rival @entity77			1
@entity12 has now lost its past seven major @entity17 finals -- all of which have come since being hit by the infamous " @entity264 curse "			2
@entity264 , a @entity265 coach , led @entity12 to glory in the @entity17 , winning the competition in 1961 and 1962			2
but after his request for a pay rise was turned down by the newly elected president @entity270 , @entity264 placed a curse on the club and declared it would not win the @entity17 for another 100 years			0
not even the great @entity273 , one of @entity12 's most famous sons , was able to help lift the curse when he visited @entity264 's grave before @entity12 's defeat in the 1990 @entity17 final			1
the curse appears to now include @entity74 's second trophy -- much to the dismay of the club 's manager @entity280			0
" the @entity12 fans were better than the @entity14 fans , " @entity280 told a press conference			1
" they deserved a @entity12 victory for their passion and their feelings and the patriotism they showed			2
" this defeat is difficult for me because of the @entity12 fans			2
for most of the 93 minutes , @entity12 was always better than @entity14			1

@entity14 wins the @entity5 following 2 - 1 win over @entity12
@entity10 scored in the final minute of stoppage time
@entity170 had given @entity14 the lead on *59* minutes
@entity157 equalized from penalty spot before late @entity10 winner
