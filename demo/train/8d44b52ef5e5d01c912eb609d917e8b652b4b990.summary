@entity0 -- so , they apparently did it again			1
for the second time in a decade , 15 - year - olds in @entity0 have scored at the top of the @entity7 global education assessment , ranking number one in the world in reading , math and science			1
the @entity14 city has a top performing system thanks in part to the strong drive and self - belief of its students , says @entity21 special advisor on education policy -- and @entity7 survey head -- @entity24			1
" in @entity0 , you have nine out of ten students telling you , ' it depends on me			2
if i invest the effort , my teachers are going to help me to be successful , ' " @entity24 tells me during a taping of @entity1 's " on @entity14 " on location in the city			1
the @entity0 exam results have come under fire for shutting out the city 's migrant children and not being representative of the city 's total student population -- something the @entity21 refutes			1
but one thing is for certain			0
the results are not representative of a nation			2
@entity14 as a whole does not take the @entity7 exam			1
data on a number of @entity14 cities and provinces is not yet published by @entity7			1
@entity14 as a whole is expected to be included in the 2015 assessment			2
data from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) at @entity55 in the @entity56 provides a stark picture of how @entity0 's education success is not repeated in @entity14 's less wealthy , rural interior			1
while 84 % of high school grads in @entity0 go to college , less than 5 % of @entity14 's rural poor make it to university			1
high school attendance is just 40 % in poor , rural areas of @entity14			1
and as they struggle with poverty and debate the opportunity cost of simply going to class , a significant number of rural students start dropping out in middle school			1
why are students dropping out ? across the world 's second biggest economy , the education system is vastly unequal			1
but incredibly , @entity24 tells me a child from a poor background in @entity14 has a better chance to be well educated than poor , rural students in other countries			2
" the learning environment you would encounter there , the quality is a lot higher than what you 'd encounter in a similar context almost anywhere else in the world , " he says			0
seated across from @entity24 during the " on @entity14 " panel discussion in @entity0 is @entity92 , the founder of @entity93 -- a non-profit that brings graduates from @entity14 and the @entity56 to teach at some of @entity14 's most under - resourced schools			1
@entity92 reveals a particularly bullish view on rural education in @entity14 : " a lot of these ( rural ) schools tend to be boarding schools			1
so the school provides not only a context for classroom instruction , it also provides a context for personal growth and exploration			0
" @entity92 's views are distinctly out of sync with that of educator @entity113 , currently the deputy principal of @entity114			0
" kids in the rural regions are at a huge disadvantage			0
teachers and school are under - resourced , " he says			0
" the other issue is that in the rural regions , there 's a lot of movement so parents move to the cities leaving their kids behind in the schools			0
so there is n't that parental support and guidance that kids need to thrive			0
" rural schools are under a lot of cultural stigma			0
no one in @entity14 believes they will succeed			0
" though @entity113 's assessment is in line with what has generally been reported about @entity14 's rural education challenges , @entity92 calls it an " irresponsible perception			1
" " it is a huge misconception that local communities are n't invested in the education of their children and grandchildren , " says the @entity93 founder			0
" i speak to grandmothers who are illiterate , who live often on two or three dollars a day ... who would do anything and stop at nothing to make sure that the child they have in their home is able to achieve a great education			0
" the big difficulty is that oftentimes , they do n't know where to start			0
" the @entity14 government is attempting to tackle the challenge			2
in 2010 , @entity14 released a 10 - year national education reform plan			1
among other objectives , it plans to focus less on tests and get the best teachers into the rural communities that desperately need them			0
" every discussion you have with @entity14 officials about education reform revolves around the question of equity , " says @entity92			1
but @entity113 is not optimistic about the prospects for education equity in @entity14			2
" over the years it will become worse and worse , " he says			0
" the rich and powerful are choosing to detach themselves from the traditional school system			0
" @entity113 sees a @entity14 where the wealthy will move education resources to a system of new private schools that cater only to them			2
and that is the dark future @entity14 must avoid			0
" if you do n't change the school system now , you 'll get people buying themselves out of it , " says @entity24			0
" that 's basically the challenge that @entity14 has			2

15 year olds in @entity0 rank number one in the world in reading , math and science
but *critics* argue exam results are not representative of the city 's total student population
debate about the quality of education available in @entity14 's poorer , rural interior
@entity14 released a 10 - year national education reform plan in 2010 to tackle the *problem*
