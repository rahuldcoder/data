-- a late goal from teenage substitute @entity2 gave @entity3 a hard - fought @entity5 victory over @entity6 at a sun - kissed @entity7			1
the 19 - year - old striker pounced on @entity11 's cut - back to drive the ball high into the net past @entity14 , sending @entity16 ' team into the last 16 of the @entity17 with a game to spare			2
in sunday 's second @entity5 fixture , @entity19 overcame @entity21 4 - 2 in @entity22 for its first @entity17 victory since defeating @entity24 in @entity25 1982			1
the results mean @entity6 , @entity19 and @entity21 all still have a chance of progressing to the second phase alongside @entity3 , with the final round of matches on thursday			1
@entity3 1 - 0 @entity6 in what was largely a tepid and tame match , @entity3 controlled much of the possession -- although it was @entity6 who had the better of the early play and chances			1
@entity39 's low drive from the edge of the box was saved by @entity42 as the sides sized each other up early on			0
@entity45 missed a glorious chance for the @entity47 just before halftime when he headed wide unmarked from only eight yards out			0
@entity50 's men felt they should have had penalty earlier in the half after @entity53 tumbled under the challenge of @entity55 but the referee adjudged the @entity47 midfielder to have stumbled over the ball			0
if the first half was starved of chances , the second half was famished			0
there was little of note until the last 15 minutes when the @entity64 began to press @entity65 drilled a free kick from 25 yards low against @entity14 's right - hand post before @entity11 had a shot deflected narrowly wide after displaying some nifty footwork inside the @entity47 penalty area			2
but just as a draw seemed likely , the @entity72 star again weaved some magic to set up @entity75 -- who had come on in the second half to replace the ineffectual @entity77			0
the late strike also marked the first time a teenager has scored at a @entity17 since @entity81 did so for @entity82 against @entity83 in 2006			0
" it was a highly tactical game , " a satisfied @entity84 told reporters after the match			0
" we were fresher , we were better and that made the difference -- maybe due to our very good fitness preparations			0
" with qualification now guaranteed , the 45 - year - old also hinted at resting players for the final group match against @entity21 thursday			1
" we want to be number one in the group but if there are yellow cards or for reasons of freshness i may make a decision , " said @entity16 , who is @entity3 's all - time leading scorer at the @entity17 with five goals from the three tournaments he played at from 1994 - 2002			2
@entity50 , meanwhile , lamented what he saw as his side 's hard luck in his post match comments			0
" the truth of the matter is we had chances to win it but we lost			0
both teams gave it their all and unfortunately it was @entity3 that was able to make it , " the @entity112 said			2
" we have to look forward and i said when we came to play in this @entity17 after being absent for 12 years that this will be a great help for us to understand the level we need to be at in future competitions			0
" @entity19 4 - 2 @entity21 the @entity19 picked up their first @entity17 victory in 32 years after a three - goal first - half blitz at @entity122			1
man of the match @entity123 , defender @entity123 and forward @entity124 gave the @entity125 a convincing lead as they overpowered the 2002 semifinalist			0
@entity129 pulled a goal back for @entity21 at the beginning of the second half before @entity133 -- who switched allegiance from his native @entity135 last year -- restored @entity19 's advantage with a tidy finish after a one - two with @entity123 on the edge of the area			1
@entity21 captain @entity140 then pulled another back with 18 minutes remaining , but @entity19 held on for the historic win			1
coach @entity143 , who guided @entity144 to the last @entity17 but was fired before it started , knows his team can reach the second round for the first time by beating @entity6 on thursday			2
@entity6 can also progress with a win if @entity21 fails to defeat @entity3			1
if @entity19 and @entity6 draw , @entity21 can go through by beating @entity3			1
if @entity6 and @entity21 both win , the @entity150 side will have to do so by two more goals to overcome its differential deficit			1

@entity3 defeats @entity6 1 - 0 in @entity5 *clash* at @entity156
late goal from substitute @entity2 *settles* affair
@entity19 defeat @entity21 4 - 2 in second @entity5 fixture of day
