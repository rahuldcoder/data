-- @entity2 has overtaken @entity3 as the world 's biggest importer of weapons , with @entity8 nations the most aggressive consumers of military hardware , a new report says			1
between 2007 and 2011 , @entity2 's business accounted for 10 % of the global arms market , according to data from the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
@entity15 was next , accounting for 6 % of sales , followed by @entity17 and @entity3 ( 5 % ) and @entity18 ( 4 % )			0
@entity19 , a senior analyst with @entity14 , said @entity2 's defense spending reflects its regional security concerns and @entity23 's global aspirations			1
" @entity2 procures arms in relation to its tense relationship with @entity17 and increasingly sees @entity3 as a potential threat , " he told @entity0			2
" it also wants to assert itself as a major regional or even global power			0
" much of this expenditure has focused on the modernization of its armed forces with the purchase of fighter jets and warships , according to the @entity38			1
meanwhile , @entity3 's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget , investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program			1
many of these weapons are instead produced domestically			0
at the @entity50 earlier this month , @entity49 announced plans to increase its military spending by 11.2 % , a move some analysts suspect is in response to @entity56 plans to increase its military presence in the @entity58 -- an assertion it has rejected , saying its spending is in proportion to its economy			0
@entity3 increases defense spending " the @entity3 government has maintained reasonable and appropriate growth in defense spending on the strength of rapid economic and social development and the steady increase of fiscal revenues , " @entity50 spokesman @entity64 told reporters in march			1
but @entity3 's announcement is sure to stoke concerns among some its neighbors			0
@entity3 regards @entity77 as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence			0
@entity49 has also claimed a significant portion of the @entity84 as its own territorial waters , putting it in conflict with other nations that have made claims on portions of the region			0
@entity19 said @entity3 has gradually modernized its armed forces and arms industry in the past two decades			1
he said development of the latter was mainly influenced by an embargo on arms sales to @entity3 imposed by @entity98 nations and the @entity56 after the 1989 @entity100 crackdown			0
this , he said , forced @entity3 to look to other sources such as @entity103 for new equipment and licenses to produce weapons itself , which in turn helped to improve its own indigenous arms production capability			2
as a result , @entity3 has become a major exporter of arms			2
according to @entity14 , it is now the world 's sixth largest seller behind the @entity56 , @entity103 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- with @entity2 's long - time foe @entity17 chief among its clients			2
@entity103 's defense industry has been the chief beneficiary of @entity2 's custom , according to @entity14 , though @entity116 has recently muscled in with new deals to supply submarines in addition to @entity128 and @entity129 combat aircraft from @entity130			1
@entity14 estimates @entity2 is likely to spend more than $ 100 billion on weapons in the next 15 years .			0
