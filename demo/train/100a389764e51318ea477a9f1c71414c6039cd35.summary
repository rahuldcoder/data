@entity25 passes milestone but @entity1 in control pick of the @entity30 bowlers was paceman @entity31 -- who took four for 64 -- while leg - spinner @entity32 mopped up three wickets towards the end of the innings , his first in test cricket			1
both @entity15 and @entity16 scored 88 but , apart from an impressive 38 not out from @entity38 , not one other @entity39 scored above 20 , leaving the match finely poised going into the third day			0
bad light ended proceedings early , with @entity3 failing to score from the four balls they faced			2
