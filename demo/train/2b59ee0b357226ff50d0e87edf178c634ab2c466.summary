@entity0 , @entity1 -- a group of former @entity6 military and intelligence officers , including retired @entity7 , appear in a 22 - minute documentary that was released on wednesday asserting that the @entity10 administration has leaked considerable classified intelligence about the raid that killed @entity13 for political gain			1
they also claim that the administration has given itself too much credit for this feat of @entity6 arms and intelligence gathering			1
the film even makes the dramatic charge that the @entity10 administration is " purposefully putting lives in jeopardy " because of its purported leaks about national security			1
the charges bear some resemblance to the " @entity37 " tactics used against sen. @entity29 in the tight 2004 presidential election against president @entity31 in which @entity29 's service in @entity33 , seemingly a strength of the candidate , was turned into a weakness			0
@entity39 strategists : @entity41 attack ads are this year 's @entity37 campaign the particulars of the indictment against @entity10 as laid out in the new film , which is titled " @entity46 , " are : -- the president announced the @entity13 raid before intelligence picked up from @entity13 's compound could be fully exploited			1
-- the use of hitherto covert " stealth " helicopters on the raid was publicized			0
-- the name of the secret unit that executed the raid -- @entity57 -- was made public putting them and their families at risk			2
-- the name of the @entity63 doctor recruited by the @entity64 to help find @entity13 was leaked , jeopardizing him and the @entity64 's ability to recruit spies in the future			2
the doctor is now serving 33 years in a @entity63 prison			0
@entity63 doctor who helped @entity6 appeals verdict -- @entity10 has taken way too much credit for killing @entity74 's leader			1
" mr. president , you did not kill @entity13 , @entity6 did			1
the work that the @entity6 military has done killed @entity13			1
you did not , " says a former @entity7 interviewed in the film			0
criticism of the way that the @entity13 raid has been discussed publicly by the @entity10 administration makes up the bulk of " @entity46 , " but the administration is also taken to task for supposedly leaking details of covert @entity6 actions against the @entity91 nuclear program to @entity93 reporter @entity92 ( who has said he was not the recipient of " deliberate leaks out of the @entity96 " ) and outlining to other journalists the personal involvement of @entity10 in selecting targets for the @entity64 drone program in @entity63			1
one former @entity7 featured in the film demands dramatically , " tell the president to stop leaking information to the enemy			2
" is there any merit to these serious accusations ? in fact , @entity10 and his national security team made every effort -- successfully -- to keep the intelligence about @entity13 a closely held secret for almost a year , from the time they first identified what they believed might be the @entity74 leader 's hideout in the city of @entity120 , @entity63 , in august 2010 until may 1 , 2011 , when the raid was launched to kill him			1
the raid itself was conducted as a covert operation under the overall direction of then - cia director @entity127			0
i have written a book about the hunt for @entity13 during the course of which i was the only journalist granted access by the @entity63 inside the compound in @entity120 where @entity13 was killed			2
i also spoke on the record about the hunt for @entity13 with a variety of current @entity96 , @entity137 and intelligence officials , as well as former @entity137 and @entity64 officials familiar with aspects of the story			1
none of them divulged classified information about the @entity13 operation			1
indeed , they went to great pains to avoid doing so			0
what precipitated the operation going public was not @entity10 's announcement of the raid but the crash of one of the @entity156 choppers used in the raid , which turned what had hitherto been a covert operation into a very public event			1
@entity63 journalists started arriving at @entity13 's @entity120 compound soon after the helicopter crashed and started filing stories about the mysterious helicopter and its oddly shaped tail rotor			2
an @entity120 resident even tweeted about the unusual sound of helicopters flying over the city in the middle of the night			0
it was n't much of a leap for reporters to ascertain that these helicopters had particular features that had prevented them from being detected by @entity63 radar			0
soon after the @entity7 had raided the @entity120 command , @entity63 officials on the ground were interrogating @entity13 's wives and children at the compound who told them that @entity13 had just been killed			2
none of this was going to stay secret for long			0
indeed , it was gen. @entity188 , @entity63 's top military officer , who sped up the @entity10 administration 's announcement of the raid			1
a few hours after the raid , @entity188 told his @entity6 counterpart , adm. @entity193 , " our people need to understand what happened here			2
we 're not going to be able to manage the @entity63 media without you confirming this			0
you can explain it to them			0
they need to understand that this was @entity13 and not just some ordinary @entity6 operation			1
" @entity193 then told @entity10 and his national security team , " @entity188 has asked for us to go public , " which swayed @entity10 to announce the raid sooner than was planned			2
( @entity10 wanted to wait for 100 % dna confirmation that it was @entity13			1
at the time of the president 's announcement about the raid the confirmation was at 95 %			0
) during his speech to the nation and world , @entity10 did not divulge the name of @entity57 , saying only that a " small team of @entity6 carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability			1
" a visit to @entity13 's lair it quickly leaked that @entity57 had executed the raid , but this was hardly surprising as the @entity7 are the principal @entity228 in the @entity1 / @entity63 theater , something that has been discussed in multiple news stories over the past several years and in bestselling books such as " @entity233 " by former @entity7 @entity234			2
and the @entity7 have hardly kept a low profile of late , cooperating in a movie " @entity242 " that was released in theaters this year , which actually featured real seals playing the parts of the heroes of the movie			0
perhaps if you had absolutely no knowledge of the @entity6 military , or indeed access to @entity247 where @entity57 has had an entry since 2004 , it would be news to you that @entity57 , along with the @entity251 's @entity250 , are @entity6 's premier counterterrorism units			2
obviously , a mission to take out @entity13 would not be entrusted to any other than these elite units			2
so the notion that the public naming of the unit that killed @entity13 endangers the lives of its members and their families is overwrought			0
members of @entity57 are well able to take care of themselves and their families			0
and who first leaked the involvement of @entity57 in the @entity13 operation remains unclear			0
it is just plain wrong that anyone in the @entity6 government leaked the name of the @entity64 asset in @entity63 , dr @entity272 , who was recruited by the agency in its quest to find @entity13			1
this information first surfaced in a story in the @entity279 newspaper in july 2011 after @entity272 was arrested by the @entity63 intelligence service , @entity280			0
it is obvious that this information was leaked not by the @entity6 but the @entity63 who have done their own investigation of the @entity13 raid , which embarrassed them considerably			1
as to the notion that @entity10 has taken too much credit for the @entity13 raid , well he is commander - in - chief , and it was entirely his decision to launch the risky raid on @entity120 based on the only fragmentary intelligence that @entity13 might be there			1
as adm. @entity293 , who was the military commander of the @entity13 raid , told @entity2 's @entity294 last month , " at the end of the day , make no mistake about it , it was the president of the @entity6 that shouldered the burden for this operation , that made the hard decisions , that was instrumental in the planning process , because i pitched every plan to him			1
" the raid decision was opposed by vice president @entity306 , who had run for the @entity308 nomination for the presidency against @entity10			2
if @entity306 had won the @entity96 in 2008 , @entity13 might still be alive			1
and the decision to do the raid was also opposed by secretary of defense @entity312 , who had served every president going back to @entity314			0
@entity312 was concerned about some kind of replay of the 1980 @entity91 hostage rescue debacle , which helped to turn president @entity318 into a one - term president			0
the notion that the decision to greenlight the risky raid was made by anyone other than @entity10 is just plain silly , and it was a decision he made against the advice of both his vice president and his secretary of defense			2
the film " @entity46 " gets even sillier			0
at one point one of the former officers interviewed for the film charges that the @entity10 administration " divulged to the world we are using drone technology			1
" the fact that the @entity6 uses drones in @entity63 is one of the world 's worst kept secrets			0
in fact , the @entity340 where i work has maintained a public database of these attacks since early 2010			0
' first look at the @entity13 movie similarly , the claim that the @entity10 administration has recently leaked information about the @entity350 virus attacks on the @entity91 nuclear program to the @entity93 is overblown , as this information has been reported since 2010 , and the @entity91 themselves publicly acknowledged that their nuclear program was under cyberattack two years ago			1
it is true that the @entity6 role in the cyberattacks was disclosed in the @entity93			0
and in june , attorney general @entity358 appointed two federal prosecutors to investigate leaks including the @entity93 story about @entity10 ordering the cyberattacks against @entity91 with the @entity350 virus			0
there remains much that is unknown about the still - classified intelligence surrounding the @entity13 raid , including : -- how did the @entity64 find the real name of @entity13 's courier who was the key to finding him ? -- how was the courier 's cell phone first tracked down ? -- how was he tracked to @entity13 's compound in @entity120 ? -- how did the @entity64 establish a safe house in @entity120 ? and who staffed it ? none of this information has been leaked , and it remains classified for good reason as it gets into the @entity64 's " sources and methods			1
" do n't expect to hear any of those details any time soon .			0

former @entity6 officers accuse @entity10 of leaking classified information for political gain
@entity388 says much of the information cited came from sources outside @entity96
he says administration sought to keep details secret , but events led to disclosures
@entity388 says the idea that @entity10 does n't deserve credit for @entity13 raid is wrong
