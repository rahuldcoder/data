" the magazine is not a mere publication			1
for us it is journalism of purpose			0
" although prostitution is illegal in @entity1 , it is a thriving underground industry and voluntary groups estimate that there are about 2 million women sex workers			1
launched six months ago , the magazine is a platform for the collective memories , nostalgia and dreams of the sex worker community and an attempt to wean their children away from the profession , said editor @entity73			2
