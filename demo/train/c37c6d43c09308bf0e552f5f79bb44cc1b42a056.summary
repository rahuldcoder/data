" the @entity18 will have to use military forces to resolve the situation for peace and order			1
" the attack occurred at about 2 a.m. local time thursday when gunmen on a pickup truck opened fire on a protest camp near the site of @entity0 's @entity34 , where protesters have been camped for months , said lt. gen. @entity36 , @entity4 's national security adviser to the prime minister			1
@entity0 's @entity38 reported that three people were killed in the attack and 23 injured			1
the fatally injured victims included a 21 - year - old man , who was shot in the chest , and a 51 - year - old man			2
later that morning , anti-government protesters stormed the grounds of an @entity48 office compound , forcing the country 's caretaker prime minister to flee a meeting with members of the @entity53			1
@entity36 said the protesters drove a truck through a gate to reach the front of an @entity48 office complex , while new interim premier @entity59 and ministers were meeting in another part of the building			1
as a result of the disruption , the meeting was called off and the politicians left the venue , said @entity36			2
@entity48 spokesman air vice marshal @entity67 told @entity1 that the protesters , who are seeking the government 's ouster , then demanded to " inspect " the room to check that the prime minister was no longer inside			2
" we allowed them in to see , and they said they would have a bit of a rest before they left , " he said			0
some protesters remained to stage a sit - in at the complex			2
@entity4 was rocked by rival mass political protests over the weekend , with pro- and anti-government supporters taking to the streets in their tens of thousands following fresh twists in the country 's protracted political crisis			1
@entity4 turmoil caretaker prime minister @entity91 was removed from office along with nine cabinet ministers by a top court last wednesday , and subsequently indicted by the country 's anti-graft body			0
if the country 's @entity97 votes to impeach her , she could be banned from politics for five years			0
watch : acting @entity100 -- ' government still in charge ' protesters led by the @entity104 have been agitating against her government since november , calling for it to be replaced with an unelected interim government			0
drawn mainly from @entity0 's royalist , middle class establishment , the anti-government protesters have been seeking to rid @entity4 politics of the alleged influence of @entity91 's brother , the former prime minister @entity113			1
@entity113 , a telecommunications tycoon , was overthrown in a 2006 military coup and has since lived in self - imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction			0

the november protests that sparked the current crisis were triggered by the government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for his return to the political fold			0
the anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections , which the opposition @entity133 has boycotted , arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held			1
' judicial coup ' ? meanwhile the government 's " red shirt " support base , many of whom hail from the country 's rural north and northeast , view @entity91 's ouster as a " judicial coup " and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country 's institutions against their side			0
@entity91 , who was elected in a landslide at the polls in 2011 , is the third @entity113 - linked prime minister to be dismissed by the @entity157 , which also dissolved @entity113 's @entity159 political party in 2007			0
analyst @entity160 , director at @entity161 , a @entity0 - based risk assessment firm , told @entity1 last week that @entity91 's supporters saw her dismissal as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach			2
" they consider it a way to usurp democratic elections , " he said , adding that the opposition was unlikely to win at the polls			0
" the @entity133 say ' no , we ca n't have elections , ' because they know they will lose those elections , " he said			0
