@entity0 -- the @entity2 does not have the money to meet an obligation to a retiree health care trust fund coming due at the end of the month , but if there 's a default , officials promise no interruption in the mail , the payroll , or payments to suppliers			1
commenting in response to a @entity18 article monday suggesting the @entity2 may have to shut down within months , spokeswoman @entity15 told @entity1 there 's " nothing actually new in the @entity2 's position			1
" " we are required to make this $ 5.5 billion dollar payment into the future retiree health benefits fund , and probably wo n't be able to make it when it comes due september 30th			1
" the fund was mandated by a 2006 postal reform act that postal officials today believe does not match the reality of declining revenues and a smaller workforce			2
tuesday , congressional lawmakers will address the matter in a hearing on postal operations			2
@entity15 said at that hearing , postmaster general @entity36 will insist that the fund be re-scaled from the days when there were 900,000 people on the payroll			1
the mandated funding level has not changed in the years since then , although the @entity2 has trimmed 250,000 jobs			2
she said " the fact is , no other government agency , and few corporations in the private sector are required to fund retiree health benefits 75 years out			0
" the newspaper quoted @entity52 sen. @entity51 , @entity53 , as saying the financial problems are so dire the @entity2 may close later this year			0
@entity15 agrees her agency does not have a sustainable business model , but stopped short of saying a shutdown is possible			0
one answer is to adjust those mandated payments			0
" we want to have the pre-funding mandate eliminated , and have the money already paid into it used for those purposes " of covering health care benefits for future retirees			0
she said , " we 've overpaid into our retirement funds , and we 'd like some of those overpayments refunded and used for future funding			0
" she acknowledged the basis for the advance payments were mandated in 2006 because lawmakers wanted assurances the @entity2 could cover benefits for its future pensioners			1
in addition to relief from the future retiree payment mandate , @entity15 said the proposed business plan of the @entity2 would include a combination of closing post offices , expanding joint ventures with private industry , and changes in how often you get the mail			1
" right now we are required to deliver six days a week , " she said , " if it can go to five days a week , as proposed , we could better match the declining volume of mail			0

@entity2 may miss september 30 payment to retiree fund
officials *vow* no interruption in payroll , mail , or payments to suppliers
