@entity0 -- the @entity2 has apologized to @entity4 's @entity3 after a reporter revealed the monarch was " pretty upset " that @entity4 officials had failed to arrest radical @entity9 cleric @entity8			1
usually private conversations with members of @entity4 's royal family remain private			1
but in an extraordinary breach of this convention on @entity16 , security correspondent @entity13 said the queen told him she had asked a government official why @entity19 remained at large during his days as the imam of a mosque in @entity0			2
who is @entity19 ? the revelation that the queen had personally lobbied a government official over @entity19 , convicted in @entity4 for soliciting murder and inciting hatred in 2006 , came as @entity13 was discussing @entity19 's probable extradition to the @entity28 on terror charges			1
speaking to today program host @entity30 , @entity13 said : " actually , i can tell you that the queen was pretty upset that he was , this man was , there was no way to arrest him			1
she could n't understand why -- surely there must have been some law he must have broken			0
well in the end , sure enough there was			0
he was eventually convicted and sentenced for 7 years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred			0
" @entity30 , clearly taken aback by @entity13 's revelation of a private conversation he 'd had with the queen , called the disclosure a " corker " and said , " that 's a fascinating piece of information , @entity50			1

" @entity13 said : " she spoke to the home secretary at the time and said , ' surely this man must have broken some laws , why is he still at large ? ' " the queen rarely expresses her opinions -- let alone political views -- in public			0
her role is to stay above politics , so @entity13 's disclosure is a rare insight into how she privately engaged with @entity4 's government on a specific subject			1
@entity1 's royal correspondent @entity70 says the convention for anyone meeting the queen at a palace event is that the conversation is private			2
he said : " if you accept the invitation , you accept that anything said is off the record			0
" in a statement on its website , the @entity2 wrote : " this morning on the today programme our correspondent @entity13 revealed details of a private conversation which took place some years ago with the @entity3			1
" " the conversation should have remained private and the @entity2 and @entity50 deeply regret this breach of confidence			2
@entity50 is extremely sorry for the embarrassment caused and has apologised to the @entity91			0
" when reached for a comment , a @entity91 spokesman told @entity1 : " we never comment on private conversations			0
