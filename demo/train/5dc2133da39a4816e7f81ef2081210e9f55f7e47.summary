@entity0 , @entity1 -- my friend 's eight - year - old daughter burst into tears while watching a @entity8 video release on tv the other evening			1
the terrorist group has been receiving the kind of local and international media coverage that could make even a @entity14 megastar explode with envy			1
at the current rate , the group 's leader , @entity16 , might as well be given his own reality show			2
i understand the reporting of a bomb blast : the need to let the world know about 234 missing school girls is obvious			0
updating us on the world 's efforts to rescue the abducted girls definitely makes sense			2
but why should law - abiding citizens be bombarded with the megalomaniac audio and video rantings of every @entity34 recording forwarded to the press ? as news organizations around the world scrambled to make amends for their belated coverage of the kidnapped school girls , @entity8 contributed to the media frenzy by releasing a video in which @entity16 boasted that he would sell the girls for the equivalent of $ 12 each			1
since then , many of us have had to endure , from local and international media , several replays of the villain 's @entity49 gloating into the camera			1
the group 's earlier video released days after the bombing of a bus park in an @entity0 suburb ( which took place a few hours before the abductions ) featured @entity16 barking bombastic statements such as : " we are in your city but you do n't know where we are " , " ( president ) @entity65 , you are now too small for us			2
we can only deal with your grand masters like @entity72 , the president of @entity73 ... even they can not do anything to us ... we are more than them , " and " so , because of that tiny incident that happened in @entity0 , everybody is out there making an issue of it across the globe ? " these taunts and other details of the video were broadly reported by international news organizations , even at a time the world was paying little attention to the missing girls -- when @entity1 were yet to know exactly how many students had been abducted , their names , and what they and their families looked like			0
the media has also been sophisticating its coverage of @entity8 's activities			1
what looks to me like the effort of steamy thugs to stock up on females to meet their physiological and domestic needs -- while grabbing major headlines in the process -- has been glamorised as " an attack on the right of girls to education			2
" additional reports that more girls were stolen from their homes -- not school , this time -- in @entity110 and @entity111 villages of @entity112 , should have caused the media to finally acknowledge the abductions for the common criminality that they really are			2
besides , anyone following the news closely might have heard that these abductions of females have been carrying on for quite some time , though never on the scale that has recently shocked the world			0
opinion : how @entity124 can fight back against @entity8 similarly glamorous motives were ascribed to @entity8 's bombing of two newspaper offices in @entity1			1
headlines described the april 2012 incident as " an attack on @entity131			0
" however , @entity16 's video release , which followed soon after , gave his actual , rather primitive reasons : " ... each time we say something , it is either changed or downplayed ... i challenge every @entity1 to watch that video again			0
there is no place our imam either said he will crush president @entity65 or issued an ultimatum to the government in @entity1 , but nearly all papers carried very wrong and mischievous headlines			0
" i can imagine the @entity147 - clad hoodlums scrambling to @entity148 after each fresh aggression , frantically typing their leader 's name and some relevant key words			0
there was nothing complex about the group 's motives : the newspaper office bombings were a mere act of raw revenge			0
@entity8 is probably just a gang of plundering hoods masquerading as a group with higher motives that could warrant dialogue -- never mind that they may have attracted the alliance of more sinister sponsors with more strategic purposes			1
the group claims " @entity177 education is a sin " yet records its threats with hi - tech video equipment and employs advanced ammunition to destroy ; it has no clear target and attacks willy - nilly , a la @entity170 ; and its conduct is as @entity124 as that of the street preacher who kidnapped and raped @entity174 was @entity175			1
the media and expert analysts are the ones who seem to be supplying @entity8 with all the grand motives they may never really have thought about in the first place			1
as an author , who has had expert reviewers dissect my book and ascribe to my writing various meanings of which i had absolutely no idea , i am quite familiar with how something straightforward can suddenly be accorded impressive complexity			0
we may not be able to take the guns and bombs out of the hands of @entity8 and their ilk yet , but since they are not content to take full advantage of @entity203 or @entity204 -- as many other attention - seekers of this age are -- the media must stop fuelling their inner psychopaths			1
if they wo n't travel to @entity14 and patiently wait tables until they get noticed by @entity211 , we must not offer them stardom on a platter			0
there has to be a better way of passing on the relevant information and awareness of danger about terrorists to the public , without creating superstar monsters .			0

@entity223 : why must citizens be bombarded with @entity8 " rantings "
@entity230 's aim is glamorised , *misrepresented* by media , she argues
conduct is as @entity124 as that of preacher who kidnapped @entity174 was @entity175 , she writes
media must stop fuelling their inner psychopaths , offering them stardom on a plate
