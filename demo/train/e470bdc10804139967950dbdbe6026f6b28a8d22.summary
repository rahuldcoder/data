we 're all past high school age			2
" ( @entity18 , the 2011 tv movie sequel with a whole new group of girls , is best not mentioned			1
) like any good twenty - something , i love the movie , but the " no sequel " news is totally for the best			1

currently , she 's a teacher , and has a quiet life with good friends ( including @entity96 , but not @entity97 ; he knows what he did )			0
her secret pleasure is reading celebrity gossip , but she ca n't help but feel for the young women the tabloids exploit , regardless of the mistakes they may have made			1
