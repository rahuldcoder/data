-- the social media universe has been aghast this week after the revelation that @entity3 of @entity4 has invested $ 300 million in @entity5			1
the shock and awe seems to center around the notion that @entity5 has been at least partly responsible for the @entity10 uprisings that directly threaten the @entity4 royal family 's grip on power			1
on the surface , anyway , this seems like a contradiction			0
why would the king 's nephew be investing in the medium of his family 's enemy ? will he attempt to influence the development of the network or try to make it more susceptible to censorship in a regime - threatening emergency ? and what of @entity5 ? will the participation of a major investor widely considered to be the beneficiary of one of the world 's most exploitative dynasties tarnish the company 's otherwise net - friendly brand image ? why would @entity5 accept such an investor , and why would he court them in the first place ? the answer , most simply , is for the money			1
prince @entity3 is no doubt aware of @entity5 and @entity43 's tremendous influence in his own and neighboring countries , and may even be personally concerned about what a revolution might do to his own and his family 's sovereign rule			1
but why should that stop him from positioning himself to become the wealthiest deposed royal he can be ? it 's a win - win			2
for its part , @entity5 , which is n't even a public company , is not actually selling shares to a @entity4 prince			1
it 's @entity5 's early investors who are selling $ 300 million of their own shares to the @entity3 's investing group , " @entity60			1
" of course , @entity5 benefited by selling those shares initially , and now benefits indirectly as the resale of these shares puts the company 's total valuation up to $ 8.4 billion			1
the dismay and disillusionment associated with this transaction seems overblown to me , or at least misplaced			0
in short , we are looking at the wrong medium			0
we are not witnessing @entity5 operate against its central , democratizing premise			1
we are witnessing money operate in perfect accordance with its own , highly abstracting premise			2
@entity80 , by its very nature , launders			0
this is exactly what money and the corporation were invented 700 years ago to do : provide kings and other members of the aristocracy with a way to invest at arm 's length in projects they may or may not want to be associated with			2
the corporation gives people a way to invest passively in companies whose operations they might not want to know about , much less be known for			0
likewise , generic , central currencies give people who have done lord - knows - what the very same access to markets as those who have earned their money through sweat or innovation			0
once it 's money , it is as clean as anyone else 's money			2
similarly , once you sell your business to shareholders , they can do what they like with the shares			0
that 's what is meant by shareholding			0
in the simplest language possible , when you sell your business , you have sold your business			0
( maybe that 's why so many top people have been leaving @entity5 lately			1
their shares have vested and they are less restricted about what they can do with them once they quit			0
) this is the beauty and horror of investment capital			0
just as a @entity4 prince can invest in our revolution - inspiring @entity132 darlings , each of us is free to invest our own retirement savings in the likes of cigarette and liquor companies , weapons manufacturers , polluters , outsourcers and sweatshop exploiters			1
we can put our kids through college by investing in the very oil companies through which the @entity4 royals made their money in the first place			1
then , hopefully , our kids can go on to become peace workers , revolutionaries or even @entity5 employees			2
if we 're truly concerned about the long arm of international investing , we might best reconsider how we invest ourselves			0
instead of relying on the anonymity of outsourced investing to the stock market , why not look around for who or what needs money in our towns and communities ? the @entity162 administration is already in the process of curtailing the regulations that prevent nonmillionaire investors from putting money into one anothers ' businesses			2
this means we can begin to depend on local money to start - up our own ventures , and on local ventures to build our own savings			0
and at that point , if we do n't feel like having a @entity4 prince participate , we can just say no. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			1

@entity4 prince @entity3 invests $ 300 million in @entity5 shares

he says the prince is doing what investors do everywhere : *buying* shares to make money
