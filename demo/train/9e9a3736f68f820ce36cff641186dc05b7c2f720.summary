@entity0 -- is @entity2 capable of doing anything right ? it 's a question worth asking as @entity5 and @entity6 threaten for the third time this year to shut down the federal government			1
@entity9 faced the same prospect during spring budget talks and the summer debt ceiling debate			0
now it 's happening over what was expected to be passage of a routine bill to fund @entity0 through mid-november while replenishing disaster relief funds			1
friday is the latest deadline to avoid a partial shutdown			1
the @entity20 -- tasked with helping states hit hard by @entity22 , @entity23 , and a series of recent wildfires and tornadoes -- will likely run out of money even sooner			0
the details have differed with each threatened shutdown , but the basic plot remains the same			1
@entity5 want to spend more while @entity6 are using a series of statutory deadlines to force an agenda of spending cuts			0
the two sides have proven incapable of compromising until the last possible second			0
meanwhile , analysts warn that the repeated partisan brinksmanship is undermining consumer and business confidence , and may help bring on a double - dip recession			1
@entity2 bickers and you suffer			1
they brawl ; your 401 ( k ) falls			0
to make matters worse , there 's no one villain to blame			2
if you want to know why @entity2 is repeatedly taking @entity0 to the brink and raising the country 's collective economic anxiety , you have to look at a number of factors			1
some are political , others perhaps psychological			2
we have a " political system that looks manifestly broken , " @entity5 treasury secretary @entity55 said last week			2
" the gridlock and partisanship in @entity0 right now is disgusting , " sen. @entity58 , @entity59 , said monday			0
" it 's unacceptable for @entity2 to add more uncertainty to the marketplace by threatening another government shutdown			1
" @entity66 , a professor of political science , communications , and psychology at @entity70 , highlights what psychologists refer to as a " diffusion of responsibility " -- a diminished sense of individual blame when a person acts as part of a much larger group			1
" when people are told by the leadership of a group to do something , and lots of others are doing it as well , people feel less guilt in doing it , " he says in reference to the hyper - partisan " us versus them " culture of @entity83			1
" in fact , they might feel more guilt if they do n't follow orders			1
" people in every corner of the country are disgusted			2
@entity2 ' approval ratings are abysmal -- hitting a record low of 14 % in an august @entity1 / @entity103			1
ca n't we all just get along ? or at least not inflict pointless pain on ourselves ? @entity107 's campaign slogan was " @entity108			2
" but the sad truth is -- no we ca n't			0
at least not judging from @entity2 ' performance since the midterm elections			1
there are a number of explanations for @entity2 ' behavior			1
none of them bodes well if you 're hoping for more cooperation among @entity0 's power brokers			2
some experts say this year 's repeated @entity83 showdowns reflect a political culture where the vital center has collapsed			1
@entity127 , legislators known as liberal @entity6 and conservative @entity5 roamed the halls of power			0
those days are pretty much gone			0
today 's congressmen and senators -- particularly on the tea - party - infused @entity6 side of the aisle -- are more fearful of primary than general election challenges			1
growing numbers of federal elected officials are more worried about tending to a political base screaming for radical change than appealing to independent or crossover voters			2
this is especially true in the @entity143 , where districts are drawn with scientific precision to be overwhelmingly @entity5 or @entity6			0
now more than ever congressional elections are a general election incumbency racket			0
the @entity6 landslide of 2010 ? eighty - five percent of @entity143 incumbents won another term , according to the @entity152			0
and that was the lowest percentage since 1970			0
the changing rules of the political game have policy consequences			2
congressmen seeking a long political career are probably better off catering to the wishes of their party 's most extreme activists , not some vaguely defined middle - of - the - road voter			1
" some @entity6 are ideological purists , " said @entity163 , a political science professor at @entity164			2
but " others are running scared , fearful they could lose a primary challenge to a more extreme candidate			0
" second , for all the talk of a growing independent electorate , there 's evidence that voters themselves are more polarized			2
the rise of a more partisan , fragmented media may play a role in this development			0
more choice in news may be good , but it often comes at a cost of viewers and readers seeking affirmation of their opinions rather than a challenge to their world views			0
in that kind of an environment , analysts note , elected officials are more likely to be punished than rewarded for compromising with the other side			2
third , a growing number of congressmen and senators -- especially those backed by the tea party -- are ideological true believers			2
if economic damage is inflicted by repeatedly taking the country to the brink , it may be seen as unfortunate but necessary in order to start turning the country in the right direction			1
" there 's a surgery metaphor here , " says @entity66			2
" i have to cut you open to get the cancer out			0
and any surgery has risks			0
" @entity212 , a @entity213 political scientist , says that " the fight now is really about dismantling the @entity215 and the @entity216			2
it is about finishing what @entity218 promised to do , but never really accomplished			0
" @entity212 argues that " there is a genuine belief among tea party @entity6 that if you shut the government down , all the non-essential things that the federal government does go away , but the essential things -- such as @entity228 and defense -- keep flowing			1
so you strip the federal government to its bare essentials and see how it runs			2
" tea partiers , @entity212 says , " may be hoping that the @entity9 people actually accept a stripped - down federal government , and the pendulum on federal spending finally turns their way			0
of course , as in ( the government shutdown of ) 1995 , that can backfire and simply remind voters how much they need most of what the federal government provides			1
" fourth , some congressional republicans may be calculating that a disgusted , alienated electorate is more likely to blame the incumbent party when they go to the polls in 2012			0
and while @entity6 control the @entity143 , the incumbency label is usually tied to the party that controls the presidency			0
" people are more unhappy with the @entity6 than with the president , " @entity66 says			0
indeed , only 33 % of @entity9 held a favorable view of the @entity6 in an august 5 - 7 @entity1 / @entity103 survey -- a lower favorability rating than that for either president @entity107 or the @entity5 as a whole			0
but a lot of congressional republicans " believe they have to do whatever is necessary to get @entity107 out of office " and bring about major change , @entity66 argues			0
" it 's to their benefit to be able to communicate that government is stalled , inefficient , and unable to do anything on the average person 's behalf , " he says			1
" so they may decide that they 're willing to take a hit in public opinion right now if they think @entity107 will end up taking the hit in 2012			0
" do members of @entity2 feel a sense of guilt for engaging in behavior that may be adding to the country 's economic woes ? " they may very well feel guilty or conflicted , " @entity66 says			1
" no matter what they say publicly , it 'd be hard to imagine the folks in @entity2 who are taking this approach and forcing these repeated confrontations are n't feeling somewhat conflicted if the result is some form of economic pain			1
" but any sense of guilt is likely mitigated -- particularly on the @entity6 side of the aisle -- by the creation of " shared strategy " and " sense of mutual confidence " for rank - and - file members , @entity66 claims			0
@entity66 also argues that there 's a degree of separation between @entity83 and the rest of the country that makes it easier for some congressional officials to take steps that may be exacerbating the country 's economic pain			1
" you 've got to work hard to convince people that the economic hit they just took is the direct fault of @entity0 , " he says			0
" they may draw a connection between @entity0 and the broader economic outlook in the country , but they rarely tie @entity0 to their personal financial situation			1
as for members of @entity2 , he adds , burning ideological imperatives can trump reports of economic distress among people they do n't know and interact with rarely -- if ever			1
if the prognosis is grim , it may be worth remembering a line from that old congressional critic , @entity323			0
" we cuss @entity2 , " @entity323 said			1
" but they are all good fellows at heart , and if they was n't in @entity2 , why , they would be doing something else against us that might be even worse			1

@entity2 is threatening the third potential government shutdown this year
the political *turmoil* may be contributing to the country 's economic *problems*
congressmen believe they may benefit from the repeated showdowns , analysts say
