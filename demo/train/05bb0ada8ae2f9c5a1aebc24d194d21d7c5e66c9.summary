-- dear @entity1 , @entity2 is here			1
i know you will once again be wondering why @entity5 does n't come home from work			2
i know this makes you sad			2
it makes me sad , too			2
i want to see you			0
i want to help you dress , brush your teeth and drive you to school			0
i want to take you outside so we can tend to your garden of tomatoes and peppers or ride your bicycle			0
since the last time we were together , i am sure you have gotten better at applying the brakes			0
i bet next time i see you i wo n't have to keep yelling " pedal backwards ! pedal backwards ! " i am writing this letter to explain to you why my work takes me away from home for so long			0
you may not understand everything i 'm saying now , but i hope one day you will			0
i work in @entity26 in @entity27			1
this country looks like heaven , but for too many people here , it feels like hell			1
there is stunning natural beauty , but it seems like so many of its 77 million people are simply trying to survive			0
their daily life is defined by extreme poverty , sickness and constant fear of marauding militias of men who roam the country molesting women and kids with impunity			1
@entity1 , my job is to try to make life better for mommies and kids			1
women in @entity26 , as they do in so many countries , work farm fields , bring home firewood , fetch heavy buckets of water , cook for the entire family and take care of all the children			1
even though women do that work , they earn very little money and are often treated very badly			1
men receive the money earned by women			1
men decide how it is spent			1
much of the time , men do n't even listen to what women and girls have to say about how the family money is spent			1
women are excluded from many of the family 's most important decisions -- even decisions that directly affect their own lives			2
i try to help women and girls in @entity26 go to school , visit the doctor and earn money so they can take care of themselves and their families			1
i got into this line of work because when i look back on my own childhood in northern @entity90 , i realize that i could 've easily been one of those people that organizations like @entity93 are trying to help			0
to help women and girls , i spend much of my time speaking with and educating men			1
just as men here have the power to make life very difficult for girls and women , they also have the power to support the girls and women around them			1
we are most successful helping daughters and mothers when sons and fathers are working alongside us			2
we talk to husbands about the community - wide benefits of supporting girls ' education and their wives ' efforts to save money and start small businesses			2
we show men how violence undermines the families and communities they value			2
i like to remind men that the women they can help lift from misery and despair are their mothers , aunties , daughters and sisters			1
i also tell them that being a responsible man requires being respectful of everyone			0
manhood is not about physical strength or the power to bully others			0
rather , it is working to make society better for everyone , including women and girls			1
that is a lesson still being learned not only here in the @entity26 but also there in the @entity143 and the rest of the world			1
when you grow up to be a man , @entity1 , you will have a right to be free and make decisions for yourself			0
but you should not take rights away from girls or women			2
robbing a girl or women of her rights is like robbing yourself			2
when a man takes away a girl 's right to go to school , he is taking away a girl 's right to do what she wants when she grows up -- her right to be a doctor , engineer , pilot , teacher , nurse or university professor			0
he is robbing his community of her talent and contributions			2
work for the freedom of others , @entity1			0
@entity178 is like a boomerang			0
what you throw into the world comes back to you			0
i 'm sorry i wo n't be home for @entity2 or to open the card you made for me at school			1
but i 'm proud to be part of a movement of men working with women around the world to make sure everyone -- regardless of gender -- is treated with dignity and respect			1
i may not come home in a uniform , but please know that our family 's sacrifice is for the most important struggle of our time			0
i know it makes you sad today , but i hope one day it inspires you to help others			0
i am so looking forward to spending future @entity207 with you			0
and watching as you grow into a good man			0

@entity211 : son , i *'ll* be gone for @entity2 , working to help women in @entity26
he says life there is hell for many , particularly women who are *vulnerable* to attacks
he aims to educate men that respecting all , including women , *uplifts* the community
@entity226 : son , when you are grown , you must treat everyone , including women , with dignity
