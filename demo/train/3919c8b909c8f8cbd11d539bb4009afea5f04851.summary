-- a year ago , the @entity2 @entity1 struck down a key section of the @entity4 or @entity4 , a 1996 law that recognized legal marriage as being between a man and a woman			1
the june 26 , 2013 , ruling in @entity9 afforded equal federal rights and protections to married same - sex couples			1
the ruling made a huge difference for binational gay couples			1
with @entity4 gone , @entity2 citizens and permanent residents could sponsor their same - sex spouses for residency in the @entity2			1
before , many same - sex couples had to make an agonizing choice between love and country when a temporary visa for one of the partners expired			1
@entity0 spoke with four such couples before and after the historic ruling			1
read how they are doing a year later : @entity30 wins in gay couple 's 40 - year immigration fight d - day early last june , @entity34 , 37 , and @entity35 , 47 , were pondering their options : start a new life in @entity34 's native @entity39			1
or maybe @entity40 or closer to home in @entity42			2
but they could n't stay in @entity44 and raise their child as a legally married couple			1
they counted down to february 20 , 2014 , the day @entity34 's @entity2 visa was set to expire and she 'd have to leave the country			1
the date hung like a thundercloud over their heads			2
" it was @entity33 for us , " @entity34 says			2
but a year ago on june 26 , things brightened			1
not long after the @entity1 ruling , @entity34 and @entity58 got married in @entity60 they immediately filed a petition with @entity62 for permanent residency or a green card for @entity34			1
@entity34 gave birth to a daughter in november and no longer fears being separated from @entity58			1
" there 's no reason it should not go through , " @entity58 says of their petition			2
" i 've changed enough dirty diapers to know how real a family we are			2
" the couple runs a small business that helps nonprofits with fundraising and grant writing			2
after the @entity4 ruling , they breathed a sigh of relief and were able to devote more time and energy to building their company and raising their daughter			1
" it pretty much changed everything for us , " @entity58 says			2
@entity34 no longer looks at a calendar with dread , and february 20 came and went without fanfare			1
in fact , they did n't even notice			2
coming home @entity99 , 36 , abandoned his law career in @entity101 and moved to @entity102 to be with his fiance , @entity103 , so they could remain together			2
@entity103 , 32 , is @entity105 and his temporary @entity2 work visa had expired			1
@entity99 grew angry that he had to leave his own country to be with the one he loved			2
he says he was forced into exile because he is gay			2
" as an @entity2 i felt torn , " he says			1
" on the one hand i love my country dearly , but on the other i deeply resented that we were pushed out rather than afforded the dignity we deserve			0
" the @entity1 ruling came more than two years after they left @entity101			1
@entity99 and @entity103 are getting married in october			0
after that , they can think about moving back to @entity2			1
" for the first time in almost 10 years of us being together , we 're finally in control of our own destiny , " @entity99 says			0
they are planning a trip to @entity101 in july and will test how it feels to be back in @entity2 together			1
then , they will have to decide where they want to live out their lives			0
" making those decisions wo n't be easy , " he says			0
" but we 're grateful that for once , the decisions most meaningful to us get to be ours to make			2
" ' persons non-grata ' no more like @entity99 , @entity134 , 48 , left home to be with her love			0
she once worked as an executive for @entity138 , drove a @entity139 and lived in a three - bedroom house in sunny southern @entity141			2
she gave it all up so that she could live with her wife , @entity143 , 46			0
the two were married in @entity143 's native @entity145			0
it took them almost a year , but the two moved back to @entity2 in late may			1
at the @entity149 airport , they faced an immigration officer they 'd encountered on a previous occasion , when they 'd taken off their rings and walked through not as a family , but as individuals			0
they had always been afraid that because @entity143 only had a temporary tourist visa , immigration authorities might suspect her as someone who might overstay her visa to be with her @entity2 partner			1
but this time , they proudly wore their weddings rings and presented their passports as a married couple			0
" thank @entity170 for ms. @entity9 , " @entity167 says of @entity9 , the plaintiff in the @entity4 case the @entity1 heard			1
" the ruling validated us as people , which is ridiculous because who needs to be validated by anybody ? " @entity167 says			0
" until that day last year , we were second - class citizens			1
now we have the same rights as anyone else			0
" @entity167 and @entity143 have been staying with relatives in @entity181 , but they plan to return to @entity182 , @entity141 , and pick up the life @entity167 so loved			0
the @entity1 also invalidated @entity141 's 2008 voter - approved constitutional ban on gay marriage , otherwise known as @entity186			1
so @entity167 and @entity187 will be recognized as legally married by the state as well			0
last week , the couple found out that the tenant in @entity167 ' house is leaving sooner than anticipated			0
@entity134 and @entity143 got married last year on june 26 , the day of the @entity4 ruling			1
they hope to move back into their house on thursday -- exactly a year later -- when they will be celebrating a double anniversary			2
married but single the week after the @entity4 ruling , @entity199 and @entity200 left for their honeymoon			1
@entity199 , 30 , and @entity200 , 31 , live in @entity204 , @entity205			0
but they were among the first seven couples to get married in @entity199 's native @entity208 after the state voted to allow same - sex marriage in late 2012			1
on their honeymoon , they visited @entity212 and witnessed the first same - sex marriages taking place after @entity186 was no more			1
then they went on to @entity216 and @entity217			0
a hotel where they stayed had champagne waiting for them			0
that 's something most straight newlyweds expect , but for @entity199 and @entity200 , it was a new gesture			0
back in @entity205 , their marriage is not recognized			0
at tax time , they found themselves in a dilemma			0
" by state standards we are single			0
by federal standards we are married , " @entity199 says			0
beyond the headache came the issue of the signature on the state return			0
how could they say that all the information they had listed was accurate when they felt they were lying about their marital status ? " i signed it as a single , " @entity199 says			0
" but that 's not true			0
so for me , it was a difficult ethical question			2
i did lie on the form because the state required me to			0
" on the upside , like all other binational same - sex couples , @entity199 and @entity200 no longer have to consider @entity42 as an option after @entity200 's student visa expires			1
he is @entity255 , and after he gains permanent residency as a spouse , he will be able to obtain a job here			0
the best thing , they say , is they can live like any other couple			0
not yet in @entity205 , but somewhere in the 19 states that now recognize same - sex marriages			1
follow @entity0 's @entity265 on @entity266			0

a year ago , the @entity1 struck down the @entity4
that opened doors for binational same - sex couples to say in the @entity2
some dreaded visa expiry dates ; others were forced to leave @entity2 to stay together
with @entity4 gone , they no longer have to make difficult choices
