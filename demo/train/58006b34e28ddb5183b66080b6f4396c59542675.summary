-- despite @entity4 's command to her twin daughters to just " spit it out , " neither @entity1 nor @entity2 were interested in speaking much on the " today " show thursday			1
the 13 - year - old twins , who became famous as kids on the @entity11 reality show " @entity12 , " appeared on the morning show along with their mother for an interview with " today 's " @entity16			1
the segment was supposed to be a chance for the twins to elaborate on the conversation they sparked with @entity20 last week , in which they said their lives are pretty normal for having grown up under the lens of reality tv			1
the only problem was that neither twin wanted to speak up during the awkward sit - down -- instead , they glanced around at their mom and each other			1
visit @entity31 for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy when @entity16 asked @entity2 what she would say to the world about how her family is doing in their post-reality life , she was met with an " um " and a long pause			1
@entity43 jumped in with instructions : " @entity2 , your words , " she said			1
" it 's your chance			0
" when that did n't work , @entity16 tried to get a response from @entity1 , who was just as quiet			1
" this is their chance to talk , this is the most wordless i 've heard them all morning , " @entity43 told @entity16			0
" i do n't want to speak for them			0
" after some coaxing and a few more lengthy silences , @entity2 piped up to speak for her sister			1
" a lot of people think that filming our show has damaged us , " she said			0
" but it 's only really helped			0
" the original series , " @entity12 , " ended in 2009 along with @entity12 and @entity4 's marriage			2
@entity4 soldiered on with another reality show , " @entity12 , " but that ended up getting canceled as well			2
aside from the occasional celebrity weekly story or own interview , @entity43 , @entity12 , and their brood -- which includes their 9 - year - old sextuplets , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- have mostly faded from view			2
but with the cover of @entity20 's january 20 issue , @entity1 and @entity2 step back into the spotlight to correct any misconceptions the public has about their family			1
" people expect us to be damaged , " @entity1 said , as her sister chimed in that others " think we 're supposed to be so messed up , like , ' ooh , the poor @entity4 kids , they 're going to be scarred for life , waaaaah			1
' here 's the big news : we 're not messed up			0
" " it 's so false , " @entity1 said			2
we 're better than ever , actually			0
" those words are likely a relief to anyone who caught the " today " interview and wondered why the two were so quiet			2
according to @entity4 , any press that they do are things that the twins agree to do			0
" it 's really frustrating when there is so much out there that is not true , " she told @entity16 thursday			0
" we know the truth , and that 's why they 're here , even though they 're tongue - tied this morning , to say , ' hey , we 're ok , we 're doing well			0

@entity4 and daughters @entity1 and @entity2 appeared on " today " thursday
the segment was supposed to be about how well - adjusted the family is
instead , it was an awkward interview as neither twin spoke much
@entity4 had to *encourage* her daughters to " spit it out "
