-- if you book hotels online , it 's time to face facts : your favorite travel website probably is n't cutting it			0
in the past decade , some of the best - known travel sites have lost their fastball			0
they 're not as smart and nimble as the new kids on the @entity11 that now have tools for smarter comparison shopping , searches for smaller b&bs and niche neighborhoods , and access to blocks of rooms reserved for its members			0
before you try these , one word of caution : no single site is the be-all - and - end - of - all of hotel booking			2
we recommend using at least two search tools , such as your current favorite online travel agency and one of the hotel shopping engines we 've named here , to max out your chances of nabbing the perfect room or upgrade			1
happy shopping ! @entity36 best for : travelers who like the idea of hotel owners competing for their business			1
what it does : hoteliers often hold back a handful of rooms to sell to last - minute guests , but they do n't always fill them			0
you can book one of these rooms as they 're released by logging on to @entity36 , which enables hotels to sell rooms to travelers who already have confirmed bookings at rival properties			1
how it works : book a refundable reservation at a hotel through your favorite website , and then create a free account at @entity36			1
forward the email with your confirmed hotel reservation to the site , and it will shoot your reservation details -- minus your credit card information -- to dozens of hotels at your destination			2
@entity36 will then share with you any counter-offers rival hotels may make , such as a comparable room at a lower rate			2
@entity72 best for : travelers who want an independent source to vouch for the honesty of vacation package prices			1
what it does : many hotels tout packages that include perks , such as valet parking and a spa treatment , claiming that the package prices represent deep discounts over buying the components separately			2
@entity72 vets each package for its true value			1
how it works : use @entity72 to pick a hotel package at your destination , then click on the listing for a breakdown of the estimated costs of the package 's components			1
( the site even publishes a list of the " worst " hotel deals			2
) @entity0 : 12 elevators you need to see to believe @entity102 best for : travelers who prefer staying at independently owned properties			1
what it does : founded this year , @entity102 lists more than 50,000 @entity108 hotels , motels , @entity110 , and guesthouses , scraping listings off countless websites			2
( a @entity115 version , hotelsweep.co.uk , does the same thing for lodging in the @entity115			0
) one of the perks of the site is that it lists mom - and - pop properties -- places that generally aim to attract budget - conscious travelers , but are too small to afford the costs of being listed with multinational travel agencies			1
how it works : punch your destination into @entity102 's " direct hotel search " tool , and the site will fetch a quick - and - dirty list of properties , which you can sort by nightly rate or distance from a particular location			1
a @entity137 image of the property is provided , but it 's up to you to take the next step and contact the managers and book a room			2
if that is too much work , @entity102 also has a " live price comparison " tool , which is a standard booking engine powered by @entity147 , an @entity148 rival to @entity149 , though it does n't include all of the mom - and - pop listings that turn up in the " direct hotel search " tool			1
@entity153 best for : culture vultures and nightlife fans who want to stay in the buzziest neighborhoods			0
what it does : previously a metasearch site for airfare , @entity153 last year added hotels to its repertoire			0
one of its signature tricks is to allow a traveler to name his or her favorite interest , such as nightlife , shopping , and museum - hopping , and the site will filter its listings to only display hotels in neighborhoods with an especially high number of relevant venues , such as bars , boutiques , and museums			0
how it works : run a search for a hotel like you would on any travel site , and @entity153 retrieves real - time rates from booking sites , such as @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , and vacation rental platform @entity192			1
@entity153 also assigns an " ecstasy " rating to each hotel , based on an evaluation of the property 's rates , amenities , and user reviews on @entity201			2
@entity0 : 15 food etiquette rules that might surprise you @entity205 best for : travelers booking hotels overseas who have been disappointed by the selection on @entity108 - based travel agencies			0
what it does : in 2010 , @entity205 , moved beyond being a flight metasearch engine and now lists hotels from major overseas hotel booking sites , such as @entity216 and @entity217 , which tend to be overlooked by @entity108 - based travel sites like @entity219			2
it also includes an option to search for hostels			0
how it works : like @entity149 , you enter your search query , and the site draws up a list of rates from various online travel agencies and hotel sites			1
room 77 best for : travelers whose priority is a room with the most amenities			1
what it does : room 77 is unique in researching room - by - room amenities and floor plans for hundreds of three - to five - star hotels in about 30 @entity242 , @entity243 , and @entity245 cities			1
it then facilitates booking a particular type of room			0
how it works : room 77 works like a typical hotel search engine , only it goes into much greater detail about the amenities available in individual rooms at hotels , such as what the view might be from any given window			1
guests who book directly through @entity238 can take advantage of its free " room concierge " feature , in which it contacts hotel managers on a guest 's behalf to request a room matching his or her preferences , such as " connecting rooms " and " distance from elevators			2
" there are no guarantees , but the site claims that its customers have a high satisfaction rate with its concierge service			0
@entity0 : 21 girl trips you absolutely love @entity280 best for : travelers who prefer the consistency and quality control of @entity108 - owned chain hotels , and do n't want to be distracted with information about other places			1
what it does : seven hotel chains -- @entity303 , @entity290 ( @entity290 , @entity290 ) , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 ( @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 ) , @entity297 , and @entity298 ( @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 ) -- are listing their rooms together in a new search engine			1
unlike major online travel agencies like @entity219 and @entity307 , @entity280 limits its selection to chains , eliminating most of the uncertainty about what kind of hotel you might end up with			0
how it works : punch in your destination and travel dates and the site brings up a list of relevant hotels , which you can winnow down using the standard tools , such as distance , price , and star rating			0
when you decide to book , you 're sent directly to a hotel owned website , where you 'll need to enter your credit card number to book the room			1
booking directly with the hotel cuts out the middleman and earns you customer loyalty points			0
@entity332 best for : travelers looking mostly for @entity242 business - type hotels			0
what it does : finds the cheapest rooms at major - brand hotels located at @entity108 's largest airports and financial districts -- and nearly nowhere else			0
how it works : this consolidator has access to rooms at a volume discount with major brands like @entity292 and @entity297 at most major @entity108 airports ( especially @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , and @entity353 )			0
by only allowing members to see deals , the site is able to offer rates much lower than major chains and websites with lowest - price guarantees offered to the general public			0
