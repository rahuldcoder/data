-- as a jockey he spent his career guiding horses over the world 's toughest fences			1
but this -- standing in a ditch in a @entity10 town with a young boy in a ragged rodeo outfit holding the reins of his blind pony -- is an altogether different assignment for @entity15			2
the boy is the son of the local rag - and - bone man , who collects unwanted items and sells them to merchants			2
@entity19 is there to take pictures for the @entity22 , a @entity24 - based animal charity , in his new career as a photographer			1
it 's in stark contrast to 27 years ago when he burst onto the horse - racing scene aged 22 , riding @entity31 to victory in @entity24 's @entity33 , a grueling jumps test widely regarded as the hardest and most spectacular event of its kind			1
@entity19 , who turned 50 in january , may have stepped out of the saddle some years ago but horse racing still drives his passion and thinking in this relatively new - found career			1
he was advised by his doctor to give up the racetrack because of the dangers to his already damaged neck should he fall heavily again			2
" it 's a bit like a quote from my friend @entity47 ( the 18 - time champion jockey with over 4,000 wins to his name ) who likes to say whatever you do , if you 're riding a winner , remember you might not ride another one , " @entity19 told @entity0			1
" it 's the same with photographs			1
you take a good image and then it 's on to the next one			1
" i think that horse - racing mentality i had while riding translates well to acting as a driving factor in photography			0
" the career path from saddle to camera lens is not a well - traveled route , but photography has always been a passion for @entity67			1
" at school , i was always in the dark room and doing stuff like that , " he recalls of his youth in @entity69			0
" then during my career i had a lot of friends who were racecourse photographers and sports photographers , so i got more interested then			1
" after retiring he started heading up riding holidays for travel company @entity79 , which took him on trips around the globe for five or six years			1
he featured in " @entity82 " -- the @entity24 tv show that spawned " @entity84 " globally -- walked 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours for charity , and retraced the steps of explorer @entity87 as part of a 48 - hour trek to reach the @entity91			1
" after all that , i felt i wanted to get about more but wondered what would enable me to do that , " he adds			0
" i thought taking photographs might be a good way of combining the two			0
" so , he signed up to a nine - month course at the @entity98 in @entity99 specializing in photojournalism , which he says " really taught me a hell of a lot			1
" asked if he has always had a natural eye , he says laughing , " i would n't say that ! " but he has produced a gallery 's worth of eye - catching photographs from his various trips , not least of all his first exhibition in january for the @entity22			1
the charity wanted to highlight its work and the plight of suffering animals by sending @entity19 to some of the 10 countries where it has projects			1
" i was quite surprised how well it was received , " he says of the exhibition			0
" you do n't really know how you are , you can never gauge yourself , it 's how the images are received by other people			1
i 'm just stumbling around trying to make a living from this			0
" one memorable trip was to @entity128 in october , which @entity19 made independently from the charity			1
" i always felt safe there , but you never know , " he says			0
" there was a restaurant we frequented a fair bit while we were there which was blown up by a suicide bomber last month			0
it makes you think , does n't it ? it 's very sad what 's happening there but i loved it as a country -- it 's a fantastic place really			2
" other assignments have included covering the @entity146 -- an energy - sapping 1,000 - kilometer horse race -- trips to the brick kilns in @entity151 to watch children work , slate mines in @entity154 and a visit to @entity156 , a city perched in the highlands of @entity10			0
there are further photographic trips planned , notably one to @entity160 later this year , and he hankers for a return to the @entity162 and @entity163			2
" i went there before i 'd done my course but it 's just the most beautiful place to take photographs , " he says			2
" we came across a polar bear which i caught on my tiny ready - to - shoot camera , and the pics were ok			0
i 'd like to go back with proper equipment			0
" @entity19 , whose time is split between @entity172 and living with his girlfriend near @entity174 in @entity175 , still ca n't believe he has gradually forged a second career for himself from his passion			1
as for his former colleagues , he has no idea what they make of his photographs -- " when i see them we never really talk about that " -- and he is too modest to rate his own photographs			0
" i 'm happy with one or two of my photographs but it 's not up to me to say , that 's for other people , " says @entity19 , who concedes he is best at action shots			1
" i 'm just very grateful for this chance and the places it takes me			0
" so what makes a good photo ? " i 've had a few lectures on this subject from some top photographers , " he says			2
" it has to be a good moment , a defining moment , something that makes you look twice , as there are so many images out there now			0
it 's hard to get one of those eye - catching shots			2
" in fact , photographs are a lot harder work than they are given credit for , certainly than i used to give credit for			0
i have an immense amount of respect for photographers			0
" but he is certainly happy in his new life , which has taken him from in front of the lens to behind it			0
" i prefer taking photos of horses than being on them , " he says			0
" certainly at the @entity146 , where the ponies rear up and it 's all a bit crazy			2

*ex-jockey* @entity19 *swaps* saddle for photographic snapshots around the world
a passion for pictures and travel led him to retrain and learn the art form in @entity99
there 's an equine theme to his pictures after a *partnership* with animal charity @entity22
@entity19 was one of the top jockeys in an *illustrious* career cut short by *injury*
