@entity1 , @entity0 -- voters dealt major blows to @entity0 's two most established parties in parliamentary elections sunday , leaving no party with anything approaching a majority and the politically and economically volatile nation even more in flux			1
with 97 % of votes counted early monday by the @entity13 , the right - leaning @entity14 -- part of the present ruling coalition -- finished first with 19 % support to capture 109 seats			1
that figure is barely half the percentage that it won in elections in 2009 and well short of what party leader @entity22 admitted it hoped for entering this weekend			1
" i asked for a strong mandate , but people chose differently			1
i respect their message , " @entity22 said in remarks carried live on state television			0
" today 's result expresses people 's disappointment towards the implemented dead - end economic policy that tested their limits and did n't include the necessary development policy			1
" in an apparent backlash against austerity measures , no party came close to a majority , and the two parties that spearhead the current coalition government earned far short of 50 % of all 300 parliamentary seats			1
that means a new coalition government will again have to be formed			0
politicians have until may 17 to come up with a new working alliance or , if they can not , set a date for another round of elections			0
@entity22 acknowledged the results were disappointing to his party , but said that as the first - place finisher and " only pillar of political stability in @entity0 , " @entity14 now has even more responsibility			1
if a coalition government can be formed , he said its two priorities would be to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies , including stringent austerity measures , to " achieve development and offer people relief			1
" " i understand people 's rage , but i will not let the country ( exist ) without a government , " @entity22 said			2
the other party to see its support plummet was left - leaning @entity70 , @entity14 's coalition partner			1
three years after beating out all other parties with 44 % of the vote , @entity70 took 13.3 % this time -- giving it 41 spots in parliamentary , compared to 160 after the previous election			2
@entity70 's leader , @entity77 , said in a speech carried on state tv that he favored the formation of a unity government that is " @entity82 - oriented , regardless of what their take is on " previously implemented measures			1
the tribulations of @entity14 and @entity70 were matched by triumphs of a number of other parties that were also - rans and in some cases nonexistent just a few years ago , propelled by voters angry about stringent austerity measures			1
elections in @entity96 : @entity97 wins @entity99 presidency the radical leftist coalition @entity100 passed @entity70 with a strong second - place showing			2
exit polls predicted it would garner 10 % support , but instead @entity100 garnered 16.7 % support , according to the all - but - final results			2
that more than triples its parliamentary representation to 51 seats			0
" this is a message of a peaceful revolution , " said @entity111 leader @entity110			2
" @entity96 leadership and especially ( @entity116 chancellor @entity115 have to understand that austerity policies have suffered defeat			2
" the fourth - place finisher , the independent @entity0 party , was founded in february by ousted @entity14 parliamentarian @entity121			1
with 10.6 % backing , this right - wing nationalist party , which opposes @entity0 's agreement with the @entity82 and @entity124 , will now have 33 seats in parliament			1
the @entity128 , which wants @entity0 to leave the single - currency eurozone , also saw gains in winning 8.5 % support			2
and the far - right @entity131 , which got 0.3 % of votes the previous election , ended up with 7 % support on sunday			2
that equates to rise from zero to 21 parliamentary seats			0
its leader , @entity137 , gave a rousing speech after sunday 's vote saying @entity131 would " fight so that @entity0 wo n't be a slave of the memorandum and of the social jungle that illegal immigrants have brought in this country			1
" " everyone who betrays @entity147 should be afraid			1
we are coming , " he said			0
@entity149 , financial editor of the @entity0 daily newspaper @entity151 , called what happened sunday " a protest vote ( against ) the main two political parties of @entity0			0
" yet @entity149 added that she expects @entity14 and @entity70 again will be part of the ruling coalition government , even though there may be notable policy changes and challenges to come , including a " renegotiation " of already approved austerity measures			1
" i believe that these electoral results ... show that people need a coalition government , " she said			0
" they also want the parties to cooperate			0
" one young mother interviewed by @entity2 said her aim sunday , before the voters were counted , was to " punish " pro-austerity politicians and " get rid of them for good			0
" austerity is " the wrong path , " said the woman , who did not give her name			0
" austerity measures just make people poorer and the situation does not get any better in the long term or in the short term either , " she said			1
but another voter at the same polling station said politicians have been doing the right thing			0
" we do n't have an alternative , " he said , saying he backed " whichever party actually understands that and wants to deal with it and wants to take these hard measures			1
" he also did not give his name			0
the country 's national debt threatened to force it to drop @entity96 's common currency , the euro , prompting the @entity196 and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding last year			0
in exchange , they demanded that the government slash spending brutally			0
austerity measures already enacted have led to cuts in jobs , wages , pensions and benefits , and have negatively affected many people , especially pensioners and those who get state assistance			1
taxes have gone up and the national unemployment rate for january , the latest month for which figures are available , was just under 22 %			0
among 25 - to 34 - year - olds , it was nearly 29 % , leading many young people to leave the country in search of work			0
furthermore , for the past two years , the country 's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17 - country eurozone			2
@entity0 pushed through a huge debt swap in march to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the @entity82 , the @entity196 and the @entity124 , worth â ‚ ¬ 130 billion ( $ 171.5 billion )			0
the debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc , where fears that @entity0 might collapse had increased pressure on other debt - laden nations such as @entity238 and @entity239			0
but the outcome of sunday 's vote raises fresh questions as to whether @entity0 will stick with the painful path of austerity			2
@entity2 's @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report .			0

no one party comes close to a majority ; established parties suffer setbacks
@entity14 finishes first , though it 's leaders say it did n't win a " strong mandate "
several parties see their support soar , *fueled* by those upset with austerity measures
a far - right party leader says , " everyone who betrays @entity147 should be afraid "
