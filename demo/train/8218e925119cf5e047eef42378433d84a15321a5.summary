-- in a sporting world where the big boys invariably grab all the glory , there is one competition where the romantic notion of the underdog toppling the giant sometimes becomes reality			1
not often , but regularly enough to keep seemingly hopeless dreams alive			0
the @entity11 is soccer 's oldest knockout competition , and while it is often won by the greatest teams in the @entity16 it is also the source of some of the greatest upset results			1
" when you are a football club you dream of playing at @entity21 , and today we saw the underdogs play with incredible bravery , incredible belief and they defied the odds again			0
that 's the @entity11 , " said @entity27 after his @entity29 team made their dream come true with a shock win against @entity32 on saturday			1
it was a result that ranked with @entity36 's 1988 victory over @entity37 and @entity39 's 1976 upset of @entity40			0
when @entity29 lined up against @entity32 at @entity21 , @entity42 's national stadium , there could not have been two more contrasting teams			1
city -- funded by the oil money of its @entity47 oil owners , winner of the @entity16 last season and the @entity11 the one before that -- up against a @entity29 side in its first final , having been a top - flight club for less than a decade			1
@entity29 's team cost Â £ 11 million ( $ 17 million ) in transfer fees -- @entity32 's squad had 11 players who had individually cost more than that			1
even before @entity58 completed a reported $ 300 million takeover in 2008 , @entity32 was already an established football name , even if its fortunes had faded since the 1960s and ' 70s			2
neighboring @entity29 , on the other hand , was a non-league club until 1978 and only started moving up the divisions when entrepreneur @entity66 bought it in 1995			2
@entity66 was a former footballer who played in the @entity11 final for @entity69 in 1960 , but badly broke his leg as his team lost , and never featured with a top team after that			1
he subsequently made his money with a chain of grocery stores and then got into the sportswear business			0
now 76 , he is an institution in the north - west town , having owned its rugby league team while also funding the football club 's stadium -- which was first named after his business and is now known by his initials			2
a sometimes controversial figure -- a backer of the conservative party , he was the only leading football figure to call for a minute 's silence to honor the late former prime minister @entity90 -- he has presided over a club that has battled to stay in the @entity16 for the past few seasons			1
" what an incredible story , " @entity27 said after an injury - time header from substitute @entity94 earned a shock 1 - 0 victory over @entity32 , who had @entity98 sent off for a second yellow card in the 85th minute			1
" the chairman broke his leg in 1960 and today , finally , it 's finished business for him			0
" @entity66 was given special dispensation to lead out the team , as @entity29 played its second major final -- having lost in the 2006 @entity106 in @entity107			1
but now , although @entity27 's team is guaranteed @entity113 football next season , @entity29 's chances of staying in the top division hang by a thread with just two matches to play			1
the @entity116 , as they are known , occupy the third and final relegation place and will have little time to celebrate the club 's greatest day as tuesday brings a trip to @entity121 contenders @entity122			2
" we are going to get an incredible fight , incredible desire , to get the six points we 've got left , " @entity27 said			0
" but today is about today , today is about the @entity11 , today is about the victory and the trophy that we 've won for @entity29			1
" @entity27 has been widely linked with a move to @entity132 following the imminent departure of @entity134 to replace @entity135 at @entity40 , and was last year one of the candidates to take over at @entity37 before @entity138 got the job			0
he is highly rated by @entity66 , who has stood by the 39 - year - old despite a seemingly constant @entity142 act in keeping the club in the @entity16 , but it remains to be seen whether @entity146 's owners will show the same patience with their manager @entity148			2
the @entity149 cut a forlorn figure at @entity21 after the defeat left his side without a trophy this season , having been second best in the league as @entity40 won back the title			0
@entity135 's surprise announcement this week that he is retiring after more than 26 years in charge took much of the focus off the @entity11 final , but the buildup to the match came with widespread rumors that @entity148 will be replaced by former @entity165 coach @entity164 , who guided @entity166 to the @entity121 quarterfinals this season			1
@entity164 revealed on saturday that he and several players would be leaving the @entity171 club at the end of this season due to its money problems , which have resulted in a ban from future @entity113 competition under @entity178 's financial fair play rules			2
" everyone would prefer to stay but unfortunately , the circumstances we are in do n't allow that , " the @entity179 said			0
@entity148 helped @entity32 end a long wait for a trophy when he won the @entity11 in his first season in charge , but saturday 's defeat could be the end of the road for the 48 - year - old after a difficult season in which he sold problematic striker @entity193 -- who he had signed in 2010 from his former club @entity194 -- and failed to make it past the group stage in the @entity121			1
" this speculation is rubbish			0
if i said it 's rubbish , it 's rubbish ... speculation and rubbish , " he angrily told @entity199 match broadcaster @entity200			0
@entity148 said he was " very sorry " for the 40,000 @entity32 fans who traveled to @entity206 for the match , which was played in pouring rain			2
" they scored in the last minute so for us it was difficult			0
but we did n't play very well -- i do n't know why , " he told @entity213			0
" it was a difficult season because our target was to win the @entity16 , and we did n't win it			0
but this can happen , it 's impossible to win always			2
" and after we had this chance to win another cup ... this moment is difficult			0
" earlier saturday , @entity221 became @entity223 's all - time leading scorer with both goals in a 2 - 1 victory over @entity226 that all but ensured the @entity206 side will play in the @entity121 next season			1
the 34 - year - old @entity42 midfielder has yet to be offered a new contract by the club , but he gave owner @entity232 food for thought as he passed @entity236 's longstanding mark of 202			2
the win put third - placed @entity223 five points clear of @entity122 and six ahead of @entity239 , who both have a game in hand			1
@entity226 took the lead through @entity245 's 19th league goal this season but the @entity247 was sent off after the halftime break			1
@entity223 had lost @entity249 for a second booking before the break , but @entity221 fired in a left - foot shot on the hour and finished from close range with nine minutes to play to take his tally to 15 this season in the @entity16 and 17 overall			1
however , defender @entity257 and midfielder @entity258 were taken off with injuries and are battling to be fit for wednesday 's @entity261 final against @entity262			2
meanwhile , @entity40 midfielder @entity263 announced on saturday that he will be retiring for the second time			0
the 38 - year - old quit in 2011 but was persuaded to return by @entity135 the following year			0
he has not played since january , but @entity135 confirmed that the former @entity42 international will make his 498th @entity16 appearance on sunday at home to @entity269			0
" he will collect an unbelievable but well - deserved 11th @entity16 medal , " @entity135 said ahead of his own final home match at @entity271 .			0

substitute @entity94 heads the only goal in the first minute of time added on
@entity32 reduced to 10 men when @entity98 is sent off in the 85th minute
