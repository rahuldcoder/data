-- it 's the townhouse that twists like a @entity3 's cube , to bask in the summer sun and shield itself when winter bites			1
welcome to the transforming @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , where a normally static facade has been replaced by an adaptable , modular living space			1
not content with luxury touches including a swimming pool , gym and cinema space , the seven - floor mansion has been designed to incorporate three rotating blocks that turn 90 degrees and transform the interior and exterior space			0
the design was grounded in need rather than luxury , say @entity8 - based studio @entity23 , the architects behind the new building			1
temperatures in @entity9 can rise above 40 degrees @entity27 ( 104 degrees @entity28 ) or plummet well below freezing			1
traditional @entity9 houses cope with these extremes by incorporating an airy living room for summer and a separate , cosy living room for winter months			1
in the @entity37 's house , after its owner -- rooms are transformed at the touch of a button			1
in the " open " mode , the three blocks pivot outwards on their rotating base , pointing the windowed ends to the sun , which also creates a terrace on each floor			2
" closed " mode hides the windows to keep the house warm during @entity8 's snowy winters			0
the original design -- which @entity53 , lead designer at @entity23 , claims also references traditional @entity9 houses -- has earned the firm a nomination at the @entity56			1
inside the house , two basement floors provide fitness facilities and " wellness areas , " explains @entity53			0
above a ground floor garage space and living quarters for a housekeeper , the top four floors comprise the home 's communal areas			0
the two lowest moving " blocks " form a breakfast room and guest bedroom , while the upper block will be an office			0
creating the rooms to turn on demand was no easy feat , say the architects			2
they puzzled over the interior handrails -- eventually redesigning them to fold as the rooms rotated			0
the turning mechanism for the rooms was , they say , the least of their worries -- the mechanical bases were already in use elsewhere -- as rotating sets in theaters or platforms for cars in showrooms			2
for the @entity91 , the building will now go up against @entity93 houses styled to become live - in plant pots , a concrete beach hut in @entity96 designed to withstand northern @entity98 's tropical storms , and a @entity100 villa that rises tree - like out of above its surrounding vegetation			0
