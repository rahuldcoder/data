-- while @entity2 may still deck the halls and stuff the stockings this @entity5 , a new poll finds that the state of the economy is playing a major role in how @entity2 will celebrate it in 2013			1
according to the @entity0 / @entity10 poll , @entity2 plan to curtail their @entity5 gift giving and charitable contributions due to economic concerns , while a sizable minority of @entity2 , 37 % , report that the economy will make the @entity5 holiday more stressful			1
sixty - one percent of respondents said they had to cut back on their holiday donations this year due to the economy , according to the poll			1
that number is up from 2009 , when 51 % said they would be giving less to charity , and from 2010 , when 58 % said the same			0
similarly , 62 % of @entity2 said they were cutting back on their holiday gift giving this year			1
the economy looming large over the holiday season has become a trend since the economic downturn and recession of 2008			2
and this latest poll shows that even though 2013 brought welcome -- albeit slow -- economic growth , the recession still seems to have lingering effects on how @entity2 feel about @entity5			1
in 2005 , before the economic downturn , nearly half of all @entity2 said that @entity5 was a " great time " or " the best time " of year			1
in 2008 , just months after the financial crisis hit , that number was down to 43 %			0
and in the most recent poll , only 42 % said @entity5 was the best or great time of year -- a sign that @entity5 spirit has yet to fully recover from the recession			2
what 's more , this year a record low of 11 % of people said @entity5 was " the best time " of year			2
these numbers comes despite the fact that by looking at most objective economic indicators , the last year has seen positive economic growth -- including falling unemployment , growing gross domestic product and a soaring stock market			0
even if @entity5 giving and spending will be scaled back , the more than nine in 10 @entity2 who say they will celebrate @entity5 this year , plan to celebrate the holiday differently			1
according to @entity0 's polling director @entity56 , those who celebrate @entity5 can be categorized in four different groups : twenty - five percent of @entity2 are in the " @entity59 " group , meaning they go all out for the holiday			1
this includes putting up @entity5 trees , lights and other decorations outside their homes			0
they also consider @entity5 the best time of the year , and according to other polls , they go to church weekly			0
next are the 32 % of people who look forward to celebrating the holiday but may not go all out			2
members of this group -- the " @entity71 " -- are religious , according to other polls , but are not weekly church attendants			0
twenty - three percent of @entity2 are " @entity74 " about @entity5 , meaning while they like @entity5 , they are n't wild about it			1
they likely do n't decorate and they are the most likely group to limit what they eat during the holiday season			0
only a quarter of this group attends church regularly , according to other polls			0
lastly are the 16 % of @entity2 who fall under the " @entity83 " group			2
this group says the holiday season is a bad time of year for them and they do n't spend much time or effort on the holiday			0
only 6 % of @entity2 said they will not be celebrating @entity5 this year			1
the telephone survey of 1,035 people was conducted for @entity0 by @entity10 on december 16 - 19			0
the poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .			0
