a deadly gun attack on the @entity2 satirical magazine @entity1 has shocked @entity2			1
and while no one has yet claimed responsibility , a history of threats over the magazine 's controversial coverage of @entity10 fueled immediate speculation that @entity10 extremists were to blame			1
adding weight to that suspicion is video taken by a journalist for the @entity17 news agency which showed the gunmen shouting " @entity20 ! " ( @entity21 for " @entity22 is great ! " ) as they began the attack			1
they also shouted , in @entity2 , that they were avenging the prophet , according to @entity27 prosecutor @entity26			1
if the attackers are confirmed as @entity31 extremists , it will be the latest tragic example of the growing threat posed by radical @entity10 in @entity33			1
@entity2 , which has the largest @entity35 population in @entity33 and an interventionist foreign policy , has already been at the sharp end of such violence			0
just last month , two attacks were carried out in the space of a weekend , apparently motivated by @entity31 extremism			1
in one , a 20 - year - old @entity2 - @entity42 posted the @entity44 flag on his @entity46 page , then entered a police station in the @entity50 suburbs , shouted " @entity20 " and wounded three police officers before a fourth shot him dead			1
a day later , a 40 - year - old @entity2 - @entity53 with a long history of psychiatric problems shouted the same words as he plowed into pedestrians in @entity59 , injuring 11 people before being arrested after a police chase			1
the deceased @entity50 knife attacker -- a convert named @entity63 -- appears to have been a lone wolf inspired by but not directly connected to @entity44			0
according to @entity2 media reports , his brother had been on the radar screen of @entity2 security services , suspected of wanting to wage jihad in @entity71			2
in march 2012 , @entity72 , a self - styled @entity73 jihadist , killed seven people -- including soldiers and @entity77 children -- in a series of attacks in the southwestern city of @entity81			0
@entity2 extremists have also been active beyond their country 's borders			2
@entity85 , a @entity2 accused of the deadly shooting at @entity88 's @entity87 in may , recently spent a year in @entity71 and is a radicalized @entity31 , according to @entity2 officials			1
prosecutors say that when police arrested @entity85 in @entity2 , they also seized a @entity93 rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the @entity44 insignia			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity96 said last month that his country had never faced a greater terrorist threat			2
nearly 400 @entity2 extremists are fighting alongside jihadist groups in @entity71 and @entity101 , according to @entity2 officials last month , with more on their way			1
meanwhile , 234 have left the conflict zone , with 185 now back in @entity2			0
@entity2 police say they have thwarted five terror plots since the summer of 2013			0
@entity107 officials say the threat of terrorist attack in the @entity110 is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in @entity71 and @entity101 , according to @entity3 terrorism analyst @entity113			1
but no country faces a greater terrorist threat than @entity2 , he said , with support for @entity44 running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the run - down , crime - ridden banlieues , or suburbs , that surround many @entity2 towns			2
adding fuel to the fire , @entity2 joined the @entity127 - led coalition against @entity44 last year			0
the @entity2 military is also involved in fighting @entity31 extremists in the @entity53 nation of @entity131			1
following the expansion of the coalition bombing campaign into @entity71 , a senior @entity44 leader for the first time called for attacks against @entity33 citizens			0
he specifically urged lone - wolf attacks in the @entity127 and @entity2 -- two countries that had already been conducting airstrikes against @entity44 in @entity101			0
and the group singled out what it called " the spiteful and filthy @entity2 " for punishment			0
@entity145 , head of @entity33 analysis at @entity147 , said that while it was too early to be sure who was behind wednesday 's attack , the range of potential suspects is limited			2
" neither anarchists nor the extreme right would have an obvious motive to target the magazine , and intimidation or extortion by organised crime would be highly unlikely to take the form of such an attack , " she wrote in an analysis			2
" on the other hand , @entity163 has explicitly threatened to attack @entity2 citizens and @entity73 may also have the motivation			2
" the risk of such an attack has increased since @entity2 joined the coalition against @entity44 , she wrote , adding : " @entity2 has a long history of jihadist militancy , while exclusion of migrants , @entity2 foreign policy and domestic secularism are all drivers of radicalisation			2
" a @entity127 counterterrorism official told @entity3 that @entity127 counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups as possibly being responsible , including @entity182 , @entity44 , and core @entity73			0
@entity184 has also been a target in recent years of violent attacks by @entity31 extremists			1
in may 2013 , a soldier was killed in the street in southeast @entity190 in a bloody attack by two converts to @entity10 who ran him down with a car before attacking him with a machete			1
they are both now serving long prison sentences			0
cell phone footage replayed in court showed one , @entity201 , still clutching a meat cleaver in his bloody hands , ranting that the killing was " @entity205 , a tooth for a tooth " for @entity184 soldiers killing @entity35 overseas			0
@entity184 raised its terror threat level to severe last summer			2
and @entity184 home secretary @entity211 , outlining new counterextremism policies in november , highlighted the threat posed by extremists returning from @entity101 and @entity71			1
more than 500 have traveled there from @entity184 , she said , joining " thousands " from other @entity107 and @entity33 nations			0
" when the security and intelligence agencies tell us that the threat we face is now more dangerous than at any time before or since 9/11 , we should take notice , " she said			1
going farther back in time , the july 2005 bomb attacks on @entity190 's public transit network left more than 50 people dead and hundreds more injured			0
the four men who carried out the attack were @entity35 , one a convert			2
@entity228 's public transit system , too , has been in the sights of suspected @entity31 extremists			1
in 2004 , the bombings of commuter trains killed 191 people and injured 1,800			0
@entity10 militants with possible ties to @entity73 were designated later as the prime suspects			1
the @entity237 has also been impacted by extremism			0
in 2004 , @entity237 director @entity239 was stabbed to death by a member of a radical @entity10 group after his short film " submission " used verses from the @entity245 written on women 's bodies to criticize the treatment of women in some @entity10 cultures			1
newspapers in @entity252 and @entity253 prompted furious demonstrations around the world in 2005 when they ran cartoons depicting the @entity257			0
any depiction of @entity10 's prophet is considered blasphemy by many @entity35			1
despite , or perhaps because of , the rising tensions , @entity1 -- which also satirizes @entity260 and other faiths -- also published cartoons of @entity257 , spurring protests and the burning of the magazine 's office three years ago			1
its last tweet before wednesday 's attack featured a cartoon of @entity44 leader @entity271 and the words , " and , above all , health			2
" @entity2 president @entity274 appealed for national unity wednesday as @entity2 confronts perhaps the worst terror attack ever seen on its soil			2
but he made no bones about calling it a terror attack and said the country 's security alert level had been boosted as police hunt the gunmen			1
" we knew that we were threatened like other countries in the world , " he said			0
" we are threatened because we are a country of freedom			0
" @entity27 - based security expert @entity290 described the attack as " obviously an act of war			1
" and he warned that it was probably only the first in the current climate , with others still to come			2
@entity297 , a @entity2 political scientist , told @entity3 that the attack was an assault on some of the nation 's key values : a free press , democracy , transparency			0
but while it 's shocking , he said , at the same time he was not surprised			0
" there was an expectation in @entity27 , a fear , that an attack was about to occur			1
police officers were saying it 's not whether an attack will take place but when , that is the only question , " he said			0
" and of course @entity1 was one of the likely targets of the terrorists			1
" @entity2 can expect strong support from its @entity107 neighbors as it hunts those responsible			0
" this is an attack on all of us , on our fundamental values , on the freedoms our # @entity110 societies are built upon , " @entity321 vice president @entity320 said on @entity322 via a spokeswoman			0
@entity330 chancellor @entity329 and @entity184 prime minister @entity331 also gave their backing			0
" we stand with the @entity2 people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press , " said @entity331			0
@entity1 : satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy @entity3 's @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 and @entity345 contributed to this report			1

attackers shouted that they were avenging the prophet , @entity27 prosecutor says
security officials have warned of a rising threat from @entity31 extremists
no responsibility has been claimed for the attack on @entity1
but it has in the past been subject to threats over its coverage of @entity10
