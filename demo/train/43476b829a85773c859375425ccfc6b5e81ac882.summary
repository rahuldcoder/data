-- squash , the bridesmaid of racquet sports , will hope to finally recognize its @entity4 dream after winning a place on the shortlist of candidates to be included at the @entity8			1
while tennis , table tennis and badminton have long been on the @entity4 agenda , squash has failed to impress the @entity14 during its previous attempts , with campaigns to be included at @entity17 and @entity18 2016 falling on deaf ears			1
but wednesday 's announcement by the @entity14 means it , along with wrestling and the combined baseball / softball bid , will have the chance of securing the one final place in september 's vote			1
there is the offer of a reprieve for wrestling , which was dropped from the program in february , while baseball and softball were axed after the @entity33 but have since streamlined their competitions in order to win back favor			2
wrestling had long been considered an iconic @entity4 sport having been part of the @entity8 since its inception in 1896 and missing out just once -- at @entity42 in 1900			2
both freestyle and @entity44 had been mainstays of the @entity4 , but this year 's shock decision led to the sport 's chief @entity47 resigning as president of the @entity50			2
golf and rugby sevens are two new sports to be included at @entity18 next year and squash is now hoping it will finally make its debut in 2020			1
" this is a great day for squash as it takes us one step closer to realizing our long - held ambition to join the @entity4 , " @entity58 's seven - time world champion @entity57 said in a statement following the announcement			1
" i said to the ( @entity14 ) @entity67 that the one big regret in my career is that i have never had the chance to compete in the @entity4 , but i would happily trade all my seven world titles for the chance of @entity4 gold			1
" hopefully that showed what competing in the @entity8 means to me			0
it was a true honor to play a part in our presentation and i will do everything i can as we head towards @entity82 to help our campaign			0
" squash will now hope to succeed where the likes of wushu , wakeboarding , roller sports , karate and sport climbing failed , missing out on contention for consideration			0
the sport has tried to make itself more attractive to the @entity14 , using all - glass courts , video review systems and a white ball to help make it more spectator - friendly			0
" @entity102 would grow all over the world with the @entity14 , " @entity100 president @entity99 said in a statement			0
" we are a growing , global sport played in 185 countries by millions across the world			0
" we offer the genuine prospect of new nations on the medal podium			0
we would be easy and low cost to integrate into the @entity4 with just 64 athletes , two competition courts that can be built in days and we have a great track record of being hosted in iconic locations			0
" i think all these elements were important considerations for the @entity119			0
it is critical now that we build further momentum and support ahead of the @entity14 member vote in @entity82 on september 8 , and this is what the global squash family is completely focused on			1
" the @entity14 uses 39 criteria to decide which sports make it through to the @entity8 , with categories such as popularity , good governance and respect for the @entity4 values all taken into consideration			1
@entity14 president @entity134 , who is set to step down in september following a 12 - year term , told reporters he was impressed with the presentations put before the 14 board members			1
" the @entity67 received excellent presentations today from eight @entity140 , " he said			0
" it was never going to be an easy decision but i feel my colleagues on the board made a good decision in selecting baseball / softball , squash and wrestling to be put forward in @entity82			2
" i wish the three shortlisted sports the best of luck in the run - up to the vote in september and would like to thank the other sports for their hard work and dedication			2
