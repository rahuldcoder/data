@entity0 -- the @entity3 tried to find loopholes in the @entity5 for its " ghost detainee " program in @entity7 and to delay the release of @entity11 prisoners to avoid bad press , three human rights groups contend			1
the @entity3 considered delaying the release of detainees from @entity11 because of criticism			1
@entity3 documents discuss @entity18 and @entity3 detention activities earlier this decade and indicate coordination between agencies in hiding internees from the @entity22			1
@entity23 , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity26 , and the @entity27 obtained the material through a @entity30 request and released it thursday			2
" it 's obvious that defense officials engaged in legal gymnastics to find ways to keep detainees off the books , " said @entity31 , faculty director of the @entity24 and @entity26			0
" a full accounting of all agencies ' responsibilities must now take place to ensure that these abuses do n't continue under a different guise			0
" president @entity44 has signed an order closing the @entity11 detention facility in @entity47 and prohibiting @entity18 prisons			1
however , the order allows the @entity18 to detain people temporarily			0
it is not known whether the @entity3 or the @entity18 still holds " ghost detainees , " @entity31 said , referring to people housed at secret facilities			1
the @entity3 issued an information paper may 28 , 2004 , on the " applicability of the @entity5 to ' @entity57 ' in @entity7			1
" its purpose was to clarify the law about such detainees			0
the @entity5 spell out international humanitarian law and authorize the @entity22 to visit prisoners during armed conflicts			0
the @entity3 's information paper said that if " absolute military security " requires it , the conventions permit the holding of persons " who participated in activities hostile to the security of the occupying power			1
" specific examples would be " spies and saboteurs , " the paper said			0
although the @entity22 must be notified of such detentions , " persons who have committed such acts are considered to have forfeited the rights of communication , " the paper said			2
" normally the @entity22 has the right to go to all places where protected people are detained , " the paper said			0
but , it added , such visits can be denied temporarily " for reasons of imperative military necessity			2
" a february 17 , 2006 , e-mail showed that a @entity93 foreign policy adviser urged the @entity3 to consider delaying by a month and a half the release of @entity11 prisoners who were scheduled to be sent home in order to avoid bad press			1
this came amid worldwide furor over the @entity11 detention facility , photos of prisoners being mistreated at the @entity105 in @entity7 , and sharp criticism on the streets and in blogs toward @entity110 detention policies			1
" we may need to definitely think about checking with @entity115 to see if we can hold off on return flights for 45 days or so until things die down , " the adviser wrote to gen. @entity112 , then head of the @entity113			0
" otherwise we are likely to have hero 's welcomes awaiting the detainees when they arrive , and we will have problems getting overflight and landing clearance for the flights anyway			0
it would probably be preferable if we could deliver these detainees in something smaller and more discreet than a t tail " -- apparently referring to a large transport plane like the giant @entity129			0
@entity115 is the @entity115 , the @entity131 military command covering @entity131 and the @entity132			2
@entity112 is now the @entity133 chief of staff			0
the letter appeared to be an e-mail reply to a @entity93 " hot issues " memo that said the @entity110 was getting " creamed on human rights " and " taking a big hit on the issues of human rights and respect for the rule of law			1
" it pointed to news stories about a @entity147 @entity11 report and coverage highlighting calls from officials to close @entity11			2
it cited criticism of the @entity110 in blogs and discussion boards			2
" @entity110 has lost its prestige , " a blogger from @entity156 wrote			0
" every year the world waits for the annual @entity93 report on human rights			1
today , it is @entity110 that awaits the world 's opinion of its human rights policy			1
from @entity11 , to @entity105 , to secret prisons in @entity167 , the world accuses @entity110 of not respecting human rights			1
" @entity3 spokesman @entity168 said thursday that he had not seen the documents and was n't aware of the story			1
he did elaborate on the factors taken into account when transferring detainees from the @entity11 facility			2
" it has to do with their threat , " @entity168 said			0
" it has to do with ... whether or not we think they have information that is important to our intelligence efforts			0
" and there are also considerations given to ensure that the [ transferred detainees ] will be treated appropriately and that in cases where continued detention is necessary , that the appropriate conditions are met for that , too			2
" it has been @entity110 policy not to return detainees if we thought they would be mistreated by their country of origin , " he said .			0
