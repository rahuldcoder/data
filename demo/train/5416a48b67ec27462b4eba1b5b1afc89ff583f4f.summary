@entity11 , who recently went missing , was a member of the local parliament and belonged to the president 's political party			2
" the terrorists who basically have taken the entire @entity17 region hostage have crossed the line with torturing and killing @entity1 patriots , " @entity9 said			1

tensions remain high as pro-russian militants show no sign of preparing to leave occupied government buildings in eastern @entity1 despite an international deal agreed to in @entity107 , @entity108 , last week			2

@entity52 and @entity129 powers have urged @entity75 to use its influence to persuade protesters in the east to lay down their arms , leave the buildings they 're occupying and accept amnesty in line with last week 's deal			0
but @entity9 said tuesday that " unfortunately , the @entity23 and its terrorist special forces present in @entity1 are demonstratively not going to implement the @entity107 agreement			1
" he cited the seizure of a police station monday in the eastern city of @entity182 by militants who also took the police chief hostage , " thereby negating the agreements reached in @entity107			0
" @entity75 has said that it holds no sway over @entity26 protesters and militants			0
but @entity52 and the @entity45 dispute this			2

asking @entity23 to call for those occupying buildings to disarm and stand down , @entity214 said there was " mounting evidence that separatists continue to increase the number of buildings under occupation and take journalists and other civilians captive			2
