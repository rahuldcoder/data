@entity1 ( not his real name ) is two years old and lives in a shack that once sheltered animals			1
he arrived in @entity3 from @entity21 a few months ago			1
in @entity21 he lived in a nice home , in a nice area - full of middle - class comforts			1
but planes began to whirr through the skies and bombs began to fall in his region			0
the power supply diminished and the police disappeared			0
and , one day , a group of men came to the house and threatened his young sister			2
so , @entity1 was bundled up , packed into a car and set off to the border , where his mother carried him and his sister across to @entity3			1
@entity21 's forgotten refugees the family lost everything in @entity21 -- their house , their roots , and most of their loved ones			1
they followed in the footsteps of the only relatives who had already fled and moved into a large settlement of improvised homes , not far from @entity54 refugee camp near @entity55			1

they built up walls and covered holes with tarpaulin			0
there are now three rooms , with a family sleeping in each			0
i traveled to @entity3 with @entity8 to report on the growing catastrophe facing @entity21 children			1
i was surprised to find that three quarters of refugees are in @entity1 's situation and do not live in formalized camps			1

and -- perhaps most crucially as the temperatures hit 45 degrees - there is not enough clean water or sanitation facilities for everyone			2
with cholera epidemics most common in september , the threat of disease looms large in people 's minds			2

a dedicated plan to cater to the needs of urban refugees in northern @entity3 is currently being drawn up with partners including @entity137			1
but numbers are huge and expanding -- and there are not enough resources to go round and not enough funds to scale up existing programs			0
@entity8 has only a third of the money it needs for the year in order to deliver vital aid			2
