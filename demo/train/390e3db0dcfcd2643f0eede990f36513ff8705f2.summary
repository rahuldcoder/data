@entity0 -- angry members of @entity3 questioned top administration officials wednesday on why they were n't asked to authorize president @entity6 's decision to commit @entity8 forces to the @entity10 military mission			1
the question dominated a classified briefing by secretary of state @entity13 and defense secretary @entity14 for the @entity15 , according to @entity15 members who attended			1
a separate briefing for the @entity18 occured shortly afterward			0
other issues raised by the legislators included whether the @entity8 intended to arm the @entity10 rebels , and the cost of the mission to @entity8 taxpayers , participants told @entity1			1
@entity26 and @entity14 made clear that no decision had been made on arming the rebels , with @entity3 members from both parties saying they believed it would be a bad idea , according to participants			1
" i strongly oppose arming rebels because in that complex tribal patchwork that makes up this insurgency , it is very uncoordinated , " @entity32 rep. @entity32 of @entity33 told @entity1 , adding that @entity35 radicals were joining the @entity10 opposition			1
@entity41 sen. @entity41 of @entity42 said he wanted to help the rebels , but not with arms			2
instead , he called for aerial bombardment of @entity45 and his inner circle in @entity47 , the @entity10 capital , which @entity41 said would have more impact than sanctions and seizing overseas assets			0
" what they would worry about is having their compounds bombed by the most capable air force in the world , " @entity41 told @entity1			0
on congressional authorization , the @entity57 has said @entity6 acted within his authority under the @entity60 , noting that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run - up to the march 19 deployment of @entity8 forces to the @entity69 - authorized @entity10 mission			1
after wednesday 's briefing , legislators said @entity26 told them the administration acted within the requirements of the @entity60 and needed no congressional authorization for further decisions on the mission			1
@entity78 rep. @entity77 of @entity79 called @entity26 's response inadequate			1
" briefing @entity3 is not the same as authorization , " @entity77 told reporters			1
" @entity83 is nice , but authorization is required under the law			0
" other legislators expressed frustration			0
" i ca n't think of a time in our nation 's history where we put our men and women in combat like this without an administration of either party coming to the @entity3 first , " said @entity88 rep. @entity88 of @entity89			1
he repeated a @entity100 criticism that the administration worked harder to get @entity102 and @entity103 backing for the @entity10 mission than congressional support			1
" if they had time to consult with the @entity103 and they had time to consult with @entity102 , why in the devil did n't they have time to consult with us ? " @entity88 said			0
@entity32 said the briefing made clear that @entity3 should n't expect to be asked for authorization in the future			2
" the implication was very strong that they saw no need for any authorization at any time regardless of how long this were to continue , " @entity32 said			0
@entity78 rep. @entity119 , @entity120 , conceded that @entity3 is rarely satisfied with how any administration consults on such important issues			2
" you 'll never hear a congressman say they 've had enough consultation , " @entity119 said			0
he offered some details from the briefing , saying he expected @entity6 and @entity14 to use money already budgeted to the @entity130 this year instead of seeking supplemental funding that would require congressional approval			2
" that would be an easier way to do it , " @entity119 said			0
" if he has to get money through ( with a supplemental measure ) , that would set off a lot of debate			0
" @entity119 also said the mission had cost about $ 550 million so far , mostly due to the @entity8 tomahawk missiles fired and the loss of one jet fighter			0
the continuing cost would be about $ 40 million a month , he said			0
@entity77 said @entity14 convinced him that a massacre in @entity10 was imminent before the @entity8 - led coalition launched airstrikes to enforce a no - fly zone and prevent @entity10 leader @entity45 's forces from attacking the rebel stronghold of @entity151			1
" there was considerable evidence " of a pending slaughter , @entity77 said			2
" that was answered to me satisfactorily			0
" @entity77 also said @entity14 and @entity26 made clear there would be no @entity8 ground forces involved in the @entity10 conflict			1
asked if @entity3 supports the mission , @entity77 said he thinks there is " considerable " support for finishing it now that it 's started , but " that support will erode if it takes a while			2
" @entity1 's @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report			0
