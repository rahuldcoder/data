-- while most first - time visitors to @entity2 choo - choose to travel by train , consider the convenience of driving			1
behind the wheel you 're totally free , going where you want , when you want			1
when drivers come off a ferry in @entity11 or @entity12 , they usually see a sign warning them to drive on the left			1
driving in the @entity15 is wonderful -- once you remember to stay on the left and after you 've mastered the roundabouts			1
but be warned : every year i get some emails from traveling readers advising me that , for them , trying to drive in @entity11 and @entity12 was a nerve - wracking and regrettable mistake			1
here 's a tip : if you want to get a little slack on the roads , drop by a gas station or auto shop and buy a green " p " ( probationary driver with license ) sign to put in your car window			1
of course , in @entity11 and @entity12 you 'll be driving on the left - hand side of the road			1
why that side ? originally , it was in order for you to drive defensively ... with your " sword hand " on the inside to protect you against oncoming traffic			1
many @entity43 drivers find the hardest part is n't driving on the left , but steering from the right			1
your instinct is to put yourself on the left side of your lane , which means you may spend your first day or two constantly drifting off the road to the left			1
it can help to remember that the driver always stays close to the center line			1
not only will you be driving on the left , but you 'll also be using roundabouts , where traffic continually flows in a circle around a center island			1
these work well if you follow the golden rule : traffic in roundabouts always has the right - of - way , while entering vehicles yield			1
for some drivers , roundabouts are high - pressure traffic circles that require a snap decision about something you do n't completely understand : your exit			1
to replace the stress with giggles , make it standard operating procedure to take a 360 - degree , case - out - your - options exploratory circuit			2
discuss the exits with your navigator , go around again if necessary , and then confidently wing off on the exit of your choice			2
whenever possible , avoid driving in cities			2
@entity84 even assesses a congestion charge -- about $ 13 per day -- to drive in the city center ( see www.cclondon.com )			2
it 's best and less stressful to begin your driving experience away from big cities , so try renting your car in a smaller town			2
a pleasant scenario for a @entity11 itinerary would be to start your trip in a small town such as @entity96 , rent a car when leaving @entity96 , explore @entity11 at your leisure by car , then drop off the car in @entity101 , and take the train into @entity84 , where you can rely on the excellent public transportation system			2
outside of the big cities and the motorways ( freeways ) , @entity15 and @entity106 roads tend to be narrow			2
adjust your perceptions of personal space			2
it 's not " my side of the road " or " your side of the road			0
" it 's just " the road " -- and it 's shared as a cooperative adventure			0
in towns , you may have to cross over the center line just to get past parked cars			0
sometimes both directions of traffic can pass parked cars simultaneously , but frequently you 'll have to take turns -- follow the locals ' lead and drive defensively			0
on rural roads , locals are usually courteous , pulling over against a hedgerow and blinking their headlights for you to pass while they wait			0
return the favor when you are closer to a wide spot in the road than they are			0
do some homework before getting behind the wheel ; buy good maps and check various mapping web sites , including @entity141 's site and @entity142			0
a gps device can also be helpful			0
you 'll notice some differences between driving in the @entity106 versus the @entity146 ( @entity11 and @entity12 )			0
in the @entity106 , the speed limit is in kilometers per hour , road signs are usually bilingual ( but not always -- " geill sli " means yield ) , and roads are more likely to be bumpy and poorly maintained			0
in the @entity146 , the speed limit is in miles per hour , signs are in @entity153 ( except in @entity154 , where they are bilingual ) , and roads are generally in better condition			0
even if you do n't drive , as a pedestrian you 'll have to remember that among our @entity15 and @entity106 cousins ' many unusual habits , traffic comes from the opposite direction -- look both ways before crossing any street			0
horror stories about @entity15 and @entity106 traffic abound			0
they 're fun to tell , but driving here is really only a problem for those who make it one			0
the most dangerous creature on the road is the panicked @entity174			0
drive defensively , observe , fit in , avoid big - city driving when you can and wear your seat belt			0
