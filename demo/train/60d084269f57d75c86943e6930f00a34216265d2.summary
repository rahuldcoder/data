-- attempts to purge @entity3 from parts of the war - torn @entity5 have prompted " a @entity3 exodus of historic proportions , " rights group @entity1 warned wednesday			1
international peacekeepers have " failed to prevent the ethnic cleansing of @entity3 civilians in the western part of the @entity5 , " the group said			1
another rights group , @entity14 , also warned wednesday that the country 's minority muslim population is " being targeted in a relentless wave of coordinated violence that is forcing entire communities to leave the country			1
" the @entity5 , a former @entity21 colony , was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly @entity3 rebels dubbed @entity25 ousted president @entity26			1
they have since been forced out of power , but @entity30 militias , known as the anti-balaka , which translates as " anti-machete , " have been allowed to fill the power vacuum , @entity1 said , with dire consequences for @entity3 civilians			1
" @entity39 militias are carrying out violent attacks in an effort to ethnically cleanse @entity3 in the @entity5 , " said @entity36 , senior crisis response adviser at @entity1			1
" the result is a @entity3 exodus of historic proportions			1
" the @entity1 report said international peacekeepers in the country must do more to protect @entity3 communities and rein in the anti-balaka militias			1
there are about 1,600 @entity21 troops on the ground , alongside about 6,000 soldiers from an @entity54 - led peacekeeping force , known as @entity55			2
forcible expulsion the rights group also said the backlash against @entity3 civilians was foreseeable -- and should have been prevented			1
" in power for nearly 10 months , the @entity25 were responsible for massacres , extrajudicial executions , rape , torture , and looting , as well as massive burning and destruction of @entity30 villages , " it said			2
" as the @entity25 withdrew , the international forces allowed the anti-balaka militias to take control of town after town			0
the resulting violence and forcible expulsion of @entity3 communities were predictable			1
" for its report , @entity1 interviewed more than 100 people who witnessed attacks against @entity3 firsthand			1
the worst violence documented was in the northern town of @entity80 , where at least 100 @entity3 were killed in january , it said			1
among the dead were women and old men , including an imam in his mid- 70s			0
other northwestern towns where @entity88 communities have been attacked include @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , it said			0
the spiraling ethnic violence in the @entity5 has led some observers to fear another genocide like that seen in @entity96 nearly 20 years ago			1
@entity97 , head of the @entity99 refugee agency , said he has " witnessed in the @entity5 a humanitarian catastrophe of unspeakable proportions			1
massive ethno - religious cleansing is continuing			2
" he cited " indiscriminate killings and massacres " and " shocking barbarity , brutality and inhumanity			0
" he said he 's " deeply distressed that nearly half a million @entity5 have been newly displaced since december alone			1
in all , 2.5 millions are in desperate need			0
" he said the country is " falling through the cracks of international attention " and that ca n't be permitted			0
" tens of thousands of people are fleeing the country for their safety , many are trapped with nowhere to go			0
in @entity120 alone , thousands of people are in ghettos in grave conditions , " he said in a statement			0
he said the international community must act by deploying forces on the ground			0
" it is imperative to re-establish security , law and order			0
for the people of the @entity5 , safety and security for all is the most urgent priority , " @entity97 said			2
" acting in concert , particularly with the support of religious leaders , all actors must enhance mediation and pave the way for the restoration of peace and sustainable reconciliation			0
" @entity14 highlighted the language used by the anti-balaka militias -- which , it said , " suggests their intent is to eliminate @entity3 residents from the @entity5			1
" " at this rate , if the targeted violence continues , there will be no @entity3 left in much of the @entity5 , " said @entity147 , emergencies director at @entity14			1
" people whose families have peacefully lived in the country for centuries are being forced to leave , or are fleeing the very real threat of violence against them			0
" @entity14 cites the example of a gold trading center , @entity160 , which had an estimated @entity3 population of 30,000 and eight mosques before the conflict			2
when the group visited the town last week , fewer than 500 @entity3 and one mosque remained , it said			2
fled into exile the medical aid group @entity168 , or @entity168 , last week also warned of " extreme and unprecedented levels " of violence against civilians as @entity3 and @entity30 militia groups clash			1
" although the conflict is complex and all communities are affected by the violence , the minority @entity175 is increasingly targeted , " the group said in a statement			2
" in many towns , @entity3 groups are isolated and threatened by anti-balaka forces while tens of thousands of @entity3 have already left the country into exile in @entity185 or @entity186			2
" the @entity54 also raised concerns over violence toward @entity3 civilians and @entity185 nationals			2
the chief prosecutor of the @entity191 , @entity192 , said friday that she was opening a new investigation into serious abuse allegations			0
" in many incidents , victims appear to have been deliberately targeted on religious grounds , " she said support for peacekeepers a jointly penned column by presidents @entity201 and @entity202 , published monday in the @entity203 , said the two nations were working together to confront the crisis , as the @entity21 leader pays a state visit to @entity208			0
" in the @entity5 , @entity21 and @entity54 soldiers -- backed by @entity212 airlift and support -- are working to stem violence and create space for dialogue , reconciliation and swift progress to transitional elections , " it said			2
the @entity220 voted last month to continue its peacekeeping mission in the country and to authorize the use of force by @entity226 troops there			0
the decision came after the nation tapped @entity230 , mayor of the capital of @entity120 , as its interim president			0
she replaced @entity233 , the leader of the @entity25 rebels who seized power in march only to step down in january after failing to halt the escalating violence			0
last year 's coup was the latest in a series since the country gained independence in 1960			0
