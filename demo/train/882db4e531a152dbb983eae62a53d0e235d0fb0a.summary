instead , @entity120 repeated past language that the decision would be made within weeks			0

sen. @entity130 , the @entity132 @entity131 defeated by @entity10 in last year 's presidential race , said monday that @entity4 's re-election should encourage @entity10 to fulfill gen. @entity136 's request for up to 40,000 more troops			1
" the most urgent priority now is to support our @entity1 partners in reversing what @entity136 has rightly called the ' deteriorating ' security situation , " @entity130 said in a statement			2
" this requires a properly - resourced counterinsurgency strategy , and i urge president @entity10 to provide our civilian and military leaders with the resources they need to succeed			1
" the cancellation of the runoff " puts the election issue behind us , " but @entity4 has yet to achieve a true victory , according to the former @entity11 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity154			1

" " first , he does n't have much money left , " he said in the interview , which aired sunday			0
" second , i think that he thinks that given the situation , he 's likely to lose , and maybe he 'll get less votes than he did in the first round , so that would be embarrassing			0
