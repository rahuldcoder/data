-- @entity1 , a @entity2 antiques dealer in @entity3 , @entity4 , was excited about the possibility of buying a " top - notch , " genuine .36 - caliber @entity7 & @entity8 revolver that had belonged to a @entity10 officer from @entity11			1
a @entity13 woman who inherited the revolver from her late father sent him photos and , eventually , they agreed to a price , he said			1
" the purchase price we discussed was significant ... about double the annual salary i earned my first year out of college in 1979 , " @entity1 told @entity0 tuesday in an e-mail			0
" but the gun appeared to be in stellar condition , and i was anxious to buy it			2
" a day before driving down to @entity26 to finish the deal in late november , @entity1 said he thumbed through an old reference book that indicated a photo of the sidearm was courtesy of the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
@entity1 contacted @entity36 , collections manager at the museum , and by comparing photos and the piece 's serial number , they determined the revolver was a match with one stolen from the museum in 1975			1
now , thanks to the intrepid research and the @entity13 woman 's interest in doing the right thing , the gun should be back in the museum by february 1 , the museum said tuesday			1
the revolver belonged to @entity52 @entity51 , known with older sibling , @entity54 , as one of the " @entity56 " for creating all manner of gunpowder - infused weapons for the @entity10 during the @entity2 @entity51 , who early in his career did a stint on the faculty of the @entity62 , survived the war and lived into his 80s , dying in 1898			1
the @entity11 officer 's military trappings , including the prized revolver , were housed in the @entity32			1
in 1975 , the revolver , worth an estimated $ 50,000 today , was stolen			2
according to the @entity71 office in @entity26 , @entity69 had a @entity2 revolver that was in her late father 's belongings and she decided to seek an appraisal			1
after " substantial research " and learning the weapon 's history , @entity76 immediately decided to return the artifact to the museum , the @entity71 said in a news release			1
the six - round revolver was not @entity10 standard issue			1
instead , individuals would purchase such a sidearm			0
this particular @entity88 gun was one of about 1,450 made , probably in @entity90 , @entity91 , said @entity92 , who contacted the @entity71			2
" it was not terribly common , " she told @entity0			0
@entity1 said he considered the piece a " topnotch " version of that revolver			0
@entity92 , who has kept a short list of items stolen from the museum , said she got a call december 1 from @entity1 , who forwarded photos for the comparison			1
" there was a nick on the wooden handle that was exactly in the same place " as museum photos of the revolver , according to @entity92			2
@entity1 " was very instrumental " in the return of the gun , she said			2
the museum does not know who stole the item , although it does n't believe it was an inside job , @entity92 said			2
items were being transferred in 1975 from the original museum building to a new one when the revolver disappeared			0
" it was more of a rickety old case " the pilferer managed to open , she said			0
guards apparently were very trusting of people moving the artifacts , she said			0
@entity0 left messages tuesday for @entity76 , who @entity1 believes had no idea the item was stolen			0
" ms. @entity69 is to be commended for her ethical integrity , " @entity71 special agent in charge @entity131 said in the release			0
" by returning this artifact to the museum , ms. @entity69 has ensured that it will be preserved and treasured for generations to come			1
" @entity139 , a special agent with the @entity71 in @entity52 , said there was no formal investigation			0
" we are just a facilitator " in the revolver being returned to the museum			0
for his part , @entity1 is pleased he did n't spend a " small fortune " on the gun , only to lose it			0
" there 's no glory in having a piece of history that was stolen , " he said .			0
