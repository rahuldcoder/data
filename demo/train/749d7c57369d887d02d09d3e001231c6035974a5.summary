-- the @entity2 headlines last week sent a familiar shiver through me			2
in the 1970s , i ran one of the leading entertainment business public relations firms			1
celebrity clients were wildly indulging themselves , accountable to no one			2
it was money , power and prestige , with no one to say , " that 's enough			1
" drugs and alcohol were endemic			1
today , the conversation revolves around prescription drugs , but back then we were into more basic mind - altering substances : pot , psychedelics , cocaine and heroin			1
to be truthful , i had an amazing run before it all turned to garbage			2
my office , on the @entity29 in @entity30 , was set up like a huge living room with couches , overstuffed pillows on the floor , rock star posters lining the walls and a coffee table , the centerpiece of which was a large crystal bowl , filled at all times with a generous supply of cocaine			1
the house rules were " help yourself if you 're here on business -- but no take - outs ! " we were regularly visited by our clients , including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
as you could imagine , my office was a very popular place			2
but 29 years ago , i stood at the precipice with a decision to make			2
with a career of impressive accomplishments in the rear - view mirror , i had what looked like only despair and death ahead of me			2
alcoholism and drug addiction had rendered me into what the " @entity68 " of @entity69 refers to as " pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization			1
" the choice seemed simple			2
do i acknowledge i have a problem , or do i continue to live in denial ? do i listen to my friends and family , or do i seek my own counsel ? do i continue to deteriorate mentally and physically , or do i say , " i 've had enough ? " do i choose to live , or do i want to die ? if i once had a dream , i thought , it was long ago shattered			1
if i once had a dream , it 's floating face down in a bottle of @entity83			2
if i once had a dream ... ahh , screw it , i ai n't no @entity85 throwing in the towel and surrendering to admitting i had a serious problem should have been the obvious thing to do , given the state i was in			1
but at the time , change seemed impossible , unimaginable , incomprehensible and downright insane			2
insane was the right word , all right , but it described my state of mind			0
alcohol and drugs are subtle foes ; cunning , baffling and powerful			1
i seemed to be the last one to know i was in big trouble			0
when my high - profile career started to fall apart , it was other people 's fault			0
when my substantial income dried up , my business manager was to blame			1
when the beautiful house i so dearly loved was finally foreclosed , it was the bank that was screwing me			1
when she finally could n't take it anymore and left , i knew she was the type to do this to me			0
when my friends began to disappear , they were scum and did n't deserve me			1
and when , at last , my only friends , my drugs and alcohol turned on me , i knew it was over			1
and so a journey of unimaginable proportions began			1
not to any outward destination			0
no rehab , no trip to a far - off spa			0
i did n't move to another city , as if a geographic change would fix it			0
no , i did n't have to travel anywhere , except into the mirror , and by peeling the onion of my soul			0
the journey was within , to at long last discover where the real problem resided			1
it was , of course , in me			0
what a surprise -- with the loving help and support of a 12 - step program , i found the real culprit			0
we in recovery refer to alcoholism as a spiritual sickness			1
and if you look that up in the dictionary , you 'll find a photo of me			0
" mr. @entity148 of 1982			0
" if you ask me nicely , i might show you a picture of that lost soul that i still carry around in my wallet			1
yes , i had long hair and a beard , the smug look of false confidence on my face and even the obligatory turquoise jewelry of that era			0
but look more closely , and you 'll see in my eyes shallow pools of emptiness , pupils like pinholes from the daily consumption of narcotics			2
as a friend remarked when he saw the photo , " the lights are on , but nobody 's home			0
" after you shake your head in disbelief , and look up at me again wondering how this was possible and how i became such a different person , i will offer you an explanation			0
i 'm a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who was spared from a life of misery , incarceration and death			0
i 've been spared from the life of self - centeredness that led me to care very little about others and only about myself			0
i 've been spared from the countless fears of inadequacy , failure , success , intimacy and anything else that threatened my well - guarded defenses			0
i 've been spared a life of darkness and shown a path into the light			0
we do n't yet know why @entity2 died , but we know she struggled with addiction			1
it 's a pity that now , @entity2 will not have the option i had			0
follow @entity202 on @entity203 join the conversation on @entity205 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 says he easily could have died from addiction to narcotics , alcohol
he ran a famous rock star pr firm , with a large bowl of cocaine as centerpiece
@entity208 lost his house , business , wife , money , and blamed everyone but himself
he admitted the problem was inside himself and began his journey to recovery
