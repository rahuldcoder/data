in less than 48 hours , @entity0 has become a household name			2
the 11 - year - old @entity5 - @entity4 boy 's singing of the national anthem in his mariachi outfit caused a stir during game 3 of the @entity11 finals in his @entity13 hometown tuesday			1
on thursday night , the @entity14 decided to bring back " @entity16 " for an encore performance			2
even though he was the subject of racist comments on @entity20 , the @entity13 native was again wearing a mariachi outfit , according to @entity22 , corporate communications manager at @entity14			1
@entity22 had no comment on why the @entity14 decided to bring back @entity0			2
@entity0 was introduced by @entity13 mayor @entity24 , who stressed how proud he was by his talent and composure over the past few days			1
@entity24 said @entity14 coach @entity27 expressed disdain for the " idiots " who posted the bigoted comments and described @entity0 as a " class act " and " way more mature than most his age			1
" " to be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now i know the @entity14 like how i sing , " @entity0 said			1
" it makes me feel like i 'm doing something legendary			0
" @entity24 posted a response to the controversy on his @entity41 page			0
" i 'm proud of our young @entity13 superstar @entity0 for a spectacular rendition of our national anthem at last night 's @entity14 game			1
@entity47 , do n't let a few negative voices get you down			0
you are a true talent and you represent the best of our nation 's future ! " some might wonder if his encore rendition will attract more negative comments on social media			2
however , critics might be more cautious after what happened to @entity61 , a firefighter whose tweet caught national attention			0
according to an interview with the @entity67 newspaper in @entity68 , fire chief @entity64 said the firefighter " will be counseled for sure			0
" @entity70 's actions were " completely inappropriate and not acceptable " and " by no means are reflective of the @entity73 's attitude , " he said			0

@entity41 commenter @entity80 said that she had mixed feelings about @entity0 's performance because of his attire			2
those who were offended probably would n't have lashed out had he worn " slacks or khakis and button - down shirt / polo " instead of his mariachi outfit , @entity80 said			0
although the @entity4 has no true background and is made up of different ethnicities , she said , his mariachi outfit only represented @entity95 and one should have a " little taste when you 're singing the national anthem			1
" but it seems the support for @entity0 outweighed the criticism			0
actress and @entity104 native @entity102 said on @entity41 , " as a @entity5 , i am so proud of @entity105 , a great symbol of what @entity4 is today ! # @entity108 ! " @entity109 of @entity110 showed his support for the young mariachi singer on @entity20 : " i 'm sorry ... but slamming a kid for wearing a mariachi outfit while singing the national anthem is close - minded and bigoted ! ! ! ! ! ! " " you can love your heritage and love your country at the same time ! ! ! you can respect others culture as well a your own at the same time ! ! ! " " @entity16 " will make his way up to @entity123 this weekend for the second @entity123 @entity124 , where he will be singing in the national anthem competition			1
