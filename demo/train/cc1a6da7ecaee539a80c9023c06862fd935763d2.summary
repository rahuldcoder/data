december is all about defense for @entity3			2
the reigning @entity5 champions maintained their eight - match unbeaten run in all competitions with a 3 - 0 victory over @entity10 , saturday			1
@entity3 drew level on points with table toppers @entity13 , who will be eager to put daylight between themselves and the defending champions against @entity19 , monday			1
" december is a key month to be in the fight for the title , " city manager @entity20 told reporters after his side 's home win			0
" if you want to be involved you must be very near the top of the table			0
i hope we continue playing like this			0
it was a very good win , a very good performance			0
" @entity10 had frustrated @entity3 during the first half , coming close to scoring themselves , before mercurial forward @entity36 sparked into life after the break			1
the @entity39 broke the deadlock for @entity3 -- who are missing key strikers @entity42 and @entity44 -- when his shot deflected off @entity46 and past @entity10 keeper @entity47			1
@entity36 swept in a second soon afterwards before @entity49 drilled in at the near post to make sure of the victory for @entity3			0
their north of @entity55 neighbors and rivals , @entity57 , had to settle for a point from their away trip to @entity60			1
@entity57 had been on a six - match winning streak and would have expected more from their trip to @entity63 where they had not lost in 18 matches			2
@entity60 's talismanic striker @entity66 hit a curler into the corner to give the home side the lead after 18 minutes and deny @entity57 a magnificent seventh win			1
on - loan @entity73 striker @entity72 -- who played his first full 90 minutes after being given a place in the starting xi -- scored the equalizer in the second half when he headed in from close range			0
@entity60 were reduced to 10 men when @entity81 was sent off with 25 minutes still to play but the advantage did little for @entity57			1
" i 'm very frustrated , " summed up @entity57 manager @entity83 , whose side are third in the table and seven points off the leaders			1
@entity88 said @entity1 had come early as @entity89 scored his first goal for the @entity92 giants , saturday			1
the @entity94 ace , who joined @entity88 from @entity95 in a tasty $ 127m deal , had to wait until october to make his debut following his four - month biting ban			2
@entity89 finally got off the mark for his new employers in a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity102 , slotting in from close range to end his seven - game goal drought			1
@entity106 opened the scoring at the @entity108 , @entity105 headed in a third before @entity109 polished off the five - star performance with a brace			0
the victory saw @entity88 draw to within one point of league leaders @entity115 -- who are playing in the @entity118 final this weekend -- before the winter break			1
there was a nightmare before @entity1 for @entity122 in the @entity123			0
the @entity125 side slid to their 10th league defeat of the season , losing 2 - 1 to fellow strugglers @entity128 , and dropped to second from bottom in the table			1
@entity133 's side , who face @entity135 in the last 16 of the @entity136 in february , will have to wait until the end of january to try to contain their dismal domestic run			0
@entity140 head into the extended winter break sitting pretty at the top after a 2 - 1 victory against @entity144 , friday			2
@entity146 's side broke another @entity123 record for the fewest goals conceded in the first half of the season			0
@entity140 have conceded a miserly four goals so far			0
in the @entity155 @entity154 , champions @entity152 succumbed to the pressure again as they played out a goalless draw with mid-table @entity158			2
@entity159 can consolidate their place at the top of the table if they beat @entity163 , sunday			0
@entity152 had made an impressive unbeaten start to the season but are on a downward spiral after losing to @entity88 in the @entity136 and then lowly @entity167 in the league			2
at least footballers playing in @entity155 can put their feet up over the festive period and enjoy a 12 - day break from competition before the @entity173 swings into action .			0

@entity3 draw level on points with @entity5 leaders @entity13 after 3 - 0 win over @entity10
@entity57 settle for 1 - 1 draw away at @entity60 to stay third in table
@entity89 scores his first goal for @entity88 in a 5 - 0 win over @entity102
but there 's no festive *feeling* for @entity152 and @entity122
