-- i am an @entity2 , and i love my country , but i also love my heritage			2
i was born in @entity5 , @entity6 , to @entity8 - @entity2 parents , but 70 % of my family still lives in the @entity10 , including my grandparents , aunts , uncles and cousins			1
when i was 3 , my parents decided to move back to @entity16 -- a choice that changed the course of my life			2
the purpose of the move was for me and my siblings to learn @entity23 and our family 's culture			1
yet , the four - year experience offered much more than that			2
we lived peacefully in @entity29 , a @entity10 city just north of @entity30 , when we moved there in 1997			1
my father built a home in @entity33 , an @entity35 - controlled region of the @entity10			1
during the first two years , the @entity35 - @entity8 conflict was at a quiet period			2
our lives were pretty normal			1
my older brother and i attended a private school operated by the @entity2 education system , and my two older sisters went to a @entity44 all - girls catholic school			2
in our free time , our days consisted of shopping in @entity29 , taking cabs to @entity30 and hiking mountains			1
in the summer of 2000 , our lives were flipped upside down by the second intifada , or " the uprising			1
" a 20 - something - foot harsh concrete wall was constructed around the @entity10 , there were checkpoints installed between towns and villages , and daily clashes between @entity8 and @entity35 authorities interrupted our day			1
we no longer had the liberty to take cabs to @entity30 , shop in @entity29 or hike in the mountains			1
our sense of freedom was stripped away from us			2
my family soon discovered that living in fear and under occupation was dangerous and too hostile			1
so we decided to move back to the @entity2 in 2001			2
my family 's decision to leave was one that would thrust guilt on our shoulders for a time to come			1
leaving our extended family behind in a war - torn country left us with feelings of sadness			1
fearing daughter 's @entity78 border wedding living in occupation felt normal to me			1
it was moving back to @entity2 when i was 8 that felt like a culture shock			1
my life in @entity2 has been very different from my life in @entity16 and is much different from the lives of @entity35 and @entity8 youth today			1
going to school in @entity5 , my only morning worry was getting a decent grade on my homework			2
my cousins in the @entity10 , on the other hand , are worried about grades too , but they also have to worry about checkpoints and random clashes between the @entity8 and @entity35 authorities			1
the day the four children were killed while playing soccer on @entity100 , my friends and i were at @entity103 playing volleyball			2
unlike those children , we made it home safely to our families			0
as the conflict between @entity35 and @entity110 continues , the world is watching with eyes wide open			0
in the @entity2 , public opinion has been varied			0
@entity2 's opinion about the conflict is split between both sides : some support @entity35 ; some support @entity16			0
but for me , i have a different perspective of the conflict			1
when terror hit @entity2 on september 11 , i was filled with sadness , sorrow and anger			0
i thought , " how could someone do this to my people ? " the anger lingered for a very long time and still does today			0
these past couple of weeks have also made me angry			0
waking up every day , i would discover yet a higher death toll of @entity78 civilians			0
i would turn on the tv to find limbs of @entity8 plastered all over the news			0
sad and angry , once again i thought , " how could someone do this to my people ? " many @entity35 are also victims of terrorism			0
i understand the fear and frustration they feel due to the conflict			0
no one should have to mourn a loss of a human life due to violence			0
for those of you without ties to the region , i ask you to look at it with a fresh perspective : the history of the @entity153 and the politics go far back , but please look at the humanitarian crisis			2
think about the people instead			0
i think i speak for many @entity8 - @entity2 when i say i feel helpless in watching the continuous deaths of civilians in @entity16			0
my reason for writing this essay is to express my feelings about the conflict in order to help the @entity8 people -- my people -- in some way			0
before leaving @entity16 , i remember taking a walk with my mother in the hills of @entity29			1
on the bottom of the hills was the @entity10 barrier			1
once we reached the top of the tallest hill , my mother grabbed my arm and pointed in the far distance			0
" you see that city over there ? that 's @entity30			0
that 's where i was born , where your father was born and where you are from			0
one day , we 'll walk from here to @entity30			0
... and no wall or soldier will stand in our way			0
" i hope to see that day			0
