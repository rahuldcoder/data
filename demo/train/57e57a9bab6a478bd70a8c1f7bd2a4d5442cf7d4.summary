-- @entity3 , whose distinctive picking style and association with @entity6 cemented bluegrass music 's place in popular culture , died wednesday of natural causes at a @entity12 hospital , his son @entity1 said			1
" i realize his popularity throughout the world went way beyond just bluegrass and country music , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" it was more than that			0
" for many of a certain age , @entity21 ' banjo was part of the soundtrack of an era on " @entity27 of @entity28 " -- the theme song from the @entity31 sitcom " @entity28 , " which aired on @entity31 from 1962 to 1971 and for decades afterward in syndication			1
but much more than that , he popularized a three - finger picking style that brought the banjo to the fore in a supercharged genre , and he was an indispensable member of the small cadre of musical greats who created modern bluegrass music			1
@entity21 was born in 1924 to a musically gifted family in rural @entity44 , @entity45 , according to his official biography			2
his father , a farmer and a bookkeeper , played the fiddle and banjo , his mother was an organist and his older siblings played guitar and banjo , as well			0
@entity57 's exceptional gifts were apparent early on			0
he started playing the banjo at age 4 and he started developing his three - finger style at the age of 10			1
" the banjo was , for all practical purposes , ' reborn ' as a musical instrument , " the biography on his official website declares , " due to the talent and prominence @entity3 gave to the instrument			1
" while @entity21 ' status as the @entity72 of the banjo may be overstated , many musicians feel he changed the game			2
the late @entity75 , a noted banjo musician in his own right , was quoted in @entity79 ' " @entity78 's music : @entity80 , " as saying : " everybody 's all worried about who invented the style and it 's obvious that three - finger banjo pickers have been around a long time -- maybe since 1840			1
but my feeling about it is that if it was n't for @entity3 , you would n't be worried about who invented it			2
" in an article on the @entity95 's website , bluegrass historian @entity92 described @entity21 ' style as " a ' roll ' executed with the thumb and two fingers of his right hand " that essentially made the banjo " a lead instrument like a fiddle or a guitar , particularly on faster pieces and instrumentals			1
this novel sound attracted considerable attention to their @entity110 performances , road shows , and @entity113 recordings			0
" in 1945 , @entity21 met @entity6 when he joined @entity114 's @entity114 , for whom @entity6 was the guitarist and lead vocalist			1
along with the group 's mandolin - playing namesake were fiddler @entity118 and bassist @entity119 ( alias : @entity121 )			0
@entity21 and @entity6 left @entity114 in 1948 to form the @entity122 , according to the @entity95 website			1
along with guitarist / vocalists @entity125 and @entity128 , fiddler @entity129 and @entity114 alum @entity130 , the group played on @entity132 in @entity133 , @entity134 , and recorded for the @entity136 label			0
he married @entity138 certain that year			0
in the ' 50s she became @entity122 ' business manager			0
they were married for more than 57 years until her death in 2006			0
the @entity122 ' roster changed over the years , but @entity6 and @entity21 became the constants , the signature sound of the group on radio programs , notably those sponsored by @entity149 , and as regulars at the @entity110			1
they became syndicated tv stars in in the @entity153 in the late 1950s and early ' 60s , and they hit the country charts with the gospel tune " @entity156			0
" but it was during an appearance at a @entity160 folk club that brought them into contact with the producer of " @entity28 " and led to " @entity27 of @entity28			1
" it was their only single to climb to @entity166 on the country charts			0
the 1967 film " @entity169 " featured their 1949 instrumental " @entity172 , " with its distinctive @entity21 - style banjo solo perhaps the most ubiquitous of bluegrass sounds			1
the duo split in 1969 , and @entity21 ' fame as a solo and featured act continued to grow , even as his most iconic licks echoed through the years among his acolytes -- basically , anyone who played banjo , and many who picked other instruments			2
playing " @entity122 " on banjo became a staple of @entity188 's comedy routine , and blossomed into a reverential tribute			0
in november 2001 , @entity188 and @entity21 were joined by @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and others on " @entity194 " to play a fiery version of the song -- soloing alternately on banjo , guitar , mandolin , fiddle , steel guitar and harmonica			2
even @entity203 took the chorus for a spin on piano			0
in an article in the @entity208 in january , @entity188 wrote , " a grand part of @entity211 music owes a debt to @entity3			2
few players have changed the way we hear an instrument the way @entity57 has , putting him in a category with @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , and @entity222			0
" @entity122 were inducted into the @entity95 in 1985 , six years after @entity6 's death			2
in 1991 , @entity21 , @entity6 and @entity114 were the first inductees in the @entity225			1
his sons @entity1 and @entity227 both are accomplished musicians and songwriters , and played with their dad in a 1973 album , " the @entity233			0
" people we 've lost in 2012 : the lives they lived @entity0 's @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			2
