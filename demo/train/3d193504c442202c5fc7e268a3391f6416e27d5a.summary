-- @entity1 this week unveiled its @entity2 , which aims to do for the @entity3 what @entity5 's @entity4 did for mobile devices : it provides a place to explore and " install " web - based applications			1
the launch was announced alongside a new netbook running @entity12 , @entity1 's browser - centric operating system			2
and the web store is part of @entity2 , @entity1 's super-fast web browser			1
except that many @entity2 apps can run in other browsers , since they 're actually just websites			0
oh , and do n't mistake apps for " extensions , " which are add - ons for the @entity19			0
confused yet ? suffice to say , @entity1 's grand plans are ambitious , groundbreaking and darned difficult to explain to the average computer user			1
that 's why i think it 'll be some time before the world embraces @entity1 's vision for the future			2
@entity1 's grand plan what is @entity1 's vision ? ultimately , the company anticipates a future in which a web browser is all you 'll need			1
in an era when much of our time is spent online , operating systems such as @entity37 and @entity38 are overkill			0
instead , @entity1 plans computers that boot up almost instantly and take the user straight to the web browser			1
this will be made possible by @entity1 's super-simple operating system , @entity12 in this new world of web - based software , meanwhile , desktop applications are replaced with web applications -- all of your data and applications are stored on the @entity3 rather than the device			2
hence the launch of the @entity2			0
missing pieces @entity1 's @entity19 ambitions are hard to explain because these pieces of the puzzle are yet to be combined			0
while the @entity2 browser is growing in popularity , with nearly 10 % market share , the only @entity12 computer launched so far is a test model available to a select few developers and journalists			1
in short , @entity1 has essentially launched an app store for a series of devices that are yet to debut			1
yes , you could use the @entity2 as your starting point each day and jump into this new paradigm with both feet			0
but this is less intuitive when using a computer with existing desktop apps , browser bookmarks and other hallmarks of the existing paradigm			0
it 's a move that some early adopters may make , but a step too far for the mass market			0
slow progress in truth , i do n't see the @entity2 gaining steam until we have devices in stores running @entity12 -- expected sometime next year			2
only then will consumers truly grasp this new approach to computing : a super-simple operating system linked to a web - based app store			1
until that day , color us confused .			0
