holiday albums could be less forgettable when pictures of a @entity3 meal carry the scent of olives ; a selfie on the beach contains a trace of salt spray or a rainy @entity11 scene conveys the distinctive aroma of freshly wet concrete			2
if the digital age has increased the volume of communication , it may not have improved the quality			0
reversing that trend is the goal of a new generation of sensory engineers who are going beyond sight and sound to produce devices that use our untapped faculties			1
perhaps the most exciting breakthroughs right now are arriving in the form of smell - centered communication			1
" our motto is ' aroma tells a thousand pictures ' " , says dr. @entity31 , biomedical engineer at @entity32 and founder of @entity34 , known for producing radical sensory devices such as calorie - free chocolate spray			1
every human has thousands of distinct smell sensors , @entity31 explains , a resource he taps with his newest invention the @entity44			1

in collaboration with @entity55 perfumers @entity50 and baristas @entity52 , @entity31 has created a menu of scents , contained in ' @entity58 '			0
@entity61 electrical engineer @entity59 designed containers for them that release when heated by the touch of a button , but cool quickly to keep smells distinct and localized , a historic difficulty with the much - mocked smell - o - vision experiments in cinema			1
mix and match the @entity44 user can mix and match aromas and then send their composition as a message , which will be recreated on a fellow user 's device			1
up to 356 combinations will be possible in the first wave , rising to several thousand in the next year , and the dream is an exhaustive base -- the ' universal chip '			0
" biologically we respond powerfully to aroma , so if we become familiar with the design of aromatic communication we might be able to say things we could n't before " , says @entity31			0
he sees the limited aromas of the @entity44 as the first letters of a rich new language , that may be used as a basis for novels and symphonies			1
the faith is grounded on the acknowledged influence of smell on the subconscious , and the potential to learn its secrets			1
the first @entity101 will be limited to a select community of coffee enthusiasts			0
but the launch on july 10 will be accompanied by a more inclusive product : the first olfactory social network			1
a free app will allow anyone to compose and send a smell note by text or email , based on a set menu of aromas and variations			1
the message can be received by any normal phone as a text			0
the recipient can then download the composition from hotspots which will be set up in the launch city of @entity122			0
" we 're expecting an interest in self - expression and we 're ready to learn with the public " , says @entity31			0
" we would like to be reactive as new ideas for aromatic vocabularies arise , and to continue providing them for new interests			0
" read more : how to mend your body with silk he is betting the public around @entity122 's famous technology centers are early adopters , and will take the concept forward			1
beyond the city , the network will include a public interface for people to trade tips and recipes , and store them in cloud software			0
@entity31 plans to feature ' smell emoticons ' and viral stunts , and may offer a mixing deck that allows overlap with music production software			1
the concept can benefit from saturation of the current communication market , says trend analyst and editor of ' @entity156 ' @entity155			0
" we 're reaching a limit with what we can do with text data , and there is the potential to connect more deeply and personally through smell			1
" @entity155 also believes a consumer shift toward experience could drive adoption			0
" there is growing interest from brands in resources for creating richer experiences			0
smelly start - ups @entity173 such as @entity174 are publishing research , but for now start - ups are taking the initiative			0
@entity179 's @entity178 has been prolific in this space , engineering @entity183 device @entity181 that allows users to send a single fragrance between them			1
the company released an app worldwide in february , and has lucrative partnerships such as with @entity191 restaurant in @entity192 , that allows for online cooking tutorials with leading chefs to give students a whiff of the smell they are aiming for			1

" we can send a basic scent through a device like @entity181 , but we need the framework to make millions of them available through digitization			1
" @entity200 is testing a device that would connect us directly to the @entity219 , inspired by the successful connection of optical fibres to neurons of mice			1
his lab experiments involve subjects wearing a mouthguard - like device containing magnetic coils , from which electric signals are directed into the olfactory bowl to simulate the effect of smell			1
the wearer 's brains are scanned before and after to pinpoint the effect , and the results have encouraged @entity200 enough to believe a prototype could be available in two years			0
a similar technique has already born fruit with a similar design simulating the effects of taste			0
but taste has just four primary forms -- bitter , sweet , salty , sour -- whereas smell involves identifying individual molecules with no primary form			2
" the most basic smell still has hundreds of molecules and you need analytical chemistry to see what 's there " , says dr. @entity248 of the @entity249			2
" perhaps only 5 % would have an impact on smell , so it 's difficult to pick them out			2
it 's more trial and error than quantitative science			0
" healthy aroma @entity249 are also pursuing the goal of digitizing olfaction , with healthcare applications high on the agenda			2
one of their research areas is seeking smell biomarkers in cancer patients , using an ' e-nose ' to hunt chemicals in the blood to deliver early diagnosis			2
the process was inspired by the ability of dogs to sense sickness , although their smelling ability is multiples higher			0
although this research is still young in the lab , similar technology is already being smartphone - enabled			2
a @entity287 - developed chemical sensor has been released to a commercial partner as the basis for mobile applications that could breath - test users			2
@entity293 nanotechnology company @entity292 are raising several million dollars in venture capital for a handheld sensor that that could detect a wider range of diseases			0
medical uses are high on the agenda for the burgeoning @entity300 , whose upcoming conference will discuss olfaction technology for identifying dangerous gases , guidance for the blind and cognitive aid for @entity308 's sufferers			2
but industries as varied as military , travel , jewellery , food and entertainment will also be represented			0
dr. @entity200 believes the ultimate direction of goal is a multi-sensory device unifying all five senses to create an immersive virtual reality , and could be usable within five years			2
the neglected senses are making up for lost time			0
more from @entity322 , create , innovate : new technology can detect your mood possibly the world 's most impressive paper plane			2

sensory engineers developed @entity44 , a device that enables smell messaging .
a free app will soon allow anyone to compose and send a smell note .
the new technology could revolutionize our use of social media or healthcare
