-- she 's a drummer , a producer , a vocalist and a mom			2
@entity4 knows a lot about transformation			1
in fact , " transformation " is the title of the first track on @entity12 's @entity11 - nominated cd , " @entity13			1
" the vocals on the track " transformation " are performed by @entity17 , perhaps best known from her days as part of @entity19 , the singing group from the ' 70s that helped launch the career of the iconic singer @entity23			0
@entity12 explained the song was originally written and recorded by @entity17 in the 1980s			1
" i remember growing up listening to it and it was always a song i felt connected to on some level , " @entity12 said			1
in later years the two performed together and @entity12 said when she started to put " @entity13 " together , she thought , " why do n't we do a jazz version of ' transformation ' ? " the song varies quite a bit from the original and @entity12 said she was n't sure @entity17 would even like her arrangement			1
she said when she played it for @entity17 , " first she had to really get used to it and then she ended up really loving it and she sang it great as well			0
" " @entity13 " is @entity12 's fifth album			1
a child prodigy , she has toured with some of the greatest names in jazz over the past two decades , including luminaries such as @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
in fact , @entity12 , now 46 , was only 11 years old when she performed with drummer @entity51 on a television show , impressing him with her clean technique and solid coordination			1
she said " @entity13 " makes her feel , " a little bit like a trailblazer , " because when she was a kid starting out there were n't any other female drummers that she knew of and only a few female instrumentalists			1
" it 's good to see a lot of younger women not having any preconceived notions about what they can do , " @entity12 said			1
" it seems normal for a lot of them to play male - dominated instruments and i think that 's a beautiful thing			2
everything about this recording is about making a larger picture out of many various elements			0
" to that end , she gathered most of her closest friends ( who happen to be great musicians and great singers ) and had them help out with the project			0
@entity12 said she envisioned the project for awhile , then " ... it came together			2
the stars aligned and everybody was on board , so i was very fortunate			0
" included in that list of " friends " are some of the most prominent female jazz artists of the last few decades , including , besides @entity17 : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and more			0
the 14 - song set weaves a story of transformation , using everything from jazz to hip hop to the spoken word			0
civil rights and women 's rights activist @entity102 introduces a track called " @entity105 , " which @entity12 said brings together three women who have been very influential in her development as a black woman and " just figuring out who i am			1
" those three are : @entity112 of the group " @entity113 , " who originally wrote the song , @entity115 , who performs the vocals , and @entity118			0
@entity12 said she 's most proud of that song			1
listeners might be surprised to learn " @entity13 " also includes a cover of the @entity123 classic " @entity124			2
" @entity12 makes no secret of her affinity for the @entity123 ' music			1
on her last cd , " more to say , " she covered " @entity131			0
" @entity12 said she wrote the arrangement of " @entity124 " a few years back and played it live , but this seemed like the right time to record it			2
" i 'm already thinking about the next @entity123 song " she said with a chuckle			0
drumsticks in hand , @entity12 is helping trumpet the joys of jazz to new generations and new audiences and she 's optimistic about its future			1
" it 's a high art form , " she said			0
" i do n't think it 's going anywhere			0
" she said people often ask her if jazz is dead			0
" i still put on the classic jazz and it 's still very much alive , " she said			2
" what 's happening is it morphs and changes			0
but the library that 's being created under the umbrella of jazz is incredible and it 's just more and more music that people will have access to			2
