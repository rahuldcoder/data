" i have been told at my job to hide the fact i am @entity3 for my own personal safety by a manager			2
" " i worry for my wife who wears a headscarf and my children when they are with her and i am not there to protect them			2
" " i feel terrified for my two sons			2
although all three of us were born and raised here i fear for our safety			1
" " my dad recently asked my mother and sister to try and disguise their hijab with a hat			2
" " i do n't feel safe			0
i fear that if some could shoot me and my family and get away with it , they would			1
" those are just a small sample of the alarming responses i received on @entity29 when i asked my fellow @entity30 if they felt safe			1
our community 's fears have been elevated by the killing this month of three young @entity30 students in @entity36 , @entity37			1
and while there 's still a debate going on over whether this was , from a legal point of view , a hate crime , to the @entity32 it seems hard to imagine the attack was n't motivated at least in part by the faith of the three young victims			1
true , the suspect reportedly had disagreements with other residents in his apartment complex			0
but it seems telling that when he allegedly turned violent , it was only three @entity3 who were shot in the head			0
regardless , the concern felt by many in our community -- including myself -- actually predates these killings			0
in fact , six days before the shooting , i was one of 14 @entity30 to meet @entity64 at the @entity65 , and i raised the very fears that many of us feel			1
i explained to the president my worry that if @entity73 bigotry continues to go unchallenged , we could see someone target @entity30 in a violent attack			1
the president expressed his sincere concern , making it clear that there 's no place for bigotry in our nation			1
and during his speech wednesday at the @entity65 summit on countering violent extremism , he also acknowledged that " many @entity30 are worried and afraid			1
" to underscore the point , he then read a @entity89 card sent to him by an 11 - year - old @entity90 named @entity91 , who wrote : " i am worried about people hating @entity3			0
... if some @entity3 do bad things , that does n't mean all of them do			0
please tell everyone that we are good people and we 're just like everyone else			0
" her concerns are by no means misplaced , because the truth is that @entity73 bigotry has been building in recent years			1
we have seen acid thrown at an @entity104 school in @entity105 , and shots fired at a @entity108 mosque			0
and the list goes and on			0
in the last week alone , an @entity104 school in @entity111 was vandalized with @entity73 graffiti and the words : " now this is a hate crime			0
" and despicably , some on social media even cheered the burning down of an @entity104 center in @entity118			0
last thursday , meanwhile , a @entity30 man in @entity120 was allegedly beaten up at a local grocery store by two white men yelling racial and religious slurs			1
while these events do n't garner national headlines , they do make headlines within our community			0
and although statistically @entity3 are second to @entity132 in terms of being victims of hate crimes , there were still five times more hate crimes perpetrated against @entity3 in recent years than before 9/11 , the @entity130 notes			0
sobering as these statistics are , though , they mean little to @entity30 parents who are more worried about their own children 's safety			1
nor to the young @entity30 woman who fears she will be harassed for simply wearing a hijab			1
the perception for many in our community is that we are under siege , unsafe and alone			0
why this uptick in fear ? well , the primary cause is events we have zero involvement in , namely the actions of @entity153 and @entity154			1
but these fears have been exacerbated by the professional @entity73 bigots , certain pundits ( primarily on the right , but some on the left as well ) and some @entity163 elected officials ( @entity161 gov. @entity160 's baseless claims about @entity3 setting up " no go " zones being one of the most talked about examples )			2
so , what can be done to reduce this climate of @entity73 bigotry ? i wish i had a simple answer , but there is n't one			2
it 's akin to trying to counter anti-semitism , racism or homophobia -- it will require a concerted effort over time , as well as constant vigilance to ensure these forms of hate remain on the fringes of society			2
meanwhile , my hope is that the " good people , " as the rev. @entity185 put it , will no longer be silent in the face of hate			0
if you believe that no @entity191 should have to fear for his or her safety or be harassed simply because of his or her religious beliefs , then speak out			2
it could be through as simple an act as countering a hateful posting on social media or not sitting silently as someone spews ignorant comments			0
but whatever role you choose to play , you will be doing a real service to @entity191 by making one thing clear : there 's no place for this type of bigotry in our great nation .			1
