-- despite its xenophobic , anti-immigration campaign tactics , @entity2 's far - right @entity1 , which took the largest share of votes four years ago in @entity2 modern history , suffered losses in sunday 's parliamentary vote as voters chose more moderate parties over polarizing candidates			1
the conservative democrats and the @entity13 -- more moderate parties -- were the clear winners of sunday 's vote , signaling a change in the nation 's heavily polarized political scene			1
according to @entity23 , the nations ' public broadcaster and pollsters , near - final results showed the @entity1 taking a considerable drop , but still ahead of the center - left @entity25			1
the two traditional center - right parties , the @entity28 and the @entity29 are also down 3 % and 1.5 % respectively , @entity23 reported			1
the far - right @entity1 's loss came as a surprise to many who expected the far - right 's scare campaign tactics to succeed once again			1
a poster in the @entity37 - speaking part of the country shows black boots marching over the @entity2 flag			0
one in @entity42 - speaking areas shows a condom plastered over the @entity45 's banner , proclaiming " @entity2 protection against the @entity48 virus			2
" the anti-immigrant party looked to repeat its 2007 election victory , with pre-election opinion polls putting it in first place as voters cast ballots sunday for the federal parliament			2
a eurobarometer survey this month put the party , known as the @entity1 , far ahead of its main rivals , with just under a third of people saying they would back it			2
the @entity25 were in second place , with about 20 % support in pre-election polls , followed by the @entity66 , the @entity29 and the @entity13			0
the @entity1 won the biggest election victory in @entity2 history in 2007 , after a controversial campaign that blamed foreigners for much of the country 's crime			1
the nationalist party rode a wave of anti-immigration sentiment to gain 29 % of the vote -- about the same that it was getting in opinion polls ahead of the election			2
@entity2 's political system requires consensus , making radical government policies unlikely , regardless of the election results			0
but anti-immigrant sentiment helped fuel a 2009 ban on the construction of minarets , the towers usually built next to mosques for the traditional call to prayer			0
the @entity1 campaigned against minaret building in the national referendum , arguing that minarets are political symbols and therefore go against the the country 's constitution			1
the party 's campaign included fliers featuring a veiled woman against a background of a @entity2 flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles			0
the @entity104 against @entity105 denounced the posters , saying they " defame @entity2 's peaceful @entity108 population , feed prejudice and portray the @entity108 community as wanting to dominate @entity2 , oppress women and trample on fundamental rights			0
" four years ago , the @entity1 ran an ad campaign featuring a poster of a white sheep kicking a black sheep off the @entity2 flag			0
the party also called for immigrant families to be thrown out of the country if their children committed a crime			0
but while voters gave the @entity1 the biggest win in recent years in 2007 , they also elected the first black politician to the @entity127 @entity128 , who accused the @entity1 of " scapegoating , " came to @entity2 as an asylum seeker from @entity131			1
