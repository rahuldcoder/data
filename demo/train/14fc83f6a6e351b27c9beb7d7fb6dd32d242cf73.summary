-- as the @entity1 launched a barrage of airstrikes into @entity4 late monday , sen. @entity5 , @entity6 , who was an early backer of president @entity9 's first presidential campaign and his hand - picked chairman to run the @entity11 , says he is concerned about presidential military action into @entity4 without congressional authorization			1
" the point i think is so critical is the president should n't be doing this without @entity17 and ... @entity17 should n't be allowing it to happen without @entity17 , " @entity5 said tuesday at a form at the liberal leaning @entity19			2
@entity5 , however , said he is supportive of ongoing talks between the administration and congressional leadership on a possible new congressional war authorization			0

before @entity17 left , both chambers voted on a narrow measure that gave @entity9 the authority to train and arm @entity4 rebel groups			1
@entity17 did not act on a more broad measure that would have given the president the authority to expand its effort against @entity37 in @entity38 and @entity4			1
while @entity9 said he would welcome congressional authorization , republicans and @entity40 were split on whether he had authority from existing authorization focused on @entity44			1
some thought that the president needed additional congressional approval			2

he co-authored a letter to house speaker @entity87 urging a vote on war authorization			0
" this reminds me of the @entity94 administration , " he told @entity0 , referring to another expansion of military action			0
" i am not sure how much more we can ask of the military and the taxpayers without @entity17 having a debate			0
" while supportive of the strikes , rep. @entity99 , a member of the @entity11 @entity24 leadership , warned of mission creep , saying in a statement and in a tweet that the @entity24 should vote on a new war authorization that precludes any possibility of putting @entity56 combat troops on the ground			0
@entity56 - led airstrikes on @entity37 in @entity4 : who 's in , who 's out @entity9 's supporters @entity9 's supporters are usually his detractors			1

on monday , president @entity9 personally called house speaker @entity87 , @entity24 minority leader @entity118 and senate majority leader @entity119 to notify them that the military operation inside @entity4 would begin in the evening			1
@entity87 said he supports the airstrikes , " understanding that this is just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat this terrorist organization			0
" democrats and @entity79 who lead key committees approved of the president 's move , including @entity132 chairman @entity131 , who said " this is one step in what will be a long fight against @entity37 , " another acronym that refers to @entity37 , or the @entity137 in @entity38 and @entity4			1

" @entity146 said he told @entity141 he was " very supportive " of the administration 's move and would do what was needed of him to corral @entity17 if further congressional authorization is needed			1
campaign politics @entity37 has emerged as a campaign issue			0
@entity25 candidate @entity157 , @entity158 , released a television advertisement just after airstrikes in @entity4 commenced			2
while the ad did n't mention expanded military action into @entity4 , it tied his challenger , @entity11 sen. @entity164 , to the president , who has low approval ratings in @entity158			2
" anyone who turns on the tv these days knows we face challenges to our way of life			0
