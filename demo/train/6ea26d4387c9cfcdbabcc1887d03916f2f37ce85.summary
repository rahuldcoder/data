-- for a good part of her career , @entity2 's success has largely been due to relying on @entity6 songwriters and approaching arrangements in a pop - country fashion			1
while hits like " @entity10 , " " @entity11 " and " @entity12 " solidified her position as country radio royalty , @entity2 's shaking things up these days			1
she 's ditched both of those early crutches and now is exploring writing on her own and injecting a more roots - oriented sound into her instrumentation			1
such is the case with " eleven , " @entity2 's 11th studio album , which drops today			1
these days , she 's working with new management , has a new label in @entity24 and wrote six of the 11 songs that appear on her latest project as the 45 - year - old singer soldiers on , what about this moment inspired change , and how 's her own songwriting coming along ? @entity0 spoke with @entity2 recently as she was prepping for a concert in @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity0 : " @entity38 " comes with a lot of professional changes			1
why is this ? @entity2 : you know , sometimes it 's just time to shake things up a little bit			1
when you 've been at a certain place and management for 18 years , i just felt like i really need someone around me with some fresh ideas , some new passion and energy			1
@entity0 : as female country musicians age these days , are there pressures to stay youthful ? how does one age gracefully in @entity6 ? @entity2 : oh , i think the same way you age gracefully anywhere else			1
females have always had more of a focus on the way they look			1
no matter what business your in , if you 're in the public eye -- whether you 're an actor or a rock musician or even head of a corporation , it 's always been that way			1
you just try ... i do n't know , i try not to focus on it			1
i 'm still the same voice i had before , and i still have a lot to say			2
@entity0 : " @entity38 " was largely written by you -- something you 've taken on recently			2
what 's your writing process like ? @entity2 : it 's different every time			1
sometimes i 'll have an idea or a title			2
... i 'm still growing as a writer			2
one thing i think i bring to the table is having a certain type of lyric , in that i want the song to feel honest and real			2
i do n't do it 365 days a year , so i 'm fresh			2
i also do n't know a lot of the rules , which is probably a good thing			2
for me , it 's still about discovery			2
i 'm still in the stage of writing that i 'm discovering , getting confidence as a writer and that i do have some talent for it			1
it 's a good discovery at this stage of the game			2
@entity0 : and sometimes songwriters who start out at 20 , by 30 they feel like they 're all tapped out			2
@entity2 : i grew up admiring @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 ( @entity102 )			1
i did n't really grow up enamored only with singer - songwriters			1
when i moved to @entity6 , it was n't a big deal for me just to find songs by great writers and make them my own			0
but what i really found with this record was that it 's so nice to not have to wait for someone to write something			0
obviously , i love every record i 've made , but i feel like this record is more authentic to me			0
it 's different than just singing a song after it 's already been written			0
i 'm excited about that			0
@entity0 : on " @entity38 " the first single 's called " @entity119 , " which is about the trouble they can cause			0
did you give your parents any heart attacks growing up ? @entity2 : oh , oh , yeah			1
so far , my daughter is much better than me			0
i grew up on a farm in really rural @entity127 , where there was nothing to do			0
out of boredom , the activities we found to do , were n't exactly the best for my parents to go through			0
but i think the song 's about -- the teenage experience and wanting that independence and rebelling against the rule is so common , no matter where you are in the world			0
@entity0 : it seems harder these days to be a teenager			0
@entity2 : it 's different			1
they have a lot of peer pressure			0
we all did , but they have a cavalier attitude about things			0
they do n't have the same caution about certain things and are more like " whatever , it 's not that big a deal			0
" @entity0 : you were associated with the pop - country movement of the ' 90s , but listening to " @entity38 " and looking at your recent output , it does n't seem like you 're interested in that anymore			1
@entity2 : it 's interesting that you say that			1
i do n't know if i ever stood out to make a particular type of record			0
before , i was so dependent on the songs i found and the songs that came in			0
i was drawn to certain types of songs but i did n't have the luxury of waiting around for years and years			0
i had a vision of " @entity38 " being more organic , more retro , like a ' 70s rock record			0
it is less pop. @entity0 : on the @entity180 , you performed a tribute to @entity182 with @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
are there aspects of pop and rock these days you find intriguing ? @entity2 : i love @entity192 's new record			1
and i love @entity194 's record			0
my daughter 's really into the @entity196 and @entity197 , so i 've been listening to them recently			0
that 's a whole new type of thing ; i do n't know what you 'd call that .			0
