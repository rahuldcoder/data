-- it 's a surreal and horrifying scene			2
father and daughter are in a truck that 's parked in a relatively distant field , behind a fence			2
they 're watching a building burn			2
" it should collapse , " the dad says			2
then , suddenly : a deafening explosion			1
this @entity18 clip has been passed all over the @entity19 , including on news sites , since a fertilizer plant exploded in @entity22 , @entity23 , on wednesday			1
" are you ok ! ? " " dad ! @entity24 ! i ca n't hear ! get outta here ! please get outta here ! ... " " @entity26			2
" the video goes black			2
" i 'm pretty sure it lifted the truck off the ground , " @entity28 , who recorded the video , said in an interview on @entity32 's " today " show			2
" it just blew me over on top of her			2
it all happened so quick that things kind of went black for a moment			0
" @entity28 told the show his 12 - year - old daughter 's hearing had returned			0
authorities have n't determined the cause of that explosion , which is thought to have killed at least five people and injured scores more , according to news reports			1
it may well have been an accident , and i am in no ways insinuating it was linked to terror			1
but already people on the ground and in the media are comparing this tragedy -- along with the @entity60 , which may seem like an eternity ago , but happened monday ; and the letters that are thought to contain ricin and were intended for the president and a senator -- to others that linger in @entity69 's memory			1
it seems to be the week of terror flashbacks			0
that @entity18 clip -- it 's hard to watch and i ca n't decide if i should encourage you to do so or warn against it -- gives a small sense of what it must be like to live through any explosion , disaster or terrorist attack , regardless of its cause			1
even for those who have n't , many people in the @entity69 are being haunted this week by attacks and disasters of the past			1
and it 's tempting to feel like we 've been cursed to relive these nightmares over and over again			0
both of those anniversaries ( if we can call them that ) are this week , as @entity99 pointed out in a smart piece for @entity101			0
the fertilizer plant exploded in @entity22 , @entity23 , which is only 20 miles or so from @entity95 , the site of the @entity104 compound fire			1
" massive -- just like @entity105			0
just like the @entity109 in @entity93 , " @entity107 , from the @entity23 public safety department , said at a news conference			1
the letters that possibly contained ricin have thrown people back to the moment after the september 11 attacks when there was an anthrax scare on @entity117			1
the @entity119 bombings , cause unknown , drew comparisons to 9/11 , the @entity122 bombing -- and @entity93			1
a former co-worker of mine , @entity123 , wrote " an open letter from @entity126 regarding the @entity127 " on his blog			0
he highlighted the emotional parallels			0
" it 's hard to find the right words			0
but we feel your pain , shock and sadness			0
deep within us , " he wrote			0
" back in 1995 , while working for a little suburban newspaper in @entity93 , i went to the @entity140 site soon after the attack			1
what i saw reminded me of past bombings , overseas , in havens of war like @entity146			1
friends and co-workers are still haunted by what they saw there			0
@entity93 rebuilt , but did not forget			0
" the past comes back to life -- no matter the cause			1
and april is a particularly awful month for it			0
the assassination of the rev. @entity156 ( april 4 , 1968 ) ; the death of @entity158 ( april 15 , 1865 ) ; the shootings at @entity160 ( april 20 , 1999 ) ; and those at @entity161 ( april 16 , 2007 ) all happened this month in history			0
at the time of writing , no evidence links this week 's frightening events -- the bombing , the letter , the explosion			1
nor is there evidence to tie them to terror events of the past			1
i 'm not interested in teasing out the potential motives or causes behind these disasters			0
in the case of the @entity23 explosion , it 's possible that it was simply a horrific accident , although authorities say they are treating the area as a crime scene until they have firm evidence to the contrary			1
what is more interesting to me right now is the psychological toll this takes on us			1
this has been a traumatic week in every since of the word			0
lives lost in @entity119 and @entity22 , @entity23			1
as we pray for the victims and their families ... and sing the national anthem in unison at hockey games ... and run in tribute to those who were hit by a bomb at a marathon finish line ... and lend our support to people in @entity23 ... we 're left wondering what this all means and if we 'll be able to stitch up the wounds and move on			1
@entity211 : run for @entity119 2014 those directly hurt or whose loved ones were killed in these events may never be the same			1
but where does this leave the county as a whole ? it 's hard to say for now			0
perhaps , as many people have pointed out , we can take comfort in knowing there are " helpers " and heroes in each of these tragedies -- people run toward the sound of the blast or toward the flames			1
and in the fact that , as @entity233 wrote earlier this week , terrorist bombings in the @entity69 have been " exceedingly rare " since 9/11			0
we 'll have to wait for clues to emerge about what or who caused all of this week 's events to really know how to process them			2
there will always be flashbacks of terror and disaster and tragedy			2
maybe that 's the world we live in			0
but that does n't mean we ca n't push back			2
that 's why i 'll be watching from afar as people convene on april 28 for the @entity251			2
as @entity123 , my former colleague , writes , " we 'll be running for the 168 of our own who died and the many more who were spared but inexorably scarred			0
but we 're running for your guys , too			0
" the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity258 .			0

a fertilizer plant exploded in @entity23 on wednesday , killing at least five people
the cause of the explosion is unknown , according to reports
the @entity119 bombing , @entity23 explosion and ricin letters have not been linked
