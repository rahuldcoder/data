-- with just months to go before the presidential campaign ends all meaningful activity on @entity5 , members of @entity2 are struggling to move a few must - pass pieces of legislation			1
one of the most pressing is the highway bill , which @entity2 is considering this week			1
not only does all federal funding for transportation depend on passing a bill by march 31 ; the highway trust fund itself is scheduled to go broke in 2013 and the deal in the making pays for only two years			1
this is essential national maintenance			2
yet @entity2 is - you guessed it - gridlocked			1
we all know @entity19 is broken			2
what 's less clear : did it ever work better ? if it did , what was different ? what ingredients have been lost , and can we recapture them ? one place to look , especially apt in this instance : the 1956 congressional debate that created the interstate highway system			1
the 1956 @entity29 was the health - care legislation of its day , an epic @entity19 battle			1
the pressure had been building for decades as the number of cars exploded			2
traffic was a national nightmare			0
many intercity roads were hardly passable , and most @entity38 recognized that new highways were essential to continue the unprecedented growth the country had been enjoying since the end of @entity43 what no one could agree on was how to pay for the new system			1
the 1950s were a more consensual era , of course			0
both democrats and @entity50 had wanted to nominate gen. @entity51 for president in 1952 , and during the debate over the highway bill , his approval ratings rarely dipped below 70 %			1
but that does n't mean there were no disagreements			0
opinion : what 's wrong with @entity2 ? it 's not big enough ideological divisions were if anything sharper than they are today -- republicans were the party of big business , @entity49 the champions of the people and the @entity70			1
elections were just as competitive , partisan jockeying just as intense			0
and the debate about how to pay for the highway system -- tolls , taxes , bonds or some other way -- was n't just about money			1
it was about values - what kind of country we wanted to be			0
the debate built in intensity through the early ' 50s			1
there were blue - ribbon commissions , competing proposals , an array of shifting alliances and armies of lobbyists			0
the president 's proposal and a rival @entity49 plan were both shot down in early summer 1955			0
the main obstacles : truckers , motorists and the oil industry , all resisting new gasoline , tire and vehicle sales taxes			1
while the @entity106 worked behind the scenes in @entity19 , a national grassroots campaign whipped truck drivers into a frenzy , producing thousands of phone calls and telegrams to @entity2			1
but something strange happened over the next nine months -- a last , pivotal round of deal - making -- and a compromise package passed easily in april 1956			1
the biggest public works program since the pyramids , all told -- highways plus local connecting roads -- came in at $ 50 billion , more than two - thirds of the federal budget in 1956			1
but the years of negotiating paid off , and the deal held			2
in the end , only one @entity124 voted no , and the bill passed on a voice vote in the @entity128 ; approval was so overwhelming , there was no need to count			2
what changed in those nine months ? part of it was leadership , with sheer determination by lawmakers			0
the bill had dozens of moving parts and many fathers on both sides of the aisle			2
but the last , critical puzzle piece was the highway trust fund , which set aside the taxes paid by truckers and motorists for the highway system and nothing else			1
and the two men who worked together to advance the trust fund could hardly have made an odder couple : treasury secretary @entity153 , a @entity154 @entity50 and former corporate executive who came to @entity19 to cut government spending , and @entity38 rep. @entity157 of @entity158 , a glad - handing , big - spending , bring - home - the - bacon @entity162			2
both were more interested in problem - solving than ideological purity , in part because in 1956 , only problem - solving would win votes			2
both parties knew they needed to deliver a highway system			1
but @entity38 was different , too			0
the truckers and motorists who blocked the highway bill in 1955 changed their minds in 1956			1
flouting one of the nation 's most ingrained traditions , they accepted a voluntary tax			1
they recognized that though they would pay , they would also benefit , and in the end the roads would be more than worth the cost			0
this was partly because of the trust fund			0
but that was n't all			0
truckers , motorists , auto manufacturers , oil companies and others understood that better highways would mean more commerce			2
more commerce meant industry would produce more goods			0
more production would put more people to work			0
and their increased consumption would lead to yet more growth			0
this was the win - win - win perpetual - motion machine that had been driving the economy since 1945			0
and based on the prosperity of the previous decade , most voters believed a rising tide would still lift all boats			0
can we apply these lessons today ? i 'm not sure			2
so much is so different , and we ca n't turn back the clock			0
still , it 's something to ponder as @entity49 and @entity50 shout past each other on @entity5 in coming weeks			0
it does n't have to be this way			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

@entity220 : @entity2 weighing highway bill that provides transportation funds
she says 1956 debate that created interestate system should give @entity2 a clue
she says battle was fierce , like health care bill today ; @entity2 made deal for public good
@entity220 : truckers , drivers accepted a tax ; @entity2 should learn from this
