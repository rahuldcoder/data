@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is booming			1
the @entity5 suburb is lined with strip malls , subdivisions , and small factories , in what was once sleepy farmland			2
the population has grown fivefold since 1970 to about 200,000			2
change is afoot in this bedroom community , at least on the surface			2
but the federal government thinks an underlying threat of discrimination remains throughout @entity1 and other parts of the country in perhaps the most hard - fought franchise in the @entity21 : the right to vote			1
competing voices in this county , echoes of decades - long debates over equal access to the polls , now spill out in a 21st century fight , one that has reached the @entity30 @entity29			1
veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost " i think they are looking at this situation through rose - colored glasses , " says the rev. dr. @entity34 , a local civil rights leader , about the current majority white power structure in @entity3			1
" i think they have painted a picture to make the outside world believe that racism is no more			2
but if you dig beneath the surface i think you 'll find what you are looking for			0
" a longtime county leader , however , says things truly have changed for the better			0
" here , now , in this decade , we have black registered voters at a percentage that is equal , and at some occasions exceeding , the voting of the white population , " says county attorney @entity60 " it 's hard to find that there 's any discrimination here , and certainly there 's nothing in the congressional record			1
" major case for court this term now the nine - member high court is poised to rule in coming days on whether the key enforcement provision of the landmark @entity67 should be scrapped , as a constitutionally unnecessary vestige of the civil rights era			1
known as @entity72 , it gives the federal government open - ended oversight of states and localities like @entity3 with a history of voter discrimination			1
any changes in voting laws and procedures in the covered states must be " precleared " with @entity83			1
that could include something as simple as moving a polling place temporarily across the street			0
the provision was reauthorized by @entity89 in 2006 for another 25 years			0
@entity3 officials subsequently filed suit , saying the monitoring is overly burdensome and unwarranted			1
this case is one of the biggest the justices tackle this term , offering a social , political , and legal barometer on the progress of civil rights in the @entity30 and the level of national vigilance still needed to ensure minorities have an unburdened path to the election process			1
high court poised for high - stakes rulings test of federal authority civil rights groups say @entity72 has proven an important tool to protect minority voters from local governments that would set unfair , shifting barriers to the polls			1
if it is ruled unconstitutional , they warn , the very power and effect of the entire @entity67 would crumble			0
but the provision 's opponents counter it should not be enforced in areas where it can be argued racial discrimination no longer exists			1
the appeal presents the court and its shaky conservative majority with two of the most hotly debated issues in politics as well as constitutional law -- race and federalism			0
it will be a major test of @entity83 's authority , and the extent to which the central government may consider vestiges of voting discrimination that may still linger , potentially keeping some minority voters disenfranchised			1
the @entity67 was a monumental political achievement during the @entity140			1
it banned such things as poll taxes and literacy tests that had long suppressed black voter turnout			0
states like @entity146 and @entity147 also have a history of discrimination against @entity151 voters			0
in upholding the coverage requirements , the high court in 1966 succinctly summarized the law 's purpose : " @entity89 felt itself confronted by an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the @entity21 , " said the justices			0
" @entity89 concluded that the unsuccessful remedies which it had prescribed in the past would have to be replaced by sterner and more elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of the @entity167			0
" the act was to expire in 2007 but was extended by @entity89 to 2032			0
it places all or parts of 15 states with a record of past discrimination -- mostly in the @entity174 -- under strict requirements on election procedures			1
the @entity177 has defended continuing use of the preclearance provision in court , but the @entity181 has led the charge to raise public awareness of the case			1
" closing off the paths to the polls and by trying to deter people from voting is too often practiced and trained and focused on minority communities , " said @entity185 , special counsel with the group 's @entity186 , who argued before the justices in february			1
" it does n't happen everywhere but it happens too much			0
" @entity3 is 11 % african - american , compared with 28 % statewide			1
@entity197 and his family have deep roots there			0
he is a former state senator and the county attorney for a half - century			0
his son , @entity202 , serves on the nine - member , all - white county commission			0
from his comfortable law offices , @entity60 was persuaded to bring this legal fight because of what he says is a fundamental question of inequality in the section 5 regulatory scheme			1
" over the years we realized that this burden was unfair and unjustified , " he said			0
" we just elected a black member of the board of education , with a 90 % white population			0
we 've elected a black mayor over a white incumbent , we 've elected black city council members			0
" many neighborhoods , he says , are integrated			0
fast facts : top @entity30 @entity29 decisions the dispute in @entity224 @entity60 acknowledges a voting dispute in the city of @entity224 was not handled well by local officials , but chafes at the assumption things are irreparably bad in @entity3			1
he says it is especially hard to disprove a negative			0
he is convinced that no pervasive racial bias currently exists in the county power structure			0
" @entity234 has changed , it is not the same it was in 1964 , " @entity60 said			0
" the whole country has changed			0
we are a dynamic society , not just in @entity1 but everywhere			1
" some have called the preclearance requirement a @entity240 or badge of shame @entity174 , mostly , must perpetually endure			1
@entity246 , in the minds of many african - americans and @entity151 in the county , is subtle and deep - rooted -- a " good ol ' boy " system , as the rev. @entity34 puts it			0
he and other civil rights activists point to the 2008 election in @entity224 , where only one @entity250 was serving , @entity251			1
the city , over the objections of the @entity177 under its @entity72 authority , changed the voting boundaries , costing @entity256 his seat			1
he believes it was an effort to weaken minority voting strength			2
" some sub-developments were added to my district and diluted the @entity250 - @entity30 district from a 67 % district down to about 28 % , " @entity251 told @entity2			0
" i think of the possibility of what could happen if @entity72 could go away -- that some of the old mindsets would kind of fall back into place			0
" after the feds intervened , a new election was held and @entity251 got his seat back			0
the government points out that some areas have gotten out of @entity72			2
in recent years , 31 cities and counties in @entity276 successfully petitioned to be exempt from the preclearance requirements , though the rest of the state remains under federal oversight			1
@entity281 was removed from federal oversight in march			2
@entity3 has not made such a request ; it opposes @entity72 on its face			1
opinion : bring voting into the digital age ' serious constitutional questions ' the @entity177 also said the @entity29 had , in recent years , narrowed the scope of some aspects of the @entity67			1
justice @entity291 , who could prove a swing vote in the @entity1 dispute , noted in an earlier unrelated case involving @entity72 that " racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not ancient history			1
" but it may be chief justice @entity299 who is exercising the power to lead the tricky but crucial opinion - writing exercise			0
that is because he authored that 2009 high court ruling , suggesting @entity72 's days were numbered			0
he said the preclearance provision raises " serious constitutional questions , " and added it " represents an intrusion into areas of state and local responsibility that is unfamiliar to our federal system			1
" " things have changed in the @entity174			0
voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity , " @entity299 said at the time , echoing the views @entity3 now makes in its appeal			1
" past success alone ... is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements			2
" the court for four years avoided the key question of the law 's constitutionality			2
civil rights supporters worry the court 's five conservative members will strike down this and another pending appeal over affirmative action in public college admissions			1
any dispute about voting slips inevitably into politics and efforts by both @entity338 and @entity339 to preserve their power bases			2
section 5 lawsuits have been acute in the past two years			0
they involve challenges to constitutionally mandated boundary changes in state and congressional districts based on the 2010 census ; new , stricter voter identification requirements ; and reductions in early voting periods			2
those fights are now clogging the federal courts			2
some conservative groups have argued that " ancient formulas " are being applied today , not to erase discrimination , but to benefit a particular political party			2
some liberal activists counter @entity72 and federal oversight are being demonized by many on the right for purely partisan gain , and to divide @entity30 again over race			2
in @entity3 , both sides know the nation is watching and know the stakes will ripple widely			1
" i 'm not saying everything 's perfect , " @entity60 tells @entity2			0
" but i 'm saying , very few of the non-covered jurisdictions can give you a success story like i 've just given you out here in @entity3			1
" " i agree that things have changed in the @entity174 and they are better , " says @entity34 , senior pastor at @entity371 in @entity224 , " but they have n't reached the point where we could do away with @entity72 yet			0
" it 's a lot better , but it still lives , discrimination still lives , and i 'm not willing to trust ( voting enforcement ) into the hands of people whose motives are not pure			2
" the case is @entity384 ( 12 - 96 )			2
@entity2 's @entity385 and @entity386 contributed to this report .			0

the leaders of @entity3 , @entity1 , say preclearance is no longer needed
preclearance by the federal government is required for changes in voting procedures
the @entity29 is poised to rule on the question
the case offers a social , political , and legal barometer on the progress of civil rights
