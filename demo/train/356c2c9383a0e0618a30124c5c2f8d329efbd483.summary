@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 gestures a greeting to her visitors at @entity0 's burn hospital			1
her head wrapped in fresh bandages , her frail body under a red fleece blanket , @entity3 is slowly regaining her dignity			1
tears stream down her cheeks , not of pain anymore , but relief			0
she is grateful for all those who have helped her in her ordeal			0
she prays now for @entity21 to heal her and return her to her family in @entity23			0
@entity3 worked as a nanny for two of former @entity1 leader @entity27 's grandchildren			1
when she could n't keep one from crying , @entity29 , the wife of @entity27 's son @entity30 , poured boiling water on her head			1
@entity2 journalists discovered her in @entity35 's plush home after @entity37 forces overran @entity0 and @entity35 and his wife fled to @entity39			0
@entity3 's scalp and face were a mosaic of injuries that rendered her face into a grotesque patchwork			1
even though the burns were inflicted three months ago , she was still in considerable pain			0
" i think it 's a crime against humanity , " said @entity49 , the new @entity1 health minister			0
apparently , it was not just @entity3 who suffered as servants of @entity35 's family			2
a man too frightened to reveal his name led @entity2 reporters to another one of @entity35 's properties , a gated , high - walled villa - like house , where the man said more abuse was meted out to staffers			1
" @entity3 is not the only one , " he said , describing a @entity65 man who was also scalded with water after he burned an undershirt he was ironing			1
he said the foreign staff bore the brunt of the abuse			0
another foreign nanny contacted @entity2 and described @entity72 as a " sadist " and a " psychologically sick " woman			1
a room in the villa perhaps bears out the nanny 's words -- a prison cell in a private home			2
back at the burn hospital , @entity3 faces months of recuperation and surgery			2
her story generated enormous public response			0
so far , people have donated more than $ 16,000 dollars for her care			0
now , @entity2 is working with several agencies to make sure that @entity3 gets proper care and that she can get back home to her family after her nightmare under the @entity95 .			2
