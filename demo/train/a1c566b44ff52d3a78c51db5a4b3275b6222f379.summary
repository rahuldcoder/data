-- @entity1 and @entity2 knew each other for several months before they met in person			0
but , when they finally did connect , it was as if they had known each other for much longer			2
" the emotion was so genuine , " @entity9 said of their first encounter			0
" when she looked at me , she looked like she saw a friend of hers that she had not seen in a long time			0
" the two met at a gathering for @entity20 - area " pinners , " the name fans use to pledge their allegiance to @entity23 , the popular @entity24 pinboard			1
as the online community swells with more and more people sharing images of dream homes , extravagant food and inspirational phrases , pinners are forging connections in real - life at fan parties such as may 's " @entity35 " in @entity20			1
the gatherings also offer an opportunity to capture a slice of @entity23 's audience in one room at a time : women of all colors , sizes and income brackets and a few well - dressed men			1
many have dozens of boards and hundreds , if not thousands of pins , that they use for a variety of purposes , from sharing and storing recipe and decor inspiration to networking and creating their own brand			0
from pins to projects : pinterest in real life @entity23 has organized several meet - ups in the past year in @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , which drew guests from @entity66 and even as far as @entity67			1
the @entity20 event was unique because pinners from the area hatched and planned the event on their own			1
besides donating t - shirts and promoting the event on social media , @entity23 had no hand in directly organizing it			1
" this party and other parties of this nature are truly an amazing effort by the @entity83 themselves , " a @entity23 spokeswoman said in an e-mail			1
the self - driven model is gaining ground			2
pinners are known to host get - togethers in homes or organize outings based around activities and recipes discovered via @entity23			1
and , because they already have one passion ( or several ) in common , striking up small talk at these events can be a little easier than meeting up with perfect strangers			0
the parties are opportunities to meet others whose taste these pinners admire from afar			1
@entity103 , who admits to being " pin - obsessed , " started planning the @entity20 event in february with the goal of bringing pinners together to benefit a local nonprofit			1
it turned out to be an easy sell for @entity23 , which contributed giveaways for a raffle , and for local sponsors , who donated free food and drinks			1
she found the perfect venue in craft store @entity118 , a converted house that sells recycled goods by local artists , from wind chimes and jewelry made of glass bottles to driftwood wall signs bearing inspirational phrases			2
" @entity118 represents a live version of @entity23 , " @entity103 , who wore a gray @entity23 t - shirt as she greeted visitors outside the store			1
" it is creative and community - based , and i love that			2
[ it ] reminded me why i love @entity23 so much ! " it was a no - brainer for the store 's owner , @entity137 , an avid pinner who promotes items from the store on her boards			1
interest , meet @entity23 : site helps users catalog their passions " the idea was to form a community around @entity23 in @entity20 that extends beyond just sitting behind a computer [ and ] into the community to see actual things that are featured on @entity23 , " @entity137 said			1
guests walked up stairs to an enclosed porch , where a table of red velvet and rum raisin cake balls awaited them , courtesy of " @entity158 " baker @entity157			0
past the colorful wooden birdhouses and lawn decorations of corrugated metal , another table offered vases of @entity164 and popcorn in a nod to the " vase - as - a - vessel - for - other - items " motif popular on @entity23			1
several guests remarked that they had seen the sausage cheddar balls on @entity23 as well			2
initially , guests moved around tentatively in groups of two and three , taking pictures with smart phones and @entity175 of store goods and pinning them			0
as time passed and drinks were imbibed , people began mingling			0
@entity2 was milling among the crowd when she recognized @entity1 from photos on her boards			0
@entity2 , who owns a catering business with her husband , wanted to put a real face to the person whose images of food and " tablescapes " she frequently " liked " or commented on			2
@entity9 started following @entity191 's " @entity192 " board after seeing a blog image of a kitchen with black cabinetry accented with a gray , heavily distressed island and wood floors			0
" when i look at her pins , i think , ' that kitchen could be my kitchen , ' " said @entity9 , a public relations professional who runs her own boutique agency			0
" pinning is about creating a place to escape to , a perfect world around whatever the topic is			0
she gives me photos that i can bring to my collection			0
" the two shared a laugh over the odd familiarity of the relationship and talked about each other 's pins before parting ways , feeling as if they had just reconnected with an old friend			0
" it reminded me of the importance to still connect face - to - face with people , but the cool part was that social media , pinning to be exact , was the commonality we shared , " @entity9			2
" instead of the usual ' hello , i 'm so - and - so , what do you do ? ' it was more like , ' oh ! you 're so - and - so ! ! ! i love the picture you posted the other day , " she said			2
" it was a very cool experience and shows just how social media has influenced the way we connect			0
