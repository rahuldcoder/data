the escalation in recent days of eastern @entity2 's brutal war demonstrates that unless its root causes are addressed in a broader peace process , violence could intensify and @entity6 could be drawn more directly into the fray , regionalizing the war			1
over the past week , @entity2 's army has nearly militarily defeated the most powerful rebel group , the @entity10			0
@entity6 has threatened to strike @entity2 in retaliation for what it claims was shelling on its territory by @entity2 's army			1
@entity10 may soon be a spent force militarily , but many other armed groups are still active and could replace it as major destabilizers of eastern @entity2 unless the root causes of the war are addressed			1
recently suspended talks in @entity21 only involve the @entity2 government and @entity10 , and address none of the underlying political , economic , or security drivers of violence that have created the deadliest conflict globally since @entity28 corrupt governance , intercommunal divisions and illegal exploitation of lucrative natural resources allow the @entity2 army and a host of predatory militias to operate with impunity			0
but the most important factor in ending mass violence is the @entity2 - @entity6 relationship and the economic and security interests that underlie it			1
the fates of @entity6 and @entity2 are deeply intertwined			1
the aftermath of the @entity6 genocide spilled over into @entity2 in the mid- 1990s , acting like gasoline on the fire of preexisting ethnic tensions , localized conflict and state collapse			1
since then , @entity6 's periodic direct intervention and support for armed groups in eastern @entity2 have been central drivers of continuing conflict			1
remarkably , however , no major international peace initiative has comprehensively analyzed and addressed @entity6 's core interests as part of a solution			1
@entity6 security interests in @entity2 center on containing the threat posed by the @entity2 - based armed group , the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , whose leaders participated in the 1994 genocide against @entity6 tutsis			2
@entity2 's army has at times supported the @entity62			0
the @entity6 government , which defeated the regime that committed the genocide , believes that as long as the @entity62 is in @entity2 with supporters around the world motivated by a genocidal ideology , it represents a threat			2
@entity6 also has economic interests in @entity2 in natural resources , land and cross-border trade			2
@entity6 has its own domestic minerals sector but benefited significantly from smuggled conflict minerals from @entity2 -- in particular tin , tantalum , and tungsten -- for several years			2
according to numerous @entity87 investigative reports , some @entity6 traders have relabeled @entity2 minerals as @entity6 and exported them			2
@entity6 is reliant on the minerals trade to reduce its significant balance of trade deficit			0
widely divergent opinions focus on @entity6 president @entity93			0
supporters cite his ending the 1994 genocide and tout the country 's dramatic economic recovery since then , but are uncritical of @entity6 's role in @entity2 or the lack of internal political freedom			1
critics focus only on its destructive behavior in @entity2 and repressive policies at home but overlook the progress @entity6 has made in other spheres			1
the " 11 +4 framework " for a peace initiative signed by all the governments in the region provides a new window to address the core causes of the conflict and involve civil society			0
the appointments of @entity117 and @entity118 as @entity87 and @entity120 envoys , respectively , further improve the odds			0
the primary key to ending the violence is changing the economic incentives from war to peace and addressing regional security threats			2
this in no way diminishes the urgent need for political reforms in @entity132 , @entity133 , and elsewhere in the region , as well as the importance of placing targeted sanctions against any officials supporting armed groups , combating spoiler militias like the @entity62 and @entity10 by buttressing the @entity141 's capacities and prosecuting war crimes			0
but the most promising opportunity for peace is in the economic interdependence between @entity2 and @entity6			1
the perceived zero - sum nature of @entity6 's interests that help fuel the war has to be transformed for the war to end			1
if the mineral sector alone was developed by serious investment in conflict - free , transparent semi-industrial and industrial mining , and the artisanal trade was more formalized with better equipment and fair - trade small - scale mining , there would be a greatly expanded economic pie for the entire region			0
instead of the current fighting over surface - level minerals left to armed smugglers , there could be exponentially larger revenues for both countries and wealth - building opportunities for @entity2 communities from the deeper mines in a legal , peaceful trade			0
the envoys can help by pressing to finalize the regional minerals certification process and asking the @entity170 to accelerate its regional infrastructure programs			0
@entity6 and @entity2 can grow together if @entity6 becomes a gateway for international businesses to invest in @entity2 's natural resource sector , while attracting investors on the basis of good roads , electricity , transparent business regulations and banking institutions			1
@entity181 grew similarly by attracting investors interested in neighboring @entity183 's and @entity185 's natural resources			0
all three countries benefited tremendously from this arrangement : @entity185 , @entity183 , and @entity181 are now all in the top 20 % of world economies			0
@entity2 and @entity6 may not be top 20 candidates soon , but a peaceful sub-region would be a good start .			0
