-- @entity1 has said it hopes to have a relief well in place in august to permanently cut off the oil gushing into the @entity5			1
the company has said the operation is the best sure - fire way of plugging the massive oil leak			2
a relief well is a well drilled into the existing well , intercepting the flow and allowing a specialized heavy liquid to be pumped into the flowing well to bring it under control			0
@entity1 began drilling the first relief well on may 2 and started drilling a second one two weeks later			1
the wells are being dug to a depth of about 18,000 feet , just above the oil reservoir			2
once one hits the original pipe , just 7 inches in diameter , drilling mud will be shot into it to stop the spewing oil			1
cement will then be used to permanently seal it			0
the second relief well is part of a contingency plan in case the first well encounters any delays			0
relief wells have been used to plug two other large blowout spills			1
in 1979 , it took nearly 10 months to seal the world 's largest spill in @entity38 's @entity37			0
more recently , an @entity40 accident last year known as the @entity42 spill , was plugged after nearly four months			0
in both cases , efforts such as those used to try to stop the @entity46 spill -- containment domes and junk shots -- were fruitless			0
and it took multiple tries before the relief wells reached the original wells .			1

relief wells may be used to stop oil gushing into @entity5
@entity1 hopes to have a well in place by august
drilling for the first well began on may 2
