@entity0 , @entity1 -- after eight months of bickering and political paralysis , @entity4 leaders were thought to have finally reached a power - sharing agreement thursday for a new government , but that deal appeared to fall apart late in the day as members of the @entity12 - backed @entity11 walked out of the parliamentary session			1
@entity14 , sworn in late thursday for a second term as president , delegated @entity18 prime minister @entity17 to form a government within 30 days , as mandated by the constitution			1
thursday 's session then adjourned until saturday			1
quarreling that has typified @entity1 's gridlock re-emerged during the parliamentary session , from which most members of the @entity12 - backed @entity11 bloc walked out saying that the other political blocs were not adhering to their promise to vote on the tentative power - sharing agreement , which had been reached late wednesday			1
the @entity11 had wanted parliament to vote on that agreement before voting for a president in order to ensure guarantees that had been promised to the @entity12 were in fact delivered			1
in the past , politicians have made promises to @entity12 that have not materialized , resulting in a widespread lack of trust			1
politicians had cobbled out a compromise wednesday that would have left @entity17 in power and created a powerful new office that was expected to be headed by his rival , former prime minister @entity45 , lawmakers said thursday			1
under the proposed deal , the three major governmental positions were to have been filled by three members of the country 's largest ethnic groups -- the @entity49 , the @entity49 and the @entity12			1
@entity14 , who was to remain as president , is @entity54			0
lawmakers on thursday elected @entity56 , a @entity12 from the @entity57 , to be the parliament speaker			1
they also chose @entity59 , a lawmaker from the hard - line @entity60 , to be first deputy speaker and @entity63 , who is @entity54 , as the second deputy			2
but @entity12 did not consider @entity56 to be adequate representation , and many members of the @entity11 bloc walked out when parliament did n't accept its demand for a vote on the actual power - sharing agreement			1
@entity18 lawmakers said the vote could n't be taken because it was not on the agenda , but @entity45 disputed this			0
even @entity56 walked out , saying he had reservations over continuing the session marked by distrust			2
but , shortly afterward , he returned without explanation			0
still , politicians were hopeful that a deal could emerge			0
prior to the walkout , @entity81 , a @entity54 lawmaker , said , " we reached a power - sharing deal but it is like assembling a car with different parts and hoping it will work			1
" @entity1 's government had been in a stalemate since the march 7 parliamentary elections , in which @entity17 won 89 seats but lost to @entity45 's bloc , which won 91 seats			2
the political vacuum that followed has stoked fears that political instability would fester			0
in @entity98 , a senior administration official who did not want to be identified called the agreement " a big step for @entity1			2
" " we 've worked very hard in recent months with the @entity1 to achieve one basic result , and that 's a government that 's inclusive , that reflects the results of the elections , that includes all the major blocs representing @entity1 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone , " the official said			2
" and that 's exactly what the @entity1 seem to have agreed to do			0
" another senior administration official who asked not to be identified told reporters , " this really is an @entity4 victory because this was an @entity4 decision that was made by @entity1 in @entity1			0
" the first senior administration official said @entity119 president @entity118 and vice president @entity120 had spoken " to virtually all of the major @entity4 leaders " in recent days			0
in the calls , @entity118 " reiterated our strong desire to see an inclusive government in @entity1 , and welcomed the steps that have been taken toward reaching that goal , " said @entity122 , deputy @entity123 adviser for strategic communications			0
" he also stressed the need for dr. @entity45 , other members of @entity11 , and representatives from all of the winning blocs to hold leadership positions in the new national partnership government			0
" the move comes as the @entity119 has been drawing down its seven - year military presence to a noncombat force			2
overall levels of violence have decreased since 2006 and 2007 , but the country has endured eruptions of attacks lately that resemble the @entity18 sectarian violence during the height of the war			0
the incumbent @entity17 , whose @entity149 is @entity18 , has backing in @entity150 and from many @entity4 shiites , including the influential @entity18 cleric @entity152			0
the choice of a @entity154 as a deputy parliament speaker reflects the movement 's clout , and @entity17 's alliance with @entity60 has stoked concern among @entity119 officials because of @entity161 in the group			0
@entity45 , who served as prime minister in the early years of the new @entity4 government , is from a @entity18 background but is a secular figure who is well regarded by many @entity119 officials			0
his bloc , regarded as secular and cross-sectarian , has won a great deal of support from @entity12 and he has consistently opposed @entity17 for another term as prime minister			1
the two leaders had been jockeying for enough votes for a coalition government , but neither had been able to garner the 163 - seat majority needed in the @entity180 to form a government			2
earlier this week , @entity1 's top political leaders met in the @entity54 north to break the more than eight - month deadlock , a development sponsored by @entity186			2
there had been fears that @entity45 's bloc would boycott any government led by @entity17 , but the creation of an entity called @entity193 for the @entity194 appeared to have helped ease the way for compromise			1
the body was created in an effort to reduce the power of the prime minister , @entity81 said , and the committee was to be headed by @entity45			0
@entity11 was demanding that legislators pass a law within 30 days forming the national council and forming a committee to review the files of people illegally detained , a great concern for @entity12 who have accused @entity1 's @entity18 - dominated government of persecuting them			1
it was calling for a final agreement on outstanding legislation and for canceling a ban on three top @entity12 @entity214 politicians from running in elections			1
those three have been accused of ties to @entity219 's outlawed @entity218 movement			0
if a power - sharing agreement is not reached in which @entity1 's @entity12 feel fairly represented , sectarian violence could re-erupt in @entity1 , a country where politics and violence tend to go hand in hand			1
many @entity1 told @entity2 that they blame a recent rise in violence on the political vacuum of the last eight months .			0

eight months of bickering and paralysis had appeared to end in a power - sharing agreement
but that agreement appeared to fall apart late thursday when the @entity12 - backed bloc walked out
" it is like assembling a car with different parts and hoping it will work , " a legislator says
