-- there are about 500 million @entity2 worldwide , but it 's unclear exactly when in history this religion began			2
the @entity7 's life story spread first through oral tradition , and little physical evidence about @entity2 's early years has been found			1
now , scientists for the first time have uncovered archaeological evidence of when the @entity7 's monumentally influential life occurred			2
excavations in @entity15 date a @entity17 shrine , located at what is said to be the @entity7 's birthplace , to the sixth century @entity20 the research , published in the journal @entity23 , describes the remains of a timber structure about the same size and shape as a temple built at the same site in the third century @entity20 archaeologists also found reason to think that a tree grew at the center of this ancient structure , lending support to the traditional story that the @entity7 's mother held onto a tree branch while giving birth to him			1
" this is one of those rare occasions when belief , tradition , archaeology and science actually come together , " lead study author @entity40 , professor at @entity41 in the @entity42 , said at a press briefing monday			2
if this study is correct , the @entity7 's actual life could have overlapped with a popularly recognized time frame of 563 - 483 b.c. but lots of other date ranges for the @entity7 have been tossed around -- some scholars say 448 to 368 @entity20 , for instance			1
( the @entity58 website about his birthplace says 623 b.c. ) " we know the entirety of the shrine sequence started in the sixth century @entity20 , and this sheds light on a very long debate , " @entity40 said			1
a place for pilgrims the @entity68 site in @entity15 is one of four principal locations that are believed to be connected with the @entity7 's life			2
@entity73 is where he is became enlightened , @entity72 is where he first preached and @entity76 is where he died			0
@entity68 is located in " a subtropical chain of forests , marshes and grasslands " between @entity15 's border with @entity83 and the @entity84 of the @entity85 , according to the study			0
historical documents from @entity89 travelers show that pilgrims made the journey to @entity68 for many centuries			1
the site was lost and stopped attracting pilgrims after the 15th century -- no one knows why -- but @entity68 was rediscovered in 1896			1
it was declared the birthplace of @entity7 because of a sandstone pillar there , dating from the third century @entity20 the pillar 's inscription states that @entity100 visited this site of @entity7 's birth			1
scholars say the more modern @entity104 at @entity68 , named after the mother of @entity7 , was constructed on top of the foundations of more than one earlier temple or stupa , which is a dome - shaped @entity17 monument			1
one of those older temples dates back to the third century @entity20 , from the time of @entity100			1
but there 's also evidence of the even earlier temple , which appears to have covered about the same size and shape as the @entity100 temple , @entity40 said			0
the earliest site beneath remains of the @entity100 temple , archaeologists found a series of postholes from where timber posts had rotted out			1
" indeed , our excavations have demonstrated that the earliest construction at @entity68 appears to have comprised a timber fence or railing marking a cardinal direction , " the study authors wrote			2
the central , open portion of the most ancient temple appears to have housed a tree , based on the discovery of large fragments of mineralized tree roots			0
this part of the temple also had never been covered by a roof			0
to establish the dates of the earliest @entity17 shrine at @entity68 , @entity40 and colleagues analyzed charcoal found within postholes , as well as sand			1
different techniques used on each of these materials pointed to the same conclusion of the sixth century @entity20 , but the postholes indicated a range of about 800 to 545 b.c. " if the postholes at @entity68 are indicative of a tree shrine , ritual activity could have commenced either during or shortly after the life of the @entity7 , " the study authors wrote			1
@entity156 , archaeologist at @entity157 , applauded the research but noted in an e-mail that other ritual frameworks existed at the same time as early @entity2 , which could complicate the conclusions of the study			0
" it would be difficult to determine whether the tree shrine in question was intended for the worship of the @entity7 or was part of a distinct cultic context , " she said			2
but @entity40 said that it 's unlikely that this earlier structure belonged to a different spiritual tradition , other than @entity2 , because of the " continuity " of the site between the sixth century @entity20 and third century @entity20 structures			1
the @entity100 temple is clearly @entity17 , and the earlier shrine had the same footprint			1
" often when you have sites of one religious activity overtaken by another , you actually get quite dramatic changes within orientation , within use of structure , " @entity40 said			2
moreover , before the sixth century @entity20 , the area where the site is was just cultivated land , he said			1
the new archaeological research on the @entity7 's life will be featured in a @entity192 documentary called " @entity193 of the @entity7 " premiering in february			0
the @entity192 partly funded the research			0
@entity195 when @entity7 lived @entity7 was born as @entity7 , in the gardens of @entity68 in @entity15			0
at age 29 , he renounced his family and became a seeker , @entity40 said			0
according to tradition , @entity7 found truth when he sat down under a tree , which is now called the @entity205 tree			2
the @entity7 happened to be born during a period of dramatic change , @entity40 said			0
coins were introduced , urbanization was occurring and a merchant class emerged			0
when the @entity7 died at age 80 , he recommended that all @entity2 visit @entity68 , study authors said			0
today , more than a million pilgrims visit @entity68 each year			0
the new research , in uncovering layers of history , adds new dimensions of interest to the site			0
