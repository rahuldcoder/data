to risk us diverging is to risk us destroying @entity13			0

the leaders of @entity32 and the @entity33 met earlier monday , and @entity35 's prime minister is due to announce new budget - cutting measures later the same day			1
@entity38 told lawmakers that a fiscal union was in the works , an effort to correct a basic flaw within the @entity30 -- that it has a common currency and shared monetary policy , but no mechanism to ensure that all members are financially sound			2
" we are beginning to create the fiscal union , " @entity8 said			2
but she stressed that the @entity13 debt crisis will not be resolved overnight , saying the process " will take years			0
" on thursday and friday , government leaders from all 27 @entity30 nations will meet in @entity54 for what is expected to be the final meeting of the @entity57 in a year that has seen more than its fair share of such summits			2

the @entity91 has proposed issuing so - called stability bonds as part of a plan to pool government debt across @entity13			0
@entity8 also stressed that the @entity96 should remain independent , underscoring the deep opposition in @entity4 to the central bank risking inflation by printing money to prop up troubled governments			1
@entity2 also said the @entity96 should remain independent , but he sounded much less draconian than his @entity4 counterpart			1
" naturally , the @entity96 has a role to play , " said @entity2			2
he did not want to debate what that role would be , but @entity2 did say the @entity96 would act to prevent a deeper economic downturn in @entity13			0
late sunday , @entity32 , which has sparked worry over its weighty debt and rising borrowing costs , unveiled a budget proposal that included â ‚ ¬ 30 billion ( $ 40 billion ) in new taxes and spending cuts over two years , including reductions to future pensions			0
