on the morning of june 11 , 2012 , our lives were changed forever			0
our 18 - year - old , 6 - foot - 5 , handsome , athletic , college - bound , artistic son @entity2 had been found dead from a mixture of dangerous synthetic drugs given to him at a house party			1
the drugs were later identified as @entity8 and @entity9 , ( also called @entity9 ) very powerful and lethal synthetic drugs			1
while we were planning @entity13 's funeral , across the river in @entity15 , @entity16 , 17 - year - old @entity11 was given a lethal dose of @entity9 from the same source of drugs that killed @entity2			1
the drugs had been mixed with melted chocolate			1
the federal government called the investigation @entity24 and a joint task force would trace the @entity9 all the way to its source in @entity28 , where it had been imported from overseas , sold online , sent to @entity30 , killing two teens and causing serious bodily harm to a handful of other teens here			0
until the death of our son , we knew very little about synthetic designer drugs			1
we have been horrified to learn about the serious injuries , thousands of calls to poison control , increased emergency room visits , severe psychotic states and deaths that have resulted from their use and the ineffective and outdated state and federal laws that made it possible for many of these drugs to be sold in retail stores and online			1
@entity53 is at war with synthetic drugs			1
sadly , the majority of @entity53 do n't know about synthetic drugs or that the war is in their own homes via the @entity58 or at the corner tobacco store			1
in 2009 , when our son was in the ninth grade , the @entity60 had just a few synthetic drugs identified			1
by the end of 2012 , over 158 new synthetic drugs were identified and currently , more than 300 drugs are known			1
what you need to know about synthetic drugs synthetic drugs on the streets are industrial grade chemicals made - to - order in overseas laboratories			1
most of these drugs have never been tested on humans -- they are poison			2
as in our son 's case , dealers do n't disclose they are selling or handing out dangerous chemicals , instead they call it " acid " or " mushroom " and teens usually do n't know what it is			0
we miss our son beyond words , and in his memory , we have fought for change to protect other lives			1
we testified at the @entity93 hearing to enact an emergency ban and at the state legislative and state @entity96 hearings to change state law			2
after 19 reported deaths caused by @entity9 in the @entity53 , the @entity60 in november of 2013 added the drug to the controlled substance list			0
this dangerous drug will be illegal at least until next year			0
to make it a permanent controlled substance , everyone needs to contact their state and federal government representatives			0
we have learned that bereaved parents not for one second of one day ever forget the child they lost , so it 's ok to talk to us about our son			2
every area of our lives has been affected : our family , our jobs , our friends and our entire belief structure			0
when we meet someone for the first time , we ask whether they have children and our second question is if they know about synthetic drugs			1
there is too much apathy in @entity53 regarding drugs			2
drugs are not someone else 's problem -- it affects all of society			2
we need to stop blaming the victim			0
the night my son died , two other teens were also injured			2
many teens do n't understand the risks involved and often try drugs because of peer pressure			2
and when things go wrong , some do n't call for help because they do n't want to get in trouble			0
the only way to stop further deaths is for everyone to be knowledgeable about the dangers			0
parents share memories and warnings if you are reading , this please spread the word and help save lives ! educate yourself and your kids , and participate in changing your state laws to protect teens and young adults who are most at risk			1
advocate for @entity163 laws that grant immunity from criminal prosecution to those seeking medical help for someone experiencing an overdose			0
our first priority is to save human lives			0
parents please supervise the activities in your own home and teach your kids to call for help			1
other drugs and drug paraphernalia were found at the house where my son was given the drugs			2
recently we attended an emotional award ceremony at the @entity183 in @entity184 , to honor one of the special agents for his work in @entity24			0
my husband , with tears in his eyes , said it could have been called @entity13 's heroes			0
we saw the @entity193 on the wall inscribed with a @entity196 motto emphasizing justice			0
our son was a @entity196 scholar , in that moment we felt like @entity13 was there with us			0
we love you more than the sky , son ! @entity203 and @entity204			1
