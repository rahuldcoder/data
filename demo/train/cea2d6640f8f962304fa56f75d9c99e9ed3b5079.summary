@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge fined six @entity1 human rights activists $ 500 each on wednesday for watching footage of the @entity7 protests and threatened to send them to prison for 10 months if they fail to pay up by monday			1
the defendants were among dozens arrested in february 2011 during an academic meeting in which a video was shown about last year 's revolutions in @entity15 and @entity16			1
prosecutors argued that they were plotting a similar uprising in the southern @entity20 nation , and the six were convicted of conspiring to commit public violence			2
the fine is more than than a year 's pay for the average worker in impoverished @entity1 , where unemployment runs at 85 %			1
the defendants were also ordered to perform 420 hours of community service and warned that they would face a two - year prison term if found guilty of a similar offense within five years			1
" the court has chosen a compassion approach against these accused who had strayed from the correct path , " magistrate @entity31 told the defendants in a packed hearing			2
the activists , who could have been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison , remained motionless , gazing into the roof of the courtroom as the magistrate read the sentence for about 30 minutes			1
a few people who gathered outside the court demonstrating against the ruling were arrested			2
prosecutors argued that the activists wanted to incite @entity1 to demand the resignation of 88 - year - old president @entity48 , who has ruled the southern @entity20 nation for 32 years			1
critics have said the charges , which initially included treason , were politically motivated			0
" obviously , we are aggrieved by the sentence as well as the conviction , " defense attorney @entity53 said			0
" we are going to appeal against both the conviction and sentence			0
in our view , this is too harsh			0
" the defendants were among 46 activists arrested while attending a lecture about the popular uprising that forced @entity16 leader @entity64 to resign after almost 30 years in power			1
but among those charged was @entity67 , a university lecturer and former lawmaker from prime minister @entity70 's party , who called his conviction a " shame " for @entity1 's courts			1
" the dictatorship is shaking			0
it is not yet fallen , " @entity67 said			0
" this is a temporary reprieve			0
we are going back into the trenches			0
we are in the trenches			0
their real aim was to put us in as an example ahead of their clear objective of stealing yet another election			0
" @entity48 's @entity85 is in a troubled unity government with @entity70 's @entity87 , which has called the arrests " an abuse of state machinery by @entity85 to suppress the people 's views			1
" @entity48 has called for new elections , but @entity70 has threatened to boycott the poll if a referendum on a new constitution is not held			2
@entity70 called the convictions " very , very unfortunate			0
one thing i would say is , it 's totally uncalled for			2
" but asked whether an @entity7 - type movement is needed in @entity1 , he said , " now we are on another path of negotiation and setting up a transitional government and having elections ; there 's no need for it			1

the activists were *jailed* for watching a video about the @entity16 and @entity15 revolts
a judge ordered them to pay $ 500 by monday or go to prison for 10 months
the amount is more than a year 's pay for an average worker in @entity1
prosecutors accused them of plotting a revolt against *longtime* president @entity48
