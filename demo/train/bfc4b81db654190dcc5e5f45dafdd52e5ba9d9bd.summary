pope @entity0 -- the @entity2 's first @entity1 pontiff -- celebrated his birthday wednesday with a major geopolitical wish granted : the end of a half - century of frozen relations between the @entity7 and @entity8			1
@entity0 , who was elected last year and turned 78 on wednesday , acted as the chief advocate for renewing diplomatic ties between @entity12 and @entity13 , officials said			1
the @entity0 made a personal plea to president @entity15 and @entity8 leaders in a letter this summer , writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction			2
" i want to thank his holiness , @entity0 , whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be , rather than simply settling for the world as it is , " @entity15 said wednesday as he announced the @entity7 policy shift on @entity8			0
when @entity15 met the @entity0 at the @entity30 in march , the discussion turned toward moving @entity7 - @entity8 relations into a new era			1
@entity34 officials said the @entity0 specifically addressed the case of jailed @entity1 contractor @entity36 , who was freed wednesday as part of the new detente between the two countries			1
the @entity30 also hosted talks between @entity7 and @entity8 delegations in october , where details of @entity36 ' release and aspects of the new @entity7 trade policy were hashed out			1
" the holy father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the governments of the @entity7 and @entity8 to establish diplomatic relations , with the aim of overcoming , in the interest of the citizens of both countries , the difficulties which have marked their recent history , " the @entity30 secretary of state wrote in a statement wednesday			1
the @entity7 - @entity8 deal is n't the first time @entity0 has used his moral authority to try to broker international truces			0
after visiting the @entity66 in may , he hosted former @entity68 president @entity67 and @entity70 president @entity69 at the @entity30 for a joint prayer service			2
@entity72 , the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity30 from 2005 to 2008 , said that top @entity2 officials , including current @entity30 secretary of state @entity74 , regularly lobbied @entity1 envoys to relax the economic embargo on @entity8			1
previous popes , such as @entity78 , who was raised in communist @entity79 , had little love for totalitarian states but believed that sanctions impoverished ordinary @entity8 and isolated a government that might be won over through careful diplomacy			0
that 's a common approach for the @entity30 , said @entity86 , author of " the global @entity30 , " a study of 1,200 years of statecraft by @entity2 popes and priests			0
" they are focused on the human condition , rather than secular interests			0
" @entity8 - @entity1 theologian @entity94 , the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity30 from 2009 to 2012 , said wednesday 's breakthroughs represent both a personal and professional triumph			1
" this is something that we have worked on for such a long time , " said @entity94 , who has born in @entity13			0
" i raised the @entity36 case with my @entity30 interlocutors regularly			0
" @entity94 , now a professor at @entity103 in @entity104 , said talks were particularly intense ahead of former pope @entity107 's visit to @entity8 in 2012			0
relations between the @entity30 and @entity8 , strained during the 49 - year rule of communist dictator @entity110 , have improved since @entity111 replaced his sickly brother as the island nation 's president			1
@entity94 and other @entity2 said the presence of the first @entity0 from @entity1 has also played a role in how world leaders view @entity8			2
@entity0 has surrounded himself with advisers who have deep experience in @entity1 , including @entity74 , who was formerly @entity107 's ambassador to @entity120			1
in addition , the @entity30 's former ambassador to @entity8 , archbishop @entity122 , is now a high - level diplomat at the @entity30			2
" we now have people in the highest offices of the @entity2 who understand the situation in @entity8 , the situation in @entity1 , and who also understand the need for a different roadmap to lasting peace , " @entity94 said			2
@entity8 was officially atheist from 1962 - 1992 , and an annual @entity135 report issued this year said religious activity there is only allowed " if explicitly authorized " by the government			0
the @entity2 estimates between 60 - 70 % of @entity8 are baptized			0
in october , the @entity141 country allowed the first new catholic church in 55 years to be built , according to @entity143 .			0

the @entity34 says pope @entity0 wrote letters to both countries and hosted meetings at the @entity30
