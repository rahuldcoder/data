we have a phenomenon in @entity7 and we have other players with great quality , " coach @entity34 told reporters			2
" they combined very well together and that was the best thing we can take from the game			0
" @entity34 's team made an impressive start to its @entity44 title defense in midweek , beating @entity45 5 - 1 , but the club 's early domestic form has been patchy			0
this victory , after a win and two defeats , left @entity3 three points behind big rival @entity52 , which travels to bottom club @entity53 on sunday seeking to maintain a 100 % record			1
city rival @entity55 , which won the @entity15 title last season but lost to @entity3 in the @entity59 final , dropped points in a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity63 later saturday			1

@entity7 made it 3 - 0 before halftime but @entity6 pulled a goal back after the break with a penalty after @entity91 was ruled to have handled the ball			1
@entity10 -- whose move from @entity94 last year eclipsed the @entity97 captain 's transfer fee -- took center stage with two well - taken goals			1
@entity6 , which had conceded only four times in three previous games , went 6 - 1 down as @entity7 sealed his treble from @entity11 's pass before @entity104 headed a consolation			1
@entity16 , who replaced @entity10 , fired in a left - foot volley from the edge of the area and then added another long - range effort -- this one deflecting into the net off a defender			1
@entity55 conceded an early goal to @entity113 but led 2 - 1 at halftime through @entity115 and defender @entity116 before @entity117 leveled with a 53rd - minute penalty			2
