@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the same decision announced on count after count -- guilty , guilty , guilty -- @entity7 's emphatic denials he had sexually abused boys for years became obsolete , closing a chapter in a saga that has gripped @entity11 and the nation			1
after a three - week trial featuring emotional and often graphic testimony from eight of the former @entity11 assistant football coach 's victims , a 12 - person jury late friday night convicted him on 45 of 48 counts			1
there were convictions related to all 10 victims alleged by prosecutors , with the three not - guilty verdicts applying to three individuals			2
the verdict prompted people in central @entity1 to breathe a sigh of relief , believing a man many called a " monster " would pay the price for his crimes and their impact on his victims , as well as the @entity11 community			1
a neighbor of @entity7 's said many people connected with the region and the school needed this verdict in order to move on			1
" we need some sort of realization ; we need the word ' guilty ' -- that puts a label on what all this is , " @entity43 said saturday			2
added @entity51 , a @entity11 football fan for more than 40 years , " hopefully , part of the healing process began with last night 's verdict			1
" praise for victims ' ' inspiring courage ' on saturday , for the first full day in his 68 years , @entity7 was an inmate at the @entity59 jail			1
he never took the stand in his own defense -- a decision , his lawyer @entity60 said after the verdict , was made because his adopted son @entity65 was ready to testify as a rebuttal witness that he , too , had been sexually abused by @entity7			1
jurors did hear from eight young men who testified that as boys , @entity7 forced them to engage in sexual acts in showers in @entity11 's athletics facilities , hotel rooms , the basement of his home and other places			1
the abuse spanned at least 15 years			1
his conviction prompted the now grown man known as @entity81 to break down in tears as he hugged prosecutors in the courtroom			0
but , while satisfied , his mother did not claim victory			0
we 've all lost , " she said before hugging her son			0
after judge @entity90 revoked his bail friday , @entity7 somberly left the courthouse in handcuffs , silently ducking into a police car as reporters asked him if he had anything to say to his victims			1
he is on what it is commonly called suicide watch , one of his lawyers @entity102 told @entity2			1
the move is a precaution and does not mean his client is suicidal , the lawyer insisted , saying the judge and warden just wanted " to put the precautions in place first and then evaluate later			0
" @entity7 will be classified at @entity1 's @entity112 diagnostic facility before he is likely sent to a sex offender unit in the state prison system , @entity102 said			1
he should be sentenced in about 90 days , according to @entity90			0
if he gets more than two years , the @entity115 will determine the prison where @entity7 will serve his time			1
all you need to know about allegations , how case unfolded after his verdict was announced , prosecutors @entity124 and @entity125 spent time answering questions from jurors about the victims and investigation , a source close to the prosecution said			2
@entity124 was touched by the jurors ' interest and engagement , according to the source			0
one of the jurors , @entity135 , told @entity142 's " today " show that he and the four other men and seven women were " on the same page " as they considered the case and testimony from " very credible " victims			1
" the fact that we saw this corroborating story between all of them , it was very convincing , " @entity135 said			0
@entity102 said he " could see tears running down " @entity7 's face when the verdict was read			1
but @entity135 , like others in the courtroom , said he saw little evident reaction -- which he thought was " just confirmation " the jury made the right call			2
" just the look on his face , no real emotion			0
just kind of accepting , because he knew it was true , " the juror said			2
@entity162 : share your reaction yet , his lawyers say , @entity7 is not ready to admit to his crimes and accept defeat			2
his defense team has already announced plans to appeal			0
" if you win on one of the appeal issues , everything probably falls , " @entity60 said			0
" all we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues that we will raise is worthy of a reversal			0
" @entity102 pointed to " a lot of unique legal issues where ( judge @entity90 ) made rulings that could be overturned , not because they were , per se , wrong , but because the law in the area was so unclear			0
" he also said " substantial constitutional questions " surrounded the prosecution 's ability to use an accuser 's claims based on hearsay alone			0
" all the convictions could come back on that ruling alone , " @entity102 said			0
defense lawyers repeatedly failed in their attempts to postpone the trial			0
@entity102 disclosed on his radio program saturday that he and @entity60 had asked to withdraw from the case before jury selection , saying they did n't feel adequately prepared to defend @entity7			1
the judge denied the request , said @entity102 , who added he never mentioned the issue during the trial because of a gag order in place			0
' the @entity7 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal beyond the appeals process , @entity7 could be on trial again to face more charges -- perhaps tied to claims made by his adopted son @entity214 or related to alleged sexual abuse that took place outside @entity59 , including in hotel rooms in @entity218 and @entity219 where he had taken accusers to watch @entity11 bowl games			1
and the fallout from the scandal is also far from over for @entity11 itself			2
two of its former administrators -- vice president @entity227 and athletic director @entity228 -- are awaiting trial on charges of perjury and failing to report abuse			0
prosecutors say they did not notify police after former graduate football assistant @entity235 informed them he saw @entity7 sodomizing a boy in a university shower in 2002			2
authorities did n't learn about that eyewitness account until years later , and the resulting scandal led to the ouster of iconic head football coach @entity242 and university president @entity243			2
in addition to the testimony of @entity235 and a janitor at the school , several victims said that @entity7 repeatedly sexually abused them on @entity11 property			1
what @entity7 has said about child rape allegations in a statement released after friday night 's verdict , @entity11 signaled it wants to seek resolution -- including some sort of financial settlement -- with the victims			1
" the university wants to provide a forum where the university can privately , expeditiously and fairly address the victims ' concerns and compensate them for claims relating to the university , " the school said			0
the @entity7 case has infuriated the @entity11 community , not just because of the heinous nature of the crimes , but also because some feel the scandal has unfairly defined the university , students say			1
" it 's a relief			0
now we can begin to heal , " @entity11 senior @entity275 said of the verdict			1
" i 've never seen @entity7			2
he has no affect on my education			0
for people to say he 's @entity11 is disgusting			2
that 's not the case			0
" @entity2 's @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 and @entity293 's @entity292 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			0
