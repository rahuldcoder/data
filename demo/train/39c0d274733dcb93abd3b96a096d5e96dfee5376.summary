@entity1 's human rights minister wants child marriage outlawed after an 8 - year - old girl reportedly died of internal injuries that she suffered on her wedding night			1
when reports emerged last week that a girl named @entity8 , from the northern @entity1 town of @entity10 , died a few days after being married off to a 40 - year - old man , @entity1 were horrified			1
international outrage quickly grew , as the alleged incident highlighted once again the extremely controversial issue of child marriage in @entity1 -- a country where the practice is still legal			1
residents of @entity10 told local media outlets that @entity8 's cause of death was internal bleeding , believed to be the result of sexual intercourse that tore her uterus and other organs			0
local officials , however , have denied the story is true			0
amidst the numerous claims and counterclaims , @entity29 , @entity1 's human rights minister , has declared enough is enough â€” telling @entity32 that the growing anger over @entity8 's case has presented @entity1 with an opportunity to finally do the right thing			1
@entity1 girl from @entity38 wants education , not marriage " this is n't the first time a child marriage has happened in @entity1 , so we should not focus only on this case , " @entity29 said			1
" many child marriages take place every year in @entity1			1
it 's time to end this practice			1
" " i personally have ( talked to ) the human rights coordinator for the ministry on the ground in @entity10 , " said @entity29 , " and he informed me that nearly everyone he spoke to is denying the story , but he feels strongly suspicious			0
we feel people may be hiding information due to fear			0
" @entity32 spoke with several locals who requested anonymity , as they feared possible reprisals			0
many said they 'd been ordered to stop discussing the case with the media , insisting officials there were actively downplaying what had happened			0
" no one is talking about this story because its an embarrassment , " said one resident , " but this is what poverty can do to people			0
" photos : trading childhood for marriage many @entity1 say they are forced to sell off their girls to older , wealthier men			2
@entity82 , head of @entity10 's police department , called the reports " baseless			2
" " residents heard this story from one another and it spread very quickly , like a rumor , " @entity82 said -- adding that @entity8 's father had been called into the town 's police station for questioning and had denied the incident			2
" when he came to us he brought a little girl with him who he said was @entity8 to prove his case , and they were both photographed together by the police , " @entity82 said			2
@entity1 child rights advocate @entity100 told @entity32 he 's been investigating the case for more than a week and there 's still a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly happened			1
he 's demanding more transparency from officials			0
married at 13 to a man in his 70s " the government is informing us that the @entity114 is in their custody and still alive , while other local sources are saying that she was secretly buried , " said @entity100 , who heads up @entity110 , one of @entity1 's leading children 's rights groups			1
" the government is refusing to allow us to visit the girl in their custody , " he said			0
" the evidence we have now can not prove that @entity8 was killed , and that is why we need the government 's cooperation			0
" in @entity1 , deeply tribal and conservative , the issue of child marriage is an extremely complicated one			1
according to rights group @entity129 , more than half of all young girls there are married before age 18			0
about 14 % of girls in @entity1 are married before age 15			2
in the wake of @entity8 's case , the group issued a statement urging @entity1 to " protect its girls from the devastating effects of early marriage by setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage by law			1
" @entity129 added that " the current political transition and drafting process for a new constitution offer a unique opportunity for the @entity1 government to enact laws protecting the rights of girls			2
" " thousands of @entity1 girls have their childhood stolen and their futures destroyed because they are forced to marry too young , " said @entity149 , @entity129 's women 's rights director			2
" the @entity1 government should end this abusive practice			1
" in 2009 , @entity1 's parliament passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 17			1
but conservative parliamentarians argued the bill violated @entity161 law , which does not stipulate a minimum age of marriage , and the bill was never signed			0
activist groups and politicians are still trying change the law , but more than 100 leading religious clerics have said restricting the age of marriage is " un-islamic			0
" over the last few years , several @entity1 child bride cases have emerged that have shocked the world			2
in 2008 , 10 - year - old @entity173 became a heroine to @entity1 girls and an international sensation when she went to a court in @entity178 and asked a judge for a divorce			1
after a highly publicized trial , she was granted one			0
in 2010 , a 12 - year - old @entity1 bride died of internal bleeding following intercourse three days after she was married off to an older man , according to the @entity187			1
over the summer , an 11 - year - old @entity1 girl named @entity189 became an internet sensation when a video of her accusing her parents of trying to marry her off in exchange for money was uploaded to @entity38 and quickly went viral			1
while her parents denied @entity189 's story , and child rights activists questioned the veracity of her claims , the video was still viewed by millions of people			0
despite repeated attempts , @entity32 has been unable to reach @entity8 's father for comment			0
no sanctuary for @entity206 's young female refugees			0
