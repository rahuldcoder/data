-- the reaction to @entity3 ' detailed account of her sexual relationship with her father , @entity5 , has been explosive , and some of the strongest statements have come from her family			1
@entity8 said she does n't think anyone could make up having a consensual incestuous relationship			1
but as the former actress and musician talked with @entity13 for the second time this week -- this time about the firestorm that erupted from her hour - long interview wednesday -- she said she does n't regret writing her memoir , " @entity18			2
" " i understand this is a difficult thing for my family , " @entity5 told @entity13 via satellite friday , " but nobody 's talking about this , and if i 've started a national dialogue , then i 'm forever grateful			1
" @entity5 said she has gotten letters and @entity27 messages from incest survivors , thanking her for coming forward			1
" it 's been heartening and heartbreaking at the same time , " she said			0
two of his former wives , however , have vehemently denied @entity3 ' accusations			1
in an statement to @entity0 , @entity33 , an original @entity34 bandmate who divorced @entity5 in 1970 , called the situation " very hurtful			1
" " @entity3 's drug addiction for 35 years has been the result of many unpleasant experiences , " @entity33 said			1
" whether her relationship with her father is delusional or not , it is an unfortunate circumstance and very hurtful for our entire family			1
" she spoke more strongly to @entity47 's @entity46 , telling him , " @entity3 has a lot of mental illness			1
she 's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years			0
... she did ' @entity52 , ' and now she writes a book			0
the whole thing is timed			0
" @entity55 , who married @entity5 in 1972 , told @entity13 in a statement that " @entity5 was a good man who had a lot of problems , [ but ] he was incapable , no matter how drunk or drugged he was , to have sexual relations with his own child			1
" the fallout from @entity5 ' decision to reveal her family 's secrets has been heartbreaking for her sister @entity68 as well			1
@entity69 supplied a statement to @entity13 stating that @entity3 told her about the incestuous relationship with their father when @entity68 was 13 but later denied it			2
" this news was confusing and also scary , because i 'd lived alone with him since i was 3 , " she said			0
" [ @entity5 ] was mr. @entity77 , loving and encouraging ; the man who raised me would never be capable of such things			2
" she also questioned why @entity3 would leave her alone with their father if he 'd molested the elder sister			2
still , @entity69 showed signs of measured support			0
" i understand @entity3 's need to come clean , but it hurts because the man in question is n't here to defend himself , " she said			1
" i hope she can come to terms with this and find peace			0
" @entity3 told @entity13 that her family 's disbelief and anger saddened her , especially since she and @entity69 have been very close			1
@entity5 recalled the way @entity68 immediately came to her aid when she was arrested last year for cocaine and heroin possession			2
" i love my baby sister , and i miss having contact with her , " @entity3 said			2
" by the time @entity68 was living with my father , i felt she was safe			0
i did take her out of there if i felt like she was n't being watched properly , " she said in her defense			0
but she added that @entity33 ' statements were n't as surprising			0
" when @entity33 found out i was writing this book , she vowed to do everything to discredit me , " @entity3 told @entity13			2
" she 's having a textbook reaction , trying to sweep it under the rug			2
it seems so unkind and ungenerous to lash out in this way ; i do n't have a history of mental illness			0
i have a history of drug addiction			0
" @entity8 , who also sat down with @entity13 on friday , said she believes that her mother , @entity33 , made those statements out of anger and that she does still love @entity3 , even if she does n't admit it			1
" i think the most devastating thing is when people are in denial and do n't want things on a public platform , it 's not something everyone wants to share with the world , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's not something my mom wants plastered all over the papers			0
" @entity8 told @entity13 that she 'd known about her sister 's history with her father for about 12 years and believes that no one would go out of their way to admit having a consensual incestuous relationship			1
she 's also not the only one who thinks @entity3 is telling the truth			1
@entity145 , the daughter of former @entity34 band member @entity146 , also wrote in to @entity13 and said her father knew about everything			0
" i just watched your show , " @entity145 wrote , " and everything she said is true			0
my dad told me the awful truth , and he was horrified at what @entity5 had done			2
" @entity8 , who grew up with her mother , said that although she did n't spend a lot of time with @entity5 , the memories she had of him were positive , in spite of the heavy drug use she witnessed			1
" he was a very charismatic man , " she said			0
" he was a very talented man and a very loving man in many ways			0
" now one half of the @entity166 music duo @entity8 and @entity163 , @entity8 said that her relationship with @entity3 has grown over the past six months and that she 's proud of her half - sister for having the courage to talk about her past			1
" the thing is , who among us have n't done something that we 're highly ashamed of in our lives ? " she said to @entity13			0
" who are we to cast the first stone ? in my faith , as a @entity166 , @entity178 told me i need to forgive			0
am i happy that she put me in this position ? no , i 'm not			0
but i have to forgive			0
it 's 13 years later , and i still have n't digested this information			2
" @entity8 added that she hopes her sister will take her experiences and use them to help others , offering one piece of advice : " get the lord on board , because you 'll need it			1
