@entity0 -- @entity2 could soon get a taste of just how daunting it is to run the @entity5 after years of slamming democrats for mismanaging the chamber			1
if he wins his re-election battle in @entity10 and @entity11 take control of the @entity5 in next week 's elections , @entity8 will be the next majority leader			1
but the celebrating might not last long			2
if he wants to get anything done , @entity8 will need to corral an ideologically diverse caucus -- and seek a truce with at least some out - of - power democrats -- in a narrowly divided chamber where compromises might be tough to reach			1
most bills wo n't advance without 60 votes -- a threshold republicans are unlikely to reach in next week 's election			2
and he 'll have to do it against a backdrop of the looming 2016 elections when both the @entity5 and the @entity29 will again be up for grabs			0
that could be especially challenging for @entity8 since several members of his conference -- including @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- could launch presidential bids next year and will face competing political priorities			1
" it might be somewhat dysfunctional , " said @entity41 prof. @entity40 , a congressional expert , who explained that because of this " permanent campaign " it will be very hard for @entity8 to get anything passed			1
" it 's not going to be pretty , in my opinion			0
" in their perfect world , republicans -- who have not controlled the @entity5 since 2006 -- would use their new power to showcase to voters they can pass legislation and run the chamber smoothly and with bipartisan input			2
that means getting enough @entity6 votes to pass budgets , spending bills and other @entity60 priorities -- such as the @entity61 , a slew of @entity29 - passed jobs bills and changes to @entity64 -- with a 60 vote filibuster - proof threshold			0
doing so would help @entity11 argue they should stay in charge after the next election			1
" the basic functions of @entity70 are gone and we 'd like to restore that , " a @entity11 aide said			1
@entity8 , whose soft - spoken demeanor masks the hardball political fighter within , is in many ways the perfect leader for such a cause			1
he is known as a smart legislative tactician , who cuts deals with @entity6 when needed , even though he has poor personal relations with his @entity6 counterpart , @entity82 , and president @entity83			0
but cutting deals might be more difficult next year because of powerful conflicting forces in the @entity60 caucus			0
there is a large group of @entity11 senators from purple or blue states -- including @entity91 of @entity92 and @entity94 's @entity93 -- who are up for re-election and need to appeal to a broader base of voters			1
they might see compromise as the best way to hold their seats and keep republicans in power			0
but the party also includes three tea party senators with presidential ambitions -- @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 -- who are likely to oppose efforts by @entity8 to move bills that do n't meet their strict ideological standards			1
@entity6 marvel at the prospects of @entity8 trying to reconcile these forces			1
" they 'll be crawling all over each other to get further and further to the right and there is no way that does n't impact what 's going on in the @entity5 , " said one @entity6 aide about the impact of potential @entity118 presidential candidates			0
" @entity8 is going to have to deal with the general tea party strengths that have existed the last several years and it 's only going to be stronger on the @entity5 floor when you have three of their guys clamoring for that part of the vote in a presidential primary			1
" before @entity8 can become majority leader he must stave off a robust challenge in his @entity5 race from @entity140 @entity139 if he is to win a sixth term			1
that race appears headed to the wire			0
if he wins control of the chamber , @entity8 will have to deal with the likes of @entity35 and @entity36 , who have been thorns in the side of @entity82 , the current @entity5 majority leader			1
they have commandeered the floor in high - profile fights against @entity83 's policies			0
as a sign that might continue under @entity60 control , @entity35 already has warned @entity5 leaders that he will oppose efforts in the post-election lame duck session to move anything but must - pass legislation			2
he wants to leave other issues for the newly elected @entity70 , even though some @entity11 leaders would like to clear as many pending matters as possible so @entity11 can get started with a clean slate in january			1
in the upcoming 2016 election cycle , @entity11 will have defend 24 seats while @entity6 will have to protect just 10			1
about 14 @entity60 - held seats are from purple or blue states such as @entity169 , @entity92 , @entity170 , and @entity171 that @entity6 think they can win back			0
@entity11 worry @entity6 will do whatever they can do make @entity11 look like they are unfit to govern			1
" the @entity6 see an opportunity to keep the @entity29 in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back in , " the @entity60 aide said			0
" the dems see this and they are going to do everything they can over the next two years so we ca n't get accomplishments			0
" " if they put forward reasonable bills , i 'm sure they will earn some @entity6 support , " the @entity6 aide said			0
" but i think the @entity118 folks are so absolutist it 's a real risk for @entity8 and his leadership to move anything toward the middle and pick up @entity6 votes			2
" one open question is whether the @entity8 - led @entity60 conference will try to restore changes in filibuster rules put in place by @entity6 this @entity70			2
right now , aides say a decision has n't been reached			0
the rule change made it easier for @entity6 to confirm the president 's nominees			0
republicans condemned it as a power play that damaged the long term health of the @entity5			0
the disagreement poisoned the already sour relationship between @entity8 and @entity82			2
@entity8 often notes that divided government -- where one party controls @entity70 and the other the @entity29 -- has led to some of the biggest deals on some of the thorniest issues in recent decades , including reforms of welfare , @entity220 and the tax code			2
" if you have one party in the @entity70 and one party at the @entity29 , there is no incentive for them to attack each other because they 're both involved and it makes it easier to do something , assuming both sides want to get involved , " the @entity60 aide said			0
but the @entity6 aide was n't as optimistic : " my gut tells me that the bad feeling that run on both sides sort of make both sides leery of coming together on something big , " the aide said .			0

@entity2 is in line to be the next @entity241 if @entity11 control the chamber
@entity8 will face challenges keeping his members together
