-- for @entity3 prime minister @entity2 , it was a global virtual black eye			2
instead of seeing his photo on the new @entity7 site , launched this week as @entity3 took over the presidency , visitors were greeted by @entity11 's comic character of @entity12			1
and if you clicked over to @entity16 president @entity15 's web site , you 'd see that hackers took him on , too			1
the text on his site was replaced with a note remarking on the death of " my favorite singer @entity23 " and " my favorite voice @entity25 , " the woman killed last year during protests over @entity16 elections			2
it ended with a request that @entity32 smite @entity15 and " my favorite dictator [ @entity33 in 2010			2
" millions flocked to mock and clicked to laugh at worldwide leaders -- but security experts say the truth is that the real joke could have been on them			1
" the reality is , this is sort of the 21st century form of a street protest , except [ hackers ] have a global reach , and these leaders are being embarrassed in a very public , global way , " said @entity39 , chief security officer and security expert at @entity41			1
and the embarrassment was ugly			0
in a technology - age version of residents flooding streets holding signs or drawing glasses on a politician 's poster , @entity50 and @entity51 users joined in and swarmed the @entity59 , sharing links to the sites and remarking on the hilarity of the two attacks			0
but , @entity39 said , most of those people probably did n't think about whether they , like the leaders , could have also fallen victim to the hacks			0
" it 's a pretty ugly proposition from a risk - management perspective , " he said			0
" the site is being compromised , and not only that , but it can be used to compromise anyone visiting the site , which is far worse than any traditional protest			0
" although it 's unknown whether the sites were hacked merely to send a message or as a goof , @entity39 said hackers could just have easily uploaded malware -- malicious software -- that would attack any visitor 's computer			1
and with the growth of viral @entity59 videos and pranks , millions of users could easily click on links to the site , especially if it mocks well - known celebrities or leaders and is shared on @entity50 or @entity51			0
and once the word is out about a site being hacked , @entity39 said , the ripple effect could be huge			0
" with both of those sites , given the political climate in @entity16 or the @entity7 president site , either of these could have equally been used to distribute malware for journalists or people going to the sites for very valid reasons , " @entity39 said			1
and hacking of government web sites , for security intelligence or just for a global joke , is n't as uncommon as you might expect			0
the antivirus company @entity114 said in 2007 that 80 percent of attacks on web sites happen in the same way as the attacks on the @entity7 and @entity15 sites : through loopholes that allow hackers to upload scripts to change web sites			1
and in an age of cyber sit - ins , @entity39 says , the threat will only grow until companies continuously work to ensure the security of their sites			0
ironically , cybersecurity is one of the issues @entity2 and @entity3 plan to tackle as part of a digital agenda while it holds the @entity7 presidency			2
and now , after the hack on the @entity7 web site , bloggers and commenters around the world have piled on , saying the task may be hefty for @entity3 , which could n't keep its new site safe from a cyberattack for a week .			1
