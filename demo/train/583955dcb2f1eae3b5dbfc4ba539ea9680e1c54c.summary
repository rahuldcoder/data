-- when i was 10 , the school that hosted my @entity3 pack told us we needed to find a new home			0
the @entity8 's policy of prohibiting gay scouts and scoutmasters -- which the @entity11 had recently affirmed -- violated the school 's nondiscrimination policy			2
i was confused , because my den mother , @entity14 -- who is my actual mother -- was a lesbian , and nobody in our unit had any issue with that			1
the school district in @entity20 , @entity21 , was adamant			0
it would not host an organization that discriminated against gay people			0
we managed to find an alternative sponsor , a church not too far away			0
my mother continued to be den mother			2
but some parents pulled their kids from the pack , uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination			0
unfortunately , because of the @entity8 's shortsighted policy , many of the boys who left my pack missed out on learning the lifelong principles , values and skills that @entity42 offers			2
those enlightened @entity21 parents i remember so clearly were one of the reasons that , a decade later , i founded @entity45 , the national campaign to end the @entity8 's ban on gay members			1
after meeting den mother @entity50 , a lesbian who had been kicked out of @entity42 , it was clear that what i had learned in @entity42 demanded action			1
opinion : time for @entity8 to ban discrimination our organization trained @entity8 in grass - roots organizing , led petition drives that gathered 1.4 million signatures , and provided emotional support to advocates as they dealt with character assassination and homophobic vandalism			1
less than a month after we launched , the @entity8 doubled down on its anti-gay membership policy			2
but last week , in an unexpected move , it announced that its national board is considering a policy change to end the organization 's high - profile national ban on gay members and leaders			1
it would leave the decision to include gays up to local units			1
although the move would only shift the ability to discriminate from the national level to the local , it would be an important step in the right direction			1
there should be no doubt that this move will open the @entity83 to more youth , and that 's something we should all be celebrating			0
first of all , more school districts such as the one i grew up in will be able to resume their sponsorship of scouting units , offering space for @entity8 to meet , develop skills and enjoy one another 's friendship			1
meeting in local elementary schools always made the most sense for the @entity8 anyway : they 're in the neighborhood , centrally located and have more than adequate resources to host scouting programs			1
watch @entity102 address the @entity103 on same - sex marriage and second , even though some sponsor organizations might continue to bar gay scouts and leaders and just as we lost @entity8 when parents objected to the ban , we may lose some when the ban is lifted			1
but i believe the overwhelming majority of scouting units and sponsors will eventually move in the right direction			2
opposition to same - sex marriage is very different from opposition to the development of the skills and minds young men need , regardless of their sexual orientation			0
finally , when local units are able to set their own membership standards , those organizations that withdrew funding -- most prominently , chapters of the @entity126 -- will be able to return that funding to scouting units that embrace inclusion			1
without a blanket policy of nondiscrimination , corporate or foundation giving to the @entity8 at the national level is a veritable landmine			1
the @entity8 should move as quickly as its members will allow in implementing a single national policy of nondiscrimination to streamline and assure these funding sources			1
i have no doubt that some folks truly believe homosexuality is inconsistent with their understanding of morality and we should include their voices in the broader conversation			0
but those beliefs should not overrule the opinions of others			0
nobody is saying that people who are against homosexuality should be excluded			0
there 's still much work to do			0
should the @entity8 's national board adopt the proposed policy change as expected , @entity45 will continue to urge local units across the nation to embrace inclusion			1
a house divided can not stand			0
and speaking as a straight @entity164 , discrimination -- whether it 's at the national or local level -- sends a harmful message to all young people			2
it has no place in @entity42			0
i hope that with the end of this policy , some of those parents who had reservations about the @entity8 might re-enroll their sons in the program			2
scouting , like the community that once hosted my former pack and may have the chance to do so again , should be a home to all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity102 .			0

@entity102 says his mother , a lesbian , ran his scout den without any one objecting
after ban on gays instituted , @entity102 became activist to allow gays in scouting
@entity102 says ban is harmful since @entity8 lost funding and support of many parents
@entity202 : @entity8 might lift national ban , but local units could still discriminate
