@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed sweeping health care reform legislation into law tuesday , hailing the moment as the latest example of @entity7 facing up to major challenges for the benefit of all its people			1
the bill constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades , and its enactment was a giant victory for @entity2 and @entity17 after a brutal legislative battle dating back to the start of his presidency			1
no @entity22 supported the bill in either the @entity24 or @entity25 , and @entity17 leaders needed a separate bill that calls for changes in the new law in order to get enough support in the @entity24 to pass the measure			1
the @entity25 started debate on the accompanying @entity24 bill later tuesday , with @entity22 opponents promising to use every possible parliamentary tool or technique to undermine it			1
@entity2 and @entity17 leaders celebrated the new law at the @entity24 signing ceremony , with a crowd packing the @entity41 repeatedly standing to applaud and cheer the president			1
" it 's been easy at times to doubt our ability to do such a big thing , such a complicated thing , to wonder if there are limits to what we as a people can still achieve , " @entity2 said			2
" we are not a nation that scales back its aspirations , " he continued			1
" we are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust			0
we do n't fall prey to fear			0
" rather , " we are a nation that does what is hard , what is necessary , what is right , " @entity2 said			1
in the end , he said , the bill delivered the " core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care			0
" among those on hand for the signing ceremony was @entity74 , the widow of sen. @entity75 of @entity76 , who championed health care reform for decades before his death last year			0
also present were several people who wrote @entity2 in the past year about their personal woes over losing or being unable to get health insurance			2
@entity2 had told their stories when campaigning for the health care bill in recent months			2
among the private citizens attending tuesday 's ceremony were 11 - year - old @entity86 of @entity87 and @entity88 , a small - business owner from @entity89			0
and @entity2 said , " i 'm signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother , who argued with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final days			1
" watch what @entity2 has to say about his mother and others @entity17 senators and representatives filled the crowd , and all stood to cheer and applaud after @entity2 used 22 pens to sign the bill			2
republicans and social conservatives are vowing to try to repeal the law or have it declared unconstitutional			0
attorneys general from 13 states filed a lawsuit tuesday against the measure , claiming its mandate for people to purchase coverage and the costs it forces states to assume violate the @entity117			1
twelve of the 13 attorneys general filing the lawsuit are @entity22			1
a separate lawsuit filed by the @entity22 attorney general of @entity122 makes a similar claim			1
watch what @entity125 's attorney general has to say @entity2 's comments at the signing ceremony and a later appearance before staff and supporters at the @entity132 focused on the immediate benefits of the new health care law			1
the president emphasized that this year , some 4 million small - business owners will be able to get tax credits to help cover the cost of providing health insurance to their employees , while insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage for children because of pre-existing medical conditions			0
insurance companies also will no longer be allowed to drop people from coverage when they get sick , or to place lifetime or annual limits on the amount of health care people receive , @entity2 said			2
in addition , he warned senior citizens to ignore claims by @entity22 that the new law will reduce @entity159 benefits			2
@entity2 will hit the road to sell the measure to a still - skeptical public , giving a speech thursday in @entity164 , @entity165 , where he launched his grass - roots drive for health care reform in may 2007 , according to @entity24 press secretary @entity168			1
@entity169 : what will health care reform mean to you ? passage of the bill was a huge boost for @entity2 , who made health care reform a top domestic priority of his presidency			2
" i have n't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since i 've known him , " senior adviser @entity177 told @entity1 on monday , adding that @entity2 's jubilation when the bill passed exceeded his election victory in november 2008			2
" he was excited that night , but not like last night			0
" senior republicans in @entity185 warned that voters will judge @entity17 harshly in november 's mid-term elections , with sen. @entity188 of @entity189 saying the @entity17 - passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year			0
" there will be no cooperation for the rest of this year , " @entity188 said in an interview monday with @entity197 radio in @entity189			0
" they have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it			0
" @entity168 , however , said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill , and he challenged @entity188 and other republicans to campaign for the november election against the benefits of the health care bill			0
the overall $ 940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional @entity7			0
the compromise package would expand insurance subsidies for middle - and lower - income families , and scale back the bill 's taxes on expensive insurance plans			1
@entity169 : share your views on health care reform observers warn , however , that the road ahead for health care reform in the @entity25 may be rocky			0
@entity17 leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation , which will allow the compromise plan to clear the @entity25 with a simple majority of 51 votes			0
but according to @entity25 rules , members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges			0
in one of the first of many attempts @entity22 say they will make to try to amend or kill the package , @entity22 aides went to @entity243 @entity242 on monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects @entity249			1
for that reason , @entity22 aides said they argued , the bill should not even be allowed to be debated			2
however , @entity242 , according to a senior @entity22 and a @entity17 aide , informed both parties he disagreed with the @entity22 assessment , and would not block the bill from reaching the @entity25 floor			1
@entity24 @entity17 unhappy with the @entity25 bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative @entity25			1
so far , two of the 59 senators in the @entity17 caucus -- @entity261 of @entity262 and @entity263 of @entity264 -- have said they will oppose the compromise package			0
@entity1 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0
