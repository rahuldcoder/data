-- never underestimate the power of the dark side			0
let 's go with never underestimate the power of a cute blond kid cloaked in the robes of mr. @entity8 himself , @entity9			1
despite having already been on television since 2009 , 6 - year - old @entity10 is winning more fans than he likely ever could have imagined after his appearance in a @entity15 advertisement for @entity16			1
" my dad said i 'm the hit star ! " @entity10 said tuesday during an appearance on @entity0 's " @entity20			1
" you 've doubtless seen the commercial by now			0
as many as 110 million @entity23 who watched the @entity15 on sunday saw it , and it 's been viewed more than 20 million times on @entity25			2
it depicts a young boy dressed in @entity9 's black robe and helmet feverishly trying to get something -- anything -- to obey " @entity10 " and bend to his will			1
he tries the washer and dryer			0
not even the family dog is moved			0
but when he tries to wield " @entity10 " on his dad 's new car , the engine roars to life -- with a little help from dad and his keyfob , of course			2
you can almost see @entity10 's eyes , wide - open with amazement , as he holds his arms out and turns to his unseen parents as if to say , " did you see that ? " " @entity55 , the director , said what he brought to the spot when they were filming was more of an authenticity because he was n't mimicking @entity9 , " @entity10 's mom , @entity54 said			1
" he was just challenging @entity9 and doing what he thought @entity9 looked like			2
" in fact , @entity63 fans might note @entity10 bears some resemblance to the actor who played young @entity9 , who later turned into @entity67			1
and fans are also comparing him a young @entity69 , who played @entity9 's son , @entity70			1
not that any of it means much to @entity72 still has n't seen any of the movies			2
" he 's a little scared , still , " his mother said			0

but he leads a normal life , his mother said			0
" once these kids get mended they can go and live full lives and that 's been a huge inspiration for others already , " she said			0
@entity10 spent most of his appearance on @entity0 tuesday fidgeting with a boxed set of all the @entity63 movies -- a gift from co-host @entity91			1
he did take a moment to turn to the camera , raise his eyebrows and wave			0
" hello ! " he said to the camera , as oblivious as any 6 - year - old to the grown ups talking around him .			1
