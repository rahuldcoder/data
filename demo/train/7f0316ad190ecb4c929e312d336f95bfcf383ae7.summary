-- the @entity3 oil drilling barge that ran aground off southern @entity4 this week is sound and ready to be towed to safe harbor , a company official said saturday , adding there is no evidence of any sheen in the vicinity			1
the 266 - foot - diameter @entity10 remains upright and there is no apparent threat to its stability , said @entity14 , the incident commander and operations manager for @entity16			1
the fuel tanks appear intact , and naval architects report the vessel is sound and fit to tow , he said			1
the @entity20 ran aground off uninhabited @entity21 , about 200 miles south of @entity22 , on monday night			1
the current tow plan calls for the barge to be towed 30 miles to the north to @entity26 for safe harbor and a more detailed assessment			0
" the exact timing of a potential towing activity will depend on weather , tides and operational readiness , " @entity14 told reporters in a news conference			0
as much as 150,000 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel and approximately 12,000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the @entity10 , which had been working in the @entity39 , off @entity4 's @entity40 , until october			1
the vessel was being towed back to its winter home in @entity43 when it ran into a severe storm off the @entity4 coast			1
the @entity46 evacuated the @entity10 's 18 - man crew dec. 29 , and it drifted for 10 hours the following day after the tug that was towing it lost power			2
monday night , tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24 - foot waves			1
that led to its grounding in an area where water depth is 32 to 48 feet			0
the @entity10 is a blue and white circular rig with a helicopter landing pad and a tower in the middle			2
the steel vessel is double - hulled and designed for drilling in @entity67 waters			0
most of the nearby shore is owned by a native @entity4 corporation on adjacent @entity71 , said @entity72 , of @entity4 's @entity73			1
state officials are working with residents to watch for any environmental impact caused by the grounding			0
@entity3 's @entity67 exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after @entity83 's @entity82 disaster in the @entity84			2
@entity3 says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the @entity83 well that erupted off @entity88 , killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap			2
the fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations @entity3 conducted off the @entity40 , on the opposite side of the vast state from where the @entity10 now rests			1
the @entity99 estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling			0
and the shrinking of the region 's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			0
climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels			0
the science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists			0
