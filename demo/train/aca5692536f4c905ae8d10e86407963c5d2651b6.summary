each year , 75,000 witnesses identify criminal suspects			1
yet , as the @entity3 has acknowledged in a recent landmark case , there is " a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness identifications			1
" in fact , given the risk of executing an innocent person , 16 states ban capital punishment			2
yet , in @entity14 , @entity13 faces execution on wednesday , even though seven out of nine witnesses have recanted their testimony against him			1
a study released monday by the @entity19 , analyzing 850 photographic lineups , found that mistakes in identification are often related to how the photos of a line - up are presented			1
it found if a person uninvolved in the case presents the photos one - by - one , rather than all at once , fewer mistakes are made			1
another critical factor is whether the authority presenting the photos knows who the suspect is			1
but it 's not only the method of presentation that is skewing justice			2
i had my own bout with mistaken eyewitness testimony			1
a few years ago , on a bright clear sunny afternoon , i was driving on an empty @entity44 country road when a man ran out in front of my car from a field to my left , carrying a @entity50 in his arms			2
the movement , and his incongruous burden , drew my attention			2
the man froze when he saw my car , and as i passed him our eyes met for a very long moment in the rear - view mirror			2
i will never forget the jolt of that confrontation			2
i did n't understand at the time what i was seeing , but the fear , and something wilder , that i saw in his eyes was palpable			1
after i passed , he dodged into the bushes on the other side of the road and disappeared			2
i went on to do the errands of the day , while puzzling about the meaning of what i had just seen			2
four hours later i decided to tell this experience to the police			0
it was then i found out there had been a robbery in that neighborhood , a @entity50 had been stolen and a suspect caught			1
but before he had been arrested , the suspect shot a police officer , who was in the hospital badly wounded			1
the police asked me to make an identification from a photographic lineup			0
here is what i did : three separate times , i pointed out a photograph of a man with a beard as the man i had seen on the road			0
as i learned from the subsequent unfolding of the case , the man i had seen on the road had no beard			0
in four hours , of course , he had n't had time to grow one			0
there was no way that the photograph to which i pointed could have been a picture of the man who was under arrest			0
i chose the photograph of another man because meeting the suspect 's eyes in the rear - view mirror had shocked me so much -- even though i had no conscious knowledge that he had a gun -- that i refused to recognize his face			1
it was probably because , subconsciously , i never wanted to see him again			0
this is what it can mean to be a witness to violence			1
you are not a rational spectator			0
it does n't matter if a photograph is set in front of you that depicts the real criminal and no one influences you improperly			0
you can still choose an innocent man			0
we can analyze all the numbers we want , but until we acknowledge more fully the role emotions play , we wo n't have the data required for the policies we need			1
other factors are also instrumental , according to the @entity3			0
findings can be influenced by whether the witness is under a lot of stress , whether the sighting is brief or a weapon is visible , if the witness is a different race from the suspect			1
the court recommended that juries be better instructed in how these and other factors can affect the ability to remember correctly			0
but the @entity19 study 's conclusion is stark : even if the photos are viewed one by one , culprits were correctly identified only 27 % of the time			1
according to @entity157 , 76 % of those who were exonerated based on dna evidence were convicted , at least in part , by eyewitness accounts			0
i am a historian of photography and a scholar of visual studies			1
i have made my living and my reputation by the sharpness with which i can see , remember and recount the details and meaning of photographs			1
by the time i was asked to make this identification from a set of photographs , i had been practicing this profession for over a quarter of a century			0
i was used to looking at all kinds of photographs , even mug shots , which are an area of interest for contemporary artists and cultural critics			0
and i got it wrong			0
until we understand what happens when people look at photographs they do n't want to see , we will not get the data that will drive better policy			0
we will continue to get wrongful identifications , wrongful convictions and worse , wrongful executions .			0

@entity193 : 7 out of 9 witnesses recanted testimony against @entity13
studies find witness testimony notoriously *unreliable* , she says , *including* in photo lineups
@entity193 , whose *specialty* is photos and memory , made incorrect @entity206 of suspect
@entity193 : fear and emotion play a large role in whether you recognize a suspect
