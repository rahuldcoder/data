-- @entity3 's newest family , the affluent @entity1 on " black - ish , " has been very well - received			1
the freshman comedy , about a successful @entity8 - @entity7 family man 's struggle with cultural identity , made its debut on the network wednesday night to impressive ratings			1
the pilot episode had an audience of 10.8 million and a rating of 3.3 in the key demographic of 18 - 49			2
by comparison , " black - ish 's " lead - in , the multiple @entity19 - winning " @entity18 , " started its sixth season wednesday with 10.9 million watching and a rating of 3.7			1
to put it another way : this is exactly how you want your pilot episode to launch			0
written by @entity29 and starring @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , " black - ish " centers on an @entity8 - @entity7 family living a comfortable life in the suburbs			1
@entity37 ( @entity30 ) is an advertising exec raising four kids with his doctor wife ( @entity31 )			1
he is also acutely aware of how far he 's come from his upbringing			2
" i guess for a kid from the ' hood , i 'm living the @entity7 dream , " @entity30 's @entity42 says in an opening voiceover			1
" the only problem is , whatever @entity7 had this dream probably was n't where i 'm from			0
and if he was , he should 've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money , stuff starts getting a little weird			0
" @entity42 admits that he sometimes feels like " a bit of an oddity " in his neighborhood , and throughout the pilot he worries that his four kids are growing up without a clear understanding of who they are			0
for example , his son @entity60 prefers to be called " @entity62 , " tries out for field hockey instead of his dad 's sport of choice , basketball , and is angling for a bar mitzvah for his birthday			2
and at work , @entity42 is faced with eye - rolling questions from colleagues on " how a black man would say good morning , " and the possibility that he was promoted to head the agency 's " urban " division because of his race			2
( @entity42 's internal response to the promotion : " wait			0
did they just put me in charge of black stuff ? " ) but while @entity42 's fretting could ( and does ) raise more serious conversations about race , class and identity , " black - ish " is still a comedy , and critics have praised it for knowing just how to leverage its complex subject for laughs			1
" even in a better season , @entity3 's provocative and very funny ' black - ish ' would stand out for its broad and biting satire of an uneasily post-racial society seen through a very modern - family prism , " said @entity94			1
" i 'm grateful that ' black - ish ' exists , first and foremost because it 's funny , " said @entity100 's @entity99			1
but , she continued , " ' black - ish ' has to be more than just another pretty good sitcom			1
as one of the few comedies on a major network with a predominantly @entity8 cast , it has to navigate the issue of race in @entity7			0
it ca n't just be funny , it has to be astute and adept as well			0
the good news is that so far , it navigates that challenging territory with intelligence , wit and subversive purpose			0
" @entity117 was n't as convinced , critiquing the series as " funny , but ... not revolutionary			0
" giving it a " b " grade , @entity117 's critic felt the comedy " skews too broad , " and some of that mixed reaction could be found on @entity124			2
responses ranged as widely as flat - out hating it and finding it racist to being pleasantly surprised			0
but of course , we 're only one episode in , as @entity134 's @entity133 pointed out in his review			0
" ' black - ish 's ' nuance is promising -- it 's aware that there 's not just one way to be black -- and the sheer level of execution suggests it has staying power , " he said			1
" for now , i can only say what i want to hear about any new half - hour : it happens to be funny			0

@entity3 *premiered* one of its new comedies , " black - ish , " on wednesday night
the series stars @entity30 and @entity31
it 's about a family trying to retain cultural identity
so far , critical reaction has been *largely* positive
