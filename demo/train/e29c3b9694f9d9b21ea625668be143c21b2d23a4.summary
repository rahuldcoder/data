-- the online coupon market has been exploding in the last year or so			0
just look at some of the startups offering this service : @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , zozi , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and many others			2
now , welcome a new member of the digital - coupon club : @entity15			2
the massive social network , which has 600 million members , announced on tuesday a pilot project that will let local businesses offer discounts through @entity15			1
but with so many group - discount sites already out there , is @entity15 's version offering anything unique ? here 's a breakdown of how the service works and how it differs , at least a little bit , from some of its competition			1
what are group discount sites ? @entity33 , the basics			0
group discounts are essentially digital coupons , sometimes with strings attached			2
at @entity5 , a certain number of people must purchase a deal before it 's " unlocked , " for example			2
some , such as @entity7 , are mobile deals based on a person 's location , and offer deals on nearby restaurants , spas or other services			2
others , such as @entity6 , are more generic			0
they 're basically coupons sent by e-mail			0
what is @entity15 ? @entity15 aims to make the idea of digital coupons more social			1
with so many millions of users , it 's hard to argue that @entity15 is n't in a good position to do this			1
users must purchase a coupon online before using it in real life			0
when they decide to buy , an item is automatically posted on their @entity15 news feed , alerting all of their @entity15 friends about the deal			2
where is @entity15 deals available ? for now , @entity15 is only being offered in five cities : @entity69 , @entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity72 ; @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76 , @entity75			1
@entity15 is testing the feature in these places first , and says it may expand to others at a later date			2
some of @entity15 's competitors in online coupons are available more widely			1
@entity5 works in dozens of @entity85 and @entity86 cities			2
@entity11 , however , which is another pilot project , is so far only available in @entity87 , @entity88			0
what 's the incentive to use @entity15 ? many of these online coupon sites use video game mechanics to try to entice people into purchasing stuff			1
@entity9 , a @entity97 and @entity98 pilot from the social network @entity99 , works somewhat like an airline frequent - flier program			1
the more a user participates , the more he or she " levels up , " giving him or her access to premium deals			0
@entity5 is similar in that it requires a bunch of people to buy a coupon before it 's activated			2
that encourages friends to spread the word about the deal , if they want to be able to use it			0
@entity15 does n't do any of that -- at least not yet			1
so why would anyone use @entity15 ? because they 're offering coupons			1
and because they 're on the world 's biggest social network			1
@entity15 says the goal of the deals is n't necessarily even that they 're deals -- it 's that people will be able to plan events on @entity15			1
" while many deals on @entity15 offer discounts , it 's more important to us that you find interesting experiences around you to do with friends , " @entity15 's @entity126 writes on @entity15 's blog			1
in other words , expect deals on group - centric activities , such as concerts or horseback riding			0
are @entity15 's discounts as good as @entity5 's ? does n't look like it			1
@entity5 claims to offer discounts of 50 % to 90 %			1
most of @entity15 's coupons for @entity69 range from 13 % to 75 % off , with more of them seeming to fall on the lower end of that scale			2
again , @entity15 says the social aspect of these coupons is almost more important than the discount itself			1
" if your primary reason for doing something is getting together with friends , i do n't know if a discount is necessary , " @entity126 told the @entity151			0
" we are not looking for the deep discount customer			0
" the integration with @entity15 is what the site sees as key : " a lot of deal sites get that deals are social , " @entity126 told the @entity165			1
" but i would n't say they are really well integrated with @entity15			2
" where can you see @entity15 ? in your news feed			0
on the @entity173 " sites of various businesses			0
or in your e-mail inbox , if you sign up for that			0
other sites , like @entity6 and @entity5 , also send out daily e-mails about the discounts they offer			1
how do you pay for @entity15 ? with a credit card , with @entity181 or with @entity182 , @entity15 's own currency that , for the first time , will be used to buy real - world goods			0
users buy deals in advance and then print out a coupon that 's used to redeem the deal			0
some other deal sites and apps let users buy discounts on - the - go			0
@entity7 , for example , which is available in 13 @entity85 cities , offers mobile coupons once a person is in the store or restaurant where they intend to use a deal			0
users just pull up the coupon on their smartphones , show the waiter or store clerk that they 've " unlocked " the deal ( for free ) and then get that discount applied to their bill -- without having to make any payment beforehand			0
paying up front -- the @entity15 and @entity5 model -- annoys some users			1
why is there so much competition in this space ? because there 's apparently lots of money to be made			0
ever since @entity223 , in december , reportedly offered to buy @entity5 for $ 6 billion , social coupons have been expanding like mad			1
as is often the case in tech , once start - ups in a new sector get hot , the big companies -- @entity223 and @entity15 in this case -- join the party late , hoping either to put out better products or capitalize on their huge user bases .			0

*facebook* on tuesday announces a @entity5 competitor called deals
the social network jumps into a space that is already *crowded*
@entity15 does n't appear to offer the deepest discounts
the site aims to make online coupons more social than other sites
