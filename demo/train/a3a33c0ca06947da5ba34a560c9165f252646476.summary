@entity5 , @entity6 the leaders of @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have signed up to a peace plan after lengthy talks , raising hopes that the brutal conflict in eastern @entity1 could be brought to a close			1
despite the hopes , some @entity14 leaders have voiced skepticism -- after all , a previous peace plan agreed to in september disintegrated amid continued fighting			0
so now the leaders have struck a new deal in @entity5 , @entity6 , what happens next ? between now and saturday night , we can expect to see continued fighting in eastern @entity1 between the @entity1 military and separatist forces			1
under the terms of the agreement , the ceasefire line for the @entity1 is the current front line and for the separatists it 's the front line as it was at the time of the previous deal on september 19			1
this represents a territorial gain for the separatists since september			0
the separatists may seek to make a push over the next 2½ days to try to win more territory			0
it 's not clear what will happen in the strategically important town of @entity42 , where rebel fighters currently have @entity1 forces almost surrounded after days of fierce fighting			1
an " immediate and comprehensive " ceasefire is due to come into effect from midnight saturday into sunday local time			1
the withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides should begin no later than the next day after the ceasefire ( monday ) , according to the agreement			1
it should take no longer than 14 days			0
the @entity1 forces must pull back their artillery of 100 millimeters or greater caliber by 25 kilometers ( 15½ miles ) from the current front line , while the separatists must withdraw their artillery the same distance behind the front line as of september 19			1
this should create a demilitarized zone at least 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) wide between the two sides			0
a wider division -- 70 or 140 kilometers -- is required for certain specified weapons with a longer range			2
the @entity68 is tasked with helping with and monitoring the withdrawal of the heavy weapons -- but it 's not clear how this will play out			1
if the withdrawal of heavy weapons is successful , then local elections should be held in separatist - held areas in the @entity75 and @entity76 regions			1
dialogue on this should start the day after the withdrawal			0
a change in the @entity1 constitution is expected to make this possible , along with reforms to give the region greater autonomy			2
if all this happens , then the @entity1 government may be able to take back control of its border with @entity2 in separatist - held areas by the end of the year			2
the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners should be completed no more than five days after the withdrawal of heavy weapons , the agreement states			1
speaking after the agreement was announced in @entity5 , @entity3 and @entity4 leaders made clear that it was not perfect but said it was better than taking no action			1
much of the finer detail remains to be worked out and this could prove to be where the agreement founders			0
@entity108 , head of the international affairs committee in @entity2 's lower house , the @entity110 , acknowledged this , tweeting : " @entity5 talks have reached their goal			2
now it 's all about following the agreement : tensions are very likely			0
the key is in implementation			0
' implementing a political deal will always be harder on the ground , where emotions run high			0
persuading fighters to surrender territory they have lost comrades to gain may not be easy			0
