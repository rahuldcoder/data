-- more than 6 million @entity1 signed up for @entity2 before the march 31 deadline to get private health insurance through the @entity2 exchanges			1
this is great news for the @entity8 administration			0
but there are millions more reasons to celebrate @entity2			1
actually , at the writing of this essay , there are more than 317 million reasons — because that 's the population of the @entity1 and every single one of us can benefit from health care reform			1
how ? here 's a rundown by the numbers : 3.1 million that 's how many young adults can get coverage because of the provision in @entity2 that allows them to stay on their parents ' insurance plans until age 26			1
105 million that 's how many @entity1 no longer have lifetime expense caps , whether it 's because they have chronic illnesses or because their insurance company set restrictive policies			1
6.1 million that 's how many @entity1 with @entity34 no longer have to go through the " doughnut hole " coverage gap			2
this means seniors can save more than $ 5.7 billion on prescription drugs			0
3.2 million that 's the number of small businesses estimated to be eligible for tax credits for providing health insurance to their 19.3 million employees nationwide , credits worth $ 15.4 billion in 2011 alone			0
4.4 million that 's how many low - income adults will now have access to health insurance thanks to states implementing the expansion of @entity52 under @entity2 ; an additional 5.8 million poor adults would be included in this count if 25 mostly @entity56 - led states were n't refusing @entity52 expansion			1
50 to 129 million that 's how many people will benefit from the @entity2 provision that eliminates all bars for coverage based on pre-existing conditions			1
studies say that anywhere from 19 % to 50 % of non-elderly @entity1 have health conditions that could qualify as pre-existing conditions			2
49.4 million that 's how many current @entity34 enrollees can feel secure knowing that , under @entity2 , existing @entity34 benefits can neither be reduced nor taken away			2
317 million -- that 's how many @entity1 — i.e. , all of us — potentially benefit from the requirement that insurance companies provide flu shots , @entity80 screenings , prostate exams , mammograms and @entity84 - approved contraception for free , without a co-pay			1
-- plus , we all benefit from new requirements that insurance companies must spend at least 80 % of our premium dollars on our health care as opposed to marketing or administration			0
-- we all benefit from the new requirement that insurance companies publicly justify their actions if they want to raise premiums by 10 % or more			0
-- we all benefit from knowing that our insurance can now never be capped or canceled at the whim of insurance companies			0
as high quality care is maintained while costs may go down because of improved coverage and access , we all benefit from a more affordable and effective health care system			0
what about , you ask , the estimated 4.7 million @entity1 who lost their current insurance plans during the rollout of @entity2 ? well , according to a congressional report , 2.35 million or so can take advantage of the @entity8 administration 's decision to grandfather those plans through 2014			1
another 1.4 million qualify for @entity52 expansion or subsidies in the @entity2 exchanges			2
on top of that , the @entity8 administration has agreed that a " hardship exemption " built into health care reform for any @entity1 facing major challenges in complying with the law would be interpreted to include those whose policies had been canceled			2
in other words , they wo n't be penalized			0
when republicans rolled out stories of alleged @entity2 victims , the details were usually debunked in some way			2
the truth is that many of the canceled plans were no longer legal under @entity2 because they neither covered the basic things insurance should cover or , worse , were dangerously designed to explode the minute the insured got sick : what @entity137 has called " junk insurance			2
" arguing that people should be able to keep these plans is like arguing that people should still be allowed to drive defective @entity142 or cars without seat belts			0
like it or not , the government 's job is to help keep us safe and insurance companies that were peddling shoddy products were doing the opposite			0
polls show most @entity1 want to keep @entity2 and work to fix it rather than replace or get rid of health care reform altogether			1
and there 's much to suggest support for @entity2 would be even higher were it not for constant @entity56 attacks and misinformation about the law			1
after all , when @entity1 find out what specific provisions are included in @entity2 , they overwhelmingly support them			1
eighty percent support the extension of dependent coverage , 79 % support closing the @entity34 " doughnut hole , " 77 % support eliminating out - of - pocket costs for preventive services , 74 % support the expansion of @entity52			0
these @entity2 components are even supported by a majority of @entity56			1
and it 's still early			0
as more @entity1 access private health insurance choices through the exchange marketplace , receive care minus the discrimination and dirty tricks that insurance companies could get away with in the past , we 'll see more people getting the medicine they need , screened for cancer sooner in more treatable stages and pay less for good care			0
every day , as we all see the benefits of health care reform in our lives , support for @entity2 will grow stronger			0
before long , not even the most partisan @entity56 will be able to attack it .			1

@entity190 : there are more than 317 million reasons to celebrate @entity2
@entity190 : with 6 million sign - ups , the young , poor , elderly and *chronically* ill all benefit
she says @entity1 want to keep @entity2 and fix it rather than get rid of it
@entity190 : over time , not even the most partisan @entity56 will be able to attack it
