" it is a step ( to ) nowhere for these regions			0
it is euphoria that may lead to very complex consequences , and many people can already feel them			0
" polls close amid allegations of fraud and double - voting @entity98 's announcement is reminiscent of separatists ' moves in the @entity102 peninsula of @entity103 , which @entity4 annexed after @entity104 voted to secede from @entity3 and join @entity4 in a march 16 referendum			1

@entity137 challenged @entity136 , asking him whether he thought that was enough to demonstrate " heft			0
" @entity136 responded that @entity122 is " considering further steps			2
" " those further steps might include an update of existing defense plans , development of new defense plans , enhanced exercises and also appropriate deployment , " he said			0
it 's too early , he said , to describe anything more specifically , " but we will not hesitate to take further steps if needed , " he said			0
