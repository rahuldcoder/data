@entity0 , @entity1 -- the downfall of @entity4 has left the golf world eager for an uplifting story , and arguably there are few better placed to provide this tale than 20 - year - old @entity9			1
the women 's game may struggle to compete with the men 's in terms of profile , but if there is any player who could help to bridge this gap it is the @entity19 student from @entity20			0
the expectation on @entity9 has always been great after she amazed the sport by qualifying for the @entity24 amateur championship aged just 10			1
she went onto become the youngest player ever to qualify for the @entity26 and became a millionaire 10 times over by signing sponsorship deals with both @entity29 and @entity30 after turning professional aged 16			1
the similarities with @entity4 were clear for all to see			0
her fame grew as she persisted to compete in men 's competitions while suffering inconsistent form at women 's events , but she had to wait until 2009 to capture her first @entity26 title			1
with her victory at the @entity39 and starring role in the @entity41 , @entity9 has once again captivated fans and gone some way to reassure doubters that she still has the potential to become a major force in women 's golf			2
with the 2010 @entity26 season due to tee off next month , @entity48 caught up with @entity9 to discuss her plans for the year ahead in work and play : " i love what i do			1
once my college work is done , i get to go out and focus on my golf			0
academically right now , i 'm a sophomore , but i 'm in my third year , so hopefully i 'll finish in five years or so , " she told @entity2			0
like many students her age , friends play an important role : " they bring me down to earth you know			0
they always make fun of me and they do n't know what i do , they do n't know what a par is			0
basically i tell them , if my scores look red , you can call me , if my scores look black , then i might not be in such a good mood so do n't talk to me ! " the @entity70 marked a turning point for @entity9 , proving she could hit shots beyond her female counterparts			1
@entity9 says it was an unforgettable experience : " it was such a great experience , i 've always heard that rumor that , the @entity77 team does n't bond as well as the @entity79 team , but i felt that we just bonded so well and had so much fun -- i really enjoyed every second of it			2
" despite this , there still remains a cloud of disapproval over the way in which @entity9 has conducted herself throughout her career			2
entering her first @entity93 event at the tender age of 14 , her attempts and failures to make it on the men 's tour have drawn criticism from players and fans			0
so does she regret these early decisions ? " no , i do n't think so			0
i think that every decision that i 've made in my life , at the time seemed like a great decision ... the mistakes that i 've made , i 've definitely learned from them			0
but you know , i enjoyed myself and i really had a lot of fun			0
" while the sun shone on @entity9 in 2009 , the @entity26 experienced a difficult year			1
like the men 's tour , financial crisis saw sponsors and media pull out -- and a seriously diminished schedule of events for 2010 led to the dismissal of @entity26 commissioner @entity119			2
despite the turmoil , @entity9 feels the tour will bounce back : " i just think that we have such a strong product , you know the players are amazing , we have different personalities , its so global , so international -- there 's so many ethnicities which gives us more opportunity to be in different countries that never really had golf before			1
" as she looks ahead to this year , @entity9 's resolve remains clear : to build on her new found confidence and success : " i want to show my fans and my country what i have			1

the 2009 @entity70 marked a turning point for @entity9
@entity9 is currently 10th in the @entity142
@entity9 says the @entity26 will bounce back from a difficult year
