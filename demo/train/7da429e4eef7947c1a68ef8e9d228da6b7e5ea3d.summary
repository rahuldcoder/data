@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity3 has become so fat on her diet of marshmallows that she 's been taken to @entity1 to lose weight			1
she 's " quite a character , " her new caretakers say , but settling her into her new home has proven tricky -- she 's an orangutan who has never seen another of her species before			2
@entity15 , the animal , arrived at the @entity17 in southern @entity1 last week , the center announced on @entity18			1
" we have a new arrival , very large & orange ! " the center said september 1 -- but kept details close to its chest			0
a day later , it said she was settling in well			0
" our new orange lady has spent the day in the nursery playroom today , she 's doing really well but we have a long way to go , she is obese ! that 's what a diet of marshmallows does , the center tweeted			1
weighing in at 100 kilograms ( 220 pounds ) , @entity36 is " the largest orangutan in @entity38 today , " the center said			2
she weighs about twice as much as she should , it added			0
she 'd been kept as a pet in @entity3 for 13 years , the center explained			1
her owner first contacted @entity17 for help in 2008			2
the center has been working to bring @entity15 to @entity1 since then , it said			1
" the care that she received in @entity3 was effectively misguided love , " monkey world director @entity45 told @entity2 on wednesday from the center in @entity47 , @entity1			1
she explained that @entity36 's previous owners had kept her as a pet , which she said is never a good idea with primates because they can become aggressive as they enter adulthood			0
" @entity36 's care became a problem because she was effectively left on her own for long periods of time during the day when the family were n't there to entertain her , and so they simply tried to keep her busy and happy by feeding her a lot of junk food -- so a lot of candy , a lot of sweets , and processed food , " @entity45 said			2
" because she was basically inactive and not flying around through trees and things , she put on an awful lot of weight , and now we have our work cut out for us here at @entity17 to get that weight off of her and to get her fit so that she , too , can become a breeding female and have a family of her own one day			1
" late last month , " the monkey world team went to @entity83 , with a specially designed transport box , several days prior to the move " so the orangutan could get used to being in the box			0
after two days of " playing " in the box , the door was shut for good and @entity15 was on her way to a more natural life in @entity1 , the center said			1
only on wednesday did the center finally post pictures of @entity36 , revealing her to have such an enormous belly it looks difficult for her to move			0
a second photo showed her in a cage being moved by forklift to her new home			0
the center is already itching to see progress , it admitted			0
" it 's very early days , " its most recent tweet on @entity36 says			0
" i so wish i had a magic wand ! " @entity45 said the orangutan would be put on a special diet and , with luck , would find a mate at the center			2
" now that she is at the park , we have her on a healthy diet of vegetables and fruits and she is getting a lot more exercise climbing through " a section of the park designed for baby orangutans			0
" it will take a few months for @entity15 to reach a more appropriate weight and then she will be ready to meet a new man and consider a family of her own , " she said			1
orangutans have the slowest metabolism of any of the great apes , even humans , @entity45 said , making it a challenge for @entity36 to lose the weight -- but as long as she is " getting all of the exercise and moving around as she should , the weight should start falling off naturally			1

@entity15 came from @entity3 to @entity1 to lose weight
she 's never seen another orangutan before , @entity17 says
" we have a long way to go , she is obese ! " the center tweets
