@entity0 -- @entity3 's top cleric has blamed the @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity7 's intelligence agency , for killing an @entity3 nuclear scientist , @entity3 's state broadcaster said			1
@entity9 , who died wednesday , was the third @entity3 nuclear scientist in two years to be killed by what @entity3 described as a magnetic bomb attached to his car			0
a fourth survived a similar assassination attempt			0
@entity9 's death shows that " the global arrogance spearheaded by the @entity21 and @entity22 has reached a deadlock in confrontation with the determined , devout and progressive nation of @entity3 , " @entity18 ayatollah @entity17 was quoted as saying by the state - run @entity26			1
those responsible will not own up , @entity17 said , but the attack " has been carried out by the planning or support of @entity5 and @entity6 [ spy ] services , like all other crimes of the network of international state terrorism			1
" @entity17 ended his message of condolence with a warning : " we shall persist in punishing the perpetrators of this crime , as well those supporting them behind the scenes			1
" @entity3 's president @entity49 sent his condolences friday to the families of @entity9 and his driver , who also died following the attack , the state - run @entity47 news agency reported			1
he pointed the finger at " agents of imperialism and international @entity22 , " a reference to @entity7			1
other @entity3 officials also blamed the killings on @entity7 and the @entity21 , both of which have accused @entity0 of pursuing a nuclear bomb -- a claim it denies			1
@entity21 secretary of state @entity64 " categorically " denied any role in the attacks , but urged @entity3 to halt its quest for a nuclear bomb			1
defense secretary @entity69 reiterated that message thursday , telling troops in @entity72 : " we were not involved in any way -- in any way -- with regards to the assassination that took place there			1
" i 'm not sure who was involved , we have some ideas as to who might be involved ... but i can tell you one thing : the @entity21 was not involved in that kind of effort , that 's not what the @entity21 does			1
gen. @entity89 , a spokesman for the @entity90 , said on his @entity92 page wednesday : " i have no idea who targeted the @entity3 scientist but i certainly do n't shed a tear			0
" @entity98 secretary - general ban ki - moon strongly condemned any terrorist action or assassination of anyone , " whether scientist or civilian			1
" " it is not acceptable , " he said via his spokesman @entity103			0
" human rights must be protected			0
" meanwhile , a newspaper aligned with @entity17 called thursday for the @entity107 to respond in kind to the killings of its nuclear scientists , suggesting @entity7 officials could be targeted			1
the editor of @entity0 daily @entity112 , considered the organ of @entity17 's supporters , questioned why @entity3 should not " exercise its legal right to retaliate			2
" @entity117 , @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity98 , said the assassinations of scientists were intended to deprive @entity3 of the right to peaceful nuclear energy			0
" we believe that these terrorist attacks are supported by some elements -- especially within the @entity7 regime as well as some quarters around the world , " he said			2
@entity3 says its nuclear program is aimed at producing civilian energy , not weapons			0
but it has rebuffed international demands to halt its enrichment of uranium , and the @entity134 says it has credible evidence that @entity3 has conducted weapons - related research			0
the @entity134 , which serves as the @entity98 nuclear watchdog , reported in november that it can no longer verify that the @entity3 nuclear program remains peaceful			0
the scientist 's death comes as western powers and @entity143 are tightening the screws on @entity0			0
@entity143 announced thursday it was prepared to gradually reduce oil imports from @entity3 , which supplies about 10 % of its crude supply , while @entity21 - led sanctions targeting @entity3 's central bank are driving down the value of the @entity3 currency and driving up consumer prices			2
at the same time , @entity21 observers say a covert campaign of sabotage appears to be under way against @entity3 's nuclear program			2
in addition to the deaths of nuclear researchers , @entity3 's @entity159 enrichment plant -- where @entity9 was the deputy director for commercial affairs -- has been hit with a computer worm that @entity166 analysts say has damaged about 10 % of the centrifuges used in the enrichment process			0
in the face of increased pressure , @entity3 has threatened to close off the @entity171 , the narrow waterway at the mouth of the oil - rich @entity173			0
it brought down and captured a @entity21 surveillance drone over its territory and claims to have arrested a dozen @entity21 spies , including an @entity3 - @entity21 former @entity178 who was sentenced to death this week			2
the @entity21 says he was wrongly accused .			2

president @entity49 offers his condolences to the *victims* ' families
" we shall persist in punishing the perpetrators of this crime , " @entity17 warns
@entity21 defense secretary @entity69 : " we were not involved in any way in the assassination "
