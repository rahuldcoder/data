@entity0 estimates he has told this story 100 times			1
he 'll never get tired of telling people about the forces that brought him to his soul mate at 51			0
the story begins in 1969 , when @entity0 walked down the aisle with @entity10 for the first time			1
they were the ring bearer and flower girl in the wedding of @entity0 's uncle , @entity16 , and @entity10 's oldest sister , @entity18			1
@entity19 was about to turn 6 , and @entity10 was 7			1
after the wedding , they remained childhood playmates , meeting up at family picnics and pool parties in the coal region of @entity26 where they lived			0
but by the time they were teenagers , their lives took different directions			0
@entity10 married young and had four children			1
@entity0 joined the @entity34 , married and had a son			1
things did n't work out how either of them planned			0
@entity0 's wife died of lung cancer after 30 years of marriage , and @entity10 's marriage ended in divorce			1
in early 2014 , they were both on their own again , living 50 miles apart in @entity45 , @entity26			0
" all she wanted in her life was for someone to love her , for her , " @entity0 said			2
" and the way i was left , all i wanted was to love somebody for one more day			0
" that 's when what they like to call the " divine conspiracy " began			0
@entity16 and @entity18 , now living in @entity56 , traveled back to @entity26 in may to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary			2
thinking of the couple , knowing they each could use a companion , @entity18 suggested @entity0 give @entity10 a call , just to talk			1

@entity0 called @entity10 a week later			1
you can probably guess what happened after that			0
" things just fit together -- there was no real working stuff out			0
the whole thing was very easy			0
the families knew each other , i knew her brothers , i knew her sisters , she knows my whole family and everything just worked out , " @entity0 said			2
@entity10 , who says @entity0 had appeared to her in a dream weeks before they reconnected , looks at the picture of him and her as ring bearer and flower girl and believes they had a spiritual connection even then			1
sometimes , they wonder why they did n't get married all those years ago , but they believe @entity90 truly did have a plan			0
from ring bearer and flower girl to husband and wife , 20 years later " if his wife would n't have passed away and i had n't got divorced , we probably would n't have met again , " said @entity10 , who just turned 53			1
" i think he was supposed to go through that experience , just like i was supposed to go through my experience to be a better person			0
" after dating for four months , they walked down the aisle for the second time on september 14 , 2014 , to become husband and wife			2
this time , the roles were reversed : @entity19 's uncle carried the rings and @entity10 's sister carried the flowers .			2
