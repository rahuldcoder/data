-- @entity1 had another love affair long before the one that cost him his job running the @entity6			1
it was with the press			2
the retired general 's skillful courtship of journalists brought him a career 's worth of favorable headlines and has , to a remarkable degree , softened the coverage of his fall from grace			1
@entity1 accomplished this in part by granting reporters access -- though none quite as extraordinary as that accorded his biographer , @entity23 , who several news organizations have identified as the other woman in the extramarital affair he has acknowledged			1
watch : are the media unfairly trashing @entity23 in @entity28 ? consider , for instance , the way @entity32 's @entity31 , who broke the story of @entity1 ' resignation on friday , described her scoop			1
" i do n't take any pleasure in this in the sense that this is really a personal tragedy , " @entity36 said on @entity37			0
" having covered @entity1 myself here and overseas , i am absolutely convinced from all the communications i have had from people directly involved that this was a matter of honor			1
" watch : why are the media obsessing on @entity46 and 2016 ? as @entity32 's longtime defense correspondent @entity47 told me on @entity0 's " @entity49 , " @entity1 would call him and other reporters regularly to chat off the record or on background			1
little surprise , then , that the tone of the coverage could be summed up as " huh ? " did @entity1 really have to quit over a garden - variety affair ? was this some sort of ploy to avoid testifying this week on the fatal attack at the @entity61 consulate in @entity62 ? turns out @entity64 investigators stumbled upon the affair while looking into @entity1 ' e-mail account			1
watch : @entity67 rejects reality on @entity69 his earlier relationships with journalists yielded benefits for both sides			0
during the @entity76 invasion in 2003 , @entity1 , then commanding the @entity74 , allowed @entity78 reporter @entity77 to shadow him , including on a @entity80 helicopter			1
here is just one passage from what @entity77 , a stellar military reporter , later turned into a book : @entity85 : @entity1 ' resignation does n't preclude testimony " we stood 15 feet beyond the tent flap			1
i blinked at the swirling dust , and felt grit between my molars			0
when @entity1 turned to face me , i was alarmed to see how troubled his blue eyes were			1
" this thing is turning [ bad ] , " he said			0
" the 3 @entity100 " -- the @entity101 , fighting just ahead of the 101st around @entity102 -- " is in danger of running out of food and water			0
they lost two @entity104 and a @entity105 last night , although they got the crews out			0
the corps commander sounds tired			0
" @entity1 famously turned to @entity77 and said : " tell me how this ends			2
" watch : why @entity109 and @entity111 photo went viral now that kind of access is n't just smoke and mirrors ; @entity1 ran the risk that the mission might have been a disaster			2
but he trusted journalists , took them into his confidence , and in return was portrayed as a swashbuckling general , military intellectual and , eventually , potential presidential candidate			2
@entity123 even ran a feature on @entity1 ' " @entity125			2
" ( the author ? @entity23			0
) this is not to say the plaudits were n't deserved			0
@entity1 literally wrote the manual on counterinsurgency , made important gains while leading @entity133 's surge in @entity76 , and adjusted strategy when president @entity135 asked him to oversee the war in @entity137			1
but since @entity135 sent @entity1 to @entity6 last year , he has kept an unusually low profile			2
as questions swirled about the @entity6 's role in the @entity62 tragedy , he said nothing publicly			1
a @entity6 director without the deep media relationships that @entity1 enjoyed would have faced a torrent of stories about why he was missing in action and whether he had bungled the job of diplomatic security			1
instead , the press gave petraeus a pass			2
what 's your reaction to @entity1 ' resignation ? sound off with @entity156 maybe that 's true on his career - ending episode as well			1
but that has hardly been the case with @entity23 , whose e-mails triggered an @entity64 investigation			0
( in hindsight , it might not have been the height of discretion to do a television tour about your book " @entity171 , " talking about how awesome your subject is			0
) author @entity172 , who portrayed @entity1 favorably in his @entity76 war book " @entity174 , " writes on @entity176 's website : " @entity1 took the samurai route and insisted that he had done a dishonorable thing and now had to try to balance it by doing the honorable thing and stepping down as @entity6 director			1
but why ? @entity1 is retired from the military			2
if the affair happened back when he was on active duty , it is part of the past			0
and there is nothing illegal about civilians having affairs			0
" maybe that 's the right tone			0
but contrast it with the way that politicians and business executives routinely get pummeled for fooling around -- though it 's different , and should be , if subordinates are involved ( or an intern , in @entity200 's case , or a housekeeper , as in @entity202 's )			0
news flash : even top officials are human			0
and they get a lot more sympathy in times of trouble from journalists they have befriended			0
@entity85 : @entity1 story ' does n't add up ' @entity215 majority leader knew of @entity1 affair in october @entity1 letter : ' i showed extremely poor judgment ' opinion : how @entity1 changed the @entity61 military the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 : @entity1 long had a good relationship with the media
he says the general 's courtship of journalists brought him favorable headlines
@entity224 : in coverage of *scandal* that led to resignation , media have given him benefit of doubt
he says the press has given @entity1 a pass on question about security in @entity62
