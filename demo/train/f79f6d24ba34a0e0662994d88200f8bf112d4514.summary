@entity0 , @entity1 -- fearing for people 's safety , @entity1 opposition leaders canceled a demonstration planned for the anniversary of last year 's disputed presidential election , according to a statement posted on @entity10 thursday			1
the protests were to have taken place saturday			1
@entity1 went to the polls a year ago on that day , and when word of fraud surfaced , so did public outrage			1
widespread unrest gripped the @entity19 republic as protesters clashed with police			0
but the hard - line government 's crackdown on the opposition -- known as the @entity25 and led by former presidential candidates @entity27 and @entity28 -- has been , at times , brutal			2
and the government has steadily been tightening its grip throughout the year , said a report issued thursday by @entity33 , which has been monitoring the situation through interviews with people in @entity1			2
the government and police had issued warnings to @entity1 not to participate in any gatherings saturday			1
a joint statement posted on @entity27 's @entity10 page said that it was obvious to the opposition that if " innocent and defenseless " people took to the streets saturday , they would once again be met with violence			1
@entity25 supporters have always said they seek democratic reforms and civil rights , not violence			0
" by considering the report of the representatives of reformist parties and also for the safety of the people , we are announcing that the planned demonstration will not be held , " the statement said			2
" we ask the people and the protesters to demand and follow up on their rightful demands and requests through less costly and more effective methods			0
" @entity1 's anti-government demonstrations started out strong but have limped along in recent months as security forces have sought to silence the voices of dissent			1
@entity33 said the current atmosphere inside the country is markedly different than the images of defiance that filled the internet and television screens starting a year ago			0
" while the international community has focused on @entity1 's nuclear ambitions , @entity0 has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country , " said @entity73 , deputy @entity74 director at @entity33			1
" journalists , lawyers , and civil society activists who used to speak to foreign media and human rights groups are increasingly reluctant , fearing phone and internet surveillance , " he said in a statement released with the latest report			0
the rights group says that @entity1 's crackdown extends beyond election protesters			1
the 19 - page report lists abuses including arbitrary arrests , extra-judicial killings , rapes , torture and violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression			0
scores of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted , the report says , and the government has executed at least seven @entity108 political dissidents , while more than a dozen still sit on death row			0
@entity1 has defended its record before the @entity113 @entity112			2
@entity114 , the secretary general of @entity1 's @entity115 , has said that the government only goes after those who incite violence			1
" nobody is jailed because of the protest , " @entity114 told @entity2 in february			0
" the only reason for jailing is the violence which was attached with the protests			2
any government has a duty to bring an end to the violence			0
i think the beating of our police is much more less than the @entity131 and @entity132 police			0
" @entity27 and @entity28 had called weeks ago for demonstrations on june 12 , to mark the controversial election that returned hard - liner @entity135 to the presidency			0
on thursday , they rebutted claims that the opposition movement had been greatly diminished			1
" the policy makers , more than anyone , realize this fact that the movement is alive and the true honor of it belongs to those who , despite all the threats and dangers , the insecurities and also knowing the potential life - threatening and financial consequences , still have not given up on their rightful protest , " they said			0
despite the call to cancel saturday 's demonstration , some @entity1 told @entity2 they would go out on the streets if they see protests taking shape , making the scope of the protests , if any , difficult to predict .			1
