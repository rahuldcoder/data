-- scientists say they 've found a galaxy that 's not just far , far , away -- it 's the most distant from our own that 's been discovered yet			1
and it 's helping them gain insight about the universe as it existed a long time ago			2
astronomers say the galaxy , called @entity11 , is the most remote one they can confirm with spectroscopy , a technique that looks for the chemical signatures of elements			2
in this case , that element was hydrogen , the main fuel of stars			0
researchers reported their findings in the journal @entity24			0
@entity11 -- no , that 's not a typo , or a spam username -- is a window into the past			0
because of its distance , it shows what things would have been like 700 million years after the @entity32			1
the universe is 13.8 billion years old , so 700 million years after the start is actually quite early by comparison			1
star formation besides breaking the distance record , astronomers find the new galaxy exciting because it appears to produce stars at an unusually high rate , said lead study author @entity42 , assistant professor of astronomy at the @entity44			1
star - formation rate is measured by how much raw hydrogen the galaxy converts into new stars every year			1
the @entity11 galaxy converts hydrogen in the amount of 300 times the mass of our sun into new stars each year			1
by contrast , the @entity55 only produces stars at one or two solar masses per year			1
scientists established through previous research that in the first billion years of the universe 's history , typical rate of star formation went up , @entity42 said			1
galaxies formed more and more stars over time until about 10 billion years ago , when star formation rates began to decrease			2
the newly - confirmed galaxy is still unusual in its high star - formation rate , given how far away it is			1
but one of the previous record holders for " most distant galaxy " was making stars at 100 solar masses per year , which is in the same ballpark , meaning @entity11 is not a total fluke in its prolific star - making			1
" now it 's much less likely that we just stumbled upon a very rare phenomenon , and much more likely that the early universe harbors these sites of intense star formation , many more than we had previously thought possible , " @entity42 said			2
shifting to red all of the visible and ultraviolet light from the @entity11 galaxy has been shifted into the infrared spectrum by the time it reaches @entity90			1
that 's because the universe itself is expanding , and the stretching of space - time makes light waves stretch as well			1
this phenomenon , called " red shift , " is similar to the doppler effect of sound -- for instance , the pitch of a police - car siren sounds higher when it 's getting closer to you and lower as it moves away because the car is moving			2
the movement causes changes in the wavelength and frequency of sound waves that the observer receives			0
astronomers can calculate the distance of a star , galaxy or other celestial object by examining how much light from it has been shifted into the infrared			2
this requires sophisticated techniques to make the calculations			0
in the nature study , researchers used the @entity125 infrared camera at the @entity126 in @entity127 to study 43 galaxy candidates that had been found in a @entity130 exploration of the sky : the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
astronomers were looking for a special radiation signature from hydrogen called the @entity136			0
this radiation represents the particular wavelength of light that gets emitted when hydrogen atoms get excited in a particular way			0
researchers were able to detect this emission line coming from @entity11 , but not from any of the other 42 candidates			0
what about those other candidates ? @entity42 theorizes that there is just a lot of gas that absorbs the hydrogen emissions , which is why we ca n't detect them on @entity90			0
that may mean that " galaxies at early epochs accrete gas at high rates , and that the resulting large amounts of gas extinguish most of the @entity161 in these young galaxies , " @entity152 , astronomer at @entity153 , wrote in an accompanying nature " @entity165 " article			0
" we need much deeper observation to try to see this @entity136 , " @entity42 said			0
more most - distant galaxies to come ? @entity42 and colleagues found this most distant galaxy on the first of two nights of observation , during a period of about six hours			1
they have applied for more nights at @entity126 for follow - up , so @entity11 may soon have competition for the distance record			0
let 's hope these far , far away galaxies do n't have @entity182 - ish civil wars			2
follow @entity183 on @entity184 at @ lizlandau			0

most distant galaxy came 700 million years after the @entity32
it produces stars at a rate more than 100 times faster than the @entity55
the galaxy 's light is red - shifted because the universe is expanding
