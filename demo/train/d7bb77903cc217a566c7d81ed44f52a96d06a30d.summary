@entity0 has entered the race to become @entity4 president determined to change an organization he describes as all too often associated with " scandal			1
" the former @entity8 and @entity9 star revealed his intention to run against @entity11 in an exclusive interview with @entity1 wednesday			1
the 42 - year - old is renowned the world over after a distinguished 20 - year playing career and arguably counts as the most credible threat yet to @entity11 's 17 - year stranglehold on soccer 's top job			1
@entity0 was twice voted world player of the year and represented @entity21 127 times , featuring at the @entity23 in 2002 and 2006 , as well as playing in three @entity24			1
" i care about football , so what i 'm seeing regarding the image of @entity4 -- not only now but in the past years -- i do n't like it , " he told @entity28 in @entity8			1
" if you search @entity4 on the internet you see the first word that comes out : scandal -- not positive words			0
it 's that we have to change first and try to improve the image of @entity4			2
football deserves much better than this			1
" i 've been talking with so many important people in football -- players , managers , president of federations -- and they all think that something has to be done			0
" last year was the @entity23 , i was in @entity44 and i saw the reaction of all the fans regarding the image of @entity4 and i think something has to be changed			2
" change in leadership , governance , transparency and solidarity , so i think it 's the moment for that			0
" @entity0 joins former @entity56 star @entity55 , independent candidate @entity57 , @entity59 vice-president prince @entity58 and @entity60 , the head of @entity62 football , in the running to become president			1
the deadline for nominations is thursday and @entity0 confirmed to @entity1 he has secured backing from the five @entity4 member associations required to get his name onto the ballot paper for may 's election , though he did not name them			1
his work for @entity73 and the @entity75 national team also means he satisfies @entity4 's rule that states all candidates must have played an active role in association football for two of the five years			1
he has also been working on @entity82 's @entity81			0
@entity0 said the furore over a key report that looked at the bidding process for the 2018 @entity23 , awarded to @entity86 , and the 2022 installment , given to @entity88 , had convinced him to stand against @entity11			1
soccer 's governing body enlisted @entity92 lawyer @entity91 to probe claims that former @entity4 member @entity94 used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid , charges he and @entity88 have strenuously denied			1
@entity91 quit his role as chairman of the @entity100 of the @entity101 after the organization decided not to publish his report , instead releasing a summary by @entity106 judge @entity105 -- its independent ethics adjudicator			2
" after that report was not published i think that was the moment of change and the moment i thought that something had to be done , " @entity0 explained			2
" if you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation , a report , which you have nothing to hide , why do n't you make public that report ? if you have nothing to hide about that , you have to do it			0
" [ publishing the report ] is the easy thing to do if all the people is doubting what happened			0
if it came from @entity4 to order that report and after that you do n't publish , it is not a good decision			2
" @entity0 might have the name and the credentials but toppling @entity11 could prove his toughest challenge yet			1
@entity4 's president had repeatedly said his current term would be his last but had a rethink at the @entity4 congress in june last year -- despite the increasingly turbulent nature of his tenure			1
the 78 - year - old 's u-turn drew criticism from a number of federations but his power within the organization was underlined recently when the @entity59 confirmed its intention to support him even after its own vice-president , prince @entity58 , declared his candidacy			1
but @entity0 maintains he is unfazed by the scale of his task : " i think no one is untouchable in this life , " he said			0
" if you think like that you are wrong			0
" of course [ @entity11 ] is a person that is running the organization for so long , since 1998 , and a lot of people can be the favorite but i can say for me it is a fantastic challenge to try and convince the people to follow me and support me			2
" i have so many examples in football ; you can play against the strongest team or you can play against the weakest team and you never know who will win			0
" sometimes you think you will lose and you win , sometimes you think you will win and you lose			0
that is the beauty of sport			0
that is the beauty of this running too			0
it is not easy but you have to believe			0
" @entity0 's bid drew immediate support from @entity178 manager and fellow @entity75 @entity179 , who said : " @entity0 's candidacy is a great step forward for football			2
" his career over many years grants a better future for @entity4			0
he will be a president focused on football and its general improvement , acting closely with all federations			0
