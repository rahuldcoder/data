friday marks the anniversary of the assassination of @entity2 in @entity3 by @entity5 forces			1
three years on , the core organization of @entity7 has been significantly depleted			0
however , the danger from so - called " home - grown " terrorism may yet be on the rise , fuelled by foreign nationals returning from key international theatres of war such as @entity15			1
in the @entity19 , for instance , @entity16 , director of the @entity17 , recently asserted that the threat from @entity19 nationals travelling to participate in the @entity23 conflict is the " biggest challenge " to @entity19 security services since 9/11			0
the total number of @entity19 nationals who have fought in @entity15 is estimated at up to 366 by the @entity27 for the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) at @entity30 , with a significant number believed to have been killed there			0
moreover , @entity29 estimates that as many as 11,000 foreign fighters overall may have fought in @entity15 , from more than 70 countries , a number which is reported to be a higher concentration than anywhere since @entity38 in the 1980s			1
a central concern here is that many of these individuals , which include potentially as many as 2,000 from @entity44 , plus individuals from @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 , will return from @entity15 to their respective homelands battle hardened with significantly greater terrorist capability and resolve			2
and given that the relatively large number of these foreign fighters makes them collectively difficult to track with precision , further home - grown attacks appear increasingly likely			1
while this offers propaganda value for @entity7 , such individuals often lack thorough indoctrination of the network 's core messages , even though some , including last year 's @entity65 and @entity66 terrorists , appear to have been partially motivated or inspired by them			0
this reflects , in part , the continued diminution of @entity7 's central organization which is unlikely to be able to provide operational support for home - grown terrorists			1
it also means that these people , while highly dangerous , do not individually represent the same level of threat to international interests as larger cells and terrorist groups , and are thus less likely to be able to perform major , spectacular attacks in the mould of 9/11			0
thus , while @entity2 's successor , @entity84 , has sought to seize on home - grown @entity44 terrorism , and indeed the chaos in @entity15 , for propaganda purposes , this can not disguise the central @entity7 organization 's declining fortunes			1
@entity84 lacks @entity2 's personal authority within the terrorist network , and the core has also been weakened by the assassination of numerous other senior terrorist leaders			0
a fundamental challenge for @entity84 is that while the central @entity7 leadership appears to remain located largely in @entity3 tribal areas and borderlands , the wider network has becoming increasingly de-centralized and dispersed			2
the problems this can cause were underlined earlier this month in @entity15 when a jihadist group called @entity104 and @entity15 ( @entity104 ) accused @entity7 of having " deviated from the correct path , " and " divided the mujahedeen in every place			2
" the origin of the dispute probably lies in an edict from @entity84 to @entity104 to confine its activities to @entity112 after it was accused of abuses of civilians and rival rebels in @entity15			0
@entity84 has instead recognized the @entity116 as the official @entity7 affiliate in @entity15 and called for jihadist unity behind it			0
accompanying this dispersal and de-centralization has been shifting the focus of @entity7 groups and franchises whose attention is more on " local " national or regional issues , rather than the broader international designs of @entity2			1
in part , this also reflects the greater difficulty of attacking key international targets many of whose defences have significantly hardened since 9/11			0
there has also been evolution in the geographical focal points of @entity7 activity with terrorist nodes of growing importance , for instance , in key @entity144 and @entity143 countries , such as @entity145 , where political upheaval since @entity2 's death has allowed terrorists and other insurgents to secure greater foothold			1
and reflecting this changed risk pattern , @entity5 forces are re-deploying as a result			2
for instance , the @entity154 has expanded its staff in @entity145 , and also enhanced its air bases in the @entity158 from which it can launch drone strikes into the country			0
only last week , @entity161 launched a major drone attack which , according to the @entity145 government , killed at least two dozen militants , including foreign fighters , in an @entity7 training camp in the remote mountainous area of @entity168			1
meanwhile in @entity49 , @entity5 forces have also scaled up facilities in numerous states , including @entity171 , @entity172 , and the @entity173			2
this is intended to allow for greater aerial surveillance coverage and drone strikes , especially in @entity49 , plus sites for military hardware storage			0
so while the central core of @entity7 has been diminished since @entity2 's demise , much of the wider terrorist network remains potent , albeit more focused on local grievances than grander international ambitions			2
however , danger may be growing from home - grown threats fueled by battle - hardened individuals returning from foreign theaters of war , especially @entity15 , with greater terrorist resolve and capabilities .			1
