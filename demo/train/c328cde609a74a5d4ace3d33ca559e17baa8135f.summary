-- @entity1 is deploying to @entity2 to tag key infrastructure buildings with red , yellow and green markers -- designations on whether they 're still usable			1
@entity7 has years of experience as a civil engineering expert dealing with structures in the wake of earthquakes			1
this disaster is also personal : he was born in @entity2 and one of his uncles died in the quake 's aftermath			1
the associate chair of @entity21 's @entity20 , @entity7 will lead a team of experts in @entity2 about the sustainability of buildings			1
he spoke with @entity0 before heading to @entity26			2
below is a transcript of the interview , a portion of which has been edited			2
@entity0 : what will be your task in @entity2 ? @entity7 : there 's an urgent need for a group of experts in earthquake engineering , preferably @entity41 speaking , to come down and assess the critical buildings to determine whether or not they 're safe to reoccupy			1
essentially , we go about tagging them : red for unsafe ; green for safe ; yellow for something in between			1
we were asked to do this on a number of critical infrastructure buildings , including hospitals , schools , @entity55 facilities , government buildings , as well as buildings occupied by various nations ' ambassadors			1
evidently , there has n't been anybody on the ground yet to do that service , so there 's a need to get somebody in there asap to assess as many buildings as possible			1
... there 's a specific manual that 's been developed by the @entity71 and the manual is geared toward the rapid assessment of buildings after earthquakes			1
the manual gives you guidelines based on the type of damage -- the type of cracking you have in columns and other load - bearing elements , as well as how many of them have specific levels of damage			2
based on this checklist , you can then determine what category your building should be classified as			2
@entity0 : in many ways , this is the nightmare scenario			0
you have this quake in impoverished @entity2			1
supplies are hard to get down there			0
in a month or two , you have the start of a rain season and following that you enter hurricane season			0
@entity7 : there are a number of issues there			1
they clearly do n't have the infrastructure to facilitate rapid recovery from this			0
there are a number of buildings that have collapsed and bodies are still there			2
it will take weeks , if not months , to recover those bodies			0
and like you said , the rain season is coming up			0
... it 's really the worst of all cases			1
this is probably the one country that could not handle an event like this			0
i call this in some ways the perfect storm of an earthquake , given that it was large , it was very shallow , the infrastructure is extremely poor and the government was n't prepared			0
so i think the resulting disaster is really a combination of a number of factors working against it			0
@entity0 : describe your own personal feelings as you head down there , as @entity2 and as somebody who lost a loved one			1
@entity7 : i had one uncle that passed away			1
his was what we typically call " secondary effect			0
" he was found safe following the earthquake			2
he had been somewhat ill with prostate cancer and he had [ gone ] back several times to the @entity148 for treatment			0
... my father spoke to him shortly after the event and he was doing fine on wednesday			0
then , it sounds like he was n't feeling very well			0
on friday , i believe , he went to the hospital and clearly with all the other critical patients , they could n't really deal with him			0
and he died on saturday			2
a lot of these things are never captured during an event like an earthquake or hurricane			0
we call them " secondary effect , " where a hospital is overrun and those that are ill -- maybe not directly from the earthquake -- end up dying whereas normally they probably would not			0
@entity0 : when you first talked to him , you must have been relieved that he was alive and you must have been celebrating			0
another close relative , my godmother and godfather : we 've been told through their children in the @entity148 that they are safe but their home has been destroyed			2
@entity0 : what 's going through your mind as you return home ? @entity7 : i was born in @entity2			1
i came [ to the @entity148 ] as a very young child			0
i spent the majority of my life in the @entity148 ... but we still have a lot of family and ties to @entity2			1
for many years , as my capacity as a civil engineering professor , i 've always wanted to do whatever i can to help @entity2			1
and i see this as one opportunity to do that , given that i do earthquake engineering			2
i want to use this opportunity , not only to help them recover in the short term , but also rebuild @entity2 so that it 's safe and sustainable			1
and i think this earthquake , unfortunately , provides the opportunity to start from scratch and make it a much better , more resilient place .			0
