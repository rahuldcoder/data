as adults we 're told time and again to keep a close eye on young children around water			1
most kids who drown are under the age of 4 -- toddlers who accidentally fall into water too deep			1
they can drown in minutes in less than 2 inches of water			1
but the recent death of a 13 - year - old at a pool in @entity13 has experts concerned about water safety for pre-teens and adolescents			1
@entity18 had been playing in a pool at @entity21 's @entity20 on sunday			0
relatives told @entity24 affiliate @entity23 that @entity18 was jumping in and out with friends when they noticed him missing , and pulled him out of the water within minutes			1
the boy died tuesday morning , according to the @entity28			0
police are still investigating his death			1
ten people die every day from unintentional drowning in the @entity33 , making it the fifth - leading cause of unintentional injury death , according to the @entity37			1
about 20 % are under the age of 14			1
nearly 80 % are male			1
" the first thing to remember is that drowning does n't just happen , " says @entity39 , water safety expert and president of @entity42			1
" something always precipitates drowning			1
" only about 35 % of @entity33 know how to swim , and only 2 % to 7 % swim well , @entity39 says			1
teens are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and often go past their limits			0
exhaustion or disorientation under water could cause a weak swimmer to panic			1
in this case , the swimmer would go through the stages of what lifeguards call an " active drowning , " @entity39 says			2
the word " active " may be misleading , as active drowning is nothing like what you usually see on tv			2
15 things your lifeguard wo n't tell you in an active drowning , a swimmer is at or below eye level at the surface of the water for about 10 to 20 seconds			1
the head is tilted back to get air			0
the eyes are either wide open or tightly shut			0
the mouth is often in an " o " shape from shock			0
" you 're not drowning if you can call for help , " @entity39 says			2
after about 20 seconds , the swimmer will start to sink and will hold his breath underwater for anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds			0
if rescued during this time , the swimmer usually will be fine			0
after 90 seconds , @entity39 says , a swimmer will black out			0
at this point , things get dicey			0
if a swimmer is resuscitated after the four - minute mark , there 's a high risk of brain damage			0
the pool safety hazard you do n't know about drowning also can be caused by trauma or a medical condition , @entity39 says			1
diving into shallow water could result in paralysis from a spinal injury			1
experts also look for unknown heart issues in sudden drowning cases			1
people with epilepsy or seizure disorders are also at high - risk			2
@entity39 says one of the most subtle forms of drowning is called " shallow water blackout			1
" typically , a person holding his breath will be triggered to breathe when his co2 levels get high			0
but if a swimmer is holding his breath for a long time while exhaling underwater , or is going underwater repeatedly , his co2 levels are lowered			0
when that happens , the brain 's built - in alarm to breathe does n't go off , despite a lack of oxygen			0
" you ca n't tell when they go unconscious , until it 's too late , " @entity39 says			0
@entity39 has videos of teens drowning that were recorded on their friends ' phones			2
the most common phrase she hears from witnesses is : " i thought they were just fooling around			0
" how safe is your indoor swimming pool ? @entity135 , aquatics manager for the @entity136 , says people of all ages need to understand the risks associated with water			1
" people need to know how to swim well , they need to know how to behave safely , and make good choices for where they swim			1
" more than half of drowning deaths in people older than 15 occur outside of pools , according to the @entity37			1
and alcohol is involved in 70 % of cases			2
parents should set expectations for teens around water ahead of time , @entity150 says			2
no one should be allowed to swim alone , even if they are a strong swimmer			2
following the rules of a pool is also key : no running , no horseplay , no diving into shallow water			1
and the @entity136 recommends against any type of breath - holding competition			0
teens should know their own limits , @entity150 says , and not follow stronger swimmers without help			0
" we talk about the dangerous @entity173 -- too far , too long , " she says			0
if teens are swimming in a natural body of water like a lake or river , they should use the rule " feet first , first time " to prevent spinal injuries			2
and when the sun stops shining , swimmers should stop swimming			0
@entity150 's final rule is the most important : learn how to swim			2
the @entity136 and many local swim organizations offer lessons for children as young as 6 months old and their parents			2
how can i keep my toddler safe in the pool ? people should feel confident in whatever water environment they 're in , @entity150 says , whether it 's a wave pool at a water park or a river with a strong current			1
no one should swim alone and , if possible , always swim under the watchful eye of a certified lifeguard			0
last but not least , if you do get yourself or a friend in trouble , know how to get help			0
learn cpr and get training on an automated external defibrillator , or @entity210			0
be aware of reach poles or buoys that can be thrown to help a drowning swimmer , @entity150 says , and call 911 at the first sign of an emergency .			0
