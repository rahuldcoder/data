@entity0 -- @entity3 sits in the shade of his own shadow , a large mural painted in his likeness on the wall outside @entity8 in @entity0 @entity3 's still got a sharp mind and a sharper sense of humor , but he 's starting to show his age : it 's hot outside , and despite the sticky august weather , @entity3 is wearing white socks with his brown leather sandals			1
the 76 - year - old comedy legend has been visiting the @entity0 eating establishment since 1958 and is perhaps its most famous patron -- so when the restaurant decided to celebrate its 50th anniversary , it was fitting that @entity3 hosted the festivities			1
today the restaurant turns 55 , so it 's no surprise he 's back			1
before @entity3 takes the stage , though , local politicos step into the spotlight and celebrate in the way politicos do -- promising resolutions and issuing declarations and proclamations			2
a highlight was a letter read aloud from president and mrs. @entity36 , who promise to return for a spicy meal soon			1
but before @entity8 received the keys to the city , before the president took his first bite of a chili dog , and before @entity3 put @entity43 and his family on the map , @entity8 was a humble food joint founded by an immigrant from @entity48 and his young wife			1
trading mops for menus @entity52 had moved to @entity53 for college and according to his wife , @entity56 , had worked his way through school climbing the restaurant ladder -- eventually trading mops for menus as he transitioned from cleaner to maitre d '			1
after several years in the business , he decided to try his hand at owning a restaurant instead of just working in one			1
he and his wife settled on the @entity68 location , taking over an old pool hall and transforming it into what it is today -- the landmark @entity8			2
" if you were going to open a restaurant in @entity0 and you were @entity81 in those days , there was one place to really go , and that was this very vibrant community right here , " on @entity68 , says 79 - year - old @entity56 , sitting in the back room of the restaurant beneath a painting of her late husband			1
in the late 50s and 60s , @entity68 was fondly known as " @entity68 " due to the jazz clubs , theatres and @entity81 owned business found on the street			2
@entity88 and @entity89 according to the restaurant 's website , " it was not uncommon to see such luminaries as @entity89 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , [ or ] @entity88 " at the restaurant			1
" we 've always treated all people the same so it does n't matter if you are the president or @entity88 or if you are just the guy from the corner , " says @entity56			1
" we like the diversity that we have here			2
we just kind of try to provide a family atmosphere because we believe so much in family			0
" @entity3 , too , frequented during his time in the @entity109 and even brought his now - wife @entity110 on dates			0
according to @entity56 , @entity3 was always a gentleman and was always funny			0
" he was n't famous , but he was always funny			0
he was just great fun to be around , " says @entity56			0
" he 's been coming since ' 59 and he 's been the most ardent and faithful supporter all these years			1
as he grew , he kind of took the chili bowl along with him			0
" according to @entity56 , when @entity3 's show was rated no. 1 for five years , @entity114 asked him to do a press conference in @entity0			1
after agreeing , he was asked where he 'd like to do it			0
" @entity3 could have done it at the @entity120 , but he said at @entity43 's , " said @entity56			1
" and it was n't a great neighborhood then ... because after the riots of 1968 many middle class @entity81 moved away , businesses that were looted and burned and never reopened			0
" the turbulent ' 60s following the assassination of @entity88 , riots caused many businesses to close due to curfew restrictions placed in @entity0 @entity8 should have been one of them , but civil rights activist @entity132 would n't hear of it -- he convinced local authorities to keep @entity43 's open past the street 's evening curfew , one of the only establishments in the area to be able to do so			1
despite the curfew , though , the restaurant still faced threats in the streets and the owners worried about the safety of their workers			2
" we took some crayon and wrote on the window ' @entity153 ' to identify the business as an @entity81 business , " explains @entity56 , who adds that the restaurant was fortunately spared from destruction			2
following that turbulent period , the @entity156 moved to the suburbs , causing the neighborhood to deteriorate and ultimately inviting the drug dealers to the street corners			0
@entity56 explains that it was a difficult time , but the restaurant 's troubles did n't end there			1
in the 80s , the construction of the @entity167 's @entity166 closed every store on the street			2
@entity43 's stayed open , though , fighting through the boarded up buildings and thin customer base			1
they survived by employing one person at that time and eventually catering to the construction workers			0
mean something to the city on the restaurant 's 40th anniversary , @entity56 and her husband were in @entity48 when their son called them and told them they were going to host a small celebration			2
he later called them back , urging them to return to the @entity53 because the party was going to be " a little bigger " than he had planned			0
when @entity56 and her husband arrived , they were blown away by the sheer amount of television crews and people who had shown up in support			0
" what was really profound for me was that people came from this city , from this community , and stood in line for hours just to come in and buy a hotdog , " says @entity56			0
" i just felt , wow , this is @entity0 , this is our community			0
maybe we really mean something to this neighborhood			0
maybe we really mean something to the folks of this city			0
