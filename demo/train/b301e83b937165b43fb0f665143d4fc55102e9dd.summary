-- he played the ukelele , weighed in on the @entity4 debacle and even flashed his prehistoric flip cell phone			1
suffice it to say , we got to see another side of @entity9 during an interview with @entity11 tuesday night			1
accompanied by his son and grandson , the billionaire investor gave his unique take on almost everything			2
and with that , he let @entity11 and @entity18 take a quick peek in his wallet			1
here are some of the highlights			2
on @entity4 and @entity23 @entity9 has in the past supported president @entity25			1
and it seems that this support extends to embattled @entity18 secretary of health and human services @entity23			2
@entity9 says give @entity23 some time to fix the @entity4 mess she is overseeing			1
" i am a friend of @entity23 's			2
and i 'm a friend of her when she 's in trouble			2
i feel sorry for her in the position she 's in			0
obviously , it 's a huge screw up but it will get worked out , " @entity9 told @entity11			1
on technology can you tell a lot about the wealth of a man from his cell phone ? apparently not when it comes to the 83 - year - old financial guru			1
" this is the one @entity48 gave me , " joked @entity9 , as he revealed a @entity44 flip phone , a relic compared to today 's smartphones			1
" i do n't throw anything away until i 've had it 20 or 25 years			0
" by the way , @entity9 's son , @entity50 , did not bring a phone to the interview			1
and grandson @entity54 led the three generations when it came to technology			0
@entity9 's standoffish approach to technology extends to e-mail			1
" i sent one e-mail in my life , " revealed @entity9			1
" i sent it to @entity65 at @entity66 and it ended up in court in @entity68 , so i am one for one			0
" on his biggest mistake when you are one of the richest people in the world , it is hard to say you made many mistakes			1
" i bought a company in the mid- 90s called @entity77 and paid $ 400 million for it , " @entity9 said			1
" and it went to zero			0
and i gave about $ 400 million worth of @entity80 stock , which is probably now worth $ 400 billion			2
but i 've made lots of dumb decisions			0
that 's part of the game			0
" on his wallet @entity9 says he has been carrying the same wallet for 20 years			1
and when @entity11 asked @entity9 to show @entity18 what is inside , he obliged			2
he whipped out the black wallet for a split second			2
if you blinked you missed it			0
the highlights : a family picture			0
and an @entity98 card from 1964			0
" it goes with the cell phone , " @entity9 joked about the almost 50 - year - old credit card			1
on the shutdown showdown at least one part of the recent battle between @entity105 and @entity106 that caused a 16 - day government shutdown should never happen again , @entity9 says			1
the battle should not take place around whether to raise the debt ceiling limit , he said			0
it could be catastrophic to the economy			0
" i think that both parties should declare the debt limit as a political weapon of mass destruction which ca n't be used , " he said			0
" i mean , it is silly to have a country that has 237 years building up its reputation and then have people threaten to tear it down because they 're not getting some other matter			0
" on investment who would n't ask the " @entity9 , " who made his fortune investing , for a stock tip ? fans watching the interview needled @entity11 via @entity129 to ask the @entity131 billionaire how he would invest $ 1,000 right now			1
@entity9 's answer : " well you asked , " he coyly told @entity11			2
" you 've done your job			0
" it seems investment advice does n't come easy			0
" i ca n't even get an answer to that question , " @entity50 joked			0
