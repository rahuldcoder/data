the foiled plot to assassinate @entity2 prime minister @entity1 just days before the presidential election is certain to strengthen his margin of victory at the polls on sunday			1
not surprisingly , the timing of the revelation -- three weeks elapsed between the key arrest in the case and its public announcement -- has fueled speculation that the whole affair was cooked up by the @entity1 camp as an 11th - hour surprise in order to guarantee @entity1 's re-election			2
whether that may be the case , the reality is that even before the plot was revealed , independent projections showed @entity1 will win the election to become president of @entity2 once again			1
in recent weeks , @entity24 media coverage of the @entity2 presidential election has focused on the remarkable series of protests across @entity2 against the falsified parliamentary elections in december and the @entity1 political machine that rigged them			1
@entity31 of all political stripes bravely and peacefully gathered to demonstrate against @entity1 's authoritarian grip on power			1
to some , this may have looked like @entity36 of the @entity1 era			2
yet , missing from this narrative is the irony that many @entity2 liberals who genuinely despise @entity1 would probably vote for him if they thought he might actually lose			1
how can this possibly be ? the short answer is that at present , the alternatives to @entity1 are much worse for @entity2 and for its liberals in particular and the liberals know it			1
the other four presidential candidates are not along the liberal , democratic left but rather along the chauvinist , xenophobic and anti-semitic right			2
moreover , a @entity2 without @entity1 at the helm would probably be plunged into political chaos or worse			1
currently , @entity1 alone has been able to balance the various and powerful economic and paramilitary factions			0
all politically observant @entity31 know this			0
only the @entity55 , @entity56 , has any chance of obtaining more than 10 % of the popular vote			0
the remaining three candidates are long shots			0
there 's @entity62 , himself a creature of the @entity65 in the late @entity67 era who , like the talentless @entity56 , has been running hopelessly for president for 20 years and has even tried to claim @entity70 for @entity2			0
then there 's @entity72 of @entity73 who is pro-putin and predicts a @entity1 victory			0
finally , there 's billionaire @entity77 , whose website was hacked and pasted with @entity80 pronouncements just before he announced his candidacy			0
none of these four candidates has a plausible program for administering the country or a body of specialists capable of doing so			0
this political farce has been compounded by the last - minute disqualification of @entity90 , a liberal economist			0
his candidacy came into question after the @entity93 said he did n't have enough signatures of support for his application			0
no doubt @entity1 worried that a @entity90 candidacy might attract enough votes -- even if just 10 % -- that together with votes for the other four candidates might have deprived him of an absolute majority in the first round of voting			1
this would have resulted in an embarrassing runoff election			0
but @entity1 was also concerned about the fact that as a candidate , @entity90 would have the legal right , which he was well prepared to exploit , to deploy election monitors throughout the country and thereby question the legitimacy of a @entity1 victory			2
why does this matter ? those opposed to @entity1 can deploy about 30,000 election monitors for sunday 's election			2
but @entity2 has more than 90,000 polling stations			0
with three independent election monitors planned for each station in @entity121 , relatively few will be left to patrol the immense space in the rest of @entity2 , leaving the field clear for @entity1 's political machine to tweak outcomes as it sees fit			1
@entity1 will thus certainly receive a handsome majority of the votes on march 4			1
but he 's not taking any chances			0
in addition to the usual tactic of exerting pressure on @entity2 's media , in recent weeks , the government has intervened to change the board of the most important independent radio station in the country , the @entity137			0
there is no question that @entity1 will win the presidency			2
but what will he do after he wins ? how will he react to the growing signs of dissatisfaction to his rule ? is he up to the task of fundamentally reforming an authoritarian political machine that despite its accomplishments in restoring stability , a modicum of prosperity and international respect after the @entity151 years seems incapable of shaping @entity2 into a truly modern society ? absent real political reform , @entity2 will be condemned to the status of a petroleum state a la russe and consigned to the margins of the world economy and culture			1
should @entity1 decide to broaden the base of his government and introduce meaningful elements of political accountability to public affairs , he would have to wage a titanic war against his own loyalists , who altogether control nearly half of @entity2 's economic assets			1
how @entity1 navigates his next presidency will ultimately determine his reputation in @entity2 history .			1

@entity2 is holding presidential election on march 4 ; @entity1 is expected to win
@entity176 : the alternative candidates to @entity1 are much worse for @entity2
he says a @entity2 without @entity1 at the helm would probably be plunged into political chaos
@entity176 : if @entity1 does n't embrace reform , @entity2 will not become a truly modern society
