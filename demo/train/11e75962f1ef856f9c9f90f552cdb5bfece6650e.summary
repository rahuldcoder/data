@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has been setting out his vision for the country in a speech to the loya jirga , or national assembly			1
@entity2 called the four - day assembly to sound out tribal elders on a long - term pact with the @entity13 military			1
he has already been critical of @entity14 , calling on limits to the remit of foreign troops			0
" we want our sovereignty from today , " he told the meeting			0
@entity1 correspondents say the assembly is considered by many as an important step towards any possible peace deal with elements of the insurgency , and a test of @entity2 's strength as a cohesive leader			1
but the meeting has also drawn criticism			0
the @entity34 's @entity33 questions its purpose and reports unnamed diplomats and @entity3 politicians describing it as a piece of political theater that exists to rubber stamp decisions made by the president 's inner circle			1
and in a recent interview with the @entity46 , former presidential candidate @entity44 accused @entity2 of " manipulating the system for his benefit			2
" the @entity50 has threatened to attack anyone who attends , and has published on a website what it claimed was government security plans for the meeting			0
the @entity58 has dismissed them as fake			0
@entity61 examines some key questions for @entity1 about the assembly and whether it still has a role			2
what is the loya jirga ? according to the 2004 @entity3 constitution , loya jirgas ( or grand assemblies ) are held to take decisions relating to @entity3 's independence , sovereignty , territorial integrity and the " supreme interests of the country , " to amend the constitution or to prosecute the president			1
the current loya jirga is intended to discuss a proposed longer - term military relationship with the @entity13 as well as ways to push forward reconciliation with the @entity50			1
the constitution also states that loya jirgas consist of members of the national assembly and the chairpersons of the provincial and district councils			2
however , tribal elders , religious leaders and representatives of civil society , also attend			0
in turn , a number of parliamentarians are boycotting the meeting			0
how did it originate ? jirgas originated as a means of resolving differences between different @entity101 tribes ( or clans )			1
traditionally , @entity101 tribal elders and religious leaders held jirgas to meet to discuss problems , appoint new leaders and so forth			1
from the late 19th century representatives of @entity3 's other ethnic groups -- such as @entity110 , hazaras and @entity112 -- were invited and the process became more formalized			2
some commentators have questioned its function			0
why are they so critical ? the fundamental criticism of the loya jirga is that it sidelines the democratic institutions such as the parliament set up in recent years			1
the 250 members of @entity3 's lower house are marginalized by the 1,800 non-elected attendees of the meeting			2
this raises questions over the depth of democracy within the country			0
at the same time , a number of parliamentarians fear that president @entity2 is planning to use the meeting to push through constitutional changes that would allow him to remain in power once his current term ends			1
at present the president is only allowed to serve two terms			0
@entity2 has denied these claims			2
why has the @entity50 chosen to target the loya jirga ? one of the main subjects for discussion at the loya jirga is whether to allow the @entity13 to maintain a longer - term military presence in @entity3			1
many @entity3 believe that without a @entity13 presence , their country will be vulnerable to interference by its neighbors , as well as to the @entity50			2
the @entity50 is attempting to position itself as a force resisting occupation , so aside from simply demonstrating its military reach , the loya jirga may make a decision which undermines their primary demand which is for foreign forces to leave			1
at the same time , the other element of the loya jirga is to push forward reconciliation with the @entity50			1
there is widespread public support within @entity3 for the reconciliation process but an absence of strategy over how to push the process forward , particularly in the aftermath of the assassination of the head of the @entity169 , @entity170 , in september			1
however , amongst @entity172 in particular , there is greater wariness of any moves that would allow the @entity50 to return to power			0
many of those most opposed have boycotted the meeting			0
who gains from this meeting ? the @entity13 will be pleased if the meeting backs the idea of military - bases			0
if the meeting provides a political strategy to deal with the @entity50 , then it would be deemed a success			0
on the other hand , if the meeting fails to deliver then @entity2 's position will be weakened			2
having chosen to sideline the democratic institutions , he needs to demonstrate that he does have a wider support base among traditional power structures			1
do tribal and ethnic affiliations still have a bearing ? tribal and ethnic affiliations remain strong in @entity3 society , and particularly in rural areas			1
with a multitude of languages spoken in @entity3 , most @entity3 first identify with others who speak the same language			2
however , tribal , familial and geographic identities are also important			0
many @entity3 place their " clan " identity before their " ethnic " identity			2
such localized loyalties appear to have intensified as society broke down during the @entity209 occupation and in the subsequent civil war			0
so is there a future for this loya jirga system of government ? while notions of tribal identity remain strong , there will be a constant temptation to sideline elected institutions			1
at the same time , the " democratic " institutions also have an over-representation of " traditional " tribal leaders			1
political power stems from gaining votes : tribal leaders frequently decide which way their group will vote in the hope of gaining access to patronage in the future			0
at the same time , political parties are also sidelined in the current political system , reinforcing a system in which access to power and resources stems from family links rather than political differences			0
both factors suggest that the power of tribal elites , and hence of jirgas , is going to remain a factor in @entity3 politics for a while			1
in time , if @entity3 was to undergo a sustained period of economic development and urbanization it would seem reasonable to assume that traditional power structures would be replaced by newer democratic institutions , based on merit or political ideology rather than birthright			1
however , for the foreseeable future , that seems a long way off			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity61 .			0

jirgas originated as a way of resolving differences between different @entity101 tribes
@entity61 says a criticism of the loya jirga is that it sidelines democratic institutions
@entity61 adds that @entity2 needs to demonstrate that he has wider support among traditional power structures
he says the power of tribal elites is going to remain a factor in @entity3 politics for a while
