@entity0 -- a political standoff that spanned five decades and 10 presidents began to crumble wednesday with president @entity6 's move to normalize relations with @entity8			1
the announcement was the product of a year of clandestine back - channelling between the @entity11 and @entity8 , facilitated by the @entity12 and the @entity13 and with personal involvement from the @entity15			2
" today , @entity18 chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past , so as to reach for a better future for the @entity8 people , for the @entity11 people , for our entire hemisphere and for the world , " @entity6 said in a statement announcing his decision			1
he added : " it 's time for a new approach			0
" @entity6 said he 's instructed secretary of state @entity28 to immediately begin discussions with @entity8 to re-establish diplomatic relations , and that the @entity11 will re-open an embassy in @entity32			1
the administration will also allow some travel and trade that had been banned under a decades - long embargo instated during the @entity38 administration			0
" neither the @entity11 nor @entity8 people are well - served by a rigid policy that 's rooted in events that took place before most of us were born , " @entity6 said			1
@entity6 's move risks triggering another fight with @entity45 , which will come under the full control of @entity47 in january			1
sen. @entity48 , @entity49 , told @entity1 's @entity50 he would do everything in his power to block any potential @entity11 ambassador to @entity8 even receive a vote			2
he also called the easing of economic restrictions " inexplicable " in a statement			2
" appeasing the @entity59 brothers will only cause other tyrants from @entity61 to @entity62 to @entity63 to see that they can take advantage of president @entity6 's naiveté during his final two years in office			1
as a result , @entity18 will be less safe as a result of the president 's change in policy , " he said			0
@entity48 promised that as the incoming chairman of the @entity82 's @entity81 subcommittee , he 'll " make every effort to block this dangerous and desperate attempt by the president to burnish his legacy at the @entity8 people 's [ sic ] expense			1
" related : five reasons why the @entity8 deal happened speaking at the same time as @entity6 from his own country , @entity8 president @entity59 lauded the move			1
" this expression by president @entity6 deserves the respect and recognition by all the people and i want to thank and recognize support from the @entity13 and especially from @entity92 for the improvement of relations between @entity8 and the @entity11 , " he said			1
@entity6 's announcement comes as both nations have released political prisoners in a show of goodwill , with @entity11 @entity100 headed home on " humanitarian " grounds from @entity8 early wednesday morning			1
in a separate swap , a @entity11 intelligence source held for 20 years was released in exchange for three jailed @entity8 spies			2
@entity6 said he and @entity59 spoke tuesday in a phone call that lasted about an hour and reflected the first communication at the presidential level with @entity8 since the @entity8 revolution			1
but some @entity47 are warning the move will only strengthen the @entity59 regime in @entity8 , which has long been accused of human rights abuses and is listed by the @entity114 as a state sponsor of terrorism			1
@entity6 said wednesday he has instructed @entity28 , however , to review @entity8 's place on the @entity118 list			1
wednesday 's announcement that the @entity11 will move toward restoring diplomatic ties with @entity8 will also make it easier for @entity11 to travel to @entity8 and do business with the @entity8 people by extending general licenses , officials said			1
while the more liberal travel restrictions wo n't allow for tourism , they will permit greater @entity11 travel to the island			1
while only @entity45 can formally overturn the five decades - long embargo , the @entity130 has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island			2
and @entity6 said he plans to " engage @entity45 in an honest and serious conversation " on lifting it			1
in an effort to boost the nascent @entity8 private sector , the president will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to @entity8 , particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences , and allow greater business training , as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island			1
other announced changes permit @entity11 and @entity8 banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards			1
@entity11 travelers will be allowed to import up to $ 400 worth of goods from @entity8 , including $ 100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even @entity8 cigars			2
remittances by @entity11 to their families back in @entity8 will also be increased to approximately $ 2,000 per quarter			2
senior administration officials and @entity8 observers have said recent reforms on the island and changing attitudes in the @entity11 have created an opening for improved relations			1
@entity11 and @entity8 officials say @entity0 and @entity32 in recent months have increased official technical - level contacts on a variety of issues			2
related : five reasons why the @entity8 deal happened both @entity6 and @entity59 in their wednesday remarks acknowledged the nations ' differences remain			1
" i do not expect the changes i am announcing today to bring about a transformation of @entity8 society overnight , " @entity6 said			1
but he argued that " through a policy of engagement , we can more effectively stand up for our values , and help the @entity8 people help themselves as they move into the 21st century			1
" @entity59 said that even as the two nations " recognize having profound differences — especially in national sovereignty , democracy , human rights and foreign relations policies — we reaffirm our willingness to dialogue in all of these area			2
" to that end , @entity8 has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the @entity11			2
at least one of the prisoners has already been released			0

@entity92 — the first pope from @entity18 — encouraged @entity6 in a letter and in their meeting this year to renew talks with @entity8 on pursuing a closer relationship			1
@entity100 ' release was seen as one of the first clear benefits of those talks			0

" five - and - a - half decades of history shows us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment			0
two wrongs do n't make a right			0
