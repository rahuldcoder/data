@entity0 -- workers at the @entity6 nuclear power station returned to the plant friday after a strong aftershock forced them to leave a day earlier , the plant 's owner said			1
the quake forced crews at the plant to evacuate as it rattled northern @entity12 late thursday night			1
they returned to the plant about eight and a half hours later , and no fresh damage to the facility had been reported friday afternoon , the @entity13 said			1
before the quake , engineers had been injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the no. 1 reactor containment shell to counter a buildup of hydrogen in the chamber			0
that process continued while the plant was evacuated , and so did the pumping of fresh water into that reactor and units 2 and 3 , said @entity29 , a spokesman for the @entity30			1
hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors , which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami			1
the nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell , reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance @entity13 called " extremely low			0
" a hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the no 1			0
reactor building two days after the quake , and another blast two days later blew apart the no. 3 building			0
a suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the no. 2 reactor on march 15 as well			0
both the @entity56 and the @entity57 have rated thursday 's quake a magnitude 7.1 , though the @entity12 initially rated it at 7.4			2
it was centered in the @entity60 about 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) north of the plant , near the epicenter of the magnitude - 9 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out the plant 's coolant systems four weeks ago friday			2
it also caused radioactive water to spill from the spent fuel cooling pools of another nuclear power plant , @entity73 's @entity72 plant , the @entity75 - based utility and @entity30 reported friday			1
about 15 liters ( 3.9 gallons ) of water spilled , and the concentration of radioactive particles was far below levels that would pose an immediate threat to human health , the company said			1
the three reactors at the @entity72 plant , about 140 kilometers ( 88 miles ) north of @entity6 , shut down automatically when the march 11 earthquake struck and have not been restarted			1
workers at @entity6 have been struggling to keep the reactors from overheating for four weeks , pouring tons of fresh water an hour into the reactors and trying to contain the spread of radioactive contamination that has been pouring out			1
about 78,000 people who live within a 20 - kilometer radius of the plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the quake , and another 62,000 within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors			2
but government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long - term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation , chief cabinet secretary @entity98 told reporters thursday			2
@entity98 , the @entity12 government 's point man on the crisis , said the country may set standards for long - term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged plant			2
" it is time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure , " @entity98 told reporters			0
" the safety of the people is the first priority , and social needs come after that			0
" there is no timetable for a decision , @entity98 said			0
readings released thursday by the country 's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long - term exposure could top the government 's one - time standards for an evacuation within a few months			2
some of those are in towns to the northwest , where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the @entity6 plant			1
the recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long - term risk of cancer , according to medical experts			0
the anti-nuclear group @entity149 and the @entity150 raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30 - kilometer zone in late march			0
@entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report for @entity1 .			0
