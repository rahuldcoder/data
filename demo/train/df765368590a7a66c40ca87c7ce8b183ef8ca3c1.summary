@entity0 : what are you trying to tell us ? that 's what the @entity6 is agonizing over after she posted a photo on @entity10 of herself on sunday			1
the caption-less picture shows the " @entity16 " pop diva on the beach , buried in sand			1
the pronounced piles of sand on her stomach and breasts led some of her @entity10 followers to speculate that she was dropping pregnancy hints			0
either that , or @entity26 needs to work on her sandcastles			0
the move is classic @entity0 , who has a history of game - ifying the message when it comes to personal announcements			1
she revealed her first pregnancy at the 2011 @entity36 by stripping off her blazer at the end of her performance to show off her baby bump			0
since then , the @entity6 and entertainment media has been obsessed with searching for clues to her next pregnancy			0
@entity45 published a lengthy post in december citing evidence that @entity0 has been pregnant for months			2
bottom line : we 'll know for sure when @entity0 is ready for us to know .			2
