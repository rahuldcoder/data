-- can a piece of paper save a marriage ? one suburban @entity5 couple figured it was worth trying so they entered into a legal agreement to manage a major source of tension in their relationship - money			1
the couple , in their late 50s , met in college , dated for six years , married and had two children			1
and they fought constantly over their finances			2
the husband and wife , who asked to remain anonymous , had taken out two mortgages on their home and spent inheritance money to pay down debt from the husband 's consulting business			2
" i would lie awake at night thinking we 're going to lose the house and lose everything we ever worked for , " says the wife , who teaches at a local university			2
" this was with me 24 - 7			2
" she valued stability ; he saw debt as a means of building his business			2
several marriage counselors could n't help them come to terms with their different attitudes toward money			1
then they came across an article about marital mediation , and it mentioned postnuptial agreements			1
" it 's the same concept as a prenuptial agreement , " says @entity47 attorney @entity46 , co-author of " @entity49 , you do ... but just sign here : a @entity54 and @entity53 to @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
" " instead of being done before a marriage , it 's done during a marriage , " he says			1
@entity62 , while much less common than prenuptial agreements , are gaining in popularity			1
nearly 50 percent of attorneys polled by the @entity65 of @entity66 reported an increase in the number of postnups from 2002 to 2007			0
the agreements usually are used to settle financial issues , says @entity46 , whose high - profile clients have included @entity73 , chief executive of the @entity75 , as well as author @entity76 and boxer @entity77			0
@entity62 might be used to determine who owns assets , set a budget for household expenses or remove a business from the table in the event of a divorce			1
couples also have used them to decide such things as how often the mother - in - law gets to visit or how many boys - only weekends the husband gets to take			0
' i was able to breathe easier ' a postnuptial or mediated agreement can help save a couple 's relationship -- if that 's their goal			1
" in cases where couples want to stay married , it can apply very efficiently , " says @entity97 , @entity98 , attorney @entity99			0
" if they do n't want to stay married , it 's hopeless			0
" the @entity5 couple , who had been married 30 years , fell in the former camp			1
@entity99 helped them put into writing a mutually acceptable financial plan			0
they agreed to transfer their house into the wife 's name , both to address her fear of losing the asset and to insulate it from the husband 's business debts , and to split the mortgage and other household expenses			0
that was 18 months ago , and they credit the post-nuptial agreement with helping them become a mutually supportive couple again			1
" in my case , i wanted financial security -- not necessarily a new @entity126 every year , but to feel some financial security , " she says			0
" what he wanted was emotional support from me			0
" the agreement largely has quelled their arguments , they say , even though the husband 's consulting business is still between $ 150,000 and $ 200,000 in debt			1
" i do n't think the issue has ever totally gone away , " the wife says , " but i feel like i was able to breathe easier ... without this being in the forefront all of the time			0
" most couples do use the postnups as a blueprint for an eventual divorce , according to @entity146 , a @entity147 , @entity148 , conflict strategist and mediator			1
but she thinks successful mediation can reveal the potential to save a marriage			1
" the very process of working on this arrangement is a positive exercise for most couples , " @entity146 says			0
" people will say ( a postnup ) ruins the romance , it ruins the love			1
if you ca n't have difficult discussions , that 's a death knell for a marriage			1
" @entity167 takes three lawyers both husband and wife should have a postnup reviewed by their own lawyers or it 's not likely to withstand a legal test			1
for the @entity5 couple , that meant $ 5,000 in fees : @entity99 drew up the agreement and then they each hired individual lawyers review it			1
getting a second opinion also allows the couple to make sure the terms are right for them			2
the husband 's lawyer advised him against signing over the house , but he says he trusted his wife and felt it was the right move			0
" i was told she could walk off with the house and leave ( me ) in the cold , " he says			0
" i viewed it as , i had used up my amount of equity in the house with the amount of debt i had			0
it was n't ( my wife 's ) fault			0
i would rather have the debt on my shoulders and not have the emotional problems			0
" both view their postnup as the reason they made it to their 30th wedding anniversary			2
" we both feel it saved our marriage , " the wife says			2
" it did n't make our problems go away , but it allowed us to keep going as a couple			2
