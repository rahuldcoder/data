-- in @entity4 , @entity5 , the anger and despair of the refugees is palpable			1
two refugee camps have been set up there , nine miles from the border with @entity9			1
as @entity12 's @entity11 , i made the dangerous 280 - mile journey out to @entity4 to help with our distribution of urgently needed newborn kits and to hear the stories of the families			1
although in numbers they are fewer than their counterparts in @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , their suffering and needs are no less pronounced , especially given their low profile , the extreme challenges that organizations are facing in reaching them , the lack of funding and the minimal services in the area			1
@entity12 is one of very few organizations supporting the more than 8,000 @entity9 refugees living in very difficult circumstances in this hardly accessible area in the far western corner of @entity5			1
i shiver despite the noon sun. temperatures are no more than 50 degrees @entity42 ( 10 degrees celsius )			1
thirteen - year - old @entity43 is stoic			1
" you should be here at night to really feel it			1
" he beams a smile at me			1
i force myself to ignore the icy air			1
the thick baby blanket that we included in the newborn kits will come in very handy			1
i 'm struck by the tidiness of @entity55 's tent			1
there are no possessions ; just five sponge mattresses where 14 people sleep			1
as i sit cross-legged , the cold bites ; i retreat to a kneeling position while the girls giggle shyly			2
these girls are attending the child - friendly space that we have helped set up for kids here			2
these children have been exposed to much pain , uncertainty , fear , displacement -- they really need the stability and normalcy that child - friendly spaces can offer			2
the stories come fast and furious			2
" what have we done to deserve this ? look at our children just in t - shirts			2
no one has proper shoes , not even socks			2
my daughter - in - law had to flee for her life with seven children ... her husband is still there			2
he 's my son ; i do n't know where or how he is			2
" @entity55 's daughters and their friends fill the tent with their stories -- of children 's dirty clothes , of not showering in more than four weeks , of water too muddy to even make tea			2
her cheeks are swollen and yellowish as are those of many of the older children			0
" @entity100 " ( jaundice ) , confirms @entity55			0
she says the clinic offers no help			0
one mother hugs her 3 - year - old daughter			0
" i 'm just watching my child get sicker every day and there is nothing i can do			0
" another woman , @entity109 , wordlessly pulls the base of the tent out to show me how damp the gravel is under the tent			0
" it seeps into those sponge mattresses , into our bones , into our skin			0
there is no way of staying warm or dry			0
" her husband shows me the deep crevice dug by their resident rats			0
" all night they crawl under us , trying to get warmth			0
the children scream , and i spend all night beating the rats out			0
" as i walk out , the tears rise in me			0
it hurts to look into the despair on the children 's faces , to see a toddler barefoot on the gravel			0
there is so much that needs to be done			0
without support these children truly suffer			0
as winter tightens its grip on @entity9 's neighboring countries , stories like those i heard in @entity4 are far from unique			1
@entity148 estimates that the number of refugee children in the region has surpassed 250,000 , and that number continues to climb			0
they lack medical care , adequate food , warmth and clean water			0
in @entity4 , @entity12 has already provided hygiene kits for all families , 430 newborn kits and is helping 520 children through the child - friendly spaces			1
regionally , @entity12 has reached 80,000 children and families so far and is working to triple our response in @entity24 , @entity5 and @entity23			1
as with all other organizations responding to the humanitarian needs of the @entity9 refugees in the region , our greatest challenge is funding			1
we are on the ground			0
we have established operations in @entity4 , which is no small feat. we are ready to deliver aid immediately but we need the funds to make it happen			1
that night , i can not get warm , despite the blankets and thick walls			0
i can not stop thinking of the children , out in the desert cold			0
