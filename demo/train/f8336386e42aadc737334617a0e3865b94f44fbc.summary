some 6.8 million college students will graduate in @entity1 this summer , an exhilarating time for students and their families alike			1
i know the feeling : @entity7 , my 21 - year - old daughter , has just graduated from college too			2
when i got my history diploma at @entity12 in 1981 , the only memorable ceremony we had was a group photo with fellow history majors and our teachers			2
over the years , graduations from @entity1 universities have become elaborate affairs with students dressed in black gowns strutting the red carpet at formal ceremonies , before posing for the obligatory group pictures			1
this year , some students are breaking with convention -- striving to project their individuality , exercise free speech or simply to be a bit naughty and different			1
several photos recently posted on @entity1 micro-blogging sites show graduates illustrate this			1
one particularly eye - catching example shows advertising majors at @entity35 in @entity36 standing in front of a banner which reads " @entity40 , you f * * * ed my youth ! " each graduate also holds a printout expressing his or her personal wish , such as finding a wealthy wife			1
the picture predictably attracted a huge response			2
" it is innovation , " gushed one micro-blogger			2
" " what a great campaign by ad majors , " enthused @entity57 , an independent media consultant in @entity58			1
" any ad agency would be lucky to have young folks who can create such a stir online so quickly			1
" not everyone is impressed			2
" now the graduation photos of college students excessively pursue unconventional and new things in order to be different , " said blogger @entity63			1
" it 's a bit too much ! " @entity1 writer and cultural critic @entity69 agreed			1
" if i hire people , i would n't hire any students from this university and would put this university on the blacklist			1
" but @entity69 's comments also came under fire			2
" why not look at the question with a more relaxed perspective ? " asked one netizen known as @entity79			2
" maybe this last craziness will become the students ' precious memories			1
" another , called @entity86 , wrote : " come on , put me on the blacklist too			2
this picture shows the spirit of fighting for freedom in this so - called ' harmonious country			0
' i think the future of @entity1 can be even better if it is determined by these graduates instead of those treacherous fakers			1
" for some observers , the whole debate is about @entity1 's generation gap			1
the older generation grew up experiencing the poverty and chaos of the @entity101			0
governed by rigid rules and puritan conventions , they typically followed rules , or at least feigned compliance			0
three decades of economic reform and the " open - door " policy have brought higher living standards , a modern lifestyle and more freedom			0
traditional @entity1 reticence is disappearing as a result			1
meanwhile , only children dominate the current generation of young @entity1 -- a legacy of @entity1 's one - child policy , instituted in 1978			1
they belong to a generation for whom prosperity and personal freedom are more the norm , rather the exception			2
@entity1 's opening to the outside world has made them better informed , extremely curious and adventurous			1
most of this year 's graduating class belongs to the " jiu ling hou , " or post- 90s generation			0
critics stereotype them as self - centered , @entity132 , spoiled and rebellious			2
they are also labeled as lazy , promiscuous and confused			0
but others describe them as intelligent , innovative , curious and tech - savvy			0
" these are misconceptions and sweeping over-generalizations , " @entity137 , a 26 - year - old white collar worker in @entity58			0
" we are different but we are maturing			0
" a survey conducted by the @entity140 , a @entity58 - based independent research firm , found that among 2,099 university and middle school students sampled from @entity1 's five largest cities , urban @entity1 born in the 1990s have more disposable money and greater say in family spending			1
the survey also showed this generation still retains a realistic attitude about consumption , despite being portrayed as the " spoiled generation			0
" " it 's just a label , " said @entity152 , 20 , who is graduating this month			0
" older generations harbor stereotypes of our generation , saying we are extravagant , we are not socially responsible			0
" but @entity152 concedes many of his contemporaries are self - centered			0
" we are more individualistic , " he said			0
" we have a strong desire to express ourselves in unique and sometimes crazy ways			0
" this is why some students have posted various crazy -- even brazen -- photos on microblogs			1
one shows a man running naked , supposedly celebrating his graduation on the campus of @entity170 , a top - rated school in @entity171 , while another shows a group of youths in their graduation gowns posing for a picture while the building behind them appears to be on fire			1
" in most cases , it 's just people wanting fame -- using the pretext of protest in some cases , " said @entity179 , a graduate student in journalism at @entity181			0
" with the graduation photos , it just seems like what graduates would normally do in a lot of other countries			1
" why is this significant ? " it perhaps says something about the freedom these young people feel now , especially when they 're graduating and free from school authorities			2
i doubt some of the behavior in these pictures would have been tolerated 10 or 20 years ago , " @entity179 said			0
" this is just the result of young @entity1 people starting to enjoy many of the same personal freedoms as their peers abroad : silly , naughty photos are a part of student life everywhere , and @entity1 is no different , " explained @entity202 , founder of @entity202 , a website and research firm that tracks the @entity1 media and @entity206			1
compared to their @entity215 counterparts , @entity137 thinks her contemporaries are still rather conservative			0
" the spirit is the same , " said the 26 - year - old literature graduate			0
" before you enter the adult world , where there are rules and conventions , you savor the last chance and last moment to indulge in teen spirit			0
" for some , the reminders of rules have come quickly			0
many graduates have been pressured to delete their " crazy " pictures from their microblogs .			0

some young students in @entity1 are using their graduation photos to project their individuality
posted on social media , photos show students with *provocative* signs or running naked through their campus
critics say they excessively pursue unconventional and new things in order to be different
but others say this is a result of students starting to enjoy the same personal freedoms as their peers abroad
