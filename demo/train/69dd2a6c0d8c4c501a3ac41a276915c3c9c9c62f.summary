-- rumors of a @entity3 bug has users from all over the world worried about private messages showing up very publicly on timeline pages			1
but the social network is debunking those claims , saying these messages are actually just older wall posts			1
a series of reports coming out of @entity14 â € ” including ones from @entity14 and @entity16 â € ” claim that @entity3 members who sent private messages over the past few years have been popping up on public posts			2
some members in the @entity22 have said their private messages from 2007 and 2008 are showing up on their timeline , but @entity3 told @entity0 that the company has n't found a bug and believes the discrepancy comes from a wider roll out of the newer timeline layout on a global scale			2
@entity3 says that if you can comment or like that activity , then it is a wall post and not a private message			0
in the past , users were n't able to comment and like posts , so @entity3 believes members new to @entity38 are confusing old posts for private messages			1
see also : 50 % of @entity42 a @entity44 's @entity43 [ @entity45 ] " a small number of users raised concerns after what they mistakenly believed to be private messages appeared on their timeline , " @entity46 of @entity47 said in a statement			0
" our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users ' profile pages			1
@entity3 is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy			0
" update : when asked if such a bug were possible , @entity65 responded : " while not quite a technical impossibility , these systems are run on two separate backends which would require a non-trivial amount of work for this bug to be real			0
" we have been unable to confirm any case where private information has been leaked			0
for those worried that they may be subject to a bug , users can set all wall posts to only friends or just to themselves , and also hide the activity			2

some users say old private @entity3 messages are appearing on their @entity38
@entity3 : these messages are actually just older wall posts
social network says two separate systems make such a bug unlikely
