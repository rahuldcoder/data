-- a year ago on april 15 , two brothers of @entity3 heritage who were raised in @entity4 , @entity5 , were alleged to have carried out a spectacular bombing at the @entity7 that killed three , wounded more than 200 and led to a massive manhunt that paralyzed the city and its suburbs for days			0
the older brother , @entity11 , was killed in a shootout with police shortly after the bombing , while the younger brother , @entity15 , surrendered to authorities and is awaiting trial			1
as is often the case with big news events , much of what we understood to be the case in the immediate aftermath of the event and what we now know about the bombing a year later are quite different			0
consider that shortly after the bombing , it was widely assumed @entity11 had traveled to @entity29 in southern @entity30 a year earlier to meet and train with some of the @entity32 rebels there who are fighting the @entity30 army			1
many commentators , including us , thought it was quite unlikely that the brothers could have learned how to construct two effective bombs that blew up within seconds of each other at the @entity7 without some kind of specialized training such as what could be obtained from the rebels in @entity29			1
also , at first blush , the @entity11 brothers appeared to be so - called " clean skins " who had no previous history of criminality , and therefore there was little reason that law enforcement should have been monitoring either of them			1
similarly , both appeared to be regular guys with no history of mental disorders			0
all of these assumptions have turned out to be wrong			0
here are four things we 've learned since then : one : there is no evidence @entity11 had any contact with @entity32 militants overseas			1
in january 2012 , @entity11 left @entity5 for a six - month trip to @entity29			1
there he became close to members of an organization called the @entity68 , a nonviolent group that is critical of the @entity69			0
he also began attending a mosque that was frequented by hardline @entity71			0
@entity30 security officials claim he met with @entity32 extremists in @entity29 , but @entity69 intelligence services have not been able to confirm those allegations			0
@entity30 officials also found " frequent " electronic communication between @entity78 and @entity30 - @entity81 extremist @entity79 , but @entity83 officials in @entity84 say it is unlikely the two made contact in person while @entity11 was in @entity29			1
media sources in the region have also alleged that @entity11 met with @entity90 , who was reportedly a recruiter for @entity32 fighters in the region			1
@entity90 was killed in a raid by @entity30 forces on may 19 , 2012			0
again , official @entity69 investigators have not unearthed any evidence that supports this claim			0
and experts on the security climate in @entity29 say it is unlikely that @entity11 could have met with known extremists and not have then been detained and questioned by the @entity30 security service on his way out of the country ( which did n't happen )			1
two : the @entity11 brothers did not have any formal training in bomb building			1
instead , they apparently followed bomb - making instructions they found in an english - language @entity112 webzine			2
the @entity114 released an extensive report last month on the @entity117 bombings that did not mention that either of the @entity119 had received any professional training on how to build an explosive device			2
rather , they appear to have followed step - by - step instructions for how to build a bomb that were published in 2011 in @entity125 , a webzine produced by @entity127 ( @entity127 ) that is targeted at @entity128 - speaking @entity71			0
three : the @entity83 now alleges that @entity11 was implicated in a triple homicide in @entity130 , @entity5 , in 2011			2
on may 22 , 2013 , a month after the @entity117 bombings , @entity131 was shot and killed by an @entity83 agent after @entity133 attacked him with a pole while he was being interrogated at his apartment in @entity136			2
according to the @entity83 , @entity131 was about to sign a written statement implicating himself and @entity11 in the murders of @entity139 , @entity139 and @entity140 on september 11 , 2011			2
investigators reported that the victims ' throats were slashed so viciously that they were almost decapitated , and their bodies were strewn with a pound and a half of high - quality marijuana			0
another 8 and a half pounds of marijuana was left in jars and bags around the apartment , as well as about $ 5,000 in cash , and there was no sign of forced entry			0
therefore , the murderers appeared to know the three victims			0
mess was one of @entity11 's best friends , but the law enforcement officials never questioned the elder @entity11 brother about the case , and it remained unsolved until after the @entity119 were identified as the main suspects in the @entity117 bombings			1
if the @entity83 allegations are correct , @entity11 was a dangerous killer well before the @entity117 bombings and a more thorough investigation of the triple homicide in @entity130 , @entity5 could well have derailed the @entity7 plot			1
four : @entity11 may have had mental health problems			2
according to an excellent investigation of the @entity11 brothers by the @entity172 , @entity11 told his mother , @entity173 , " that he felt there were two people living inside of him , " according to @entity178 , a @entity3 who knew the @entity181 parents			1
@entity11 also told @entity182 , a friend at the mosque he attended , that he heard two angry voices inside his head telling him to do things			2
could some kind of intervention by a mental health professional have helped @entity11 with his problems and averted the @entity7 plot ? this question can not , of course , be answered , but what is clear is that the @entity117 bombings were not directed by @entity112 or an allied group and are part of a trend in the @entity69 over the past years in which fewer terrorist plots have any kind of a connection to an overseas terrorist organization			1
they are also part of a related trend in which plots no longer involve groups of conspirators but are carried out either by individuals or by pairs such as the @entity11 brothers			2
in a sense , this reflects a victory for law enforcement efforts			0
lone - wolf type attacks of the kind we saw in @entity117 , while undeniably tragic for the victims , are not a national catastrophe of the scale of 9/11 , which was carried out by a large , well - organized terrorist group .			0

authors : much of what we thought we knew about @entity117 bombing was wrong
no evidence @entity11 plotted the crime with overseas terrorists , they say
the bombs apparently were *homemade* , based on *information* found *online*
