have you heard about @entity2 's banana slip ? a few days ago in @entity8 , as @entity4 wrapped up his tenure as @entity7 ambassador to @entity2 , he was lambasted in a @entity10 state media editorial			1
the piece called @entity4 a " guide dog			0
" it said he had stirred an " evil wind			0
" worst of all , it called him a " banana			0
" as in yellow on the outside and white on the inside			0
it 's a slur , akin to " @entity21 " for african - americans or " coconut " for @entity24 , used by people of a given ethnic group to judge another member of that group for being insufficiently , well , ethnic			2
the point of saying a person of color is " white inside " is to accuse him of being a race traitor , ashamed or in denial of his true heritage			0
in this case , the idea was that @entity4 , though of @entity10 descent , was n't @entity10 enough			2
why ? he could n't speak the language			0
oh , and he apparently did n't do the bidding of @entity2 's leaders , choosing instead to go to @entity44 , work with dissident human rights activists , point out smog levels in @entity8 and generally represent the interests and values of the @entity7			1
that 's what the editorialist meant when he called @entity4 a banana			2
many @entity10 citizens disavowed the slur , calling it an embarrassment			2
but what it revealed was that despite modernization and burgeoning wealth -- or perhaps because of them -- @entity2 still has a fragile identity			0
( and @entity7 still has some advantages			0
) let 's start with the fact that the editorial was published in an organ of state media			1
it got attention because in a country where the government controls the press , editorials are assumed to express the views of top national leaders			0
they may not , in fact			0
it 's quite possible this particular opinion writer was just an individual			0
but in the absence of a free press , who can really tell ? this is the price of propaganda : no one believes what you say , but they believe you meant to say it			0
a second notable aspect of the banana rant was that it completely conflated ethnicity and nationality , and in a particularly @entity10 way			1
the @entity95 are the overwhelmingly dominant ethnic group of @entity2 , and their ethnocentrism frames @entity10 political culture			1
) it also fuels the nationalism behind @entity2 's territorial disputes with @entity103 and other @entity105 nations			2
so the premise of the banana comment was that someone of @entity10 ethnicity , wherever he may live , should be considered @entity10 to the core and therefore in the end loyal to the @entity10 nation			1
of course , that 's a notion white @entity7 have often used to justify mistreatment of " indelibly alien " @entity10 immigrants , whether during the era of @entity10 exclusion in the late 19th century or the persecution of @entity119 at the turn of this one			1
but it 's as wrong now as then and as wrong here as there			0
even if @entity4 could speak perfect @entity132 , even if he could read the @entity10 classics and write calligraphy , this @entity124 , child of public housing , prosecutor , state legislator , governor , cabinet secretary and diplomat was made in @entity7			1
whether @entity4 is " @entity10 enough " is for him and his family to judge , not for any other @entity10 , much less an apparatchik in @entity2			1
but there can be no doubt that @entity4 is plenty @entity7 , and that 's really what stuck in the craw of some commentators in @entity2			1
ultimately , the banana rant reminds us that the @entity7 , for all its manifest failings and its continuing racial tensions , remains exceptional in its capacity to synthesize the peoples of the world into new hybrids			2
which is also why the @entity7 , for all its economic troubles and relative geopolitical decline , retains a competitive edge over rising powers like @entity2			1
to put it very simply : @entity7 makes @entity10 , but @entity2 does not -- and does not particularly want to -- make @entity7 @entity10			1
it 's in @entity7 's operating system to welcome an immigrant who becomes a houseboy and to make it possible for that immigrant 's grandson to hold high public office			1
this is the @entity4 family arc : truly @entity7			0
it 's not so much in @entity2 's operating system to welcome an immigrant -- whether ethnic @entity10 or not , however steeped in @entity10 civilization -- and make it possible for her family to be seen as truly @entity10			1
when operatives in @entity2 call @entity4 a banana , they assume , wrongly , that to be @entity7 is to be white			1
@entity7 is not white anymore			0
@entity2 may be four times more populous than @entity7			1
but @entity7 is many times more diverse , intermingled , open and adaptive than @entity2			2
i 'm proud to be @entity10 @entity7 : proficient in @entity10 culture , fluent in @entity7 life			2
call me what you will ; i like my country 's chances .			0

a @entity10 state media outlet *referred* to @entity7 ambassador as a " banana "
@entity187 says use of an ethnic slur *reflects* anger at his *performance*
he says @entity2 has a different *concept* of ethnicity than @entity7
*liu* : @entity7 's openness to immigrants is a *big* advantage over @entity2
