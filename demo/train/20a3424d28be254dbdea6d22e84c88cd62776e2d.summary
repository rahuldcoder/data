-- it 's no secret that @entity3 president @entity2 is not a fan of the @entity6 government , and at the @entity7 he took his complaints to a wider audience , calling for action against the @entity12 administration			1
" i want to propose ... that we think seriously about constituting a ' @entity14 ' with international bodies and the large defenders of human rights to begin a lawsuit against the @entity12 government , " he said on tuesday			2
earlier this month , the @entity3 president said his country would accuse the @entity6 of crimes against humanity in the international courts			1
his statements might be written off as bluster , but it nonetheless was a strong critique of the @entity6 on an important stage			2
in a way , @entity29 is continuing a tradition of bombastic barbs before the @entity33 by a number of @entity36 countries with leftist governments			1
it was at the same podium that the late @entity41 president @entity40 , in 2006 , called @entity42 the devil and that behind the microphone " it smells of sulfur still			0
" @entity40 's message seven years ago was that @entity42 acted " as if he owned the world			0
" @entity29 has a similar complaint , targeting @entity12			2
the @entity6 practices " aerial piracy " by denying use of its airspace or limiting the number of visas it grants to delegations from countries it does n't like , @entity29 told @entity0 en @entity62 ol thursday			1

" they blackmail us with visas			0
" the @entity6 will deny use of its airspace to some , and then lie about it , @entity29 said , referring to allegations by the @entity41 government that its president , @entity71 , was blocked from flying over @entity6 airspace last week			2
the @entity41 president saw the incident as an affront , but @entity6 officials said the issue was resolved satisfactorily			2
to @entity29 , @entity12 's government talks about democracy but acts like a hegemon , asserting dominance around the world			1
" first , he talks about peace , we know he is a @entity86 recipient , but he does not contribute to peace , " @entity29 said			0
earlier the week , when @entity12 addressed the assembly , his focus was on @entity90 and the @entity91 and far from @entity36			1
he did touch , however , on the criticisms lobbied against the @entity6 for intervening in other countries ' affairs , especially in the @entity91			1
" the @entity6 is chastised for meddling in the region , and accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy , " he said			0
" at the same time , the @entity6 is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region 's problems , and for showing indifference toward suffering @entity103 populations			1
" @entity29 attended the @entity33 meeting in @entity105 , but @entity71 did not , alleging that there were plots against him			0
because @entity71 and other presidents do not feel safe meeting in @entity105 , @entity29 suggested that the @entity7 rotate to other countries			0
he suggested @entity111 or @entity112 .			0
