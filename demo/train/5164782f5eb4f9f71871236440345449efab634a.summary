-- it may not be comparable to @entity2 , but the plight of the 74 members of the @entity5 , aboard a research ship stuck in ice for more than a week at the bottom of the world , appeared anything but grim as 2014 approached			1
" we 're the @entity14 who have traveled far , having fun doing science in @entity18 ! " a dozen or so of them sang on a video posted on @entity20			1
" lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice ! " the rhyme scheme then fell apart , but the festive mood did not : " really good food and company , but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! ice cold , cha cha cha ! " it was not all fun and games aboard the @entity37 - flagged @entity36			1
after bad weather led the crew of the @entity46 icebreaker @entity47 to suspend efforts to reach the expedition monday , less than 10 nautical miles short of its goal , more than two dozen of those aboard the research vessel ventured onto the surrounding ice , locked arms and proceeded to stomp on the snow to mark a spot where a helicopter from the @entity56 icebreaker @entity57 , or @entity58 , can land			1
the helicopter , which can carry 12 people at a time , is expected to take the ship 's 52 passengers -- including the research team and journalists -- to the @entity57			1
the @entity46 icebreaker that tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel will send a barge to pick them up from the @entity57			2
the 22 crew members of the @entity36 will stay aboard , the @entity68 said			1
but the timing of the rescue remained uncertain as weather tuesday remained bad			0
the failed attempt by the @entity46 icebreaker followed one by the @entity57 , which made it to within 6 nautical miles of the trapped vessel when its path was blocked by ice			2
it returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support , said @entity83 , a spokeswoman for the maritime authority			0
the @entity36 has not moved since @entity85			1
@entity86 , an @entity46 professor of climate change at the @entity88 , told @entity0 that there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts , and in the meantime , people are doing what they can to keep busy			0
that includes yoga and @entity99 classes			0
the expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on november 27			0
the second and current leg of the trip started on december 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to @entity107 on january 4			0
the vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg			2
@entity111 said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet ( 3 meters ) thick			0
it was about 100 nautical miles east of the @entity116 base @entity117 , which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity118 , @entity119			2
on christmas morning , the ship sent a satellite distress signal			0
but by @entity123 , those aboard were showing few signs of distress			0
" up in the air , the @entity56 came , flew around once and left again ! " they sang			0
" the @entity116 dropped by , but could n't get near			1
bloody great shame we 're still stuck here ! " @entity0 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			1

some *stranded* on the @entity36 since @entity85 have sent an *upbeat* *message*
@entity20 video : " lots of snow and lots of ice , lots of penguins , which are very , very nice ! "
" the @entity116 dropped by , but could n't get near . bloody great shame we 're still stuck here ! "
