-- world champion @entity1 claimed his fifth pole position in six attempts this season after profiting from a crash - affected qualifying session in @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity9 was outshone by @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 and @entity13 , but had set the fastest time of one minute and 13.556 seconds when @entity14 was halted for more than half an hour after @entity16 rookie @entity15 slid into the barriers of the street circuit			1
@entity10 , the 2008 world champion , had yet to set his flying lap and was unable to do better than seventh following the resumption			0
the @entity22 driver went above @entity24 ' @entity23 -- who crashed at the same place as @entity15 in saturday 's final practice session -- but could lose that spot after running across a chicane in his desperate attempt to move up the grid and attracting the interest of the race stewards			1
the world 's greatest motor race ? @entity15 , who was taken to hospital , is unlikely to race on sunday after suffering concussion and a leg injury , but his @entity39 team said he had escaped serious harm			1
" it was with great relief the team received the news that @entity15 has no serious injuries after his heavy accident in the closing minutes of the final part of qualifying for the @entity8 , " the team said in a statement			1
" the reason for the accident will be investigated and the team will update the media as soon as it has any further information			0
" it was the same barrier that @entity39 's @entity54 hit in 1994 , with the @entity56 surviving after going into a coma			0
@entity10 accuses @entity58 of helping @entity59 @entity1 leads the championship standings by 41 points from @entity10 , who is the only man to beat him this season -- in @entity63 last month			2
the @entity59 driver bounced back from his runner - up finish in @entity66 to win in @entity67 and @entity68 , and is now favorite to clinch his first victory in @entity8 if he can avoid any mistakes as front - runner on the notoriously tricky track			0
the 23 - year - old will start ahead of @entity10 's teammate @entity74 , who won at @entity8 on the way to becoming world champion while at @entity77 in 2009			2
the @entity78 clocked a best lap of 1:13.997 to head off 2010 @entity8 winner @entity80 in the second @entity59 ( 1:14.019 ) while final practice pacesetter @entity81 of @entity83 was fourth in 1:14.483			0
seven - time world champion @entity84 was fifth in 1:14.682 , with the @entity9 hoping to equal @entity86 's record of six victories in the principality despite another disappointing season so far for @entity24			0
@entity90 will start sixth for @entity83 , while @entity93 ' @entity92 rookie @entity91 was ninth ahead of the non-finishing @entity15			2
it was a disappointing day for @entity95 , who lost a naming - rights law battle with @entity98 on friday and then saw @entity99 and @entity100 fail to reach @entity14			0
@entity93 ' veteran @entity102 driver @entity101 , four times a runner - up in @entity8 , will start 11th behind @entity104 's @entity99 if @entity15 can not take to the wheel .			1
