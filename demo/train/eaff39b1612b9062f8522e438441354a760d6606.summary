-- @entity1 fought back after @entity2 's 99th international century to claim an unlikely three - wicket win over @entity5 co-hosts @entity6 saturday			1
@entity6 looked set to run up a massive score in @entity8 but after @entity2 went for 111 they lost their last nine wickets for just 29 to be bowled out for 296			1
paceman @entity11 did the damage with a brilliant five - wicket burst but it was still a tough total to chase on a slow pitch			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 all scored half centuries to keep them in the hunt before @entity21 and @entity22 plundered late runs			0
but 13 were still needed off the final over by seamer @entity25 with @entity26 on strike and @entity21 at the other end			0
only four balls were needed as @entity26 hit a four , a massive six and then two runs to pull the scores level			1
a boundary through the covers clinched victory and left the @entity35 , who still top @entity37 , crestfallen			0
earlier , @entity2 and @entity38 put on 142 in just 17.4 overs in an explosive opening stand			0
@entity41 ( 69 ) joined @entity2 in another century partnership and a score well in excess of 300 looked on the cards			0
but @entity11 , who was named man - of - the - match for his inspired spell , turned the game his side 's way after their disappointing defeat to @entity52 in their previous match			2
@entity2 has scored 48 one - day international tons to add to his record 51 test match centuries			1
meanwhile , @entity52 off - spinner @entity57 has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee for his conduct in his side 's shock @entity5 defeat to @entity63 friday			2
@entity57 was openly furious that the night - time dew at the @entity65 made it difficult for him to grip the ball .			0

@entity1 beat co-hosts @entity6 in @entity5 *cricket* match in @entity8
@entity26 strikes winning runs in three - wicket victory
@entity2 scores 48th one - day international ton for @entity6
