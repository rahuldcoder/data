@entity0 , @entity1 's daughter , recently speculated on where her father might stand on same - sex marriage			1
@entity4 published her thoughts under the headline , " @entity0 says @entity1 would n't have opposed gay marriage			1
" the impact of the article was immediate			0
a quick @entity11 search yielded multiple follow - up articles and blog posts			2
liberals nationwide were off and running with a new same - sex marriage endorsement : this one from @entity1 , the conservative 's conservative			1
this is not the first time liberals have rushed to recast @entity1 according to their policy preferences			2
immediately after his death in june 2004 , he was trotted out as a poster - boy for embryonic stem - cell research			2
please , not so fast			0
in @entity27 ' defense , she starts with a crucial point about her father , one liberals had utterly refused while the man was alive : " he was a very tolerant person			0
" indeed , @entity1 was tolerant -- on religion , on race , on ethnic differences , on differences of opinion on many things , and also toward gays			1
as @entity27 notes , " he did not have prejudices against gay people			0
" @entity27 gives just a few of many examples			0
but she then goes where i do n't think we should			0
she states of her father and same - sex marriage : " i do n't think he would stand in the way of it , at all			1
i do n't think he would stand in the way of two people wanting to make a commitment to one another			0
" @entity55 lawmakers approve same - sex marriage bill @entity27 then uses an argument that is libertarian ( which @entity1 was not ) , and which fails to understand the essence of conservatives ' objection to same - sex marriage : " i also think because he wanted government out of peoples ' lives , he would not understand the intrusion of government banning such a thing			1
this is not what he would have thought government should be doing			0
" the problem with that statement , applied to the same - sex marriage debate , is this : conservatives object to the federal government rendering unto itself the unprecedented ability to redefine marriage			1
such is a massive step toward government intervention ( one that should worry libertarians ) , toward powerful government , toward big government -- not restrained and limited government			0
it is a step that breaks entirely new ground in not only @entity90 history but human history , one with unimaginable and extraordinary effects yet to come on the family , the culture , the economy , government services and ( among others ) the court system			0
the essence of conservatism is to preserve and conserve time - tested values that have endured for good reason and for the best of society and for order			0
conservatives -- which is what @entity1 was -- aim to conserve			2
by their nature and definition , conservatives do not rush into radical changes or what they fear may be another fad or fashion or popular demand			0
they also , by their definition , ground their ideals in both natural law and biblical law			0
i know that secular liberals do n't want to hear religious arguments against same - sex marriage , but , if we 're talking about @entity1 ( and conservatives ) , we can not exclude them			1
@entity126 : same - sex marriage has n't won ( yet ... ) contrary to the image of him as president , @entity1 was very religious and would not have so easily consented to a culture suddenly demanding the right to redefine what the scriptures ( @entity133 and @entity134 ) say clearly about a man and a woman leaving their parents and coming together to form one flesh in marriage			1
@entity1 's religious roots were deep , inculcated by his mother , an extremely devout , traditional @entity144 , and others who profoundly influenced him in @entity146 , @entity147 , in the 1920s			1
he said that " everything " he learned about the values that shaped his life and presidency he learned back in @entity146			0
it was his " inheritance , " one that never left him			0
needless to say , @entity1 did not learn to support same - sex marriage in @entity146			1
moreover , @entity1 was unwavering in his conviction of the importance of a father and a mother raising children and the next generation of @entity90 citizens and understood marriage as a vital bond between a man and a woman			1
to cite just one example from the final days of his presidency ( january 12 , 1989 ) , @entity1 insisted that " we must teach youngsters the beauty of the loving , lifelong relationship between husband and wife that is marriage			1
" yes , @entity1 was tolerant of gay people -- as is everyone i know who opposes same - sex marriage -- but that in no way means he would have advocated redefining marriage			1
toleration of something certainly does not automatically translate into advocating its legalization			0
we could list innumerable things that we tolerate -- including from friends and family and loved ones -- but would n't argue legalizing			0
even then , that 's not quite the issue			0
the issue , after all , is n't whether homosexuality should be legal ( no one objects to that ) but whether marriage will now begin a long process of continual redefinition			0
it 's a form of intellectual laziness for liberals / progressives to reflexively assume that anyone who disagrees with them on redefining marriage is a recalcitrant bigot with no possible legitimate reasons			2
after all , same - sex marriage opponents are adhering to the prevailing definition of marriage according to its literal and ancient roots ; they believe in the cross-cultural norm that humanity has adhered to since the dawn of humanity , to a human understanding as old as the @entity215			1
it 's remarkably short - sighted to dismiss them as hopeless bigots			2
that brings me back to @entity1			2
it 's funny , people on the political left spent eight years calling @entity1 a bigot			1
when liberals were n't denouncing him as an unregenerate racist -- the single most unfair charge unceasingly flung at @entity1 -- they were saying that he did n't like gay people and did nothing about @entity230 because he was happy to let gays die			2
@entity27 remembers this well , as she does the vicious accusation that her father was a nuclear warmonger			0
to say that liberals were unhinged in their nastiness to @entity1 is insufficient			2
now , in his death , they 'd like to remold him in their own image , crowning him a poster boy for same - sex marriage			1
the simple truth is that @entity1 was a committed and principled conservative who had thoughtful and firmly grounded reasons for his positions			2
that , too , ironically , is a fact that liberals ignored , caricaturing @entity1 as an idiot , a simpleton , an " amiable dunce , " as @entity255 famously called him			2
he would not have merrily hopped on the same - sex marriage bandwagon without first carefully considering how the issue fit with his understanding of the laws of nature and nature 's @entity262 , of the first things and first principles that conservatives of @entity1 's generation spent years discussing at great length in their books and publications and conferences			1
could we at least agree on this much ? @entity1 was silent on same - sex marriage , as was everyone of his generation			1
he , like all liberals of his time , could not have conceived of same - sex marriage , and he , like the entirety of the @entity281 just a decade or two ago , unwaveringly supported traditional marriage			1
let 's leave it at that .			0

@entity287 : @entity0 says her father would have backed same - sex marriage
he says there 's no evidence @entity1 would have supported *rethinking* of marriage
@entity287 says @entity1 opposed prejudice against gays but was profoundly conservative
he says @entity1 would have considered it but would have been *reluctant* to change
