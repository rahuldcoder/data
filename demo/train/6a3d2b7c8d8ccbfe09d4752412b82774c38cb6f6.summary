-- perhaps they 're not the first place you think of when it comes to wineries , but these four regions offer character and great wine , without the hoopla			1
@entity10 is set high on the bluffs overlooking the @entity12			2
@entity13 , @entity14 in the mid- 90s when oenophiles started to buzz about the region 's @entity18 - style wines , there were 10 wineries in @entity13			1
today , there are more than 100 , mostly accessible from @entity22			1
with wine comes food , and gourmands like @entity26 and @entity27 have been pouring into town in the past decade			1
two years ago , @entity26 and @entity27 left their jobs as owner and chef , respectively , of an @entity34 restaurant in @entity35 , @entity14 , to open the @entity36 in the heart of @entity13			1
each of the four guest rooms at their renovated @entity41 - style bungalow has a fireplace and a large tiled bathroom , and @entity27 can pack box lunches of gourmet charcuterie and cheeses , sandwiches , fruit , and dessert for picnics ( @entity51 , rooms from $ 125 , lunch $ 13 )			0
@entity26 recommends enjoying them on the outdoor patio near the bocce ball courts at @entity56 , west of town on @entity22 ( @entity59 , tasting $ 5 , refundable with wine bottle purchase )			2
@entity0 : see the four unexpected wine trails the highway takes you back toward downtown @entity13 , a preserved 19th - century @entity64 town , where food options range from a burrito stuffed with beef , cheese , and local sweet onions at the @entity71 truck ( 509/522 - 2866 , $ 5 ) , to @entity73 flatbread wrapped around spiced lamb and topped with yogurt sauce at @entity76 , whose chef was recently a semifinalist for a @entity80 ( @entity81 , $ 13 )			1
highway 12 continues east toward @entity83 , a converted farm shed with a capital @entity85 painted on its front and a 12 - foot cement statue of the letter by the entrance			0
here , former band manager @entity90 blasts music by the @entity92 and the @entity93 -- both personal friends -- and serves his signature @entity95 in honor of his favorite toast : que sera ( @entity99 , tastings free , by appointment )			2
-- @entity101 @entity102 , @entity103 twisting from @entity104 , @entity103 , to the @entity105 , a 16 - mile portion of @entity107 passes through the organic apple orchards , olive groves , and redwood forests of @entity102			1
some of the more than 20 vineyards along the way supply pinot noir grapes for famous wineries in @entity115 and @entity116 , but you can taste similar vintages at the farm - style @entity102 wineries -- minus the popped - collar crowds			1
@entity122 lets babydoll sheep ( too petite to reach the fruit ) graze under the vines , and free - range chickens wander the vineyards to help keep pests under control			1
@entity131 tours of the grounds and tastings of the star wines -- pinot noir and dry @entity137 - style whites -- are both free ( navarrovineyards.com )			1
about 10 miles northwest along the highway , gewürztraminer grapes thrive in the rich soil and foggy mornings at @entity142			0
longtime owners of @entity116 's @entity144 and @entity10 , @entity145 and @entity146 , acquired the rural estate last year ( @entity148 , tastings free )			1
nearby , @entity149 -- the oldest in the valley , and owned by the @entity152 family -- has 10 picnic tables : some in the sun , some sheltered under vine - covered pergolas			0
past an arch of roses , the family pours complimentary samples of sauvignon blanc and pinot noir in a century - old redwood tasting room ( huschvineyards.com )			0
like their neighbors to the north , @entity167 and @entity168 also run a vineyard and farm at @entity171 in @entity172 ( a separate wine region in the @entity102 )			1
each of the two huge suites in their 6,000 - square - foot @entity178 @entity177 - style inn comes with a queen - size bed , a separate sitting room with a daybed and trundle , a full bath , and mountain views ( @entity185 , $ 150 )			0
along the route , you can stop for one of 60 varieties of apples at @entity192 's @entity191 , on an orchard just north of @entity194 ( 707/895 - 3353 )			2
-- @entity101 between @entity195 and @entity196 , @entity12 what the @entity197 ( hermannwinetrail.com ) lacks in size -- there are only six wineries along the 20 - mile stretch -- it makes up for in experience			2
the region has been producing vintages since the 1840s , before @entity115 had produced a single bottle			0
the captain @entity208 makes an ideal home base -- and not just because it 's in the center of @entity195 's adorable historic district			2
the breakfasts of upside - down apple @entity178 toast , three - cheese quiche , or baked eggs with turkey bacon and herbs are exactly what you need to prepare you for a day of sampling wines ( @entity223 , from $ 75 )			0
less than a mile away , the family - run @entity224 gives free tastings in the estate 's original stone house with wood - beamed ceilings			1
for many of the 16 - 18 wines , you 'll get a bite of something to help you identify the flavors			0
a key - lime shortbread cookie brings out the fruit flavors in the vignoles , a sweet white wine , and a piece of chocolate softens the tannins in the dry @entity242 ( adampuchtawine.com )			2
the picnic tables on the grounds make the perfect lunch spot , so on the way to the winery , stop at husband - and - wife - owned @entity248 to pick up some bratwurst sandwiches and one of the 15 kinds of homemade pie ( @entity254 , pie $ 3 per slice )			0
two and a half miles down the road , @entity10 is set high on the bluffs overlooking the @entity12 -- one can imagine that the terrain reminded @entity259 settlers of their native @entity261 valley			0
tours of the 162 - year - old arched cellars , where wine is still stored , end in the tasting room , where you can try the chardonel , a dry , buttery white that 's similar to a chardonnay , and the limited - edition vintage port			1
next to the tasting room , @entity273 's original stable is now @entity275 , where the menu ranges from hearty @entity259 specialties like schnitzel to more refined entrées like filet mignon ( @entity281 , tours $ 2.50 , tastings free )			1
@entity283 @entity284 , @entity285 @entity285 's premier wine country , dotted with working farms and over 1,000 acres of grape vines , spreads out around the city of @entity284 in the foothills of the @entity291			1
the free tour at 20 - acre @entity293 both explores the winery and recounts the history of @entity285 wine making ( @entity297 , tasting $ 5 )			1
the viognier , with aromas of honeysuckle and apricot , is an ideal refresher , and from the deck at the tasting room , visitors have a view of @entity307 and @entity309 's home , @entity310 , a mile and a half north , where a recently opened visitors center introduces guests to the founding father 's life and ideas ( @entity317 , from $ 15 )			2
@entity309 's master builder also built @entity319 , a b&b just a block from the @entity322			2
the decor deliberately recalls the colonial era , but the amenities -- @entity326 and flat - screen tvs -- are right up - to - date ( @entity328 , from $ 109 )			0
@entity329 of @entity310 is @entity330 and @entity331 , whose @entity332 has hints of candied apple and lemon custard ( @entity337 , tasting $ 10 )			0
about 18 miles west of @entity284 , in @entity339 , @entity338 occupies 15 acres on a farm where polo ponies are raised ; visitors can watch polo matches for free on sundays from @entity344 through the end of september ( @entity346 , tasting $ 5 )			1
for a picnic at the vineyard , the @entity349 , a dry rosé , pairs well with the tomato sauce on a pie from perennial favorite @entity354			0
be prepared for a wait at the 32 - year - old institution ; some call this the best pizza in the state , and people come from miles around to combine toppings from the list of over 30 options , including zucchini , peanuts , and bacon ( crozetpizza.net , from $ 11.50 )			0
