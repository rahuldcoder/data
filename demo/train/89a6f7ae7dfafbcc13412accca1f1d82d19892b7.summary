@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's president saturday vowed to sign sweeping anti-gay legislation , citing what he said were scientific , not political , considerations for a controversial measure in a country that already criminalizes homosexuality			1
in a statement , president @entity10 declared debate on the legislation over and said he was not concerned about the expected international outcry			1
his remarks , made during a conference of the ruling @entity17 , drew loud applause from supporters			0
" we shall have a war with the homosexual lobby in the world , but backed by these people ( scientists ) and you , " he told supporters			1
a @entity1 lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts			1
it was briefly shelved when @entity32 and other @entity34 nations threatened to withdraw aid to @entity1 , which relies on millions of dollars from the international community			1
the nation 's parliament passed the bill in december , supplanting the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for " aggravated homosexuality			2
" it includes acts where one person is infected with @entity48 , " serial offenders " and sex with minors , @entity45 said			0
in cases where one has @entity48 , the punishment applies even when the sex is consensual or protected			0
@entity10 said that scientists examining the issue determined there was no gene for homosexuality and that it was merely abnormal behavior			1
he said in a statement that he sought " a scientific ... not a political answer			0
let the scientists answer this			0
and according to the way they have answered it , if they mislead us , they are the ones who are responsible			0
" he said , " the question i put to them was , are there people born like this ? now they are saying they are no such people			0
" according to @entity45 , the bill 's definition of " aggravated homosexuality " includes acts in which a person is infected with @entity48 , " serial offenders " and sex with minors			2
the bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians , a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity101 countries , where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism			0
according to @entity45 , homosexuality is illegal in 38 of 54 @entity101 countries			0
in @entity1 , homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison , according to rights activists			1
but lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation , saying the influence of @entity115 lifestyles risks destroying family units			2
homosexuality is taboo in @entity101 countries and activists say few @entity101 are openly gay , fearing imprisonment , violence and loss of their jobs			0
@entity10 appears to be balancing the desire to please a conservative constituency vehemently opposed to homosexuality with hopes of not alienating @entity115 aid donors to the east @entity101 country			2
last month , he declined to sign the bill , but the move was not designed to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians			2
@entity10 believed that @entity135 illegally passed the bill , and gays and lesbians are " sick people who need help , " his spokesman said at the time			1
the president had sent a letter to the speaker of @entity135 , saying that he could n't sign the bill because there were n't enough @entity135 members present when it was passed			2
they are sick , " spokesman @entity148 said , explaining the president 's thinking			0
" homosexuals were present in @entity101 in the past and were not persecuted			0
" at the ruling party conference this week , however , @entity10 said he was persuaded of the need to sign the bill by his scientific advisers , who cited , among other reasons , the " serious public health consequences " of homosexuality			1
where last month , the president , through his spokesman , seemed to perceive homosexuality as an illness , now @entity10 seemed to be following the lead of a government committee that declared friday that homosexuality is " not a disease but merely an abnormal behavior which may be learned through experiences in life			1
" in a statement , the @entity173 - based @entity172 said the bill would " place the lives of countless @entity1 at risk " and " had already intensified the climate of hatred and persecution " against gay people in @entity1			1
" the international community has a legal and moral obligation to prevent this law from being implemented , " the center said .			0
