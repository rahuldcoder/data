@entity0 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			0
one final 2014 showdown and several examples of post-election fallout filled a trip around the " @entity11 " table that -- surprise -- included one note of possible bipartisan compromise			0
the battle of the bayou appears one - sided the december 6 @entity17 runoff is the last 2014 showdown and , at least so far , it appears to be a lopsided affair			1
@entity21 rep. @entity20 leads in the polls , and even most democrats assign little or no hope to their incumbent , sen. @entity25			1
the @entity27 's @entity26 noted how both candidates are using the " lame - duck " @entity29 to highlight their support for the @entity32			2
and she noted some details -- " facts on the ground " a good military analyst might say -- that suggest @entity20 has a huge advantage			1
" @entity39 candidate who came in third endorsed @entity20 , ( @entity25 is ) thought to be down by double digits and 90 % of the advertising on the @entity43 air waves is in favor of @entity20 , " said @entity26			1
" so unless we see a big change in the dynamic in the @entity43 race as a result of the @entity32 vote , @entity25 has a real tough fight			2
leader @entity52 tries to help a friend , and irks some colleagues many long - serving @entity55 @entity23 are lamenting at least two more years in the minority -- which means a lot less power and fewer perks			1
so being a " ranking member " -- the top @entity61 -- on a committee is , for the moment , the top prize available			0
normally , seniority and past committee service are the criteria for these titles , but sometimes there are competitions , and in that case who you know can matter			0
@entity72 of the @entity73 took us inside one such battle , in which @entity52 has a starring role			1
" there 's sort of a proxy battle for the top @entity23 job on the @entity82 , " said @entity72			1
" it pits @entity85 democrat @entity84 , who has seniority , against @entity88 democrat @entity87 , who 's a very good friend of @entity52			1
she 's been actively campaigning for @entity87 , twisting some arms , refusing to allow people to vote by proxy from a distance if they 're unable to be here , generating a lot of bad blood and a few different rank - and - file members said this is just a little too high school for them			2
wait , there might actually be some @entity101 dealmaking ? @entity102 of the @entity103 shared reporting that president @entity101 is prepared to make a deal , so that he wins @entity17 confirmation for a number of administration appointees			1
the goal : votes to get ambassadors and other appointees on the job , eliminating vacancies the @entity55 says have undermined government performance			0
the price : @entity102 reports that to get enough senators in both parties to sign off on the package , the president is prepared to withdraw several controversial nominees			1
" president @entity101 has a lot of nominations still sitting there , languishing on @entity124 , " said @entity102			1
" he 's working with @entity125 and @entity126 to get a package deal through , pushing a bunch through , mostly career ambassadors , and tossing over to the side some of the more controversial ones , like nominee for surgeon general and that guy who wants to be ambassador to @entity136 , which is never busy			1
talk of undusting @entity101 's veto pen a good deal of post-election analysis has raised the prospect of president @entity101 wielding his veto power more now that @entity21 control both chambers of @entity29			1
but will that happen ? will the @entity21 , for example , be able to get enough votes in the @entity17 to join the @entity55 in voting to repeal @entity146 ? or to pass anything big for that matter ? @entity150 's @entity149 suggested there might be a lot more talk about vetoes than actual use of the veto pen			1
" he 's only used it twice in his entire presidency , " said @entity157			2
" the first big test is coming up this week with the @entity32 pipeline vote			0
the word is there are 59 votes and some optimism that maybe they 'll get to 60 but maybe not			0
my question is how soon will he really have to use that veto pen and how frequently , given the close balance in the @entity17			2
in @entity173 , a big @entity21 win sparks a @entity21 fight @entity173 @entity21 lost races for governor and @entity177 this midterm year , but are celebrating their success in retaking control of the @entity182 chamber			0
well , celebrating and fighting at the same time			0
a former @entity21 speaker , @entity183 , wants his old job back			0
but an array of @entity21 establishment figures are pushing an alternative candidate , arguing @entity183 is too conservative and , in their view , likely to hurt the @entity21 's image by pushing policies backed by the tea party and social conservatives			2
among those trying to block @entity183 : former gov. @entity195 , former state @entity21 chairman @entity196 and @entity198 sen. @entity198			0
the buzz in @entity200 is about how rare it is for a @entity203 senator to meddle in state legislative business			0
but those close to @entity198 say she and the others involved see this as a tea party vs. establishment battle they must fight			2
@entity198 is up for re-election in 2016 , a presidential year in which the electorate tends to be more favorable to @entity23			0
so @entity198 does not want two years of home state political debate about whether the @entity173 @entity21 is too extreme			0
especially because the new @entity55 speaker would be regularly engaged in debates with @entity23 gov. @entity218 -- who just won re-election and is the early choice of many state democrats as their best @entity198 challenger .			0

90 % of advertising in the @entity17 race is in favor of @entity20
testing @entity52 's power in a @entity82 leadership battle
@entity101 possibly *jettisoning* more controversial picks to get a nominees deal
