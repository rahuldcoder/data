-- new parents , particularly mothers , devote so much time and energy to their children that they often fail to adequately look after their own health , a new study in the journal @entity8 suggests			1
the study , which followed about 1,500 high school students into their mid- 20s , found that those who became parents got far less exercise than their childless peers			1
for moms , the news gets worse : unlike fathers , mothers tended to have a higher body mass index ( @entity18 ) and less healthy diets than women of the same age without kids			1
the mothers in the study averaged about 400 calories more per day than other women			1
they also consumed more saturated fat , ate fewer green vegetables like broccoli and spinach , and drank nearly twice the amount of soda , sports drinks , and other sugary beverages			0
the researchers found no such differences among men			0
@entity0 : 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day mothers , who are usually the primary caregivers in a household , may have little time to prepare healthy meals for themselves in addition to what they fix for their children , and so they may be apt to fall back on quick - and - easy processed foods such as macaroni and cheese , says @entity51 , @entity52 , the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of family medicine and community health at the @entity57 , in @entity58			1
" moms might be having multiple time demands and have to sacrifice making healthier meals , " she says			2
" they cook high - fat , more palatable foods because they do n't have time to do otherwise			1
" that 's not to say they 're dining only on junk food , @entity65 adds			0
mothers ate just as much fruit , whole grains , calcium , and fiber as their childless counterparts			2
" we found that they are trying [ to eat healthy ] , " @entity65 says , " but they are not able to do it all the time			1
" @entity0 : easy meals for families the study participants were an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group who were 25 years old , on average			2
( to further limit the influence of economic and cultural factors , the researchers controlled for income and race			0
) roughly 10 percent were parents , most with just one child who was a year old or younger			0
" it 's a wide enough population to represent what is really happening , " says @entity93 , @entity94 , a family physician at @entity95 , in @entity96			0
when it comes to exercise , raising kids appears to cut into workout time for both parents			1
each week , moms and dads lost about 60 and 90 minutes of physical activity , respectively , compared to other young adults			0
for the mothers , less exercise and less - healthy diets added up to a higher @entity18 , a ratio of height to weight used to estimate body fat			1
the average @entity18 was one point higher among moms than among childless women , whereas fatherhood appeared to have no association with @entity18			1
@entity0 : 7 steps to instant calm @entity93 , who was not involved with the research , says the findings reinforce what she tells the many young parents and parents - to - be whom she sees in her practice			2
" i talk to them about cleaning up their act , " she says			0
" it 's a conversation that i have early and often			0
" getting through to them before the baby arrives is especially important , @entity93 says , because after that they 'll need all the stamina that a good diet and lots of exercise can give them			2
" when they have a newborn , they are sleep deprived and no message will get through , " she says			0
the months after becoming a parent are indeed a " high - risk time " for young adults , @entity65 adds			2
" it 's a new phase of life , they 're learning to be parents , and there 's a trade - off between parenting and taking care of themselves that they need to be able to balance			0
