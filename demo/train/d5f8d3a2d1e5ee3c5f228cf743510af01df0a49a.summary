-- it 's one of the more disturbing revelations to arise from an investigation into fatal delays in care at @entity7 medical centers : employee bonuses appear to be one factor behind the manipulation of patient wait times in at least one hospital			2
two reports released this week -- one by the @entity15 's inspector general and another by the secretary of the @entity7 -- indicate in some cases wait times were manipulated to meet employee performance goals needed for bonuses			1
the news has raised questions about just how widespread the practice was and who received the financial incentives			0
answers from the @entity15 have been harder to come by			0
here 's a look at what we know : what did the reports reveal ? at the @entity15 patient wait times were directly tied to @entity15 employees ' bonuses and raises			2
by manipulating doctor 's appointments for the veterans , the wait time to see a doctor appeared to be shorter , a factor considered in @entity15 employee bonuses and raises , according to a @entity15 inspector general report said			1
the @entity15 secretary 's audit of a number of medical centers that concluded " some front - line , middle , and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate " the scheduling process to meet performance goals established by the agency			1
who benefited ? by all indications , from the reports and congressional testimony , the practice involved high - level managers in at least the @entity15 medical network			1
neither report identified managers by name or position			2
how much money ? there is no easy answer to this			0
performance incentives are typically tied to a number of factors , and the @entity15 has not detailed how much of a role patient wait times may have played			0
who knew about it ? there is no hard and fast answer			0
the first public revelation that salary increases and bonuses may have been a factor came with the release of the agency 's inspector general report			1
the @entity84 also asked the question during a combative hearing this week , where rep. @entity87 , @entity88 , inquired whether there was a financial motivation to manipulate appointment schedules at the @entity15			0
" that is a discussion the ( @entity15 inspector general ) is having , " dr. @entity92 , the @entity15 's assistant deputy undersecretary for clinical operations , said			1
how widespread is the problem ? it appears the @entity15 , itself , is still trying to answer that question , citing the ongoing inspector general 's investigation			1
a final report is due in august			0
the issue of patient wait times is not an overall performance factor ordered by the @entity15 , @entity92 recently told the @entity84			1
the factors tied to bonuses and raises are decided by each @entity15 network , @entity92 said			0
but the @entity15 also appeared to indicate in its audit that its mandate to improve wait times may have played a role			0
as a result of the audit , the @entity15 suspended financial incentives -- bonuses and salary increases -- for all @entity119 executives for the 2014 fiscal year .			2

a *preliminary* @entity15 inspector general report reveals bonuses may have been a factor
a @entity15 audit concludes managers felt compelled to manipulate the process
the reason , according to the audit , was to meet performance goals
the @entity15 has not identified who got bonuses or how much money was involved
