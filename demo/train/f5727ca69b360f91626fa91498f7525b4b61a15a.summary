@entity0 -- president @entity2 arrives in @entity3 this weekend for his first official campaign visit to the battleground state of @entity6 , a hyped rally that is mobilizing both @entity9 and @entity10 ground troops for the general election			1
but the fight for @entity6 begins in earnest wednesday in the @entity0 suburb of @entity14 , a warren of office parks and shopping malls near @entity18 and just 10 miles from where the first major battle of the @entity20 unfolded			1
@entity21 will campaign at a @entity14 trade show facility and begin his quest to reverse @entity2 's history - making win in 2008 , when he became the first @entity25 to carry the state on the presidential level since @entity28 did so in his landslide 1964 election			1
the densely populated suburban swath outside @entity0 is hardly the only piece of the @entity6 political puzzle -- the @entity3 metro area and @entity35 in the southeast are also critical -- but because of the number of voters and their swingy tendencies , northern @entity6 is guaranteed to be showered with attention from the presidential campaigns			1
it 's a fitting place for @entity21 to introduce himself to @entity43			2
@entity14 straddles two huge counties , @entity45 and @entity46 , that both voted for @entity2 in 2008			2
one out of eight @entity43 lives in @entity45 , and @entity2 won the county in blowout fashion over sen. @entity50 of @entity51 , taking 60 % of the vote there			2
but the next november , voters in @entity45 , @entity46 and prince @entity56 counties swung back hard to @entity57 , the state 's @entity9 governor			1
@entity57 called the @entity0 suburbs , heavy with small business owners and contractors for government agencies and the military , " tremendously important " for @entity21			1
" you 've got a million people in @entity45 alone , " he said			0
" you 've got a couple million in those ring counties			0
republicans must do well and at least break even up there to win			0
you ca n't get blown out there , as has happened in a couple past elections			0
" @entity57 , a social conservative who won his race with a relentless focus on jobs and the economy , described northern @entity6 as " the biggest collection of independent voters who are fiscal conservative			1
" " they will vote the issues , " he said			0
" they will vote the person			0
@entity21 has got to spent a fair amount of time there			2
" until @entity57 's victory , the region had been trending @entity10 in statewide elections for years			0
@entity2 , for instance , won @entity45 by 109,000 votes			2
in the 2006 @entity96 race , @entity94 won it by 64,000 votes over @entity99			0
@entity100 won it by a similar margin to capture the governor 's mansion in 2005			1
and @entity107 , despite losing the state to @entity106 in 2004 , won @entity45 by 33,700 votes			0
but strategists for both parties say that voters are more fickle than recent election results let on			0
" those voters are far more independent than people give them credit for , " said @entity113 , a co-chairman of @entity50 's 2008 campaign in @entity6			1
" it 's the great , classic suburban swing vote			1
it 's where the state legislature has shifted its power			0
it 's a very discerning kind of voter that is closely watching every election			0
" @entity10 admit that in the wake of the 2009 @entity57 wave , the @entity0 area is no gim me			2
" it 's critically important in terms of its size and its swingy - ness , " said one veteran @entity10 operative in the state who declined to be named discussing party strategy			0
" and anyone who thinks of northern @entity6 as a @entity10 bastion just does n't understand the state			0
" the @entity2 campaign won in 2008 , in large part with organization			1
his supporters ventured far outside northern @entity6 to find and register new voters in urban centers and traditionally @entity9 precincts across the state			2
that 's one reason why @entity2 is making his " official " re-election debut on saturday in central @entity6 , where @entity10 began making gains more than a decade ago when @entity155 won the governorship in 2001			1
the president 's rally is at @entity159 in downtown @entity3 , offering him the chance to appeal to his urban base while also tapping into the area 's suburbs			2
at least one senior @entity9 strategist in the state gave @entity2 credit for the choice of venue			1
" it 's a smart location because you 're killing a lot of birds , " said the strategist , who did not want to be identified while complimenting the @entity2 campaign			1
" it 's a major city , a large university with a lot of students , and an area where you 're going to get a lot of earned media in @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 , which are pretty significant sizes			0
" @entity21 is also taking his campaign downstate on thursday , when he will rally with @entity57 in @entity187 , a @entity189 town in the vote - rich @entity35 region along the state 's southeastern coast			1
@entity57 said @entity21 needs to hit as many parts of the state as he can between now and november			0
" it 's very hard for a @entity9 to win the presidency without @entity6 , " he said .			1

both @entity2 and @entity21 will campaign in @entity6 this week
@entity2 took @entity0 suburbs in 2008 but they swung @entity9 in governor 's race
governor says area full of independents who are fiscally conservative
one strategist calls the area " the great , classic suburban swing vote "
