@entity0 -- the @entity2 says it will study the effects of toxic emissions from burning trash at military installations in @entity7 and @entity8 on veterans , even after the @entity10 has concluded no long - term effects exist			1
studies of the smoke from the burn pits suggests it contains dioxin and other toxins			1
the extent of the @entity2 's intention was discussed in a letter to concerned congressmen that was sent on friday and obtained by @entity1			2
in the letter responding to the congressmen 's inquiry on the subject , va secretary @entity23 said he shared " concerns that some veterans could have health problems from such exposures			2
" " our previous experiences with returning @entity35 and @entity36 veterans show that we must take these concerns very seriously , " he added			0
@entity23 said the @entity2 will study the problem as part of an effort to analyze effects of troops ' exposures in general and suggested it might even seek a parallel independent study			2
" we are currently evaluating the need for an independent assessment by nongovernmental scientific experts to help us understand the health effects of various combat exposures , " @entity23 wrote			0
sources familiar with the plan said the @entity2 is finalizing a deal with the government 's @entity53 to conduct the study			1
the @entity53 did a similar investigation of @entity57 and other effects from the first @entity7 war			1
the emissions , from what are known as burn pits , have been a concern for troops , especially those who served at @entity65 in @entity7			1
many soldiers who went through @entity65 became used to " @entity7 crud , " as they dubbed the symptom of excessive coughing and black phlegm			2
soldiers complained of respiratory problems and skin infections , and in some cases believed they developed leukemia and tumors from the exposure			1
the pits at @entity65 were at one point open and burning everything from plastics and food to medical waste , sometimes with jet fuel used as an accelerant			2
in later years , incinerators were installed at @entity65 , but other bases in @entity7 and @entity8 still use the pits without incinerators to burn garbage			1
the military said last year that smoke from the @entity65 pit exposed troops to toxic emissions , including low levels of cancer - causing dioxins			1
however , its tests indicated there is no long - term danger , officials said			1
the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) conducted a study of air samples at @entity65 after concerns were raised about the toxic nature of the pervasive smoke from the incineration pits			1
the air samples were collected between january and april 2007			0
but the report admitted that it can not account for everything burned in the pit			0
an additional 107 samples were collected in october and november 2007			0
the results of those tests will be released early in 2009			0
many in the veterans ' community remain unconvinced that burn pits were harmless			1
a group from @entity122 wrote to the @entity10 and the @entity2 demanding more tests			2
in his response , @entity23 said the veterans department has an ongoing study comparing 30,000 veterans deployed to @entity7 and @entity8 and 30,000 nondeployed veterans			0
it is evaluating " self reported exposures ( including burning trash and feces ) , symptoms , chronic health conditions , functional status , pregnancy outcomes and health care utilization , " @entity23 wrote			0
most relevant to the burn pit concerns , @entity23 said the @entity2 will " work with the @entity10 to obtain all relevant exposure data with the goal of establishing potential correlations with health problems among affected veterans			1
" " our scientists will also review data gathered from @entity10 's @entity149 surveys , which ask about exposures to smoke from burn pits , subsequent symptoms , and a variety of other health related questions , " @entity23 wrote			1
" @entity2 will evaluate the feasibility of monitoring toxic substances in veterans , although most toxic materials from burn pits may be eliminated from the bodies of exposed veterans in a matter of days or weeks			1
" rep. @entity163 , @entity165 - @entity164 , a leading congressional agitator for further inquiry into this subject , said he was encouraged by the response			0
" since time is of the essence and the lives of our troops and veterans are at stake , we expect the @entity10 will fully cooperate with the @entity2 , so that these analyses can be completed as quickly and accurately as possible , " @entity163 said in a statement			2
@entity178 , with the group @entity179 , said the response is a start but not as focused on the burn pit issue as his group would have liked			0
" this is a decent letter , but it does n't get to the root of the problem , " @entity178 said			0
" i would like to see them do studies on surrounding areas near burn pits compared to nondeployed troops			2
" the @entity2 's decision to look at exposures beyond the burn pits reflects its experience looking into @entity57 , @entity2 spokesman @entity192 said			1
the department recognizes that it needs to start now to investigate long - term affects for burn pit exposure as well as potential exposures that might lead to illness down the road			1
" what we found is after the first @entity36 when a possible threat would be identified , the @entity2 and @entity10 would go all - out looking at that particular problem			2
now we are structuring a broad - based program that is n't going to just ask " were you around burn pits " but ask " how is your health " in general , @entity192 explained			1
in the meantime , @entity192 explained , veterans with health issues they believe are related to the burn pits will get the health care they need from the @entity2			1
" the studies will provide us with the larger picture of the risks the veterans have gone through , " explained @entity192			0
" we have the medicine and facilities to give them the care while the doctors are sorting out what caused what			0
" @entity179 has started collecting information on veterans concerned with exposure			0
its database of nearly 200 veterans with significant exposure to the burn pits shows nearly a third have contracted cancer and another third have developed pulmonary issues , according to the group			1
skin lesions and allergy symptoms have also arisen			0
@entity192 said the @entity2 has not seen evidence so far of significant levels of leukemia and cancer , but he said that does not mean the problem does not exist or may not arise			0
" the key is the research needs to make that connection between the exposure and the disease			0
some of those things do n't match up , but that 's what the research has to validate , " @entity192 said			0
" this does not preclude us from health care if they provide this is service - connected , " @entity192 said			0
" if something is wrong with you that is related or you think is related to military service , the doors are wide open , " @entity192 said .			0

@entity2 finalizing deal with @entity53 to assess potential health risks
decision reflects experience with @entity57 , spokesman says
veterans blame emissions from burn pits for respiratory problems , skin infections
no long - term danger from smoke from @entity65 air force base pit , military said in 2008
