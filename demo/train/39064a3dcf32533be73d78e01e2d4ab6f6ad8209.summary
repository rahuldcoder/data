throw down some drinks at @entity2 bar in @entity3 ? check			0
pull the fire alarm , so about 500 students in @entity7 on the @entity8 campus rush outside , together ? done			1
give them hell ? those three words were the last item of @entity13 's checklist that he made before , authorities say , he would go out with up to 1,000 rounds of ammunition and start shooting , possibly setting off bombs in the process			1
it was not crossed off			0
instead of a mass killing early monday morning , police reported only one fatality : @entity13			1
@entity23 released a day later by @entity8 police shows the moment officers discovered him			1
after getting into his suite , they unlocked his room 's door and barged in , yelling and with their weapons raised			1
it did n't take them long to realize there was no threat			2
the 30 - year - old lay prone on the floor , having killed himself with a handgun			2
" all indications are , just like the rest of his life , he was alone , " @entity8 police chief @entity40 said tuesday			1
after just more than a day of investigating , authorities have been able to piece together much of what happened			0
they have seen surveillance video that shows @entity13 pulling the alarm , then returning to his room			1
they recovered weapons and ammunition as well as four homemade bombs and the checklist			1
they interviewed many who described him as a loner who did n't like to talk to others but was n't viewed as a threat			2
what they do n't know is why he did what he did			0
" there 's no manifesto , there 's no documentation , " @entity40 said			0
" ... we have not uncovered anything that would give us a motive or a rationale			0
" family calls him ' a loner ' the statement issued tuesday by @entity13 's family , initially to the @entity80 , @entity81 , sheriff 's office , did n't shed much light on his thinking			1
" the family of @entity13 states that @entity13 was a loner and did not have a history of violence , " they said			1
from fall 2010 through fall 2012 , he had been a @entity8 student			2
but he was not enrolled for the spring semester , and was in the process of being removed from the dorm room where he lived , school spokesman @entity89 said			0
according to @entity89 , @entity13 was never seen by @entity8 counselors and had not had any student conduct issues			1
he had one prior contact with law enforcement -- a traffic arrest in 2006 -- the police chief said			0
one of his roommates , @entity100 , told the @entity8 student news organization the @entity103 that @entity13 would seemingly make an effort to avoid walking near him , that he would n't say anything back when you said hello			1
" the only time that he made solid eye contact with me was when he was pulling the gun on me , " the roommate said			2
that happened as lights were flashing and the alarm was ringing around 12:20 a.m. monday , inside their suite			0
unsure if he could make it to the hallway , @entity100 ran to his room as @entity119 raised what he later described as a " large assault gun " in his direction			0
" i just slammed the door , " the roommate told @entity125 's @entity124 on tuesday night			2
" i was not going to let him shoot me			0
" @entity100 said he first locked his door , hid behind a chest of drawers , then got behind a cabinet in the bathroom and called 911			0
" my roommate just pulled a fire alarm , and he 's got a gun out , " he told the dispatcher			1
while realizing @entity13 was far from a rah - rah college student , @entity100 did n't consider him a threat			1
but in retrospect , the roommate did say he believed @entity13 was having money problems from having had his hours cut at a job and that , with seemingly no one to turn to , he might have like he was " in a corner			1
" " i just thought that he kept to himself a lot , " he said , according to audio posted on the @entity103 website			0
" i just thought he was a quiet , introverted person			0
" ' i do n't think you do that as a joke ' whatever his relatives and acquaintances thought of him , police said they believe that @entity13 had devious plans of his own			1
waiting for him in the university mail room were two 22 - round magazine clips for his semi-automatic rifle , a sling for that weapon , and a training dvd on how to use its laser and shoot it , authorities discovered tuesday			2
this is in addition to the ample ammunition -- including drum magazines , one of them found attached to the gun , that can contain 110 bullets each -- that authorities have found			0
then there were the bombs , which @entity40 said he believes @entity13 made himself @entity13 likely spent about $ 1,000 to buy the guns and ammunition in february , suggesting his plan was set in motion as early as then , the police chief said			1
of course , there also was the checklist he 'd drawn up -- and largely followed , albeit apparently hours later than he had planned , after scribbling out items such as " get drunk " and " take shower " -- ahead of his death			0
" i do n't think ... you purchase 1,000 rounds of ammunition " without a plan , @entity40 said			1
" i do n't think you do that as a joke			0
" while @entity13 is the only one dead , the mere possibility that he would wage an attack has already had an impact			2
dorms were evacuated , classes were canceled , and the @entity8 campus was shut down			2
counselors were in @entity7 and elsewhere to talk with students coming to grips with the drama			0
school authorities could n't promise that something like this would n't happen again , but they did send out more police on patrol to help students feel safe			2
" all of us have a role to play in the welfare of our campus , " school president @entity208 said tuesday in a statement , " and we will work together to use this experience to make us even more prepared , more alert , and more secure .			0
