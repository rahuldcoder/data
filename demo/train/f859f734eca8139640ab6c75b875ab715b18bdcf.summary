-- the mysterious , faceless green men have entered eastern @entity2 , looking much like they did last month in @entity3 before @entity4 sliced off and swallowed that former province of @entity2			1
what will president @entity6 do now ? unlike @entity4 's @entity3 invasion , the @entity2 government is not rolling over as readily this time , vowing not " to let the @entity3 scenario repeat			1
" that is just what @entity4 president @entity12 needs to justify an open military assault under the guise of " protecting " @entity2 's ethnic @entity4			1
the possibility that war will break out is real			0
@entity19 officials are convinced that the disciplined militias -- who have taken over government buildings in more than half a dozen @entity2 cities , wearing no identifying marks on their uniforms -- are @entity4 special forces or " paid operatives , " deliberately stoking unrest , not part of a spontaneous groundswell of @entity31 sentiment			1
still , @entity19 's warnings of serious repercussions have fallen on deaf ears			2
with the crisis continuing to escalate , @entity6 can choose between four courses of action			2
stop making empty threats @entity6 has repeatedly warned that " there will be costs " if @entity4 takes over @entity2 's territory			1
but that is exactly what @entity4 did			2
efforts to line up @entity46 support for stern sanctions have faltered badly			0
the @entity49 's growl , its bark , seems increasingly toothless			0
the sanctions so far are underwhelming			0
@entity52 and its friends need to impose real sanctions and offer @entity2 real support , or else @entity19 's warnings will be meaningless			1
@entity6 and secretary of state @entity57 still give the impression , despite ample evidence to the contrary , that they think diplomacy and reasoning can dissuade @entity12 from pushing ahead with his goal to dominate @entity2 , fearing that harsh sanctions will provoke him			1
but one way to reverse the course is to exact a harsh economic and political cost while keeping open a way for @entity70 to roll back			0
@entity6 must make a decision : if the @entity19 is not ready to impose muscular sanctions , it 's time to stop issuing threats			1
@entity19 's " red lines " risk becoming an international punch line			2
feeble threats against @entity4 's " incredible act of aggression " are hurting the @entity19 , making it look like a paper tiger and making its friends more vulnerable			1
grave warnings of consequences without consequences do more harm than good			0
decide where to build a moat if the @entity19 is not willing to take risks for the sake of @entity2 , it is time to decide what part of the map matters			1
after @entity96 , the @entity19 came to a decision to reluctantly allow @entity99 control of @entity100 while protecting the western side of the @entity102			0
that was a cold calculation for which the people of @entity105 , @entity106 and elsewhere paid a steep price			0
but it sent a clear message to @entity70 to stop at the edge of that military and ideological barrier			0
@entity52 could just as coldly concede @entity2 , or part of it , to @entity4 and build a ( figurative ) moat around it or choose another place on the map to do that			1
the @entity19 must decide how far is too far			0
is it eastern @entity2 , western @entity2 , @entity119 , the @entity120 ? opinion : @entity19 giving @entity12 green light in @entity2 ? 3			1
consider military action the chances that the @entity19 will go to war over @entity2 are extremely small , but the option exists			1
if @entity4 unleashes its military power across the border , the folder marked " military action " will land on the table in the situation room			2
wars are unpredictable and always bring unexpected consequences			0
fighting on the border of the @entity136 will put @entity137 on high alert and trigger a new set of possible outcomes			0
if @entity2 and @entity4 go to war , the calculations will change drastically and dangerously			1
say goodbye and good luck to @entity2 there 's one more option for @entity6			1
he can turn his back on @entity2 , wish it well and move on			1
the @entity19 could make a decision that it would rather try to continue working with @entity12 on issues like @entity150 and @entity151 , and allow @entity4 to do what it wishes in " its part " of the world			1
it 's a course of action that would satisfy @entity19 isolationists , as well as those who accept @entity4 claims that the troubles are @entity19 and @entity100 's fault			2
that , unfortunately , would invite even more challenges to world peace , as it would empower bullies everywhere			0
@entity19 policy aims , unsuccessfully , toward option no. 1 , but the threats are far ahead of the action			2
several weeks ago , i suggested that there was a chance that " when the stakes grow high enough , the @entity19 and @entity100 may rise to the challenge			0
" that may yet happen			0
but so far it has not			0
@entity12 's platoons of masked green men are wreaking havoc in @entity2 , and the @entity19 still has n't quite decided how it plans to respond			2
in the long run , @entity4 will suffer from the ill will it has engendered with its bullying tactics			0
but in the short and medium term , it is gaining ground .			0

she says @entity19 should impose real sanctions or else it looks like paper tiger
