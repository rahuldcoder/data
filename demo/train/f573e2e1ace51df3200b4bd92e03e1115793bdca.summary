-- take your thumb and hold it out directly in front of you , away from your face			0
now close the left eye			2
open it and close the right eye			0
your thumb appears to have moved , even though you did n't move it with your arm			0
three - d technology capitalizes on this effect , taking advantage of the brain 's ability to fuse two images into one			1
those glasses that you have to wear when watching something in @entity19 are basically helping your brain interpret two flat images as one object that has depth			1
with the success of " @entity25 , " a cluster of @entity19 movies , including " @entity28 " and " @entity29 " , are making their mark in @entity32			1
@entity33 recently announced plans to direct a 3 - d film later this year			0
@entity36 also announced plans for a @entity19 gaming console , the @entity38			1
many electronics companies have @entity19 television models , bringing the opportunity for this enhanced viewing into the home as networks begin to air more @entity19 programming			1
@entity47 's @entity19 channel aired the @entity48 earlier this month , and @entity49 plans to launch a @entity19 sports network this year			2
but doctors say that for eyes unaccustomed to watching 3 - d for hours every day , there are some dangers , including mild symptoms such as disorientation and , in rare cases , seizures			2
the @entity60 comes with a substantial health warning			0
it cautions that certain flashing images or lights could induce epileptic seizure or stroke , and that " motion sickness , perceptual aftereffects , disorientation , eye strain and decreased postural stability " may result			1
doctors say the percentage of people who should worry about significant adverse effects is small , especially the possibility of seizure			0
more commonly , people may experience dizziness or other discomfort after watching something in @entity19 , including a feature film			1
one pair of @entity19 glasses to rule them all symptoms of nausea , headache and fatigue may result because @entity19 causes the eyes to move in an unnatural way , said an e-mail from dr. @entity94 , clinical assistant professor in the department of ophthalmology at @entity97			1
here 's how it works : the 3 - d movie presents two slightly different perspectives of the same scene , superimposed but separated by a specific degree			0
three - d glasses have a polarized filter that separates those two images , allowing each to be seen by a different eye			1
this happens so fast that you do n't see the transitions , said @entity110 , associate professor of ophthalmology at the @entity112 at the @entity113 , @entity114			0
in the brain , the two images are fused , creating the illusion of depth , he said			1
when you see something come toward you in the real world , your eyes slightly cross toward each other			0
at the same time , the lenses change shape in order to keep the object in focus as it moves in your direction , a process called accommodation			0
but when you see images on a screen , your eyes try to align the two images , but not " accommodate , " because the object is not actually moving toward you			2
" the movie is telling you ' hey , i 'm moving around in this scene , ' but your vestibular system is telling you , ' i 'm not moving anywhere , ' and that disconnect will make you feel sick , for some people , " @entity110 said			0
read about 3 - d at @entity142 for those with certain underlying conditions , the artificial environment of a 3 - d movie strains the ocular system , so when you take off the glasses it can be disorienting , said dr. @entity150 , director of ophthalmology at @entity152 in @entity153			2
people whose eyes are not perfectly aligned , or who have a weak eye muscle , will not be able to see in @entity19 , @entity150 said			1
@entity158 , a condition in which the eyes point in different directions , can be an impediment to seeing 3 - d. some people with amblyopia , or lazy eye , may also miss out on the depth perception effect when wearing @entity19 glasses			1
why i ca n't watch @entity170 nusinowitz himself gets dizzy watching @entity19 movies because his eyes have very different refractive errors -- he needs different prescription strengths in each lens of glasses			1
still , based on experiences with patients , he said he believes he 's in the minority			0
" i 'm willing to say that 80 percent of people will not have problems , " he said			0
as for long - term effects of watching 3 - d television instead of regular television , no one knows for sure because it 's too new			0
@entity188 is concerned about serious consequences for children who watch @entity19 television for long periods of time -- " a continuous abnormal stimulus may possibly have long - term effects that are yet to be studied , " she said .			2

in @entity19 movies , glasses help the brain fuse two images , creating the illusion of depth
symptoms of nausea , headache and fatigue may result when eyes move unnaturally
people with certain eye conditions can not see in @entity19
