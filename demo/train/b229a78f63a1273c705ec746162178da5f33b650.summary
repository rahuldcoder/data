-- @entity1 is a 55 - year - old @entity2 who has lived in @entity3 with his family since 2001			1
he works revising @entity6 translations for official @entity9 media online publications and in his spare time he writes his own blog and manages the @entity13 web site			1
@entity14 : " there are fantastic cultural opportunities in @entity3			1
" @entity0 : what makes @entity3 special to you ? circles : @entity3 is the only capital city i 've seen that i would want to live in			1
one big reason is that there are relatively few cars , making the city pedestrian - friendly			2
another is that it 's quite safe for a capital and you feel like the night is your ally instead of your adversary			2
@entity3 is full of contrasts that make life interesting : buildings being restored amid others collapsing			1
there 's an amazing array of cultural activities but it can be hard to buy a nail or cat food or even a roll of toilet paper sometimes			2
i love the parks , the @entity45 seawall and the ever - expanding network of museums that give you the feeling there is always something new to see on a weekend stroll			1
and @entity3 is virtually free of commercial advertising			1
the tv and other media are ad - free as well , and i love that			2
@entity0 : what are your favorite parts of the city ? circles : the @entity45 seawall is a great place to think , relax and observe , because of its majestic views , sea breeze and mix of characters from all walks of life			1
i also love the sprawling grounds , stone walls and magnificent view of the city at the @entity74 across @entity75			2
the @entity77 baseball stadium is also special for a fan like me			0
out on the east side of the city the beaches are fantastic			2
we try to go once every few months and more often in the summer			0
@entity83 is my favorite district			0
it has many large parks , beautiful tree - lined streets and a mix of extremely interesting 20th - century architecture			0
of course , @entity3 is gorgeous , with all the excellent restoration work and many museums			1
i usually find myself going there when i have visitors to show around			0
@entity0 : what do you dislike about life in @entity3 ? circles : the overcrowded housing situation and deteriorated buildings in some parts of the city make for some difficult living situations and many things only work halfway			1
there 's a thick bureaucratic maze to accomplish many simple tasks			0
most people need to do something under - the - table to get by and there are some seemingly ridiculous prohibitions			0
what makes @entity3 special to you ? let us know			1
@entity0 : what 's a typical weekend in the city ? circles : there are fantastic cultural opportunities in @entity3 and they are very accessible to all , normally costing from 10 to 50 @entity2 cents for a ticket			1
my wife and i often go to the theater , to movies , dance performances and concerts			0
i like jazz a lot and this friday there 's an outdoor jam session around the time when people get off work			0
on saturday there 's an early evening informal free concert on the porch of an art gallery			0
there 's also a film festival offering young filmmakers ' works and there are numerous venues for stand up comedians , which are a big favorite of the general population			0
@entity0 : @entity9 music is known throughout the world			1
where are the best places in @entity3 to hear real @entity9 music ? circles : i much prefer what they call the " penas " -- more intimate sessions where friends and followers show up			1
many groups have regular " penas " once or twice a month , where you might hear folk , rumba or jazz			1
these performances are held at a variety of places , outdoor and indoor , and most are free			0
for more formal concerts i particularly like the theater at the @entity173 and the smaller hall at the @entity175			0
the @entity176 also offers a good variety of musical presentations			0
some of the best venues for salsa are the outdoor ones			0
there are outdoor auditoriums in most neighborhoods , like the @entity186 's @entity185 in @entity187 , @entity188 in @entity189 , and @entity190 in @entity191 , where you can see the top salsa bands for under a dollar			0
you can also see top salsa bands for free at the weekend at venues set up in squares or plazas			0
@entity0 : what do you think the future has in store for @entity3 ? circles : the potential is awesome			2
if the hostile policy of the @entity2 towards @entity9 could turn into a good - neighbor policy , or at least more normal ties , the economy of the city would no doubt improve			1
if the travel ban was lifted people from the @entity2 could appreciate all that @entity3 has to offer			1
likewise , if the rest of the blockade was lifted it would present a great challenge to the city 's government to get beyond a virtual state of siege and be able to confront its serious infrastructural needs , housing deficit and , in some areas , highly deficient public works and utilities			2
an onslaught of visitors would also put services to the test and most likely require improvements			0
@entity0 : if @entity3 was a person what would he or she be like ? circles : he or she would be casually sensuous , timeless , sassy and either ' tranquillo ' or combative depending on how the day 's going .			2

@entity1 is an @entity2 who has lived in @entity3 since 2001
