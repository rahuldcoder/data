-- on september 30 , a group of @entity4 from the activist groups @entity1 and @entity2 set out on a visit to support the @entity8 family in the @entity9			0
the family 's claim to their land has been recognized by the @entity15 @entity14 , but the settlement of @entity17 is nevertheless built upon it			2
@entity20 family members have faced harassment for years while insisting on their right to access private land			0
the settlers of @entity17 , enraged by the @entity15 support of the @entity27 family , violently attacked the family and activists alike			1
it is all too common that @entity32 settlements in the @entity9 are built on stolen @entity27 land , and all too common that @entity27 farmers are prevented from cultivating and collecting their rightful harvest anywhere near these settlements			1
in 2007 , in a report based on the government 's own statistics , the @entity15 group @entity37 showed that the majority of settlements are wholly or partially constructed on private @entity27 land			1
regardless of what kind of land they are built upon , settlements are illegal under international law and contrary to @entity49 policy			0
while @entity27 have long faced violence from both settlers and soldiers , now @entity4 who choose to stand up for the basic human rights of @entity27 , can no longer expect protection from their own government			1
in @entity15 they are calling what happened a pogrom			2
what other name is there for state - condoned mob violence directed at a group of people simply because of their beliefs ? until recently , @entity32 @entity15 willing to take the risk of solidarity visits to @entity9 @entity27 have been able to use the privilege they have as @entity32 to minimize violence against @entity27			1
when @entity32 @entity15 activists put their bodies between @entity27 and violence , both soldiers and settlers have held back			1
thus perhaps a field can be plowed or olive tree picked if @entity32 activists accompany @entity27 farmers as in @entity17			1
@entity27 live with the violence and repression of the occupation every day , while the @entity15 only visit it and then return home			1
yet the fact that these @entity15 choose to place themselves in harm 's way for the sake of justice is nothing short of inspiring			2
the violence in the video of the attack is shockingâ € ” knives , rocks , blindside punches , screams of " @entity96 " and " death to @entity98			0
" most horrifying of all were the policemen who stood watching without interfering			0
no arrests were made , and not a single policeman took action as a group of about 50 activists was attacked by a mob of approximately 200 settlers			0
it should n't be surprising that @entity15 soldiers and police choose not to protect some @entity15			2
the status of @entity15 citizens who defy discriminatory government policies regarding @entity27 rights is steadily eroding			1
in july , the @entity115 passed a law making it a punishable offense to advocate for boycotting settlement products			0
this non-violent tactic used worldwide in social justice struggles , a basic tenet of democracy and free speech , is now off - limits for @entity15			2
in august , in a frenzy of unfounded fear of widespread @entity27 violence following a @entity129 proposal on @entity27 statehood , @entity15 announced a new policy of arming and training settlers			1
the settlers have long been armed and dangerous , but this gave them the legitimacy to act with impunity			0
finally , in september , president @entity138 's speech to the @entity129 so lopsidedly supported @entity15 that foreign minister @entity139 , a man even @entity140 called a " neo-fascist , " said that he would " sign onto this speech with both hands			2
" president @entity138 spoke not a word about occupation or settlements or the suffering of @entity27			0
is it any wonder that the settlers in @entity17 felt nothing should hold them back ? the message , from all sides , is that @entity27 on their own land , and now the @entity15 who dare to support them , are a dangerous enemy			1
at the end of the video a woman off - camera says shakily in @entity161 , " this is really dangerous			0
" to put your body in harm 's way for the sake of a righteous cause is both a hallmark of civil rights struggles and a remarkable personal act of will to transcend fear and discomfort			0
the pogrom occurred on the second day of @entity176 , which also marks the beginning , in the @entity32 tradition , of the @entity179 , the days of reflection and repentance that culminate in @entity182 10 days later			0
especially for those of us who were raised with an intimate connection to an image of @entity15 as a safe haven and a beacon of light for all the world , it takes another kind of courage to face what it has become			0
as @entity49 , our government defends @entity15 in the economic , diplomatic and military realms , regardless of its actions			0
for those of us who are @entity32 , @entity15 claims to act in our name			1
if the @entity15 activists are brave enough to face physical harm , if @entity27 farmers risk attack just because they try to work their own lands -- are n't we obligated to face our own discomfort and speak up to end the @entity49 policies which make this disgrace possible ?			1

@entity212 says @entity27 are often the *victims* of attacks from @entity15 settlers
she says many @entity32 @entity15 's stand up to protect the basic rights of @entity27
@entity212 fears that @entity15 who protest could now also be a target for settler violence
