i met a woman named @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , where the @entity5 was reporting on the rollout of @entity7			1
@entity2 had a big smile and was very excited -- you could n't miss her			2
i first noticed her standing in line , waiting patiently to ask a few questions about health care			2
most of the questions i had been asked up until that time revolved around the logistics of signing up , whether they could pick a particular doctor and how much all this was going to cost			0
@entity2 , who did n't give her last name , started by telling me that she had been able to get off @entity19 in the past year			1
before that , she had been living in her car , intermittently staying with friends			0
now she has a place to live , and she 's excited about the prospect of finally being able to get private health care insurance for the first time in her life			1
@entity2 , 35 , told me she works part - time as a hairstylist assistant			0
she said she makes $ 9 an hour , which at 20 hours a week works out to about $ 9,360 a year			0
she is still impoverished , but considers herself lucky because she 's never had a major illness			2
as we spoke about @entity4 's sign - up process , i realized i was explaining some unwelcome news : @entity2 is not eligible for any assistance toward buying health insurance			1
let me try to explain : in a state that has chosen not to expand @entity19 , @entity2 is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for @entity19 , and too little to obtain subsidies through the @entity7			1
this was n't how it was supposed to go down for @entity2 and others like her all over the country			2
when you imagine the people likely to benefit the most from the @entity7 , you probably think of someone just like her			1
by obtaining a real job with enough income , @entity2 has disqualified herself from her state 's medicaid program			2
but in order to qualify for subsidies in @entity4 , she needs to get above the poverty line , and she is not quite there			1
@entity2 and an estimated 7 million others now find themselves in a coverage gap			0
the tax subsidies available through the health exchanges were intended to make private insurance coverage affordable for those between the poverty line and four times as much -- people who now shoulder the responsibility , by law , of purchasing their own coverage			1
last year , in its landmark ruling that left most of the @entity7 in place , the @entity70 @entity69 ruled that the @entity19 expansion is optional for states			1
@entity4 , and 25 other states , turned it down			0
as a result , a big swath of the uninsured will stay that way when new coverage options kick in january 1			0
i asked @entity84 hopeful @entity83 , a @entity85 , who was against the expansion in his state , about this			0
@entity91 gov. @entity90 has been a proponent of the law , and @entity84 has expanded @entity19 to cover anyone making up to 138 % of the poverty line			2
when i described @entity2 's situation to @entity83 , he was sympathetic but immediately replied , " where is the money going to come from ? " his is a common sentiment among leaders of states that have refused @entity19 dollars from the federal government			1
for the time being , the money comes from the federal government			0
in the states that accepted @entity19 expansion , the federal government will pick up 100 % of the tab for four years			1
for the next three years , it will pay for slightly less			0
beyond 2020 it will cover 90 % of the cost			0
the man who oversees the health insurance expansion in @entity114 , dr @entity115 , was stunned that so many states turned the money down			1
according to the analysis in @entity114 , the economic benefits of @entity19 expansion would be in the billions			2
as i walked with him , i asked if he could give a single reason -- medically or financially -- for a state not to accept the medicaid dollars			0
he thought about it for a moment , and said " none			0
" " this is just politics , " he added			0
@entity2 does n't have many options			0
she ca n't get subsidies , @entity19 or health insurance			1
one small solace is that she wo n't be forced to pay any tax penalty for not having insurance			1
" oh well , i guess that is good , " @entity2 replied when i told her			0
she had worked so hard to come off @entity19 , but asked me at the end of the day for a list of states where she might move to get back on the @entity19 program once again .			1

some earn too much money to qualify for @entity19 , but not enough to obtain @entity7 subsidies
*26* states *decided* not to expand @entity19 after the @entity69 's *decision*
those who ca n't get @entity19 or subsidies wo n't pay a fine for not having health insurance
