-- in the winter of 2011 , @entity1 , a 23 - year old professional poker player , was confident that his candidate , president @entity3 , would keep control of the @entity5 in november of 2012			1
but instead of ordering a few lawn signs or volunteering to go door - to - door for the campaign , he put his money where his mouth was			2
@entity1 , who asked that his last name not be used out of legal concerns , bet a @entity14 bookie $ 50,000 that @entity3 would beat the field , at that time the entire cohort of @entity17 slugging it out in the primary			1
" i was very confident , " said @entity1 , a recent graduate of @entity20			2
" no outcome is certain , but this guy was offering me 50 - 50 and i did n't understand how i can turn this down			2
the president , at the very least , was a favorite			0
" it is illegal to vote on the election in the @entity28 -- the @entity14 attorney general 's office told @entity0 that instances of betting on an election are rare -- but that does n't mean betting on an election elsewhere is rare			1
just look across the @entity34 , where most betting institutions in the @entity36 and @entity37 have odds on all things presidential			2
by the numbers : presidential predictions international odds makers are giving the upper hand to @entity3			1
most @entity36 bookmakers this week , aside from a few outliers , give @entity3 1 to 4 odds ( if you bet $ 1 and win , you get $ 1.25 back ) , while @entity48 is getting 11 to 4 odds ( for every $ 4 you bet , you get $ 11 back )			1
@entity50 , a popular @entity52 bookmaker , is one such company			0
they not only offer head - to - head betting opportunities , but they also allow bettors to wager on state - by - state winners , @entity57 numbers and even the odds that @entity48 and @entity3 will tie in the @entity57 ( only 25/1 at time of publishing )			1
by the way , there are also odds on who would win the 2016 presidential election			1
@entity48 is the favorite , @entity66 , @entity48 's running mate , is a close second and secretary of state @entity68 is just behind @entity66			1
@entity69 , the @entity17 business magnate , is getting 100 to 1 odds			2
@entity3 getting better odds @entity50 , like most international bookmakers , has @entity3 as the favorite and @entity48 as the underdog in tuesday 's election			1
in the last few days , possibly looking to take advantage of the odds , a sizable amount of money has been coming in for @entity48 , according to @entity81 © ilim @entity80 , a spokesperson for @entity50			1
" it is over a million pounds sterling ( about $ 1.6 million ) at this stage , " @entity80 says of the amount of money that has been bet so far			0
everyday , he says , bets of over 10,000 pounds -- or about $ 16,000 -- have become normal			2
in order to set the odds , @entity87 says a group of bookies in @entity37 comb through much of the same data that @entity28 political watchers read			1
" all the latest polls will be looked at			0
we also do a line in all the states -- so we watch the regional polls very closely , " @entity87 said			0
" ninety percent of it going in is what the polls are saying			0
" my take : i 've got my money on the @entity104 of @entity105 @entity106 is another popular @entity52 site that allows members to bet on the outcomes of non-sports - related events			0
members buy " contracts " that stipulate what they are worth if whatever outcomes happens			0
for example , at time of publishing , buying one share of " @entity3 to be re-elected president in 2012 " would cost $ 6.65			1
by contrast , the same bets for @entity48 cost $ 3.38			1
according to @entity106 , @entity3 has a 66.3 % chance of winning the election			1
@entity48 has a 33.9 % chance			1
@entity106 has become a website the political reporters and pundits follow regularly			0
when @entity3 's chance of winning on @entity106 began to slip , many @entity17 took to @entity128 to tout the downslide			1
like most betting sites , @entity106 does not allow @entity28 credit or debit cards to be used on the site -- a way to basically prohibit @entity28 from betting on the election			1
brit : @entity28 are too ' emotional ' back at @entity50 , @entity80 jokes that @entity28 may not be the best people to bet on their own election			1
" i know from speaking to @entity28 friends , they tend to have a bit more of an emotional opinion about it , " @entity80 said with a laugh			1
" when we are looking at it on our end , we are setting it very much based on polls and the money that is coming in			0
" the people betting , like @entity1 , see it differently , though			0
" given how little is known by non-political scientists about how elections are determined , almost no one has a good idea about the likelihood about one person winning or not , " @entity1 said			0
when you look at election forecasting models that " rely on more economic data and less on polls , the percentage likelihood exceeds the odds that any sports book is giving			2
" @entity165 does @entity167 's @entity166 one blog the avid bettor reads , he says , is @entity170 , a blog about political science and politics			0
@entity174 , a contributor to the blog and a professor at @entity20 , says he never saw himself as a prognosticator			0
" i never thought of myself as giving a lot of sage advice that then you could make wagers on , " @entity174 says			2
but in saying that , he acknowledges that understanding the data and the historical trend of economic data can lead to " educated guessing			0
" " to the large extent , the inclination of academics is to look at systematic patterns in the past and derive what is going to happen in the future , " @entity174 said			0
" maybe the information is useful , but then again , that perspective opens up the risk that this time is different			0
" it would be easy money if the election were n't close			2
but it is a very close election , " he said			2
bettors like @entity1 remain strident , though			0
" it is a market that is malformed , " @entity1 said			0
" whenever there is a malformed market and you know what you are doing , it is a reasonably good place to put your money .			0

international sites take wagers on who will win the election
it is illegal , however , to make such bets in the @entity28
@entity3 is getting better odds than @entity48 right now
