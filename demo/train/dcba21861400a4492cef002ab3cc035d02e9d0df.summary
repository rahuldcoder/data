-- a @entity2 battleship sunk by @entity4 torpedoes in 1917 is lying upright and almost intact at the bottom of the @entity6 , where it was found by an unmanned submarine surveying a proposed gas pipeline route between @entity10 and @entity11			1
the @entity12 is a @entity2 battleship of the same class as the @entity15 , which is on the floor of the @entity6			1
details of the @entity15 's discovery were released at a news conference thursday in @entity21 , @entity10 , where the pipeline construction company , @entity23 , is based			2
the condition of the @entity26 - era ship is " extraordinarily good , " said @entity27 , a project director with @entity28 , a geotechnical , survey and geosciences company based in the @entity32			0
" it is actually on the seabed in an upright position so you can see the superstructure , " he told @entity0 from @entity33			1
the discovery was unexpected and caused considerable excitement , he said			0
because @entity28 was using an unmanned submarine to chart the seabed , it was not until later that its technicians realized they had found a large vessel			1
" when we were processing the data , we discovered we had actually surveyed over this battleship , " @entity27 said			0
the ship was found in december 2007 , according to documents provided by @entity23			0
in january 2008 , @entity28 collected enough data to determine it was the wreck of a battleship			0
subsequent discussions with the @entity55 confirmed the discovery was the @entity15 , which was built in @entity57 , @entity2 , in 1910			2
it was one of the largest @entity2 naval vessels of the era			1
the @entity15 was carrying 946 officers and sailors and 155 passengers on march 18 , 1917 , when it received a warning that enemy submarines were in the area			1
a lookout raised an alarm after seeing a wake in the water , but no vessel was seen before the @entity15 was hit by two torpedoes fired by the @entity74			1
most of those aboard were rescued , but 296 sailors -- including the captain -- went down with the ship			0
after the torpedoes hit , the ship turned upside down , then rolled again before landing on the seabed , where it slid before coming to its final resting place , @entity27 said			0
although the ship lost some of its superstructure , for the most part it is relatively intact , he added			0
the @entity2 confirmed the identity of the @entity15 by comparing @entity28 's data with design plans			2
@entity27 said he doubts the @entity2 will try to raise the ship because it lies nearly two - thirds of a mile ( about 1,000 meters ) , under water			1
the ship is 472 feet ( 144 meters ) long with four 305 mm 1906 guns in twin mounts ; 12 , 240 mm 1902 guns , also in twin mounts ; and 16 , 75 mm guns in single mounts , according to the ship 's specs			1
it weighs nearly 18,000 tons			0
the @entity15 , which was traveling between @entity102 , @entity2 , and @entity103 , @entity104 , came to rest about 22 miles southwest of the island of @entity106			2
the pipeline carrying natural gas from @entity11 to @entity10 will be rerouted around the ship , the pipeline company said .			0

the vessel is resting in an upright position about two - thirds of a mile under water

an unmanned submarine surveying a proposed pipeline route found the ship in 2007
