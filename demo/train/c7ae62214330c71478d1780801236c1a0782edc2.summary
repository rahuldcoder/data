@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 has fired @entity4 's uncle ahead of his may 3 clash with @entity6 -- and replaced him as trainer with another member of the flamboyant @entity11 welterweight champion 's family			1
@entity4 was furious that his uncle was training his former sparring partner @entity2			1
@entity4 was furious that his father @entity14 was training @entity15 for a fight which could scupper his own hopes of a lucrative rematch with @entity6 , who he beat by a split decision last may in the richest fight in boxing history			1
@entity15 moved quickly to hire @entity23 , @entity14 's younger brother , after hearing @entity4 air his grievances in the media			1
" i asked @entity14 not to train @entity15 , " @entity4 said during a conference call to promote his foray into wrestling at @entity30 's @entity29 on march 30			1
" i 'm upset with my @entity14			0
if he continues to train @entity2 , i have to get another trainer			2
" it 's taking money out of my pocket			2
i told him on numerous occasions not to train @entity2 and he 's training him at my gym			1
" he 's taking money out his own mouth			0
@entity15 is making $ 1 million , so he 's jeopardizing ( the trainer 's share of ) $ 80,000 for millions			1
i could get him that a ton of times over again			0
hopefully it will be worth it			0
" @entity15 had been working with @entity4 for only three weeks			1
" i thought it was funny			0
trainers should be able to train anyone they want			0
but it did n't really surprise me			0
i just wondered why it did n't happen three or four weeks ago when my fight with @entity53 was announced			0
" " @entity2 's a pro , and it does n't bother him , " @entity54 , @entity15 ' promoter , told @entity55			1
" he respects the @entity4 family , and he 's trained with all three brothers , so it 's not going to be a problem			2
" @entity15 has previously been trained by @entity14 , @entity23 and @entity60 , who has been estranged from his world champion son for years , and sparred with @entity4 " it 's more ( a problem ) with @entity4 because he is @entity14 's boss			1
he pays him a nice salary , " @entity2 said			2
" i 'm not upset with @entity14			0
this is just another little story to my story			0
it does n't affect me one bit			0
but it 's just bizarre			0
" @entity4 has trained @entity6 for all of his recent fights -- except the bout against his son last year -- but has said he might cross that line for the rematch			1
" i may have to pay my dad more than @entity53 is paying him , " @entity75 said			2
the 31 - year - old @entity4 , considered pound for pound the best boxer in the world , has not fought since knocking out @entity81 's previously unbeaten @entity80 in @entity82 in december			2
