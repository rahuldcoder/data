editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 's national security analyst , is a fellow at the @entity4 , a @entity5 - based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum , and at @entity9 's @entity8			1
he 's the author of " the @entity10 : an @entity12 's leader			0
" this commentary is adapted from a longer article @entity2 says the evidence is that coercive interrogations likely did more harm than good			1
( @entity3 ) -- former vice president @entity18 said in an interview friday that just - released @entity21 documents demonstrate the effectiveness of coercive interrogation techniques			1
" my sort of overwhelming view is that the enhanced interrogation techniques were absolutely essential in saving @entity29 lives and preventing attacks on the @entity29 , " @entity18 told @entity24			1
" i think they were directly responsible for the fact that for eight years we had no further direct attacks on the @entity29			1
" so what do the newly - released @entity21 documents show , in combination with the other records on the matter already in the public domain ? the first @entity12 member to be subjected to " enhanced interrogation techniques " was @entity42 , a @entity43 @entity12 logistician in his early 30s			1
@entity42 was captured in march 2002 in a shoot - out in @entity45 , @entity46			0
he was the subject of intense interest from @entity29 officials as they believed he was the first @entity12 insider whom they could interrogate who might know the form of the next terror attack			0
and so @entity42 was the first prisoner to be placed in a secret overseas @entity21 prison , this one located in @entity55			0
there he was interrogated by @entity57 , one of the @entity59 's few arabic - speaking agents			0
@entity42 described @entity60 , @entity12 's operational commander , as the mastermind of 9/11 , and he confirmed that @entity60 's alias was " @entity63 , " an important clue in helping to track him down			0
@entity42 's confirmation of @entity60 's role in the attacks on @entity5 and @entity69 was arguably the single most important piece of information uncovered about @entity12 after 9/11 and it was discovered during the course of a standard interrogation without recourse to any form of coercion			1
@entity57 told @entity77 that " we were able to get the information about @entity60 in two days			2
" later , over @entity57 's vociferous objections , a @entity21 contractor stepped in to take over @entity42 's interrogations			2
the @entity59 's standard , non-coercive techniques were jettisoned and @entity42 was stripped naked , deprived of sleep , subjected to loud noise and wide variations in temperature and he was later " waterboarded " 83 times			2
following his arrest in @entity46 in march 2003 , @entity60 was also subjected to intensive coercive measures			2
he was taken to a secret @entity21 prison in northern @entity92 where he initially proved resistant to interrogation			0
in the words of the 2004 @entity21 's inspector general report on detainees that was also released this week , @entity60 was an accomplished resister , provided only a few intelligence reports prior to the use of the waterboard , and analysis of that information revealed that much of it was outdated , inaccurate or incomplete			2
" following his defiance , @entity60 was subjected to a number of coercive interrogation techniques including being waterboarded 183 times			1
but did @entity60 's coerced interrogations really lead to any substantive plots against the @entity29 homeland being averted ? the short answer is no. a document the government released in 2006 around the time @entity60 was transferred from his secret @entity21 prison to the prison camp at @entity114 offered details on the plots he had hatched against the @entity29 : " @entity60 [ @entity60 ] launched several plots targeting the @entity118 , including a plot in late 2001 to have ... suicide operatives hijack a plane over the @entity122 and crash it into a skyscraper on the @entity29 @entity124 ; a plan in early 2002 to send @entity127 operatives to conduct attacks in the @entity29 ; and a plot in early 2003 to employ a network of @entity46 ... to smuggle explosives into @entity69 and to target gas stations , railroad tracks and a bridge in @entity69			1
" the newly - released @entity21 documents merely rehash the range of anti-american plots cooked up by @entity60 that the government already made public three years ago			0
and while this " second wave " of attacks all sounded very frightening , there is no indication that these plots were ever more than just talk			2
the chances of success , for instance , of @entity12 's plan to attack the skyscraper on the @entity124 -- since identified as the 73 - story @entity149 in @entity150 -- were described by @entity60 in one court document to be " dismal			0
" of the terrorists , alleged and otherwise , cited by the @entity21 inspector general that @entity60 fingered during his coercive interrogations , only @entity153 truck driver @entity152 was an actual @entity12 foot soldier living in the @entity29 who had the serious intention to wreak havoc in @entity29			1
however , he was not much of a competent terrorist : in 2002 he researched the feasibility of bringing down the @entity163 by using a blowtorch , an enterprise akin to demolishing the @entity166 with a firecracker			0
if that was the most threatening plot the @entity29 could discover by waterboarding the most senior @entity12 member in @entity29 custody , it was thin stuff indeed			0
and when the @entity175 journalist @entity174 asked @entity59 director @entity173 last year if he was aware of any attacks on @entity29 that had been disrupted thanks to intelligence obtained through " enhanced techniques , " @entity173 replied : " i do n't believe that has been the case			1
" historians will likely judge the putative intelligence gains made by abusive interrogation techniques were easily outweighed by the damage they caused to the @entity29 ' moral standing			0
that is certainly the view of adm. @entity196 , the director of national intelligence , who wrote in april 2009 , " these techniques hurt our image around the world , the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefits they gave us and they are not essential to our national security			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity203 : @entity18 says coercive interrogations saved lives and stopped attacks
@entity2 says evidence shows the most *valuable* information came without coercion
he says information gained through coercion was of *dubious* value
@entity203 : history will show coercive techniques did more harm than good
