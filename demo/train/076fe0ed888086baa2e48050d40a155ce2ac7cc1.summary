@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the shadow of the nation 's oldest operating nuclear power plant , @entity3 fishes along @entity7 in central @entity1 , where he 's caught and eaten bluefish and kingfish for 37 years			1
" i never had a problem with the fish			0
i 'm fine , " says the retiree			0
" there 's not anything wrong			0
" but there is , warns @entity0 mayor @entity16 , who used to fish here himself			0
he worries about leaks of radioactive water the @entity7 revealed two years ago , shortly after the nuclear power plant 's owner , @entity21 , won a license renewal from the @entity23			1
in april 2009 @entity21 discovered two leaks in underground pipes , allowing radioactive tritium to enter the groundwater			1
later that year , in august , @entity21 discovered yet another leak in a six - inch aluminum pipe			2
" i know that tritium is a dangerous radioactive material , " @entity16 said			1
tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen			1
but it 's also a byproduct of nuclear power generation			2
because of the leaks , tritium seeped into the aquifers directly underneath the power plant			1
those underground waterways eventually feed into wells that provide drinking water			0
monitoring wells in @entity1 's @entity48 aquifer last year detected tritium levels of 4 million picocuries per liter , 200 times what the @entity51 considers safe			1
such radioactive spills are a problem nationwide			2
more than half of the country 's 65 nuclear power plant sites have suffered significant tritium leaks or spills , according to the @entity23			1
the worst was at the @entity61 plant , 60 miles southwest of @entity62 , also owned by @entity21 , which leaked more than 6 million gallons of contaminated water , causing some tritium to enter a drinking water well			1
many of the leaks are the result of corroding underground pipes that have not been maintained			0
that can lead to a variety of radioactive compounds entering groundwater , but tritium travels fastest through the soil			1
the commission did not order @entity21 to clean up the spill at @entity7 , an example , some scientists claim , of the agency 's failure to fully protect the public			2
" the @entity23 's almost acting like they 're waiting till somebody dies till they enforce the regulation			1
@entity90 regulation -- that 's too high a price to pay by @entity92 , " said @entity85 , director of the @entity86 of the @entity87			0
@entity85 , a nuclear engineer and former instructor for the @entity23 , claims the commission is playing what he calls " regulatory roulette , " sanctioning plant owners and demanding a clean - up in some cases , such as the @entity61 spill , but not in other instances , like @entity7			1
" the @entity23 ca n't have a ' @entity103 ' that decides when it acts and when it does n't			1
the @entity23 needs to consistently enforce its regulations so that all @entity92 living in all states are protected , " @entity85 said			1
the @entity23 has taken such criticism seriously			1
last year it conducted a self - analysis to determine if it was responding adequately to nuclear plant leaks			1
the commission 's @entity113 found that the " @entity23 response to incidents could be enhanced to be more reliable			2
" " it 's fair to say that we 're inconsistent in our response , " concedes @entity117 , deputy executive director for reactor and preparedness programs at the commission			2
" that was one of the things that we took from that task force was that we needed to be more consistent in how we approach these problems			0
" in the case of @entity7 and other similar plant leaks , however , the @entity23 argues it did the right thing in not sanctioning the plant operators because the radioactive water remained on the property of the nuclear plant			1
" none of the leaks have been significant			0
if you think about the radiological effects of these leaks , none have exceeded our regulatory requirements or have caused any problems from a health perspective to anybody located either onsite or offsite of the nuclear power plants , " @entity117 said			2
@entity1 's @entity149 sharply disagrees			2
not only is it concerned about tritium entering the underground aquifers , but analysis also shows a plume of tritium headed toward @entity7 surface water			0
so the state demanded @entity21 clean up the contaminated groundwater			0
" once that water moved off the plant into the water supply of the state of @entity1 , we felt that it was in our responsibility to go after and protect that water supply , " said @entity149 commissioner @entity159			1
" we felt from @entity1 's point of view , our number - one job was to protect the health and safety of people in @entity1			2
it drilled wells to pump out the contaminated groundwater			0
subsequent measurements indicate tritium levels are steadily dropping as more groundwater is extracted			0
in a written statement , the plant owner told @entity2 , " @entity21 continues to meet with the state on a periodic basis to discuss progress of groundwater remediation for the plant , and we understand we have met expectations to date			0
" the groundwater is processed through the @entity7 plant 's cooling system , where it is diluted			0
then it pours into the @entity7			0
so there are small concentrations of tritium in the creek where @entity3 fishes			0
but both state and federal regulators say those levels are far below what the @entity51 would consider unsafe .			0

a leak of radioactive tritium from a nuclear plant in @entity1 drew no federal sanctions
an @entity23 official concedes the agency has been inconsistent
critic : " the @entity23 ca n't have a ' @entity103 ' that decides when it acts "
