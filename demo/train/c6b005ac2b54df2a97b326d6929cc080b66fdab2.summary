-- three years ago , @entity1 made a choice he knew would brand him as an outsider with many of his fellow hunters : he decided to shoot " green " bullets			1
" it made sense , " @entity1 said of his switch to more environmentally friendly ammo , which does n't contain lead			1
" i believe that we need to do a little bit to take care of the rest of the habitat and the environment -- not just what we want to shoot out of it			0
" lead , a toxic metal that can lower the @entity21 of children , is the essential element in most ammunition on the market today			1
but greener alternatives are gaining visibility -- and stirring controversy -- as some hunters , scientists , environmentalists and public health officials worry about lead ammunition 's threat to the environment and public health			2
hunting groups oppose limits on lead ammunition , saying there 's no risk and alternatives are too expensive			1
the scope of the trend is difficult to measure			0
@entity44 spent an estimated $ 1.08 billion on ammunition in fiscal year 2008 , according to tax reports from the @entity47			2
but the bureau does not track ammunition sales by type			0
industry groups are tight - lipped about their sales figures			2
manufacturers contacted by @entity0 declined to release specific numbers			0
@entity55 , which manufactures copper bullets because , the company says , they perform better than lead , is seeing increased interest in its non-lead products , said @entity61 , the @entity63 company 's spokeswoman			1
@entity1 , of @entity64 , @entity65 , has noticed new manufacturers jumping into the green bullet game			1
" they 're definitely coming out			0
@entity70 and @entity71 , all the big - name ammo makers are loading green ammunition now , " he said			2
some firing ranges are banning lead for safety reasons			2
lead bullets contaminate military training grounds across the country and are the subjects of many environmental cleanups			1
@entity65 and other state governments have taken up lead bullets as a matter of policy			1
they worry that lead from the bullets contaminates ecosystems and could affect people			1
last year , @entity65 banned lead bullets in the chunk of the state that makes up the endangered @entity65 condor 's habitat			1
the large birds are known to feed on scraps of meat left behind by hunters			0
those scraps sometimes contain pieces of lead bullets , and lead poisoning is thought to be a contributor to condor deaths			1
@entity102 , another condor state , gives out coupons so hunters can buy green ammunition			2
@entity63 may soon follow suit			0
in @entity109 , a hunter has raised concerns about lead 's potential impact on humans			2
dr. @entity115 , a dermatologist and falconer , saw a presentation about the potential dangers of lead at a board meeting of the @entity121 , a group devoted to conserving birds of prey			2
he decided to collect and test venison samples that were going to be donated to a local program for the hungry			0
about half of the 100 samples -- all shot by hunters -- tested positive for lead , he said			2
food banks and shelters pulled the meat from their shelves after the report			0
" when we did this , i about fell out of my shoes , " he said			0
" the scary thing is these fragments are almost like dust in the meat			0
they 're not like metal fragments you would feel when you bite down			2
" states in the area started investigating the issue after @entity148 's findings			2
working with the @entity150 , the @entity109 @entity149 ran a test to find out the health effects of lead - shot game			0
the agency compared blood - lead levels of people who regularly eat meat shot with lead bullets with the levels of those who do n't eat much wild game			1
those who ate the lead - shot meat had slightly higher blood - lead levels than those who did n't , but none of the 738 people in the study had levels above the government 's threshold for danger			1
still , the health department recommended that children younger than 6 and pregnant women stop eating venison shot with lead bullets because those groups are at particular risk for lead poisoning , even at low levels			1
the department also recommended lead - free bullets as the simplest solution to possible contamination			1
the @entity187 followed with its own study , which found that when lead bullets explode inside an animal , imperceptible particles of the metal can infect meat up to a foot and a half away from the bullet wound -- farther than previously thought			1
more research is needed to tell for sure if lead - shot meat poses a risk to people , said dr. @entity200 , an epidemiologist at the @entity109 @entity149			0
but until that research is done , people should take sensible precautions , he said			0
" there is no cause for alarm , but it is another source of lead in the environment , " he said of lead ammunition			0
hunting groups say lead bullets pose no risk to people or the environment			1
available studies -- particularly the one from @entity109 -- prove that point , said @entity215 , spokesman for @entity216			0
" the @entity150 study confirmed what hunters have known for centuries : consuming game hunted with traditional [ lead ] ammunition has never been shown to pose a health risk to anyone , " he said			1
@entity200 said @entity215 's group is misrepresenting science			0
the @entity216 and the @entity229 say efforts to ban lead ammunition are veiled attempts to take guns away from hunters			0
they also point to the fact that lead 's main alternative , copper , is more expensive and is n't available in all calibers			1
@entity215 said the added expense will drive many people away from a sport that is part of @entity44 heritage			0
" many hunters believe lead is the best metal to be used for hunting , " he said			1
" add into that that it [ lead ] is very affordable and it is very available			0
we think this absolutely should be left up to hunters			0
" dr. @entity254 , interim department chair of environmental health sciences at @entity257 's @entity256 , said the public should switch away from lead bullets -- even if the research is still developing			1
" it 's hard to imagine that you could make a bullet out of something more toxic than lead , " he said			2
@entity1 , who switched to green ammo and blogs on the issue , said that lead should n't be banned from hunting but that hunters and the public should be more aware of lead 's potential to cause harm			1
" @entity276 will get into you , and we need to be working towards getting it out of the system , " he said			0
" i think it 's something we could do away with over time			0

green bullets are those that do n't contain lead , a toxic metal
last year , @entity65 banned lead bullets in the area where an endangered bird lives
copper bullets are the main alternative to lead
hunting and gun groups oppose bans on lead bullets , saying they pose no risks
