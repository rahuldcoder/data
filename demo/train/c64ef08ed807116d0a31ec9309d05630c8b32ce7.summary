-- @entity1 secured his first @entity3 title and first win outside of the @entity5 sunday -- but in typical fashion took his own very individual route to an unlikely victory			1
the two - time @entity9 champion held a two - shot lead with three holes to play in the @entity13 event in @entity14 before going bogey - double bogey to trail by one playing the 18th at the @entity17 course			2
his hopes looked over when his second shot to the par - five found a green side bunker but the 36 - year - old @entity5 had one more moment of magic left in his locker			0
he blasted the ball onto the green and then watched as it rolled 25 - feet into the cup for an eagle three			0
that left him tied on 11 - under 277 with @entity31 @entity30 and a playoff followed over the same 18th hole			1
a pumped up @entity1 was not to be denied and a 20 - foot birdie putt was enough for him to secure his seventh career victory and third of 2014 , including the masters at @entity38			0
" for me this is the big one , " @entity1 told the @entity40 website			0
" it 's very big because i always wanted to win outside the @entity5 " @entity1 said the his wonder shot on the final hole of regulation play came as a surprise even to him			1
" it was such a tough bunker shot you are not really thinking about making it , but i told my caddie it 's been a wild day , a wild couple of holes , but if we can make this it changes everything and it went in like a putt			0
" overnight leader @entity58 , who had been at the head of affairs since the first day , saw his chances disappear with a final round 73 to end in a tie for third with @entity5 @entity63 and @entity64 of @entity65			1
all three also had chances on the final hole of at least joining the playoff , but @entity63 found the water while @entity58 and @entity64 could not make the requisite birdie			1
@entity72 champion @entity71 was another in the mix , but he found the water on the 18th with his second shot and made a double bogey seven to finish in a tie for sixth on eight under with @entity79 's @entity78 and @entity80 of @entity81			0
world number one @entity83 did not take part in the tournament while @entity1 will rise to third in the rankings after his latest victory .			2
