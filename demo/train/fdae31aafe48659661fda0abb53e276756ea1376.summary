@entity0 -- a large white poster dominates @entity4 's simple room			1
in black @entity6 script she has written the story of her decade - long struggle for justice			1
a story of how a simple legal dispute ended years later with @entity4 being branded a prostitute and thrown into solitary confinement			1
" a day in that place felt like a year , " she says			2
" ordinary people would n't be able to understand			2
" @entity4 's story begins , like many legal battles in @entity6 , over a property dispute with a powerful neighbor			1
she says that when she won a civil case against the neighbor , he sent thugs to beat her up			0
they left her unconscious , several teeth knocked out of her lower jaw			0
at first , complaints to the local police were met with indifference , she says			0
so @entity4 started to petition			1
following a centuries old tradition that started in dynastic @entity6 , @entity4 tried to take her grievances to local and national authorities			1
she says all she received was more beatings and humiliations			0
" we are powerless people in @entity6 , " she says			1
" either you have money in @entity6 and you have power or you are poor and you have none			1
i followed the law and i had to suffer			0
" over time , her petitioning became more overtly political			0
she started to display signs with slogans like " power and money rules in @entity6 " and " in @entity6 there is no justice and no equality			1
" state security took notice			0
they would n't let her leave her building during @entity0 's @entity52 , she says , adding that she was carefully monitored during state visits			0
when police caught @entity4 with documents for petitioning at a sports event in southern @entity6 , they finally lost their patience			1
charged under a provision for " hooliganism , prostitution , theft and fraud , " @entity4 was shipped to the @entity64 in southern @entity0			1
the re-education through labor system , or laojiao as it 's known in @entity6 , began in the 1950s as a way for the fledgling @entity69 government to maintain order and stability in the chaotic post-revolution years			1
half a century later , the system still allows police and other state security agents to arrest offenders for up to four years without trial			1
the government admits there are re-education facilities across the country and , by its own estimate , says they house tens of thousands or even more than a hundred thousand prisoners			2
despite repeated requests , no officials would comment about @entity4 's case or about the country 's re-education system			1
while @entity90 was designed for petty thieves and prostitutes -- minor criminals that officials did n't want clogging up the courts -- rights groups believe that it is a convenient place to put government agitators			2
" it is a way to silence people , " says @entity99 's @entity98			2
" it is a way to silence dissent and keep those quiet that offend the government			2
" journalists , petitioners and members of the banned religious sect @entity110 have all been put in re-education centers , says @entity112 , a researcher for a @entity6 human rights group			1
" it is widely viewed as a convenient way to punish @entity6 citizens who exercise constitutionally - protected civil liberties , " he wrote in an email interview			2
human rights activists and liberal @entity6 intellectuals see the 10 years of @entity121 and @entity123 's leadership , while overwhelmingly positive for the nation 's economy , as a lost opportunity to reform @entity6 's legal system and protect the individual rights of ordinary @entity6			1
now , there is a push for reform			0
" re-education through labor is illegal , " says @entity132 , a prominent law professor at @entity134 's law school			2
" the constitution should protect the basic rights of the people and if we ca n't implement it successfully it means the rights of the people wo n't be protected			0
" @entity132 and more than a hundred other prominent academics , journalists and economists wrote and posted an open letter online earlier this year that called for incoming president @entity149 to ratify @entity151 rights treaties and respect basic principles of human rights			0
( read a draft translation here			0
) pressured in part by anger on social media , the government has pledged to reform the system			1
recently , state media quoted officials saying it will be done by the end of 2013			0
however , none have elaborated on what the potential reforms could be			0
president @entity149 , while pledging to fight corruption and trim government excesses , shows few concrete signs of reforming @entity6 's legal system or allowing more public dissent			1
" even if re-education through labor is abolished , there are many other forms of administrative detention that effectively do the same thing , " says @entity99 's @entity98			2
@entity132 , like many @entity6 , sees extrajudicial prisons as a way for government officials to settle scores , silence petitioners , and muzzle critics " it stains our reputation			1
it makes @entity6 a joke			2
it causes a lot of tragedies for the victim , it does n't help with our stability and security , so i believe that re-education through labor system should be abolished immediately , " says @entity132			1
@entity4 was broken by her time in @entity200 prison			2
she says she was put in solitary confinement when she refused to admit the charges against her			0
she says it was a matter of principle			0
when she got out , after more than a year in prison , she vowed to keep fighting for justice			0
but she does n't hold out much hope			0
" on the television the @entity69 shows that it is taking care of everything and i really believed it			0
but when you encounter real trouble it 's different			0
whatever you say they will ignore you and punish you			0

petitioner @entity4 spent more than a year in one of @entity6 notorious labor camps
re-education through labor system allows people to be held for four years without trial
the prisons are seen as a way for officials to settle scores and muzzle critics
government has pledged to reform the system but little progress so far
