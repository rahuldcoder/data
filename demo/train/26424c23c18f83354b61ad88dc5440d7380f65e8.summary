-- it 's not often that i agree with @entity3			1
but when she comes around to a liberal point of view on an issue , that is to be noted with praise			0
so , good for you , @entity14 , for flip - flopping on the issue of hard work			1
@entity3 took to @entity15 recently to praise the remarks of liberal actor @entity17 , who has in the past donated tens of thousands of dollars to @entity19 and participated in a star - studded video pledging , " to serve our president ( @entity22 ) and all mankind			1
" so how did this @entity25 liberal become the darling of @entity3 ? by speaking out on behalf of a truly liberal value : hard work			1
" i believe that opportunity looks a lot like hard work , " @entity17 said in a speech he gave at the @entity30			1
" i 've never had a job in my life that i was better than			0
i was always just lucky to have a job			0
and every job i had was a steppingstone to my next job , and i never quit my job until i had my next job			0
" @entity3 and other conservatives lept to embrace @entity17 's comments , as though they were conservative			1
they are , of course , profoundly liberal			0
it is liberals who honor , extoll and reward hard work			1
that 's why president @entity22 , @entity49 , @entity50 and virtually all @entity19 support raising the minimum wage -- to honor and reward those who choose work over welfare , and ensure an honest day 's work pays enough to feed a family			2
that 's why president @entity22 and the @entity19 cut taxes on working people by $ 3,600 over four years			2
and that 's why president @entity22 won the votes of working - class @entity62 ( those making less than $ 100,000 a year ) by a full 10 points			2
but perhaps @entity3 and others on the right have seen the light			2
perhaps @entity17 's bracing and bold statement of liberalism has moved them			2
if so , let 's see them walk the walk			2
because at the present moment @entity75 seem to honor wealth and punish work			1
how else can you explain that they want a tax code in which a billionaire heiress pays nothing on her inheritance , while the hard - working maid who makes the heiress ' bed pays taxes on every nickel she earns ? @entity75 presidential nominee @entity88 pocketed $ 42 million during 2011 and 2012			2
he did not earn that money from work -- he accrued it through wealth			0
his investments garnered him tens of millions while he ran around the country campaigning			0
and yet @entity88 paid merely 12 % in taxes			0
by contrast , a cop married to a teacher , each making the median income of around $ 50,000 a year , pays a marginal tax rate of 25 %			0
even with deductions they are almost certainly paying a greater percentage of their income in taxes than mega-millionaire @entity88			0
@entity3 , who famously quit on the people of @entity106 when she got too big for the gig of governing her beautiful state , is an especially unfortunate spokesperson for the value of hard work			1
one hopes she takes @entity17 's liberal advice to heart , and supports working people in word and deed			1
and if @entity3 liked @entity17 's @entity30 remarks , she 'll love this statement : " @entity118 may not come quickly or easily			1
but if you strive to do what 's right , if you work harder and dream bigger , if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time , then i 'm confident that , together , we will continue the never - ending task of perfecting our union			0
" those are not the words of @entity17			0
no , the liberal extolling hard work and patriotism in those comments was @entity3 's president -- and mine and @entity17 's and every @entity62 's president : @entity22			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity141 .			0

@entity3 praised @entity17 for his speech about the *importance* of working hard
@entity141 : so how did this @entity25 liberal become the darling of conservatives ?
he says perhaps conservatives saw the light ; if so , let 's see them walk the walk
@entity155 : liberals extoll hard work ; conservatives honor wealth , punish work
