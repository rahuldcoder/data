-- moments after president @entity2 said a " mix of human and systemic failures " allowed a man to try to bomb a passenger jet on christmas day , federal agencies said they had done all they could			1
" a systemic failure has occurred , and i consider that totally unacceptable , " @entity2 told reporters tuesday during his vacation in @entity9 , referring to what authorities allege was @entity13 's failed attempt to blow up a @entity15 plane preparing to land in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the president said information on @entity13 should have sufficed to alert authorities to prevent him from getting on the flight from @entity23 , @entity24			1
" what already is apparent is that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " @entity2 said			0
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake			0
" federal authorities have charged @entity13 , 23 , of @entity40 , with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach			1
the device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at his seat			2
@entity2 has ordered preliminary results of an investigation into what went wrong by thursday			0
however , the president said @entity55 intelligence officials had received information signaling @entity13 might be a terrorism threat but failed to take steps to prevent the man from boarding the flight			1
" it 's been widely reported that the father of the suspect in the @entity65 incident warned @entity55 officials in @entity67 about his son 's extremist views , " @entity2 said			1
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no - fly list			1
" @entity2 cited " other deficiencies , " saying " there were bits of information available within the intelligence community that could have and should have been pieced together			0
" the airport security system created after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity55 was " not sufficiently up to date to take full advantage of the information we collect and knowledge we have , " @entity2 said			1
" had this critical information been shared , it could have been compiled with other intelligence , and a fuller , clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged , " @entity2 said			2
" the warning signs would have triggered red flags , and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for @entity55			1
" @entity2 said that the inability to take proper action on " information on a known extremist " showed the system had failed			0
soon after @entity2 delivered his remarks , a reliable source told @entity0 's @entity105 that @entity13 's father talked twice about his son 's extremist views with at least one @entity110 representative at the @entity111 in @entity40 and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency			1
@entity55 officials said the father , a former @entity40 banker , expressed his concerns about his son 's radicalization during two meetings and more than one telephone call with embassy officials			2
the information was sent to @entity110 headquarters in @entity124 , @entity125 , but sat there for five weeks and was not disseminated until after the @entity65 incident , the source said			1
had that information been shared , the man might have been denied passage on the flight , the source said			1
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the federal government had information that , meshed with other information , " would have allowed us to disrupt the attempted terrorist attack " before the suspect boarded the jet at @entity140 in @entity23			2
" what we have here is a situation in which the failings were individual , organizational , systemic and technological , " the official said			0
" we ended up in a situation where a single point of failure in the system put our security at risk , where human error was compounded by systemic deficiencies in a way that we can not allow to continue			0
" but a @entity55 intelligence official said that the son 's name , passport number and possible connection to extremists were indeed disseminated			1
the official said @entity13 's father never said his son was a planning an attack			2
" the old man wanted help finding his kid , " the intelligence official said			0
" if he thought he was a bona fide terrorist , and he wanted him back , the embassy in @entity40 would have been the last place to go			0
the @entity55 does n't send terrorists home , no questions asked			1
i 'm not aware of anything that suddenly would have lit up the board and flagged @entity13 ... as a terrorist on his way to @entity55			1
but it 's the season for second - guessing , so anything goes			0
" the official added , " i 'm not aware of a magic piece of intelligence -- somehow withheld -- that would have put @entity13 on the no - fly list			2
" @entity110 spokesman @entity185 defended the agency 's actions regarding @entity13			1
" we learned of him in november , when his father came to the @entity111 in @entity40 and sought help in finding him , " @entity185 said			0
" we did not have his name before then			0
also in november , we worked with the embassy to ensure he was in the government 's terrorist database -- including mention of his possible extremist connections in @entity201			1
we also forwarded key biographical information about him to the @entity204			0
" @entity185 said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done			0
@entity208 spokesman @entity207 said department staff did what they were supposed to have done by sending a cable to the @entity204 in @entity213 about the matter			0
@entity207 said any decision to have revoked the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision			0
but a @entity55 government official said the information in the cable offered nothing specific and was just one of hundreds of such reports that the center evaluates daily			2
meanwhile , in the @entity201 capital of @entity230 , authorities were questioning congregants at a mosque and students and faculty at a school attended by @entity13 , the spokesman for @entity201 's embassy to the @entity55 said tuesday			1
@entity236 told @entity0 's " @entity246 " that an assertion by the local @entity239 group that @entity13 's action was in retaliation for airstrikes against them was " unfounded " and " most likely " propaganda , but left open the possibility links could emerge			2
" i think the @entity239 statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of december is unfounded , because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that , " @entity236 said			0
@entity13 bought his ticket from @entity257 , @entity40 , to @entity16 , @entity17 , via @entity23 on the day before the december 17 airstrike , @entity40 officials said			2
conversations with the suspect 's former acquaintances have turned up no link to @entity239 , @entity236 said			0
" @entity13 , according to the questionings carried on today by his classmates and administrative officials of the school , he was a friendly person and did not ring any alarm bells , " he said			2
but senior @entity2 administration officials said tuesday they are starting to see a link to the terrorist group			0
" some of the new information that we developed overnight does suggest that there was some linkage there , " one of the senior administration officials said			0
the senior administration official was referring to intelligence that @entity282 officials obtained late monday and then briefed @entity2 about on tuesday in a secure conference call			0
@entity284 claimed responsibility for the failed bombing , calling it retaliation for what it said were @entity55 airstrikes on @entity201 soil			1
@entity292 said airstrikes launched against @entity284 on december 17 and december 24 were launched solely by the @entity201 government , but acknowledged the @entity55 has provided assistance since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			2
@entity55 officials say they have provided intelligence on @entity284 targets to @entity201 's government , but wo n't say whether @entity55 aircraft or drones have taken part in strikes .			1
