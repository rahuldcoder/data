earlier this week -- let alone doing it as his bearded 1970s self			1
@entity9 tells @entity0 how it all came together			1
" we have a great writer , @entity11 , " @entity9 says			1
" it was his idea to do the @entity7 [ parody ] , and ' @entity14 ' and ' @entity15			2
' we were tryin ' to think of [ another one ] , and he was like , ' dude , i think i found the song : we should do ' @entity3 ' by @entity5			2
' and i listened to the song and went , ' @entity21 , it could be great			2
' " we were just gon na do that as @entity7 , but in the meantime , we 'd been talking to [ @entity2 manager ] @entity25			1
i know he 'd loved the [ " glee " / " @entity26 " ] emmy opening			1
they called us up and said , ' @entity2 wants to come on and do a couple songs off the box set and the new record			1
' i was like , ' @entity32 -- would he be up for a bit ? ' we did n't hear back for a couple days , but they said , ' yeah , he 'd be open to it -- he 's not really into that stuff , but if you wan na pitch him something			2
' " so we did a scratch track in my office , sent it to @entity2 -- and he loved it			1
he was like , ' i 'm in ! ' and then @entity25 -- this is the craziest call -- says , ' i have an idea : if @entity6 's being @entity7 from the ' 70s , maybe @entity2 should be @entity2 from the ' 70s ? we 'll get a beard ... ' and i was like , ' what ? ' so he says , ' here 's his number , give him a call and talk about it			1
' " exclusive listen : fifteen @entity2 songs fast - forward to @entity2 and @entity6 in the makeup room			1
" he brought his actual sunglasses from the " @entity26 " times , and he goes , ' i got the glasses , i just need a floppy hat			1
' we got him one , and we taped this beard on him , and he goes , ' wow , that 's it right there			2
' and i go , ' do you want to put the wig on ? ' and he 's laughing , ' what are you trying to do to me ? ! ' there was no one else in the room			0
i go , ' let me shut the door			0
it 's just me and you			0
just put the wig on , and we see if it looks good			0
' he was so sad ! so i put a wig on @entity2 , and then he put the hat over the wig and looked in the mirror , and he was just like , ' whoa			1
' and that was it			0
he looked exactly like he looked in 1970			1
" so then we went to show @entity25 what we did , and i think he started [ tearing ] up a little bit , to be honest			0
he was just , like , ' gosh , @entity2 , you look like when we first started working together			1
that 's crazy ! ' like , when would he ever do [ something like ] this ? you do n't dress up as yourself at home			0
it was a really cool moment			0
check out the exclusive @entity0 q&a with @entity2 " right before he was about to come out i heard applause backstage in the hallway -- i was like , ' what was that ? ' and said , ' he just walked into everyone from his camp			1
' no one had seen him yet , just @entity25 , and people freaked out			0
they were like , ' oh my @entity21 , @entity2 , you look so young			2
' everyone was getting nostalgic			0
" one of my friends who was at the show was like , ' i 'm the biggest @entity111 fan			0
there 's no way he would do that ! ' it was just so fun			0
he just went for it and nailed it , and all i kept saying in my head was , ' keep a straight face ... keep straight face			0
' " i 've listened to it probably 10 times already			2
