-- after conquering the race track , superstar colt @entity1 is set to become one of the most sought - after gigolos on the planet -- and his rival 's mum could be the perfect love match			1
in a plot reminiscent of a daytime soap opera , champion race horse @entity1 would be an ideal mate to rival @entity15 's mum , experts say			1
@entity1 wrapped up his stellar career in the @entity17 at @entity18 on saturday with an unblemished 14 - win record , while @entity21 mare @entity15 also remains unbeaten in 22 races			2
the two highest - rated race horses in the world had been tipped to meet in the breeding sheds once six - year - old @entity15 also retired			1
but the " @entity28 " of the racing world would n't necessarily produce champion bundles of joy			2
in fact , distance runner @entity1 may be better suited to @entity15 's mum -- 11 - year - old @entity21 mare @entity31			1
" to be honest , @entity1 and @entity15 's bloodlines are n't ideally suited , " @entity33 , of @entity34 in @entity21 , told @entity0 , when asked if the equine equivalent of @entity37 stars @entity38 and @entity39 was on the cards			1
" i would have their genetic make - up tested using the @entity45 method -- this would ascertain if @entity1 has any sprinting or middle distance genes in him			0
" otherwise a pure stayer to a pure sprinter could end up with a slow horse			0
" @entity15 's co-owner @entity52 had hinted that @entity1 may be a good match , telling @entity21 newspaper the age : " we would consider going to @entity1 because he is clearly the best distance horse in the world			1
" but it seems @entity15 's mother @entity31 may be better suited to the task			1
she has already proved herself to be a wonder mom , giving birth to successful racing horses @entity63 and @entity62			0
her recent foal , the half - sister to @entity15 , sold for $ 2.6 million at auction in april			0
four - year - old @entity1 earned @entity68 owner @entity67 more than $ 4 million in prize money on the race track			1
but even greater returns await in his new life as a stud , with thoroughbred owners across the world sending in their mares ' cv 's in the hope of securing a date with arguably the greatest race horse of all time			1
the @entity83 horse is expected to start his new duties in february , commanding a fee of $ 160,000 each time he sires a foal			2
and with three to four mares falling under @entity1 spell every day , the colt could notch up $ 16 million each year -- depending on his libido and fertility			2
mating usually takes place in a special breeding shed , with handlers overseeing the union			0
the mare will have thick padding placed on her back and hind feet to guard against injury of the expensive thoroughbreds			0
should he fail to rise to the occasion , @entity1 may well return to the race course , as other champion thoroughbreds have done in the past			0
for now , @entity1 will have a few weeks rest before he heads to pastures new -- at @entity109 , @entity111 - part of the @entity113 breeding arm of @entity67 's racing operation			2
@entity1 is quite the catch for equine cupids -- his father was 2001 @entity118 winner @entity119 , while his mother @entity120 won six races during her career			0
" as with most bluebloods , @entity1 's colt would potentially be worth tens of millions of dollars , " @entity33 said			0
" as a yearling ( a race horse between one and two - years - old ) , it could be worth $ 3 million to $ 10 million -- depending on a potential bidding war between @entity131 's @entity130 and sheikh @entity133 's @entity132			1
" there 's no guaranteeing the quality of @entity1 's offspring			0
but if his parents are anything to go by -- father @entity119 had huge stamina , while mother @entity120 possessed speed -- older female @entity141 may prove to be a match made in heaven .			0

champion race horse @entity1 one of the world 's most sought - after mates
had been tipped to breed with @entity15 in " @entity28 " union of the racing world
but experts say @entity1 better suited to @entity15 's mother -- 11 - year - old mare @entity156
@entity1 expected to breed with up to four mares a day , earning $ 160,000 each time
