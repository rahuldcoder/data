-- eleven years ago , @entity1 ignored her family 's objections and became one of the few female firefighters with the @entity7 , better known as the @entity7			1
and this week , with her trademark determination , she broke through a different traditionally all - male barrier : the @entity10			1
@entity1 is the first woman to be featured as eye candy in the calendar 's 11 - year history , something that typifies her grit and will			1
" i was n't going to let anyone tell me i could n't do what i wanted to do , " she said told the @entity17			0
" i wanted my picture in the calendar so that young girls and young women can see me and know that they can do this job			1
" @entity1 is a 14 - year veteran of the @entity7 and a member of @entity28 60 in the @entity29 , the department told @entity0			1
she joins 12 male colleagues on the calendar 's steamy pages and will be featured in march			1
there are about 10,300 firefighters in all ranks of the @entity7 and 46 of those are women , according to the department			2
that equals less than half of one percent			0
" when i step foot into the firehouse , i have to be able to tell myself that i 'm willing to risk my life to save someone else , " @entity41 told the @entity17			0
" i always go above and beyond , because that 's my job			1
" a positive reaction from the @entity7 facebook page to the @entity49 , the reaction to @entity1 ' calendar inclusion has been overwhelmingly positive			1
the consensus : even a calendar with a reputation for showcasing traditional masculinity must catch up with the times			0
" i think it is so so cool that you have a lady in the calendar this year , " one @entity58 user said			0
" i am glad that a sexy woman of color is representing not just the @entity7 but @entity65 all over the country			0
" another commenter was equally inspired			0
" can i just say how freakin ' awesome it is to see a woman in the @entity7 ? i know there are female fire fighters but they are so far & few between & even better that she made the calendar ! ! ! keep saving lives girl ! ! ! you are an inspiration to women everywhere ! " this type of reaction is exactly what @entity79 wants to hear			1
as a fire lieutenant in @entity82 , @entity83 , and a trustee at the @entity49 , she knows how difficult it can be for women to assimilate in a fire department			1
" it 's not easy to fit in , " she told @entity0			2
" the stereotype is that you 're a fireman			0
but we 're firefighters and we 're trained to do the job			2
not everyone needs to be a muscle - bound giant to do the job			0
" @entity79 has been in the fire service for 21 years			1
like @entity1 , she joined after being an emergency medical technician			1
" i was very fortunate that i worked for a metro department with 18 % female firefighters , when nationwide it 's about 4 % , " she said			2
" i was well accepted			0
... in other departments it can be very difficult			0
" she listed several issues the @entity49 seeks to address for female firefighters , including the need for personal bathrooms , sleeping quarters and freedom from workplace harassment			0
still , @entity79 felt that @entity1 ' inclusion in the @entity7 calendar was a sign of slight progress			2
" i really appreciate that ( @entity1 ' ) goal was to let other women know they can do it , " @entity79 said			1
" for me , when little girls come up to me and say ' oh , now i know i can do this , ' it 's the best feeling			0
" " this woman is helping more people understand			0
" all proceeds from the 2015 calendar of heroes benefit the nonprofit @entity128 .			2

first female firefighter , @entity1 , featured in 2015 @entity10 of heroes
mines : " i always go above and beyond , because that 's my job . "
