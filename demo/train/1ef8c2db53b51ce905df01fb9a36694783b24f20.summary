-- standing on the podium at @entity3 , @entity1 achieved her greatest dream -- and gave hope to millions around the world who suffer from a condition that can have devastating effects on self - confidence			1
together with teammates @entity11 and @entity13 , @entity1 pedaled to glory in the women 's team pursuit at the @entity18 velodrome , smashing the world record three times along the way in the qualifiers , semis and final			1
@entity24 was clearly an incredible personal triumph for @entity1 , then 23 , but it was also a source of inspiration to fellow alopecia sufferers who saw the young @entity30 stand bold and bald on top of the podium			1
" an olympic gold medal at a home games -- i do n't think you can top that , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity39 series			1
her timing could not have been better			0
" it happened to be on @entity43 , which was quite a spooky coincidence , " adds the five - time world champion			1
" there was a massive response from a lot of people with and without alopecia , saying it was great that i was showing off the condition to the world			1
" i think it 's good to show people if you have a condition like this you do n't need to hide away and not follow your dreams			0
you can still do whatever you want to			0
" @entity1 has endured alopecia areata ( a condition that causes partial or total hair loss ) for most of her life and sports a wig when she 's not on the track			1
" for as long as i can remember i 've always had small bald patches but i was able to cover them up with the rest of my hair , " she explains			2
" but when i was 10 i got more and more patches , more and more kept falling out until it had all completely gone			2
" i 'd had nice long hair			2
i used to love doing plaits and hair braids and i did n't understand why it was happening			2
obviously , i was quite upset			0
" doctors think alopecia is an autoimmune disease which causes the body to attack the hair follicles			1
genes may also play a role in the onset of the condition , which affects around 2 % of the general population			2
while the underlying causes remain a mystery , the psychological toll is well known			0
many sufferers experience bouts of depression , anxiety and social phobias			0
" as a teenage girl it was difficult because everyone cares about their looks			0
i ca n't deny that it was n't , " @entity1 admits			1
" but i was always quite determined to prove myself			0
i never wanted to shy away and say , ' oh well , i 'm just going to stay indoors and never go out			0
' i always thought i want to make the most of things , so i think it 's probably helped me			0
" it was an attitude that served her well when talent scouts from @entity103 turned up at her secondary school in @entity105 , @entity106			0
the village , located a few miles southwest of @entity108 , is better known for its commuters than its pedalers			0
but @entity1 changed all that			1
" i was n't into cycling at all			2
it was just purely by chance they came to the school and i was like , ' that sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon			0
i 'll have a go			0
' " she won her race and was invited back for more testing , which revealed the 15 - year - old possessed a good power - to - weight ratio for her age			2
from there it was on to a talent development squad before starting racing in 2005 , when she quickly made her mark by winning the 2 km pursuit at the @entity130			0
while @entity1 races professionally on the road and in time trials , it is on the track in both team pursuit and latterly individual pursuit races that she has risen to the very top of the sport			1
" individual pursuit is quite simple			0
it 's a 12 - lap race -- which is 3 km -- and there 's somebody on the opposite side of the track who you are chasing , " she explains			2
the winner is the rider who catches the other rider or , as is more frequent , the one who sets the fastest time			0
team pursuit , meanwhile , is run over 4 km with four riders ( previously three ) on each team			0
" the idea is to cover the 4 km as quickly as you can , " @entity1 says			1
" the best way to do this is to take it in turns at the front -- you save so much energy when you are behind on the wheel			0
" things have n't go too badly for @entity1 since joining the senior ranks			1
at the 2008 world championships in @entity168 ( which is also her training base ) , she won a gold medal in the women 's team pursuit alongside @entity173 and @entity174			1
she 's repeated the feat three times since , most recently at this year 's world championships in @entity178 in february			1
@entity181 's @entity180 ± o was also the scene of @entity1 's first gold medal in the individual pursuit , where she beat defending champion @entity185 of the @entity186 in the final in a personal best time			1
@entity1 will be going for more individual pursuit glory at the @entity190 in @entity191 later this month			2
she will be the hot favorite when she lines up at @entity194 's sir @entity193 -- named after the six - time @entity18 champion cyclist and the man who helped foster @entity1 's interest in the sport when she watched him race on tv at the @entity201			1
now it is the 25 - year - old @entity1 who is inspiring the next generation with her feats of bravery on and off the track			1
" i never set out to be a role model but a lot of people have told me i am , which is always nice to hear , " she says			1
" as a cyclist you are out there to win your race , but when people say that sort of thing i do feel a bit of responsibility to act in a certain way and be a good role model to younger girls			1
" but the biggest reward , perhaps , is the gift that cycling has given back to her			2
" i 'm definitely a lot more accepting of ( alopecia ) now and it 's not something i think about every day to be honest			0
i am thinking about winning the @entity18 or winning the @entity190 or the @entity228			0
" at the end of the day , i ca n't change it , i can only get on with what i 've got so i may as well carry on			0
