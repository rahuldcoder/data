@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 -- the biggest automobile exhibition in the most lucrative car market in the world -- opens tuesday amidst a flurry of @entity1 - focused global car premieres			1
meanwhile , shortages in the supply chain continue to worry car manufacturers , just one month after @entity13 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
major brands including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 are racing to win over @entity1 customers this week , slating highly anticipated global releases for @entity0 , which this year coincides with the @entity22			1
@entity23 car maker @entity19 hosted a flashy global unveiling of its new hatchback @entity26 - 5 in @entity0 because the company is convinced @entity1 's car market will continue growing dramatically in the coming years			1
" ten percent growth will last for several years , " @entity30 's ceo @entity29 told reporters monday			1
the @entity33 will be produced in @entity1 by @entity34 , which ranks fourth in the mainland			2
also this week , @entity17 will unveil its new @entity36 2013			1
@entity18 will premiere its new 6 - series luxury coupe in @entity0 , along with a concept @entity39 luxury sport sedan			1
@entity41 , a popular brand with a major market share in @entity1 , announced it will unveil a new @entity44 crossover			2
@entity45 will reveal its entry - level a-class concept car , among others			0
on monday , @entity16 unveiled @entity48 , its first dedicated car brand aimed specifically at @entity1 consumers			1
the @entity52 car brand announced that it aims to more than double the number of cars it sells in @entity1 to 5 million by 2015			2
" we have set some aggressive goals , " @entity57 head @entity56 told reporters on monday			0
" we are confident we will achieve every one of our goals			0
" the first model for @entity48 , which means " treasured horse " in @entity1 , is a mid-size 1.5 - litre engine sedan that is priced between us $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 , according to @entity56			2
it is a price point that @entity66 hopes will be attractive to young buyers in @entity1 's second - and third - tier cities			1
@entity1 's rapidly expanding car market is expected to grow even if the economy slows			2
according to the @entity75 , even if @entity1 's annual gross domestic product growth rate declines from 10 to 7 percent , as projected by the @entity73 and laid out in @entity1 's 12th five - year plan , some 600 million vehicles could fill @entity1 's roads by 2030			1
however , the announcements across @entity0 were muted by the auto industry 's continued struggle to rebound from a components shortage caused by the @entity13 's march 11 earthquake and tsunami , which caused forced factory closures			1
short supply of crucial car parts has caused some brands , including @entity87 , to temporarily half production due to shortages			0
" obviously it 's a terrible tragedy for the people of @entity13 , " @entity66 's @entity1 ceo @entity90 told @entity2 on monday			1
" it 's not just the supply base that directly supply the auto companies , but their suppliers and their supplies so it 's a complex situation that is evolving everyday			0
" @entity66 has moved up previously planned stoppages in their manufacturing facilities to project their supply of cars in certain locations			0
@entity105 , which is owned by @entity1 's @entity106 , has been forced to look elsewhere for some parts			2
" so far we have managed it very well , we had no loss of any production and no change in our model mix , " @entity105 ceo @entity108 told @entity2			0
" we have some specific components where we are relying on @entity13 but we managed together with suppliers from @entity13 to find alternatives within @entity13 but also out of other countries and other production locations abroad			0
" @entity108 predicted a new wave of semiconductor shortages will emerge this summer , affecting their ability to produce gear box control units and powertrains			0
as for the long term impact , auto manufacturers are cautiously optimistic			0
" i think @entity13 quake results are going to play out over the next several months , " @entity66 's @entity90 said			2
" it 's a critical time when suppliers are ramping back up and inventory levels have been coming down throughout the system , so over the next couple of months we 'll know the real proof of impact of what 's happening			0
" " i do n't think there will be a major long term impact , " @entity90 told @entity2			0
the 14th @entity139 opens to the media on tuesday and to the public on thursday .			0
