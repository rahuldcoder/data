-- @entity1 has played many characters on television and the big screen , but one of his most important roles in real life is fighting for veterans			1
" i have a passionate love for our country			1
i know that our freedom is provided by men and women , ordinary men and women who take up the call and serve our country , " he says			0
" we can never forget our defenders , and we should do everything we can for them before the battle , during the battle and after the battle when things get rough for them			0
we should take care of them			0
" and that 's just what the actor is doing through programs at the @entity30			1
the nonprofit helps veterans translate their military skills to civilian careers , sponsors military scholarships and even helps build customized homes for the severely wounded			1
" if you 're a quadruple amputee , you 've lost both arms and both legs , you 're going to have some physical challenges for the rest of your life			0
we want your home to be the most secure , safe , manageable place in your life , " explains @entity1			1
in partnership with @entity47 to @entity48 , homes are built with smart technology such as automated doors and @entity52 - controlled electronics			0
cpl. @entity53 , who lost both legs serving in @entity55 , is looking forward to gaining more independence after he moves into his specialized house			0
" sometimes i get so focused on the small things that are easy for you but hard for me , " the @entity58 says			0
" and now i actually have to think my way through them			0
so it 's actually very tiring mentally and just to be able to scoot through your house and do the things you need to do , whether that be laundry , you know , use the bathroom , get to a certain area of the house without actually having to put so much thought into it			1
i think it 'll be relief			0
" the @entity30 raises money for these homes by hosting concerts featuring the lt. @entity77			1
@entity1 plays bass in the group he named after his iconic character from the 1994 movie " @entity83			1
" " i never thought years ago that when i was in my 50s i 'd be playing concerts all over the world , " says the @entity85 - nominated actor			0
" it 's part of my overall mission to raise spirits , raise awareness and raise funds to support the men and women who serve our country			1
" @entity1 was a passionate supporter of the military long before he played disabled @entity99 vet lt. @entity98			1
he comes from a family of men who served			2
" my dad served in the @entity104 , my two uncles were in @entity105 , " he says			0

" @entity1 also has connections to the military through his wife , @entity113			1
her two brothers served in @entity99			0
her sister was in the @entity108 and married a @entity99 veteran			0
their son just returned from his second tour in @entity55			0
the success of " @entity83 " propelled @entity1 to advocate for the military even more			1
he went to a @entity123 convention and received an award for playing lt. @entity98			1
" i was very moved and touched by the people that i met and the actual wounded veterans from many wars prior , " he remembers			2
" but it also led me to an association with our wounded that now goes back 20 years			2
" the attacks of 9/11 reinforced @entity1 's commitment to the troops			1
" when our men and women started deploying to @entity139 and @entity55 , they started getting hurt and killed , " he somberly states			0
" @entity140 started struggling and suffering in the military			2
having @entity99 veterans in my family , remembering what happened to them when they came home , it was very troubling to think that our men and women would deploy in reaction to september 11th and come home to a nation that did n't appreciate them			2
" to show his appreciation , the actor visited service men and women all over the world through the @entity157 and provided entertainment with the lt. @entity77			1
eventually , the @entity30 was established			0
when it comes to identifying with wounded veterans , @entity53 says @entity1 just " gets it			1
" " a lot of people do n't get it			0
people do n't even know what 's going on over there or the severity of the situations that these guys come back in			2
" the double amputee adds , " they never take a chance to look up from their phone and see what 's going on around the world			2
" maybe we can take a cue from @entity1 and realize we do n't have to wear a uniform to serve our country			1
we can simply honor , remember and care for wounded veterans in our communities .			2

@entity184 serves the needs of the military community
wounded *warriors* identify with @entity1 's lt. @entity98 character from " @entity83 "
@entity1 's passionate commitment to the military stems from his family 's service
