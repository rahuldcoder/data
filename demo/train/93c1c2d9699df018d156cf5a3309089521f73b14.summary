-- is it ever acceptable to stand by and let people drown ? @entity4 leaders seem to think so ; in fact it 's their new policy			1
this week @entity7 , the search and rescue operation in the @entity9 deployed to help those who get into difficulty while trying to reach the safety of @entity13 , is due to end			1
since it began last year , the @entity15 naval operation has rescued 150,000 people from death at sea			1
tragically , it has also pulled 3,343 bodies from the waves			0
the @entity15 have now decided that @entity7 is too costly to bear alone and have asked the rest of @entity13 for help			1
but the other @entity4 governments have declined , finding it politically expedient to turn their backs on the mothers , fathers and children drowning in the @entity9			1
after all , they 're someone else 's family ; some other country 's problem			2
@entity7 will be replaced by @entity35 , run by @entity38 border agency @entity36 , from november 1			0
@entity36 has said the exclusive focus of @entity35 will be on border control			0
there will be no search and rescue function			1
the justification is a classic example of self - serving doublespeak , disingenuously expressed by the @entity47 foreign office minister @entity46 earlier this month when she told @entity47 's parliament : " we do not support planned search and rescue operations in the @entity9			1
" we believe that they create an unintended ' pull factor ' , encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths			1
" the @entity57 's contention that search and rescue operations are a pull factor is an affront to basic humanity : the suggestion is that if we allow people to drown at sea , it will deter others from setting sail			1
do liver transplants encourage people to drink more alcohol ? do seatbelts encourage dangerous driving ? the argument is as flawed as it is chilling			1
the current increase in boat journeys across the @entity9 began after @entity76 was overthrown in @entity77 , and reached a peak last summer , when @entity7 was established as a response			2
people were n't embarking then because they expected to be rescued , and it 's not why they 're embarking now			2
our leaders act as if oblivious to the fact that the world is in the grip of the greatest refugee crisis since @entity89 50 million people around the world have been forcibly displaced , with the @entity92 conflict alone spawning more than 3 million refugees			2
those fleeing atrocities will not stop seeking safety in @entity13 if we stop throwing them life rings			1
putting your life in the hands of unscrupulous people smugglers and boarding a rickety , overcrowded boat in @entity77 will remain a rational decision if your country is in flames and you 're scared for your life			2
the perversity of the @entity38 's inhumane stance is further exposed by the fact that many of those who set sail from @entity114 are granted refugee status in @entity38 if they arrive safely , as the majority are @entity92 , @entity117 or @entity118			2
we know these people are likely to need our protection , so why do we make them undertake a deadly journey before we provide it ? the answer is not higher walls around @entity13 -- it is to provide more safe and legal channels for people to access protection			1
people are forced to risk their lives in order to reach safety because they have no other choice			2
we must provide them with alternatives , and there are plenty of options			0
we could loosen restrictions on family reunification , establish temporary humanitarian admission programs and offer protected entry visas			0
or we could heed the @entity142 's call for @entity4 countries to accept more refugees for resettlement			0
the majority of the world 's refugees who flee persecution and conflict are unable to travel far beyond the borders of their home country			0
developing countries host 86 % of the world 's refugees , with thousands forced to live in refugee camps for years			2
a resettlement place is a lifeline			0
it offers the chance of sleeping in a real bed ; of ensuring children have a decent education ; of accessing running water ; of hope			0
@entity142 estimates that , today , 691,000 refugees around the world are in urgent need of resettlement			0
these people will never be able to go home , and are unable to rebuild their lives in the poor countries to which they have fled			0
currently , the number of resettlement places offered by @entity38 countries is pitiful : emergency programs aside , only 5,500 resettlement places are available annually			0
the @entity47 's contribution is a meager 750			0
@entity38 leaders must not close their eyes or turn their backs to this refugee crisis			0
more can and should be done to help			0
pulling up the drawbridge to @entity13 will only consign more desperate , scared people to death by drowning , with their bodies washing up on the beaches of @entity191			1

@entity15 's search and rescue operation for migrants crossing @entity9 to end
politicians claim it encourages more people to try and make their way to @entity13 by sea
refugee advocate @entity211 *insists* their " argument is as flawed as it is chilling "
" those fleeing atrocities will not stop seeking safety in @entity13 if we stop throwing them life rings "
