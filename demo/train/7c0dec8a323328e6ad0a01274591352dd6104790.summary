@entity1 , @entity0 -- a portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an @entity5 home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of @entity8 created during his lifetime			1
the portrait of @entity8 is thought to be the " only " portrait painted during his lifetime			1
the image reveals a wealthy shakespeare of high social status , contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status , according to @entity18 , a professor who chairs @entity1 's @entity19			2
@entity18 , a distinguished @entity8 scholar , arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610 , when @entity8 would have been 46 years old			1
" a rather young looking 46 , it has to be said , " @entity18 said			0
the @entity25 portrait -- named after the @entity5 family that owns the painting -- shows @entity8 with rosy cheeks , a full head of hair , and a reddish brown beard			2
the most common portrait of @entity8 is a gray image showing a bald @entity8 with a small mustache and beard , and bags under his eyes			0
the identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until @entity25 saw a portrait from @entity45 's @entity44			1
that painting , which fell into disfavor as a @entity8 portrait about 70 years ago , turned out to be one of four copies of @entity25 's portrait			1
the portrait " shows a man wearing expensive costuming , including a very beautifully painted ruff of @entity56 lacework which would have been very expensive , " @entity18 said			0
" it establishes , for me , that @entity8 in his later years was a rather wealthy , a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time , " @entity18 said			0
" there 's been too much of a tendency to believe that @entity8 , being the son of a glover , coming for a small town in the middle of @entity0 , that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life			0
" @entity18 reads even more into what he sees in @entity8 's newly - found face			2
" i think it 's plausible as a portrait as a good listener , of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays , clearly the face of a man of high intelligence , " he said			0
" it 's the face of a man , i think , who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features			0
but , of course , as somebody ( @entity87 ) says in @entity8 's story @entity89 , ' there 's no art to find the mind 's construction in the face			2
' " it should be noted that @entity8 's @entity87 paid a price for judging @entity89 to have the face of an honorable man			1

the public can read @entity8 's face from the original painting at @entity19 in @entity103 where it goes on display for several months starting april 23			1
the portrait then returns to the @entity107 , which inherited it when an ancestor married @entity0 's @entity111 -- a friend of @entity8 who likely commissioned its painting .			1
