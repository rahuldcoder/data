-- @entity2 's @entity1 arrived in @entity3 tuesday for a two - day diamond jubilee visit during which she will shake hands with a former @entity7 commander , @entity6 , in a highly symbolic gesture			1
she will meet @entity6 , now a @entity10 politician and the deputy first minister of @entity3 , at an arts event in @entity13 wednesday			1
the meeting is a sign of the significant easing of tensions in @entity2 - @entity19 relations since the @entity21 peace deal was signed in 1998			0
@entity23 's president @entity22 will attend the same event			0
on tuesday , the queen was greeted in @entity26 -- the scene of a deadly @entity7 bombing in 1987 -- by crowds lining the streets and waving @entity32 flags			1
she was greeted by secretary of state for northern ireland @entity33 , who accompanied her to a jubilee thanksgiving service at @entity36 , an @entity38 church , that was attended by more than 700 people			0
she also went to a smaller service at @entity41 in @entity26 , a catholic church			2
friday 's confirmation that the queen would meet @entity6 prompted wide reaction in the @entity2 media			1
it follows the queen 's visit to the @entity23 in may of last year , which was seen as ushering in a new era in relations			0
the meeting has an added significance for the queen because one of her relatives , @entity55 , was killed by an @entity7 bomb in 1979			1
@entity7 members have also killed police officers and soldiers in @entity3 , who serve in the queen 's name			1
the nationalist community in @entity3 sees the @entity2 as occupiers and wants their rule in the province to end			2
@entity10 president @entity69 acknowledged the controversial nature of the handshake in a statement friday			2
" because this involves @entity6 meeting the @entity2 monarch , this will cause difficulty for @entity77 and nationalists who have suffered at the hands of @entity2 forces in @entity3 over many decades , " he said			1
however , he said , the party had agreed that @entity6 should meet the queen " in the context of conflict resolution and national reconciliation , as well as our own republican national objectives			1
" the event is not connected with the queen 's diamond jubilee celebrations , he said			0
" this is a significant initiative involving major political and symbolic challenges for @entity19 republicans , " @entity69 added			0
" as the record of the peace process demonstrates , @entity19 republicans have frequently been prepared to take bold and historic initiatives and risks for peace to break stalemates and find agreements			0
" the @entity1 's 2011 visit to @entity3 was the first by a @entity2 monarch to the republic since it gained independence in 1921 and marked a reconciliation between neighboring countries , which once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility			1
@entity6 has admitted that he was a leader of the @entity7 during the 30 - year conflict in @entity3 between @entity112 and @entity113 forces			1
in recent years , he has received death threats from hardline dissident @entity7 splinter groups because of his support for the peace process			2
the majority of the island gained independence in 1921 , following two years of conflict , but six of the nine counties of the province of @entity125 chose to stay in the @entity2 , eventually becoming the country of @entity3			2
in the late 1960s the conflict between mainly @entity129 unionists who want @entity3 to remain part of the @entity2 and largely @entity133 nationalists who want the @entity134 to be reunited with the rest of @entity3 exploded into a political and sectarian war , known as the @entity137			0
the three decades of ensuing violence between the @entity7 and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people , most of them north of the border , and while the @entity144 of 1998 effectively ended the conflict , suspicions remain			0
under the terms of the landmark accord , terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons , and political allies of the two now work together in @entity3 's power - sharing government			0
