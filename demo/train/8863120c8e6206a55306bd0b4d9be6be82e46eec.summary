" it is concerning at a time when you have a gender gap that put ( @entity11 ) over the top , and that gap was a diverse gender gap , " @entity37 said			2

@entity11 's @entity70 : who 's in , who 's out ? others candidates , such as @entity74 , who served as undersecretary of defense , and @entity77 , an undersecretary at the @entity79 , were bypassed in favor of @entity81 and @entity12 , respectively			1
moreover , there are more men than women among names being considered for other @entity70 positions in @entity11 's second term			1

while @entity11 's record on diversity is also better than the much - discussed 20 % female representation in the @entity147 , he would have to appoint more women to match @entity60 's record			1
women represented 41 % of his cabinet in his second term			2

" nobody believes there 's any overt discrimination , " @entity158 said pointing at women who occupy top posts in the @entity11 administration			1
" defense and @entity79 : those are male - dominated issues and frontiers , and those are the areas where woman still have to shore up their credentials and prove themselves more , " @entity158 said			0
" we 've reached a point in time where the @entity70 have become increasingly diverse			0

@entity11 's second term cabinet picks include @entity12 , @entity25 and @entity30
some worry the trend will derail the president 's previous track record of diversity
defense and treasury @entity70 spots still a glass *ceiling* for women
