@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are more elephants in @entity1 than @entity5			1
five of the rare @entity5 are in a @entity8 class in the @entity9 , which occupies a portion of a red residential building in south @entity0			2
the class has just been disrupted by me with a weird question			0
all the five mormons are adolescent girls , almost modern at first glance in jeans and skirts and t - shirts			0
for some reason the question has made them burst into giggles and to make eyes at each other			0
only one of the girls knows the answer			0
" @entity29 is a presidential candidate , " she says in a mumble			0
others nod to indicate that the name is now familiar			0
but they look surprised when they are told he is a @entity5			0
in this church , as in the rest of @entity0 , there has been very little interest in the @entity38 presidential primaries			1
in the last several months , the @entity1 media has been joyously preoccupied with substantial domestic scams , scandals and political tremors			1
even after @entity29 emerged as @entity44 's challenger , the @entity1 media has viewed the presidential battle as peripheral news			1
@entity48 postcard : enjoying the @entity38 political " matsuri " no doubt , as the campaign escalates , the @entity38 election will become the predominant news in @entity1 but for now it is not a popular topic of discussion			1
in @entity60 's @entity59 restaurant , an upper middle - class family of about 30 people has arrived to consume the buffet and celebrate the birthday of a woman who is a doctor trained in both @entity65 medicine and homeopathy			2
( almost every @entity0 family has at least one loveable homeopath , usually a woman , who will diagnose the ailing relative over the phone and home - deliver the sugar pills			1
) an elder lights up a cigarette even though it is against the law to smoke in any of @entity0 's restaurants			1
the waiter pretends that he has not seen it because he knows he will be abused if he tried to stop			0
the young , many of whom have studied in @entity38 , flock together and chat about an impending wedding in the family			2
they are very aware of @entity38 politics , and they admire @entity44 , but the elections do not interest them yet , probably because the media is yet to show them the way			1
but one of them , who is an executive with a healthcare firm , is interested			0
" i ca n't stand @entity1 news channels anymore , " he says , " they have no news			2
they just scream all the time			0
so i have started watching @entity2 and @entity100			0
so i ca n't help it , i follow the @entity38 elections			2
" @entity103 postcard : marvelling at @entity44 's " coolitude " you ask a crowd of this type , the young especially , who they would like to see as the next @entity38 president , and their answer will be unambiguous -- @entity44			1
for them , the @entity38 presidential election is somehow a war between good and evil			1
@entity118 are good , liberal and very @entity119 and @entity120			0
@entity121 are evil , too @entity122 and @entity123			2
but the scholarly view in @entity0 has long been different : democrats may be handsome and clever , but @entity121 presidents suit @entity1 better			1
not surprisingly , last month , an editorial comment in the largest @entity129 newspaper in @entity1 , @entity130 , announced : " @entity44 's got a bee in his bonnet about @entity1 - the current president does go on a bit about @entity1 being , ahem , a threat to @entity38 professionals , @entity1 children studying maths earnestly while the @entity135 doodle their days away , the @entity38 getting ' bangalored ' , supposedly losing jobs to harder - working @entity1			1
to charge his people into action @entity44 's not above reviving the @entity144 spectre once again , targeting this time the @entity145 rather than the @entity146			1
in contrast , @entity29 does n't say much anyway - and when he does speak , it 's not about @entity1			1
surely that 's a blessing			0
traditionally too , the @entity121 leadership does n't care overly much about kid stuff like school grades - their business is with business , so a @entity29 in the @entity156 might mean more dollars for @entity0			1
but then , there 's a flip side - we may need to learn robot language			2
" for @entity1 , the elimination of @entity163 last year by @entity164 was as significant as where he was found -- in a mansion in the heart of @entity168 , in the happy company of his large family , including a wife who has been frequently described as " young			2
" the subsequent collapse of the arranged marriage between @entity44 's administration and @entity168 's military leadership , is viewed in @entity0 as a good development for @entity1 's security			1
yet the general perception in the capital is that @entity121 will be tougher on @entity168 than the @entity118			0
it is a view that will be repeated many times this year by political experts in the newspapers , on chat shows and in the nocturnal congregations of journalists and think - tank scholars , of whom there are many in @entity0			2
but even they will find it hard to deny their love for @entity44 , the articulate non-white from @entity194			1
it is an affection they share with the capital 's powerful , including politicians			0
when @entity44 visited @entity1 for the very first time , in 2010 , a senior politician personally supervised the design of the new uniform that the @entity204 's security officers were to wear , and she also briefed the members of the parliament how they should behave in @entity44 's presence so that they looked elegant			1
( there was a near stampede when @entity210 had visited in 2000 and it was all very embarrassing			0
) @entity212 postcard : a cynical eye on the @entity38 election @entity1 look at the two - party system of @entity38 with the ache of longing			1
@entity1 national elections , which are due in 2014 , unless the government lead by the @entity220 falls before its time , is a festive circus of dozens of parties , most of which are actually family businesses which will be transferred by the elders to their children			2
there is probably not a single political journalist in the country who can name , without looking at reference material , all the political parties that contest in the national elections			0
but there are some similarities between the @entity38 system and the two major political rivals of @entity1			1
the @entity220 has overt and covert socialist tendencies			0
it is willing to help the poor at the expense of the middleclass			0
the party is , in theory , liberal			0
in fact , it has interpreted secularism to mean equal opportunity for thugs from all religions			0
the other major party , the opposition @entity253 , is largely a conservative , capitalist , middle - class force that is often baffled over why it is so hard for people to accept that @entity1 is fundamentally a @entity258 country			1
there must be something about human nature that divides the species into @entity118 and @entity121 .			0

many admire @entity44 , but @entity0 *academics* say @entity121 presidents are better for @entity1
regardless of the *outcome* , @entity268 says @entity1 *envies* @entity38 's two - party system
@entity268 says @entity1 media will find it hard to deny their love of @entity44 in lead - up to election
