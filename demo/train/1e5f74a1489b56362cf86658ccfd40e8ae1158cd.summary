an @entity1 man died last weekend in @entity2 while fighting for @entity3 , the latest evidence of the reach of a terror group that 's become increasingly powerful and feared in the eyes of @entity1			1
@entity8 , 33 , died in a battle between rival extremist groups in the suburbs of @entity12 , @entity2 's once - bustling commercial capital and largest city , according to the @entity14 , a @entity15 - based group that monitors the conflict			1
the man 's uncle , @entity17 , said that his nephew had gone to fight as a jihadi and that the @entity21 told the family monday about the death			0
like @entity1 officials , the group characterized @entity8 as an @entity3 fighter and said he was killed battling @entity27 , an @entity28 - linked organization that the @entity1 government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization			1
@entity8 was not the first @entity1 to fight alongside militants in @entity2			1
attorney general @entity32 estimated this summer that there are 7,000 foreign fighters in the war - ravaged @entity36 nation			1
more than 100 @entity1 are among those who have tried to join various militant groups in @entity2 , @entity1 officials say			1
while some are aligned with @entity3 , the fighters shift allegiance and it 's difficult to pin down a specific number , officials say			1
@entity1 : jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in @entity46 nor was @entity8 the first of these @entity1 militants to die in @entity2			1
islamists touted the role of a 22 - year - old man -- identified by @entity21 spokeswoman @entity52 as @entity53 , who grew up and went to school in @entity46 -- in a northern @entity2 suicide bombing conducted in coordination with @entity27			0
yet @entity8 's death takes on added significance , perhaps urgency , given that he 's believed to be the first @entity1 killed while fighting with @entity3			1
until now , @entity60 largely has limited its involvement in @entity2 to diplomatic efforts and supporting " moderate opposition , " as described by @entity64 chairman @entity65 and others , that is fighting to unseat @entity2 president @entity67			0
that 's the same goal as @entity3 , which aims to rule a caliphate , known as the @entity70 , spanning @entity71 and @entity2			1
even so , the @entity1 initiated airstrikes against @entity3 in @entity71 this month and signaled that it might next go after the group inside @entity2			1
and it has begun gathering intelligence on @entity3 in @entity2 , potentially ahead of more airstrikes there			2
@entity3 has threatened to kill more americans if the @entity1 continues to go after it			2
but the fact @entity8 was among its ranks adds another fear : that the group includes other @entity1 who , rather than dying on the battlefield , might inflict harm stateside			2
" there 's real concern that they could take what they 've learned ... come back home and conduct terror attacks , " @entity85 spokesman rear adm. @entity84 told @entity86			0
" so i think ( @entity8 ) is a stark reminder of the inside threat that foreign fighters ( in @entity3 ) can pose			1
" official : @entity98 weighing options against @entity3 in @entity2 who was @entity101 ? @entity102 was immediately known publicly about @entity8 's life , beyond how it ended			1
he attended @entity105 , though its spokesman @entity106 would not say when @entity8 attended , for how long or for what purpose			0
several years ago , according to his uncle , @entity8 converted from @entity109 to @entity110 -- the first step on his journey to @entity2			1
the family was n't alarmed by his conversion , but his @entity116 posts sympathetic to @entity3 got their attention			1
when they last heard from him several months ago , @entity8 said he was traveling to @entity119 , according to his uncle			2
the fact that @entity8 became a jihadi left his family " devastated " and " just as surprised as the country , " said @entity17 , who lives in @entity124			2
he described the nephew he knew as " a good person , loved his family , loved his mother , loved his faith " -- the latter being a reference to the @entity109 he practiced before his conversion			0
@entity1 counterterrorism investigators had been looking into @entity8 's activities for some time before his death , one @entity1 official said			1
he was on a list of @entity1 who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled , according to the official			2
gen. @entity141 , who had top roles in the @entity143 in president @entity145 's administration , said he expects more stories like @entity8 's			0
" the ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are , " @entity141 said			0
" i think we need to understand that there 's going to be more of this rather than less of this			0
" @entity155 man arrested , wanted to join @entity3 fears over @entity157 in terror groups @entity2 's civil war has been brewing for three years			1
in the absence of a unified rebel front , many groups -- some moderate , some more secular , some extremist -- have tried to fill the void			0
much of the time , they 've battled @entity67 's forces , though there has also been infighting among them			0
among these rebel groups , one has emerged recently in the public 's consciousness : @entity3			0
that 's as much due to its brazenness and viciousness as to its success			0
the general command for @entity28 -- itself responsible for the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- went so far as to disown @entity3 and blame it for " the enormity of the disaster that afflicted the @entity181 in @entity2			2
" who is @entity3 ? yet the group has thrived			0
it has taken more and more territory in @entity71 and @entity2 , sometimes overrunning government forces while terrorizing civilians			0
@entity3 's stature grew even more internationally with the recent beheading of @entity1 journalist @entity189 , a killing it videotaped and then put online			2
" they are beyond just a terrorist group , " defense secretary @entity190 said last week			0
" they marry ideology , a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
" this is beyond anything we have seen , and we must prepare for everything			0
" these preparations include tracking westerners like @entity8			0
in addition to whatever they might do against allies and civilians in the @entity36 , @entity1 officials worry that they could bring their groups ' brand of terror back home			1
assistant attorney general @entity212 said last month that getting intelligence on such @entity1 who fight in @entity2 and making sure they do n't bring that right back home is " a top priority			2
" " we have increased our capacity , we have increased our tracking , we have increased our coordination , " @entity52 said			0
" ... this is a threat that we take seriously enough to put it at the front and center of our agenda			2
" man arrested after overseas trip , accused of sympathizing with @entity3 opinion : @entity3 : is it really a threat to the @entity1 ?			1

more than 100 @entity1 have tried to join militants in @entity2 , @entity1 officials say
@entity85 official : @entity8 " a stark reminder of the inside threat ( from ) foreign fighters "
@entity1 official : threat of jihadis returning to @entity1 " front and center of our agenda "
