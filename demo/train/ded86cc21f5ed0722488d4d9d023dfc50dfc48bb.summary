-- @entity3 tanks and helicopters opened fire and killed at least two civilians as the military advanced through a series of villages in northwestern @entity3 thursday , a push that sent residents running for the hills , a villager told @entity0			1
" they attacked the old church , " said @entity13 , a farmer who fled his home and spoke to @entity0 from the hills around @entity16			0
" we are calling on international organizations to protect our ruins			0
they are destroying our cultural heritage			0
" @entity3 has been engulfed in violence during more than three months of anti-government discontent			1
the crackdown on anti-government protests in the @entity29 region of @entity3 's @entity31 province comes just days after @entity3 authorities allowed a historic opposition conference to be held in the capital , @entity35			1
helicopters swept in and dropped commandos into the area from ropes thursday morning			0
tanks and helicopters bombarded ancient @entity43 ruins in @entity16 , the site of a famous " dead city , " a destination for tourists fascinated by fifth - century @entity43 churches , monasteries , and an intact pyramid - shaped burial chamber			2
@entity13 also said @entity3 military units attacked and destroyed the home of a local man named @entity54 , killing him and his infant son			1
" his 1 - year - old son , named @entity58 , was in the house and we could n't save him , " @entity13 said			0
@entity13 said @entity3 troops and plain - clothed @entity63 militants had blocked escape routes to nearby @entity65			1
@entity0 could not independently confirm the man 's account			0
the number of @entity3 refugees fleeing to @entity65 each day has dropped dramatically as @entity3 troops have moved into border regions , after days of protests and unrest			1
the @entity65 prime minister 's office released a statement thursday saying that five @entity3 refugees had crossed the border during the prior 24 hours			1
more than 15,000 @entity3 refugees fled to @entity65 to escape the government crackdown in recent weeks			1
nearly a third of those refugees have voluntarily returned to @entity3 in recent days , according to the @entity65 government			1
elsewhere , in the large city of @entity84 , 20 busloads of what an activist called " government thugs " attacked marchers with batons and knives			1
the attack caused the demonstrators to disperse , and a number of people were injured , but there was no word of deaths			0
@entity99 surfaced on the internet of what activists say was unrest on @entity104 in @entity84 , and it showed a panicked crowd fleeing down the street			1
@entity3 forces later intervened , pushed the " thugs " back , and a peaceful demonstration ensued , an activist said			1
another activist , contacted by telephone by @entity0 , said the street was the site of a thursday confrontation between protesters and government forces			2
@entity118 , of the @entity120 - based @entity119 , said anti-regime demonstrations occurred thursday in @entity84 's @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 neighborhoods			1
hundreds of demonstrators participated in them , he said			0
some pro-regime demonstrations occurred in the same areas , with demonstrators clashing and a number of injuries resulting , he said			0
at the @entity134 , @entity133 diplomats exchanged harsh words with the @entity3 ambassador in the @entity137 , where @entity138 and @entity139 have threatened to veto a pending resolution condemning the violence in @entity3 on the grounds that they do not want to get involved in @entity3 's internal affairs			1
" this council should send a clear message underlining our collective concern , " said @entity144 , @entity145 's deputy ambassador to the @entity134			1
" they have met legitimate demands for reform with brute force			0
" " i would hope that this esteemed council would focus on the real issues instead of meddling in internal affairs , " said @entity154 , @entity3 's ambassador to the world body			2
" some member states will not cease to use the @entity137 as a tool to pass its own policies			0
" meanwhile , an @entity163 congressman who traveled this week to @entity3 , where he met with president @entity164 and opposition leaders , said the situation is " dire			1
" @entity163 rep. @entity167 , @entity168 , said he is working to end the violence			2
" i appealed to president @entity164 to remove his forces from the cities			0
he told me he would , and today we learned that he has begun to do just that			0
" " a process of national dialogue is now beginning			0
this process is unprecedented in @entity3 and should not be dismissed as mere window dressing , because until now there has been no window for people to view what democracy in @entity3 would look like			2
" he said he has talked to " many @entity3 who said the overthrow of @entity164 -- without knowing who would take his place -- will add to the instability and make things immeasurably worse , and they want him to deliver on the reforms			2
" " president @entity164 has communicated directly to the opposition , and to me personally , that he is prepared to do that , not as a ruse to stay in power , but as a step towards the natural path to @entity3 's progress and development			2
we must be mindful however of the actions of extremists who are using this time of transition as an opportunity of cover for their own anti-democratic agenda			0
" @entity167 said he traveled to @entity3 at the request of his @entity211 - @entity163 constituents and not in response to an invitation from @entity35			1
he met with government and opposition figures , including people who had been imprisoned by the regime , and said the situation does n't " simply involve two players : the government and the opposition			2
" " it is an extremely complicated and explosive condition involving , among other elements , a historically closed government with an awful human rights record , caught up in demands for democracy sweeping the region ; security forces which went out of control killing innocent protesters ; sectarian interests which have longed to overthrow a government which has protected religious minorities ; violence against minorities ; guns flowing across the borders with refugees on the move , " he said			0
" too many people have already died in @entity3			2
it is imperative to act to end further deaths			0
" @entity0 's @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report			0
