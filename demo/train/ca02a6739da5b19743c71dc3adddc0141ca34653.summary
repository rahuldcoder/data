-- we do n't agree often			2
in fact , for most of our adult lives , we have worked on opposite ends of the political spectrum			0
one of us headed the fastest - growing union in @entity7 , the other served as budget director for arguably the most important @entity11 president in the modern era , @entity10			1
but national crises make for strange bedfellows			0
that 's why we are asking @entity16 and @entity11 to put aside their partisan interests to secure @entity7 's future by passing a deficit reduction plan of at least $ 4 trillion that includes both spending cuts and new revenues			1
our debt crisis is so severe , so obvious , and the middle ground seemingly so apparent , even odd couple characters @entity23 and @entity25 could agree on a solution			1
so why ca n't @entity27 and the president ? if we can do it , so can they			1
we agree with republicans who note that we have a serious spending problem			2
health care costs are growing out of control and government wastes money on programs that duplicate other programs or are just unnecessary			0
in 2010 , federal spending was nearly 24 % of gross domestic product , the value of all goods and services produced in the economy			2
only during @entity44 was federal spending a larger part of the economy			0
and we also agree with @entity16 that taxes must be part of the plan			1
tax revenues stood at 15 % of gdp last year , the lowest level since 1950			0
and even when the economy finally turns around , by 2025 the federal government will have only enough revenue to finance interest payments , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			2
our tax system is broken			0
we simply do n't raise enough revenue to pay the bills for the level of government that an overwhelming bipartisan majority has consistently supported			2
this country needs a deal			0
we need to fix our busted budget system , revamp our broken tax code and reform our @entity60 and health care programs so that citizens who depend on them can count on them			2
we also need to ensure our country is safe and secure , but at a significantly lower cost than today 's bloated defense budget			1
we can only do that by passing a comprehensive fiscal plan , like those put forward by the @entity80 and the @entity81 , which phases in the changes , contains real cuts that fix our mounting national debt problem and erases the uncertainty that afflicts businesses and other governments who hold our debt			1
this last point can not be emphasized enough			0
businesses know that spending cuts and tax increases are coming , but they do not know how , when or even why			1
without a concrete fiscal game plan that provides some measure of certainty , confidence will remain weak and economic recovery tepid			1
worse still , if we simply continue to kick the can down the road , we are running the risk of a jarring financial market crisis that will make it even harder to reach consensus and the ultimate tax and spending changes even more draconian			0
a deal can happen only if both sides put everything on the table			0
that means @entity16 have to agree to entitlement reform and cuts to domestic programs , and @entity11 have to accept more revenue and defense cuts			1
odd couples , strange bedfellows , whatever the terminology , agreeing on budget issues should not be this difficult			0
the two of us have come together despite our wide philosophical differences because we agree on one fundamental point : the fiscal crisis is so urgent that everything must be on the table			1
we need to act now			0
if the president and @entity27 embrace that principle , we can finally make some progress in getting our fiscal house in order and our national economy back on track			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers differ widely in politics ; one headed a union , the other was @entity10 's budget director
but they agree @entity27 must put aside differences , pass deficit reduction plan of $ 4 trillion
they say budget must contain domestic program and defense cuts , new revenue
writers : businesses , other governments who hold our debt need confidence in the @entity160
