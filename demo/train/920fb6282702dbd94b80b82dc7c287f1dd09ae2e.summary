-- @entity2 science - fiction series " @entity10 " originally premiered in 1963 , enticing viewers with its depiction of a time traveler known as the doctor who explores the universe in a spaceship called the tardis			1
the series has since aired 33 seasons and nearly 800 episodes with 11 actors portraying the doctor over time			1
@entity16 , the 11th doctor , set off a bit of frenzied speculation last month when he announced he 'll be leaving the show			1
the @entity2 has said it will debut a new doctor in a @entity22 special			1
as fans eagerly await the new appointment of the good doctor , the network will celebrate " @entity10 's " 50th anniversary with a biopic film about the show 's origins			1
" @entity36 " will premiere later this year ( the air date has n't been announced ) and fictionally recounts the creation of series while exploring the team behind its first episode			1
" @entity39 " tv series creator and actor @entity37 wrote the script , and " @entity43 " actor @entity42 stars as @entity44 , the actor who played the first doctor			1
to boldly go on a nerdy pilgrimage @entity37 and @entity42 appeared at the recent @entity47 in @entity48 to promote the upcoming film and spoke with @entity0 on the red carpet for a party for " @entity52 , " which also stars @entity42			1
the motivation behind the " @entity10 " film , directed by @entity56 , is to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the popular series and to depict what @entity37 says is an interesting story			1
@entity37 says that he 's a lifelong " @entity10 " fan and that he first tried to make the film on the 40th anniversary but ran into some difficulty as the series had not yet returned to the air			1
fans know and love the story of how the show was created , he said , and he wanted to share it with them			0
" it 's a remarkable bunch of people , all of them misfits really , " @entity37 said			1
" they cast as the doctor @entity44 , who had been typecast before that , and he got this role that totally changed his life			1
there 's all sort of wonderful incidental details that made the show what it is today			2
it 's a very moving story but broadly very celebrational			2
it 's lovely to turn back and see how something you love took its first steps			2
" @entity44 had appeared in various plays and films before being cast as the first doctor , the role for which he is largely remembered			2
the film explores the life of the original " @entity10 " star as much as it does the series			1
take a bite - size tour of @entity47 in portraying @entity44 , @entity42 said he immersed himself in the early episodes			0
" i wanted to see as much as i could to play him , " @entity42 said			0
" and of course in the film , we recreated a lot of the very first episode			2
not only the first episode but the first pilot that was rejected			0
" @entity42 said he was fascinated by watching @entity44 develop the character			0
" he realized he was playing it too grumpy and authoritarian and lacking in humor , " @entity42 said			0
" i think as it went on he grew to love the part and felt ownership for it			0
" " @entity36 " is meant to be enjoyed by those who do n't regularly follow the lengthy tv series or understand its extensive mythology , he said			2
" it stands alone , " @entity42 said			0
" it 's a very complex piece about lots of very interesting people			2
" @entity37 added , " that was my intention from the beginning			0
a lot of the films i admire the most , in terms of biographical films , succeed because you get involved with the person 's story , not because you know all the things			2
" part of " @entity10 's " premise is that the doctor can regenerate his body when he nears death			1
the concept explains the rotating actors who have portrayed him throughout the years			0
actress @entity143 ' during a @entity47 panel about the film and the show 's 50th anniversary , the creators confirmed the casting of the next doctor has not been solidified			1
" @entity36 , " which is likely to premiere this fall on the @entity2 , will give fans an opportunity to see new content before the new doctor is revealed in the @entity22 special			0
" @entity10 " has been a seminal tv series , particularly in the @entity155 , and @entity37 says he feels it may be because the character and premise are fundamentally unique			1
" it 's a great idea , and there are n't many of those around , " @entity37 says			0
" but i think one thing is very important to say -- the doctor is a television original			0
he 's not based on a literary character			0
it 's a character created by people in television for television , and it 's still going strong 50 years later			0
that 's very , very special			0

" @entity10 " will get a new doctor soon
a biopic film will also celebrate the series ' 50th anniversary
@entity180 's *scriptwriter* says the series is beloved because it 's so unique
