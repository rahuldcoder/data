@entity0 to gauge @entity3 's impact on @entity5 politics , try to imagine a presidential election without him			1
the last time that happened was in 1996 when @entity8 faced off against @entity9			0
" @entity12 " host 's hordes of millennial fans and political junkies will soon find out what a sans - @entity3 election is like as they pick their way through the spin , obfuscations and outrages of the 2016 race without him			1
@entity3 , sometimes known as " @entity23 in @entity24 , " made the surprising announcement on tuesday that he would quit the @entity26 hit before the end of the year after 16 years behind his desk			1
in a slice of irony almost too delicious to be true , news of the fake newsman 's retirement emerged at the same time as a real newsman , @entity34 , was suspended by @entity35 for six months after reports of his exaggerated war stories came to light			1
over the years , @entity3 has carved out a unique place at the intersection of politics , entertainment and journalism , offering a mocking take on the news with his whiplash humor and pseudo anchorman 's persona			1
@entity3 's grillings of politicians are legendary			1
candidates who go on his show endure an unpredictable , high wire rite of passage and the host 's sharp tongue -- all in pursuit of the young voters who form his core audience			0
it 's been repeated so often that it 's now a cliche			0
but plenty of studies show that many young @entity5 get their political news not from tv networks or newspapers but from @entity3 's biting satire			1
in a 2012 survey , the @entity70 found that 39 % of " @entity12 's " regular viewers were between 18 and 29 , but the group makes up just 23 % of the public as a whole			0
that is a demographic politicians kill for			0
and it explains why those running for office -- particularly @entity79 keen to connect with @entity3 's urban , left - leaning audience -- brave appearing on his show			1
though @entity3 frequently denies his program is a news show and is merely about entertainment , his work appears to serve much the same function as traditional network news shows			1
his dissection of issues and forensic dismissal of political hypocrisy perform much the same roles as fact checkers in traditional media			0
another survey in 2007 showed that @entity5 who knew most about what was going on in the world also tended to be viewers of " @entity12 " and its recently shuttered @entity26 spin off " @entity100			0
" @entity3 has been a constant guide for a certain segment of @entity5 throughout the tumultuous decade - and - a - half that has opened the @entity104 , filtering events and curating opinion			1
in moments of farce , like the 2000 election , or instances of tragedy , such as the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , and subsequent political races , @entity3 was there surfing the zeitgeist and resetting conventional media wisdom			1
when @entity117 had the 2000 election handed to him by the @entity119 , @entity3 voiced the frustrations of many liberals who thought the election was stolen			1
" i was not elected to serve one party " a young - looking @entity3 showed @entity117 in a clip saying , before adding " you were not elected ! " a year later , @entity3 helped teach @entity5 to laugh again in the harrowing weeks after the terror attacks			1
on his first show back after 9/11 , @entity3 replaced his normally sardonic opening segment with a moving monologue about the impact of the tragedy on his beloved @entity132			1
" we are going to get back to this			0
it is going to be fun and it is going to be funny , " he sniffed through tears			0
when the @entity139 war turned into a quagmire , @entity3 turned his searing wit on the @entity117 administration 's missteps and failures of the occupation with his long - running " @entity147 " segment			1
his daily lambasting of top @entity117 aides reflected and helped to shape the fast souring public mood on the war , which eventually provided the conditions for the rise of anti-war candidate @entity153 in 2008			0
@entity153 , who revolutionized campaigning with his use of @entity155 , social media and new digital technologies and @entity3 -- with his easily sharable segments which popped perfectly for emerging media sources like @entity160 -- might have been made for one another			1
young voters were vital for @entity153 's hopes of beating the @entity165 machine in 2008			0
and he knew where to find them -- on @entity3 's show			1
" @entity12 , " under the guise of humor and satire , also allowed @entity153 to gently deal with fiercely divisive campaign issues that were off limits or were difficult to handle on regular news shows			0
in a 2008 @entity153 appearance before the @entity177 primary , for instance , @entity3 took on the latent racism that many @entity79 thought was hampering the senator in the state and elsewhere			1
" i am going to cut through the spin for you , sir , that 's what i am here for , " @entity3 told a laughing @entity153			1
" we are concerned that ultimately at the end of the day ...			0
if you are fortunate enough to become the president of the @entity5 , will you pull a bait and switch , sir , and enslave the white race ? " in 2010 , @entity153 was back on the show days before the midterm elections in what was seen as a transparent attempt to reconnect with the young voters who powered his 2008 campaign but had since soured			0
@entity153 , the first sitting @entity5 president to appear on " @entity12 , " may have got more than he bargained for when @entity3 mocked him as a shadow of his 2008 persona after he hit gridlock in @entity0			2
" you would n't say ' yes we can , with certain conditions , ' " @entity3 quipped , to @entity153 's evident discomfort			2
@entity153 often felt the lash of @entity3 's tongue , most often when he fell short of the high expectations he raised in 2008			2
in 2013 , @entity3 ripped the president for what he thought was his dismissive response to perceived scandals in the @entity212 and over the death of a @entity5 diplomat in @entity215			2
" i would n't be surprised if president @entity153 learned @entity216 had been killed when he saw himself announce it on television , " @entity3 joked			2
more recently , @entity3 slammed @entity153 for not showing up to a march in @entity220 to honor victims of those killed by @entity224 extremists on an attack on the satirical magazine @entity226			2
" how could the @entity5 not be there ? " @entity3 asked			2
but despite the critiques of @entity153 , @entity3 has his own critics , including @entity229 who complain he favors @entity79 too openly , and some pro-israel groups , who have complained at his coverage of the jewish state			2
it is not only politicians who have felt @entity3 's mockery			2
the media gets it in the neck too			0
@entity240 and its perceived conservative bias has been a target on @entity3 's show for years			1
one of @entity3 's most well - remembered skits was his merciless takedown of conservative commentator @entity246 , complete with glasses and fake blackboard			1
in 2010 , @entity3 mocked dueling protest marches engineered by @entity246 and civil rights campaigner @entity250 and drew more than 200,000 people to @entity0 's @entity252 with the " @entity253 " with his @entity26 partner @entity254			2
@entity3 's ire often was directed at the state of political journalism itself -- and the way news shows tend to play off a conservative and a liberal pudits on opposite sides and call it balanced news coverage			1
@entity1 was n't immune from his attention			0
@entity3 famously came on the @entity1 show " @entity266 " in 2004 to skewer hosts @entity267 and @entity269			2
" you 're partisan , what do you call it ... hacks , " said @entity3			0
" stop hurting @entity5 , " he blasted in an appearance on the set			0
@entity3 , who took a sabbatical from his show in 2013 to direct a movie , appeared to foreshadow his departure from the " @entity12 " late last year in an interview with " @entity282 " host @entity281 on @entity283			0
" i do feel like i do n't know there will ever be anything that i will be as well suited for as this show , " @entity3 said			0
" that being said , there are moments when you realize that is not enough anymore			0
the minute i say i am not going to do it any more , i will miss it like crazy			0
" @entity3 's fans , not least those in politics , are already feeling the same about him .			0

@entity3 *hanging* up *mic* after 16 years
he carved out unique role at intersection of real and fake news
