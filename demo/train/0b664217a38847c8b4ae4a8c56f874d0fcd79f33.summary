the northern @entity1 city of @entity2 was both panicked and intrigued by a leopard on the loose on sunday , which has eluded captors since			1
the big cat was found in a local timber shop before being cornered in a nearby hospital , local forest official @entity6 told @entity10 on tuesday			1
animal control experts were called to tranquilize the animal , which made a daring escape , breaking a window in the room to make its getaway			1
after breaking out of the hospital it went into a cinema and later also entered an apartment block			1
stunning photographs purport to show the leopard leaping across rooftops , squeezing through a hole in the wall of the @entity26 , and snarling at a baton - wielding official through a window			1
crowds complicate capture efforts the cat sparked more inquisitiveness than trepidation as onlookers crowded around the site of the cat 's incarceration , hampering efforts by the authorities to capture and release the leopard			1
" it got agitated and escaped , " @entity6 said			0
but curiosity got the better of some in the crowd			0
seven people were injured by the leopard , including a policeman who needed treatment for a gash on the shoulder			0
no sightings were confirmed on monday and @entity6 did not rule out the possibility the leopard had retreated into the forests			1
" nothing happened ( monday )			0
so , there are chances it could have gone back to the forests			0
but we are still trying to track it , " @entity6 said			0
leopard suspected of eating 15 people in @entity61 human encroachment the incident is the latest in a series of big cat attacks in @entity1 , including at least one alleged man - eater , also in @entity67 , home to one of the world 's last remaining tiger habitats			1
a leopard also mauled a 5 - year - old boy to death in the eastern state of @entity75 last week			2
the increasing number of sightings -- and attacks -- by big cats in @entity1 is raising the issue of human encroachment on wild animal habitats			1
" there are many cases where human habitats are encroaching on those of big cats , which are getting lesser and lesser over the years , " said @entity83 , @entity84 for the @entity85			1
" the cats are forced to come out of their habitats to look for food			2
there is lots of habitat loss and with that food source loss -- it 's one of the main problems , which is why they are coming out			0
" officials said at least nine people have died from tiger attacks since the end of december			0
eight of those deaths have been blamed on a single man - eating female tiger			2
" it is possible that the tiger came out ( of her habitat ) looking for food and the humans accidentally came out in front of the tigers , which would mean she would be bound to kill them			0
maybe she was with cubs , and as tigers are very protective they will actively attack threats			0
" @entity83 said that in areas where there is no human encroachment , population numbers are stable			2
however , he agreed that if a particular animal was positively identified as one responsible for human deaths , " then one option is taking her out			2
