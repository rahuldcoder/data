-- when @entity2 swanned onto the @entity4 scene in pink satin and ermine in the early 19th century , she created a new role for first ladies			0
the president 's wife could appear larger - than - life on the public stage , imparting emotional and psychological messages about her husband to the public			1
our most famous first ladies were charismatic figures : @entity2 's message confirmed the @entity22 administration 's legitimacy and authority ; @entity24 helped @entity26 - weary @entity25 feel hopeful and virtuous ; @entity27 showed the world that the @entity29 were a new breed of young , modern , cosmopolitan @entity25			0
our current first lady belongs to this tradition			0
@entity33 , dressed in @entity34 , with her little girls and career firmly in hand , assures us that people like us are in power			0
opinion : @entity41 did great , but wo n't move needle of course , many first ladies have preferred to remain in the background			1
@entity45 famously insisted on remaining a largely domestic creature			2
@entity47 proudly eschewed the spotlight , while her daughter - in - law @entity49 -- perhaps one of the most productive recent first ladies -- did her work quietly and without a lot of fuss			0
still , even the most modest of presidential wives can help a president or candidate seem more human and less a political machine			2
when @entity41 mounted the platform at the @entity60 convention , she appeared to be a first lady wannabe of the second camp			1
she , too , is proudly domestic and puts herself outside politics			1
and she seems , well , like a perfectly nice woman -- the kind you 'd like to have as a neighbor			0
when she began her speech , " tonight i want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts " and " tonight i want to talk to you about love , " it looked as if @entity41 was about to tell her personal story in an effort to warm and fuzzy up her rather remote and stiff husband			1
one might say no candidate 's wife has had so great an opportunity to make a difference			1
no matter if they support or decry @entity86 's politics , people generally agree that @entity86 does n't always seem human , much less a beacon of compassion and empathy			2
but the need to make @entity86 more personable is so great that , in planning @entity41 's speech , his advisers may have overreached			1
after her initial talk about love , instead of relating personal anecdotes , she went on to address remarks to hardworking families and especially women " who have to do a little more			0
" it seems her husband 's handlers recognize that in addition to @entity86 's personality , @entity60 policy needs warming up a little too			1
can @entity86 bring love and empathy to people who are struggling , even to people whose lives are so different from his own ? @entity41 had to humanize @entity86 as the husband and father she trusts and whom we can trust			1
in that , she was on steady ground in telling her " when @entity118 " story , positively beaming when she spoke of being a wife and mother			2
women in the hall clapped their hands off for that			0
but she was not in her element in her evocations of sighing mothers at the end of a hard day , in offering insights and empathy for women and families struggling to pay bills , to buy gas and food			0
that 's too much for her to do			0
she has neither the personal nor the professional authority to talk about the difficulties of poor , working - class or even middle - class @entity25			1
opinion : @entity41 stole the show on opening night her remark about women doing more , and doing it happily , is cringe - worthy : does she know that with women making , at the best , about 80 % of what men do , they have to do more just to break even ? i understand @entity86 's advisers are in a tough position			2
@entity153 are painting him as a heartless capitalist , ruthlessly firing and downsizing to make @entity156 one more dollar			0
even loyal @entity60 , who will support @entity86 to the end , are n't excited about the guy			1
but do n't put it all on @entity161 's shoulders			0
she ca n't be @entity2 and @entity45 at the same time			1
no woman should have to work that hard			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 : @entity41 seems to be a political wife who is domestic and outside politics
@entity171 : her speech was best when she tried to humanize her husband
@entity171 : but she tried to identify with the struggles of poor and middle class and should n't have
@entity41 ca n't relate to the poor or make @entity60 policy warm and fuzzy , @entity166 writes
