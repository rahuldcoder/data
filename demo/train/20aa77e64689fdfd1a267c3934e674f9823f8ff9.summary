-- when 81 - year old @entity2 took it upon herself to restore a flaking century - old fresco of @entity6 on her local church 's wall in @entity10 last year , she was treated to an international lambasting like only the @entity12 makes possible			1
her work , which would have looked more at home on a proud parent 's fridge door than on a house of worship , spawned memes , merchandise and even a @entity22 board of alternative " restorations			1
" but things have taken a turn for the better , with the " @entity27 " depiction , as it has become known , drawing tourists to the town of @entity30 in the thousands			2
the church , which started charging people to see the mural , has raised â ‚ ¬ 50,000 ( $ 72,500 ) for a local charity from 70,000 visitors , according to local news site @entity37 ( @entity10 only )			2
local restaurant and bar owners say business is booming and there are plans to produce official lines of merchandise including plates , postcards and cigarette lighters , with the proceeds split between @entity50 and the local council			1
@entity50 , who has sold artwork on @entity53 , even opened her own art exhibition in @entity30 this week , displaying pieces that suggest she is not totally devoid of talent			0
" i am happy ... people are being very nice , " she told @entity57			0
" there are people who supported me a lot and i am very happy because of that			0
" her exhibition runs until august 24 .			0
