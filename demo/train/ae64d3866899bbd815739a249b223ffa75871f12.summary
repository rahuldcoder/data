editor 's note : we asked readers to weigh in on @entity6 producer @entity5 's vacation destination , and you chose @entity8			1
check back for a wrap - up of his trip			2
@entity5 explores @entity8 's @entity12			1
@entity13 , @entity8 ( @entity6 ) -- the very best travel days often happen when good karma and perfect timing collide			1
and , somehow , on this morning , it also took a bit of tequila			2
of course , normally , the latter ingredient tends to be counterintuitive			2
i arrived at the reception desk - slash - bar of my hostel , @entity24 , at 8:40 in the morning to be picked up for a full day of shark - diving			1
however , it was then that i learned that the seas were deemed too rough , and the tour was cancelled			2
next thing i know , a glass of tequila is slammed in front of me with a bit of sage bartender advice , " might as well			0
" normally , one would simply decline and go about attempting to have a relatively human - like existence on planet earth			0
but at this place , there 's really no backing out			1
in fact , unless you like spontaneous hat parties and have a thing for sleeping under tables , it 's best not to hang out in the reception room			1
fortunately , i 'm a rather strong - willed individual , free - thinking and confident			0
so , naturally , i buckled under the pressure			0
what can i say ? i like these people			0
but as i was sitting there with a few other hostel folks who , apparently , also found it completely fit to begin ruining their day before nine , a @entity53 kid came into the room and offhandedly mentioned that he and two @entity53 girls had a car and were driving out to the @entity12			1
" can i come ? " and just like that , i was rescued from the gates of hell			0
i love you , @entity66 ! the @entity12 is the southwestern-most point of the @entity69 continent , and it 's an absolute thing of beauty			1
panoramic views paint the sky as waves crash against the rocky shore			0
here , the @entity77 and @entity78 oceans become one			0
a decorative sign in the gift shop boasts : where @entity81			0
however , the real currents actually come together a little farther east			0
it 's still amazingly beautiful , so , you know ... whatever			2
and after a full day of hiking and exploring the @entity12 with my new friends , we arrived back at the hostel to find our other friends right where we left them			1
their heads turned as i entered , and one of them yelled out , " @entity5 ! shots ! " might as well .			1
