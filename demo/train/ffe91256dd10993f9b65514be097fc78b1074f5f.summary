@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 detains hundreds of people each year without charge or trial to " keep them out of circulation " in the northern state of @entity9 and @entity10 , according to a new report released monday by @entity12			1
the human rights monitoring group documented how @entity1 's @entity14 ( @entity15 ) is used to justify long - term detentions of people , even when there is insufficient evidence for trial			1
the draconian act has come under repeated criticism from human rights groups who have expressed alarm over @entity26 caught in the fight between @entity1 security forces and militant groups in the @entity31 state			1
the @entity12 report estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 people were detained in the past two decades ; 322 of them were held between january and september of last year when a wave of unrest swept the region and people took to the streets in deadly anti-government protests			1
" the @entity9 and @entity10 authorities are using @entity15 detentions as a revolving door to keep people they ca n't or wo n't convict through proper legal channels locked up and out of the way , " said @entity40 , @entity12 's @entity41 director			1
" hundreds of people are being held each year on spurious grounds , with many exposed to higher risk of torture and other forms of ill - treatment			0
" among the detainees are political leaders and activists , suspected members or supporters of armed opposition groups , lawyers , journalists , and protesters , including children , @entity12 said			2
the report said that often , people are initially picked up for " unofficial " interrogation and have no access to a lawyer or their families			2
@entity12 said the @entity1 government has relied on the safety act in dealing with a resurgence of street protests			1
" despite this apparent shift in the nature of the unrest , @entity9 and @entity10 authorities continue to rely on the @entity15 rather than attempting to charge and try those suspected of committing criminal acts , " @entity40 said			0
" the @entity15 undermines the rule of law and reinforces deeply held perceptions that police and security forces are above the law			0
" the state 's chief minister @entity86 denied that so many people had been detained under the act			1
he said 4,046 people were arrested in the protests			0
but , he said , 3,900 of them were released and only 28 had been detained			0
a senior police officer told @entity2 that about 250 people were detained under the @entity15 in the past year but some had been released			0
the @entity1 state is divided into mostly @entity9 and @entity10 , where many residents argue that the territory should have been a part of @entity100 when the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947			2
polls have found a majority of @entity104 in the state favor secession			0
the @entity1 government blames @entity100 for furling an insurgency in @entity10			2
tens of thousands of @entity26 have died in the bloodshed over the years			0
@entity110 , coordinator of the @entity9 and @entity10 coalition of civil societies , said the @entity14 gives the @entity1 government powers to arbitrarily detain detain a person for two years without trial , against @entity1 's principles of justice			1
@entity2 's @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this story .			0
