a worthy successor to its 2008 social hit and puzzle - platforming predecessor			0
@entity6 , the team that developed " @entity11 , " takes another crack at opening the imagination of players with new challenges , weapons and rides			1
the hero , @entity11 ( or @entity11 , depending on the gender you choose ) , returns to tackle a single - player story that has a plot , supporting characters and villains			1
in " @entity11 , " players took their @entity26 avatar through different levels , based on real - world locations			1
in " @entity5 , " the world has been overrun by the forces of evil and destruction , and @entity11 is recruited by the @entity33 , a group that wants to restore goodness , and cupcakes , to everyone			1
the first thing i noticed in the single - player actions was the voices created by real actors			0
during gameplay in " @entity11 , " characters just muttered or grunted while speech bubbles spelled out what they were saying			1
now , the nonplayer characters ' voices lend extra atmosphere to the scenes			1
@entity11 still bounds through an obstacle course of physical challenges			2
he gets some new tools , such as gloves that help him lift and toss large items , and a grappling hook that shoots out to get him over and around larger chasms			0
the object is the same as the first game : collect point bubbles and materials to dress up your @entity11 or the surrounding scenery with stickers			1
the action is whimsical , with a dash of @entity71 humor , and there are some laugh - out - loud references if you pay attention			0
the additional fun comes from making your own levels			1
indeed , @entity77 , one of the co-founders of @entity6 and technical director on " @entity5 , " said that players from the first game wanted more options to be able to share their own creations with others			1
" it was the number one request of the first game , " @entity77 said			2
" it was , ' oh , i spent the weekend making a shrine to my cat			2
how do i advertise it ? how do i reach an audience ? ' " @entity77 said they created a feature in the game that creates a url for each level players make , so they can put it on @entity97 or @entity98 or in an e-mail			0
in this way , gamers ' amazing levels are seen by a wider audience and hopefully inspire others to do the same			0
" what we were amazed at the first time around was that there was actually really good content , " @entity77 said			0
" so we definitely learned a lot , and we 've got a lot more recommendations to guide [ players ] to those levels that are likely to appeal to you			0
" those who want to create will find new tools and tricks to make their imagination come to life much easier			0
@entity77 said these tools have been used in creative ways that developers never imagined			0
" i 've always been so pleasantly surprised by not patronizing gamers , " he said			0
" there is this untapped potential of the community that never ceases to amaze me in a very good way			0
" most of the original creations from " lbp " were what @entity77 called " homages " to other role - playing games or classic platforming games			0
with the addition of new tools like the @entity137 , which lets @entity11 make whatever he needs to solve a puzzle , new community levels are expected to be more expansive and imaginative			1
there are also vehicles in " @entity5 " that have their own abilities and powers			2
@entity11 can ride a bouncing puppy with a sonic bark , or a multi-humped camel that shoots missiles out of his mouth			2
it is also backward - compatible , meaning that anything that was created in the first game will play just as nicely in " @entity5			1
" any @entity11 creation , including all materials and clothing , will automatically be loaded in " @entity5			1
" overall , the new single - player story with real voice acting and nonplayer characters is a welcome change from a simple physics - engine platformer			1
while the story is as old as time , the action and the humor are fun , exciting and an excellent way to learn all the game 's new tools and tricks			1
the community ( at the time of this review , it was filled with levels created by beta players ) has a wide array of selections , from first - person zombie shooters to driving games to traditional platforming games			0
@entity6 also has an area that recommends levels it likes			0
media molecule really hit home with " @entity5			2
" the only way you wo n't enjoy this game is if you ca n't imagine having fun .			2

" @entity5 " boasts authentic human voice acting , lending atmosphere to its scenes
the object is the same : dress your @entity11 and surrounding scenery with stickers
the game 's additional fun comes from making your own levels
