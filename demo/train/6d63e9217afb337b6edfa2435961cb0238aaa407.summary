@entity0 -- @entity2 told an audience last month that she is not thinking about her 2016 presidential plans and told supporters " not to think about it			1
" nonetheless , they 're laying the groundwork necessary to activate a campaign in a not - so - subtle attempt to convince her to run			2
the party that was once known for duplicating efforts and an inability to accept the realities of federal election law believes it has found its groove with a cadre of organizations working in concert to elect the first woman president			0
" everybody is swimming in their own lane , which is very unusual for @entity29 , " said @entity23 , head of @entity24 and a @entity1 contributor			2
" usually @entity29 bump into each other all the time			2
" does @entity31 secretly support @entity2 for 2016 ? the message from @entity29 is that each group has their own goal : @entity24 deals with high - dollar fundraising and making ads ; @entity37 builds grassroots support and a sizable e-mail list ; @entity40 grows excitement in electing a woman president ; and @entity43 handles messaging , research and rapid response to attacks from opponents			1
in @entity51 , @entity50 forces try to tap @entity31 magic group known for backing @entity2 also defends @entity55 each group 's early efforts are unprecedented -- especially considering @entity50 has yet to announce her presidential intentions -- causing some senior @entity29 to worry that focusing on 2016 is taking @entity29 ' focus off the 2014 midterms with the balance of power in the @entity63 at stake			1
@entity50 hits midterm trail with an eye on 2016 but what really sets these coordinated efforts apart are the close personal ties between organizations and a super pac board that 's stacked with a who 's who list of @entity75 operatives			1
the @entity75 board when @entity24 announced its new board last month , most on the list were either picking up a paycheck , closely tied to or advising one of the groups urging @entity50 to run			1
@entity83 , the chairperson of @entity37 , is on the board			2
so is @entity86 , the prolific fundraiser behind the @entity88 and @entity89			0
also earning a seat : @entity91 , president of @entity40 , and @entity93 , a longtime @entity50 confidant and an adviser to ready for @entity2			1
the announcement made it clear that the @entity24 board is shaping up to become the nexus of the groups pushing a @entity50 campaign			1
" if you look at our board , the @entity24 board , that is coordination incarnate			2
that is coordinating , " @entity23 said			0
" this is where a lot of conversation occurs			0
that , i think , shows the connection and the cooperation on my side			0
" and a number of sources close to the process of putting the @entity24 board together said the intent was to center the body around these pro-clinton groups			1
the coordination extends to president @entity31 's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns			0
earlier this year , @entity24 made a big splash when it named @entity124 , @entity31 's campaign manager , as the board 's co-chairman			2
the move had some political experts questioning whether @entity124 's move to @entity24 was a tacit presidential endorsement for @entity50			2
@entity132 press secretary @entity131 said that @entity124 is " an independent @entity133 citizen " who is " not affiliated with the president , the @entity132			2
" @entity124 has started with the super pac , including working with the new board			0
so far , the board has had a handful of conference calls and the expectation is there will be regular interaction between the @entity75 operatives			1
even longtime @entity146 operatives like @entity86 say , " this kind of cooperation on behalf of a unified @entity146 front is unprecedented			1
" the longstanding relationships also at play is the web of friends , confidants and former colleagues that have staffed the groups			2
many of the top strategists at each organization have worked together , some for decades			0
each organization said the trust between these individuals makes it easier to coordinate			0
" if you have been in this town long enough , you have worked on @entity169 , you have worked in politics , chances are you have almost worked with everyone in your age group in that level , " said a source at @entity89			0
" with that , the line between work drinks and drinks with friends is oftentimes one in the same			0
" with this familiarity comes an ease and , sometimes , an expectation that the @entity146 operatives with a common goal will help each other out			1
@entity186 , founder of @entity37 , and other members of the super @entity136 's staff have a weekly call with @entity191 and @entity89			0
when @entity40 has an event for @entity193 president -- the group 's initiative to elect a woman president -- ready for @entity2 will get an early heads - up			1
@entity186 had lunch with @entity201 , the executive director for @entity24 , in early february , shortly after priorities made clear it would be a @entity75 group with a focus on 2016			1
the lunch was set up in an effort to strengthen bonds between the groups and make sure the organizations were n't stepping on each others toes			2
" they trust each other , they have worked with each other for a long time , " said a source at @entity37			0
" it just makes it easier to work together			0
" the problems some senior @entity146 operatives think that focusing on 2016 this early is a distraction from the upcoming 2014 midterm elections			1
earlier this month , @entity223 , the executive director of the @entity224 and a longtime @entity50 supporter , sent off a trio of tweets pushing operatives , fundraisers and donors to not lose focus on 2014			1
" to those who are # @entity234 , we 've got another job to do before 2016 , " said one			0
" to the donors who want to expand the electorate , fight voter suppression laws & win in 2014 , we need your help now , " said another			0
@entity223 's job is to protect their blue majority in the @entity63			0
democrats also hope to win back the @entity132 in 2014 , but the chances of that look dim			1
@entity247 , @entity31 's former campaign manager , tweeted earlier this month , " with the @entity63 seriously at risk , and the @entity249 spending prodigiously , should n't dem funders be focused on ' 14 and not ' 16 races ? " in reaction , @entity201 sent out a memo to @entity24 supporters making it clear that the @entity146 super pac would not be sitting out the 2014 midterms			1
" no one should sit out the 2014 midterm elections , period , " @entity201 wrote			0
" @entity24 , which was founded to preserve , protect and defend the @entity31 presidency , was not born with an eye toward congressional races			0
however , the upcoming midterm elections are so critical for our future and the ability of the next president to govern that we must engage			0
" there are other problems that come with amassing a campaign infrastructure without having a candidate			0
namely : what happens if @entity50 decides not to run ? while many friends and confidants believe @entity50 will run , most tell @entity1 that she has yet to decide			1
there are @entity29 waiting in the wings , but almost all @entity146 focus for 2016 has been trained on @entity50			1
a @entity1 / @entity280 released earlier this month showed 70 % of @entity29 would support @entity50 's nomination in 2016			1
poll : if not @entity50 , then what kind of @entity284 ? @entity1 / @entity285 poll : @entity287 's loss appears to be @entity50 's gain the pro-clinton groups have said they would help other @entity29 should @entity50 not run			1
ready for @entity2 would use the substantial e-mail list it has amassed to help different state parties and candidates			2
earlier this year , @entity43 showed it was a team player by defending vice president @entity55 against @entity296 attacks			0
the groups are staffed by @entity50 loyalists and all hope the former first lady will run			1
if @entity50 does n't run , the resources amassed to help her will be in question			1
the irony back in 2010 , the @entity305 open the floodgates to outside campaign spending in their @entity309 ruling			0
at the time , @entity29 derided the decision as " bad for @entity311 " and @entity31 bashed the ruling in his @entity314 address			2
conservative groups seized the opportunity and spent millions of dollars in support of @entity296 campaigns			0
conservative super pacs outspent liberal groups by a 3 - 2 margin , $ 36.7 million to $ 24.6 million , according to analysis by the @entity323			0
that gap grew to 2 - 1 of the $ 609 million raised by super pacs in 2012			0
although many pro-clinton @entity146 operatives say they wish big money was not a part of politics , the pro-clinton groups have embraced the law			1
advisers close to the groups equate the supervision from the @entity335 to the " @entity336 , " where little is off - limits and groups can have a sizable impact years out from @entity340 2016			1
" you have to play the game with the rules as they are , " said the @entity24 source			0
" we ca n't unilaterally disarm			0
" a source close to @entity37 said they 're using " @entity309 ruling to benefit @entity29			1
we would n't be doing this if we did n't believe it could work			2
" rubio on 2016 : @entity50 would ' struggle ' @entity55 on 2016 : if @entity2 runs , it wo n't affect my decision jeb on @entity358 family name : ' it 's an issue ' @entity287 's poll numbers still tumbling what would @entity29 do without @entity50 in 2016 ? 2016 watch : not your daddy 's @entity296			1

a web of @entity146 groups backing a possible second @entity132 bid by @entity2 is organizing
groups bound by close personal ties and board packed with @entity75 operatives
but the early work for @entity50 could distract @entity29 from the 2014 midterms
and the question *remains* : what if @entity50 does n't run in 2016 ?
