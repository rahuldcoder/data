@entity0 @entity6 and @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , had unlimited options			1
they could have decided to travel the world , fill their garage with sports cars , or even buy their own island -- fantasies most people entertain when dreaming of a big win			0
but the couple chose to stay put in @entity8			0
@entity6 still meets friends daily for coffee at a local convenience store			1
and although he considered buying a @entity25 after his win , @entity6 opted for a pickup			2
in fact , what the @entity28 have elected to do with their windfall is far from island buying -- which brings us back to the sewage treatment plant			1
it 's one of many civic projects the @entity28 have decided to fund for their local community , and specifically @entity6 's hometown of @entity39 , @entity9 -- a small enclave comprising fewer than 500 residents			1
they 'll pay for a new fire station and a new ball field			1
they 'll also donate $ 50,000 towards the sewage treatment plant			1
the fire station will have direct access to highways , and the ball field will be set further away from one -- allowing the kids to play out of the range of traffic			2
as for the sewage treatment plant , that will enable residents to do away with personal septic tanks			1
@entity56 , @entity39 fire chief , says not only will the new location give the fire department better access to the community , but it will help integrate the local ambulance district with the fire station , improving emergency response times			1
the @entity28 also donated a scholarship fund to nearby @entity65 in @entity8 , where both graduated			0
city officials estimated these works would have taken around 25 years to complete if the city had to rely on its existing tax base			0
@entity56 concurs with this figure -- and says the changes they 're now able to make were n't even in their 5 or 10 year plans			0
@entity56 , who went to high school with the @entity28 , says their decision to use their winnings from the largest @entity4 jackpot in history , for the community comes as no surprise , if you know the couple			2
" money changes a lot of people , " @entity56 says			0
" they are just good people and are willing to help others			0
" perhaps the @entity28 were heeding the words of the famously philanthropic @entity91 : " surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community			2
" indeed at the press conference , @entity7 echoed @entity91 's sentiment ; " for some reason ( @entity102 ) put it in our hands , " she said , " i think to make sure it goes to the right things			0

@entity6 and @entity7 won half of a $ 587 million payout
no big life changes yet : @entity6 still meets friends for coffee each *day* at a local convenience store .
instead of large purchases , the @entity28 opted to give back to their local community
@entity39 , @entity9 , looks *forward* to a new *firehouse* , ball field and sewage treatment plant , *courtesy* of the @entity28
