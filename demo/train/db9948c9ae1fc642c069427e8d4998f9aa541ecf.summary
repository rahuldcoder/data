@entity0 , @entity1 -- over the past few days , @entity4 forces have made " significant advances " -- in the northwest and in the regions of @entity8 and @entity9 -- a spokesman for @entity12 's military operation told reporters tuesday			1
" @entity17 forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to @entity0 , " said col. @entity14 , who described the advances as " the most significant @entity4 territorial gain we have seen in months			1
" since the end of july , as the threat from @entity23 forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western @entity27 mountains , he said			2
since friday , the northwest coastal city of @entity8 has been free of @entity23 forces , he said			2
and the threat from nearby @entity30 has diminished as @entity23 forces are being pushed farther west , he added			2
over the last week , @entity12 warplanes have damaged or destroyed some 150 military targets as part of @entity34 , @entity14 said			0
" our assessment , without going into details , is that the @entity39 regime does not have anymore an effective operational capability , " he said			1
@entity14 said that rebels had occupied @entity42 and @entity43 west of @entity0 , but added that the regions were " still contested			1
" however , @entity1 state television reported that @entity23 forces and tribal fighters were " cleansing the city of @entity43 from the gangs of traitors " and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into @entity0			1
though the center of @entity57 was under rebel control , " there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , " @entity14 said			1
still , @entity60 secretary of state @entity59 expressed optimism			1
" i think the sense is that @entity39 's days are numbered , " she told reporters in @entity63			2
but a spokesman for the @entity39 government offered a different view			1
" we are doing very well , " @entity69 told reporters			0
" it 's true that it 's a bit slow -- people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in @entity42 and @entity43 and whatnot because of armed gangs			0
that 's true but , @entity79 willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully			2
we will achieve peace and victory			0
" he added , " we are fighting @entity12 -- not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members			0
our war is with the crusaders			0
" if rebels gain control of @entity57 , that would be a major stride in putting a stranglehold on the @entity39 - controlled seat of power			1
" we will be very careful entering @entity0 , which we hope to do by the end of this month , " said col. @entity95 , military spokesman for the opposition @entity96			1
@entity95 said there is intelligence that some @entity39 forces are moving to @entity0 from other fronts -- @entity102 in the southeast and @entity104 farther east			1
he said those forces have taken off their uniforms to blend in with the population , a " dangerous " sign those troops are preparing for a " bloody war			0
" he said rebels in @entity0 recently were supplied with arms			2
but , he said , " we asked them to stay put until the zero hour			0
" col. @entity114 , a spokesman for the rebels ' western command , said @entity39 forces controlled most of the eastern part of the city and were shelling rebels with @entity122 missiles and artillery			1
" there are still skirmishes with the brigades in the city center , with snipers taking positions , " col. @entity114 said			0
" the fight is now urban warfare there at the moment			1
there have been a lot injured among our ranks but it is hard to give a number			0
" the rebels claim control of towns west of @entity57 to near @entity143			2
these include @entity42 and @entity144			0
" it is a huge deal and a decisive defeat for his forces in that region			0
all these areas are liberated , " @entity95 said			0
col. @entity114 said @entity151 , south of @entity0 's city center , had been taken by rebels but @entity39 loyalists were shelling them from a nearby town			1
there has been " fierce fighting " in @entity159			0
he said rebel forces were surrounding @entity30 in the south , east and northeast and fighting @entity39 forces			1
he said there 's been fighting in the industrial area of @entity9 , where rebels control the residential areas except for one controlled by the @entity39 government			2
@entity39 forces also control the industrial area , @entity95 said			1
" he is trying his hardest to prevent us from access to $ 35 million worth of daily oil money under normal circumstances in @entity9 , " @entity95 said			0
" if we control the port and the refinery in the industrial area , we 'd have that money			0
" @entity2 's @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
