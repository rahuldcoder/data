the big auto show in @entity1 does n't kick off until next week , but major car companies are already showing off some of their more exciting car - tech prototypes here at the @entity4			1
@entity5 and @entity6 unveiled their latest driverless car technology and conducted demonstration drives			1
@entity9 is one of a few states where it 's legal to test drive autonomous cars , though it requires a person to sit in the driver 's seat at all times			1
@entity5 added its highly active assist technology to a modified @entity19			1
the car can slide into a controlled drift to demonstrate how precise the control systems are and how it can handle a critical situation			0
the company has posted a video showing it in action			0
" it 's like the best test driver you have , " said dr. @entity28 , @entity5 project manager driver			1
the car uses steering , breaking and throttle to control acceleration , deceleration and direction in very small , exact amounts			0
the demonstration is just one aspect of the technical building blocks required to make a self - driving car			1
there are also sensors , environmental modeling and decision and driving strategy technologies that @entity5 is working on			1
those were not included on this particular test vehicle			0
early automated - vehicle prototypes from car makers , universities and @entity53 looked like @entity55 experiments , covered in custom - hacked hardware			1
now the technology is getting smaller and the necessary sensors and cameras are shrinking to barely noticeable sizes			1
@entity6 is particularly proud of decreasing the size of its computer systems , which previously filled the entire trunk of the car , into a box that 's mounted inside the glove compartment			1
the @entity69 car manufacturer demonstrated its @entity71 concept car at @entity4			1
@entity6 's real advancement this year is the compact @entity74 car computer			1
in the future , the @entity76 powered system could be used for key automated - driving tasks like traffic sign recognition , lane departure warnings and pedestrian spotting			1
size is n't the only technical challenge			1
dependability is also incredibly important for a computer system driving a car			2
you ca n't reboot a vehicle while it 's hurtling down a highway at 60 mph			0
" we ca n't have these systems crash , " said @entity90 , @entity76 's senior automotive solutions architect			0
" this is a safety critical application			0
" making it legal car makers agree that while there are many technical issues ahead , they may not be the most daunting obstacles self - driving cars face			1
autonomous driving features are at least seven to 10 years away from becoming commercially available			1
the technology inside the cars is developing fast , but the auto industry will need at least that much time to sort out a tangle of non-hardware and software issues to clear the way for the cars			1
" the main problems are regulations and laws , " said @entity6 's @entity110			1
various laws will have to be updated around the world to make it legal for automated cars to drive on the road			1
car manufactures and suppliers are already forming working groups to address the topics and work with governments			0
" we can only influence the technology			2
the framework work must be done by governments , " said @entity28			0
insurance and liability are particular tricky			0
if a car driving itself gets into an accident that results in damages or injuries , who is responsible ? the driver who was watching @entity137 on a state - of - the - art car entertainment system , or the manufacturer that designed the car ? researchers and makers of driverless cars say the technology will be far safer than people - driven vehicles because they eliminate unpredictable human errors like distracted or drunk driving , or poor reactions to emergency situations			1
however , the cars wo n't be accident proof			2
the first major accident involving the technology will be a huge public relations hurdle for the entire industry			2
driverless cars ' people problem inside the vehicle , the humans are the difficulty			2
" the psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge , " @entity28 said			0
at first , cars will share driving responsibilities with their human owners			1
companies are working on automated parking features or traffic assistance technology that will take over in specific scenarios under certain speed limit			2
there will be many times where the driver will have to actually drive , which means they will not be completely off the hook even during downtime			0
" he 's not allowed to sleep , read a newspaper , or a use a laptop , " said @entity110 , outlining some of the rules for a driver in a partially automated vehicle			0
the rules are to minimize the amount of time needed to turn a passive passenger into an alert driver who is in control of the car			0
that 's where the connected , in - car entertainment and information systems come in			2
they may seem like an unnecessary distraction or luxury , but they 're actually a key safety feature in the automated driving system			2
car makers will want to limit drivers to only using in - car systems while not steering so the vehicle can get their attention when there 's an emergency or when they need to take over driving			1
an in - car system can pause movies , turn off e-mail and hide reading materials when it 's time to drive			2
if the driver does n't respond , it might sound alarms and blink lights , eventually turning on the hazards and slowing to a complete stop			0
" we need five to 10 seconds to pull him back into driving , " @entity28 said			1
during that time , the car must be able to operate autonomously			0
will the public want them ? there 's also the small matter of selling the public on automated driving			2
for people who love the act of driving , taking a powerful car like a @entity236 and turning the action over to an automated system might seem like a waste			2
" we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way , " @entity28 said			2
that means bringing content and activities to the car so that the driver can make better use of his or her 30 minutes in traffic			0
they 'll still be able to take over during the fun parts , zipping down a curvy country road			0
@entity252 will be another big concern			0
the various sensors and in - car systems can collect data about driving patterns and locations and save that data in the cloud			1
the idea is to use this information to assist the driver , say updating a car 's route based on real - time mapping information			2
a recent report to @entity268 said in - car services that currently collect location data on drivers do n't always follow recommenced privacy practices			0
many companies , like car makers or gps services , share collected data with third - parties , though the report did n't find any selling the information to data brokers			0
the report recommended the government do more to protect drivers ' privacy			0
information collection will become more prevalent in the future			0
eventually , car makers hope to open up the lines of communications between individual cars on the road to better avoid traffic jams and prevent accidents			0
that technology is even farther off than automated driving , since car manufacturers need to come together to agree on protocols and frequencies			1
as cars pile on more advanced automated technology , it becomes clear they fit into the @entity4 as much as the typical car show			1
they are moving beyond just being cars			0
" the car is becoming a driving robot , a moving robot , " @entity28 said .			0

@entity5 and @entity6 demonstrated autonomous driving vehicles at @entity4 in @entity307
self - driving cars face a number of technical , legal and human challenges
the technology could appear on the roads in seven to 10 years
