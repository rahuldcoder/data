-- @entity1 and @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity4 , are the parents of 18 children , and their family is the focus of a @entity10 reality series			1
@entity1 and @entity2 say they are grateful for their 18 children , and may have more			1
@entity14 , guest host thursday night on " @entity15 , " asked the @entity16 how they are able to stay debt free with such a large family and what they thought of @entity21 , the single mother who recently gave birth to octuplets after having fertility treatments			1
following is a transcript of their conversation			2
@entity14 : let me ask you something			2
what is your reaction to this octomom ? @entity21 , the story			0
what do you think about that ? @entity16 : well , i just know from my own heart , i ca n't judge and look at her and judge her situation			1
i just know from my heart , and personally @entity41 changed our heart about children years ago			2
and so we 've kind of gone about it the old - fashioned way			2
and so we are enjoying each one of the blessings that @entity41 has given us , and we 're thankful for each one of them			0
@entity49 : right , at least you guys enjoyed having the babies , you went through the sex then the giving birth			0
this woman did n't have any of that , except the giving birth , which must have been rough , do n't you think ? @entity16 : oh , my , i ca n't imagine			1
i had twins , but i have -- i just ca n't imagine having eight at once and the responsibility that that brings			1
@entity49 : why do you suppose this woman has provoked such negativity ? they have a " @entity68 " @entity65 poll saying 70 percent of those surveyed are unsympathetic to this woman			0
what is going on ? @entity16 : well , you know , i feel like probably more than anything it 's just the fact of the responsibility issues from their perspective , and i , you know , i imagine that 's probably more of the animosity that 's out there			1
and so -- but i do -- i just ca n't imagine , you know , her -- how she 's going to handle that many little ones under the age of 8			1
that 's a lot of little ones all at once			0
@entity2 : we just need to pray for her			1
@entity49 : but you guys have n't experienced that kind of hostility for the children you have			1
is that because you 're married ? @entity16 : i do n't know			1
i think maybe , you know , being that @entity41 's given ours one or two at a time and we 've kind of done it the old - fashioned way , i do n't know			1
we love them , we 're enjoying them , and by @entity41 's grace we 're taking care of them if he gives us one more			0
so i just think we 're grateful			0
@entity49 : i understand that you guys are debt free			1
i ca n't even imagine how you pulled that off			1
... how did you do that ? @entity2 : well , back about 18 years ago , we saw @entity112 ' financial seminar on dvd , and it was life - changing			1
at that point , we purposed to try to get out of debt and try to stay out of debt			1
and our family motto is to buy used and save the difference			2
we shop a lot at garage sales , thrift stores			0
we bought our industrial kitchen equipment that way , our vehicles that way , and so we really cut corners and we live very frugally			0
@entity2 : that 's right , we 've never bought a new vehicle			1
so we do live -- we try to -- we know how to stretch a dollar			0
@entity49 : how many cars do you have ? @entity2 : we actually have probably about , what ? seven or eight right now ? @entity16 : we have a lot of drivers , which is great			1
@entity49 : seven or eight cars , well , that 's an expensive proposition , is n't it ? do you get public assistance of any kind ? @entity2 : no , we do n't -- we 've never had any public assistance			1
just like our 21 - passenger bus , we bought at a sealed - bid auction for $ 2,100 , we bought an ' @entity147 at an auction for like $ 7,000			2
instead of $ 40,000 on a vehicle we ... @entity49 : yeah , i got it			0
i see what you 're doing			0
but you have a book deal and a tv show			2
that 's got to help			0
do you think the octomom could get a tv show like you have ? that might help her a lot			2
@entity16 : i could not imagine having that many little ones and being busy with a show			1
i think for our situation , our children are a lot older and our heart is really to just share with other families , encourage them that children are a gift and enjoy them while you have them because they grow up really fast			1
and so ... @entity49 : well , you keep having more			0
but you have plenty to still enjoy			0
i do n't see that you 're ever going to have an empty nest syndrome			2
they 're going to be there			0
@entity16 : i hope not			2
@entity49 : you guys will never be alone			0
@entity16 : we look forward to grandbabies , then			2
@entity49 : you know , let me ask you one more question about her			0
if she did get involved in doing a reality show like you guys are doing , do you have any advice for her ? what kind of show should she have ? maybe she needs a baseball team or something			1
what advice could you give her ? @entity16 : i do n't -- i really -- i do n't know			1
@entity2 : yeah , i think it 's a full - time job just taking care of the children while they 're young			1
maybe 10 years from now when the kids are 10 years old , that might be an option			0
but when they 're all small , i think there 's a lot of needs			0
and so , i think , she 'll have her hands full			0
as i know when we had seven that were 7 and under , it was a very busy time			0
@entity49 : are you going to have some more , @entity1 ? @entity2 : i 've always left it up to @entity1			1
@entity16 : we 'll see			2
we 'll take it one at a time			0
i would love more , but we 'll see if the @entity220 sees fit and blesses us with another one			0
@entity49 : do you ever say to @entity2 , get away from me , i have a headache ? @entity2 : actually , i ca n't keep her away from me			1
@entity49 : oh , boy			0
ok , thanks so much for sharing your time with us yet again			0
good luck to you both			0
@entity2 : thank you , @entity14 .			2
