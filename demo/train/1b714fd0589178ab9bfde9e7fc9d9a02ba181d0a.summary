with @entity6 trailing to @entity3 , @entity21 poured forward in search of the goals that would have lifted them into second spot and meant qualification for the last 16			1
but it was @entity27 who had a glorious chance to take the lead just after half - time when @entity122 's cross found @entity123 unmarked six yards from goal but the striker somehow managed to put his header wide			2
then only a brilliant reaction save from @entity21 ' keeper @entity128 prevented @entity122 from scoring as @entity27 broke quickly			2
@entity21 's @entity129 was next to go close as he met @entity131 's free - kick at the far post but he could n't direct his effort on target			2
