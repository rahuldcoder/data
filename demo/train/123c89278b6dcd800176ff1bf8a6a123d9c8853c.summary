leave it to @entity1 to create a public water tap -- inside a lovely park , no less -- with the bubbly stuff			0
for the past couple years , the @entity72 in the city 's southeast 12th arrondissement has been serving up cooled sparkling water to quench @entity1 thirsts ( available any time the park is open )			1
the park 's @entity78 public fountain was the first in @entity81 to add carbon dioxide to the city 's tap water , and locals lapped it up by bringing their own bottles to fill			1

from established talent to emerging artists , you 'll find them at @entity118 / @entity117 , which hosts three to four temporary exhibits each year			0

and with natural roof lighting , reduced water use and renewable - source electricity , they 're eco-friendly to boot			0
life 's a beach ( during the summer , at least )			2
so what if the @entity169 that snakes through @entity1 has no beach ? this city is nothing if not inventive -- so mayor @entity174 spearheaded the creation of @entity176 , man - made " beaches " that offer locals and tourists alike a " @entity180 " each summer			1
starting around july 20 and for four weeks after , the city closes the streets along the river , brings in tons of sand and palm trees and offers a slew of entertaining options from beach volleyball to kayaking to open - air concerts on three different " beaches			1

just like museums in most world - class cities , many of those within @entity1 open themselves to visitors free of charge one day a week			1
in the @entity1 , that 's the first sunday of each month			2

there 's nothing like traipsing through a city with a local resident by your side			1
the @entity236 , @entity1 greeter program , pairs city visitors with regular residents -- students , working people , retirees and others			1
