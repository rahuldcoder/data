-- it 's all about money			0
that great big money pit where hypocrisy lives and science goes to die			2
yeah , i hear some of you			0
you do n't " believe in it , " as though global warming is some kind of religion			0
well , it sort of is			0
but it has little to do with @entity15 and everything to do with the color green			0
i discovered just how cynical i am about that " money pit " when i sat down recently with @entity19 , a 22 - year - old climate activist and senior at @entity20 whose idealism shines as bright as the @entity22			1
i asked her why the issue is so important			0
" climate change is affecting everything i love and everything i care about , " @entity19 told me			1
" my values at the moment lie around mitigating climate change and doing something about this impending crisis that is going to affect my generation and billions of people around the world			1
" that 's quite a challenge , i said to her			0
let 's face it , there are powerful people out there who think scientists are elitist , politicized job killers			2
" if we come at this from a place of love , " @entity19 responded , " this infinite wellspring of energy that we can draw on , then it 's hard to believe that we ca n't achieve a better world			1
" but i just do n't see a genuine love for the planet these days			0
money and politics are powerful motivators			0
it 's why some really smart people discount the fact there is a 97 % consensus among scientific experts that the @entity64 is getting warmer and human beings are in part to blame			1
the incoming @entity68 majority leader , @entity70 @entity69 @entity67 , told the @entity72 's editorial board that he does n't know if climate change is a real problem because he 's " not a scientist			1
" @entity76 added , " i am interested in protecting @entity70 's economy , i 'm interested in having low - cost electricity			0
" then , he asserted that , " ... in the 1970s , people feared an @entity81 was imminent			0
" actually , only a handful of scientists feared another @entity81			2
the @entity84 points to @entity86 's climatologist @entity85 , a climate - change skeptic , to prove the point			1
@entity85 wrote this for the ( conservative ) @entity91 in 1992 : " indeed , the global cooling trend of the 1950s and 1960s led to a minor global cooling hysteria in the 1970s			0
... but the scientific community never took the issue to heart , governments ignored it , and with rising global temperatures in the late 1970s the issue more or less died			0
" let 's return to 2014			0
a discounted @entity81 analogy comes in handy when , like @entity76 , you come from a state that depends on fossil fuel for jobs , and you 're lobbied relentlessly by an industry with money to burn			1
according to @entity116 : " companies with interests in oil and gas contributed more than $ 70 million to federal candidates in the 2012 cycle , more than double the total contributed in 2010			2
" it goes on to cite , " political donations from the industry -- which includes gas producers and refiners , natural gas pipeline companies , gasoline stations , and fuel oil dealers -- have taken on an increasingly conservative tint over the past two decades			1
in the 2012 cycle , 90 % of its contributions went to the @entity69			2
" @entity67 , by the way , received more than 1.2 million in campaign dollars from oil , coal and gas entities			1
now , i ca n't know for sure whether @entity76 's " disbelief " in climate change is swayed by that great big money pit because , let 's face it , @entity70 depends on the coal industry for thousands of jobs and @entity76 would not be in office if he did n't support the industry			1
@entity19 recognizes that economic fact , but she 's also absolutely sure " that a lot of climate denial comes from the fossil fuel industry buying off politicians , propagating climate denial			1
" so , how exactly would @entity19 's " infinite wellspring of energy " beat out $ 70 million and save the planet ? her solution is to fight fire with fire			1
@entity19 figured that if people like her can persuade @entity20 to divest its $ 36 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies , it would send a powerful message to not only the fossil fuel industry but also our politicians			1
she has co-founded @entity20 to do just that			2
@entity163 has already decided it will no longer directly invest in coal mining companies because it has a responsibility to consider " corporate policies or practices ( that ) create substantial social injury			2
" @entity20 is fighting climate change , too			1
the university has an enviably small carbon footprint and its scientists are among the most respected for their work in global warming			0
but so far , the university has refused to divest because its president , @entity177 , says divestment is " likely to have a negligible financial impact on the affected companies			2
" @entity0 reached out to @entity177 and received no response			0
just as @entity76 's state depends on the coal industry for jobs , @entity20 depends on the industry , too			1
@entity20 has the world 's largest university endowment with $ 32.7 billion			1
as @entity177 points out , @entity20 " counts on the fund to finance more than a third of its operating budget			2
" we think that @entity20 is not a corporation and that profit should n't be our main motivator , " she told me			2
" our main motivator should be about the students			0
and how can we invest in fossil fuel companies that are threatening our futures ? it 's an immoral bet against my generation			1
" keep in mind , the @entity202 , made up of hundreds of scientists , determined climate change has already affected " agriculture , human health , ecosystems ... ( and ) water supplies			1
" @entity211 president @entity210 said global warming could lead to war			0
even the @entity214 says climate change poses an " immediate risk to national security			1
" and still , powerful politicians say , " i 'm not a scientist			0
" and @entity20 still feels pulling its investments out of fossil fuels would " diminish the influence or voice we might have with this industry			1
" i understand where both sides are coming from , but it still bugs me			0
" when you 're talking about climate activism , i agree that we are seen as radical , but the science is so straightforward			2
and what 's radical is ignoring the science			0
what 's radical is continuing to use fossil fuels			0
what 's radical is a government that refuses to address climate change			1
" need i say more ?			0

@entity243 : 97 % of scientists agree on climate change , yet there are deniers
@entity243 : take @entity67 , whose home state has a big coal industry
she spoke with @entity19 , who *advocates* that @entity20 do more on climate change
@entity243 : @entity20 should divest its large endowment from fossil fuel companies
