@entity0 -- while the @entity3 passed legislation barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity with a significant bipartisan vote on thursday , the bill faces major hurdles to even start moving through the @entity11 - led @entity10 , and there 's almost no chance it will come up for a vote this year			1
house speaker @entity15 opposes the @entity16 , known as @entity16 , and believes protections for employees already exist under other laws			1
@entity3 passes @entity22 anti-discrimination bill " the speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost @entity28 jobs , especially small business jobs , " @entity15 spokesman @entity23 said this week			1
and @entity30 , spokesman for @entity10 majority leader @entity31 , told @entity1 " the bill is currently not scheduled " for consideration			2
instead , @entity30 insisted the @entity3 should be doing other work			2
" i hope ( senate majority leader @entity35 ) soon addresses the dozens of @entity10 - passed bills that have been ignored in the @entity3 that create jobs , improve education and create opportunity while @entity28 struggle to find a good - paying job			1
" but rep. @entity42 of @entity43 , one of the five @entity11 co-sponsors of the @entity10 version @entity16 , pointed to his party 's loss in the @entity50 governor 's race on tuesday as a reason why the @entity10 needs to consider the measure			1
" certainly what we see in @entity50 is a difficulty with women and minorities and that 's something the party needs to reconcile and look broadly and think about , " @entity53 told @entity1 on thursday			0
@entity53 's message to the @entity11 was " we need to understand that standing on our own principles is part of this , but the world is a pluralistic place and we represent a broad cross section of @entity28 of different races , generations , sexual orientations , and everyone has rights			0
" @entity73 : it 's ' way past time ' for gay rights law the @entity76 found after last year 's loss in the presidential election that younger @entity28 , who voted disproportionately for @entity79 , weigh their support for a political party based on its tolerance and inclusiveness , including on the issue of gay rights			0
10 @entity87 senators vote with @entity88 advocates of @entity16 also point to national polls that show a majority of @entity87 now support legislation protects gays and lesbians from job discrimination			1
on thursday 10 @entity11 senators joined with @entity97 to pass the measure			0
several senior @entity10 @entity87 congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the @entity10 last considered @entity16 in 2007 , but they also believe most @entity10 @entity11 members would oppose it now			1
they say members are n't hearing much about it from their constituents , so there 's little pressure to vote on it this year			1
@entity109 rep. @entity108 , a five - term @entity87 whose district has been targeted regularly by @entity97 , is another @entity87 who is pushing for a @entity10 vote			1
@entity108 told @entity1 the party 's loss to @entity79 is a key reason why it should get behind the bill			0
" i do believe that we have to learn some lessons from the 2012 election , and to me this is one of them			0
this legislation , @entity16 , is one way to reach out to the @entity22 community in a way that is fair and reasonable and speaks to our shared values			2
i think we all agree we should not tolerate this type of discrimination in any form , " @entity108 said			0
sexual orientation and @entity16 : how we got here @entity108 also said passing the measure " would be an upside to the party , particularly with young voters			2
" outside advocacy groups spent the past year targeting states with @entity139 to secure votes to pass the bill in the @entity3			2
little pressure on @entity11 but @entity10 districts were redrawn in 2010 to make them more solidly red or blue so there are fewer " swing " districts like those @entity108 and @entity53 represent , reducing leverage for supporters			2
" as far as specific @entity10 races are concerned , i ca n't see it being a main issue , " one of the @entity10 @entity11 sources said in predicting that the issue " will kind of fade by friday " without any real push by members for a vote			1
even gay rights advocates who sought to pressure @entity11 senators are n't sugar coating prospects in the @entity10			1
" it 's an uphill climb			0
it 's @entity164 , " @entity162 , vice president of communications at the @entity163 , told @entity1			0
the @entity165 , which has jurisdiction over the issue , has yet to announce a hearing on the bill , and does n't plan any action on @entity16 at this point , according to a spokeswoman for the panel			1
one place where a @entity10 @entity87 could face blowback for lack of action is in @entity178			2
second - term @entity11 rep. @entity179 is running against an openly gay @entity88 candidate , @entity180 , who has worked as an advocate for same - sex marriage			0
@entity179 recently signed on as a co-sponsor of the @entity16 bill			0
@entity185 still a focus but @entity11 aides believe that highlighting problems with the online rollout of @entity185 and focusing on economic issues should remain their top priorities , and say there is little pressure from @entity11 rank and file to move @entity16 , because they largely oppose the bill			1
supporters believe the 2007 @entity10 vote , when 35 @entity199 backed the legislation , could be a marker of how many @entity11 members could vote for the bill now			1
but of that group only a dozen still serve in the @entity10			0
among those who supported that measure was 2012 @entity11 vice presidential nominee @entity208 , @entity209			0
but that version of @entity16 was drafted more narrowly and @entity208 's spokesman says the congressman is opposed to the @entity3 bill at this point			1
" congressman @entity208 does not believe someone should be fired because of their sexual orientation			0
that said , any legislation to address this concern should be narrowly crafted to guard against unintended consequences , " @entity218 told @entity1			0
@entity224 @entity223 said @entity15 's move to avoid a vote is part of a pattern , criticizing his decision to spend money backing a court challenge to uphold a ban on same - sex marriage , which the @entity234 overruled			2
fighting a losing battle in the @entity10 democrats might try to force a vote through a procedural maneuver but know it probably wo n't happen			1
@entity162 told @entity1 the effort to pass the bill will take some time , but the @entity163 is working to get at least 25 of the 35 @entity199 they believe would vote for the bill to publicly endorse it			0
he said @entity16 should fit into the @entity10 @entity87 's economic agenda since it promotes employees keeping their jobs			1
supporters are also looking for other ways to get it to the @entity10 floor			0
one option is attaching the measure to next year 's defense authorization bill in the @entity3 and sending that to the @entity10			1
by tucking the measure into a must - pass bill that @entity10 @entity87 support , any effort to oppose @entity16 would mean adopting an amendment to strip it out			1
advocates believe they could muster the votes to block that			0
this strategy was used to move another contentious issue involving gay rights -- the repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy barring service in the military			0
@entity108 believes outside advocates need to do some legwork to educate @entity199 , many of whom did n't serve in @entity272 the last time the issue came up for a vote			2
but he notes this session of @entity272 does n't wrap up until the end of 2014 so " they 'll be time over the next 14 to 15 months to make progress in the @entity10			2
" @entity162 said he is prepared for the challenge and predicts the same constituents who moved the @entity3 to act will do the same in the @entity10			1
" there are gay people in every single member of @entity272 ' district who we will mobilize , " he said .			0

@entity3 passes @entity16 with help of 10 *republicans*
house speaker @entity15 has said he opposes other laws that already cover the issue
@entity10 congressional aides say they are n't hearing from constituents on the issue
democrats might try to force a vote in the @entity10 but know it probably wo n't happen
