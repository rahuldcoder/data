text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident , calling the girl " sloppy , " making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on , @entity171 has said			2
@entity0 has not been able to establish whether this is true			0
in one 12 - minute video , a teenager who is not charged in the case jokes about the girl 's condition , saying she must have died because she did n't move during one assault			1
