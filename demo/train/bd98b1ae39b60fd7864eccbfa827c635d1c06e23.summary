and that 's what makes his death at a race in @entity20 last weekend , at the age of only 24 , so hard to bear			1
" someone says that @entity25 calls the best ones first ; maybe that 's why he had to go , " said his father @entity22 , before breaking into tears			2
it was one of the few times his father has cried			2
he gave a long television interview showing @entity9 's room -- that of a teenager not of a world championship rider , with posters of his hero @entity37 still on the wall			1
after the crash at the @entity41 in @entity42 where his son died , @entity39 spoke a lot			1
unexpectedly , he thanked everyone -- those who helped @entity9 , the journalists , the thousands of fans queuing in the rain for a last farewell			1
his father is dying inside , and we should be comforting him , but instead we wait for his words to try to comfort ourselves			2
he has every reason to be upset , but instead he talks to us serenely , thanking life for giving him such a shining son			2
@entity22 tells us how positive @entity9 was to everyone , " and that he was beautiful even when i saw him dead			1
" this is another gift we get from @entity9 -- joyful , smiling , happy when alive -- and now his family are still inspiring us to love life even when anger would be justified			1
@entity62 has been @entity9 's girlfriend since 2006			1
it 's known that motorsport offers lots of " fun ' " for drivers			0
@entity9 once said : " lots of girls come close , it would be so easy ... but i feel good with @entity62 , why would i mess everything up ? " they were building their house			1
not the one of a millionaire			0
it is right beside @entity9 's parents ' house , with a huge table to have dinner with all their friends			1

he was very open to the world , even if it sometimes landed him in trouble			0
back in may , after being heavily accused by @entity102 press and riders of causing @entity104 to crash and break his collarbone , several death threats were addressed to @entity9 from @entity102 ahead of the @entity106			1
at first , his @entity108 team and his family hid those threats from him , knowing they would shock his sensitivity			1
a few days before traveling to @entity113 , they revealed what was going on at a dinner			0
@entity9 was scared , but most of all staggered			1
his girlfriend said that , while listening to his father , @entity9 reduced the wine cork he was holding into tiny pieces			1
he kept on repeating : " why do they threaten me ? what i have done wrong ? " while a public figure might usually dismiss those threats as from some maniac , @entity9 instead questioned himself			1
he could n't understand why this could happen			0
but he was not only a genuine guy , he was also a formidable rider			2
@entity37 is the legend , while @entity128 and @entity129 are the leading lights now			0
but maybe nobody , not even @entity37 , has the sense for overtaking and for going over the limit like @entity9			1
that 's why he was so criticized during his battle with the @entity102 riders			0
but the same things were said 30 years ago to @entity138 and 25 years ago to another @entity140 star , @entity139			0
" he is dangerous , he is crazy , someone will soon be hurt , " they said of @entity9			1
but @entity9 was a real racer -- and that means overtaking			1
@entity146 , his manager and a significant figure in the world of @entity41 racing , described him as : " a driver not of this time , from an era where racing meant trying every second to go past your rival			0
" obviously , a rider like this made his rivals nervous			2
seven - time world champion @entity37 , who loved @entity9 as a brother , explains it best : " having a duel one - vs - one with @entity9 , it 's like if you 're going to have a punch against a huge guy : you already know you will always be the one beaten up			1
" @entity12 had a gem , a pure talent with a pure soul			1
that 's why the tears ca n't stop			0
his mother @entity170 was at home at @entity173 , @entity174 , when @entity9 died			1
a couple of hours after his death , some of his friends gathered outside the house , crying together			0
she walked out , the greatest pain inside her but dignity on her face , and told them : " no guys , stop crying			0
@entity9 would be so sad to see you fall apart			1
you always laughed with him , just remember the good times you had together			0
" @entity9 is unique for us because -- despite how @entity12 feel aggrieved by his fate -- when we see him again on tv , when his interviews are replayed , we ca n't help but laugh			1
he was the hilarious cousin always in a good mood , the one you were looking forward to spend time			0
funny , mamma mia , so funny			0
he was our " @entity195			0
" would you ever imagine a celebrity saying this : " when i wake up early , for example when i have jet - lag , i run to jump in the bed of my parents while they sleep			0
i 'm crazy for that			0
" his nickname was actually " @entity205			0
" and now his last farewell has been given , bikes escorted his coffin to the church , and 60,000 people attended his funeral on thursday			2
