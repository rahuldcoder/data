-- he 's still a teenager , but @entity2 has already seen plenty in his life			1
his story begins in @entity5 , a city in southeastern @entity6			1
at 16 , alone , living in poverty , threatened by violent gangs in his neighborhood and practically abandoned by his parents , @entity2 decided to leave everything behind and migrate to the @entity12			1
" if you did n't join the gangs , they would kill you , " @entity2 says , " and i did n't want to join because i knew if i did it , i could die very soon			1
" by the time he left , he had managed to save $ 100			0
@entity2 traveled by bus through @entity17 and crossed the @entity18 illegally into @entity19			1
he then boarded a bus for the @entity12 border			0
at one point , he says he was detained by @entity19 soldiers and questioned			0
his @entity6 accent betrayed him , but somehow he was let go			1
it took the teenager two weeks to get to the @entity27 border , eating at bus stations and sleeping wherever he could			2
crossroads of hope and fear : stories from a desert bus station with the help of older immigrants , @entity2 says he swam across the @entity36 , reaching @entity27 and @entity12 soil for the first time			1
his only belongings were the clothes he was wearing and a few dollars in his pocket			0
he was detained by immigration authorities near @entity43 and sent to a detention center where he would spend three months before being released to the custody of a relative living in @entity47			1
@entity2 is now a permanent resident in the @entity12 , thanks to a little - known immigration law that helps undocumented minors arriving alone in this country			1
the law , officially known as special immigrant @entity53 , was first enacted by @entity55 in 1990			1
in 2008 , that law was expanded and reauthorized under new legislation			2
according to the @entity62 , " the purpose of the @entity59 program is to help foreign children in the @entity12 who have been abused , abandoned , or neglected			2
" minors who are approved can live and work permanently in the @entity12			0
@entity65 to spend millions to curb undocumented children @entity67 is an immigration attorney and the executive director of @entity69 , an organization that provides low - cost legal services			1
@entity67 says that applying for this immigration benefit is difficult because you have to prove your case at the state and federal level			1
" not every kid that applies gets to stay			0
not every kid who enters can even apply			0
you have to be abandoned , abused and neglected			0
you have to be without your parents			0
there are minimum requirements , but then there 's also the rigorous process of immigration , so not every kid gets to stay , " @entity67 said			2
tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have arrived to the @entity12 this year , mainly from @entity88			0
but @entity67 says very few can actually qualify for this immigration benefit , unlike @entity2 , who was able to prove he was the victim of abuse , abandonment or neglect			1
" if that 's the only message you get out through this , please make sure that 's clear			2
if you send your kids here or kids come on their own , you 're fleeing something in your country , every case is different and every case is difficult , " @entity67 said			2
@entity105 's journey : how thousands of children are creating a crisis in @entity88 she estimates that only about 10 % of the estimated 60,000 children who have migrated to the @entity12 in the last year alone are eligible for this immigration benefit , and of those , only a fraction can actually prove their case in court			1
the rest will be deported , she says			0
' i did n't know i was undocumented ' those minors who qualify under this provision of the law and get approval can obtain a green card , which allows them to stay in this country and have legal status in the @entity12			0
they can then apply for citizenship after five years of living here if they have not committed any crimes , have learned @entity127 and can demonstrate a basic level of knowledge of @entity12 history and government			0
@entity2 turned 18 earlier this year			2
he 's learning @entity127 in high school and getting good grades			0
" my dream is to graduate from high school and then go to college because i want to be a doctor , " @entity2 said , quite an improvement for a young man whose goal as a child was merely to stay alive			2
@entity142 : undocumented and hiding in plain sight opinion : undocumented fed up with partisan politics opinion : how we can help kids crossing at the border			0
