-- @entity1 and @entity2 have rolled out an intriguing @entity3 today -- the 11 - inch @entity3 11			1
@entity4 , as you may recall , run @entity2 's web - centric @entity6 consisting mainly of a web browser and promising simplicity and security			1
if you spend all your time in a web browser and do n't want to spend much on a typical computer , a @entity3 would be worth a closer look			1
i 've used several of them , i own one for quick tasks , my mom has one , @entity14 has one , @entity20 's mom has one			0
they make for good secondary machines or as main machines for basic web browsing			0
there 's been a tradeoff between price -- chromebooks start at around $ 200 -- and specs , but @entity1 's latest offering sets it apart from earlier @entity4 in a few ways			2
for starters , while many other cheap @entity4 feature so - so screens , @entity1 's model sports a nice - ish @entity36 ( in - plane switching ) screen for better viewing angles and more vivid color reproduction			2
second , the @entity3 can be charged with a micro-usb cable -- the same kind used for most non-apple smartphones			1
if you 've a got an @entity47 phone , for instance , you could get away with packing a single charger before you leave the house			0
and finally , there will be a model available later this year with a built - in 4g/lte cellular connection			1
with the exception of the $ 1,300 - and - up @entity54 , previous @entity4 have only had a cellular option that used aging 3g networks			2
design-wise , the @entity3 11 sports similar internal specs to an earlier $ 250 @entity60 model ; both feature a mobile processor more commonly found in smartphones and tablets than portable computers			1
the idea is to offer better battery life , but there 's an associated performance tradeoff			0
the machine has a 16 - gigabyte solid state drive , two gigabytes of memory and @entity1 claims battery life will last up to six hours			0
@entity1 's @entity3 is available now in a @entity75 - only version for $ 279			1
the @entity77 model will be available later this year			2
that 's the one i 'm most interested in for use a mobile reporting computer			0
hopefully the price is right and the cellular data plan options are n't too outrageous			0
