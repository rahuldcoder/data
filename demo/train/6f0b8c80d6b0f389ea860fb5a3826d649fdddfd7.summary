imagine boarding your next flight and having the entire cabin to yourself			0
in this age of overstuffed planes , where we squeeze our bodies into cramped seats and jockey for overhead bin space , it sounds like a dream -- one that would never happen			0
but it did -- sort of -- on monday for a man who boarded a long - delayed @entity19 flight from @entity20 to @entity21 to find that all his fellow passengers had been rebooked on other flights			1
the man , @entity24 of @entity21 , did what most of us would probably do			1
he chose an aisle seat near the front of the plane and stretched out			0
he chuckled at the absurdity of his situation			0
and he got a flight attendant to snap pictures of him , with rows of empty seats in the background			0
" they rebooked everyone but me on another flight to @entity40 , so i am literally the only person on this plane , " he posted			1
" no , i 'm not joking , " he tweeted a few minutes later			1
" i 'm the only one on this plane			2
" the rare situation was caused by bad weather , which caused several flight delays in the @entity45			2
@entity24 's @entity46 , which normally seats 76 people , was delayed for six hours , and somehow he missed out on being rebooked			1
often , an airline will cancel a near - empty flight			2
but @entity19 told @entity50 , a @entity0 affliliate , that it needed to get @entity24 's plane to @entity21 's @entity40 for flights later in the day			1
the most annoying types of airline passengers as it turned out , @entity24 was not the only passenger on the flight			1
the plane was about to push back when , at the last minute , another man hopped on			2
the two did n't keep each other company , however			0
@entity24 told @entity63 the other guy reclined his seat and slept most of the way			2
even so @entity24 , a media strategist and editor of a beer - lovers ' website , wo n't forget his semi-private jet ride anytime soon			1
" it was definitely the most memorable flight i 've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome , " he told @entity63			0
" there were no screaming babies , no one listening to loud lyrics or reclining their seats or taking off their shoes			0
" how bad was 2014 for air travel ?			0

@entity24 was only passenger on a @entity20 - @entity21 flight until the last minute
" no , i 'm not joking , " he tweeted . " i 'm the only one on this plane "
the plane was delayed by weather , and most passengers had rebooked other flights
