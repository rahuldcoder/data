@entity0 -- a short - term spending measure to fund the federal government into next week won approval thursday from the @entity5 and now goes to president @entity7 's desk			1
the measure was part of a bipartisan agreement intended to end a dispute over disaster relief spending that threatened to cause a partial shutdown of the government when the current fiscal year ends at midnight friday			1
congressional approval of the measure keeps the government funded through october 4			2
the @entity5 will then have to consider a more comprehensive measure that would keep the government funded through november 18			1
with most @entity5 members away from @entity0 on a one - week recess , thursday 's approval took place at a " pro forma " session involving just three @entity5 members using a procedure known as " unanimous consent			1
@entity30 of @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity33 conducted the @entity5 business , including the request for the chamber 's unanimous consent of the spending plan , while @entity40 rep. @entity39 of @entity31 kept an eye on the proceedings			2
the @entity43 approved both measures monday			0
together , they would fund the federal government for the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year			0
the spending proposals contain an additional $ 2.65 billion in disaster relief needed by the @entity50 to replenish coffers depleted partly by the federal response to @entity53 , @entity54 , and a series of tornadoes and wildfires this year			1
the new emergency disaster funding will kick in saturday			2
democrats and @entity29 had been at odds over a @entity29 demand to cut spending elsewhere to offset increased disaster relief funding in the current fiscal year			1
@entity50 ended that standoff monday when it indicated that it has enough money to get through the final few days of the current fiscal year			2
if @entity68 had failed to reach a new spending agreement , a partial government shutdown would have occurred with the onset of the new fiscal year on saturday			1
government shutdowns were also threatened during budget talks in the spring and the debt ceiling debate over the summer			0
the short - term funding measures were necessary because @entity68 has failed to complete its full budget appropriations process in recent years due to a sharp partisan divide over government spending issues			0
the november 18 extension expected to win final approval next week was intended to provide time to debate and pass appropriations bills for the remainder of fiscal year 2012			0
however , it 's been more than 15 years since both chambers of @entity68 passed the full range of appropriations bills			0
instead , they have relied on other ways to extend spending authority , such as continuing resolutions or omnibus measures that bundle together multiple appropriations bills			0
@entity1 's @entity92 and @entity93 contributed to this report .			0
