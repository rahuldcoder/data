@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed legislation friday temporarily restoring full funding to the @entity5 , breaking a political impasse and allowing roughly 4,000 furloughed federal employees to return to work			1
the measure also promises to restore tens of thousands of jobs in the construction industry and elsewhere tied to airport improvement projects put on hold as a result of the funding shortfall			2
the bill took less than one minute to pass a nearly empty @entity18 chamber friday morning			2
it was cleared with a legislative maneuver known as " unanimous consent , " which allows as few as two senators to approve a bill so long as no objections are filed			2
most members of @entity26 are currently away from @entity0 on their summer recess			0
the president hailed the agreement , noting that it removed " the uncertainty hanging over the jobs of thousands of hardworking @entity5 employees			1
" " this impasse was an unnecessary strain on local economies across the country at a time when we ca n't allow politics to get in the way of our economic recovery , " @entity2 said friday			1
" i 'm glad that this stalemate has finally been resolved			0
" the political differences that led to the funding shortfall , however , have not been resolved			2
democrats and @entity47 are still at sharp odds over whether to continue providing subsidies to smaller rural airports			1
the two parties also differ over whether to make it easier for airline employees to unionize			1
@entity26 will have to revisit the issue within six weeks to avoid another lapse in funding			2
outrage over @entity26 's decision to adjourn for the summer without providing adequate funding for the approximately 4,000 employees contributed to the push for at least a short - term resolution			1
transportation secretary @entity62 repeatedly took to the airwaves over the past several days , cajoling lawmakers to come back from their break and reach an agreement			0
for workers facing the possibility of lost wages for weeks to come , news of the breakthrough evoked an emotional response			0
@entity73 , an @entity5 inspector , cried when she learned of the deal			1
the tears are " out of relief , " @entity73 said , adding that while her post-graduate education taught her how government works , " what we are experiencing is outside of any textbook			0
" " this is a tremendous victory for @entity85 workers everywhere , " @entity62 said in a statement thursday			0
" from construction workers to our @entity5 employees , they will have the security of knowing they are going to go back to work and get a paycheck -- and that 's what we 've been fighting for			1
" since authorization for @entity5 funding expired in late july , the agency has also been unable to collect federal taxes on airline tickets -- leading to a revenue loss of approximately $ 30 million a day			1
if the dispute had continued until @entity26 returned in september , the federal government would have lost over $ 1 billion in revenue			2
senate majority leader @entity105 , @entity106 , had been in talks this week with @entity109 speaker @entity108 , @entity110 , and administration officials about how to resolve the funding impasse , a @entity18 @entity104 leadership aide told @entity1			0
@entity105 noted thursday that the agreement " does not resolve the important differences that still remain			0
" " but i believe we should keep @entity85 working while @entity26 settles its differences , and this agreement will do exactly that , " he said			0
the agreement is the 21st short - term funding extension for the @entity5			1
the @entity47 - led @entity109 previously passed a short - term extension , but it included a number of changes opposed in the @entity104 - controlled @entity18			1
one of the changes involves language in the @entity109 bill that would reduce or kill subsidies to rural airports , specifically targeting some in @entity106 , @entity125 and @entity126 -- three states with influential @entity104 senators			1
the @entity18 ultimately agreed to pass the @entity109 bill , but as part of thursday 's agreement , @entity62 will notify congressional leaders that he has the authority to grant waivers to affected community airports , which would exempt them from the subsidy cuts			1
while no specific exemptions are required , @entity62 's authority gives @entity104 the assurance that the disputed language they opposed can be overridden , the leadership aide noted			0
a larger dispute regarding the unionization of airline workers has not been addressed at all , however			1
@entity47 are livid over a recent ruling by the @entity147 that makes passage of a vote to unionize dependent only on getting more than 50 % support from those actually voting			2
for example , if a company has 1,000 workers but only 200 take part in the vote to unionize , the rule change would mean only 101 " yes " votes were needed for it to pass			0
under old rules , more than 50 % of all workers eligible to vote -- or in this example 501 " yes " votes -- would have been required for it to pass			0
workers who did n't cast ballots were counted as having voted " no , " making it more difficult for supporters to succeed			0
it remains unclear what -- if anything -- the divided @entity26 will ultimately do in response to the change			0
@entity1 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , and @entity178 and contributed to this report			0

new : @entity2 has signed a bill temporarily restoring full @entity5 funding
the legislation will allow roughly 4,000 federal employees to return to work
democrats and @entity47 remain divided over the unionization of airline employees
the two parties also are split over federal funding for smaller rural airports
