for @entity4 fans : do n't go looking for a brand new ridge to take over for the old one on @entity7 ' " @entity6			1
" once @entity4 ' last episode airs on sept. 14 , " @entity6 " has no plans to fill the void , the sudser 's head writer told tv guide			1
" @entity15 will not be dead or presumed dead , " said @entity14			1
" he will just not be in the picture			2
i do n't want to do a presumed death because i do n't want the story that follows to be all about @entity15			1
this will be a @entity22 story			2
@entity15 is a pivotal part of the show and he will be back in a matter of time ... and probably not all that much time			1
i will continue writing for the character			2
i 'm looking at this in two phases , really			2
there will be a period of time without @entity15 , which is where some new , interesting avenues for @entity22 will come into play			1
but at some point it will be necessary for @entity15 to return to the show			1
who will be playing the role at that point remains to be seen			2
" @entity0 broke the news last week that @entity4 has decided to leave @entity7 soap that he 's been on since its 1987 debut			1
he said this on his @entity47 page : " i want to make sure , without any doubt , that you guys all know how much i love you			0
your support during this time and hopefully beyond is everything			0
i ca n't say anything yet , but soon will explain			0
@entity56 in there with me , we have a wonderful new journey ahead of us			0
try and not be sad , angry , disappointed			0
. it 's been a great run and all good things end eventually			1
as this door closes , others are opening			0
i want you all to come with me through these new doors of opportunities and experience how cool it 's going to be			0
have faith , be strong , know i 'm eternally yours			0
" @entity4 played fashion magnate @entity15 -- one of the " core four " on bold that includes @entity75 as @entity76 , @entity77 as @entity78 , and @entity79 as @entity80			1
@entity14 also told @entity81 that " @entity4 's circumstances are unique " and that " what happened here will not be widespread			1
" ( translation : do n't look for any more unexpected departures )			0
@entity14 also said that once he does decide to fill @entity15 role , " i might go a little younger			2
but we 'll be true to the age range that 's been established			0
i do have people in mind in terms of a recast â € ” some very interesting people			0
" the head writer is n't giving up hope that @entity4 may reprise the role at a later date			1
