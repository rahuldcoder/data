-- @entity3 editor - in - chief @entity1 is defending the group 's recent leak and said it poses no real risk to soldiers or civilians in @entity10			1
" this material does n't mention any soldiers ' names , does n't mention any names of @entity10 civilians , " he told @entity0 's @entity12 monday			1
" the only thing at risk here is the reputations of the politicians and bureaucrats that put these soldiers into harm 's way -- and who put @entity10 into harm 's way , " he said			2
last week , the whistle - blower website published some 400,000 classified documents detailing the war in @entity10			2
they showed , @entity1 said , the deaths of 109,000 people , including soldiers and civilians			2
the release also revealed that roughly 15,000 more @entity10 civilians died during the conflict than previously thought , he said			0
the @entity42 has denounced the leak and has warned it could put @entity45 troops in greater danger -- an accusation @entity1 denied			1
earlier this year , @entity3 released more than 70,000 documents related to the war in @entity50			0
the website was heavily criticized then by the @entity45 government , the military and some human rights groups for failing to withhold civilians ' names , potentially putting them at risk of retaliation			1
@entity1 said @entity3 redacted the new round of documents , which included 391,832 reports			1
he also addressed an interview he gave last week to @entity0 's @entity64			1
@entity1 walked out after she started to ask questions about investigations in @entity68 , where he has been accused in separate cases of rape and molestation			1
@entity12 , who appeared to be watching footage of the old interview , momentarily thought @entity1 had walked out on him			1
" i did n't walk off @entity12 just then , but perhaps i should , " @entity1 said			1
he called such claims false and urged media groups not to conflate the content of the leak with " any sort of tabloid journalism			0
" " it should be obvious that these things are not in balance and they are not proportionate			0
it is not right to bring in sensational , and -- in fact false claims -- a relatively trivial matter compared to the deaths of 109,000 people , " @entity1 said			2
he also blasted an argument , which he said has been made by the @entity42 , that the recent leak does not contain any significant or new information			2
" of course , there 's nothing new to them in the material			0
but there 's a lot new to the rest of the world , " he said			0
@entity0 was offered access to the @entity10 documents in advance of the release but declined because of conditions that were attached to accepting			1
the @entity106 and @entity107 , a @entity108 newspaper , were among a handful of organizations provided early access to the documents			0
the @entity107 said the reports detail torture , summary executions and war crimes			0
@entity45 authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and murder by @entity10 police and soldiers , the documents show , it said			2
@entity42 spokesman @entity126 has said field reports do not contain evidence of war crimes			0
the @entity106 wrote that hundreds of reports of beatings , burnings and lashings suggested that " such treatment was not an exception			0
" most abuse cases contained in the new batch of leaks appear to have been ultimately ignored , the paper said .			0
