-- from time to time , in the years just after his television show was taken away from him , you might see him in the lobby of a @entity6 hotel or casino			1
it was always a startling sight			0
@entity9 , walking among the guests			1
in town for the weekend , more free hours on his hands than he would have liked , catching a few stage shows			0
it was n't that he had quickly become anonymous -- far from it			0
that kind of fame does n't fade , at least not for a long while			0
" the @entity22 " was gone , but the man survived			0
it had to have been so odd for him			0
" @entity9 , we miss you ! " a hotel guest might call out from across the lobby			1
great smile , by the way -- he was caricatured as being dour and stone - faced , but he had a smile that could light things up			2
so , with that smile and with a nod , he would acknowledge the person who had called to him			0
but it was a second set of people who caused a slightly different reaction from him			0
they could n't have intended to be hurtful			0
" @entity9 ! " they might call			1
" we watch you every sunday night at eight ! " and there would be something in his eyes			0
a little clenching of the jaw			0
he was off the air , against his will , and they did n't even realize it			0
today is the 50th anniversary of his greatest triumph			0
the first appearance of @entity57 on " the @entity22 " on february 9 , 1964 , drew the largest audience for any program -- 73 million people -- in the history of television up to that time			1
in recent days there has been much discussion of , and reminiscing about , the four young musicians who stepped onto @entity9 's stage that night			1
yet the fifth person on the stage was , in his own way , just as intriguing			0
he was a newspaper guy : a sportswriter , starting out , and eventually a @entity72 columnist who , in the 1930s , could never seem to step out of the shadow of the most successful @entity72 columnist , his rival -- it bordered on enmity -- @entity79			1
@entity79 , of the @entity80 , had become , through his national sunday night radio news - and - commentary program , the most talked - about and highly paid journalist in the @entity83			1
he was abrasive , imperious , ruthless in his wielding of power , and a dazzling , concise wordsmith between the dots of the items in his " @entity91 " column			0
@entity9 's " @entity94 " column in the @entity93 was punchy and knowing , but he was never going to become as big as @entity79			1
one evening in the late 1940s , @entity9 did his annual duty as master of ceremonies for something called the @entity99 , a dance competition sponsored by the @entity93			1
some executives at @entity102 , seeing him at the microphone , thought they might try him out as the host of a variety show on the new and untested medium of television			1
@entity108 was still king ; there was n't much risk in seeing what would work on tv			2
opinion : did @entity57 push black music aside ? and with that , everything was transformed			1
no one knew it at the time , but the dominance of newspapers , and of network radio , were about to end			0
@entity9 may have appeared stiff and lacking in personality on television , but his sunday night program featured some of the biggest and best show - business acts in the world , and his lack of magnetism , strangely , worked in his favor			1
two of the most oft - repeated quotes about him summed it up			0
from comedian @entity138 , a frequent @entity9 show guest : " @entity9 does nothing , but he does it better than anyone else in television			1
" from radio comedian and host @entity143 : " @entity9 will be around as long as someone else has talent			1
" @entity9 , who would become wealthy and instantly recognizable from coast to coast as his program became a national viewing habit , could afford to laugh along			2
his show went on the air in 1948 , and his success , as the enormous reach of television grew , left @entity79 in the dust			1
on tv , @entity9 did n't have to shout ; the fledgling medium did all the amplifying he needed			1
it was an era in which families still ate dinner together every sunday night , and then gathered around the television set to watch a variety of acts that @entity9 had deemed appropriate for all age groups			2
@entity79 could n't compete ; he might be able to give a plug in his column to the cast of " @entity166 " or to the comedy duo of @entity168 and @entity169 , but @entity9 could put the cast and the comedians on tv screens in every city and town in @entity83 , allowing the entire country to see them			1
even before february 9 , 1964 , his influence was being noted in remarkable ways			0
in the 1960 @entity72 musical ( later a hit movie ) " @entity182 , " the show - stopping song was " hymn for a sunday evening , " in which a fictional small - town @entity186 family , whose daughter supposedly was going to appear on his program , wore choir robes and , with religious ardor , sang in church - like tones : " @entity9 , @entity9 , we 're gon na be on @entity9			1
... " @entity195 : the @entity57 , bootlegs and @entity197 not bad , for a guy in near - constant stomach pain whose day job remained pounding out newspaper columns			2
and then came the first appearance by @entity57 , which propelled both the young singers and their host to almost unfathomable heights of renown			1
many people have likely forgotten that , in 1971 , @entity102 , having detected a softening in @entity9 's ratings , and a decline in the nation 's appetite for one - size - fits - all variety programs , canceled " the @entity22			2
" how could this happen , a mere seven years after he delivered to the network the biggest television audience ever ? there 's not much room for sentiment in business			0
seven - and - a - half years after @entity221 hit 60 home runs for the @entity223 , the team traded him to the @entity224			0
@entity9 was still under contract to @entity102 for occasional specials , but it was n't the same			2
he would die of esophageal cancer in 1974 , at the age of 73			0
" we miss you , @entity9 ! " the voices of the strangers would call to him , as if he was a family member , which , in a sense , he was			2
to encounter him on visits to @entity6 in those years just after his show was taken away , to witness him not on a glass screen but out among the people who once faithfully watched him , was to consider the swiftness and inevitability of change			2
less than a decade after that magical february night in 1964 , @entity9 the person was still around , but there was no longer any such thing as " the @entity22			1
" @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 were still around , but there was no longer any such thing as a band called @entity57			2
hymn for a sunday evening , indeed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			2

@entity258 : 50 years *ago* tv host @entity9 *introduced* @entity57 to @entity83 on his show
@entity9 an unlikely *impresario* ; he *'d* been @entity72 columnist competing with @entity79
@entity9 was stiff but had great guests , was *hugely* influential in @entity83 *culture* , says @entity258
@entity258 : less than decade after that 1964 show , @entity9 show and @entity57 were over
