@entity0 love beef ; we eat nearly 63 pounds per person each year			1
although that 's a lot , the amount is down from our 1976 high of 89 pounds			1
when buying beef , we tend to stick to what we know , which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef			1
even as an experienced chef , i often brought home familiar cuts			1
but researching my book , " @entity16 to meat , " led me to expand my repertoire to tasty , if less familiar , cuts like hanger steak and tri- tip. soon you can do the same , knowing which cuts to choose for maximum flavor and nutrition			1
a 3½ - ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron , zinc , and phosphorus			0
beef background humans began domesticating cattle , @entity34 , about 8,500 years ago			1
@entity35 first brought cattle to the @entity37 , and by 1690 , descendants of @entity35 ' cattle ranging in @entity40 were driven north and became known as @entity41			1
others arrived later with the colonists			0
@entity0 's top five cattle breeds are @entity45 from @entity46 , @entity47 from @entity48 , @entity49 from @entity50 , @entity51 from @entity52 , and @entity53 from @entity50			1
more than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in @entity0 , while most of the rest is @entity57 bred			1
the beef we eat comes mostly from 18 - to 24 - month - old steers , averaging about 1,000 pounds , and yielding about 450 pounds of meat			1
each is divided for wholesale into eight primals ( major portions ) : the chuck ( shoulder and upper ribs ) , the rib , the loin , the sirloin ( hip ) , the round ( upper leg ) , the brisket ( breast ) , the plate ( belly ) , and the small flank			0
organs like liver and kidneys are called variety meats			0
when evaluating your choices at the grocery store , here are a few key terms and facts to know : grain - finished : nearly 75 percent of @entity0 beef comes from cattle fattened on grain ( usually corn ) for three to six months in feedlots			1
since corn is not a natural part of a cow 's diet , cattle fed on it may experience stress and other ailments , so they are routinely treated with antibiotics			1
they also receive growth hormones to increase their size ( and value , as beef is sold by weight )			1
until recently , inexpensive corn has helped keep down the price of beef			1
grass - finished : grass - or pasture - finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes			1
their meat is lower in saturated fat , cholesterol , and calories than grain - finished			0
( because it is quite lean , cook rare to medium - rare for juiciness			0
) grass - fed beef has a distinct flavor , often described as bold , complex , and gamy			1
many people believe that grass - fed cattle are a more sustainable choice			1
however , raising grass - fed cattle is time - consuming and requires large open spaces , variables that raise its price			1
most is imported from @entity57 , followed by @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity136			0
aging : dry - aging is the traditional process preferred by many steak lovers			0
the concentrated , intense flavor of dry - aged beef develops as it hangs in special temperature - and humidity - controlled rooms from 10 days to six weeks			1
the longer the aging , the better the flavor and tenderness , but also the more the shrinkage as water evaporates and a dark crust develops , which must be cut away			0
about 90 percent of @entity0 beef is sold as large vacuum - packed cuts			1
during the average seven - day period the beef spends " in the bag , " it ages in a process called " wet - aging			1
" processing and packaging : until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half - or quarter - carcasses			1
@entity161 then began selling vacuum - packed beef , the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores			1
retailers refrigerated the boxes until needed , then opened the package and cut the meat into portions for sale			0
@entity172 came case - ready meat , which precluded the need for skilled butchers on - site in markets			0
leak - proof and easily stackable , case - ready packages are produced in @entity181 - inspected plants and have a longer shelf life			0
packages covered with a sealed layer of clear plastic are modified - atmosphere packages , which have a gas - filled space inside to help preserve freshness and color			0
nutrition fat content : the @entity181 defines " lean beef " as having less than 10 grams ( g ) of total fat , 4.5g or less of saturated fat , and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½ - ounce serving ( 100g ) of cooked beef			1
half of the fat is saturated and half is heart - healthy monounsaturated			0
there are 29 naturally lean cuts of beef , including many familiar to @entity206 readers , such as tenderloin , flank steak , and sirloin , as well as five lesser - known cuts			1
others , such as ribeye or chuck roast , naturally contain more fat , although it is similarly divided between saturated and monounsaturated			0
because lean beef contains less fat , it 's best cooked to medium - rare ( 145 ° f ) or medium ( 160 ° f ) to optimize tenderness			2
if using fattier cuts , slice away the outer rim of fat and cut or pull out any pockets of fat before cooking			2
for larger cuts , allow the fat to baste the meat while cooking , then trim away before eating , or skim it from the surface of braised dishes or stews			2
other nutrients : a 3½ - ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein -- more than half of the 50g recommended daily in a 2,000 - calorie - per - day diet			0
all beef is an excellent source of iron , zinc , and phosphorus			2
in general , the redder the meat , the more iron it contains ( beef liver has the most )			2
beef also contains thiamin , riboflavin , and niacin and is a rich source of @entity252 , found naturally only in animal foods			2
@entity254 : fat and @entity255 at the market inspection and grading : @entity181 inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state , which encompasses most of today 's supermarket beef			1
grading is voluntary and done by the same inspectors			0
the more marbling -- the small white flecks of fat within the muscles -- the higher the grade			0
three grades of beef are sold to consumers			2
only three percent is highly marbled @entity274 , sought after by top steak houses and butcher shops			0
about 57 percent is moderately marbled choice , the most common supermarket grade			0
the remaining 40 percent is lean select			0
private labels : supermarket chains and large food distributors also have developed private brands with their own specifications			0
the first such program began in 1978 with @entity45 , which must come from @entity45 cattle			1
@entity287 and @entity47 are two others			0
@entity289 : beef labeled " natural " must not contain any artificial ingredients and can not be more than minimally processed , such as ground beef			2
" @entity294 " beef must come from cattle raised and certified according to the @entity181 's @entity296			1
organic cattle must be fed 100 - percent organically and without antibiotics or hormones			2
both natural and organic beef can be either grass - or grain - finished			2
ways to save buy lean cuts			2
often , leaner cuts are cheaper than fatty ones			2
and when the fat cooks away , lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar			2
large or family - sized packages cost less per pound than smaller packages			0
divide into portions , and freeze the surplus			0
beef that has been presliced into steaks or made into patties costs more than less processed meat			2
buy bigger cuts , and do some of the preparation work yourself			2
@entity254 : beef on a budget but do n't go overboard			0
advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible , but you 'll likely have more meat than you can store			0
such a purchase may yield what one buyer describes as " cheap steak and expensive hamburger			0
