-- @entity1 was clearly conflicted as she sat down with me in a downtown @entity4 office to tell her story for the first time			1
there was so much the @entity9 socialite wanted to say about being sucked into the vortex of the gen. @entity12 scandal , about how she was really just good friends with another top general , @entity16 , and about what she sees as the media 's unfair treatment of her			1
if you recall , the scandal forced @entity12 to resign from his post as @entity24 director after the @entity25 , in reading e-mails sent to @entity1 , found he had had an extramarital affair with @entity28			1
@entity1 played another role in the scandal after the @entity25 investigated whether @entity16 , the top @entity31 commander in @entity32 , sent her inappropriate messages			1
in talking to me , she sensed she needed to be cautious			0
there were long pauses as she weighed her words , questions she refused to answer			0
she is not accustomed to dealing with the media and feels badly burned			1
watch : have the media unfairly tarnished @entity1 ? when i walked in for the exclusive sit - down for @entity42 , i realized i knew her face well , having seen the images replayed thousands of times			1
but how much did any of us really know about @entity1 ? already , some snark artists are accusing me of writing a " favorable " piece			2
my view is that , having been painted as the other other woman in a military sex scandal , @entity1 deserves the chance to tell her side of the story			1
watch : backstage at the inaugural ball , @entity57 's unsung army and i circle back to this question : what , exactly , did she do to deserve this ? there 's no evidence the married mother of three had an affair with anyone , unlike @entity28 , whose romantic liaison with @entity12 led to his downfall as @entity24 director			1
i ca n't vouch for everything @entity1 told me			2
she would n't show me the e-mails that she received anonymously from @entity71 , which @entity1 described as threatening			2
but she did say she was " terrified " and believed she had no choice but to contact the @entity25			0
( federal prosecutors have declined to bring charges against @entity28 over the matter )			0
watch : the media 's failure on the @entity79 hoax nor did @entity1 show me any of the e-mails she sent to @entity16			1
we have only her word that they were merely friendly , rather than sexy or flirtatious , as some unnamed government officials have claimed			0
but @entity1 sent and received those messages on a @entity87 account she shares with her husband , as she has no separate e-mail address			2
that should tell us something			0
she even says @entity16 's wife was copied on many of the notes			0
oh , and she says there were n't 30,000 of them			0
a few hundred , maybe			0
to some extent , @entity1 bears the blame for the unflattering media portrait of her because she remained silent for nearly three months			1
i think she understands that now			0
watch : @entity57 's digital guru talks about unplugging from the net but when she told me how dozens of paparazzi ruined her daughter 's seventh birthday party by invading her front lawn , i felt embarrassed for the profession			0
even as a sideshow to the @entity12 fiasco , the @entity1 saga was a legitimate story , with two top generals coming under scrutiny			1
but after spending a couple of hours with her , i ca n't say we handled it terribly well			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			2

@entity121 : @entity1 spoke out for the first time about the @entity12 scandal
@entity1 , cast as the " other other woman , " felt badly burned by the media , he says
@entity121 says there was no evidence that @entity1 had an affair with anyone
@entity121 : @entity1 , sucked into vortex of scandal , deserves to tell her story
