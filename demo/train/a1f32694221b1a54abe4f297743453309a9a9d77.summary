@entity1 , @entity0 -- as airlines slash flights and cut spending in the wake of rising fuel prices , rail travel across @entity4 is entering into a period of renewal			1
@entity12 launched services from its new @entity1 station , @entity15 in november 2007			0
by 2010 , the continent 's rail operators expect 25 million passengers to be using its high - speed networks , up from around 14 million today			1
and this staggering growth is expected to spill into the next decade			0
this week , @entity21 , the owner and operator of @entity25 's rail infrastructure , has commissioned a study that could lead to the biggest overhaul of the nation 's rail industry since the 19th century			2
the study will consider five new intercity lines running north and west of @entity1			0
new lines , built alongside existing tracks , could accommodate high - speed trains similar to @entity38 's tgv that travels at 186 miles per hour ( 300 km / h )			1
if approved , journey times between @entity1 and @entity40 could be slashed to just over one hour , and two hours between @entity1 and @entity41			0
the cost of such expansion is large , says a @entity21 spokesperson , but crucial to absorb the nation 's increasing demand for rail travel			1
despite complaints over overcrowding and affordability of rail travel in @entity25 , passenger numbers have soared by 40 percent to 1.13 billion journeys a year in the last decade			1
and if growth continues as predicted , @entity21 expects many lines to be full by 2025			2
the popularity for rail is driven partly by a growing determination among passengers to become more environmentally friendly			0
a journey on high - speed train eurostar between @entity1 and @entity62 generates one - tenth of the carbon dioxide produced by an equivalent flight , according to independent research commissioned by @entity12			1
rail 's city - center - to - city - centre service is also becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to flying			2
research has shown that business travelers are now willing to travel up to four hours on rail because of the increased productivity versus the airlines			0
leisure travelers are prepared to go further , using trains on journeys of up to six hours			0
if plans for new high - speed routes across @entity25 are agreed , the earliest construction could begin is 2014 , says @entity21			1
but expansion is already underway across the @entity4 rail network to handle growing passenger numbers			2
@entity25 's first high - speed rail line was opened by @entity12 last november			1
this links the new @entity15 station in central @entity1 with @entity62 in just 2 hours 15 minutes and @entity86 in 1 hour 51 minutes			0
last june , @entity87 opened in @entity38 , slashing journey times between @entity62 and @entity89 to 45 minutes from 90 minutes , and from @entity62 to @entity90 in 2 hour 20 minutes instead of 4 hours			2
this line opens development of a 1,500 - km @entity4 railway line intended to link @entity62 and @entity94 via @entity90 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			2
other upcoming high - speed rail routes include the @entity99 between @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 ; a number of @entity104 ( @entity104 ) high - speed rail links between @entity106 and @entity108 's provincial cities ; and a high - speed connection between @entity108 and @entity110			1
new high - speed lines are also expected in @entity112 in early 2011			1
and if plans for a rail tunnel under the @entity116 from @entity108 to @entity117 are finalized , trains could link @entity4 and @entity118 by 2025			2
the efficiency of trans - @entity4 rail travel will be further boosted following the formation of @entity123 , an alliance of high - speed rail operators across western @entity4			1
these include @entity126 from @entity127 , @entity128 in @entity38 , @entity12 as well as operators from @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity101			0
at the moment making connections , for example between a @entity12 service from @entity1 to @entity62 and then to a @entity135 across @entity38 or an @entity137 high - speed train through @entity127 can be complicated			1
the new alliance , that works like a code - sharing airline alliance , means travelers can book tickets on a multilingual website to 100 cities , rising to 400 by 2020			0
the alliance will also cut waiting time between connections			0
and frequent business travelers will eventually be able to use a ' train mile ' program across the entire network			0
@entity123 currently does not include operators in @entity112 and @entity108 where high - speed networks are less developed			1
but more train operators are expected to join in the future			0
what 's more , legislation approved by the @entity156 last year that requires national rail systems to open up to operators from other countries by 2010 , will further push development of a @entity4 network of high - speed rail			1
as this network develops , and as appeal of air travel falters , riding the rails between @entity62 and @entity94 , or @entity168 and @entity86 may not seem like such a bad idea after all .			0

@entity4 rail travel is having a *renaissance* boosted by new high - speed links
@entity21 will conduct a *review* into building new rail lines across @entity25
new high - speed links *recently* opened between @entity178 and @entity4 and into east @entity38
