this one is different : the suspect is an ex-cop with an ax to grind , and he 's allegedly targeting other cops			2
this one crosses the blue line , the one cops think separates the good guys from the bad			0
this one picks at one of @entity3 's barely healed scabs , the scandals of the @entity28			1
they began in march 1991 , when @entity30 videotaped a gaggle of police officers kicking @entity30 and beating him with batons after a high - speed freeway chase			1
it ended , or so most people thought , in 2009 when a federal judge lifted a consent decree that threatened severe sanctions if the @entity28 did not reform itself			2

it is the nation 's third - largest police force , but has far fewer officers per capita and square mile than the two largest forces , in @entity56 and @entity57			1
until about 15 years ago , the department 's officers where overwhelmingly white			2
a couple of decades of reform seemed to make things better			0

" the department has not changed since the @entity88 and @entity30 days , " he wrote			1
" it has gotten worse			0
the consent decree should never have been lifted			0
" @entity78 is angry about being fired by the @entity28			1
he is articulate and lucid enough to trigger flashbacks to a time not so long ago when patrol officers broke their world into two categories : " blue and everybody else			0
" @entity30 , who died last year , was beaten by @entity28 patrol officers on march 3 , 1991 while a supervisor stood by			1
three officers and a sergeant were tried a year later , and acquitted of the most serious charges			0
the @entity28 watched as parts of the city erupted in rioting that left 53 dead and damaged $ 1 billion worth of property			2
an investigation revealed that racism , brutality and adversarial attitudes were so ingrained that it did n't even occur to officers to hide them			0
the inquiry documented a culture in which cops openly talked with each other about beating suspects -- " attitude adjustments , " they called it -- and labeled a group of african - americans as " gorillas in the mist , " a popular movie title during the @entity30 era			1
six years after the riots , another scandal exposed more corruption and even deeper cover - ups , implicating members of an elite anti-gang unit at the @entity28 's @entity88 , home to some of the city 's most vicious gangs			1

usually , though , other officers are quick to close ranks and shun a perceived " rat			0
" he told the story of an officer who testified at the @entity30 trial as an expert on the use of force			1
the man said he believed the officers had , indeed , employed excessive force			1

he wrote that he does not expect to survive his vengeful rampage			0
last weekend , a couple was found shot to death in @entity219 , a suburban @entity220 community south of @entity3 that is home to a college campus			0
investigators tied the slayings to @entity78 ; his manifesto seems to confirm the connection : it says the slain woman 's father represented @entity78 , unsuccessfully , at a hearing before an @entity28 disciplinary committee in 2008			1
so far , the bloodshed seems to be taking place outside the city limits			0
it covers a wide area around @entity3 , with incidents reported from @entity237 in the south to the mountain resort of @entity240 in the east			0
three @entity243 police officers were shot , one fatally , by a man police say was @entity78			2

people who have invested years watching the @entity28 -- including attorneys , legal analysts and the @entity281 reporters who have covered the department -- say it has indeed changed since the early 1990s			1
but they also agree that its past is fertile territory for anyone with a grudge against the department			0

the @entity30 and @entity88 scandals brought to light racism and corruption that had existed in the department			1
