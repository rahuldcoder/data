@entity0 -- dissident @entity3 artist @entity2 , whose artwork is shown in museums around the world , is taking a different direction with his latest project -- a heavy metal album			1
@entity2 wrote and sang each of the nine tracks on the debut album , which is called " @entity16 " after a poem by @entity15 poet @entity14 , and will be released next month			1
" the lyrics are about the current political situation , " he told @entity1 by telephone from @entity18			0
one song is about @entity22 , the blind activist who fled to the @entity24 embassy in @entity18 after escaping from house arrest last year			0
another mentions @entity27 , the police chief who also sought shelter with @entity24 officials last year , in @entity30 , a move which exposed the scandal engulfing disgraced @entity3 politician @entity33 and his wife , now convicted murderer , @entity35			2
@entity2 : despite flaws , @entity24 should be proud outspoken and provocative , @entity2 is perhaps best known for his work on the famous " @entity40 " stadium built for the @entity39			2
his critical stance toward the @entity3 government gained attention after the 2008 @entity45 earthquake that left nearly 90,000 dead , including many children who died when their shoddily - constructed schools collapsed			2
a recent exhibition of his work at the @entity51 in @entity52 featured hundreds of children 's backpacks lashed together in the shape of a snake , which @entity2 said represented the bags left behind by the students			0
while a departure from his acclaimed sculpture and installations , the album is not his first foray into the world of music -- last october he filmed a parody of " @entity68 , " the surprise worldwide hit by @entity71 rapper @entity70			0
in that clip , @entity2 limited his musical involvement to dancing , but other clips can be found on the internet of the artist flexing his vocal cords			1
@entity2 told @entity1 the decision to branch out into music stemmed from his detention in 2011 when his guards would ask him to sing a tune to pass the time			1
@entity2 was taken into custody in april and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists			0
he was accused of evading a huge amount of taxes , charges @entity2 has said were trumped up			0
@entity2 was released but with heavy restrictions on his movements and the @entity3 government still holds his passport			1
while @entity2 describes the tracks as " heavy metal " or " hard rock " , it was an encounter with pop star @entity97 that encouraged him to finally complete the album			1
@entity97 dedicated his performance in @entity18 in november to @entity2 , who at the time said he was deeply touched by the gesture			1
@entity2 cited few musical influences and said he knew little about @entity105 popular music despite a stint living in @entity107 in the 1980s : " when i grew up all the music we had was revolutionary stuff			2
" @entity2 said he would try to release the album in @entity3 next month , along with a music video , but he was gloomy about its prospects			1
" i am completely censored , " he said			0
" i will put it online so people can download it but i think the authorities will just delete it			0
