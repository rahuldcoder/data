-- a few minutes of what was considered online fun , and one person is dead			1
another is convicted of invasion of privacy and bias intimidation			1
when @entity10 student @entity8 set up a spycam to catch roommate @entity12 in a same - sex romantic moment , and when he tweeted about it and his plans to do it again , little did he think that @entity18 would commit suicide or that he would face serious jail time and deportation			1
@entity22 is learning his lesson the hard way			0
there are lessons for all of us : what you do online can hurt people			1
despite the adage about sticks and stones , words can and do hurt -- especially when anyone can publish information that reaches millions			2
the @entity37 is full of homophobic , racist , anti-semitic and misogynistic content			0
at a minimum , hate speech is online pollution , but it can go much further			1
it reinforces stereotypes and strengthens the belief that singling out " the other " for abuse is acceptable			0
hate speech can harden low self - esteem and intimidate its targets -- and even lead people to commit suicide			1
online bystanders have a responsibility			1
some students in the @entity10 dorm were amused by @entity22 's spycam - @entity56 scheme			1
they should have been outraged , and they should have done something about it			0
" if you see something , say something " is not an admonition restricted to the security realm			0
tools are online for each of us to flag and report content that is objectionable			2
many online companies have staffs to review such reports and to take action , from removing the offensive content to ejecting the person who posted it			1
each of us should take responsibility to combat hate - filled content			1
speak up : clicking to report hate speech to an online host is not all we can do			1
justice @entity85 , in a 1927 @entity84 case , extolled the virtues of " counter-speech " to address objectionable speech			2
that pre-internet admonition applies full force to online messages today			2
hate speech legitimizes discrimination , and many of the people who post it believe no one objects			1
speak up to counter the lies of hate speech or the inappropriate online conduct directed at minorities			1
just as the @entity37 provides thoughtless haters with broadcasting tools , each of us has those same tools at our disposal			0
a little counter-speech can go a long way			0
it 's time to get serious about cyber-literacy and ethics			0
the lack of education in schools about the rules that apply to online posting is appalling			2
kids are left to their own devices , literally , with little guidance			2
given the power in everyone 's hands to cause injury -- and to be injured -- schools should provide serious discussions of what is appropriate online behavior			1
we are well past the time when adults can think of themselves as the digital immigrants who do n't fully understand new technologies , compared with their kids , the digital natives who better understand the online world			1
@entity134 is a shared responsibility			2
discussions about privacy usually revolve around consumer privacy and protection			0
but in this era of social media , when everyone can be a publisher and broadcaster , individual responsibility to respect privacy should be the focus			2
most people would know that secretly setting up a webcam to spy on someone is wrong			0
but posting embarrassing photos and videos and making thoughtless comments can be a wrongful invasion of privacy as well			0
each of us has a responsibility to consider the privacy implications of what we do online			1
finally , while young straight people today are much more accepting of gay people , an undercurrent of homophobia remains			0
@entity22 most likely would not have set up a webcam to catch his roommate making out with a girl , nor would he have tweeted about it			0
in some quarters , the put - down " that 's so gay " is still common parlance			0
many think of gays and lesbians as " the other " and fair game for jokes			0
racist and anti-semitic jokes still have currency			0
@entity22 may have thought what he was doing to his roommate was funny , but he now knows it was anything but , for @entity18 and for himself			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity10 tragedy after webcam intrusion : one person convicted , another dead
@entity184 : respecting others ' privacy online , fighting hate speech our responsibility
@entity184 writes : our online behavior can hurt ourselves and others , and it can even lead to suicide
we must speak up against hate speech , he says , and educate kids in wise behavior
