as they beat @entity4 by 22 runs in the final of the @entity7 on sunday			1
@entity8 with home advantage and with an in - form @entity10 in their ranks fell well short in their pursuit of the 168 for five wickets posted by @entity17 in their allocated overs			1
@entity19 was the star for @entity20 with an unbeaten 57 in their knock and a tight spell of bowling including the wicket of lower - order dangerman @entity26			1
he posted a blistering 72 - run stand with @entity17 and @entity29 captain @entity28 ( 27 ) but their total still looked only respectable with the likes of @entity10 and @entity33 in the @entity8 ranks			2
but off - spinner @entity34 immediately piled on the pressure with an opening maiden over to @entity37 , who fell in the next over to @entity39 paceman @entity38 as he edged to @entity28			0
@entity10 and @entity40 ( 27 ) shared a 66 - run stand but just when they were upping the ante , @entity40 was run out and @entity19 , introduced for the first time in the 12th over , also got rid of @entity26 in the same over			2
the killer blow came in the 15th over when left - arm spinner @entity47 had @entity10 caught for 48 on the boundary and then removed @entity49			0
with the @entity4 needing 55 from the last three overs , the crowd were silent until @entity33 , who had been mysteriously kept back , smashed @entity38 for two sixes and two fours in the 18th which yielded 22 runs			0
however , both @entity56 ( 21 ) and @entity33 fell in the penultimate over from @entity58 and the game was up for @entity8 with the final action played out in near silence among the capacity crowd .			0
