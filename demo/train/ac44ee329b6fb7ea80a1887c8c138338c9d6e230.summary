-- apps have changed the way we travel			1
from helping us pack to checking - in , and from coping with jetlag to booking a hotel once we 've landed -- these handy tools can be used every step of the way			2
with relaxing visions of mobile convenience in mind , i thought traveling from @entity14 to @entity15 using only apps would be stress - free and easy , but it did n't quite work out that way			1
see also : the future of flight is shape - shifting engines i began my journey by using the private car service , @entity24 , to take me to @entity25 where i was to catch the @entity26			2
@entity24 is free to download and all you need to do is pre-register your credit card details			0
it will then tell you how far away the closest car is to you , along with a photo of the driver			0
so far , so good			0
all - aboard next up was the @entity26 app. this turned out to be the easiest facility i used			0
again with pre-registered credit card details it only took a couple of minutes to book my ticket			0
the qr code turned my phone into my ticket which saved me scrambling at the ticket machine on the platform			0
feeling quite pleased with the journey so far , my bubble was truly burst when i attempted to check - in with the @entity50 app. this was the first time i used it as i usually check - in online the night before			1
to continue in the spirit of booking on the move , i tried to check - in whilst on the @entity26 , which was unsuccessful due to patchy signal going underground			1
once at @entity58 's @entity57 , the app still did n't work			1
every time i tried to check - in , i had to fill out my additional passenger information which took a lot of time tapping in the same information			0
after eight attempts , i tried the self - check - in kiosk which said i had already checked in ! see also : the $ 1 trillion business travel industry the problem was it did n't give me an option to print my boarding pass			1
great , i thought -- i have n't even made it onto the plane and i 've failed			0
then , just as my passport was going to be swiped at a check - in desk , the screen on my phone started refreshing and then suddenly -- my boarding pass appeared			0
the app challenge continues ! @entity15 - ward bound coming out of arrivals at @entity77 , i did n't even have to look at my phone as i recognized @entity78 , my @entity24 driver from the photo provided			1
no name boards , no phone calls -- i just waved and said " you must be @entity78 ? " i started looking for a hotel to stay once we reached the @entity85 in central @entity15 -- i had downloaded @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 to help with the task			1
as i perused with patience , looking at the photos and the room features , i suddenly began to get text messages informing me how much i had spent on data roaming			0
$ 5 ... $ 10 ... $ 30 ... $ 50 " ahhh it keeps going up and up and i have n't found anything yet ! " i had failed to book a room at not one but two hotels			1
the rooms had gone after i tried to process my payment and there was no - one to complain to			1
i successfully booked the third hotel i tried -- and just when i thought it was too good to be true			0
it was ! the hotel had oversold the rooms and they had moved me to their sister hotel up the road which they said was better			0
unfortunately it was n't and in the less desirable area of @entity112			0
out and about by the time i had checked in it was too late to go hunting for food and try out some restaurant apps suggestions via @entity117			1
i wish there had also been more time to try out some of the city guide apps as well as the @entity121 app -- which allows you to see monuments like the @entity124 in their former glory			2
see also : apps and scanners ease travel expense pain @entity130 apps are still in their infancy so i will definitely be keeping an eye on how these develop and try them out			1
overall , my apps experience was n't quite what i expected it to be			2
some were simple to use whilst others were more time - consuming and fiddly			2
to avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end i had spent $ 160 -- i would use apps that are quick and easy			2
that way you 'll have more chance of staying travel appy !			2

*smartphone* and *tablet* apps have simplified the travel process
travelers can arrange the flights , hotels and restaurants whilst on the move
