partially upheld the @entity8 star 's ban for biting an opponent on thursday			1
the striker was suspended from all football - related activity for four months -- preventing him from even training -- after he bit @entity14 defender @entity13 on the shoulder during a @entity17 group game in @entity18 in late june , and banned for nine international matches			0
@entity20 - based @entity5 heard the 27 - year - old 's case last week as he appealed against the punishment imposed by soccer 's world governing body @entity26			1
@entity1 and his legal team had spent five hours before a three - man @entity5 appeal panel in @entity29 in an attempt to reduce the suspension , but the ban on playing was upheld along with a fine of $ 111,000			1
however , @entity5 said he is free to take part in other football - related duties " such as training , promotional activities and administrative matters " and confirmed @entity1 would be available to play friendly matches for @entity3 and the @entity8 national team during his suspension			1
" the @entity43 found that the sanctions imposed on the player were generally proportionate to the offense committed , " the ruling stated			1
" it has however considered that the stadium ban and the ban from ' any football - related activity ' were excessive given that such measures are not appropriate to sanction the offense committed by the player and would still have an impact on his activity after the end of the suspension			1
" @entity1 's ban from competitive matches expires on october 25 , and @entity3 's next match is the " @entity63 " grudge match with rival @entity62 the following day			1
in a statement on its website , the @entity65 giants said @entity1 would join a training session friday morning and will be officially unveiled during monday 's @entity70 match at the @entity71 against @entity72			2
because he is now free to play in friendly games , @entity1 could also make his first appearance for @entity3 in that match against the @entity77 club side			1
@entity8 also has three friendly internationals scheduled before the end of october so its star striker is available to play against @entity81 on september 5			2
but @entity1 will still have eight matches of his nine - game ban from competitive internationals to serve and @entity8 @entity86 president @entity85 said he was disappointed with the @entity5 ruling			1
" it 's a cultural matter			0
the way we live football in @entity92 is different to @entity93 , for us there are things which are normal and which deserve sanctions , but not such harsh ones , " he said			0
but leading @entity4 sports lawyer @entity97 said the @entity5 decision was to be expected			0
" i find it logical that the player is allowed to train with his colleagues and he can be presented by the club , " he told @entity0			0
" the infraction happened while playing for @entity8 , and i think it 's logical that the ban on playing for his country ( in competitive matches ) still stands			2
" the @entity13 incident was the third time @entity1 had bitten a player -- he had previously been banned for similar transgressions while playing for @entity114 club @entity113 and @entity116 side @entity115			2
with @entity1 sidelined , @entity8 lost its last - 16 match to @entity118 and was knocked out of the @entity17			2
@entity1 eventually apologized for his actions , but lost his appeal to @entity26 over the sanctions before deciding to take the matter to @entity5 -- an independent " last resort " body that deals with sporting disputes			1
@entity26 's punishment did not stop @entity3 signing @entity1 from @entity115 in a $ 127 million deal last month which will give the club a star - studded attack when he finally lines up alongside @entity130 and @entity131			1
@entity1 was top scorer in the @entity133 last season , winning the two major player of the year awards for his outstanding performances in helping @entity115 to second place and a return to the @entity138			0
he suffered a knee injury at the end of the season which threatened his participation in the @entity17			0
he missed @entity8 's first game but recovered to score two goals that ended @entity146 's hopes of reaching the knockout stages as the @entity92 on 2 - 1			2
but in the final group game , his bite on @entity13 -- captured by television cameras -- provided the most notorious moment of the @entity17 , overshadowing a 1 - 0 victory by @entity8 that eliminated @entity14			0
in other football news thursday , @entity93 's appeals panel has upheld the decision to expel @entity156 from the @entity138 for fielding an ineligible player			1
@entity156 won its third qualifying round match against @entity160 champions @entity159 6 - 1 on aggregate , but brought on defender @entity162 with four minutes remaining of the second leg			0
he had been given a three - game ban after being sent off in @entity156 's final @entity166 game last season and duly sat out two matches in the second qualifying round and the first leg of the tie against @entity159			0
but @entity156 had failed to officially register @entity162 as a player , leading to the @entity93 action			0
the punishment means it will drop to the @entity166 with @entity159 reinstated to the final qualifying round of the @entity138 , but @entity156 club officials said they would be making a further appeal to the @entity5 to overturn the decision .			0

@entity1 's " biting ban " is upheld by independent appeals panel
@entity8 forward can not play for new club @entity3 until late october
however , he can now take part in training and promotional activities
@entity5 rules that @entity26 's sanctions were " generally proportionate to the offense committed "
