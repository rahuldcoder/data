@entity0 , @entity1 -- a proposed partnership between the @entity5 government and @entity6 is stoking fears in @entity5 that the country 's literary treasures will fall under commercial control of a @entity12 technology company			1
@entity13 , the @entity5 minister of culture , has said that @entity6 came to @entity5 with " the attitude of a conqueror " signing " unacceptable " and " one - sided " deals			1
he told @entity18 newspaper that the deals involved " excessive confidentiality , impossible exclusivity and casual -- even leonine -- clauses on copyright			0
" for some , however , @entity13 's reaction is puzzling -- including one of the libraries concerned			0
believing that access to their archives can promote @entity5 culture , the city of @entity30 's library has signed an agreement with @entity6 , hoping to scan as many as 500,000 books in 10 years			1
the first text uploaded online was a rare 16th century collection of doomsday predictions from the @entity5 philosopher @entity41			1
under the @entity43 contract , @entity6 will scan its books and manuscripts for free			1
in exchange , the library gives @entity6 the right to use the scanned documents commercially for the next 25 years			1
" i find it normal and good that that book is scanned in @entity30 where it was written			2
so i do n't see the problem between using a method developed in the @entity12 to promote heritage and culture in @entity5 or @entity57			2
i do n't understand the problem , " @entity58 , director of the @entity43 , told @entity2			0
the library 's collection includes national literary treasures and collectibles , such as a 16th century bible , in 12 languages			1
that means security is a top concern and @entity6 is therefore keeping the location of its scanning secret			2
" by putting them on the @entity75 , much larger circles of society , including non-specialists , can read these works and enjoy them and find them useful , " @entity58 added			0
" they are works that touch upon all sorts of subjects of life , of the universe , " he continued			0
" they concern everyone and so they matter to everyone , and so they have to be made available to everyone by scanning them			0
" at the national level , officials like @entity13 have expressed a strong preference to keep the digitizing an internal affair , and even develop a rival to @entity6			2
so far the government has earmarked $ 1 billion dollars to boost its own online database , known as @entity98			0
however , in january , an independent review for the @entity5 culture ministry criticized the lack of progress made by @entity98 , and recommended a public - private partnership with @entity6			1
since starting in 1997 , @entity98 has scanned less than one million documents and about 145,000 books , according to the @entity108 's @entity107 newspaper			0
at the same time , the report concluded that deals between @entity6 and libraries around @entity57 were disproportionately favorable for @entity6 , and a better distribution would need to be brokered without the exclusivity clauses for @entity5			1
@entity114 , the head of @entity115 in @entity5 , has said in the past that exclusivity was needed to guarantee a return on the investment of scanning , but that he welcomes a partnership with the state			0
in a statement emailed to @entity2 , @entity114 reiterated " @entity6 's commitment to work more than ever in partnership with publishers and other actors in the book industry to help create a virtuous ecosystem for books in the digital era			2
" currently @entity6 has seven library partners in @entity57 , including @entity30			1
it is only scanning out - of - copyright works in @entity57			0
while the final details remain to be hammered out , the pace of @entity6 's process makes it hard to eschew			0
@entity6 has already scanned more than 12 million books into its global index since the @entity115 project launched at the @entity141 in 2004 .			2
