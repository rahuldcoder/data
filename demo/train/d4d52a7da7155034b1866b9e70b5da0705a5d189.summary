@entity0 -- @entity0 gov. @entity2 is asking state legislators to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that are in public view			1
saying the aim was to avoid unnecessary misdemeanor charges against thousands of @entity10 -- " disproportionately black and @entity12 youth , " according to a statement from the governor 's office -- the legislation " brings consistency and fairness " to @entity0 's marijuana laws			2
" there is a blatant inconsistency			0
if you possess marijuana privately it is a violation , if you show it in public it 's a crime			1
it 's inconsistent the way it has been enforced , " @entity2 told reporters at a press conference in @entity30 on monday			2
in 1977 , @entity0 's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $ 100 for first - time offenders -- as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view			1
if the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a so - called police " stop and frisk " -- it becomes a @entity52 misdemeanor			1
selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime , and @entity2 is not suggesting changing that			1
" the statute as currently written unnecessarily subjects tens of thousands of people to criminal arrest and prosecution for very small quantities of marijuana , " said @entity58 member @entity57			2
" the overwhelming majority of people who have been arrested as a result of the way that the statute is currently written come from the black and @entity74 community , " @entity57 said , adding that statistics and studies show that marijuana possession and use " is far more racially diverse			0
" according to data released by the governor 's office , 2,000 arrests for small amounts of marijuana were made in 1990			1
in 2011 , over 50,000 arrests were made			0
fifty percent of those arrested were under 25 years old , and 82 % were black or @entity74			0
less than 10 % were ever convicted of a crime			0
" the human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious , " said manhattan district attorney @entity84 , supporting @entity2 's proposal			2
" the simple and fair change proposed by @entity90 will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems , and , frankly , it is the right thing to do			0
" according to the governor 's office , 94 % of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in @entity10 , and mayor @entity102 , the @entity103 and police commissioner @entity104 have come under fire in recent years for the department 's much - criticized " stop and frisk " policy			1
@entity102 wants to ban large sodas " overly punitive charges have a harmful effect on our justice system			0
they can ruin lives , waste taxpayer money on unneeded trials , and breed distrust between communities and law enforcement , " said @entity112 , @entity0 state director for the @entity113			0
last year @entity104 issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations , rather than misdemeanors , for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches , and monday , @entity127 issued a statement in support of @entity2 's comments			1
" the governor 's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner 's directive , and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the @entity103 will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana , " he said			2
" thanks to the @entity103 , our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions			0
" at the press conference monday , @entity104 said , " i was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the ( @entity150 ) council that the @entity151 was making , quote , ' too many ' arrests for small amounts of marijuana			1
and my response to them , was , ' well , your option is to go to @entity30 and get the law changed ' -- better that than having @entity10 police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written , and as it is still written			0

a 1977 law makes private possession of 25 grams or less a non-criminal violation
but if the marijuana is publicly *visible* , the same amount is a @entity52 misdemeanor
@entity2 is asking that small amounts even in public view be decriminalized
selling and smoking or burning marijuana would still be a crime
