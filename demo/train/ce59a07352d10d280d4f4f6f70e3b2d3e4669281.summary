@entity0 -- for more than a week into a government shutdown , @entity2 kept a low profile amid the political uproar			1
when he finally emerged , the time was ripe for someone with his conservative cred and fiscal bona fides to step in and try to corral his bucking @entity9			1
while a group of conservatives were driving the agenda in the quagmire over spending , @entity15 and the looming debt limit , @entity2 dropped an op - ed in the @entity18 outlining the @entity9 path forward			1
yes , he did stir up divisions between tea party conservatives and establishment @entity9 lawmakers , but he also enabled party leaders to grab the reins and regain control of their caucus			0
prologue : @entity2 's strategy to remain silent			2
in new book , @entity2 asks ' where do we go from here ? ' as @entity33 sen. @entity32 staged a public fight over defunding president @entity36 's signature health care law , which led to the shutdown , @entity2 tread lightly			1
for instance , @entity1 has asked every member of @entity40 if he or she would support a government funding or debt ceiling bill with no strings attached -- something @entity36 and @entity45 are demanding			0
@entity2 's office chose not to comment			2
his recent reticence was more noticeable because the issues front and center now fell into his wheelhouse			0
act i : the adult in the room @entity54 , former spokesman for 2012 @entity9 presidential nominee @entity55 , said that @entity2 speaks about issues when necessary			1
" he intends to be the adult in the room when needed , " @entity54 said			0
" he felt that it was important for him to speak up to address the seemingly never - ending stalemate that we 're witnessing in @entity0			2
" supporters stand by representatives , and government shutdown a source told @entity1 this was the plan all along			0
@entity2 thought the better issue to demand concessions from the president was around the debt ceiling and that he 'd play a larger role in that debate			2
@entity2 's low profile , however , was evident on thursday when @entity9 emerged from a conference to announce what they planned to take to the @entity75			1
as nearly a dozen @entity75 leaders approached the microphone to announce a deal , @entity2 refrained from speaking			0
he stood in the background , barely in the frame of the television cameras			0
@entity82 : @entity2 's backlash @entity2 , who was previously considered the conservative knight in shining armor for his fiscal policies , took a beating from the home team when he released his op - ed urging the terms of negotiations revolve around the deficit and entitlement programs			1
@entity94 , founder of the @entity0 - based @entity96 @entity95 , told @entity1 that she is skeptical of @entity2 's plan			1
" @entity2 is a numbers guy ; i just do n't like his numbers , " @entity94 said			0
and a spokeswoman for @entity32 noticed something else that irritated conservatives			0
" there is one big work missing from this op - ed. it 's start with an @entity105 and ends with @entity106 , " she tweeted			1
@entity2 was forced to go on defense instead of push his agenda			0
@entity2 responds to criticism over op - ed appearing on conservative talk show " @entity111 's morning in @entity113 , " @entity111 asked @entity2 if dismantling @entity15 was no longer a priority			1
@entity2 insisted that it still was			0
" @entity15 's an entitlement just like any other entitlement , " @entity2 said , according to @entity116			2
" if you look at the op - ed , i say we have to - ultimately we have to rethink all of our nation 's health care laws			1
" @entity123 : @entity2 's defense but @entity2 has some support on this matter			2
@entity128 chairman @entity127 echoed @entity2 's defense , and said the op - ed included " @entity15 , " even though it did n't specifically mention it			1
and @entity131 sen. @entity131 of @entity132 called @entity2 's proposal a " must read			2
" @entity134 : @entity2 's impact one day later , however , @entity2 's timely action has proved significant			1
@entity9 leadership has now effectively transitioned @entity9 negotiation demands away from health care			1
@entity9 leadership said the proposal they are bringing to @entity36 is a discussion on " an array of issues			2
" missing from the proposal were the words " health care " or " @entity15			1
" opinion : goodbye to the strategy @entity9 knew was a fantasy the subtle omission is significant because the parameters of the debate have dramatically changed			0
dismantling the health care law is a top priority among a core group of conservative lawmakers			1
the demand to defund @entity15 resulted in the government shutdown , despite reluctance from @entity9 leadership to back their plan , knowing that the president and @entity45 @entity164 would never agree to that			2
epilogue : @entity2 's future ultimately , his timely emergence could be part of a larger plot			1
as a young politician with a bright future , speculation is rampant that he might be running for the @entity9 presidential nomination in 2016			0
that speculation grows louder especially as he plans trips to @entity177 and @entity178 , the first presidential nominating states			0
he will keynote a birthday fundraiser for @entity177 's @entity9 governor next month and he is to attend a fundraising breakfast for a congressional candidate in @entity178			0
@entity2 stood back while @entity32 , another potential 2016 hopeful , pushed the @entity9 into a difficult position			1
with some experience on his side having served in @entity40 for 15 years and running on a presidential ticket , @entity2 understands the risk of speaking too often and too soon			0
it creates more opportunity to mess up			0
@entity1 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0

after *keeping* a low - profile , @entity2 emerges with key role in @entity0 's standoff
his op - ed on a path forward first generated a conservative backlash
but his timely emergence has proven effective
leadership effectively transitioned @entity9 negotiation demands away from health care
