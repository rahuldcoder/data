-- you know things in @entity3 are bad when 70 murders in the first quarter can be seen as a good thing			1
but context is everything : last year at this time there had been more than 120 murders , so i guess we should thank @entity13 for small favors			2
it seems inconceivable that the city president @entity17 calls home is also the city where his family may be least safe			0
just this monday a 15 - year - old boy was found shot dead in a backyard only four blocks from the president 's house			0
what 's responsible for the bloodshed ? gang violence , as usual			1
police estimate that of the 532 murders in 2012 -- nearly 1.5 a day -- about 80 percent were gang related			1
and yet , despite that rather staggering statistic , the national outcry is muted at best -- nothing , to say the least , like the kind we saw last week in @entity37			1
what is it about the word " gang " that brings out the apathy in us ? would we view @entity3 differently if we called the perpetrators something else ? in @entity3 , nurses dodge bullets to provide care i 'm not saying the people of @entity37 do not deserve our sympathy ; they do			1
nor am i suggesting the apprehension of @entity37 terror suspect @entity53 was not essential			1
but how do we explain our habit of greeting terrorists with 24 - hour news coverage and relentless wrath while overlooking the gangs that terrorize our streets daily -- as if terrorism were only an enemy state and not a concept			1
the murder numbers may be slightly better in @entity3 , but they do not fully communicate the city 's state of siege			1
in february @entity0 reported that some children living in gang - ridden parts of the city carry guns because , to them , getting caught and serving time for possession of a gun is better than getting caught without one and dying			2
last month , city officials announced the closure of 54 " under - resourced " schools , which will force some kids to walk across warring gang territory to get to school			1
for example , in the seven blocks between @entity82 and @entity83 there are three gangs fighting over territory : @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
kids and guns : ' these are not isolated tragedies ' if it all sounds scary , it 's only because it is			0
and if the name attached to all of this violence were @entity103 instead of @entity89 ; or if instead of " gang violence " the bloodshed were called " terrorism ; " or if instead of calling the people spreading fear and mayhem gangs we were to call them what they really are -- terrorists -- the nation would demand more be done			1
after all , if children are afraid to walk to school because they might get killed or if residents are afraid to identify perpetrators for fear of retaliation , i think it 's safe to say they are being terrorized			2
what seems like a linguistic shell game is really an exercise in empathy			0
the thought of elementary school kids walking across areas of a city controlled by three terrorist groups becomes unacceptable to everyone , not just their parents			2
hearing that 25 @entity126 were shot in one weekend becomes a threat to national security , and not just the mayor 's problem			0
the story of 15 - year - old @entity132 , who was caught in the crossfire of a turf war days after performing during the presidential inauguration , was of interest briefly but her story has since faded			0
she , too , died just a few blocks from the @entity17 's home			0
@entity143 , a 6 - month - old girl , was shot in march while sitting on the lap of her father , @entity146 , the intended target and a gang member			2
opinion : @entity3 's violence took my dad , friends last week , millions watched as an entire city was shut down to look for one guy			1
every major news station was covering the pursuit of one guy			0
we all know the face and relatives of this one guy			0
and it 's all because he is an alleged terrorist			0
but more @entity163 were murdered in the south and west sides of @entity3 than there were @entity163 servicemen killed in @entity168 last year , and yet for some reason we do n't view those neighborhoods as terrorized			1
last week , @entity171 was arrested at @entity172 because the @entity173 believed he was on his way to @entity175 to join a terrorist organization			0
@entity171 reportedly thought he was in contact with a recruiter for a jihadist militant group , but it was actually an @entity173 agent			0
i would love to see the @entity173 's anti-terrorism resources used in that matter to stop would - be gang members from flooding the streets of the country 's third - largest city			2
maybe @entity189 , the boy found dead down the street from @entity17 's house , would still be alive			0
maybe @entity193 , who was playing in a park with her friends , would still be alive			0
maybe @entity143 , who was sitting on her father 's lap , would have had a chance to live			0
their deaths would n't be considered " @entity3 's problem " if authorities suspected terrorists were involved			1
but it 's " gang - related , " so ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : first quarter of 2013 saw 70 murders in @entity3
he asks why are n't gangs treated like terrorists ? they do *damage* like terrorists in @entity37
he says children are unsafe , in terror because they must cross gang territory for school
@entity207 : where is the *urgency* to fight such violence ?
