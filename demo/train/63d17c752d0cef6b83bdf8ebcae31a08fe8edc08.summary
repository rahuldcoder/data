@entity2 is one of the last traditional craftsmen in @entity4 making the oud , the guitar - like instrument heard in so much @entity7 music			1
he is one of only six or seven oud makers still working in the historic @entity9 in @entity10			1
it takes him a week to make one oud for sale , molding it from thin layers of wood that are joined together without using nails			1
" we bring big chunks of wood and then we cut it into thin layers , " said @entity2			2
" first we put those layers on the hot iron			0
when it comes out we glue it together because the @entity28 does n't not have any nails			0
" @entity2 , 62 , inherited his art from his father and started out in his workshop while he was still at school			0
" the profession is originally @entity4 and moved to @entity35 and @entity36 , but my father brought it back to @entity4 , " said @entity2			0

he left his native @entity87 during @entity89 's rule and moved to @entity10 where he now runs a " @entity94 " music school with branches in @entity4 , @entity92 and the @entity93			1
" i think if anybody needs to change the life around him he needs to do something really in education , " said @entity81			1
