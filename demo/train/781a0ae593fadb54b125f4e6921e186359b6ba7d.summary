making @entity1 's resolutions is easy			1
keeping them past january is not			0
why ? because simply resolving to do something is n't enough			0
you need the means to start on the right path and stay the course			1
too many of us set large - scale intentions but fall short on a follow - through strategy			0
that 's where yoga comes in : the ancient practice can provide the resources and support for a multitude of modern - day lifestyle changes			1
if you 've set any of the top resolutions -- like being happier , getting healthier or sleeping better -- yoga offers ways to transform your resolutions into lasting reality			1
and it does n't matter if you 're a seasoned yogi or never stepped onto a mat , you can leverage yoga to realize your most ambitious lifestyle goals			1
here are seven popular resolutions and how you can fulfill them with yoga : 1			1
be happier if you want to be happier , your wandering mind is likely your biggest obstacle			0
according to a 2010 @entity37 study , people spend 47 % of their time thinking about things that are n't happening			0
understandably , spending half your life lost in thought is considered a major cause of unhappiness			0
yoga is a practice based on mindfulness and awareness that emphasizes using your breath to consistently connect to the present moment			1
it also teaches you how to breathe deeper and use meditative techniques to tap into your parasympathetic nervous system to reduce stress and increase happy hormones			0
get healthier whether you 're looking to lower your blood pressure , reduce stress or lose weight , studies abound showing the benefits of yoga for these issues			1
weight loss is probably the most popular resolution made and broken			0
yoga 's overall focus on body awareness and the present moment can help practitioners enhance self control and avoid mindless eating , which are important for long - term success with weight loss			1
and , although yoga is n't the ideal cardiovascular exercise , certain styles , like @entity65 and @entity65 , can increase muscle mass , which burns more calories			2
sleep better yoga is very helpful in facilitating sleep ! i 've created numerous yoga - based sleep programs for my professional athletes and celebrity clients , whose demanding schedules make sleeping difficult			1
using yoga stretches to release tension and enhance blood flow in the abdomen , combined with meditative techniques and diaphragmatic breathing focused on exhaling produces a natural sedative effect in the body			2
make friends if you 're looking to forge friendships , look no further than your local yoga studio ! studios build their businesses around a sense of community			1
most hold events in and out of the studio -- from book clubs to cocktail parties -- to foster relationships among students			0
@entity109 , co-owner of @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 , says , " yoga tends to attract like - minded people , so relationships blossom easily while chatting after class or at special events			2
volunteer more @entity117 is an admirable resolution but it can be surprisingly daunting to find the right organization to donate your time			0
let your yoga studio take the guesswork out of volunteering and make getting involved an easier process			1
most yoga studios are affiliated with a charity , and often donate time to schools , prisons or shelters			2
for example , @entity109 says her studio recently helped start a facility for homeless and struggling veterans			0
travel if traveling more is one of your goals , yoga can provide the impetus			1
yoga retreats take place all over the world , ranging from weekend workshops to month - long immersions			2
whether you 're into modest camping trips or five - star luxury hotels in exotic locations , you can find a retreat that 's perfect for you			2
check out www.bookyogaretreats.com , which claims to be " the world 's largest yoga travel site			1
learn something new maybe the practice of yoga is new to you			2
if that 's the case , there 's your resolution ! but if you 've been practicing a while , there are opportunities to expand your knowledge into related subjects			2
you can explore energy chakras , learn new forms of meditation or even become a yoga teacher			0
a quick online search will reveal boundless books , courses and certification programs on any yoga - related topic that interests you			0
and , chances are a studio near you will have a related workshop on their schedule			0
" every january , our studio holds workshops on the yoga philosophy of the @entity184 and @entity185 , " says @entity109			0
" being kind , truthful and balanced in life may not be new thoughts , but the reminder of these qualities as the backdrop of a yoga practice can inspire new resolutions			1
" regardless of your resolution , if you need inspiration and support to get over the january hump and achieve lasting change , try spending some time on your yoga mat.			0

yoga is a useful tool to help keep @entity1 's resolutions
it can offer a way to stay in shape , make new friends , sleep better and travel more
