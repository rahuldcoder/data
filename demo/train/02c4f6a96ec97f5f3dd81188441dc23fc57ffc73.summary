there are many other factors making me feel this way : relationships with other people , my relationship with language , my relationship with the world			0
love sometimes makes you feel you are in exile			0
existentially , the feeling of permanence is always accompanied by a feeling of exile , of impermanence			0
@entity1 : how has @entity3 changed since you left ? a : what 's strange is i feel it is i who has changed , not the country			1
