-- so a bunch of guys away from home , who should know better , take off their wedding rings , mix testosterone with alcohol and hookers --- an appalling combination --- argue over the price of a lady 's company and , all of a sudden , the entire culture of the @entity2 is thrown into question			1
all of a sudden , this is the worst disaster for the @entity2 , ever			1
all of a sudden , the @entity2 is out of control			1
all of a sudden , anything might have happened , like one of the 11 agents could have been blackmailed to open a door for a sniper or to look the other way as a bomb - carrying terrorist walks up to the president			1
all of a sudden , the men and women of the @entity2 are no longer the best and the brightest			1
all of a sudden ... stop ! it 's time for a reality check			1
the 11 agents who were sent home from @entity33 in disgrace before the president even left @entity36 were there in a support role			1
whether they were manning metal detectors or handling dogs that sweep rooms , whether they were part of a sniper team or standing post at 3 a.m. along a barricaded street , they were not members of the @entity46 ( @entity46 )			0
they were not on the president 's shoulder			2
at no time was the president 's security in danger			1
what damage did their stupidity do ? obviously , a lot to their personal lives , their marriages and their careers			0
obviously , also , a lot to the image and reputation of the @entity2			1
the legislation creating the @entity2 was sitting on @entity67 's desk , waiting to be signed , on april 15 , 1865 , the night he was assassinated			1
in those days , the @entity2 was housed inside the @entity69 , and its job was to protect and defend the currency and monetary instruments of the @entity73			1
it did n't get the supplementary duty of protecting the president and vice president until after @entity77 was assassinated in 1901			2
no agent i have ever met was hired for his sense of humor			0
these are very serious men and women who do their jobs very seriously			0
they have always been the best and the brightest			0
you can see it in the way they stand a little taller and walk with a different gait than others in law enforcement			0
you can see it in their pride			0
frankly , i ca n't think of any other law enforcement agency where pride counts as much as it does with the @entity2			1
it 's the same pride that is always so visible with the @entity101			0
that 's the reason why this scandal matters			2
not because someone thinks the agency is out of control			0
not because of wildly exaggerated threats of blackmail			0
no , @entity110 , the sky is not falling			0
it matters because the idiotic actions of 11 agents who forgot who they are and what their badge stands for deeply affects every active duty agent and tens of thousands of retired agents			1
and agents are , rightly , furious			2
these are men and women who have made -- and continue to make -- huge personal sacrifices for their share in that pride			1
the divorce rate among agents is high			0
that 's not because they party with hookers , but because for the privilege of wearing that special five starred badge , they abandon any thoughts of their time being their own			0
they miss birthdays and @entity137 , @entity139 games , graduations , school plays , first teeth , first steps , first words			0
when the president travels , especially overseas , it 's a flying circus with 800 - 1,000 people , limousines , helicopters , communications equipment , big guns , small guns , sometimes food , and often 20 - 30 planes			1
as an integral part of this , secret service agents have two main concerns : to create and to maintain a tightly controlled environment in which the president can do his job safely and to bring everyone home at night			1
anything short of that is , the way the @entity2 defines the word , failure			2
just as those two things are true , so are these : what happened with those 11 agents is defined as stupidity			2
they will be dealt with quickly by the @entity2			2
the president 's opponents will pretend that there are political ramifications and invent whatever capital out of this that they can to embarrass the president			0
it will take a long time before pride is fully restored , and , if this ever happens again , it will definitely not be soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : bad *behavior* of 11 @entity2 agents has caused *uproar* over whole force
time for a reality check , he says ; president was not in danger
he says most agents proud , serious , willing to make big sacrifices for job
@entity185 : agents in scandal were stupid ; now people playing politics
