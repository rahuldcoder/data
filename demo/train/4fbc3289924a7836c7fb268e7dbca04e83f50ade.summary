@entity1 prime minister @entity0 called for unity as he appeared headed for a third term as president , declaring victory in an " open and honest fight " in sunday 's election			1
but chess champion - turned - opposition activist @entity8 accused @entity0 's supporters of " massive fraud " early monday by packing the polls with additional voters			1
with better than two - thirds of the vote reporting early monday , @entity0 led his closest rival by a nearly 4 - to - 1 margin			1
his margin of victory was smaller than in 2004 , the last time he ran for president , but appears well above the 50 % needed to avoid a runoff			1
" we have won an open and honest fight , " @entity0 told the cheering and flag - waving supporters who had braved the cold in @entity26 for hours to hear his expected victory speech			1
the results show " that our people are ready for renewal , and have only one aim			2
" " we are appealing to all people to unite for our people , for our motherland , and we will win , " he said			0
" we 've had a victory ! glory to @entity1 ! " the 59 - year - old former @entity37 officer served two terms in the @entity39 before term limits forced him to step down in 2008			2
but he served as prime minister under his successor , @entity42 , and continued to dominate @entity1 politics			0
with more than 68 % of boxes reporting , @entity0 had just under 65 % of the vote in a field of five candidates			1
his closest challenger , @entity48 leader @entity48 , had slightly more than had 17 % ; the other three candidates -- including billionaire @entity50 , the owner of the @entity52 basketball team -- were running in the single digits			2
critics have long accused @entity0 of undermining @entity1 's democratic institutions during his years in power , and accusations of voter fraud in december 's parliamentary elections have led to unprecedented public protests against his government			1
but @entity62 , a media analyst at @entity63 , told @entity64 the demonstrations may have helped @entity0 consolidate his support			1
" he was able to mobilize his core electorate -- the workers , the blue - collar workers , the state workers -- all the people that the state pays salaries to , all the people that the state gives order to , like industrial complexes , " @entity62 said			0
" i think they all have been shaken and stirred by the fact that the opposition has so many people , that they are so vocal , and i think this has pulled them into action			0
" but opposition figures said they planned to continue their demonstrations as early as monday , fueled by new complaints about sunday 's results			2
@entity8 , who served as a poll watcher in his @entity91 neighborhood , said @entity0 's supporters " simply added new voters to the register using so - called supplementary voter rolls			1
" " at one of the polling stations , the number of extra voters even exceeded the number of registered voters , " he said			2
and @entity102 , a member of parliament and a prominent protest figure , said he did not feel there was a fair counting of votes			0
many polls before the vote , he said , showed @entity0 receiving around 40 %			1
" mr. @entity0 remains to be one of the most popular politicians in the country , probably the most popular politician in the country , and it 's quite natural that he 's receiving the majority of the votes , " @entity102 , of the @entity110 party , told @entity64 from @entity91 's @entity111			1
" but it should not be an overwhelming majority , and i think there has to be a runoff			0
" but in the run - up to sunday 's voting , @entity0 's spokesman played down the public protests over the past three months			2
" it 's pure mathematics , " @entity127 said			0
" yes , we have something like 70,000 people out there ( protesting ) on @entity134 , but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority			0
the majority of the population does not live here in @entity91			0
we have a huge country and if we look eastwards , we 'll see lots and lots of big cities , small towns and rural populations that still support @entity0 pretty well			2
" three policemen were killed in an attack on a polling station in @entity1 's southern republic of @entity153 after voting closed sunday , police spokesman @entity147 said			1
one of the attackers , who all wore masks , was also killed , he said			0
violence has plagued the republic for years , with @entity160 rebels fighting @entity91 rule in the region , and @entity147 said the @entity163 would vigorously investigate the attack			0
of @entity0 's opponents , @entity50 -- @entity1 's third - richest man -- was the only fresh face in the pack			1
@entity48 is a serial election loser now facing his fourth defeat , while right - wing candidate @entity170 and left - leaning @entity171 also have run and lost previous campaigns			0
on paper , @entity50 's manifesto of democratic and economic reforms should have appealed to many of @entity91 's voters , but he struggled to shake a reputation of being too close to the regime			0
cynics call him a @entity39 project , a candidate designed to credibly attract the middle - class vote without posing a genuine threat .			0
