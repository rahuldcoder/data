@entity0 refused to share the debt burden of stressed eurozone peers on tuesday , ignoring two of the most influential international economic bodies which offered support for proposals championed by @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 ahead of a summit			1
@entity11 , @entity0 's chancellor , has argued that any co-mingling of eurozone debt would remove incentives for southern economies to adopt structural reforms			1
the calls from the @entity18 and the @entity19 came on the eve of wednesday 's @entity22 summit			1
@entity23 , @entity24 's new president , has strongly backed common eurozone bonds -- which would ease funding constraints for the eurozone 's stressed periphery but potentially raise @entity0 borrowing costs by diluting its creditworthiness across the currency union			1
@entity0 officials made clear the idea was a non-starter in @entity36			2
" there is no way of introducing them under the current [ @entity22 ] treaties			0
indeed , there is an explicit ban on them , " one senior @entity0 official said , adding @entity36 would not drop its opposition in the foreseeable future			2
" that 's a firm conviction which will not change in june			0
" increased jitters over how @entity50 's banking system would be affected by an exit of @entity52 from the eurozone have lent urgency to the latest discussions over measures to tackle the sovereign debt crisis			2
@entity19 : @entity59 crisis could derail recovery mr @entity23 has vowed to raise eurozone bonds at the informal summit			1
he won backing from the @entity19 , which in its twice - yearly economic outlook specifically called for such bonds , saying they were needed to break a vicious circle " involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness , weak banking systems , excessive fiscal consolidation and lower growth			1
" " we need to get on the path towards the issuance of euro bonds sooner rather than later , " @entity71 , the @entity19 chief economist , told the @entity72			1
@entity77 , the @entity18 chief , also called for more burden - sharing			1
though she stopped short of explicitly backing euro bonds , she said " more needs to be done , particularly by way of fiscal liability sharing " -- a thinly veiled reference to such debt instruments			2
diplomats said the summit , which just last week looked like it would be a highly scripted affair on @entity50 growth , had become increasingly unpredictable , with leaders struggling with how to respond to the havoc wreaked by political instability in @entity52			0
officials emphasised that no formal decisions would be taken			0
the euro bonds debate could produce fireworks between mr @entity23 and ms @entity11 -- a possibility that has captivated officials involved , given the comparatively harmonious @entity97 - @entity0 relationship in the latter years of @entity99 's tenure			1
but most diplomats believe ms @entity11 would succeed in blocking any proposal , producing more smoke than fire			0
" they say that when @entity0 and @entity24 do n't co-operate , we have a problem , " one senior diplomat from a smaller @entity22 country said			2
" and when they do , we have a problem , too			0
" of more urgent concern are ongoing discussions over eurozone banks , with officials saying the fear of a @entity52 eurozone exit has forced leaders to contemplate massive rescues , particularly in @entity118			0
rising estimates of bad loans have forced @entity121 to part - nationalise one bank and face the increasing likelihood it will need to inject more government money into others			0
senior @entity22 officials question whether @entity121 , which has faced rising bond market borrowing costs , has the financial wherewithal on its own , spurring a furious series of negotiations over whether the eurozone needs to move quickly towards a common bailout and deposit guarantee scheme			0
although officials said such reforms have pushed themselves onto tonight 's agenda , it remains unlikely any can be agreed quickly , making the @entity140 the last line of defence if @entity52 forces more immediate action .			0
