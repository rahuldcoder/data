officials from @entity2 , @entity3 and separatist groups engaged in low - level talks hours before a crucial meeting over the crisis in eastern @entity3			1
in the early morning hours wednesday , the parties gathered in @entity9 with one question answered in part : will separatist leaders whose pro-russian forces are battling with @entity3 soldiers for control of eastern @entity3 show up ? @entity16 showed @entity17 of the self - proclaimed @entity18 and @entity19 of the @entity20 at the talks speaking with reporters			1
monitors from the @entity24 also attended the preliminary meeting			0
if a peace deal is to be reached , leaders involved in the talks still have a long road before a lasting agreement is reached , @entity1 's @entity26 reported from @entity32			2
later in the day , the leaders of @entity34 and @entity35 hope to bring together @entity2 president @entity36 and his @entity3 counterpart , @entity37 , on wednesday in the capital of @entity9			1
@entity41 president @entity40 called @entity36 on tuesday and urged him to seize the opportunity for peace , the @entity39 said			1
" the president emphasized the importance of reaching and implementing a negotiated settlement underpinned by the commitments in the ( prior ) @entity32 agreement			0
however , if @entity2 continues its aggressive actions in @entity3 , including by sending troops , weapons and financing to support the separatists , the costs for @entity2 will rise , " the @entity39 said			1
@entity35 chancellor @entity55 said monday that @entity57 diplomats were making " one further effort " at negotiating a deal to resolve the crisis			0
in an interview with @entity2 's state - run @entity65 news agency , @entity62 spokesman @entity61 said @entity2 was " really interested in a peaceful settlement of the crisis in @entity3			1
" he said other @entity69 proposals , such as imposing more sanctions against @entity2 interests , isolating @entity2 or the possible arming of @entity3 forces , would only destabilize the situation			1
the @entity76 's @entity75 agreed on additional sanctions monday against @entity2 and separatist interests but said their implementation would be delayed for a week to " give space for current diplomatic efforts			2
" meanwhile , fighting continued in eastern @entity3 's @entity83 and @entity84 regions , with the strategically important town of @entity86 under fire and deadly shelling reported in the town of @entity90			1
what 's next in conflict ? a spokesman for the government 's military operation against the separatists , @entity97 , told a media briefing that the militants were consistently shelling @entity86 -- and that it 's currently the most dangerous place in the country			0
" the city infrastructure is increasingly devastated , " he said			0
" @entity3 armed forces are holding their lines of defense and are not going to leave their positions			2
" seven @entity3 soldiers were killed and 23 injured overnight , he said			2
@entity108 , deputy defense minister of the self - declared @entity18 , said fighting for the town continued			0
a day earlier , @entity108 said the separatist forces had @entity86 " entirely surrounded			0
" about 55 miles ( 89 kilometers ) to the northwest , shelling in @entity90 killed 12 civilians and injured 35 , including at least five children , the @entity112 - backed @entity83 regional authority said			1
@entity90 , deep inside @entity3 - held territory , is the location of the main base for the government 's military operation against the separatists , which it calls the anti-terrorist operation , or @entity123			1
thirty - two @entity3 military personnel were injured in shelling on the base 's airfield , according to @entity83 regional health care authorities			1
the official @entity129 page for the @entity123 said cluster bombs were used to shell the airfield at lunchtime			0
@entity123 spokesman @entity133 said that these munitions are not used by @entity3 's military			2
each side has accused the other of shelling civilian areas in the course of the conflict			0
the @entity24 's monitoring mission in @entity3 last week reported evidence of the use of cluster munitions in separatist - controlled @entity84 city			2
cluster bombs are banned by many states because of their deadly impact on civilians			0
the main points of negotiations of the so - called @entity160 -- the leaders of @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity2 and @entity3 -- would be the withdrawal of heavy weapons , the creation of a demilitarized zone and the beginning of a permanent dialogue between @entity112 and the @entity157 area , which comprises @entity84 and @entity83 , @entity151 quoted a diplomatic source at the talks as saying			1
the big challenge facing @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity55 and @entity34 president @entity167 in @entity32 is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick			2
a peace agreement was signed in september in @entity32			0
it called for a drawback of heavy weapons , self rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the @entity2 - @entity3 border			1
but the agreement quickly disintegrated , and the violence continued			0
the new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines			0
@entity2 has steadfastly denied accusations that it is sending forces and weapons into @entity3			2
but top @entity69 and @entity3 leaders have said there is n't any doubt that @entity2 is behind surging violence and separatists ' efforts to take over territory in eastern @entity3			1
@entity55 in the middle of a @entity41 - @entity2 standoff as the time for crunch talks to begin approached , questions remain over apparent differences between @entity57 leaders and the @entity41 about whether to arm the @entity3 government forces			1
even as they tried to present a unified front at a media briefing monday , it was clear that it 's an area where @entity40 and @entity55 do n't quite see eye to eye			0
@entity40 said he has n't decided yet whether to send arms to @entity3 forces defending their country against @entity2 - backed separatists , and he has n't set a deadline for when he will			1
but he insists it 's an option that should be considered if diplomacy fails			0
any weapons the @entity41 sends would not be meant to help @entity3 defeat the @entity2 army in an all - out battle , @entity40 said , but " simply to defend itself			1
" @entity55 favors a different approach			0
" i 've always said i do n't see a military solution to this conflict , " she said			0
" we have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution			0
" both @entity40 and @entity55 stressed the importance of working together			0
if the @entity32 talks fail , @entity41 lawmakers will probably ratchet up pressure on @entity40 to send weapons to @entity3			1
all the while , the crisis in @entity3 , which stemmed from a trade agreement , has killed more than 5,000 people , including many civilians , and forced more than 1.5 million from their homes , according to the @entity232			2
@entity1 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and journalist @entity241 in @entity112 , @entity3 , contributed to this report .			2
