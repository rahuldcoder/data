@entity0 -- there 's both poetry and promise in the humble balloon			0
it delivered escape and adventure in @entity10 's " @entity9 , " friendship to a small boy in the classic short film " @entity13 , " and -- delving into real - world history now -- military messages for @entity17 strategist @entity16 back in 220 ad			2
now @entity18 plans to use a network of high - flying balloons to deliver low - cost internet access to remote and under - served places around the world			1
it 's called @entity25 , the latest initiative from the tech giant 's innovation lab , @entity18 [ x ]			1
@entity25 uses a fleet of super-pressure balloons made out of very thin polyethylene plastic			1
measuring 15 meters across when fully inflated , each balloon carries a payload of electronics including a flight computer , altitude control system , communications antenna and a solar power station -- turning the craft into a self - powering cell tower in the sky			2
" we want to keep them up there , floating around for eventually up to 100 days , " @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 team member said on @entity1 's @entity47			0
" that way we can have a ring of balloons we hope can provide internet access to a whole range of places that are really difficult to get to with normal technology			1
" the @entity25 balloons are strategically positioned on stratospheric winds and controlled by complex algorithms and computing power on the ground			1
@entity18 said a team of six people is required to launch a @entity25 balloon , including a launch commander and a coordination team at @entity67			1
the need for the connectivity that @entity25 promises is immense			2
believe it or not , in this networked age , some five billion people are not connected to the @entity73 , according to @entity18			2
to put it in another way , two - thirds of humanity are being denied online connectivity and the economic promise that comes with it			0
@entity25 can also play a critical role during a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis			1
" during a crisis , connectivity is really important because information in itself is really lifesaving , " said @entity43			0
" anything that can ( provide connectivity ) for remote areas at a low cost much cheaper than satellites is something we 're really going to celebrate and we 're hopeful can make a real difference			1
" last month , the team conducted a successful pilot test in @entity96 , launching 30 balloons over two weeks to test basic launch procedures , internet connection to the ground , and descent and recovery of the balloons			2
a group of 50 pilot testers in @entity106 and parts of @entity108 on @entity96 's @entity109 were equipped with special internet antennas to connect to the @entity25 balloons , including @entity112 -- the first person in the world to connect to @entity18 's balloon - powered @entity73			1
" the way i became involved in the trial was by a third - party research organization , " @entity112 told me via email			0
" they phoned one night and sounded completely suspect to the point where i was about to hang up			0
" eventually @entity112 signed a nondisclosure agreement and a group of technicians arrived at his door to attach what looked like a red ball to the side of his house			0
" i thought , ' finally , some people who can tell me what is going on			0
' their reply was , ' we do n't actually know either			0
' the whole process was cryptic and was making a dull week rather exciting to be honest			0
" in a rural area with historically unreliable internet access , @entity112 said he now enjoys the benefits of constant connectivity like a social media presence , an ability to better market his products online , and a stable platform for his children to complete their homework online			2
@entity112 is happy with his balloon - powered net connection			0
and , as the world 's first person to make a connection in such a way , he also recognizes the heights @entity18 must scale to make @entity25 a viable solution			1
" it is a system that will need to reach a critical scale in order to be effective world - wide and will need some degree of cooperation between governments , " he said			1
" the scale and complexity of the idea is mind - boggling but it seems plausible , and @entity18 is probably the only company with the resources to pull it off			1
" onward ... and upward .			0

@entity18 plans to use a network of high - flying balloons to deliver low - cost internet
@entity25 will give access to remote and under served places around world
loon balloons strategically positioned on stratospheric winds , controlled by algorithms
@entity18 : project can play critical role during a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis
