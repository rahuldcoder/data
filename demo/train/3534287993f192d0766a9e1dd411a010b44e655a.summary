there 's a " camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to @entity123			0
they are the @entity57 , at the head of which is @entity127 , " @entity114 said			0
" in the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man			0

" " i believe this @entity57 will spread , rapidly , and i believe it will be in @entity137 and even @entity70 within decades , " @entity114 said			0
