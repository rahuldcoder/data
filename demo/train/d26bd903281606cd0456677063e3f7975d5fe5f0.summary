they came by the thousands -- in @entity3 and in @entity4 -- to cry , to honor and never to forget			1
mourners on tuesday remembered beloved sons and daughters who became terrorist targets in three attacks last week in @entity3			1
they died at the hands of three @entity12 extremists who tried to use religion to justify their slaughter			2
" he was killed by false @entity16 , " said @entity15 , whose brother @entity16 -- also a @entity16 -- was one of three @entity3 police officers killed in the attacks			1
" one must not confuse extremists with @entity16			2
mad people have neither color nor religion			2
" @entity3 authorities on friday killed the three people directly behind the wave of terror			1
it began two days earlier with the massacre of 12 at the offices of the satirical @entity32 magazine ; continued thursday with police officer @entity34 's slaying in the @entity36 suburb of @entity37 ; and climaxed the next day with a hostage siege at a kosher grocery store that killed four			2
since then , many around the globe have joined @entity3 in rallying against the @entity12 terror threat			1
that spirit was evident sunday in @entity36 when world leaders joined an estimated 1.5 million people marching in defiance of the killers and in solidarity with one another			2
but if sunday was a day for unity , tuesday was a day to grieve			0
that 's what happened in @entity53 , where @entity4 leaders joined thousands to remember the four victims of the eastern @entity36 grocery store siege and to support their loved ones as they were buried			1

@entity15 was buried later tuesday , while the other two will be laid to rest in the coming days			0
" they shared one desire : that of protecting their citizens , " @entity67 said			0
" they had one ideal : that of serving the republic			0
they died in accomplishing their mission with courage , with bravery , with dignity			0
" they died as police officers			0
" at tuesday 's ceremony , @entity67 spoke about the three officers individually as well as their shared profession and values			2
@entity71 was a protection officer for @entity32 's editor , @entity96 , who was also killed wednesday			2
" he had become one of those policemen especially trained to ensure the safety , the security of people who are particularly vulnerable , " @entity67 said			0
and @entity34 was responding to a traffic accident when she was killed by a gunman suspected in last week 's terror attacks			1
" she was cowardly shot in the back , " @entity67 said			0
" how can one justify that one can kill so cowardly a young woman of 26 years of age , with all the future before her devoted to others ? " @entity67 spoke of the " wonderful future " @entity15 had ahead of him before his horrific death , which was caught on video -- with a gunman walking right up to him as he lay sprawled on the ground , then opening fire			0
@entity15 was laid to rest at the @entity118 @entity117 cemetery in a @entity36 suburb after a brief ceremony			0
mourners applauded other police officers on hand and watched as @entity15 's coffin -- draped in a @entity3 flag -- was carried to the grave site			1
one target of the terrorists -- @entity32 , the magazine -- will live on			0
" there is a future , " said @entity129 , the magazine 's editor - in - chief , " but we do n't know yet what it will resemble			2
( but ) there will be no interruption			0
in two weeks ' time , there will be another edition of @entity32			0
" the publication -- known for its provocative jabs at religion , politics , society and more -- went to the presses tuesday for the first time since the attack			0
three million copies will be printed , up from the usual 60,000 , in several languages , including @entity150			0
the issue will hit newsstands wednesday			0
this time , the cover features a drawing of a frowning @entity154 with a teardrop coming from his eye			0
" all is forgiven , " the cover headline says in @entity3			1
@entity32 puts @entity154 on its new cover in the prophet 's hands , a sign says , " @entity164 " -- or " i am @entity164 , " the phrase adopted around the world in protest of the attacks			1
the @entity170 - based @entity169 condemned such depictions of @entity154 as offensive to " millions of @entity16 around the world			0
" yet cartoonist @entity174 told reporters tuesday that the new edition 's cover felt appropriate to him , adding that he cried after finishing it			2
" i 'm sorry that i 've drawn him again , but the @entity154 that we 've drawn " is , above all , a @entity154 who is crying , said @entity174 , who goes by the pen name @entity180			0
muslims worldwide have condemned last week 's attacks on @entity32 and elsewhere in @entity3			1
but @entity187 , the terror group 's @entity188 branch , is threatening more of them , according to a warning posted on jihadist websites			1

many former @entity3 colonies are in that area , with @entity36 often coming to their support to fight against @entity12 militants			1
more than 6,000 forces are involved in operations in and around @entity188 , according to @entity201 spokesman @entity200			2
" @entity3 pays the cost of its violence on @entity16 countries and the violation of their sanctity , " the terror group said in a statement			1
" as long as its soldiers occupy countries such as @entity212 and @entity213 and bombard our people in @entity216 and @entity217 , and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our @entity154 ( @entity154 ) , @entity3 will expose itself to the worst and more			1
" @entity3 's @entity219 voted later tuesday to extend airstrikes against @entity221 in @entity217			1
but before doing so , assembly members stood tall together , proudly singing @entity3 's national anthem , " @entity224			1
" among its lyrics , these timely words : " @entity229 , cherished liberty , fight alongside your defenders			0
" that fight is happening inside @entity3 , where , @entity200 says , there will be more than 10,000 @entity3 troops deployed by wednesday			1
and outside @entity3 , the battle against @entity221 and @entity187 is in full force in parts of the @entity237 and beyond			1
then there 's the ongoing investigation and intelligence work , aimed at preventing future attacks and learning more about the latest one			1
