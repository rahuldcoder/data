@entity1 safaris have upped their game			0
we 're not talking about the " @entity12 " beasts -- lion , leopard , elephant , rhino , buffalo -- that people pay top dollar to see			0
we 're talking about the accommodations			0
for those with budgets as grand as the sweeping plains of southern and eastern @entity18 , exploring the wilderness need n't come at the expense of luxury			1
@entity22 ( @entity23 , @entity24 ) @entity23 is the only permanent lodge within @entity23 -- it comprises 10 stilted tree house suites in the boughs of ancient mahogany trees			0
the words " tree house " might be misleading -- there 's not a splintered plank in sight			1
instead , there are free - standing bath tubs ( complete with a nightly sprinkling of rose petals ) and enormous bathrooms with twin sinks and split - level living areas			0
after dusty safaris , guests are welcomed back with gin and tonics and cold , scented towels			1
@entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 ; +27 11 809 4300 ; from $ 555 per person per night @entity46 ( @entity47 , @entity48 ) as revealed by the date in its name , @entity49 harks back to a " golden age " of safari by kitting out staff in vintage livery and furnishing quarters with antiques			1
on the outskirts of the @entity47 , the camp has 10 tents in total -- five doubles , four family - sized and one for honeymooners			0
the latter have fireplaces and separate living rooms			0
guests can eat in the well appointed communal dining area or opt for a candlelit meal within the privacy of their own tent			1
@entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; +254 7337 73377 ; from $ 520 per person per night @entity74 ( @entity75 , @entity48 ) the 12 suites at @entity78 's safari camp are tents in name only			1
the units all have enormous canopied verandas replete with roll - top bath tub and infinity pool			0
after a day of lion spotting , guests retreat to the @entity88 spa tent where the signature treatment is a " healing journey " involving rose quartz and amethyst			2
dinner is served in a communal area but staff can arrange champagne barbecues in the bush			1
@entity74 , @entity75 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; +44 208 600 0430 ; from $ 800 per room per night @entity99 ( @entity100 , @entity18 ) @entity101 makes no pretense of being under canvas , housing its 16 luxurious rooms and suites within a main lodge or individual cottages			1
although the @entity109 is n't a @entity12 reserve , it does contain bushman 's rock paintings and is home to the endangered @entity114			2
those staying in the main lodge get their own private chef and ranger along with a private pool and library			0

@entity126 , @entity100 , @entity18 ; +27 27 482 8200 ; from $ 230 per person per night @entity128 ( @entity129 , @entity18 ) @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity133 billionaire @entity132 have all stayed at this luxurious safari camp , where highlights include private infinity pools , enormous , window - side baths and personal butlers , rangers and trackers			1
even the safari guides are classy -- one of them is @entity144 , one of only two " master trackers " ( the highest rank a wildlife tracker can achieve ) working in southern @entity18			1
@entity148 , @entity129 , @entity18 ; +27 15 793 0150 ; from $ 1,197 per person per night @entity150 ( @entity151 , @entity18 ) there are no mini-bars at the @entity150 , only maxi - bars rammed with cured meats , chocolate , nougat and fruit			1
there are six plush villas in total -- all come with private infinity pools and spacious decking areas rigged out with telescopes			0
this area of @entity129 is unaffected by migration so the wildlife viewing is consistently good , and is especially popular with bird watchers			0
@entity150 , @entity151 , @entity18 ; +27 13 735 5000 ; from $ 503 per person per night @entity171 ( @entity172 , @entity173 ) a safari camp by the company that operates the @entity176 is never going to be too shabby			1
@entity171 offers enormous private viewing platforms , complimentary @entity179 binoculars , and an intercom system to summon room service			0
the private suite features an infinity pool in which guests can wallow while watching hippos on the riverbank overlooking the pool doing the same			2

guests do n't just get their very own enormous tent , complete with fireplace and mini-bar , they get their own ranger , guide and @entity201			2
this means itineraries are totally flexible			0
the camp can accommodate a maximum of just 30 people who eat in the communal dining area or on their tent 's private deck , with just a telescope and bottle of vintage wine for distractions			1
@entity214 , @entity215 , @entity48 ; +27 53 781 9331 ; from $ 933 per person per night @entity217 ( @entity218 , @entity219 ) going on safari could seem like a nuisance for anyone ensconced in the luxury at @entity217			1
the camp 's six villas , which opened earlier this year , all have private dining areas , lounges , libraries and tree - shaded pools with viewing decks			2
there 's also a large yoga area and a spa			2
for those who do tear themselves away to spot some animals , the camp is surrounded by 60 acres of private land , and its position on the banks of the @entity242 means there 's no shortage of wildlife			2
guests also get direct access into one of the most game - rich areas of the @entity218			2
@entity251 , @entity218 , @entity219 , +44 1980 849160 ; from $ 254 per person per night @entity253 @entity254 ( @entity255 , @entity24 ) for those that want safari and the comfort of a hotel , there 's the @entity253 @entity254			1
