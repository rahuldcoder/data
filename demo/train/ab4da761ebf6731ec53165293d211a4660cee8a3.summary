-- @entity1 broadcast on thursday an audiotape on which a voice identified as @entity4 declares " @entity5 is the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate @entity8			1
" terrorist leader @entity4 spoke on a video released by @entity10 in september			1
the voice calls on " muslims in neighboring countries " to " do their best in supporting their mujahedeen brothers in @entity5			1
" " my speech to you is about the siege of @entity20 and the way to liberate it , " he said			1
" the @entity20 siege is a direct result of @entity25 , " he adds , apparently referring to the site of november 's summit in @entity25 , @entity26 , where @entity28 and @entity29 leadership agreed to work toward a two - state plan			1
he accused arabs who supported the plan of having become " partners in this horrendous crime			0
" and he predicted , " @entity8 will be restored to us , with @entity39 's permission , when we wake up from our slumber and adhere to our faith and sacrifice our souls and belongings for it			1
" the speaker called for armed revolt in the @entity47			2
" @entity8 and its people have been suffering from too much bitterness for almost a century now on the hands of the @entity51 and the @entity52			1
and both parties did n't take @entity8 from us by negotiations and dialogue , but with arms and fire , and this is the only way to take it back , " he said			1
though the voice sounds like @entity4 , @entity0 has not been able to confirm that it is him			1
however , a radical @entity63 web site reported earlier wednesday that a statement from @entity4 was coming soon			1
the notice appeared on @entity66 , known for carrying statements and videos from @entity10 and its allies			0
analysis of previous statements has indicated that @entity4 was the speaker , and a @entity73 intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not @entity4 's			1
the broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the @entity10 leader condemned @entity81 countries for siding with the @entity73 in @entity82 and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to @entity86 's prophet , @entity85			0
" this is the greater and more serious tragedy , and the reckoning for it will be more severe , " the speaker in the five - minute audio recording says			2
the speaker said @entity11 have not responded by mocking @entity92 , whom they consider a prophet as well			2
" the laws of men which clash with the legislation of @entity97 the @entity98 are null and void , are n't sacred and do n't matter to us , " he said			0
the speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement , citing @entity81 countries ' laws against denying the existence of the @entity107			1
@entity4 also said in his earlier message that " the crownless king in @entity110 " -- @entity112 's @entity111 -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons " if it mattered to him			1
" " if there is no check on the freedom of your words , then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions , " he said			0
@entity4 , who was behind the terrorist network 's september 11 attacks , has been in hiding since the @entity73 assault on @entity82 that followed those strikes			2
his last public statement was an audio message issued in december , when he urged his followers in @entity5 to continue battling @entity73 troops there			2
wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the @entity73 - led invasion of @entity5			2
the latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy , which began in late 2005 when a @entity137 newspaper published a dozen cartoons about @entity86 , including one that depicted @entity85 wearing a turban resembling a bomb			0
violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other @entity81 newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech			0
some @entity11 believe it is forbidden by the @entity149 to show an image of the prophet at all , and others were offended that the cartoon by artist @entity154 appeared to depict @entity85 as a terrorist			0
@entity154 said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror			0
several newspapers in @entity137 reprinted the controversial cartoons in february after @entity137 authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a " terror - related assassination " of the cartoonist			0
that sparked violent protests in three @entity82 cities this month , with @entity11 students burning flags and chanting anti-western statements			0
the message said the publication of the drawings in question " came in the framework of a new crusade in which the @entity174 of the @entity175 has played a large , lengthy role			0
" pope @entity180 is scheduled to visit the @entity73 next month , with scheduled stops at the @entity182 , the @entity183 and @entity184 , where the @entity185 stood until @entity10 's attack			0
deputy commissioner @entity187 of the @entity188 said the department " has been working closely with the @entity189 to provide the highest level of protection possible " during the @entity174 's visit to @entity193			0
e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			2
