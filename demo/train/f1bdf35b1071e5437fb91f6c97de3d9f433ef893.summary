@entity0 -- latin goodbyes sometimes lack the finality of @entity5 ones			0
in @entity7 , for instance , the expression " arrivederci " does n't mean a definite adieu but rather " until we meet again			2
" yet even in @entity7 there are occasions when people want their farewells to be lasting , as the country 's ultimate comeback king may finally have to concede			1
after being convicted for tax fraud and facing more legal woes for cavorting with an underage call girl , @entity18 will likely be banned from public office soon			0
a desperate attempt by the three - time prime minister to thwart a vote on his exclusion backfired in spectacular fashion , when even his anointed heir refused to follow orders and torpedo the government			0
the message to @entity18 this time was not just " goodbye , " but " good riddance			1
" still , as lifelong opponents prepare to raise a glass to a fresh era , one ca n't help but wonder what this new @entity7 will look like without its familiar @entity18 sideshow			1
read more : @entity41 says @entity18 will not be part of @entity7 parliament again if the 77 - year - old 's antics were a welcome distraction from the country 's slide down the world league tables , then what vision -- if any -- will this disparate bunch of successors have ? since rising to prominence during the power vacuum that followed @entity7 's corruption scandals in the 1990s , @entity18 has dominated the political and business arena for more than two decades			1
his detractors will say he has done countless damage to their nation 's reputation and taken a wrecking ball to its economy -- leaving generations to come with a hefty price to pay			0
read more : the end for ' @entity18 ' ? furthermore , @entity18 has undermined the rule of law by pursuing a personal vendetta against the judiciary and used parliament to pass bills that protected his interests			0
but for all his pantomime charades at home and abroad , one has to acknowledge the ex-premier has earned some quiet respect for at least staying the course			1
he may have been a polarizing figure but that cheeky charisma and flagrant disregard for the rules left no one unaware of who he was			0
sly old @entity18 , for all his schoolboy jokes , held together some of the longest - serving governments in the history of the @entity7 and though his agenda today may not tally with that of a serious country , his party 's latest incarnation won a third of the vote at the last elections			1
in @entity7 , one quickly learns that few actually admit to supporting @entity18 yet each time the country votes his followers flock to the ballot box in droves			1
read more : a look at @entity18 's life the truth is in years gone by @entity18 's confidence and swagger were contagious			2
his secret : in the absence of any committed opposition to appeal to voters ' guilty pleasures , even if that meant offending everyone from ethnic minorities to @entity110 along the way			0
millions of @entity7 were lulled into a false sense of security by the kind of populist rhetoric only the really , really rich like @entity18 can spout with a straight face			2
but in an age when @entity7 needs to re-establish its credibility and pay off its debts his views are outdated , vacuous and inappropriate			0
the tycoon 's recent attempt to jeopardize his country 's future wellbeing merely to save his fading political career was nakedly selfish and fatally misjudged			2
it bore the hallmarks of an increasingly desperate septuagenarian who faces the prospect of retirement with fear and dread			0
not even the prospect of a fiancee almost 50 years his junior will be enough to keep him at home , much to @entity7 's chagrin			1
even if he is ejected from the state 's decision - making bodies , it 's unlikely what 's left of @entity18 's clout will disappear overnight			2
his vast media empire will lobby from behind the scenes in print and on tv , employing guerrilla tactics to undermine the tough austerity @entity7 's new leaders must pursue if they have a hope of fixing its perilous finances			1
and so , as @entity18 contemplates his future and a year 's sentence under possible house arrest , the @entity7 may have finally realized this entertaining former leader is no longer good for their country			1
what they certainly know though is life will be more mundane without him .			0

@entity18 , @entity7 's ultimate comeback king , might finally be out of politics for good
@entity165 says the political message is now more than just goodbye -- this time it 's good riddance
for all his pantomime charades however , he did earn some respect for staying the course
but @entity7 appear to have finally realized he is no longer good for the country
