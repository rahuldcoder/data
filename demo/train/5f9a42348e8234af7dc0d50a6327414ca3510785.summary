two men behind bars for more than half their lives over a triple murder walked free this week after dna evidence tore holes in their convictions			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were teenagers when prison doors clanked shut behind them			1
now , in their late 30s , they can hardly believe they 're out			0
what does freedom feel like ? " i 'm still going through it right now , " @entity7 said friday			1
" i have n't slept yet			0
i 've been up for two days now			0
i have no words for it right now			0
" nearly 22 years of hard time imagine more than two decades in a maximum security prison			2
add to that the fact that you 're accused of killing your mother , your sister and your cousin			1
as if that 's not enough , you were the one who discovered their lifeless , bloodied bodies when you opened the door to your home one night			2
if it 's hard to imagine what that 's like , @entity7 will tell you			1
after years in @entity38 's maximum security prison among @entity40 's toughest criminals , he left its high , gray walls behind him thursday			1
" it was a nightmare , " @entity7 told @entity45 's @entity44 in an exclusive interview			1
" twenty - one years and seven months was more like 42 years and seven months , when you know you 're in prison for something you did n't do			2
" after reviewing dna evidence , district attorney @entity52 said the previous convictions for the 1992 murders in @entity56 would most likely not stand up in court again and agreed the two men should be freed			1
" anybody looking at this evidence with an open mind would see that there is no chance in the world that @entity65 murdered his mother and these two little girls , " his lawyer @entity59 said			0
and that goes beyond the dna evidence alone			1
@entity59 was convinced @entity7 was innocent years before			1
at least one false confession detectives coerced out of a scared teenage boy over 20 years ago led to the convictions			1
a night out after a night of partying , @entity7 , 18 at the time , and @entity8 , 15 , went home to @entity73			1
@entity8 was staying with friends , they said			1
when @entity7 got home , he opened the door to find his mother , sister and a close family friend lying stabbed and strangled to death			1
the two girls were partially undressed			0
" i was asked to come down to the precinct , " he said			0
officers said they wanted him to tell them who might have killed his family , he said			0
" before you know it , i had this photograph shoved in my face , and i was being threatened and slapped around , and they wanted me to sign a false confession			0
and i would n't , " @entity7 said			1
police also took in @entity8 and questioned him separately from @entity96			2
but he got similar treatment , he said			0
" i was scared , afraid ; i was lied to , manipulated into believing that i was going to go home , if i do tell ... what they said happened			0
faced with a life behind bars , the young boy cooperated for the promise of lighter treatment			0
life in prison the two were convicted in separate trials			2
@entity7 was sentenced to 75 years to life			2
@entity8 got a lower sentence of nine years to life			2
they sat behind bars for about 12 years , then something important arrived by mail			0
" @entity117 , i got a letter from his ( @entity7 's ) aunt , " @entity8 said			1
" and she asked me , did we really do it			0
and i had to tell the truth			0
" he wrote back to her : " i was wrong for turning on him , but i was scared and pressured into it			0
" we 're innocent , he told her			0
" for many years i felt horrible that i had to do that and that i actually did it knowing that we were n't guilty for a crime we did n't commit , " @entity8 said			1
" i still feel horrible now , " he said , sitting next to @entity96			0
@entity8 's letter led lawyer @entity59 and the district attorney @entity52 to review their cases in 2010 -- five years after he sent it			1
wrongful convictions @entity52 came into office in january with promises to restore justice to the wrongfully convicted			0
this case is part of a review of @entity56 killings from the 1980s and early 1990s			0
then , last year , the right shred of evidence came along in the form of a dna sample from a rape - murder committed in 1999			1
it matched dna found under the fingernails of @entity7 's mother , indicating that the same killer probably committed both crimes			1
in 1999 , @entity7 and @entity8 were in prison and could n't have committed the second murder			1
@entity59 called @entity7 in prison to tell him that he was going to be free			1
" when i heard about it , i was extremely overwhelmed , " @entity7 said			2
" and the dna was not the only thing that matched			0
was the same , @entity7 said			2
the victim was stabbed and strangled			0
" @entity162 had finally started to sink in , " he said			0
free at last @entity8 and @entity7 had not seen each other for more than two decades , when they met in court thursday			1
@entity8 approached the man he had testified against			2
" i just wanted to apologize to him for all i put him through , all i went through			0
" @entity7 is still in pain over it , but he faults someone other than @entity8			1
" i know what they did to him , because i know what they did to me , " he said			0
as to finding his relatives ' killer decades later , @entity7 said , " it 's in @entity178 's hand 's now			1
both men celebrated freedom by fulfilling some longings they had for two decades			0
@entity8 filled his mouth with a hot slice of @entity40 pizza			2
@entity7 filled his lungs with @entity186 .			2

it starts with a coerced confession
@entity191 and @entity8 go to prison over a 1992 triple murder
they are convicted for the deaths of @entity7 's mom , sister and cousin
new dna evidence *points* to a different killer , also linked to a second crime
