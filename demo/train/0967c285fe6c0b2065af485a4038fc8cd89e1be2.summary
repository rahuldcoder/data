the deadliest outbreak of ebola virus on record has sparked fears that the killer virus could spread from @entity5 to other regions and continents			0
the outbreak began with just a handful of cases in @entity11 in march			2
since then , that number has grown to 909 confirmed cases and another 414 probable or suspected in that country , @entity15 and @entity16 and @entity17 , according to the @entity18			1
some 729 people of the 1,323 total confirmed and possible infections have died , reports @entity18 as of july 27			2
the @entity18 says " drastic action is needed " to contain @entity23 , warning that previously undetected chains of transmission are boosting the numbers of sick and increasing the chances that the disease spreads from @entity5			1
" this epidemic is without precedent , " said @entity29 , director of operations for @entity30 , also known as @entity30			1
" it 's absolutely not under control , and the situation keeps worsening			0
... there are many places where people are infected but we do n't know about it			2
" what 's the latest ? the @entity23 outbreak has been centered in @entity11 , @entity15 and @entity16 , where authorities have been working to contain the virus			1
in @entity16 , president @entity45 announced wednesday that , " without exceptions , all schools are ordered closed pending further directive from the @entity49			1
" she also declared friday a nonworking day " to be used for the disinfection and chlorination of all public facilities			1
" on the same day , the @entity53 said it was temporarily removing its 340 volunteers from @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity11 due to the outbreak			1
the announcement comes as two @entity53 volunteers were isolated after coming in contact with someone who ended up dying of @entity23 , a spokeswoman for the group said			1
she said these two @entity62 " are not symptomatic , " and the @entity53 will work to return them to the @entity62 once they get medical clearance to travel			0
concerns about @entity23 are n't confined to those three countries			1
last week , a @entity16 government official who had contracted the virus died in isolation at a hospital in @entity70 , @entity17			1
@entity71 , a naturalized @entity62 citizen who worked in @entity16 , flew to @entity17 intending to attend a conference			1
after exhibiting symptoms upon arrival july 20 , he was hospitalized and died on july 25			0
he 's the first @entity62 to die in the outbreak , though two other @entity62 aid workers in @entity16 have contracted @entity23 and are being treated			1
@entity71 's was the only known case in @entity17 , @entity18 said			0
and the @entity79 government convened an emergency meeting to discuss the threat of @entity23 to the @entity79 , even though no case has been reported there			1
officials discussed what measures could be taken if @entity79 nationals in @entity5 should become infected , foreign secretary @entity83 said			0
why was someone infected with @entity23 allowed on a plane ? it is unknown whether @entity71 was displaying symptoms before he flew from @entity91 , @entity16 's capital , to @entity92 and then to @entity93 to switch planes to fly to @entity70			1
his @entity96 - based widow , @entity95 , told @entity97 that he had cared for his ill sister in @entity16 , though she said he did n't know at the time that his sister had @entity23			1
when he arrived in @entity17 , he told officials that he had no direct contact with anyone who had the disease			0
because it takes between two and 21 days before @entity23 symptoms to show , there 's little health officials can do to stop an asymptomatic person from flying to another country , said @entity97 chief medical correspondent @entity111			1
so , serious viruses such as @entity23 may be just " a plane ride away " from reaching the developed world , according to @entity113 of the @entity114 ( @entity114 )			1
mindful of this , @entity17 - based airline companies @entity117 and @entity118 suspended operations at the end of july into @entity91 and @entity123 , the capitals of @entity16 and @entity15 , respectively			1
@entity117 said passengers departing from @entity126 , @entity11 , would be screened for signs of the virus			0
@entity113 says it is unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person 's bodily fluids			0
stressing the key role that those working at airports play in keeping @entity23 in check , the @entity114 spokesman said : " being educated , knowing the symptoms , recognizing what to do , having a response to protocol , knowing who to call -- those are really , really important parts of the global containment strategies to deal with threats like this			1
" what else is being done to stop the spread of the disease ? @entity23 patients are being isolated by health officials in @entity5 , and those who have come into contact with them are being told to monitor their temperatures			2
president @entity45 has closed most of @entity16 's borders with neighboring countries , and the few points of entry that are still open will have @entity23 testing centers			1
the president also placed restrictions on public gatherings and ordered hotels , restaurants and other entertainment venues to play a five - minute video on @entity23 safety			1
the @entity114 has issued an alert to health workers in the @entity62 to watch out for any patients who may have recently traveled to @entity5 and could have contracted the virus			0
why does @entity23 generate such fear ? @entity30 ( @entity30 ) describes @entity23 as " one of the world 's most deadly diseases			2
" " it is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90 % of the people who catch it , causing terror among infected communities , " it says			0
the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 55 % because of early treatment			0
there is also no vaccination against it			0
of @entity23 's five subtypes , the @entity190 strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly			2
the @entity18 said preliminary tests on the ebola virus in @entity11 in march suggested that the outbreak there was this strain , though that has not been confirmed			2
what is @entity23 , and what are its symptoms ? the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which according to the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) , refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding			1
the virus is named after the @entity207 in the @entity190 ( formerly @entity190 ) , where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976			0
early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			2
these symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection			0
the @entity18 says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria , typhoid fever , meningitis or even the plague			2
@entity30 says some patients may also develop a rash , red eyes , hiccups , chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing			0
the early symptoms progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding			2
@entity23 can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests			1
how is it treated ? there are no specific treatments for @entity23			2
@entity30 says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers			0
" this consists of hydrating the patient , maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections , " it says			0
there have been cases of healthcare workers contracting the virus from patients , and the @entity18 has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus			1
carers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose , mouth and eyes			0
@entity30 says it contained a 2012 outbreak in @entity268 by placing a control area around its treatment center			0
an outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases			0
how does it spread ? the @entity18 says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the ebola virus in @entity5 , passing on the virus to other animals			0
humans contract @entity23 through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans			2
@entity30 says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism , chlorine disinfection , heat , direct sunlight , soaps and detergents can kill it			0
@entity30 epidemiologist @entity294 said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water			0
" people who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick : because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient , " she said .			0

there are more than 1,300 confirmed and suspected @entity23 cases , *hundreds* of deaths
@entity16 closes all schools , sets day " for the disinfection ... of all public facilities "
" this epidemic is without precedent , " a *humanitarian* official says
@entity23 is a viral hemorrhagic fever , affecting multiple organs and accompanied by bleeding
