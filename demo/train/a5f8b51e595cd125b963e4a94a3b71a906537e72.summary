-- a nasty collision during a kickoff in 1997 left @entity4 seeing stars			1
the former @entity6 fullback , who spent eight seasons battering through defensive lines in the @entity9 , said the hit left him wondering where he was			1
still , the team 's medical staff looked him over and eventually sent him back out to play , he said			2
" the doctor looked in my eyes , " @entity4 recalled in a statement delivered by his attorney in response to questions from @entity0			1
" he then told me to remember these words , either four or five simple , basic words			2
" but the task proved daunting			0
" it was the weirdest thing ever and most frustrating because at the time i was clamoring to get back into the game , " said @entity4			1
" i was really trying so hard			0
and i remember it being just the most frustrating thing ever			0
" by the second half , he 'd remembered			0
" i went back in the game after halftime and played the rest of the game , " he added in the statement to @entity0			0
a little over a decade later , the former @entity34 is battling the debilitating effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , often known as @entity37 or @entity39 's disease			1
he said his doctors have told him that " there 's no cure , you 're going to die within two to 10 years , and get your affairs in order			0
" since the diagnosis , @entity4 has lost most of the use of his hands and arms			1
he 's also agreed to submit his brain to scientific study following his death			0
whether @entity4 's disease , and those like it , can be linked to the consequences of repeated head trauma is the subject of growing research and the focus of mounting litigation against the @entity9			1
@entity4 is one of hundreds of former @entity9 players and their families currently suing the league for alleged negligence , claiming that it did n't do enough to mitigate the risks despite what many say is an inherently dangerous sport			1
his attorney , @entity69 -- whose @entity71 - based firm represents 137 other players and their families who 've filed a class - action suit against the league -- said @entity4 has likely suffered from undiagnosed concussions			1
he accused the league of deliberately withholding information deemed critical to player safety			1
" at no time did the @entity9 inform @entity81 that he risked severe and permanent brain damage by returning to play too soon after sustaining a concussion , " the lawsuit states			1
" the @entity9 's failure was a substantial cause of his current injuries			1
" stars such as former quarterback @entity88 , as well as running backs @entity89 and @entity91 , have filed similar lawsuits in states across the country			1
attorneys representing @entity89 and @entity91 accuse the league of having used a " hand - picked committee of physicians " to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma , particularly concussions			2
" we do believe the @entity9 knew and had that available information with them for many years now , " said attorney @entity103			1
the league denies the claims and released a statement saying it " has long made player safety a priority and continues to take steps to protect players and to advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions			1
" " the @entity9 has never misled players with respect to the risks associated with playing football , " the statement added			1
" any suggestion to the contrary has no merit			0
" a spokesman for the @entity6 , regarding @entity4 's allegations , referred @entity0 to the league 's statement			1
on sunday , the @entity9 is expected to air a multimillion - dollar commercial during the @entity131 that details the history of the league and emphasizes player health and safety			1
the league has in recent years also made strides to strengthen rules that govern on - the - field conduct while adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- to more independently evaluate injured players			1
in 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a " horse - collar " tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury			2
it also strengthened a 1979 rule prohibiting players from using their helmets to butt , or " spear , " players during a tackle -- a rule that critics often complained had lacked enforcement			2
players like @entity163 ' linebacker @entity162 have since been dealt hefty and repeated fines for helmet - first tackles			2
critics , meanwhile , say the league should have made the changes years ago and have called for more protections			2
part of the issue , noted a former @entity173 linebacker , is a sports culture that largely encourages behavior out - of - step with the recognized risks of head trauma			0
it 's exacerbated when coaches , even at the high school level , say " ' oh , you just got your bell rung			0
get back out there and play , ' " noted @entity183			0
that attitude , he added , can contribute to the risks of long - term brain damage			0
a recent study conducted at @entity189 for the @entity190 found evidence of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a dementia - like brain disease -- had been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former @entity9 players			1
their cases shared a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both , according to the study			0
many of those named in the recent claims , meanwhile , describe a range of common symptoms that include headaches , sleeplessness and dementia			2
but whether the league can be proven liable for alleged mistreatment of players , who often acknowledge the risks and likely also suffered head trauma during their high school and collegiate years , is expected to be the source of a drawn - out legal battle involving a growing number of plaintiffs			1
still , family and friends close to the players are often left to deal with the gritty aftermath of day - to - day living once the bright lights of prime time fades			2
@entity230 , the wife of former @entity232 quarterback @entity231 , who is named in the class - action lawsuit , said she 'd like to organize a support group			0
" we 're all going through the same thing , " said @entity230			0
" it 'd be great for all of us to be able to just sit down and talk together			0
" she says her husband , a 41 - year - old @entity239 native selected in 1994 by the @entity232 , has faced bouts of depression and severe memory loss since his retirement from the league more than a decade ago			2
" i sent him to the supermarket a couple of months ago with a list of a few things , " said @entity230			0
" he went with the list			0
but he forgot what he had to get , and also forgot that he had a list			0
" the former quarterback returned home empty - handed			0
" it 's getting scary , " she said			0
" we had a conversation last night and he does n't even remember it today			0
" i just want some place where my husband can go to get help			0
" part of the claim , the former players ' attorneys say , would be used to establish a fund for former players			2
earlier this week , a panel of judges ruled that mounting claims against the league -- including class - action lawsuits filed in @entity272 , @entity239 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 -- will be consolidated in a federal court in @entity277 .			1
