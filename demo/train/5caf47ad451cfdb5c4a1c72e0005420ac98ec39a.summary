-- the weekend of july 4th is a time for doing @entity2 things : grilling , watching fireworks , ignoring zoning restrictions and setting off your own fireworks			1
but shenanigans are tiring , you know ? the sun will give you a sunburn			1
the grill will make your clothes smell like smoke			1
we at ew much prefer to test our endurance in other ways , mostly by watching tv			1
there 's a whole set of marathons on for the weekend , some highly publicized ( can you make it through three straight days of @entity25 ? ) , some obscure and ready for love ( a marathon of the animated transformers series , which is surely better than seeing the new movie in theaters )			1
we 've compiled a list from friday through sunday below			1
trust us , this is way better than a weekend at the beach			1
