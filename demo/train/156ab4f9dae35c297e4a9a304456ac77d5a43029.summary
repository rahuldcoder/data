-- @entity2 officials said sunday that the @entity4 nation will create a court focusing on " media crimes , " according to state - run media reports , a move that has fueled fears @entity9 is further intensifying its crackdown on journalists			1
@entity12 , the head of @entity2 's @entity13 , said the new judicial branch " was necessitated by the special media crimes , " according to a report in @entity17 , a conservative publication run by backers of parliamentary speaker and @entity9 mayor @entity21			1
" for certain reasons , such as great developments in mass media , the @entity9 prosecutor felt the need to create a more independent court to deal with media affairs , " @entity12 said			1
@entity29 , a native @entity2 and @entity31 - based freelance journalist who said he talks regularly with journalists in @entity2 , said the new apparatus could spell greater attention , and prosecution , of those who do n't mimic @entity38 government positions			1
" the fear is that the media ... will be watched more intensely than in the past , " said @entity29			0
" they will have more money , more judges and more people to focus on the media and target journalists			1
" according to the @entity48 , 34 journalists were detained at the end of last year in @entity2 -- tying it with @entity51 for the most imprisoned journalists of any country			1
they include @entity54 , editor of the news website @entity56 , who landed behind bars after reporting on detainees who were raped and tortured in @entity59			0
just last week , the advocacy group delivered a petition signed by 1,102 people to @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity64 urging @entity2 to end what it called its " unjustifiable crackdown " on the media			1
@entity29 said that , in the present system , journalists can not publicize any information -- especially if it could be construed as critical -- unless it is from a government source or ran on a state - sponsored media outlet first			1
he himself was editor of a publication in @entity2 from 2003 through 2005 , the same year that he won @entity76 's @entity75			2
" you can not criticize government policies ... if somebody says something inappropriate , you can not report that , " said @entity29 , whose work has appeared on the website @entity81 , in the @entity82 and elsewhere			0
" the government has an official narrative ( and ) no one can challenge that			0
" currently , cases involving journalists are tried in @entity2 's @entity13			1
but @entity12 told @entity92 that the explosion of mass media , including the @entity95 and satellite communications , prompted the judicial system change			0
@entity98 , @entity9 's chief prosecutor , said " cultural and media crimes " will be addressed exclusively in the new court " so that they can be dealt with by specialists , " according to the official @entity100			1
" the intention is not to replace the country 's cultural organizations with this court , " @entity98 said			2
the new media court will likely start on or around march , @entity109 , secretary of @entity2 's supervising media board , told the semiofficial @entity112			1
@entity113 predicted its judges will do a " great job ( to ) protect the rights of those working the media and will bring about judicial justice			2
" " it is now much easier for people to connect with each other and , therefore , certain new crimes are being committed that can not be overlooked , " he added , according to a translation of his remarks from @entity17			0
sunday 's announcement comes days after the fall of @entity131 president @entity130			0
the head of @entity2 's @entity133 and other @entity2 authorities had lauded this development , comparing " the @entity136 with the victory of @entity2 's @entity138 , " according to @entity2 's state - run media			1
but while publicly praising the @entity131 revolution , the @entity2 government has rounded up activists after @entity2 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally monday in support of the uprising in @entity131			2
on saturday , @entity2 authorities had blocked key internet searches in an apparent effort to obstruct access to sites touting the rally , according to an opposition website and two @entity9 residents			2
@entity2 authorities on wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold a rally			2
@entity159 told the state - run @entity100 , " we definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force			2
" the @entity167 says such threats to stifle dissent and mass communication suggest that @entity2 's government is not willing to let its people voice their views and embrace freedom			0
" they are scared , " press secretary @entity175 said friday , hours after @entity130 stepped down			0
" that 's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this			0
that 's why they have shut off all measure of communication			0
" even with restrictions on journalists , @entity29 said many @entity2 have been able to track recent developments in @entity131 and elsewhere in forums beyond state - run media , including watching news reports from international media and viewing stories online			1
he said independent journalists still exist within @entity2 , even after a massive crackdown following popular unrest after the 2009 elections			1
their accounts may become important if , as he predicts , opposition forces find renewed strength and voice their views publicly in the coming days			0
" we challenge the narrative of the government , " @entity29 said , noting that reports get out funneled through journalists like himself and posted online more anonymously			0
" they do their role , even if they do n't go public in that role			0

@entity2 officials say a new special court will focus on " media crimes , " state media say
the court will include justices specializing in media , cultural issues
a @entity31 - based @entity2 journalist say independent media will likely be even more targeted
a journalist rights group says 34 journalists are jailed in @entity2 , as much as in any nation
