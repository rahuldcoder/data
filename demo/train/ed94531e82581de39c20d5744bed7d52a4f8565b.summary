@entity0 -- as anti-wall street protests continued across the country , several hundred people gathered thursday in the nation 's capital in a scheduled anti-war demonstration that also adopted new overtones in decrying economic disparities			0
demonstrators first congregated in the shadow of @entity13 , at its height filling about half of @entity0 's @entity16 , which is about the size of a city block			1
many carried placards and listened to speeches from activists railing against inequality , corporate greed , as well as the @entity26 - led wars in @entity27 and @entity28			1
the protest came a day before @entity26 marks the 10th anniversary of the start of the @entity28 conflict , and a day after the release of a @entity37 survey in which @entity26 veterans expressed ambivalence about both wars			1
half of the 712 who have served since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks said they felt the @entity28 war was worth it , while 44 % made the same assessment about the @entity27 conflict			0
this aspect of the poll had a margin of error of 5.7 percentage points			0
yet military conflict was just one of the topics addressed thursday			0
others focused on economics , in the same spirit of demonstrations that have cropped up in more than a dozen @entity26 cities			1
the hub of the " @entity62 " movement fittingly has been in @entity63 , with many rallying and camping out there and elsewhere to protest on a wide range of mostly economic issues			1
the @entity0 protesters , for one , spelled out the number " 99 " with a human chain that seemed to loop around @entity16			1
it is a reference to the group 's claim that 99 % of @entity26 are underrepresented in the country 's current political and financial systems , while the other 1 % of the population wields too much influence			2
by late afternoon , part of the group broke off and headed toward the @entity80			2
there , in front of a two - story banner in front of the building that reads " jobs : brought to you by @entity26 free enterprise , " the demonstrators chanted , " where are the jobs ? " speaking at a news conference earlier thursday , president @entity92 said demonstrators -- in @entity0 , as well as those in @entity63 and other cities nationwide -- " are giving voice to a more broad - based frustration about how our financial system works			1
" but @entity92 also defended the country 's financial sector , saying , " we have to have a strong , effective financial sector in order for us to grow			0
" thursday 's demonstration is not the first in @entity0 about economic matters			0
a day earlier , several hundred union and progressive activists sought to capitalize on the growing " @entity62 " protests with a @entity113 rally demanding new public spending on job creation and an end to federal budget cuts			0
the event , led by former @entity121 clean energy adviser @entity119 , highlighted growing liberal frustration with a public policy agenda increasingly dominated by deficit reduction efforts and difficulty in implementing more traditional economic stimulus measures as well as revenue increases			2
@entity1 's @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
