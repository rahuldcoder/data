-- @entity2 community leaders in @entity3 say sectarian tensions are soaring , as radicalized @entity6 youth , inspired by @entity7 , seek to import the religious conflicts wracking the @entity9			1
" the tensions are very high and will continue to be high , " said @entity10 , a @entity11 community leader in @entity12 , where a 47 - year old @entity11 leader was shot in the shoulder early monday morning , as worshipers observed the @entity11 ritual of @entity17			1
he said @entity19 , a leader in the @entity11 community focused around the @entity22 center in @entity23 , south - west @entity12 , had been released from hospital on tuesday and was doing well			1
the attack was only one incident in a string of attacks and threats against @entity30 by @entity6 extremists who sympathized with @entity7 , he claimed , and had followed an incident where a group of men had driven past the @entity22 center , yelling comments such as " is lives forever " and " @entity11 dogs " in @entity40			1
a security guard had also been attacked by a group of men who appeared to be followers of the austere @entity46 tradition of @entity6 on friday , he said			2
" there 's high tension between @entity6 and @entity11 , but these extremists , they threaten and attack @entity6 too , " he said			1
" anyone who speaks against the fighting in @entity54 and advocating the government to take action against people in @entity58 and @entity54 -- they are threatened and attacked			0
" @entity59 , a @entity12 - based gp and @entity6 community leader , agreed , saying sectarian tensions were at an unprecedented level as a result of the brutal @entity54 conflict , and the appeal of @entity7 to radicalized @entity6 youth in @entity3			1
" this is the highest level i 've ever seen , and it 's been like this since @entity75 got his son to hold up that severed head , " he said , referring to the notorious @entity3 @entity7 jihadist who tweeted a picture of his seven - year - old son posing with the body parts of a dead fighter in august			1
' death cult influence ' on tuesday , @entity3 prime minister @entity79 told reporters that " it seems there is an @entity7 death cult influence on this shooting in @entity12 , " using an alternative name for the terror group			1
" the important thing is for all of us to absolutely reject this death cult , " he said			0
some @entity3 media reports suggested a leadership dispute at the @entity22 center could have been the reason behind the attack , but @entity10 rejected the notion , saying the dispute was being litigated in the courts and it was highly unlikely that it would take a violent turn			2
a @entity102 police spokesman said there was nothing to add beyond the police 's initial statement calling for public information on the shooting			0
@entity79 's government has been a strident supporter of @entity112 efforts to combat the @entity6 extremist group , which controls large swathes of @entity54 and @entity58			0
it has deployed jets and military troops in the fight , introduced controversial legislation to imprison @entity3 found to be fighting abroad or supporting terrorist actions , and conducted large - scale anti-terror raids , claiming to have disrupted a plot to kidnap and behead a random member of the public			2
authorities believe around 60 @entity3 are fighting in the conflict in @entity54 and @entity58 , with around 100 more working in support roles within @entity3			2
but @entity10 said he was yet to see the fruits of @entity79 's tough talk about reining in @entity3 's radicalized @entity2 youth			1
" we thought a lot of the radical @entity22 centers would be closed , well - known extremists would be rounded up and put behind bars , " he said			0
" it 's all talk			0
" doubly under fire sectarian tensions were a new phenomenon for @entity3 's @entity2 community , said @entity59			1
during previous periods when @entity3 @entity30 had felt under attack -- such as in the wake of the september 11 attacks , the @entity146 bombings or the @entity148 riots -- they had bonded together under a common identity			2
but now many in the community felt doubly under fire -- from sectarian agitators and from " rednecks " in the wider public , said @entity10			0
@entity59 said that from the early days of the @entity54 conflict , @entity6 extremists had inflamed community tensions by attempting to " name and shame " businesses on social media that were run by members of @entity165 sect , to which @entity54 president @entity166 belongs			1
" they will use any excuse to create division , " he said			0
@entity59 said he remained optimistic			0
" the forces that pull us apart are increasing in strength , but they are nowhere as strong as the forces that pull us together , " he said			0
but @entity10 did not believe things would improve soon			0
" it is a very tough time , and we expect it to become more tough , " he said .			0
