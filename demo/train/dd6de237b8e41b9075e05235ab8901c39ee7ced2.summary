@entity0 had promised the @entity2 goddess @entity1 that he would offer her a male goat if one of his children found a job			1
last year his son was successful -- and on saturday he was one of tens of thousands of people killing the animals at the temple of @entity1 in southern @entity12 as part of the biggest religious mass slaughter in the world			1
" from my village everyone has made a vow [ to offer animals ] , " says @entity16 from @entity17 , a community in @entity19 about 60 miles south of @entity20			2
some , he explains , are glad they have got a son or a daughter , others that a different form of good fortune has befallen them			2
the ritual sacrifice of goats , buffaloes and roosters in temples and at home is widespread in @entity12 where 80 percent of the population are @entity2			1
some five million people from adjoining districts -- and also from the bordering @entity41 states of @entity42 and @entity43 -- will attend the festival , according to local authorities , although only two days are dedicated to the sacrificial ritual itself			1
the slaughter follows a set pattern : on friday male water buffalo calves are killed while on saturday attentions switches to goats			1
officials estimate that up to 10,000 buffalo calves and 150,000 goats will be offered to @entity1 -- the goddess of power -- during the ritual			1
watch a @entity60 report on the ritual but these numbers will be much lower than those of 2009 , the last time the five - yearly @entity1 festival took place , thanks to advocacy efforts by animal rights activists			1
in that year nearly 20,000 buffalo calves were killed , according to temple officials and more than 200,000 goats were slaughtered			1
" we object to the cruelty with which animals are treated , " says @entity72 of @entity73			0
" there is random hacking of animals in open space			0
not all animals have their heads chopped off			0
some take up to 40 minutes to die			0
" the participants -- who hack the animals in an enclosed arena with large knives -- are licensed by the @entity85			0
this year about 400 people will kill animals , according to @entity16 , who is also the committee 's secretary			2
the animals not only suffer while they are being killed : they are also transported over long distances on foot			0
" by the time they get to the festival venue they are half dead , " says @entity72			2
" they are kept two or three days without food after they are brought here			0
" activists have gone to the courts in @entity12 and @entity41 to halt the sacrifices			1
last month @entity12 's @entity101 did not stop the animal sacrifices but ruled that existing laws have to be followed			1
" if the existing laws are implemented there would be no ritual sacrifices , " says @entity104 , the lawyer who filed the case , explaining that only animals killed in a slaughterhouse are fit to be eaten			0
( the meat of the sacrificed animal is usually eaten , or given away to meat - eaters for their consumption			2
) courts in @entity41 also directed the @entity41 government not to control the unnecessary export of animals to @entity12			1
the @entity41 authorities , for their part , had directed security agencies and state governments to check the flow of livestock to the neighboring country			0
in a letter to the @entity43 government seen by @entity128 , @entity41 's @entity125 estimated in september as many as 90,000 buffaloes would be " illegally " transported to @entity12 for the festival			1
but animals continue to flow into @entity12 through the porous and open border			1
" the border can not be controlled and corruption is endemic , " says @entity72			0
@entity12 authorities are also reluctant to stop the ritual sacrifice			1
" we can not do this , " explains chief district officer @entity136			0
" we can not speak against it			0
this is something to do with culture			0
" @entity16 adds : " if we tell the people to stop the sacrifices , they will come to kill us			0
this is something related to people 's religion and faith			2
" @entity2 religion does not support the ritual sacrifice of animals , says @entity72			1
" we consulted religious priests on the matter , " she says			0
activists in @entity1 , meanwhile , are confident that there will be changes in people 's attitudes			1
@entity160 , from @entity17 , claims that some 40 percent of the women in the village have said that they will not sacrifice animals			0
three years ago he started a campaign showing videos of cruelty to animals at the festival to villagers			1
while awareness is being raised at a local level , he believes binding laws are still needed to stop the sacrifices			0
" all living creatures are equal in the eyes of god , " he says			0
" instead of animals we can offer gourds , pumpkins , coconuts and sweets to the goddess			2
" the festival management committee can not stop the animal sacrifices , but if the government asks the committee can discuss the issue , says @entity16			1
@entity72 and other activists had been working with the government since the last festival in 2009 to stop the sacrifices but although there was some progress , a government decision was not reached			1
meanwhile , on friday morning tens of thousands of people gathered around the temple in @entity19 , southern @entity12 , waiting for the sacrificial ritual to begin			1
" people seem to be in a merry mood and look like they have been waiting for this moment for ages , " says @entity198 , an animal welfare activist , from @entity17			2
" but it is a sad day for us			0
" he estimates 6,000 to 8,000 water buffaloes will be randomly hacked , not necessarily by having their heads chopped off			2
" any part of the body can be cut , " he says			0
" last time round we saw buffalo walking with their head hanging			2

thousands of water buffalo and goats will be slaughtered in @entity12 's @entity1 festival
held every five years , the festival is dedicated to a @entity2 goddess of power
animal rights activists have campaigned to change attitudes and reduce the killing
