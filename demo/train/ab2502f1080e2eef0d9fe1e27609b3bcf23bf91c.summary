-- yes , it 's @entity2 again , time to bust out the champagne and make resolutions you probably wo n't keep			2
but this year 's different			2
cities around the world were hosting some of the most amazing celebrations ever			0
edible confetti raining over @entity10 ? check			1
how about 400,000 pyrotechnics exploding over @entity12 ? that happened , too			1
and let 's not forget that the new year also means bizarre new laws			1
here 's what people experienced across the globe : 1			2
taste the rainbow why have a fireworks show that only looks good ? revelers in @entity10 stuck out their tongues during tuesday 's extravaganza and enjoyed banana - flavored confetti that was choreographed to the fireworks			1
they also saw floating oranges drifting through the night sky and popped them to enjoy a citrusy scent ! food artists @entity31 and @entity33 worked working on the show for an entire year			2
they even made sure their edible treats were kosher , vegan and hypoallergenic			2
" we developed a special confetti that 's actually biodegradable , and in the rain it will magically dissolve , " @entity31 said			1
" even better , it tastes amazing			0
@entity12 goes big -- really big in @entity12 -- a city obsessed with superlatives -- organizers pulled off a world record for the biggest fireworks display near the world 's tallest building			1
the spectacular show featured 400,000 pyrotechnics over 400 parts of the @entity12 shoreline			1
that 's 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) of waterfront lighting up			2
the @entity56 staff later labeled it the largest ever			1
the show blew @entity60 's world record out of the water when last year it set off 77,000 fireworks over 64 minutes			1
if you were there , send your photos or video to @entity69 ! 3			0
have a ball -- an ' odd ' ball sure , @entity71 has a massive sparkly ball they 've been dropping for the past century or so			0
but what other objects can you relinquish to gravity to mark the new year ? in some @entity79 cities , it 's a fruit			1
in @entity81 , it 's a colossal glowing pineapple			2
in @entity83 , it 's a giant peach			1
the @entity85 mountain town of @entity86 prefers a possum -- slowly lowered and then set free			0
but @entity88 , @entity89 , takes the cake with its drag queen drop			1
for years , female impersonator @entity92 has been lowered from the @entity94 in @entity88 while riding in a massive high - heel shoe			2
" it was inspired by ' @entity99 ' when it first came out , with the whole high heel on top of the bus , " said @entity96 , owner of @entity97 " i wanted to take that idea and do something fun on @entity2			0
25 hours of celebrations @entity107 and @entity108 are virtually neighbors , with just 101 miles between them			0
but they 're also 25 hours apart			0
so one was among the first to ring in the new year ; the other will be among the last			0
how can this happen ? let 's just say the international date line is n't even close to a straight line			0
and because the date line is n't fixed by any international law or agreement , it can zig and zag to accommodate government and business interests			0
it 's as close to a time machine as we 'll probably get			0
yes to placentas , no to shark fins more than 40,000 new laws will take effect in the @entity79 on @entity129			1
while @entity132 's legalization of marijuana has racked up plenty of headlines , here are some of the more peculiar ones : in @entity139 , mothers will be allowed to take their placentas home from the hospital			1
some say placenta capsules can help with postpartum depression , @entity0 affiliate @entity142 reported , though there 's not a lot of medical research backing that up			0
@entity149 will join a growing number of states where you ca n't own , sell or distribute shark fins , which is considered a delicacy in some @entity156 cuisine			1
and thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines			0
because if you 're going to a vending machine , clearly you care the most about calories , right ? depends on what day of the resolution you 're on			0
@entity0 's @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
