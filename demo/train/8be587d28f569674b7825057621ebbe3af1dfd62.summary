-- @entity1 is in trouble			1
just look at recent polls : 70 % of @entity1 would describe the nation 's economy as bad			1
some 61 % think our country is on the wrong track			0
only 24 % of @entity1 think the economy has actually improved in the past few years			1
and almost two - thirds of @entity1 are concerned about being able to pay for their housing			2
we could use captain economy to help us create jobs			1
plus we need @entity16 and @entity17			0
or maybe we can just let the @entity18 loose in @entity19 and tell him : " hulk : smash ! " ( i 'm not sure how @entity18 smashing @entity19 helps the economy , but i think most of us would pay to see it			0
) but , alas , there 's no superhero in no sight			2
there 's only president @entity28 or @entity29			1
i must admit that there was a time in 2008 that i thought @entity28 could have been a superhero , but i was wrong			2
we have seen his campaign theme morph in four years from " @entity33 " to " it could be worse			0
" in @entity28 's defense , his economic plan has helped the nation			1
unemployment was at 10 % in october 2009 and has fallen to 8.1 % , and we have seen moderate job creation			0
but still the economy has a long way to go to match the booming growth years of the mid- 2000s			0
we had a 4.6 % unemployment rate just five years ago			0
so here comes superhero wannabe @entity29			2
this silver - spooned crusader has attacked @entity28 by stating , " we are enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history			2
" @entity29 essentially admits the economy has improved since @entity28 took office but claims that he has the super powers that will launch our nation to infinity and beyond			1
or at least , as he promised this week , his economic plan would lower the nation 's unemployment rate to 6 % in four years			2
what 's @entity29 's solution ? his website outlines a proposal for economic recovery , promising a five - point plan that he will submit immediately upon taking office , then " demand that @entity19 act on the package within 30 days			1
" but i think @entity29 might find that @entity19 wo n't be pushed around as easily as a blonde - haired kid in high school			2
all the " demanding " in the world might not get @entity19 to do what he wants			0
@entity29 : i 'll get unemployment down to 6 % @entity29 calls for tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations , but his big push to revitalize the economy is to reduce the deficit by cutting government spending			1
here is my question for mr. @entity29 : can you please show us where this type of austerity has worked before ? i 'm all ears			1
the most recent example is the @entity84 , where conservative prime minister @entity85 slashed government spending in 2010 with the promise of economic growth			0
the result ? the unemployment rate rose in 2011 , and @entity91 contracted for the past two quarters , meaning that the nation is now back in a recession			0
in contrast , last week we learned that @entity98 's economy grew by an annualized rate of 4.1 % in the first quarter this year			1
was @entity98 's growth spurt caused by cutting government spending as @entity29 wants ? nope			1
the @entity98 government increased expenditures			0
while the government spending did increase the deficit , it sparked much - needed economic growth			0
if either candidate is going to make super promises about revitalizing the economy , he 'll have to prove his ideas have worked in the past			1
and if he ca n't do that , he should at least be brutally honest and tell us there are no easy answers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121			0

@entity121 : @entity1 's economy in trouble , needs an " @entity126 " superhero
captain economy , @entity129 would be nice ; reality is @entity28 , @entity29
he says @entity29 promises government cuts , but where has austerity worked ?
*writer* : candidates , level with *voters* : there 's no superhero plan for recovery ' it 'll be a slog
