here 's how : 1			0
start chatting with someone ( pretty simple )			0
when you 'd like to refer to a mutual friend or , say , @entity23 , you dump their profile id ( either their name or a string of numbers for those users who have n't claimed their choice @entity30 ) into double brackets			1
so , that would be [ [ cocacola ] ] for a picture of @entity23 , [ [ zuck ] ] for @entity36 and [ [ mashable ] ] for the logo of where your learned about this new feature , and so on			0
@entity40 everyone on @entity2 chat with this cool new gimmick			1
