@entity0 , @entity1 -- there is a skull here , hundreds of fragments of bones there			2
table after table is lined with human remains			1
one holds a near - complete skeleton , another has hundreds of tiny pieces of bone that could come from many different people			2
together , it tells the story of life and death in the military			1
at the world 's largest skeletal identification laboratory more than 30 forensic anthropologists , archaeologists and dentists of @entity24 are working to put names to the remains			1
based at @entity0 -- site of the @entity30 attack -- in @entity31 , @entity1 , @entity24 is made up of all branches of the @entity35 military and civilian scientists , united in the goal of bringing back all 84,000 @entity35 service members who went missing during war or military action			1
the unit researches old war records and combs battle sites and aircraft crash sites in some of the most remote locations around the world			1
any recovered remains are brought back to @entity24 's @entity47			1
the mission is to bring answers to families who may have been waiting 60 years or more to hear anything about a loved one			1
they call it the most honorable mission in the military			1
" i 've been all over the world from @entity59 to @entity60 , @entity61 to @entity62 and then , of course , in @entity64 and my job is to defeat the enemy			2
i am proud of that , " says lt. col. @entity67 , who works at @entity24 managing 18 teams who search for remains			1
" this job , though , has been one of the more healing jobs in a sense that instead of doing what i am normally planning on doing and training to do , i 'm bringing people back together , bringing families back together , bringing closure and it is truly , deep down inside , one of the most rewarding experiences			0
" dr. @entity82 , a forensic anthropologist at @entity47 and head of the forensic science academy there			0
" the task is daunting			0
it goes to the peaks of the @entity90 , it goes to the jungles of @entity92			0
it goes to the oceans of the @entity95			0
so from the highest point to the lowest point on the earth , we 're looking for missing @entity35			1
" the mission can start in many different ways , possibly a tip from a veteran who remembers where he lost a fellow soldier during a hectic battle , or even from someone finding remains while digging in their yard			1
most of the time , investigations begin with a researcher or historian who searches military records known as @entity116			1
the files include information about where a service member was lost and how that person may have died			1
it 's the researcher 's role to figure out if there is enough evidence to search a site			0
" we 'll look at all the evidence and say is it going to be worth it to actually go to the site ? " explains historian @entity127			0
" and if it is , the next time we 're in that country , we 'll put that on the list			1
and we 'll go to the site and we 'll locate and question any witnesses			0
" " i think one of the most interesting parts of my job is just learning these cases individually , " @entity127 says			0
" i think one of the things about @entity144 is just the size of it , just the numbers you 're talking about			0
we 're missing upwards of 74,000 @entity35			1
" when you 're dealing with those kinds of numbers , it 's really interesting to look at these cases on an individual basis and learn little bits , little tidbits of information about these guys			0
you know , where they were from , what particular mission they were on , that kind of thing			1
" once a site is approved , an investigation team interviews possible witnesses and does a preliminary search of the grounds			0
if they find enough evidence that remains are present a recovery team is sent back to the site to dig for remains			1
recovery sites can be grueling			1
wars are often fought far away from the comforts of home , and the recovery teams sometimes camp at a dig site for up to 60 days			0
the end result -- finding a service member who 'd been lost for decades -- makes it all worthwhile			2
" i got here in 1992 and about the first five years i was in the jungles , " @entity82 says , who with other anthropologists and archaeologists goes on recovery missions as well as working in the lab. " i went native			0
i got out there and i did n't want to come back because it was so exciting			0
it was such an invigorating thing and i felt as though i was doing something really good to bring home these missing @entity35			1
" once you do this , you get the bug , you realize what your contribution can be to science , what your contribution can be to the @entity35			1
and to these guys and gals who served and gave everything			0
" i feel as though this is something that i can give back to those folks who served and to those families who are out there still that are looking for answers			0
i think it is the most exciting thing anybody could ever do			0
" @entity82 has been on digs with veterans who return to the site of terrifying battles to help them figure out where to find lost soldiers			2
and when remains are brought back to @entity47 , @entity82 is one of the anthropologists trying to put a name to the remains -- a very long and intense process			1
the work begins by identifying sex , age at death , racial or ancestral background , how tall the individual was , and what kind of trauma the person received			0
@entity82 explains the process , starting with first knowing where the remains were recovered			2
" so you 've narrowed it down geographically			0
then you end up with say 20 individuals that are missing within a 20 - mile radius of where these remains were recovered			1
" you 've now got it down to 20 individuals			0
and now the biology , the anthropology is going to say " well this is a 20 - 24 year old white male			0
" you 've narrowed it down again			0
how tall is he ? he 's about 5 ' 8 to 5 ' 9			0
and you can see you keep narrowing and narrowing and narrowing it to where you get it down to where the dental says , it is this individual right here			2
" dental records , when they 're available , are often the key to making a final identification			1
lt. col. @entity266 is a forensic odontologist -- a dentist who compares dental remains to dental records to make an identification			1
" if a body is found and there are different types of dental restorations in the mouth -- say a metal crown , maybe a white filling , a composite filling or a resin filling -- those are very unique things in individual mouths and it sets them apart from somebody else who does not have those things in their teeth			2
so the dental profile can be very unique to one individual			2
" but not all remains include the jaw or teeth , which is why the scientists at @entity47 are constantly looking for new technology			1
another identification technique is comparing mitochondrial dna found in bones -- not the same type that can be extracted through saliva or blood -- to dna extracted from a maternal lineage			2
the scientists are also testing out a new way to use the old method of photo superimposition			1
using two cameras -- one on a photograph , the other on a skull -- they are trying to determine the accuracy of layering a photo over a skull to make identifications			2
it is a mission this unit says it will never tire of			2
" technology changes , technology evolves and gets better , " says @entity82			0
" so what we ca n't do today with this one little piece of bone , we might be able to do tomorrow with @entity293			0
" and we 're going to keep searching , we 're going to keep trying , and we 're not going to give up on these guys and gals who are missing			2

scientists and historians , military and civilians aim to recover all missing @entity35 service personnel
the @entity24 digs at battle sites and crash sites for remains
in the lab they use dental records , photo recognition *software* and dna tests to put a name to the remains
they call it the most honorable mission in the military
