-- the promoter for @entity3 world champion boxer @entity2 , @entity4 , has confirmed the " super fight " with @entity9 @entity8 will not happen after mediation talks between the two parties failed			1
" the fight is off , @entity8 walked away , " @entity4 told the @entity11 newspaper in a telephone interview on wednesday			2
@entity2 and @entity8 had asked retired federal judge @entity14 to help the two parties resolve a dispute , which had threatened to derail what was expected to be the most lucrative bout in the history of the sport			1
however , after two days of further negotiation , @entity4 said no agreement could be made with @entity8 , with the result that both fighters would now miss out on a potential purse of $ 40 million each			2
" it 's not surprising			0
i always felt that he was n't going to do the fight			0
he knows @entity2 will beat him			0
@entity8 's never stepped into the ring with a guy he had any question but that he was going to beat			0
our guy was agreeable , @entity8 was n't , " the @entity33 promoter said			1
" that 's why there 's never been a ( @entity39 ) @entity38 , there 's never been a ( @entity42 ) @entity41 , there never was a ( @entity45 ) @entity44 , and there 's no @entity2			0
" @entity8 is a coward			0
he will never fight anyone that will remotely give him a tough fight			0
" it would 've made millions and millions , and he walked away from it ... i 'm not disappointed in the sense that i always knew it was going to be this way			0
" the welterweight title bout was thrown into doubt when @entity8 demanded that random drugs testing should be employed before the fight , a request that prompted @entity2 to take legal action for defamation			1
@entity4 said @entity2 will turn his attention to fighting undefeated @entity67 @entity66 super welterweight champion @entity65 on march 13 or march 20			1
@entity3 pugilist @entity2 had been infuriated by the insistence of @entity8 and his team at @entity70 that both fighters submit to @entity73 - style blood testing in the buildup to their pay - per - view extravaganza			2
@entity2 filed a lawsuit in a federal court in @entity78 last week for defamation against @entity8 and others for allegedly claiming he had used performance - enhancing drugs			2
the bout at welterweight appeared to be virtually set after other issues around the cut of the purse for each fighter were settled , but then the drug - testing row erupted over the @entity90 period			1
@entity2 became a five - weight world champion after his @entity93 welterweight title win over @entity44 in november , while the unbeaten @entity8 returned from a 21 - month retirement to beat @entity96 @entity95 in september .			1

@entity33 promoter @entity4 , confirms the " super fight " with @entity9 @entity8 is off
the two camps failed to resolve a *bitter* dispute over the issue of drug - testing before their match - up
retired judge @entity14 failed to *secure* agreement for what could have been the most lucrative fight in history
@entity2 will now fight undefeated @entity67 @entity66 super welterweight champion @entity65
