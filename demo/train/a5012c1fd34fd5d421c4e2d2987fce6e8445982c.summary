@entity2 hold a 3 - 1 lead going into wednesday 's match at the @entity16 and @entity1 could not resist a pre-match swipe at the @entity19 giants , who would become the first side to retain the @entity10 in its present format			1
but @entity1 , an acknowledged master in pre-match " mind games " , is convinced that the pressure of expectation will work against last season 's triple winners			2
" we have a team of older players , with many over 30 , and we hope that we will be able to cope with the atmosphere			0
it is one thing , though , to follow a dream and it is another to have an obsession , " he told gathered reporters			0
@entity38 's @entity37 set to work a new miracle " for @entity9 it is an obsession , " added @entity1 , who was accompanied by tight security as he returned to the club where he began his coaching career under @entity43			1
" a dream is more pure than an obsession , an obsession is more about pride			0
@entity9 achieved a dream winning the @entity10 in @entity50 and @entity51 last year but this time it is more about @entity12 and playing at the @entity53 , this is an obsession			1
" @entity1 , who claimed the @entity10 during his spell at @entity57 giants @entity56 , realizes that @entity2 are also desperate to triumph in @entity59 's premier club competition having last won it in 1965			1
" i ca n't say for me it is a personal dream as i have won it before but i want to win it for @entity2 as it is more than 40 years since they got to the final			2
" if i can help mr @entity64 ( the @entity2 president ) , if i can help the players and if i can contribute a little bit as coach to achieve this dream then i would be very happy			2
" @entity2 will be without the suspended @entity68 but @entity1 indicated that he would likely take a gamble on key midfielder @entity70 , who has a slight hamstring strain			2
" we will see if he can play for 90 minutes as there is still a small problem			0
we have other important games in the league but i am ready to risk him as everything will be decided tomorrow , " said @entity1			0
@entity9 coach @entity80 said his team were merely focused on earning a final clash against @entity83 , who beat @entity85 4 - 0 on aggregate in the first semifinal			1
" it 's a game of football , not a magic night , and we have to be ourselves -- we will go out and try to generate as many chances as we always do , " he said			0
" we do n't know if we are capable of turning this around , but we will give everything against a great team to try and get to the final , " he added .			0
