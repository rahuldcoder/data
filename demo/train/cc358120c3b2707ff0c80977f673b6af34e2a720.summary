authorities in @entity47 , @entity1 , believe that @entity8 was attacked in a chain of events that began when he did not pay one of the five boys $ 40 for a video game			1
that boy stole @entity8 's father 's bicycle , and when @entity8 told police , the youth was arrested , then released , authorities said			1
the next day , the group of five teens allegedly surrounded @entity8 and , according to eyewitnesses , yelled , " he 's a snitch			2
he 's a snitch " before one of them poured alcohol over him , another sparked a lighter , and @entity8 was ablaze			0
all of the boys had been friends since elementary school , authorities said			0
they did sleepovers at one another 's homes , and their families knew each other			0

he is by no means well ... but the expectation is survival , " he said			0
because he is sedated and on the ventilator , @entity8 has been unable to communicate with detectives			1
earlier this week , prosecutors were granted extra time to build their cases against the five teens , four 15 - year - olds and the 13 - year - old			0
prosecutors have until november 12 to charge the five as adults , or they will be charged as juveniles and released pending trial later			0
the 13 - year - old can not face adult charges under @entity1 law , but that would change if @entity8 died			1
