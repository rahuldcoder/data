-- after months of bloodshed , intrigue and revenge that made @entity5 seem like an @entity7 version of @entity8 , president @entity1 has finally transferred his powers to his vice president , and elections are to be held in three months			1
at the ceremony in @entity13 , @entity14 , to seal the transition deal worked out by the @entity16 , @entity1 seemed relaxed and even chuckled as he signed several copies of the agreement , the result of intense diplomatic shuttling by @entity22 envoy @entity21 and growing pressure from the international community			1
but @entity1 also took a parting shot at his opponents , saying they had destroyed in months everything that had been built over years			1
april @entity29 , @entity5 analyst at the @entity30 , says the @entity13 deal offers an " opportunity to move past the current political impasse and to deal with critical issues like deteriorating economic and humanitarian conditions as well as the very difficult task of institutional reform			1
" even so , @entity29 and other analysts expect the epilogue to be anything but predictable			0
there are plenty of competing elements left behind : the thousands of mainly young demonstrators who took to the streets of @entity52 and other cities in january to demand democratic change , the tribal alliance that took up arms against @entity1 , secessionists in the south and a @entity44 rebellion in the north , well - organized @entity58 groups and a budding @entity60 franchise			1
perhaps the most powerful figure in @entity5 now is @entity62			1
gen. @entity63 , commander of the @entity64			1
he defected in march and took a chunk of the army with him			0
his units now control northern districts of the capital and are facing off against powerful remnants of the @entity1 clan			1
the president 's son , @entity72 , long groomed to be his successor , and his nephew , @entity75 , command the most effective units			1
@entity29 says the @entity16 accord " does not deal effectively with lingering tensions between @entity1 's family on one hand and @entity63 and the powerful @entity80 on the other			1
each of these power centers is heavily armed and still poised to fight			0
" as if to remind the diplomats of the scale of the task ahead , pro- and @entity86 factions clashed in @entity52 hours before the ceremony			1
the challenge of " securing a cease - fire , removing armed tribesmen from urban centers , returning the military to the barracks and engaging in military - security reform will be serious stumbling blocks post-signing , " according to @entity29			0
@entity99 makes some @entity101 officials nervous because of his links with radical @entity103			0
@entity5 observers say the @entity105 has long been influential within @entity63 's military command , and he is known for his antipathy toward @entity5 's @entity44			1
a @entity109 diplomatic cable from 2005 said that " @entity63 's questionable dealings with terrorists and extremists would make his accession unwelcome to the @entity109 and others in the international community			1
" others in this powerful clan include @entity118 , a leader of the @entity119 and a prominent businessman who has long been an opponent of the president			0
his brother @entity122 also has armed supporters in and around @entity52			0
for generations , the @entity5 state has done little without the @entity127 ' blessing			2
@entity128 , who died in 2007 , was one of the few @entity5 to command widespread respect -- a man often described as the father of modern @entity5			2
he was an opposition leader but also speaker of the @entity133 , and @entity1 was careful not to cross him			2
today , there seems no one of similar stature			0
the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have braved gunfire , tear gas and pro-government gangs in @entity52 , @entity142 and elsewhere are unlikely to be satisfied by @entity1 's departure			1
they fear being marginalized by the transfer of power from one clique to another as part of some " tribal bargain " and oppose @entity1 's immunity from prosecution , which is part of the @entity13 deal			1
but @entity29 says they have a role to play			2
" the independent youth in @entity5 have at times been marginalized by the armed conflict			1
while these young people do not have guns or butter , they are beginning to organize and to recognize their potential influence			0
" others who may play a significant role include the cleric @entity166 , who heads the @entity167 ( very conservative ) wing of the @entity169			2
he is feared by liberal @entity5			2
but ultimately , as one @entity109 diplomatic cable sent from @entity52 in 2005 put it , " true power still derives from the military and the tribes			0
" as for the 69 - year old @entity1 himself , a combination of factors probably led him to choose this moment to sign away his powers			1
he still needs medical treatment for the burns sustained in an attack on the @entity183 in june -- injuries that left him in a @entity14 hospital for three months			0
@entity22 @entity186 ban ki - moon said @entity1 told him he would be traveling to @entity187 for treatment soon			2
another possible reason is that @entity1 has seen the violent end of @entity191 and growing pressure on @entity193 in @entity194			2
he also has been subject to intense diplomatic pressure by @entity14 and the @entity22 finally to ratify the @entity16 deal			0
the @entity197 had begun considering sanctions			0
and military units loyal to the president have lost ground in recent weeks			0
but what are his plans now ? no one has the definitive answer			0
the intrigue is reminiscent of the @entity208 in 1815 that drew the @entity211 map of @entity212			0
when the @entity216 envoy died suddenly , @entity214 's @entity213 is reputed to have said : " i wonder what his motive was			0
" whatever power structure emerges , @entity5 's next leaders will face daunting tasks as they inherit a state where oil revenues have declined and the economy is in ruins , where poverty is endemic and a young and rapidly growing population faces a chronic shortage of water			1
not to mention the percolating rebellions in the south and north , and a well - entrenched affiliate of @entity60			0
to recall a line from @entity8 that might well apply to @entity5 today : " when sorrows come , they come not single spies , " but in battalions			2

@entity5 's future is far from predictable after @entity1 's departure , an analyst says
armed units from the @entity1 family and the @entity63 family remain at odds
the tens of thousands of @entity86 demonstrators are likely to play a role
a combination of factors probably led @entity1 to finally step down
