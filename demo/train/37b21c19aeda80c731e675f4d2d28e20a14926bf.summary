@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity5 prepares to add a new category to its arsenal of portable devices with tablets , the company 's mobile team is deploying ways to better tie its different systems together			1
it might not come as a surprise that the internet giant is using the @entity15 to do that			0
like smartphones , this new breed of tablets will run @entity20 , an operating system developed by @entity5			1
this next version of @entity20 , called 3.0 or @entity22 , is its first designed for tablets but will also run on smartphones			1
like @entity26 does with its closed system , @entity22 will let users buy applications on computers and synchronize them between their @entity5 gadgets			1
using the @entity33 website in a browser , you can browse , buy and download apps , @entity5 announced at a news conference on the company 's main campus here on wednesday			1
from the website , users can beam the app to any number of phones or tablets connected to their accounts			1
the phone begins downloading the app almost instantly			2
this feature has already been enabled automatically on @entity20 phones			0
previously , you 'd have to open the @entity20 app on a smartphone in order to search for and download programs			0
synchronizing between other family members ' phones , for example , was a hassle			0
in @entity26 's controlled habitat , the @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 share information and apps via a central hub in the @entity67 software			1
" there are no wires , no syncing to computers , none of that kind of nonsense , " @entity69 , @entity20 's engineering director for cloud services , said onstage at the @entity20 event			2
" everything just works seamlessly , syncing between the two			0
" the announcement reinforces @entity5 's philosophy of doing everything over the internet , or " cloud " in industry parlance			1
@entity20 already synchronizes personal information such as e-mail and contact lists through the @entity15			0
" it 's the cloud that makes the experience seamless , " said @entity89 , who leads @entity20 development			2
but the synchronization features will mean little if @entity5 ca n't persuade smartphone customers to purchase upcoming @entity20 tablets			1
so much of wednesday 's event was focused on a walkthrough of new features that will be available to these devices			1
a new app called music brings the @entity20 system closer in line with @entity26 's @entity61 - @entity63 model			2
albums and songs are organized in a screen with a heavy emphasis on cover artwork			0
@entity22 also has a live video chat function that will let tablet users talk with other people who are using @entity112 on a computer			2
@entity26 's portable devices with @entity115 can talk only to @entity117 computers running a beta program or using @entity120 's app. @entity120 does not offer a video - calling app for @entity20			2
the new @entity20 software includes improved multitasking functionality , so you can see a window of what apps you were previously using looked like when you closed out of them			2
all of this runs thanks to a combination of hardware - acceleration techniques for smooth animations			0
these techniques also help drive more powerful games			0
@entity5 's partners showed a game called " @entity137 , " which is based on a game originally developed for the @entity139			1
developers said they did n't need to make major alterations to get it to work on the tablet			0
they also showed an action - packed , medieval - themed game that taps into the hardware 's multicore processors			0
@entity5 also attempted to woo attendees and people watching the event 's online video stream with a slew of new apps designed specifically for tablets			1
@entity2 announced onstage it will offer an @entity20 app with @entity157 functions and live video capabilities			0
the tablets also will be able to run all of @entity20 's 130,000 apps designed for smartphone - sized screens			1
the apps will fill the tablets ' larger screens			1
" we 've spent a significant amount of effort making sure that existing @entity20 apps run well on tablets , " @entity166 , @entity20 's director of product management , said onstage			1
the first tablet to launch with the new version of @entity20 is @entity175 's @entity174 , which debuts this month			1
an exact release date and pricing have not been set			0
a @entity22 tablet from @entity180 , called the @entity181 , will come out in march , @entity178 announced tuesday evening			0
in addition to a camera on the front used for video chatting , that device has a pair of cameras on the back for capturing high - definition @entity191 photos and video			0
you 'll need 3 - d glasses in order to see the video on the tablet 's screen			2
@entity178 and @entity200 also announced more information on new @entity20 phones this week , none of which will run the @entity22 software at first .			0

apps can be beamed to your tablets or smartphones from that site
