-- @entity1 returned to inspire @entity2 to another record - breaking @entity4 display against @entity5			1
real had only won once in 25 previous trips to @entity7 but the @entity9 aces buried their @entity11 hoodoo with a magnificently marauding 6 - 1 victory on wednesday			1
@entity1 , back to pull the strings in midfield after a three - match domestic ban , @entity16 and @entity17 all scored twice in a dazzling display			1
the result meant @entity2 set a new record -- scoring in 32 consecutive @entity4 matches			1
@entity1 , who has scored 36 goals in 33 games , is now also this season 's leading scorer in the @entity26 's elite cup competition with 11 goals			1
the @entity29 captain became only the third player to pass 60 goals in the @entity4 , and is now five behind @entity32 's 66 -- with former @entity2 and @entity5 star @entity33 leading the way on 71			2
his first at the @entity35 was vintage @entity1 ; he bamboozled the @entity5 defense with some fancy footwork before firing the ball into the net			2
his second in the 89th minute was n't bad either as he rounded the keeper before similarly blasting the ball home			0
" the team has played a lot of good games and this is one more , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" we played well and did n't allow @entity5 to play at their best			0
we are happy and a step away from the next round			0
" the @entity5 goalkeeper did very well and made good saves , but i believe in my ability and my teammates helped me a lot			0
" @entity57 striker @entity56 had the last say on the pitch as he sent a zinging shot into the top corner as a late consolation for the home side			0
the goals were not quite so free - flowing in @entity64 , where @entity66 boss @entity65 pitted his wits against @entity69 's @entity68			1
just two days after @entity65 criticized his attackers in a leaked private conversation , he watched his team settle for a 1 - 1 draw against the @entity75 champions			1
@entity76 , chosen to spearhead @entity66 's strike force ahead of @entity78 , put the @entity80 leaders ahead after just eight minutes when he strolled in @entity82 's clever pass from a counter-attack			2
after a rocky first half , @entity69 made a tactical switch and @entity68 recovered their poise , pressing forward to urgent whistles from their vociferous fans			2
former @entity66 player @entity89 , facing his old teammates for the first time since his 2012 exit , helped drive the equalizer with his muscular presence			2
but it was defender @entity96 who tapped in @entity98 's corner to level the match for the @entity75 champions after 64 minutes			0
" in the first half we were too deep and played with fear , " @entity69 told broadcaster @entity100			0
" but i 'm happy with the second half and 1 - 1 is a good result			1
" @entity68 had a goal disallowed in bizarre circumstances in the first half when two balls were in play at the same time			0
the @entity75 side scored from a hastily taken throw - in but @entity66 captain @entity113 was still holding the original match ball			1
@entity65 may have more puzzling conundrums to ponder after the first leg of the last - 16 tie			1
with @entity68 's defense worryingly exposed in the first half , @entity66 missed a golden chance to go home with an away victory in the bag			1
" in the first half the game was our game , " @entity65 told @entity100			0
" i am not criticizing our strikers but in the first half we had many chances to do the second goal			0
" i ca n't complain ; the players were fantastic			0
the result is not amazing and the second leg will be difficult , we have to try to go through			0
" the decisive return leg will be played on march 18 .			1

@entity2 *punish* @entity132 with a brilliant 6 - 1 display
@entity1 , @entity17 and @entity16 all score twice
@entity66 settle for 1 - 1 draw against @entity68 in @entity64
