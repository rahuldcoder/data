-- @entity1 likes a good workout			1
and she is getting one after a bunch of angry women turned her into a punching bag			0
the 32 - year - old @entity8 fitness enthusiast is under attack for posing for a cheeky photo and posting it on @entity12			1
the picture shows @entity14 -- who works out for 30 to 60 minutes per day , six days a week -- dressed in a workout bra and shorts that reveal an extremely toned body			1
she 's surrounded by her three young sons -- now 1 , 3 and 4			2
@entity21 overhead is a simple but loaded question : " what 's your excuse ? " the photo went viral			2
it has more than 16 million views on @entity12 and more than 12,000 comments			0
most of the reaction has been positive ; @entity14 estimates that the negative comments are outnumbered by the positive ones by a ratio of 7 - to - 1			1
and it was meant to be			0
but a lot of women out there were absolutely furious with @entity14			1
" you , as a woman , should be ashamed that you are furthering the downward spiral of how society views women , and how we women view ourselves , " scolded one blogger			0
some call her obnoxious , a showoff , a bully shaming other women and worse			2
what 's worse ? how about getting accused of being a " bad mother " ? that 's right			0
some women had the nerve to insist that no one gets into this kind of shape without neglecting their children			0
oh , do n't go there			2
the last thing we need is another skirmish in the " mommy wars " where women compete to see whose maternal instincts are stronger			0
" i did it because i knew it would wake people up , " @entity14 told me in an interview while her sons clamored for their mom 's attention in the background			1
" my intention was to inspire and motivate people to get healthy			2
" her point : if a mom with three children can work out , eat healthy and stay fit , what excuse is there for the rest of us ? " it takes a lot of time to raise kids , but you have to also make time to take care of yourself , " she said			1
that is n't easy with @entity14 's schedule			1
she said she cares for her three boys without a nanny in addition to creating and running a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people get fit			2
she wants @entity100 to lead a healthier lifestyle			1
she saw her mother -- whom she describes as a 52 - year - old saddled with the body of a 70 - year - old -- battle diabetes in her 20s , a stroke in her 30s , and a heart attack and kidney transplant in her 40s			0
her mom 's health problems got @entity1 's attention , and the daughter -- who admits to being a chocolate lover and " sugarholic " -- aims to set a different example for her children			1
@entity14 said she saw a column i 'd written for @entity0 recently about so - called " fat letters " -- missives that schools send home to parents informing them their children are overweight			1
i thought the letters were a bad idea			0
" parents play such an important role in teaching their kids to be active , to eat good food and stay fit , " she said			1
" the " fat letters " got my attention for several reasons			0
as the father of two young girls , i worry that someday other girls -- what @entity144 has dubbed " @entity146 " -- will lash out at them for their physical appearance			0
as someone who is attacked by the left and the right , i worry that @entity100 have forgotten how to talk to one another without treating every annoyance or disagreement like a seek - and - destroy mission			1
and as someone who is in a profession that is supposed to be about defending the little guy , i worry that bullying has become the new normal and that everyone is so eager to play the victim that they miss the irony when they start victimizing others			0
all these worries come together in the exasperating and yet empowering story of @entity1			1
it appears that the young mother was coming from a good place and that she was n't out to pick on anyone			1
@entity14 believes she is being a good mother , and she 's not backing down			1
i asked her what this experience has taught her			0
for one thing , she said , she had no idea that mothers could be so competitive about mothering			0
she recalls the woman who wrote her an angry letter trying to one - up her , asking if she had ever started a business , gotten a ph.d. or learned another language			0
" there are a lot of people who do n't take responsibility , who make excuses , who like to blame others , " she said			0
she 's right about that			0
after the government shutdown , a lot of @entity100 are talking about how @entity195 is broken			2
but do you know what could really stand some repair ? how @entity100 talk to each other , especially when they disagree			1
our public dialogue has gotten personal and ugly			2
maybe it 's the anonymity afforded by @entity204 and other sites , where people can rip into one another in hurtful ways without revealing their identities			0
or maybe it 's just more evidence of what has been , over the last few decades , a gradual coarsening of the culture			0
whatever caused it , this much we know : many @entity100 have forgotten their grandma 's admonition that if they ca n't say anything nice about someone , they should n't say anything at all			1
in the case of @entity14 , her critics should have said nothing at all			1
@entity224 at @entity12 / @entity225			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity1 has been criticized for posting photo of herself in bra and shorts with her sons
@entity228 : @entity14 makes a good point about being healthy and staying fit
he says @entity100 need to talk to each other instead of getting personal and ugly
@entity228 : @entity14 is n't guilty of being a bully , but some of her critics are
