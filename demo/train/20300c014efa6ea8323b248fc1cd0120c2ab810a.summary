-- @entity2 's announcement that @entity4 employees who work remotely must come in the office or quit has raised howls of criticism			1
her supporters defend her decision by pointing out that many @entity4 workers who work at home never came in and hid from management , and that her decree is a wake - up call to get focused on teamwork and innovation so that the company can get up to speed			1
@entity20 's reasoning makes some sense			0
but mandating face time will not automatically lead to creativity and collaboration			1
the key is establishing a culture of innovation and aligning talent and performance			0
@entity30 should not have to axed in the process			0
a work - at - home mom defends @entity4 's @entity20 @entity4 happens to be a case of an out - of - control , work - at - home company			1
it 's telework gone horribly wrong			1
@entity30 , in itself , does not hurt productivity			2
but telework , when implemented poorly , can be a problem			2
telework is just one out of many management tools designed to make a company more attractive for hardworking employees			1
working from home does n't necessarily hurt productivity			2
if management takes the time to implement it effectively and link it to accountability , then telework benefits both the company and employees			1
it can build trust and promote healthy work - life balance among employees			1
however , management must have the courage to get rid of deadwood and fire telework abusers			0
employees commit to an organization because they buy into company goals and feel valued , not because they are ordered to sit at their desks			1
@entity4 may have long - term trust and morale issues if it continues this policy			1
abolishing telework is like canceling the prom because some immature people spiked the punch bowl			0
it is not going to get @entity4 out of its doldrums			2
it may result in exodus , as talents leave for employers who do not see work - life flexibility at war with job performance			0
opinion : ceo is right : @entity4 workers must show up @entity20 's calling all remote workers into the office raises some unspoken prevailing cultural assumptions			1
workers who have control over where , when and how they work are often perceived as less productive			0
giving workers flexibility to integrate personal life with work is viewed as antithetical to boosting performance			0
yet studies have shown that all workers value control over personal and work time			2
this is not just a mom 's child care issue or a dad 's elderly care issue			0
it is a people issue			0
from millennials to gen @entity112 to boomers , men to women , returning veterans to disabled employees -- having flextime and telework can make a huge difference in people 's lives as they juggle work and life			1
adapting to new ways of working is a competitive advantage in today 's working environment			0
organizations should realize that not everyone works best in the same way			0
some people can handle text messages from work , family , news and @entity131 24/7			0
others work better at 5 a.m. or late at night			0
and then there are people who desperately need time to focus and detach from work to get creative			2
policy riles workers everywhere productivity does not equal face time			1
what remote workers should do is set clear performance goals and regular times for meetings and calls with core teams			0
telework can build loyalty since employees can better manage their family life -- something that everyone can appreciate			2
and sometimes , they end up working more hours that they do n't clock in			0
so when should a company draw a line on working remotely or in the office ? when management is no longer sure who works for them or how to coordinate a team , and employees always place their own interests over the company			1
@entity4 needs to ask employees how to improve productivity and creativity without having to sacrifice telework			1
given that it 's harder than ever nowadays to separate the boundary between work from life , does @entity4 really think that requiring that employees to work in the office is the right solution ? let 's hope @entity20 's decision is temporary			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity4 ceo @entity2 told employees that they must work in the office or quit
@entity179 : mandating face time will not automatically lead to creativity , productivity
she says @entity4 happens to be a case of telework gone horribly wrong
@entity179 : if a company implements telework in the right way , everyone benefits
