@entity0 -- it 's been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the @entity6 economy , causing markets to plunge , unemployment to spike , housing values to crumble and placing more @entity6 in financial peril than at any time since the @entity12			1
on monday , president @entity13 touted his administration 's successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work			1
@entity13 said government 's response " put a floor under the fall " and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again			1
the president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus , creation of seven million jobs , the resurgence of the bailed out @entity37 automakers , higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports			1
" we 've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we 've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity , " @entity13 said			1
although @entity13 paints a rosy scenario , there are still key questions on the economy			1
@entity52 , a leading name to become the next chairman of the @entity55 , withdrew his name from consideration on sunday , clearing the way for @entity59 , who serves as vice chairwoman at the @entity55 , to become the leading candidate			2
also , the @entity62 announced last week that top economic adviser , @entity64 , will step down as head of the @entity66 and be replaced by @entity67 , the acting director of the @entity68			1
there is also the looming showdown with @entity71 on funding the government , raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills , and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in @entity0 to reduce the deficit			1
there is also the potential impact of the @entity84 , the sweeping health care law backed by @entity13 that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with @entity88			2
it 's the economy , stupid that motto was made famous by political strategist @entity91 during @entity93 's 1992 presidential campaign , and rang true for @entity13 's first presidential campaign as well			1
and the @entity6 public agrees			2
in poll after poll , fixing the economy is a stubborn no. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about			1
a @entity1 / @entity104 poll conducted this month indicates that 41 % of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now , with health care at 16 % and the crisis in @entity110 at 15 %			1
soon after taking office , @entity13 signed a massive economic stimulus bill , led the charge for @entity115 reform and accelerated the bailout of the @entity6 auto industry , which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it			1
some began to compare @entity13 to president @entity121 , who transformed the fabric of @entity6 society in the face of the depression with aggressive government intervention			2
' poor marks ' but since his first two years in office , some experts say , the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy			1
liberal economist @entity132 has been highly critical of his record			2
" i give him very poor marks			2
five years later , the economy is still very far from recovering , " said @entity132 , co-founder of the @entity136 , pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9 % instead of 7.3 % if so many people had n't given up and dropped out of the work force			1
and it shows in @entity13 's approval ratings			2
through much of last year , he had a 30 % approval rating on the economy			1
that number is up this year -- to 43 % -- but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue			0
a screeching halt in 2010 , many conservatives , led by the tea party movement , sought to stop the president 's agenda			0
they voted out the @entity154 majority in the @entity155 and replaced them with conservative @entity88			0
then , those @entity88 did what they were sent to @entity0 to do			0
the president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010			1
instead , he 's been jumping from one political crisis to the next			1
fights over federal budget and spending levels locked @entity71 in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government			0
the narrative did n't always fall in @entity13 's favor ; nor did the policies that ensued			0
republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction			1
the president jumped on the deficit - reduction bandwagon and made that a priority			1
through protracted political battles over the size of the government , forced spending cuts , which sliced up to 10 % of most of the federal budget , went into effect			0
it was n't the president 's favorite idea , however , for how to revive the economy			1
he still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills			0
so did his supporters , who grew frustrated with the president			0
" we 're getting tired			0
... the unemployment is unconscionable			0
we do n't know what the ( president 's ) strategy is , " rep. @entity196 , @entity197 , said in 2012			0
but in the frame of deficit reduction , @entity13 was able to obtain a few concessions			1
he won a series of tax increases , including an increase on the top tax earners : those making more than $ 400,000 per year			0
the budget cuts , tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $ 4 trillion over 10 years , according to the @entity62			1
the nation 's debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade , which economists hail as good for the economy			1
the foreign affairs president while the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda , overseas conflict has kept his plate full			0
he expanded the war in @entity230 and ended the war in @entity232			1
he kept his attention on the citizen - led revolts that swept the @entity237 world and expanded the use of drones			1
under his administration , @entity241 leader @entity240 was killed and the @entity6 joined a @entity244 campaign to overthrow @entity246 dictator @entity245 , and @entity13 is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in @entity110 's civil war			1
although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time , world events have created challenges for @entity13 's ability to implement his domestic agenda			0
" when you look at issues like military strikes in @entity110 ... it takes the full time and attention of the leaders , " @entity257 of the @entity258 said recently			1
as the president decided to hold off on a military strike in @entity110 while secretary of state @entity269 works with his counterpart in @entity271 to devise a plan to rid the regime of its chemical weapons , the president attempted to revitalize discussion of his domestic agenda			0
" even as we have been spending a lot of time on the @entity110 issue ... it is still important to recognize that we 've got a lot more stuff to do here in this government , " @entity13 said during a meeting with his @entity278 on thursday			1
economist @entity288 said that , all things considered , the president has been fairly successful on the domestic front			0
" it has been a tough road , but i think he did a pretty good job , " said @entity288 , chief economist at @entity292			0
but economist @entity132 offered a more critical perspective , saying the president has n't shown a willingness to push an economic agenda			2
" let 's say @entity110 did n't happen			0
what would he be doing right now ? i am not sure he has some agenda that is being obstructed by events in the world , " he said			0
@entity110 aside , much of the @entity62 's attention this fall will be spent on getting @entity6 to sign up for the health insurance exchanges , the heart of the @entity84			1
open enrollment begins october 1 , and the administration is expected to spend $ 8.7 million on a media blitz to promote the exchanges			0
@entity314 champs to promote @entity84 second term , second chance after his re-election , the president hoped to reset his economic agenda			2
in his 2013 @entity320 , @entity13 said he will work to " reignite the true engine of @entity6 's economic growth : a rising , thriving middle class			2
" this summer , he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy			2
in a series of speeches this year , he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery , including income inequality and employment disparities			1
@entity6 ' real median household income fell from $ 63,000 to $ 55,600 between 2000 and 2011 , and as of december , 9.1 million jobs were necessary to restore the job market to pre-recession levels , according to the @entity338			0
" reversing these trends has to be @entity0 's highest priority			0
it has to be @entity0 's highest priority			0
it 's certainly my highest priority , " @entity13 said in @entity342 , @entity343 , in july			0
job creation , affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals			0
those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy , creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education			0
but what has the president done since that july speech ? some say , not much			0
" nothing has happened on any front , " economist @entity288 said			0
@entity62 press secretary @entity362 pushed back , arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities			1
" the president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class , " @entity362 said wednesday			2
as new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom , the president confronted the issue monday			2
" i can '' t remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it does n't get 100 % of what it wants , " the president said , blaming the @entity88 for potential " massive economic turmoil			2
" with ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling , @entity288 said immigration reform , which would be a major catalyst for economic growth , appears to be heading nowhere in the @entity62			1
and tax and entitlement reform , which would also help to stimulate the economy , have no chance of happening this year			2
there 's always next year			0
but 2014 is an election year , which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation			0
after that , the president is in his final two years of office , and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the @entity404			0
then , by definition , it can be hard for a lame duck president to get much done			0
@entity1 's @entity408 , @entity409 and @entity410 contributed to this report .			2

other issues take attention away from economic struggle
@entity417 , threats of shutdowns , fears of starting war have been *obstacles*
still , the deficit has been reduced , and the economy is improving
