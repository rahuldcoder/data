-- @entity2 ' @entity1 has gotten a makeover			1
for the character 's big - screen debut in @entity8 's " @entity7 v @entity6 : @entity6 , " the familiar red , blue and gold costume has been traded in for a bronzed ensemble with matching thigh - high boots			2
the new look was unveiled at @entity14 on saturday , with director snyder sharing the first photo of actress @entity17 as the @entity19 princess			1
some fans have been thrilled , saying @entity1 's costume was due for an update			1
" not the classic costume , but interesting , " one observer noted on @entity24			1
" that looks like @entity1 to me ! " tweeted another			2
" other fans have been vocally disappointed , dismissing the costume as too " @entity31 : warrior princess " and the actress as too petite to portray the fierce fighter @entity34			0
" not impressed , " said one commenter on @entity2 ' facebook page			0
" colors are too muted			0
nothing about this says @entity1			2
" " where is the powerful , strong @entity1 we all love ? " asked another fan on @entity24			1

" @entity44 , who played @entity1 on tv in the ' 70s , has n't voiced her opinion on the new costume -- but she did ask her fans to weigh in			1

her co-star @entity53 had the lion 's share when he was brought on to play @entity7			0
