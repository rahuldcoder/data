-- some people have a difficult time deciding what to give during the holiday season			0
for me , it could n't be easier			0
that 's not only because shopping for my husband , @entity7 , is so easy -- he 's quite happy to receive books or jigsaw puzzles every year			0
it 's also because there is a simple way that anyone can give a meaningful gift this time of year			0
and it 's happening tuesday			0
just as there 's @entity19 and cyber monday for finding great shopping deals , there 's now # @entity22 for anyone who is feeling grateful this time of year and wants to share a bit of their good fortune with those in need			0
one of the best ways we 've found to do that is to contribute to the @entity34 's @entity33 campaign			0
for just a few dollars , you can provide life - saving vaccines to children in the poorest countries			1
living in the @entity41 , most of us take vaccines for granted			1
we get them when we 're children , and when we grow up to be parents , the pediatrician tells us when our child should get the next one			1
but that is n't the case in many parts of the world , where millions of children still are n't getting immunized against life - threatening diseases			1
@entity7 and i believe that vaccines are one of the real miracles of modern medicine			1
over the last 50 years , they have saved more lives than any other medical innovation			1
vaccines have nearly eliminated polio , and significantly reduced the incidence of life - threatening diseases such as measles , pneumonia and severe diarrhea			1
with vaccines , children have a much better chance of growing up healthy and becoming productive members of their community			1
without vaccines , children are vulnerable to many deadly and disabling diseases			1
today , more than 80 % of children around the world receive a complete course of life - saving vaccines during their first year of life			1
yet one in every five children -- mostly in the world 's poorest communities -- do n't get this level of protection			1
as a result , an estimated 1.5 million children under age 5 die each year from vaccine - preventable diseases			2
thankfully , there are committed , compassionate people working to close this gap			0
since 2000 , one of our largest global health partners , @entity96 , the @entity97 , has enabled 440 million children in developing countries to receive life - saving immunizations			2
this effort has saved the lives of 6 million children			1
at the community level , women in particular play a major role in helping children get the vaccines they need			1
in @entity110 and @entity111 , female health care workers risk their lives to get polio vaccines to children in areas of conflict			1
and mothers are most often the ones keeping track of their children 's health records and making sure they get vaccinated			2
and there 's another group -- people like you -- who can also make an important difference			0
often , people say they do n't believe they can really have an impact on big , global issues			2
the truth is , they can			0
in the 15 years that i 've been doing this work , i 've seen time and again that when lots of individuals take action it adds up to a movement that can achieve impact for women and children on a grand scale			1
and when it comes to vaccines , it 's easy to have a real and lasting impact right now			2
for just a $ 5 contribution to @entity33 , you can protect a young girl from polio and measles for her entire lifetime			0
for $ 15 , you can protect a boy from the two most deadly diseases -- pneumonia and severe diarrhea			0
the more you 're able to give , the more children you can help protect			2
and on # @entity161 , the @entity160 is sponsoring a " one day sale			0
" we will match any donation you make to @entity33 , so your gift will go even further			0
no matter how much you decide to donate , giving a child a shot at a healthy life is one of the most meaningful gifts you can give this holiday season			0
when you help one child grow up healthy , you 're helping an entire family			2
and healthy , thriving families help entire communities create a better world for all of us			0
a small gift can make a big difference .			2
