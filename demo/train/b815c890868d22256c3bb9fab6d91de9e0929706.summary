@entity0 -- take a look at the more diverse slate of potential 2016 @entity5 presidential contenders and one thing becomes quite clear : this is not your daddy 's @entity7 -- at the top anyway			1
there are @entity13 sens. @entity11 of @entity14 and @entity15 of @entity16			0
there is an @entity19 @entity18 : gov. @entity20 of @entity21			0
and joining @entity20 , @entity11 and @entity15 from the @entity23 ranks are gov. @entity24 and rep. @entity25 , both of @entity27			0
boomers potentially in the mix include @entity31 sen. @entity30 , sen. @entity32 of @entity16 and gov. @entity33 of @entity34			0
three out of the past four @entity5 nominees were all well into their 60s , while the @entity38 over the same period went with younger candidates			1
now look : @entity38 are taking a page from @entity41 , the oldest president ever on @entity42 at 69			1
@entity43 would be that age on @entity45 2016 , if she runs and wins , while vice president @entity46 might be considered historically " young " for a senator at 73 at the same point , but breaking new ground for the @entity50			2
both are quite pale , too , and so is most of " the bench " of the party that embraced history in 2008 and nominated the first @entity18 for president in @entity56 , who was at the time merely in his 40s			2
@entity7 race for 2016 is wide open " democrats are known as having great policies ( for minorities ) on paper , but it 's harder to rise through the ranks , " said @entity60 , an associate professor of political science at @entity62			1
" the republicans do n't have great policies on paper , but they are often more supportive of their minority candidates			2
" @entity56 's election meant that many of the @entity38 old guard , folks like @entity75 and @entity46 , had to bide their time and wait until the next cycle			1
but his time around people like @entity83 gov. @entity82 are barely a consideration , she said			0
" if you want to present something different , young , charismatic black guy is n't it , " @entity60 said			2
the @entity5 was blasted during the 2012 presidential election as the party of old , white , men for their presidential and congressional candidate lineups			1
the @entity7 lost among young people , minorities and women in large numbers and was forced to do some serious soul searching in preparation for the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections			1
@entity7 problem : ' their voters are white , aging and dying off ' but even as the @entity5 was taking a beating over its lack of diversity and tin ear on issues important to minorities , a class of young guns who more closely resembled the broader @entity18 electorate made headlines for their edgier brand of conservatism			1
" these candidates have been very shrewd and extremely media savvy and have been able to garner a lot of attention very quickly , " @entity60 said			0
" it 's partly their own skill and being in the right place at the right time			0
but it 's also the @entity5 not wanting to look like the party of old white men			2
" as a tea party darling , @entity11 has earned nods from conservative corners for his criticism of @entity134 , but is also seen as a more moderate voice in the debate over immigration reform			0
@entity15 and @entity32 rode that same anti-establishment , tea party wave into @entity141 and have since garnered attention for their fiery rhetoric about the ills of big government and willingness to challenge the status quo			2
@entity33 rose to prominence because of his swaggering conservative style tempered by his willingness to reach across the aisle in his state			0
he made a splash , too , by giving @entity56 and his administration credit on @entity157 recovery efforts			0
meanwhile , @entity30 , @entity25 , @entity20 and @entity24 's clear and direct conservative approach to fiscal and governance matters is seen in right wing circles as a refreshing change from what some in the @entity5 have felt is a watered down version			0
" the fact that the @entity38 do n't have the depth of diverse talent like the @entity5 do might be an indication that , despite what they might have you believe , their party is old and stale , " said @entity164 , the @entity165 communications director for black media			1
@entity165 highlights strategy for building ' new generation of black @entity5 ' the slate of potential 2016 @entity7 presidential hopefulsâ € ” and to be clear , no one on either side of the aisle has officially announced a bidâ € ” may be younger and more diverse			1
but the broader party is still too old , too white and too out of touch with the rest of @entity185 , said @entity186 , a veteran @entity7 strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980			1
" i think our party is stone deaf on the issue of @entity192 and immigration			0
we 're turning off not only @entity192 , but also women , young people and @entity196 with stupid , intensive comments , " @entity186 said			0
he pointed to anti-immigration comments by recent @entity5 candidates and former @entity202 gov. @entity201 's comments about @entity38 thinking women " ca n't control their libidos " as " equally stupid			1
" " @entity7 candidates who cater to the extreme right in the primaries , do n't realize the long term damage they 're doing to the @entity5 brand in terms of alienating the segment of voters who are growing the fastest , " @entity186 said			1
" this damage will be hard to overcome in the general election			0

in the 2016 election , the @entity7 could present a more diverse cadre of presidential hopefuls
by contrast , the *presumed* @entity38 likely *frontrunners* are older and white
@entity7 *focused* on diversity after it lost big among minorities in 2012
though their candidates are diverse , the party still has work to do in minority voter *outreach*
