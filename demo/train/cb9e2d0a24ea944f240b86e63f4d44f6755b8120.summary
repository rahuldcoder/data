-- a smoky fire broke out aboard an empty @entity2 in @entity3 on monday in the latest glitch for the much - heralded @entity6 model			1
the @entity2 plane , which had arrived at @entity8 from @entity9 at 10 a.m. , was being prepared for a noon departure at a gate when a maintenance worker noticed smoke and called emergency crews			1
" upon arrival , we observed a heavy smoke condition in the entire cabin , " said @entity15 , chief of the @entity16			1
" we found a fire condition about midship in the avionics compartment underneath			2
we advanced an aggressive , offensive fire attack			2
" batteries used to start the auxiliary power unit , which provides electricity for ground operations , are located in the small area in the belly of the plane			1
" we did have a flare - up			0
there was a small explosion -- one of the batteries -- and we again went in with a secondary attack and were again able to knock it down , " @entity15 said			0
@entity2 confirmed the cause of the fire in a news release			1
it said 172 passengers and 11 crew members had been on the plane			1
everyone had disembarked when the fire was discovered , the airline said			0
one firefighter had a skin irritation from the material used to put the fire out , but no one else was injured			0
@entity15 says it 's not likely this could have happened during flight when the auxiliary power unit was not in use			1
" this is an extremely serious situation , " @entity58 , a former pilot and vice president with the @entity60 , told @entity0			0
" if there is any problem i think you will see something come out very shortly			0
" monday 's incident is not the first mechanical problem for the 787 series , which was delivered to airlines starting in 2011 after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns			1
the @entity73 plane was delivered in december			0
in 2010 , fire caused a 787 test flight to lose primary electrical power while flying from @entity77 , @entity78 , to @entity79 , @entity80			1
it landed safely using backup systems and the 42 people aboard evacuated using emergency slides			1
an engine failed during tests on the ground in @entity88 in july 2012 and inspectors found a similar problem on another aircraft in september			1
in december , another relatively new 787 operated by @entity92 diverted safely to @entity93 after experiencing mechanical problems			1
" the 787 , being a new airplane , does have teething problems , " @entity95 , a former member of the @entity96 , told @entity0			1
@entity95 , a former airline mechanic , said it is common for new planes to have " these kinds of problems			0
" while serious , @entity58 did not think these issues are a sign of larger concerns with the 787 program			2
" there does not appear to be a common thread in the problems the planes have seen , " he told @entity0			0
" if they had another situation , a fire , that was in that same locality you 'd start to say yes , we 've got something else that is going on			0
" @entity6 said it was investigating the incident and noted it was too early to draw any parallels			2
" we need to give our technical teams time to really understand the event , " @entity117 , spokeswoman for the 787 program , said in a statement			2
" anything offered now would be speculation and likely incorrect			0
it 's just too early to make comparisons to other events or to draw conclusions			2
" the @entity96 sent a team to investigate the incident			0
" it 's one of our ' most wanted list ' issues , fire in transportation , " @entity130 , a board spokesman , said			0
@entity0 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
