-- regulators are focusing on at least four of @entity3 's biggest banks as they investigate the attempted manipulation of the region 's benchmark interest rate , suspecting that @entity8 ' traders were the ringleaders of a circle that included @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
evidence of links between traders at all four banks and @entity8 ' former euroswaps trader @entity18 is under scrutiny , people involved in the process have told the @entity22			1
the news comes in the wake of the clear - out of senior management at @entity8 , after the bank paid a £ 290m fine to settle probes in the @entity29 and @entity30 into its involvement in the attempted manipulation of the @entity35 interbank offered rate ( @entity36 ) and its @entity3 equivalent , @entity38			1
the furore over the attempts to rig lending benchmarks has led to calls from policy makers around the world for an overhaul of the system that underpins $ 500tn of contracts globally -- everything from arcane derivatives to standard home loans			0
in its settlement with @entity8 , the @entity53 , the @entity29 futures regulator , described an unnamed trader as having " orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks [ ... ] in order to profit from their futures trading positions "			1
according to several people familiar with the matter that senior @entity8 trader was mr @entity18 , who worked for @entity8 from 2005 until 2007			2
his strategy was based on the fixing of three - month swaps pegged to @entity38 -- the euro - based interbank lending rate set in @entity72 by averaging 44 banks ' submissions , regulators have said			1
according to an @entity22 investigation , mr @entity18 is alleged to have contacted a number of traders whom he knew at other banks , either through previous employment or via professional or personal networks			0
regulators are looking at suspected communication with @entity83 at @entity10 , @entity84 at @entity11 and @entity85 at @entity12 , all of whom no longer work at the groups in question , according to people familiar with the investigations			1
at @entity13 the identity of the traders in question remains unclear and the probe appears to be at an earlier stage			2
there were at least 20 requests from traders at rival banks to @entity8 ' euribor submitters to lower or raise rates between 2006 and 2008 , according to findings by the @entity104 in its settlement with @entity8			2
it has been clear for some time that about 20 institutions have been drawn into regulators ' sights over the affair			2
but until now , the details of how individual banks could be implicated has remained murky			0
there had been a broad assumption that most banks under investigation were suspected of manipulating @entity36 submissions in the financial crisis period running from 2007 - 9 to appear healthier than they really were , sometimes allegedly with the implicit nod from policy makers			2
however , the alleged involvement of traders at @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , predates the financial crisis by several years			1
@entity8 ' settlement with regulators made it clear that there were two distinct periods of attempted manipulation -- the first for trading gain , the second for broader reasons of financial stability			1
sir @entity136 , @entity137 governor , has sent a letter to other top central bankers inviting them to a september 9 meeting in @entity141 to discuss " radical reforms " to the @entity36 process			0
the invitees include the head of the @entity146 , the @entity147 and other major central banks , according to a person familiar with the contents			0
but to date there has been no allegation of wrongdoing made by any authorities against any of the individuals or any bank beyond @entity8			0
all the banks declined to comment beyond previous statements confirming their co-operation with regulators over the broader investigation			0
the traders concerned either could not be reached or declined to comment			0
reporting by @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
