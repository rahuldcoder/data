attorney general @entity0 is not entirely ruling out a scenario under which a drone strike would be ordered against @entity3 on @entity3 soil , but says it has never been done previously and he could only see it being considered in an extraordinary circumstance			1
he began to winnow the list of those possible extraordinary circumstances wednesday			0
in testimony wednesday before the @entity10 , sen. @entity8 , @entity9 , pressed @entity0 whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an @entity3 terror suspect " sitting at a cafe " if the suspect did n't pose an imminent threat			1
" no , " @entity0 replied			1
but he also said the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the @entity3			2
echoing what he said in a letter to @entity3 sen. @entity22 , @entity23 , he called the possibility of domestic drone strikes " entirely hypothetical			1
" that letter , released tuesday , was prompted by questions raised over the nomination of @entity29 to head the @entity30			1
specifically , members of the @entity32 sought the @entity35 administration 's legal rationale for its use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas			2
but sen. @entity22 , a @entity41 @entity40 who has said he would do what he could to hold up @entity29 's nomination until he got a full answer to his query , wanted to know whether the administration considered that policy applicable domestically			1
@entity0 : drone strike against @entity3 in the @entity3 possible in a letter to @entity22 dated on monday , @entity0 said it was possible , " i suppose , " to imagine an " extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate " under @entity3 law for the president to authorize the military to " use lethal force " within the @entity3			1
however , @entity0 said the question was " entirely hypothetical " and " unlikely to occur			1
" the @entity3 , he said , has not carried out such action domestically and had no plans to do so			0
@entity0 said a potential scenario might involve a president ordering such action " to protect the homeland " in a case like the 2001 @entity65 attacks on @entity66 and @entity67 or the @entity69 bombing of @entity70 in 1941			1
but he said the administration rejects the use of military force where law enforcement authorities provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat			0
@entity22 , who released the letter from @entity0 along with his statement , was not satisfied with the response			1
" the @entity3 attorney general 's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on @entity3 citizens and on @entity3 soil is more than frightening			1
it is an affront to the constitutional due process rights of all @entity3 , " @entity22 said			0
@entity88 , @entity89 senior legal analyst , said on @entity89 's " @entity90 " that @entity0 made it clear in his letter that he would have to examine the facts of each situation separately and advise the president on his legal authority			1
" again , he made a point of saying sen. @entity22 's question is hypothetical at this time			2
but at some point down the road , this may not be hypothetical , " @entity88 said			0
@entity29 defended the use of drones overseas at his confirmation hearing weeks ago , but acknowledged there should be more public discussion			2
read letter from @entity29 to @entity22 in a written response to the intelligence panel , @entity29 , too , said the administration has " no intention " of killing @entity3 with drones in the @entity3			2
the issue of targeting @entity3 terror suspects with lethal force was brought into sharp focus in 2011 when @entity119 - born @entity118 was killed in a drone strike in @entity121			1
officials said he played an operational role in @entity124			0
@entity29 confirmed a connection at his hearing between @entity118 and @entity127 , who tried to blow up a @entity129 jet enroute to @entity130 in 2009 with a bomb in his underwear			2
the @entity35 administration has said targeting @entity3 overseas with drones is only permitted when the @entity3 government determines a suspect to be an imminent threat to the @entity3 and when capture would not be feasible			0
additionally , all applicable laws must apply			0
the @entity141 's @entity140 turned over new documents on its legal rationale to the @entity10 intelligence panel earlier in the day			2
some key members who had been pressing for the information said they were satisfied with the @entity148 cooperation			0
" we are pleased that we now have the access that we have long sought and need to conduct the vigilant oversight with which the committee has been charged			0
we believe that this sets an important precedent for applying our @entity3 system of checks and balances to the challenges of 21st century warfare			0
we look forward to reviewing and discussing these documents in the days ahead , " democrats @entity159 of @entity161 and @entity162 of @entity163 , and @entity164 , a @entity165 @entity40 , said in a statement			0
they credited @entity22 with raising the use of drones domestically as a question of " fundamental importance			0
" the @entity32 approved @entity29 's nomination later tuesday and sent it to the full @entity10 for consideration			1
@entity148 to give senators targeted killing documents			0
