-- president @entity1 pressed ahead saturday with a pledge to sanction @entity3 and support its rebels by speaking with @entity6 leaders by conference call about @entity9 ' chemical warfare			1
@entity1 's talk with the leaders of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 came before next week 's @entity17 summit in @entity18			1
the five leaders discussed " ways to support a political transition to end the conflict " in @entity3 , the @entity19 said			2
@entity12 prime minister @entity24 told @entity0 that during the video conference , @entity1 said further intervention into @entity3 " should be done on our own timeline			1
" " we have already taken some decisions in that @entity12 is helping to give technical assistance , training , advice , help , shaping , to the @entity3 opposition , and we do that along with the @entity35 , @entity13 and others and will continue to do that , and we will take time to make these decisions with our allies , " @entity24 said			1
one @entity17 member , @entity42 , was not part of the call saturday			1
@entity42 foreign minister @entity45 said any attempt to enforce a no - fly zone over @entity3 using @entity49 fighter jets and @entity51 missiles from @entity52 would violate international law , according to @entity42 state broadcaster @entity54			1
@entity42 television reported that @entity45 's comment followed speculation in the media that a no - fly zone could be imposed through the deployment of the missile systems and fighter jets sent by the @entity35 to global military drills in @entity52			1
also saturday , @entity68 president @entity67 announced that he has cut diplomatic ties with @entity9 , the state - run @entity65 newspaper reported			1
" we have decided to close down the @entity3 embassy in @entity74 , " @entity67 told a conference in support of the @entity3 opposition at a @entity74 stadium			1
" the @entity68 envoy in @entity9 will also be withdrawn			2
" @entity67 told @entity0 in january that he supported calls by people in @entity3 for president @entity80 to be tried for war crimes			2
meanwhile , @entity83 spokeswoman @entity82 dismissed media accounts friday about @entity1 having decided on establishing a no - fly zone			1
those reports are incorrect , she said			0
@entity35 deputy national security adviser @entity87 also addressed the matter friday when he was asked how difficult it would be to establish a no - fly zone			1
" in @entity3 , when you have the situation where regime forces are intermingled with opposition forces , they 're fighting in some instances block by block in cities			2
that 's not a problem you can solve from the air , " he said			0
@entity104 secretary - general ban ki - moon called again for an on - the - ground investigation into the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 and asked @entity9 to grant a @entity104 team long - sought access			1
" the validity of any information on the alleged use of chemical weapons can not be ensured without convincing evidence of the chain of custody , " he told reporters in @entity111			0
the @entity42 foreign minister also expressed doubts saturday that the @entity3 regime used chemical weapons against the opposition			1
@entity45 said that @entity35 military aid to the @entity3 rebels may lead to an escalation of violence in the country , according to @entity42 news agency @entity129			1
the @entity1 administration has not detailed what military support it plans to give the rebels , but @entity134 officials have told @entity0 that support includes arms , ammunition and , possibly , anti-tank weapons			2
what concerns many about supplying arms to the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al @entity144 sympathies , the same stripe of militants @entity35 has battled in @entity147 and @entity148			1
they include the @entity149 , a rebel group with ties to @entity144			1
friction within @entity144 ? there were signs saturday of a schism in @entity144 's top leadership over control of @entity149			2
@entity157 , head of @entity144 in @entity147 , may have defied an order from the terror organization 's leader , @entity159 , to stop trying to claim control of @entity149			1
that 's according to an audio recording purportedly from @entity163 that was posted on jihadist websites and by the @entity165 on saturday			0
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the recording			0
in the recording , @entity157 said @entity144 in @entity147 and the @entity149 will operate as one , under the title " the @entity171			1
" the @entity172 is a term that dates back to the 1500s			0
it was once used to describe the region that today consists of @entity3 , @entity177 , @entity52 , @entity178 and parts of @entity147			2
the recording follows a statement released this month by @entity159 that said @entity144 in @entity147 and @entity149 will operate as separate entities with separate leadership			2
it 's unclear what @entity163 's statement means for @entity149 's operation in @entity3			1
meanwhile , rebel and government forces once again clashed at hotspots around @entity3 on saturday , with the opposition @entity192 reporting 79 dead			1
twenty - four of those deaths were in and around @entity9 , 17 were in @entity195 province and 12 were in @entity196			2
the rebel army has suffered a number of setbacks in recent weeks that in large part have coincided with the arrival of thousands of @entity203 fighters , backed by @entity177 and @entity204 , to reinforce @entity80 's forces			0
after months of gaining ground , the rebels this month lost @entity208 -- one of its strongholds near the @entity177 border -- that was considered essential for its supply route			0
@entity3 forces and @entity203 fighters have now turned their focus on retaking @entity195			0
black flag over mosque draws scrutiny on friday , @entity203 leader @entity219 criticized @entity222 networks @entity220 and @entity223 for their portrayal of @entity203 's involvement in the takeover of the strategically important border city of @entity229 , @entity3			2
when @entity208 fell , a video surfaced online showing @entity203 fighters raising their black banner over a mosque in @entity229			0
a sectarian dispute has arisen over whether the mosque was @entity235 or @entity203			0
@entity203 is the powerful @entity177 @entity203 militia backed by @entity204 and the @entity3 government			0
in a friday speech , @entity219 defended fellow fighters			0
" yes , there were some young men in @entity208 who , yes , i have to admit -- and there is a room to discuss whether this was right or wrong -- the young men may have gotten too excited and overwhelmed by the events when they climbed to the top of a mosque and raised a black flag that had the writing of @entity249 on it , " @entity219 said			0
" the video was then posted online and @entity222 tv networks like @entity220 , and @entity223 grabbed the video and distorted the facts by saying that @entity203 fighters raised the flag on a @entity235 mosque under the pretext that they want their audience to know more			0
know what ? they are feeding their audience lies , distortions , fabrications , " @entity219 said			0
shortly after @entity219 's speech , @entity177 's @entity264 reported that " five rockets fired from the @entity3 side of the borders landed in @entity269 in the @entity271 area that were later followed by four other rockets injuring two @entity177 citizens			0
" the @entity271 area is predominantly @entity203			0
earlier , the @entity274 reported that @entity3 rebels in @entity195 fired five rockets at @entity277 in @entity278 , which is mostly inhabited by @entity279 , and the rebels said in a statement that the shelling on the @entity203 village was a response to @entity219 's speech			0
the human rights group could n't say whether the rockets landed in the town or whether there were any casualties			0
@entity0 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .			0
