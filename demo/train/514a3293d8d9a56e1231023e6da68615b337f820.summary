-- the national controversy over a surge of @entity4 immigrants illegally crossing the @entity6 border established a new battleground this week in a small @entity9 town , where angry crowds stopped detained migrants from entering their community			1
the sentiment carried over to a raucous wednesday night meeting at a @entity16 high school auditorium			1
border patrol and immigration officials got an earful			2
" this is an invasion , " attendee @entity20 said before a full house			2
" @entity23 is n't the @entity24 stopping them from coming in ? " the overflow crowd of hundreds spilled out into the school 's parking lot			2
in a faceoff tuesday with three buses carrying the migrants behind screened - off windows , demonstrators chanted " go back home ! " and " @entity6 , " and successfully forced the coaches to leave @entity16			1
the buses instead took the 140 or so undocumented immigrants to @entity6 processing centers at least 80 miles away , in the @entity41 and @entity42 areas , federal officials say			1
counterprotesters squared off with the demonstrators , and a shouting match erupted over the nation 's immigration system , which recently has been overwhelmed with a tide of @entity4 minors illegally entering the @entity6 alone or with other children			1
local politicians appear to be in lockstep with their constituents			0
" it 's a nationwide problem , and little ol ' @entity16 has taken the lead , " said mayor @entity54			1
@entity59 supervisor @entity58 got a rise out of the crowd , asking them to hold the @entity63 accountable			0
" @entity64 to stop using these refugees to satisfy a political agenda , " he said			0
root of the problem a mix of poverty , violence and smugglers ' false promises is prompting the @entity4 inflow			1
unlike undocumented @entity76 migrants , who are often immediately deported , the @entity4 are detained and processed by the @entity6 government , and eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices			1
many never show up and join the nation 's 11 million undocumented residents , says the @entity81 , the union representing @entity83 agents			2
the @entity85 immigrants rejected by @entity16 protesters were initially held in @entity87 , where @entity6 facilities are so overflowing that detainees are sent to other states for processing			1
the government does n't have the room to shelter the children with adults : there 's only one family immigration detention center , in @entity98			0
to assist the unaccompanied children , president @entity100 's administration opened shelters last month on three military bases , because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors			0
tuesday 's busloads of detained @entity4 immigrants did n't include any unaccompanied minors , said @entity16 police chief @entity109 , who put the number of protesters at 125			1
the children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults , said an official with the @entity81			0
' deport ! deport ! ' the protesters -- who shouted " @entity119 ! " and " deport ! deport ! " -- confronted the buses a day after the town posted a notice on its website : " @entity124			2
" " this is a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level , " @entity54 said in a statement monday about the pending arrival of the 140 immigrants at the @entity6 @entity83 station			1
" @entity16 continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local border patrol office			1
" @entity54 spoke to @entity0 's " @entity135 " later wednesday			0
" it 's not against the immigrants , " he said			2
" they 're trying to leave a less desirable place and come to the greatest nation in the world			0
we ca n't blame them for that			0
... no one 's protesting that			0
what we 're protesting is the product of a broken system that finally reached the doorstep of our community			0
" @entity54 said that neither side in the national debate is coming up with a solution : " the problem still is there			2
the problem is in @entity157 " the @entity6 government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to @entity16 for processing on friday , a union official for @entity83 agents said			1
@entity109 also said he was told to expect 140 immigrants every 72 hours , with the next group scheduled to arrive on friday , the @entity166			1
earlier wednesday , immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters			1
" it is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children , " @entity169 , a community representative of the @entity170 , said in a statement			1
" even more concerning is that elected officials in the @entity180 of @entity16 instigated this tension			1
mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma			0
" intense debate the furor in @entity16 illustrated the conflict between protecting the borders and ensuring the safety of detained immigrants and children			1
protester @entity191 said the country 's identity has eroded with an influx of undocumented immigrants			1
" i just wish @entity85 would be @entity85 again because it 's not , and it 's not just pointed to the @entity196 , " @entity191 said			0
" everybody needs to go through the legal ways			0
" other protesters told @entity0 affiliate @entity200 they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the @entity6			2
" everybody that wants to come to this nation is entitled to , but they should come the right way , " @entity203 told the news outlet			0
" you bring in all these children and they 're going to take over our schools , " @entity210 added			0
" what 's going to happen to the kids that were born and raised here ? " but immigration rights advocate @entity218 likened the migration to a refugee crisis and suggested racial antipathy was motivating protesters			1
" if these children were from @entity226 , we would not be having this interview , " @entity218 said			0
" the parents have had enough			0
they are saying , ' if i do n't send my child north , they are going to die			0
' " the @entity6 government is struggling to detain and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants , particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from the @entity4 countries of @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239			1
the @entity6 government does n't have enough beds , food or sanitary facilities			0
authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the @entity63 has called an " immediate humanitarian crisis			0
" last month , the @entity64 administration unveiled a plan to spend almost $ 100 million in aid to @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity237 to help reintegrate the undocumented migrants whom the @entity6 will deport , and to help keep them in their home countries			2
the administration also will set aside $ 161.5 million this year for the @entity256 programs in an effort to " help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration , " the @entity63 said			0
the @entity64 administration has accused syndicates in @entity85 of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation about relocating to the @entity6 that has caused people in poor @entity4 countries and @entity76 to risk their lives to cross the @entity6 border illegally			2
@entity64 to take executive action on immigration @entity270 : undocumented and hiding in plain sight crossroads of hope and fear : stories from a desert bus station @entity0 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 contributed to this report .			2
