-- last sunday , a group of us sat on the beach , watching the children play , when the talk turned , as it often does , to @entity6			1
" the @entity6 said the loveliest thing yesterday			1
my father in @entity12 called me to tell me about it , " my @entity9 friend @entity8 told us			2
my @entity15 friend @entity14 chimed in with another charming anecdote , and everyone remarked how warm and affectionate @entity6 is			1
i was pleased to hear all the comments , but not surprised , since it 's been like that all year			2
everyone is talking about him , all the time			1
in this first year of his papacy , @entity6 has stirred up hearts and minds , not only among his flock , but also among a wider culture that is generally inhospitable , if not downright antagonistic , to the teachings of the @entity29			1
he has sparked admiration and consternation , and most of all , he has inspired wide - flung interest and debate			0
it seems the voice of the vicar of @entity38 , even in this secularist age , has tremendous carrying power			0
people who long ago dismissed the church as a hidebound , irrelevant institution seem to be irresistibly drawn to the captivating @entity6			1
i was stunned , recently , to have a very liberal acquaintance of mine , who happens to be @entity46 , tell me we finally have a progressive pope			1
a priest reflects on @entity6 ' first year he used the word " we			1
" to my acquaintance , " progressive " is high praise , as it describes a belief in the growing wisdom of mankind and the inevitable improvement of our culture , resulting in welcome human flourishing			2
it was clear to him that both he and @entity6 share the same desire , to see all people living more joyful , fulfilling lives			1
my friend 's comment illustrated the peculiar power of @entity6 : that of presenting the central message of the church -- that @entity71 loves every man and woman passionately and desires their good -- in ways that those quite outside the influence of the church can recognize and warm to			1
pope @entity6 has been at pains to explain what he is about , which he characterizes as a new chapter of evangelization for the church			1
his task is to find ways , and help the rest of the church find ways , to transmit the joy which so obviously fills him and sustains him			0
he calls it the joy of the gospel , which perhaps might be explained as the joy of knowing that we are truly loved , although all of us are completely undeserving of that kind of sacrificial devotion			0
he is the first one to declare himself a sinner , and undeserving , with an utterly disarming humility			0
he writes , in @entity97 , " i dream of ... a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything , so that the @entity29 's customs ... can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today 's world rather than for her self - preservation			1
" this is quite a statement			0
it seems he understands that too many @entity29 today find themselves with a bunker mentality , hoping to " get by " without calling too much attention to themselves			1
they feel beleaguered by those who no longer have the philosophical and religious education that would enable them to understand social doctrine , especially sexual , as anything other than stuffy nonsense that has outlived its usefulness			0
the church has found itself , understandably , in a defensive posture			0
it has been greatly exacerbated recently by a new tendency in modern culture to decry an adherence to age - old , universal attitudes toward marriage and sexuality as intolerance and bigotry			0
but that defensive posture , @entity6 seems to say , is not courageous and outward - looking , and not worthy of those who have been charged with the sacred mission of spreading the good news			2
of course , there are many who hope that he will repudiate some of those social teachings , and thereby change the character of the church itself			0
again and again he is asked why he does n't emphasize those difficult matters , like abortion and marriage			0
he did n't mention them in @entity9 , during @entity142			0
he explained then : " the @entity29 has already expressed herself perfectly on this			2
... it was n't necessary to talk about that , but about the positive things that open the way to youngsters			0
" when pressed for his personal position , he answered with direct and perfect simplicity : " that of the @entity29			2
i am a child of the @entity29 ! " @entity6 wants @entity29 , bravely , out of their bunkers			1
he is telling them that there is tremendous power in the knowledge that believers carry within them			0
the joy of the gospel , as @entity6 sees it , is capable of setting us free from sorrow , loneliness and inner emptiness			2
are n't those exactly the torments that plague modern people , satiated with material goods like never before but atomized and radically alone ? it would be criminal for @entity29 to hide it away because they are fearful of criticism or just lazy and unmotivated			1
the @entity6 tells us to put joy into action , in service to the poor , love of the sick , going out to meet our brothers and sisters at the crossroads and bringing them home			2
he personally and infectiously shows us exactly how it 's done			0
join us on @entity183 / @entity182			0
