nearly two years ago , @entity0 worked hard to convince the @entity1 that he was no believer in torture -- and that if he was confirmed as @entity5 director , he would n't represent a return to @entity8 - era tactics			1
he told senators at the time that he 'd read the @entity11 's summary of its investigation into those " enhanced interrogation techniques " and that it had " raised serious questions " in his mind about whether those techniques had been effective			0

then , though , he said he read the @entity11 's report			0
" i must tell you , " he said , " that reading this report from the committee raises serious questions about the information that i was given at the time , and the impression that i had at the time			0
now i have to determine , based on that information , as well as what @entity5 says , what the truth is			2
and at this point ... i do not know what the truth is			0
" he added : " there clearly were a number of things , many things , that i read in that report that were very concerning and disturbing to me , and ones that i would want to look into immediately , if i were to be confirmed as @entity5 director			0
