-- the interesting news in the latest @entity0 / @entity3 poll that @entity4 is pulling a 66 % favorable rating among @entity6 suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt @entity9 as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months			1
the question is : which has he been doing more of lately ? the poll was a reminder that @entity6 tend to be more forgiving of their presidents over time , no matter how long they served , which party they hailed from or how voters may have felt about a commander in chief at the moment he stepped down			0
@entity22 ( 54 % ) , @entity23 ( 59 % ) and @entity4 , who have been out of office between 31 and 11 years , all earned personal approval ratings north of 50 % ; only @entity26 , who stepped down three years ago , is below 50 %			1
but even his rating has improved since he returned to private life			0
being an ex-president is almost always good for your approval rating			0
photos : secrets of the @entity34 , from @entity35 to @entity9 the @entity0 poll appears at the moment when @entity4 has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage , and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering			1
some have read in his comments about @entity47 ( he called his business record " sterling " ) a desire to undercut @entity9 or set the table for a run by his wife , @entity53 , in 2016			2
this analysis gained momentum when @entity4 told @entity56 that economics demanded that the @entity26 tax cuts should be extended temporarily			2
that comment led @entity4 to apologize			2
but the evidence does n't really support a campaign of sabotage			0
a simpler explanation for @entity4 's capering -- and one that better fits @entity4 's record -- is that he is a permanent political consultant			1
and his " candidate " is n't paying close attention to his advice			0
@entity4 is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future			2
fighting about who did what in the 1980s , @entity4 thinks , is a sure loser			2
better to focus on who has the better plan going forward			0
( remember the chorus of his campaign song ? " do n't stop thinking about tomorrow			0
" ) so he has taken his approach to the airwaves			0
it is easy to forget that @entity4 has differed with the @entity85 in the past about how to frame a political race			1
in 2010 , working through vice president @entity88 , he urged @entity9 to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of @entity6 in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record			1
but the @entity85 resisted this approach , fearing the stimulus and health care reform were not popular enough to brag about and instead tried to make the @entity101 agenda the issue			2
@entity4 disagreed but ( mostly ) kept his mouth shut about it			0
he does n't seem willing to bite his tongue now			0
photos : @entity4 's last days in office @entity4 is n't the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended			1
so great was his dislike of @entity111 that @entity35 could n't stay out of the 1952 race and even campaigned against @entity111 that fall			0
@entity114 made life unpleasant for @entity116 in the 1976 @entity101 primary ( and seemed determined to undercut @entity26 in 1992 , to @entity4 's benefit )			1
but @entity4 's grudge is n't personal ; it 's about how best to mount and run a campaign			1
how much of his personal popularity @entity4 will spend to win this argument is unclear , but nearing age 66 , as the new poll shows , the former president has time to earn it back .			1

@entity4 is riding high in the *opinion* polls , with a 66 % favorability rating
@entity131 says it 's a sign that former presidents ' popularity increases after @entity85
he says some have suggested @entity4 's comments have been an effort to undermine @entity9
@entity131 : @entity4 is more likely acting as a campaign consultant , urging point of view on @entity9
