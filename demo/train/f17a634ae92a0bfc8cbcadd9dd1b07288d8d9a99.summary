@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home , now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings			1
a plastic flower arrangement still hangs on an exterior wall that did n't collapse in the earthquake			1
one wooden bathroom cabinet survived			1
standing amid the rubble , @entity3 , 23 , recalls that horrific day : she had just returned home from her job as a secretary at @entity0 's @entity20 radio station and was preparing to take a bath when the earth started rumbling			1
she rushed out in time , stood with her mother and watched showers of concrete			2
when the ground became still , she went back in to search for her father			2
a block had fallen on him			2
after she buried him , after she found a small plot of land outside a local school to set up temporary shelter , @entity3 thought about what she might do to mend her broken soul , her broken nation			2
she put on her salvaged @entity38 uniform -- a tan cotton blouse and skirt and a green scarf twisted around her neck			2
@entity3 , like many of @entity1 's almost 10,000 @entity44 , decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort			1
" it 's important to have @entity1 involved in the recovery , " said @entity47 , the scout leader in @entity0			1
" we want to help			2
" full coverage of @entity1 earthquake since the fall of the @entity56 dictatorship in the 1980s , @entity1 has created many civil society organizations and groups , but none has been particularly strong in the midst of political and economic turmoil , said @entity62 , the country director for the humanitarian agency @entity63 , which has worked in @entity1 since 1954			1
it was vital to involve grass - roots groups in the earthquake recovery process , she said , because local people are the ones who have the biggest stake in the future			1
the scouts have one other advantage : they are young			1
" it is important to involve young people right from the start , " @entity75 said			1
" they can learn values of solidarity and good governance			2
" but as determined as @entity84 is to help , this particular community chore is hardly easy for her @entity38 troop			2
in @entity87 , a village near @entity0 , about 30 miles west of @entity89 , the @entity44 lined up to distribute essential hygiene items trucked in by @entity63			1
@entity3 and her friends broke out in a song about being together ; it was the only way to get through life 's tribulations			1
she smiled and laughed with the others			0
and yet not one among them had been unscathed by the terrible tragedy that befell @entity1 on january 12			1
many had lost a family member or a home			1
by day , few are in school			0
by night , they sleep under the stars			0
no one 's lives are the way they were anymore			1
the missing , the found , the victims @entity3 handed out red , green and blue buckets filled with soap , toothpaste , towels			0
she tore open the plastic - on - foam mattresses and blankets to hand out to the needy			0
she tried not to think about her own loss at that moment			0
" it was @entity121 " that her father died , she had said earlier			0
" i will do my very best to help others because that is what i have been trained to do , " she said about her five years in the @entity44			0
" up until now , i have n't really had the opportunity to help others			0
" @entity3 passed along one @entity63 bucket after another			1
she did not cry like she did when the earth shook			0
or worry that her education was in peril			0
she had wanted to attend university , study communications			0
but it was her father who made a living as a mason			0
who will pay her tuition now ? who will support her 5 - year - old nephew ? his unemployed parents depended on her for a few extra dollars			0
she often feels scared these days when she is alone			0
" i love the way we work together , " she said of the @entity44			0
so on this blazing afternoon , amid the despair of the needy , she simply took comfort .			0

many of @entity1 's @entity150 contribute to earthquake relief
" it is important to involve young people right from the start , " @entity63 *official* says
scouts help even though they have lost homes , family members
