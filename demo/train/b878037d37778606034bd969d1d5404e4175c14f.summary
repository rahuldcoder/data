@entity0 , @entity1 -- the center - left coalition headed by @entity4 appears to have won a narrow victory in elections for @entity1 's lower house of parliament , according to final figures released by the @entity10			1
@entity4 's coalition won 29.54 % of the vote cast for the lower house , less than half a percentage point more than the center - right coalition headed by controversial three - time prime minister @entity16 , which garnered 29.18 % of the vote			1
final results for the @entity20 showed the center - left winning with 31.63 % of the vote , compared with the center - right 's 30.72 %			1
can the @entity24 pull @entity1 out of the mire ? " it 's by no means done , but it is exceptional			1
this is the first time ever that @entity1 has had a hung parliament , " said @entity29 , a professor at @entity30 , before the final results			2
" the center - left was not able to put forward a clear picture ; they lack leadership			1
and @entity16 , who was trailing way behind before @entity39 , ended up putting together , reconstituting , a new center - right coalition , " he said			1
voter turnout was lower than anticipated on sunday , the first day of balloting , down from 62.55 % in 2008 to 55.17 % this year , the state - run @entity42 news agency reported			1
weather , in part , appeared to cause the lower voter turnout , the news agency said			1
it was snowing in portions of northern @entity1 and raining in the southern part of the country			2
the candidates and their alliances sampling polls were banned within two weeks of the elections , but the most recent ones had @entity4 holding on to a slender lead over @entity16			0
former comedian @entity59 was a distant third			0
all the candidates , with the exception of @entity59 , cast their ballots sunday , @entity42 reported			0
@entity1 's political system encourages the forming of alliances			2
@entity59 : clown prince of @entity1 politics for example , the @entity68 has teamed with the more left - wing @entity70			2
the center - left alliance is dominated by the @entity68 , led by @entity4			1
@entity4 , 61 , comes across as " bluff and homespun , and that 's part of his appeal -- or not , depending on your point of view , " said @entity29 , the analyst			2
he described @entity4 , a former communist , as a " revised apparatchik , " saying the reform - minded socialist was paradoxically " far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right			2
" at second place in the polls was the center - right alliance led by @entity16 's @entity88 , or @entity89 , in coalition with the right - wing , anti-immigration @entity91			1
@entity16 has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership , indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won , but contradicting that on other occasions			0
the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed " @entity16 " has been campaigning as a @entity100 court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction , for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year			0
the verdict will be delivered after the elections ; however , under the @entity1 legal system , he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court			0
because the case dates to july 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire this year , meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time			0
why are elections taking place now ? @entity1 parliamentarians are elected for five - year terms , with the current one due to end in april			0
but in december , the @entity89 withdrew its support of the reformist government led by @entity122 , saying it was pursuing policies that " were too @entity124 - centric			0
" @entity122 subsequently resigned , and the parliament was dissolved			0
