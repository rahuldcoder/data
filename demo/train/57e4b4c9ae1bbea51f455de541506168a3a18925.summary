@entity0 and @entity1 find themselves fighting it out for @entity6 's @entity5 award once again -- but the contest between the world 's two highest - profile footballers is n't only being played out on the pitch			1
@entity13 's @entity12 international goalkeeper @entity11 was the other player on the three - man shortlist revealed monday , with @entity1 the overwhelming favorite to take the award			1
which means there is no sign of @entity22 's @entity0 and @entity21 poster boy @entity1 's domination of the back pages ending any time soon			1
both are so globally known that that their every @entity27 posting is worth thousands of dollars for brands associated with the two players , while the allure of their names helps shift any and every product with which they are associated			2
but who is the most marketable ? is it @entity0 , the newly - crowned all - time @entity36 top scorer ? or is it @entity1 , the current @entity5 holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will , no matter what the competition ? sports marketing research company @entity43 examined 15 different markets , ranging from @entity45 to the @entity46 , and found that @entity47 skipper @entity1 is the better - known of the two : 92 % know of him , while 87 % have heard of @entity0			1
the figures also show that the same number of men know about @entity0 as women know about @entity1 -- 91 %			2
they reveal that @entity1 sells more effectively , with 86 % of those questioned regarding the @entity57 @entity56 man as " an influential brand spokesman			0
" " @entity1 dominates in terms of his overall marketability -- largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world , whilst @entity0 has a greater proportion of people that do know of him saying they like him , " said @entity61 's global head of research @entity59			1
that , @entity61 says , makes the @entity21 star the most marketable footballer in the world			0
one leading academic believes @entity1 's increasingly growing " brand " off the pitch is testament to the way his management team have " packaged him as a formal business proposition " in contrast to @entity0			1
" there is a clear and deliberate strategic intent on the part of the @entity1 and his business representatives , " @entity83 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity86 's @entity85 , told @entity87			2
" the intention has been to create and position a brand that provides consumers with a differential advantage over its rivals			0
" we 've seen the development of the @entity1 brand , which @entity1 has used as the basis for the development of his commercial activities			0
" whereas @entity0 was always viewed by many as the ultimate team player , there has also been a shift in the way @entity1 is now presented to his audience , says @entity83			2
" from a man who has historically been perceived as being self - centered and arrogant , recently @entity1 's image has softened as the result of him paying for the medical treatment of a sick fan -- a young child			1
" remember too that @entity1 had his hair cut in a particular way to mark his relationship with the boy			0
those actions have helped in shaping and fashioning the latest incarnation of the @entity1 brand			0
" the data also shows that @entity1 's online clout is higher than @entity0 's			1
the @entity21 forward boasts more than 102 million @entity27 followers , with @entity43 calculating his average @entity27 post value in 2014 to be worth $ 143,750			1
@entity0 , on the other hand , has 75 million @entity27 fans and average post value of $ 62,500			1
are we likely to see @entity0 being marketed in a different way in the coming years ? " i 'm not convinced that @entity0 or his advisors want this , " said @entity83			0
" i think he 's simply happy to play football and pick up some additional commercial income along the way			0
" the academic argues there are complications in trying to come up with a compelling " brand proposition " for the @entity142 star			0
" five years years ago his brand was something akin to childlike innocence , someone who plays football for the joy of it			0
but now he has a child he is , therefore , not a child any more			0
" and his tax case means that the brand may be perceived as not being innocent any more			0
" one way for him to position the @entity0 ' brand ' might be as a ' family man ' ; but given that he is not married , this may not play out well among some market segments			0
meanwhile , back in the footballing arena , the statistics are more reassuring for @entity0 -- even more so given he is two years younger than the 29 - year - old @entity1			1
the @entity162 talisman is @entity36 's goals record - holder , with 253 strikes to his name , while @entity1 has 197			2
he is also the leading scorer in the @entity166 , with 74 goals -- a record held jointly with @entity169 and only one ahead of @entity1 's tally of 71			2
and @entity0 also has the greatest number of @entity5 awards -- four -- with his @entity21 rival having taken the accolade twice			2
@entity1 is @entity47 's leading all - time goalscorer with 52 , while @entity0 and @entity175 share the record of most goals scored in a year for @entity178 , each striking 12 times			1
@entity0 has hit 44 goals in 95 games for his country overall			0
so these stars will fight it out for the @entity5 award , unless @entity11 spoils the party .			1
