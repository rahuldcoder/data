-- it was vintage @entity2 : new rumors that he might be alive			1
this time , his younger brother gave it credence			2
never mind that @entity7 said he was with his brother when he died in 1984			2
three decades later , he was now reading from a mysterious letter purportedly written by @entity2 in 1999 and standing onstage with a woman who presented herself as the comedian 's 24 - year - old daughter			1
the announcement just happened to be made at a @entity15 comedy club during the annual @entity17 show			0
because we sooooo wanted to believe it was true : the comedic genius would finally make his grand return			0
anything to keep the hope alive			2
then , @entity7 hit us with the next line : he believes he 's the victim of a hoax			1
@entity33 has already been immortalized in the @entity35 song " @entity36 " and in the @entity38 movie by the same name			1
his wrestling antics with @entity40 are forever etched into @entity43 lore from @entity33 's infamous expletive - laced tirade on " @entity45 with @entity46			1
" this week 's news got us wondering why @entity33 still fascinates			1
here are five reasons , in a reverse - order fashion he would appreciate : 5			0
the @entity51 @entity33 was @entity53 's borat two decades before " @entity52 " hit the big screen			1
he was " @entity55 " and " @entity56 " rolled into one			0
@entity33 was the internet troll before the @entity58 was created			1
" he was like that annoying house fly who wo n't leave you alone , " says @entity59 , a professor of pop culture at @entity61			0
" he was the opposite of a super villain			0
it 's not like he could freeze the world or burn the world up			2
he could just irritate the daylights out of the world			0
the @entity73 let 's face it : how much fun would it be to see @entity33 step into the ring with @entity40 one more time ? the @entity79 : the comedic genius who rocked wrestling maybe an @entity84 match			1
even @entity40 pines for that moment			0
as the rumors swirled this week of @entity33 being alive , @entity40 challenged @entity33 to hop back into the ring			1
" we would have to have a rematch , " @entity40 told @entity0			2
" we could rekindle the feud with no problem			0
milk and cookies he once took an entire audience out for milk and cookies after a show			0
love him , hate him if you 're 40 or older , you likely have some memory of @entity33			2
on the sitcom " taxi			0
for that generation , @entity43 will always remember @entity33 -- as a comedic genius , as a befuddling buffoon , as a bulging - eyed maniac			2
" what @entity2 was doing was so new and so groundbreaking , " says @entity61 's @entity59			1
" the idea that you would derive humor out of stupidity and absolute nothingness , i think , was really fascinating			0
" " he was doing a critique of the out - of - control @entity43 celebrity back when most people did n't even realize it was out of control			0
the @entity122 @entity33 always talked about faking his death -- and doing so would be keeping within character , playing a joke long past the point of annoyance			1
the nation loves practical jokes , and clinging to the possibility that @entity33 is still alive lets us feel like we 're still playing along			1
" @entity2 was often about doing an awful lot of stuff and enduring an awful lot of hatred and scorn before the punch line ever arrived , if it ever did , " @entity59 says			2
think about it : the setup comes in 1984 and the punch line gets delivered nearly 30 years later			0
" you so want it to be true because it would be one of the greatest things to ever happen in the history of comedy , " he says			0
" it would be the longest joke ever told			1

internet buzzed this week after reports that @entity2 might be alive
@entity33 's brother ultimately said he felt he was victim of hoax
people want to believe because " it would be the longest joke ever told "
