@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 stoops down to point out her favorite feature of the sidewalk : a thick , bronze ring attached to the curb , about the size of a bracelet , weathered and rusted			1
the sidewalks of downtown @entity0 , @entity1 , are lined with them at inconsistent intervals			1
they are remnants of the days when @entity16 immigrants farmed the lush countryside known as the @entity18 , she says			0
farmers of predominantly @entity21 heritage rode into town and tied their horses to the rings while they conducted business in stores like @entity27 , which still stands , and claims to be " @entity1 ' oldest hardware store in continuous operation " since 1857			1
why there 's no messing with @entity1 the rough , weathered rings are the real deal , products of @entity21 ingenuity , says @entity37 , a native of @entity0 who exudes the requisite boosterism you 'd expect from the @entity41 director , but with a genuine sense of pride			1
" when the @entity45 built stuff , they built it to last , " @entity37 said , laughing			2
many residents of this waypoint between @entity49 and @entity50 grew up speaking @entity21 in their homes and remember when the hometown paper , the @entity52 , was written entirely in @entity21			2
some are fifth generation who can trace their roots back to 1845 , when the first settlers arrived after prince @entity58 , @entity45 , founded the town on the @entity60 under a @entity21 charter			1
@entity62 : @entity60 overflowing -- with people @entity45 were originally lured to the @entity64 when it offered public land to @entity66 and @entity16 to pay off war debt and weaken political ties with @entity69			2
this offer , combined with political strife in their home country , enticed a group of @entity21 noblemen to form an immigration company , and @entity21 immigrants began arriving in 1844			2
but times have changed , and now some residents say @entity0 , sister city to @entity80 , @entity45 , is n't " @entity21 " enough			1
sure , it has a @entity21 - @entity66 society , a shooting club , polka dances and @entity85 , @entity1 ' " oldest continuously operating bakery " since 1868 , which serves fresh pfeffernüsse and streussel			1
the town also has @entity89 , an annual festival that features @entity21 food and music			2
but as the town grows , 56.4 % from 2000 to 2010 , it wants more visible evidence to let those from outside the area know what @entity0 is about : a sign that says " wilkommen , " street signs in @entity21 , building facades adorned with fachwerk , or timberframe			1
what 's behind the rise of @entity1 ? " we would like to see the town look a little more @entity21			1
this town would n't be here if it were n't started by the @entity45			1
it 's a historical fact , " said @entity110 , who grew up on a farm 15 minutes outside @entity0 in a @entity21 - speaking home			1
she cited tasteful examples such as @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 , @entity118 , known as @entity118 's " little @entity119 , " and less tasteful examples , like @entity121 , @entity122 ( " @entity121 's a little over the top , " she said )			0
" @entity49 is predominantly @entity124 , it 's their heritage , and you can see it in the streets , the buildings			0
we feel like we could play on our heritage			0
" @entity133 , the owner of the biggest @entity21 restaurant in town , @entity136 , has been asking the chamber for several years about playing up the town 's @entity21 roots			2
" people come here looking for a @entity21 town and they 're disappointed			1
people come in here and ask where can i buy lederhosen and i do n't know what to tell them			0
there 's nowhere , " said @entity133 , a tall , imposing businessman who moved to @entity1 with his wife , @entity150 , and two sons in 2004 from @entity152 , @entity45			1
he opened @entity136 in 2005			0
the restaurant serves traditional dishes as well as others like @entity1 schnitzel , made with spicy jalapeño			2
americanizing an ancient faith in @entity1 @entity37 said the chamber is responding to feedback such as @entity133 ' and is working on a larger promotional campaign to play up @entity0 ' @entity21 heritage			1
she acknowledges the impetus comes from a desire to draw businesses and tourists , but it 's also just a part of growing and sustaining the community , she said			0
" we 've always had a brochure and used our @entity21 heritage as marketing tools , but we 've discovered our @entity21 heritage is not in your face like people expect it to be , " she said			1
" our heritage is the combination of 1,500 years of @entity21 society and our frontier - immigrant roots married together			2
where is it ? we 're walking it and living it			0
but we need to show it off more			0
" case in point : @entity190 , the flagship water park that has sprouted three satellite locations since it opened in 1966			0
occupying more than 65 acres on the eastern banks of the @entity60 -- and growing -- the business is second - generation family owned and operated			0
with ride names such as @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , and a replica of the guard tower in @entity0 looming over the park , visible from blocks away , park spokesman @entity196 says kitsch is part of @entity190 's charm , but says it 's also part of paying homage to @entity0 ' @entity21 roots			1
otherwise , authentic evidence of @entity0 ' @entity21 roots is subtly tucked into curbs , stamped into building facades and embedded in its civic fabric			1
the hometown newspaper lists community events in the " @entity221 " section , which loosely translates to " table reserved for regulars			0
" the best bbq in @entity1 @entity0 also boasts several organizations dedicated to preserving its @entity21 heritage , including the @entity225 , a shooting club that traces its roots back to 1849 , and the @entity228 of @entity0 , which says it has more than 700 members			1
the group , a co-sponsor of the @entity232 , or children 's choir , organizes annual events like @entity236 ( costume ball ) and @entity238 ( @entity239 ) as well as less formal events like games of ninepin bowling and skat , a @entity21 card game			2
@entity245 , a co-founder of the society who moved to @entity0 from @entity45 in 1962 , said it grew out of a desire to bring together the disparate singing societies and social clubs under the banner of @entity21 pride			1
" @entity45 are a very proud people			2
they 're known to be hard - working , self - reliant , do n't take handouts and they believe strongly in education , " she said			0
since helping start the society in 1978 , @entity245 ' has continued to contribute to @entity21 social life in @entity0			1
she is a member of the walking club and a docent at several museums and sites dedicated to the town 's @entity21 heritage			1
one of them , the @entity267 , is one of the oldest structures in town and the place where " father of @entity1 botany " @entity272 lived and died in 1879			2
the @entity267 is within walking distance of the @entity60 , which feeds into the larger @entity276 , providing sources of leisure in the summertime			0
families walk down the streets lugging inner tubes to the nearest drop - in point , with @entity284 among the most popular			0
during the day , families park on the banks of the river under shady oak trees while children wade in the water or ride a train that meanders through the park , or visit the @entity293			0
as @entity37 walked through the park barefoot , picking up trash and spouting off facts about its origins , she waved at the conductor of the train , an elderly man named @entity302 , who she said was following in his father 's footsteps			0
@entity37 revealed that she is not @entity21 : " @entity305			0
" but she said she was grateful for what the @entity45 had done here			0
" you do n't really start thinking about it until you have children			0
but it 's like my second - grade teacher @entity311 ( of the @entity312 ) told us : it 's our responsibility to preserve and enhance our community so future generations wo n't have to leave			0
we have to tell our own story and build up our own community , or people from the outside with lots of money will come in and do it for us			0

residents say @entity0 , @entity1 , sister city to @entity80 , @entity45 , is n't " @entity21 " enough
as the town grows , it wants visitors to know what @entity0 is about
