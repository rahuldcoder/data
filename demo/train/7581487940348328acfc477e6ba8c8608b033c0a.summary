-- the @entity1 has ordered @entity3 agents to verify , " effective immediately , " that every foreign student who wants to enter the @entity5 has a valid student visa , a @entity5 government official told @entity0 on friday			1
the memo went out earlier this week as part of an effort to reform the student visa system , said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			2
the effort is meant to provide the agency with real - time updates on all relevant information , the official said			0
news of the memo follows reports that two friends of @entity25 bombing suspect @entity24 , who are now charged in connection with the attack , may have been in the country on student visas that were no longer valid			1
@entity30 and @entity31 , both 19 and from @entity32 , were charged this week on suspicion of obstruction of justice in connection with the case			0
they were already in federal custody on suspicion of violating the terms of their student visas when they were charged in the bombings case			1
the pair started at the @entity44 in 2011 , along with @entity24			0
@entity30 was not enrolled at the time of his arrest last month			0
his lawyer , @entity47 , told @entity0 his client had not been attending classes on a regular basis , as required by his visa			0
@entity31 's student status is less clear			2
according to the university , @entity31 is enrolled but was suspended pending the outcome of the current case			0
at an immigration court hearing this week , however , the court heard that @entity31 's status with the school was terminated january 3 , according to a @entity5 government official			1
the court also heard that @entity31 went to @entity32 in december 2012 and was allowed to return to the @entity5 on january 20 , despite the apparent lapse in his visa status , the same government official said			1
that news has outraged @entity5 rep. @entity66 , head of the @entity67			1
" the fact that a foreign national was able to re-enter the @entity5 with what appeared to be a valid student visa , while @entity3 officers were unaware that his visa status had become invalid , represents a serious hole in our national security , " @entity66 told @entity0			1
" the front - line cbp officers did not have access to the system that would 've informed them of a change in legal status			2
" @entity66 said it indicates " disconnects " and problems with information - sharing among @entity1 agencies			1
sen. @entity88 , ranking member of the @entity89 , said friday he also has concerns about gaps in the immigration system			0
" it 's surprising that the administration is n't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa , " @entity88 said			2
" what 's more concerning is that nearly 12 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , we have n't fixed the problems with identifying visa overstays			0
" @entity88 sent a letter and list of questions friday to homeland security secretary @entity106 , asking her about the apparent visa lapse with @entity31 and other possible loopholes			2
@entity0 's @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 contributed to this report .			0
