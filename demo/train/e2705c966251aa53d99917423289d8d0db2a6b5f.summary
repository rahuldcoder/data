-- in an incident eerily similar to a sexual assault that sent shock waves worldwide , @entity2 police say a woman was gang - raped over the weekend by seven men after she boarded a bus at night			1
police have arrested all seven suspects , including the bus driver , after the alleged friday night attack in the @entity13 district of @entity15 state			2
actress @entity16 , best known for her " @entity18 " role , talked to @entity0 's @entity19 about her own experience and what it 's going to take the change the situation forever			1
@entity0 : as a woman growing up in @entity2 , do these stories shock you ? @entity16 : growing up in @entity2 , i remember picking up the newspaper almost every day , and by the time you reach the fourth and the fifth page , there 'd be a little column in the corner that would be dedicated to a rape case that was reported			1
and the sad part is that those rape cases are just reported , and there was no follow - up after that			2
it kind of made me wonder as a girl growing up in @entity2 if forever as a girl , i would have to live in the fear of this might just happen to me			1
the challenges of being a woman in @entity2 @entity0 : what was your reaction when you found out about the rape of the 23 - year - old woman , the one that has galvanized the world ? ... were you surprised when that rape , given what you said about it being in the paper every day , when that rape was the one that inspired and motivated people ? @entity16 : in a way , actually , i was			1
what was shocking was the reaction			2
and i think it was a very appropriate and much required reaction			2
would have been wonderful if it happens many , many years ago , but the fact that it happened finally is what is really important			2
i hope these voices do n't die out , because what happens in situations like i was telling you , even growing up , just reading about them and you read them every day , and it 's sickening to read them every day , to the point that you do n't want to read it after a while			1
and i hope it does n't reach a stage as that , that you kind of let it pass			0
you want something to be done , and these voices can not be shut down anymore			0
and the youth are so powerful , so they need to continue			0
@entity0 : this has been a part of what you are and what you have been fighting for			0
professionally , you played a victim of sexual violence in two films , " @entity95 " and your breakthrough role , of course , as @entity98 in the award - winning " @entity18			0
" ... when you look at ( those films ) , is that dramatized , or is that a reflection of reality ? take action to change the world for girls @entity16 : well , denigration of women in society , in a misogynistic society , is not uncommon			1
it 's heard of , and it happens not just in @entity2 , but it happens in so many parts of the world			1
we women as actors , we portray these roles in the hope that someone will listen and want to make a change and not just a film role that was played and then forgotten or just praised for the performance of how good the film was			0
@entity0 : i know you experienced firsthand , the fear of men			0
and i know your mother did also			0
one of her first horrifying experiences was when she was traveling , and she had one of these men on a delivery bike decided to kick her in the chest for a good feel , if you please , and he sped away with a laugh on his face			0
and my mother was so petrified , so shocked , she did not know how to react at that point in time			0
so she decided to carry stones in her bag so she could attack him the next time she saw him			0
you never really think it could happen to you , right ? so you continue with your everyday life			0
it 's not about the dress you wear or the kind of clothes you wear , because how would you then explain the rape of a 4 - year - old child or a 65 - year - old woman ? you would n't be able to explain that			1
so you continue living , thinking , " i 'm going to be fine			0
" and then one fine day , you 're just marked for such brutality			0
@entity0 : now , @entity16 , we keep hearing that the young woman 's rape will spark change in @entity2 , but the two rapes that have happened since that horrific act are barbaric also , as we described			1
do you think anything will change , or will there just be a hue and an outcry , and it will essentially go back to the way it was before ? @entity16 : i love being an optimist , even in situations like this , because that 's all you can do after a while			1
as soon as you become cynical , you kind of end up living a life of extreme dread and fear as well			0
and i want to be hopeful , and so , i want to live in the hope that this change can happen			0
it 's not going to happen overnight , and we are not going to be idealists about that			1
it 's going to take time			1
but that 's why i feel we can not be once again put into a situation of forced amnesia			2
we need to keep this fight alive			2
we need to keep the protest alive			1
do the math : girls + education = ...			1
