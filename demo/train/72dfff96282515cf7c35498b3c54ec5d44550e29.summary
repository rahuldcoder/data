-- @entity1 , the gleeful and secretive band of hackers who appear to be responsible for a string of high - profile and sometimes embarrassing @entity6 attacks , said it was disbanding			0
" for the past 50 days we 've been disrupting and exposing corporations , governments , often the general population itself , and quite possibly everything in between , just because we could , " the group said saturday in a statement posted on multiple websites			1
it did not cite a reason			0
if true , the collective 's final act was the posting of what it said were internal company documents from @entity23 along with private data from other companies			2
@entity1 claimed recently to have attacked the @entity27 website , and took credit for hacking into the website of @entity32 public broadcaster @entity30 and posting a fake story saying the rapper @entity34 was still alive			1
he was killed nearly 15 years ago			0
it is unclear whether @entity1 members played a role in the @entity40 breach , where hackers broke into @entity43 ' website , compromising the accounts of over 1 million users , and the gaming company @entity46 , stealing the details of nearly 1.3 million users			2
but it posted what it claims is proprietary information from @entity43 and other @entity55 properties ' websites			1
it also claimed responsibility for bringing down the @entity60 government 's website earlier this month			1
when @entity62 police announced the arrest of a teenager suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against a number of international businesses , @entity1 downplayed down his role in the collective			0
in one post , the collective seemed to suggest that by making its attacks public , it 'll push websites to increase security			1
but it also said releasing people 's information is sometimes worth doing because it 's fun			1
analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin - off of " @entity85 , " the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistleblower site @entity91			0
but while @entity85 has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated , @entity1 seems to be random			0
for every hack like the one on @entity30 , which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about @entity91 , there 's the cracking of a porn site -- and a subsequent public list of members ' e-mail addresses and passwords .			2

the group claims to have hacked the @entity27 website , among others
it says it hacks websites to push them to increase security
but it also says it does so because it 's fun
