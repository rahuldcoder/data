-- professional sports teams are attempting at a furious rate to lure fans away from the comfort of their couches to live games			0
and sweet technological upgrades to their home venues become a bigger selling point every year			0
roughly a dozen @entity11 clubs followed that strategy by making tech - centric improvements to their ballparks in advance of the 2011 season , which kicks off thursday			1
notable upgrades include ballpark - wide @entity19 access ( @entity20 ) and @entity22 high - definition ribbon boards ( @entity23 )			1
here 's a deeper look at nine other teams that have made similar significant upgrades			2
@entity27 -- @entity28 the @entity27 join the @entity29 and @entity30 as the only @entity11 teams to feature a scoreboard with a 1080i display format			1
" fans are watching games on high - definition [ television ] , so when they come out to the ballpark we want things to be in high - definition , as well , " @entity42 , the @entity27 ' senior director of creative services , told @entity44			0
where once stood a 26 - by - 45 - foot scoreboard in right field , there 's now a 54 - by - 124 - foot @entity50 behemoth that ranks as the fourth - largest scoreboard in the majors			1
the 2.66 - million pixel scoreboard was part of a $ 13 million project which included a 24 - by - 40 - foot video board stationed in left field and 1,185 linear feet of ribbon boards spanning from one foul pole to the other			1
a state - of - the - art , two - level control room comprising 1,500 square feet was built at the suite level in left field to manage the new ' boards			1
apps , gear and beer : the @entity71 to the @entity72 @entity73 -- @entity74 a 10 - year , $ 285 million plan to modify 99 - year - old @entity74 concluded this off - season with $ 40 million in construction upgrades , the most prominent of which are three new scoreboards beyond right - center field			1
@entity81 teamed with @entity82 to install three video screens : a 38 - by - 100 - foot scoreboard in right - center field that replaces a 23 - by - 30 - foot structure installed in 1976 ( but the famous @entity88 sign will still tower over the new ' board ) , a 17 - by - 100 - foot video screen in center field , and a 16 - by - 30 - foot video board in right field			1
the primary scoreboard has the ability to display side graphics , as the old scoreboard did , or move to full - screen video to capture live action			0
the side ' boards will incorporate game info such as player stats , pitch speed and type , box scores , promotions , announcements and other types of messages @entity111 -- @entity112 @entity111 fans will get to watch live game action on a new 76 - by - 97 - foot led high - def scoreboard in left field			1
the old scoreboard , which was installed for @entity118 's 2004 debut , has been relocated to the @entity111 ' spring training facility in @entity120 , @entity121			0
the team partnered with @entity50 and @entity123 on the new 84,000 - square - foot ' board , whose 2.9 million pixels dwarfs the former scoreboard 's 459,000 - pixel display			1
fans get to view one of the clearest scoreboards in the world			0
its hd - 15 display and 1,512 lines of resolution surpass that of the standard for 1080p hd video boards , and its led technology allows it to show up to 144 quadrillion shades of color			0
@entity112 's in - house video departments were also improved from standard to hd , including the video - coaching facility			1
@entity146 , the @entity111 ' director of broadcasting and video services , told @entity44 the upgrade will most benefit the scouting and self - analysis performed by the team 's coaches and players			1
" they voiced a concern to upgrade , " @entity146 said , " and our management heard that concern			0
" @entity159 @entity160 -- @entity161 the ability for fans to view information at high speed on their mobile devices headlines the pair of tech changes at the @entity160 ' @entity161			1
the incorporation of a multi-tent cell - tower system with approximately 120 antennas will permit fans to access apps like @entity11 's latest at @entity174 on @entity175 or 4g networks through their iphones , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity182 devices			1
the app allows fans to view pitch - by - pitch tracking , real - time box scores and stats and searchable video highlights through a multitude of mobile service carriers , including ballpark sponsor @entity191			0
@entity160 it director @entity193 told @entity44 that roughly 1,500 to 3,000 fans demand high - speed mobile access at any given moment in the stadium , which seats more than 42,000 fans			1
" we 're trying to get the fans more stats , videos , replays and information to their smart devices , " keys said			0
sixty luxury suites have also been outfitted with 46 - inch @entity207 and 25 - inch @entity209 flat - panel pcs with blu - ray functionality			0
suite attendees can use the pcs to choose their preference of five camera angles on @entity215 and view any league game , including typically blacked - out contests in @entity218 , and reroute them to the high - def @entity207			0
@entity29 -- @entity219 the primary aspect of the @entity29 ' three - pronged tech upgrade for @entity219 is a 5,940 - square foot scoreboard in center field			1
at 54 by 110 feet , the @entity50 ' board boasts true 1080i display containing more than 2.35 million pixels , compared to the 134,000 pixels produced by the dual 10 - year - old scoreboards it replaces			1
" the technology to support the [ old scoreboards ] was changing , and we were running out of spare parts for them , " @entity29 coo @entity229 told @entity44			0
for example , the new scoreboard , unlike the ones it replaced , does n't require air conditioning to cool it down			0
according to the @entity29 , that will translate into a 50 percent to 65 percent reduction in energy consumption			0
the @entity219 upgrades , which cost almost $ 11 million , also include a refashioned audio system that 'll make it easier for the control room to manage the volume , bass and treble in different areas of the stadium			0
@entity251 could hold key to next - gen @entity252 @entity254 -- @entity255 a new led scoreboard in right field and @entity22 ribbon boards stretching from the the press box to the foul poles along the first - and third - base lines will enable the @entity254 to present customized game and sponsor information to their patrons			2
all three @entity82 boards will have their video powered by @entity81 ' @entity269 display			0
the system allows for a presentation of statistical and game information tailored strictly to @entity255			0
sponsors can also customize their messages to appear on the boards on a game , series , homestand or season - long basis			2
the 6 - by - 160 - foot scoreboard above right field 's @entity281 seats will complement the @entity81 - installed out - of - town scoreboard in left field , implemented before last season			1
the 734 linear feet of ribbon boards permit the @entity254 to show in - game information such as pitch count , type and speed ; play - by - play from the prior three batters ; animation and graphics ; and messages from sponsors and the team 's community relations department			2
@entity30 -- @entity300 though @entity300 only debuted last season , the team spent more than $ 5 million on improvements for the stadium 's sophomore campaign			2
leading the way is a @entity50 hd - 15 led scoreboard in right field , clocking in at 28 feet by 50 feet and providing 552 x 984 resolution			2
the new scoreboard mostly accommodates fans sitting in left field , who often complained of having to crank their heads to view live game video and statistical info on the scoreboard towering over them			0
this off - season , @entity30 owner @entity319 made the move to address all the grumbling			2
" the @entity319 family said we 'll just put up another [ scoreboard ] , which is pretty cool , " @entity30 vp of technology @entity326 told @entity44			0
a new 100 - foot tall , led - illuminated tower adjacent to the right field scoreboard will display situational graphic material and supplementary head - shot content , such as autographs , head - to - toe player pictures and player names and numbers			1
also manufactured by @entity50 , each of the tower 's four sides will incorporate more than 4,300 led strips			2
an improved ballpark - wide @entity19 system with more than 200 access points will be operated by @entity344 , providing fans with information about the game , and ballpark , and even a concession - stand finder			1
@entity350 -- @entity351 the @entity350 will play on a more durable and aesthetically pleasing surface at @entity351 , thanks to @entity354 , the official synthetic turf of @entity11			2
the company 's @entity357 model , installed during a three - week period this spring , contains a @entity360 fiber which ( literally ) stands up to repeated use			2
the fiber 's omega , or " c " , dual - column design imparts mechanical memory to the fiber , so that it pops up even after repeated trampling by cleats and baseballs			2
using 60 ounces of fiber per square yard ensures the surface 's long - term durability			2
the fiber 's design also reflects light , which has a two-fold effect : it reduces surface temperatures by up to 18 percent and cuts down on the sheen produced by ballpark lights			0
the @entity350 ' @entity382 said the old artificial surface would produce a " glazing effect " when the dome 's interior lights were turned on			0
that 's no longer the case , as the improved look and performance of the @entity392 's turf almost mirrors the promise the future holds for @entity395 , @entity396 and the perennially upstart @entity350			0
@entity397 -- @entity398 in @entity399 new video boards in right and center field at @entity398 in @entity399 use @entity50 ' newest 15 - millimeter led technology			1
the 42 - by - 120 - foot scoreboard above the @entity404 in right field and the 25 - by - 29 - foot scoreboard in center field have the versatility to run as single displays or be separated into multiple windows to display various game info			1
a newly installed @entity412 system from @entity50 also allows all existing ribbon and field - level video boards and more than 800 @entity123 lcd monitors throughout the stadium to receive game information on up to 10 high - def channels			1
real - time scores , statistics and even in - game menu pricing changes can be sent to any board or monitor on any @entity412 channel			0
an upgraded control room and a revamped audio system round out the improvements made for last season 's @entity428 champs			1
