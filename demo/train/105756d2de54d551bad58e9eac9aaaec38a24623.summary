-- modern medicine is remarkable , but only if you have access to it			0
in many countries , including the @entity7 , people are suffering because they ca n't get the health care they need			2
three everyday people are trying to help change that , though			2
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , three of this year 's top 10 @entity14 , are medical marvels dedicated to improving other people 's health			1
here 's how each of them , in his or her own way , is trying to save lives : @entity11 the problem : in @entity25 , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the @entity28			1
for comparison 's sake , the ratio in the @entity7 is one doctor for every 413 people			1
and even if they could see a physician , many @entity25 could n't afford it			1
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three - quarters of the country 's health - care spending is private			1
" the only problem they have is poverty , " @entity11 said			1
" and with poverty , they ... can not enjoy their life			0
" how @entity11 took action : seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , @entity11 was determined to do something about it			1
he became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon in @entity53 's @entity52			0
and he started a nonprofit , @entity54 , that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care			1
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people			0
each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care			1
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases			0
others might receive crutches , a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that 's required for school but that many impoverished families simply ca n't afford			2
in the evenings , the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia			0
operations are usually done in a schoolhouse , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person			0
" we are receiving 500 people in each trip , " @entity11 said			1
" they are coming from 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) around the village , and they 're coming on foot			0
" @entity12 the problem : for many children fighting cancer , it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments			1
when @entity12 ' 3 - year - old son , @entity104 , was being treated in 1998 for leukemia , @entity12 met many families who struggled : single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay , kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments , siblings left home alone			1
@entity12 said it broke his heart			2
" it 's extremely tough , not just emotionally , but now financially , " he said			0
" sometimes , both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely			0
some ... do n't have ( an ) extra $ 10 to pay for cafeteria food			0
" how @entity12 took action : when @entity104 died , his father decided he had watched too many people struggle			1
he went back to the hospital in @entity124 where @entity104 had received most of his treatment , and he asked how he could help			2
" transportation , " they said			0
so @entity12 started picking up families in his old @entity129			2
" i was going every day , picking up families all over the county , " he said			0
soon , however , @entity12 could n't handle the number of requests that were coming in			2
so he teamed up with nurses and social workers from the hospital to create a formal transportation program			0
he hired a driver , formalized a schedule for pickups and drop - offs and started the @entity142 in 2003			0
" no child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation , " @entity12 said			2
@entity13 the problem : during a two - week trip to @entity149 in 2008 , @entity13 witnessed countless times when the lives of mothers and babies were at risk simply because of a lack of reliable electricity			1
pregnant women would arrive at the hospital with severe complications , but without adequate light to treat them , procedures had to be compromised or delayed until daylight			0
some women were even turned away			0
" i realized that my skills as an obstetrician - gynecologist were utterly useless ( without ) something as basic as light and electricity , " @entity13 said			2
@entity13 said midwives in @entity149 use all kinds of makeshift lighting when they deliver babies : kerosene lanterns , candles , even cell phones			1
" that 's not adequate light for maternity care , " she said			0
how @entity13 took action : with the help of @entity182 , her husband and a solar energy educator , @entity13 developed a special solar energy kit that can easily provide much - needed light and power for medical equipment			1
since 2009 , the kits have been helping healthcare workers save lives not only in @entity149 but in facilities throughout @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			0
" i really want a world where women can deliver babies safely and with dignity , " @entity13 said			1
check out all of this year 's @entity14			1

three of this year 's top 10 @entity14 are dedicated to saving people 's lives
@entity11 runs free medical clinics in the *poorest* parts of @entity25
@entity12 is giving children rides to their chemotherapy appointments in @entity124
@entity13 created a solar energy kit to make sure babies are delivered safely
