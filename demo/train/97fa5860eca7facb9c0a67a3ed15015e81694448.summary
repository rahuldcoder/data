you wo n't see any pouty lips or peace signs in these selfies			1
the criticized and laughable trend has spread to the devices used to capture them			0
prepping for their ultimate self - portrait , vintage cameras docked on old tripods pucker up for their own selfie against backdrops that bring out their best qualities			1
these unusual photos offer a view of the oft forgotten film cameras that brought us to the digital age and ushered in the selfie			1
wanting to capture the rich history of analog in a modern , striking fashion , photographer and engineer @entity28 developed @entity29 , a continuing project featuring cameras from the 1920s onward			1
@entity28 has a personal tie to some of these antique cameras : the @entity36 was a gift from his father when he turned 6			1
it gave him the outlet to deal with his " creative boosts , " he said , the freedom to isolate moods and generate " special , subjective views on a situation			0
" this passion turned into a portfolio with styles ranging from still life to surreal landscapes			0
@entity28 could think of no better way to pay homage to the medium of his work than by having the cameras themselves display their true colors			1
he began to collect historic cameras from friends or on auction sites like @entity60 for little to nothing			1
" i learned that nondigital cameras seemed in fact to be forgotten ... beautiful and still great equipment i could n't afford a few years ago are now available for a few bucks			2
good for me , but somehow sad , " @entity28 said , reminding him a bit of the " @entity69 " movie			1
" what if those abandoned and forgotten cameras would try to depict themselves and their situation ? without users anymore , looking back upon their glorious times ? " he said			2
social media follow @ @entity77 on @entity78 to join the conversation about photography			0
thus , the idea for @entity29 was born			0
the photographs themselves are not selfies in the traditional definition			2
@entity85 captures them with his modern , digital @entity87 in a small modest studio			1
" i tried to capture them in their ' natural ' and chronologically correct environment , on backgrounds of contemporary wallpapers , " he said			0
@entity29 uses the " selfiemania , " trend to remind the viewer of the origins of photography , and also keep in mind that expressive photography is more than noise reduction , smile detection and technical specifications , he said			0
" these cameras are not only tools reduced to their technical data , but also still an inspiration for artists and a source for creativity			0
here , the viewer is out of the frame , the cameras and the creative potential they offer stand in the foreground			0
" @entity85 is a photographer based in @entity120			2
you can follow him on @entity122 and @entity78 .			0

without the help of pouty faces and @entity128 filters , vintage cameras pose for " selfies "
