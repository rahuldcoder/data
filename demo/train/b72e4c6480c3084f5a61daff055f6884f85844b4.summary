@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 said thursday it expects @entity4 to live up to its obligations , two days after @entity4 's president refused to sign a bill that would pay back billions of dollars @entity4 owes the country			1
@entity3 spent 2.3 billion pounds ( $ 3.69 billion ) last year to cover the losses that @entity3 savers incurred when @entity4 banks collapsed			1
under a @entity13 directive , @entity4 owes compensation to @entity3			2
@entity4 's parliament passed a bill last week authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds , but president @entity20 refused to sign it tuesday			1
it means there will now be a public referendum on whether to approve the bill			2
it also puts into question whether @entity3 can get repaid			0
" we expect @entity4 to live up to its obligations , " said a @entity29 spokesman , who was not authorized to give his name			0
" we support them in finding a way to do that			0
" similar comments came from @entity38 finance minister @entity37 , whose government spent 1.3 billion euros ( $ 1.87 billion ) to cover bank losses in the country			1
despite his refusal to sign the bill , @entity20 told @entity2 wednesday that @entity4 will not shirk its duty to repay the money			1
" @entity4 recognizes its obligations under this agreement , " he said			0
resolving the issue , he added , " is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries			0
" @entity20 acknowledged that the referendum puts repayment in doubt , though he said at the very least , @entity4 opinion polls show the vote will be " very close			1
" he did not explain how @entity4 would repay the money if voters reject the bill			0
@entity3 and the @entity38 said it was too early to speculate on what might happen if voters in @entity4 vote no , but both @entity37 and the @entity29 spokesman said it would have negative consequences internationally for the small @entity66 nation			1
" if the referendum goes against us , then i think @entity4 will have a big problem because they will have shown themselves to be very unreliable partners in the international financial scene , " @entity37 told @entity2			0
@entity37 said non-repayment of the funds would affect " the long - term interest of the @entity4 economy and the @entity4 people			0
" in a statement tuesday , @entity20 said the reason he refused to sign the bill was so it would go to a referendum , which is required by law in such a case			2
he said he received a petition over the weekend , signed by a quarter of the electorate , urging the decision be put to a public vote			0
" it is the cornerstone of the constitutional structure of the @entity4 that the people are the supreme judge of the validity of the law , " @entity20 said in the statement			0
the law passed by @entity4 's parliament would compensate @entity3 and the @entity38 by 2024			1
the @entity97 approved a loan of $ 2.1 billion to @entity4 in november , making repayment of the @entity3 and @entity38 funds a requirement			1
it is unclear how the @entity97 loan would be affected if @entity4 voters were to reject the repayment bill .			2

@entity3 spent $ 3.69 billion last year to cover @entity3 savers ' losses when @entity4 banks collapsed
@entity38 authorities spent $ 1.87 billion for the same reason
@entity4 's parliament passed a bill authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the loan
