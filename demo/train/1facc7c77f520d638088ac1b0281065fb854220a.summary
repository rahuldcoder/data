@entity0 -- the latest video ad from the @entity5 @entity4 campaign arm accuses @entity6 , the @entity7 @entity4 candidate in @entity8 , of supporting amnesty			0
seems like the usual in hyper - partisan @entity0 , right ? but in attacking the @entity7 candidate , the ad also lumps in more than a dozen republicans , including a rising @entity5 star who might run for president in 2016			0
" @entity6 proudly supports @entity19 's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants " flashes across the screen during the 30 - second spot			1
but the ad cites a @entity23 story in which @entity6 expressed her support for a @entity4 immigration bill that passed with the support of 14 republicans , who were led by sen. @entity29 , @entity30 , who is widely viewed as a potential 2016 presidential candidate			2
it would n't be the first time conservatives have painted @entity29 's support for immigration reform as pro-amnesty , but the @entity38 ad is an attack on @entity5 supporters of immigration reform from the establishment			0
so , the @entity5 ad raises the question , does @entity29 also " proudly [ support ] @entity19 's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants " ? first lady hits campaign trail for @entity6			1

@entity5 ad : " @entity6 proudly supports @entity19 's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants "
the *problem* ? the ad is referring to an immigration bill supported by 14 republicans
that bill was pushed to the @entity4 floor thanks in *big* part to @entity5 sen. @entity29
