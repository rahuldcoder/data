-- rapper , entrepreneur , actor , and investor @entity1 , better known by his stage name @entity1 , can add a new credit to his bio : @entity9 - awful pitcher			1
the @entity11 - born rapper threw the first pitch at a @entity14 game last week , and missed , terribly			1
the @entity16 quickly responded , dubbing @entity1 's misstep one of the worst pitches ever , if not the worst			2
in fact , the pitch was so bad that @entity1 , known for hits like " @entity22 " and " in @entity23 , " told @entity24 that a cop pulled him over just to tell him , " you know that pitch was really terrible			2
" then , he let him go			2
no ticket , just a laugh			0
is @entity1 's whiff really as bad as @entity31 , @entity32 , or @entity34 's attempts at first - pitchdom ? maybe not , but his explanation certainly was			0
in a @entity37 on tuesday , a user asked , " yo $ 0.50 ... what happened on that first pitch ? " his response : " i have skeletal muscle injury on my left shoulder from excessive masturbation so take it easy lol			1
" he has to be kidding , right ? you be the judge			0
