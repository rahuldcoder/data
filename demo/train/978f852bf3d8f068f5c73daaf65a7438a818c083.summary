-- there 's a children 's book from 1977 called @entity4			1
in it , all the houses on one block look the same			2
until one day , when a pelican drops a bucket of orange paint on one roof			0
instead of painting over it , and returning to the status quo , mr. @entity12 decorates the roof — and then the facade , and then the yard — with wild , rainbow patterns			2
his neighbors think he 's lost his mind			0
but one by one they see the beauty in individual expression , however weird and wacky it may look at first			0
the popular book sounds like an allegory about communism , and conformist lifestyles			2
and as it turns out , something similar happened in the @entity32 countryside in the 1960s , during the height of communism			1
the result — those decorated houses — are the subject of @entity32 cubes , by @entity40			1
from 1965 to 1988 , @entity41 ran things in @entity32			2
unlike the leaders of the other @entity46 countries , @entity43 practiced a sort of relaxed strain of communism : the @entity50 had a free market , and was tolerant ( more than @entity52 , at least ) of individual voices and public dissent			0
these policies ultimately became known as " @entity56			0
" it 's fitting , then , that during the @entity56 era , a peculiar architectural trend took off : people started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes , in wild shades of color			1
it might be more accurate to say a decorating , or public art movement , began to take off , because the architecture style in question began in the 1920s , long before @entity43 's time			2
it followed the principles of communist urban planning : city blocks filled with square , economical row houses			2
they were designed for efficiency , meaning every house was the same , and every house was boring			0
that did n't last forever			0
in @entity32 cubes , @entity40 documents those countryside row houses during @entity43 's reign , after residents started freewheeling with colors and shapes to make it so no two houses looked like			1
@entity40 noticed the painted " @entity93 " , or @entity94 , houses in 2003 after moving from @entity91 to a small @entity32 town			1
some of the homes have trompe l'oeil paintings around the window , like facsimiles of shutters or trimming			0
others look like abstracted images of sun rays , or harvested crops			0
" today you can buy a car you like , you can do everything you like			0
in this uniform world where people were not allowed to have some individuality , you had to wait for the same car as your neighbor , " @entity40 says			1
" the facade is what i can show to the outside to the world			0
this was a free space at this time where the people can show and express their individuality			2
" @entity40 has spent years photographing the @entity93 houses			1
she 's met some of the original owners , but also is watching as the @entity125 undergo renovations and new paint jobs			0
" the intellectual elite in @entity32 they hate the kind of housing and the period and the ornamental decoration , " @entity40 says			1
in @entity32 cubes , she writes : " in the eyes of the rural population , these houses are simply no longer up - to - date and are therefore ... these witnesses to a way of life are slowly but surely disappearing			1
" the houses are a relic of some rare individualism during a time of homogeneous , community - centric thinking			1
