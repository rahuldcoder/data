on the foggy , icy @entity2 interstate , @entity0 plowed into the back of a jackknifed semi truck , flipping his pickup			1
then the real horror came : the sight of another tractor - trailer zooming straight toward him			1
" when i saw those lights coming , i knew he was going to hit me , " @entity0 said			1
" and then i closed my eyes and prayed that everything turned out ok			2
that was all i could do			2
" he gripped the steering wheel tightly as the second semi smashed through his pickup , crushing it like a soda can			1
" it was just metal crunching and glass			2
it was just all fast and loud			2
" @entity0 told @entity3 's " @entity25 " that he was a man of faith			1
" i do believe , and i 'm very firm in that , and i just held on to the wheel as tight as i could , tucked my head and just kept praying the whole time			2
after he hit , i just hoped that it would be over with soon , " he said			2
the crash left only two things intact : the marred shell surrounding @entity37 's seat , and @entity37 , who was pinned between the two trucks			0
" when the second truck hit my back end , it spun my bed underneath the first trailer that i hit and continued to swing my nose around , and i guess put my nose underneath the second trailer			1
and as that trailer came around , it just kind of pushed me down and further into that -- that small v where you can actually see both the trailers within arm 's reach on both sides			0
and so if they would 've pushed me even a foot , it would have crushed me , " the 27 - year - old father said			1
and nearly scratch - free			1
@entity0 was part of a 26 - vehicle pileup saturday on @entity63 outside @entity64 , @entity2			1
" this is the biggest crash i have seen in a while , " @entity66 sgt. @entity65 said			0
" it was extremely slick out there			0
one semi that spun around on the black ice started the chain reaction			1
" about a dozen people were injured , including two seriously			0
but there were no fatalities			0
" it 's surprising no one died in this , " @entity65 said			0
before trying to wiggle out , @entity0 decided to let the sound of traffic subside " to make sure things were ok			1
" then passers - by came to help			1
" one guy pulled my feet out just enough so i could slide out of the car			0
" @entity37 's injuries ? a bruise on his left eyebrow and a few scratches on his right hand			0
he told " @entity25 " he thanked @entity92 for his survival			0
" i do n't have the answers , and if i did , i probably would n't be doing what i 'm doing now			0
when things like that happen , and what i 've kinda come to realize , is that it is a miracle and that i need to take that into my life and remember it , and now i need to figure out who i need to be in this life and what i need to accomplish			0
" because how many people do n't get the chance -- a second chance -- at escaping a situation like that ? "			0
