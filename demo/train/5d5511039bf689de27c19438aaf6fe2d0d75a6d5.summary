-- @entity1 failed to keep pace in the @entity4 title race with record breaking @entity5 saturday after being held goalless at @entity6			1
with the pressure on after @entity5 's 4 - 1 win at @entity9 , its 20th straight , @entity1 just could not find the way past the home defense			1
it trails its arch - rival by four points with @entity5 headed to @entity14 sunday to play in @entity16 's @entity15			1
" the draw is n't a great result , " @entity1 captain @entity17 told @entity18			2
" there 's still a long way to go in the league , but admittedly it 's a step backwards , " he added			0
the @entity25 giant was missing @entity27 star @entity26 through an ankle injury but otherwise fielded a strong side in the @entity30 @entity31 -- still searching for his first @entity4 goal for his new club -- went close in the first half after turning an effort just wide , while both sides had penalty appeals for handball turned down			2
@entity39 almost broke the deadlock after the break but saw a free kick rattle the crossbar and he also headed over from a good position			0
it was a rare failure to register on the score sheet for @entity39 , all the more galling after his scoring rival @entity47 scored a late double in @entity5 's victory the previous evening			2
@entity47 had been a largely peripheral figure for 80 minutes until adding two fine late strikes to earlier goals from @entity53 and @entity54 for the @entity56 champions			0
it took his tally in @entity4 to 25 for the season			0
@entity60 had given @entity9 hope with a thumping strike to level @entity53 's opener and @entity5 also had @entity64 to thank for saving a second half penalty to keep his side in front			0
@entity68 continues to set a hot pace in the @entity70 , bouncing back after a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity72 last weekend to beat 10 - man @entity73 2 - 0 at @entity75 saturday			1
@entity76 put @entity78 's men ahead early , but the home side was helped by the controversial dismissal of @entity73 's @entity81 's for a challenge on @entity83 on the hour mark			0
@entity85 wrapped up the three points with his 12th of the season soon afterwards			0
it left @entity68 three points clear of reigning champion @entity90 , who continued its fine recent form with a 1 - 0 victory at bottom side @entity95			1
former @entity68 star @entity97 scored the winning goal for @entity95 , his 175th in the @entity70 , in the first half			1
but the visitors lost @entity101 and @entity102 to worrying injuries ahead of the busy @entity105 program in @entity106			0
third - placed @entity107 is now eight points behind its city rival ahead of a crunch home match against @entity111 sunday			0
@entity113 's march to yet another @entity115 title continues unchecked , thrashing @entity116 4 - 0			1
it left @entity113 10 points clear of @entity119 , the second - placed side playing @entity121 sunday in an attempt to close the gap			1
after a goalless first - half , visitors @entity113 dominated after the break as @entity127 ace @entity126 netted twice while @entity128 and @entity129 were also on target			2
meanwhile , @entity113 's traditional rival @entity131 slipped back into the relegation zone with a 1 - 0 defeat at fellow struggler @entity134			1
former @entity131 player @entity136 scored the only goal of the match against his old club , who slip to 16th with only four wins from 15 @entity115 games this season .			0

@entity1 held to 0 - 0 draw at @entity6
loses ground to @entity5 in @entity4 title race
@entity68 beats @entity73 to stay top of @entity70
@entity113 10 points clear in @entity115
