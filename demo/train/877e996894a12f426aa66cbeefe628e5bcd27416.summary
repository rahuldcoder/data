-- uncertainty over the fate of missing @entity3 was further compounded saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen			1
@entity11 authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database , @entity0 has learned			1
after the airline released a manifest of the 239 people on the plane , @entity14 denied that one of its citizens was on the flight as the list had stated			2
the @entity14 citizen was safe and sound , and his passport had been stolen two years ago , @entity24 spokesman @entity23 said			2
similarly , @entity28 's foreign ministry confirmed that no @entity28 were on the flight , even though an @entity28 was listed on the manifest			2
@entity11 officials said they were aware of reports that the @entity28 's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it			1
on saturday , @entity28 police visited the home of the parents of @entity37 , the man whose name appeared on the manifest , to inform them about the missing flight , said a police official in @entity41 , in northern @entity28			0
@entity37 's father , @entity42 , told police that he had just spoken to his son , who was fine and not on the missing flight , said the official , who is not authorized to speak to the media			0
@entity37 was vacationing in @entity48 , his father said			0
the police official said that @entity37 had reported his passport stolen in @entity11 last august and had obtained a new one			1
@entity52 law enforcement sources , however , told @entity0 they 've been told that both documents were stolen in @entity48			1
still , the missing passports raised concerns about the possibility of terrorism			1
a law enforcement official saturday told @entity0 that various @entity52 government agencies were briefed about the passports			1
the names of the persons whose passports were stolen have been circulated and checked , the official said			2
there 's nothing at this point to indicate foul play on their part			0
the @entity72 announced late saturday that a team of its investigators was en route to @entity76 to help with the investigation , the agency said			1
" they will be positioned to offer @entity52 assistance , " the @entity72 said of the team , which also includes technical advisers from @entity80 and the @entity81			1
plane bore painters , pilgrims , others from around the world @entity90 help the @entity90 is ready to send agents to @entity76 if requested by the @entity11 government , but no agents have been sent yet , @entity52 officials familiar with the issue told @entity0 on saturday night on condition of anonymity			1
earlier saturday , an official said @entity90 agents were heading to the area			0
@entity52 authorities have not ruled out terrorism -- or anything else -- as a cause of the airliner 's disappearance			1
@entity0 law enforcement analyst @entity107 , a former @entity90 assistant director , was told by sources at @entity109 , which keeps a database of lost or stolen travel documents , that the stolen @entity28 passport was in the agency 's database			1
the reportedly stolen @entity14 passport was not			0
@entity11 authorities apparently did not check @entity109 's database , sources told @entity107			1
" @entity109 's database has 39 million records of stolen travel documents at the present time , " he said			1
" one billion passengers a year board international flights where there 's no inquiry made of that database			0
so it leaves an opening			0
" referring to the stolen documents , @entity107 added , " you wonder who was using it ? what were their motives ? were they using it to check luggage in that matched the tickets , and maybe the luggage contained explosives ? so , it 's a great concern when people use false documents to board international aircraft			2
" traces of oil spotted near area plane lost contact a @entity52 intelligence official said authorities had established " no nexus to terrorism yet although that 's by no means definitive			1
" @entity11 authorities reiterated during a news conference that they are not ruling anything out regarding the missing aircraft			1
in the @entity52 , @entity107 said , passports are routinely checked against the @entity109 database			1
" even in the @entity52 , we have a tremendous problem with our documentation , our driver 's licenses , " said @entity163 , former inspector general of the @entity52 @entity164			2
" everything can be forged and faked here			0
we certainly have a problem with that as well			0
but that 's why you have the various checklists to check against and had they been identified as stolen passports ... there was a way to flag them in advance			1
that 's what is disturbing , as it apparently was n't checked			0
" @entity185 mystery @entity163 also expressed surprise that two potentially stolen passports may have been used to board the flight			1
" it 's rare that you have one stolen passport , much less two stolen passports on a flight			1
it 's starting to look like more than a coincidence , " she said			0
she added it was especially surprising given the destination of the flight was @entity199			0
" @entity52 citizens have to have visas ... and you ca n't get on board the plane without showing the visa , " she explained			2
" for a stolen passport , stolen two years ago -- these visas only last for a certain amount of time			0
so , did they ( the authorities ) not check ? did @entity199 not clear or have to issue a visa ? there are a lot of questions about these passports because the destination was @entity199			2
" first officer was transitioning to 777 - 200s safest part of flight no one is sure what happened to the plane			0
air traffic controllers lost track of it after it left @entity227 , the capital of @entity11 , on its way to @entity199 on friday			2
the plane was cruising during what experts consider to be the safest part of the journey when it vanished			0
@entity235 , a former investigator with the @entity72 , said there were multiple scenarios of what could have gone wrong , including structural problems with the wings or fuselage			2
" of course , you also have to look at in that part of the world and around the world there is still a potential for a terrorist act or an intentional act that could have rendered the airplane incapacitated , " he said			0
he added : " whatever happened , happened very quickly			0
for them to have lost two - way radio communication with ( air traffic control ) , two - way radio communication with the company , and to lose any kind of radar data with ground control facilities means that the airplane was compromised in a very quick manner and it may have been well beyond the control of the crew to keep the airplane under control and make any kind of emergency distress call or emergency landing			0
" how a jet goes missing @entity0 's @entity269 in @entity270 , @entity271 in @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
