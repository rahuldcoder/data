@entity1 , @entity0 -- top flight golf is a high - stakes , high - stress sport -- but it 's not just the pros who are feeling the strain			1
stress can affect golfers of all abilities			2
swede @entity12 returned from a four - month layoff recently with an eye condition that 's thought to be stress - related , while @entity0 's @entity15 defended his decision not to play in the @entity17 by saying that he wanted to avoid fatigue -- mental as well as physical			0
while professional sport is bound to have its pressures , recreational golf is usually regarded as a way to unwind and relieve stress			1
but it seems that weekend players are having to deal with anxieties of their own			0
@entity27 , a @entity1 - based sports psychologist , told @entity2 that golf is a much more psychological sport than most			1
" it can be particularly stressful because , unlike team sports , you very much have the spotlight on you while you 're playing , " he said			1
" you 've got a lot of time between your shots for you to think , time for other people to watch you and time for you to think about what people will think of you if you do n't play well			0
" that does n't just apply when there 's an audience of millions watching on tv -- it 's just as true when you 're playing at your local municipal course with your friends			2
" it can actually be tougher playing against your mates and people you know because they can ridicule you or laugh at you , or you might worry about disappointing them if you 're playing on their team , " said @entity27			1
that would appear to be borne out by a 2004 study on the moods of older recreational golfers			1
the subjects reported being no happier or calmer after playing golf -- in fact , they reported feeling more angry and depressed			1
one of the researchers , @entity60 , senior lecturer in sport and exercise science at the @entity63 , told @entity2 that the study also showed that golfers reported feeling more fatigued and less vigorous after playing golf , as most players walked an average 10.2 km during a game			1
@entity60 's study was carried out on " senior " golfers , with an average age of 68 , but he said the findings on mood change tied in with other studies carried out on younger recreational golfers			1
" @entity76 does appear to be stressful for recreational players , " he told @entity2			2
" if we wanted golfers to enjoy it more fully it might be nice to engage with golfers and bring potential negative moods to their attention			0
" while those negative feelings probably do n't last for long , they can have disastrous effects on your golf			0
@entity27 says negative thoughts on the golf course can make you tense and frustrated , giving you an adrenaline rush that can affect your swing and timing			2
as you start dropping shots you can overanalyze your game , which just make things worse			0
the secret of dealing with golf stress is to get on top of your thoughts , says @entity27			1
rather than thinking in terms of how badly you 're playing or what other people will think of you , you need to realize that your emotions are getting the better of you and that anxiety is the problem , not your technique			0
so with all that stress , could playing golf actually be bad for you ? " if you 're beating yourself up emotionally and getting angry that 's not very good for your health , " said @entity27			1
" but it 's all a matter of attitude			0
somebody might go out and enjoy it , see it as a chance to get away from work , have a nice stroll and catch up with their mates			0
" and @entity60 has encouraging news when it comes to golf and health			2
he has carried out unpublished work showing that a round of golf can give a significant reduction in blood pressure			0
" my gut feeling is that golf is incredibly positive for health , " he told @entity2			2
" the positives of the distance walked , the heart - rate increase and the blood - pressure suppression will outweigh any negative mood states			0
but it might be that we need to recognize that mood profiles can go down and mediate against that			0

golf is especially stressful , says sports psychologist @entity27
@entity27 says that it can be even tougher playing with your friends
study shows recreational golfers feel more angry and depressed after playing
stress may be bad for you , but golf can still be good for your health
