@entity0 , @entity1 -- workers at @entity6 subsidiary in southeastern @entity1 intentionally slowed down production at the facility monday , after returning from a strike , the company said			1
previously it was believed that the job dispute -- which , among other strikes of @entity1 @entity6 plant has impacted the global supply pipeline of its cars -- was resolved when the company offered a 200 yuan ( @entity16 $ 30 ) per month pay increase			1
the plant employs about 1,500 people			0
@entity20 -- a subsidiary of @entity22 which makes locks , door sensors and mirrors for the company -- believed the negotiations were settled with an agreement reached on saturday			0
but monday , a spokesperson for the company told @entity2 it is " embarrassed to report 90 percent of the factory workers are slowing down inside the factory today , " a @entity29 spokesperson said			2
the company is working to redress the situation , the spokesperson said			0
the wages debate at @entity29 is a microcosm of labor disputes that are sweeping companies across developed regions of @entity1			1
as workers seek better wages and working conditions , concerns are being raised that the turbulence could disrupt @entity1 's development model of offering multinational companies access to a massive , low - cost labor force			1
" this is an ongoing process since @entity1 joined the @entity49 ( in 2001 )			1
@entity1 workers have enjoyed pay raises for some years , " @entity50 , chief asian investment strategist for @entity51 , told @entity2			1
" we 've come to a point where we will see more wage increases because a lot of national or multinational company 's minimum wage level is below the market level -- that 's why we see more strikes and more unrest , " @entity50 said			1
productivity in @entity1 has increased faster than pay increases , @entity50 said , and could hasten the trend of moving labor - intensive labor farther inland or to other low - cost labor centers such as @entity69 and @entity70			1
@entity29 workers interviewed by @entity2 said they want their monthly base salary increased to 1600 yuan ( $ 234 )			2
the basic salary used to be 900 yuan , workers said , although with overtime that usually rose to about 1200 yuan ( $ 175 ) a month			2
they were seeking a pay increase similar to the 500 yuan ( $ 73 ) pay increase given to workers striking at the @entity82 company			1
" our salary is not enough			0
( after ) living costs and rent , we have nothing left , " one worker , who asked not to be named , told @entity2			0
adds @entity88 , another worker there : " @entity6 is @entity6 and we are also @entity6			1
living cost is similar but how come their salary is so high ? " monday 's on - the - job slowdown was the latest tit - for - tat in the ongoing labor dispute at the @entity97 plant , located in @entity98 near @entity99			2
even as an agreement appeared to be reached on saturday , the @entity6 plant was actively recruiting replacement workers over the weekend in case the negotiations were unsuccessful to return existing employees to the line			1
" i 've been looking for a job for months -- i may want to work there , " one person in line for a job interview told @entity2			2
on monday morning , a factory manager stood outside and counted down the minutes before the morning shift began , threatening that strikers who did not return back to work would be replaced			2
about 100 employees were demonstrating outside before most went back into the factory to begin the morning shift			0
still , some workers say they are willing to be fired in their quest for better wages -- especially since there are regional job shortages for qualified workers			0
" if most of us are fired because of this , i am not scared			0
around here there are many factories with high salaries , " one worker told @entity2			0
she said she hopes she will be able to send more money back home to her parents with her salary increase			0
" i do n't have any money left after deducting rent and meals , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity139 contributed to this report			0

workers return from strike , but slow down *assembly* line
@entity6 workers want *bigger* pay increases
pay is *escalating* in @entity1 's developing regions
