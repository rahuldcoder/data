@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 leaders are putting together a second economic stimulus package that could cost as much as $ 150 billion , according to @entity3 leadership aides			1
house speaker @entity7 has said the economic crisis may warrant a $ 150 billion stimulus package			1
the aides said @entity3 are likely to call @entity11 back shortly after the election to vote on the measure			1
the details are still in flux , but one aide said the price tag would be " somewhat north of $ 100 billion " and would include " a heavy emphasis on help to state and local governments			2
" one way to help states would be to fund the mandatory state match for @entity26 programs so that states would not have to slash education and other programs to cover it			0
before @entity11 recessed last week for the election , the @entity4 passed economic aid measures totaling $ 61 billion to fund infrastructure projects , money for states ' medicaid costs , and unemployment assistance			1
but these bills failed to attract enough support in the @entity39 , and the @entity40 opposed them			0
" with all that happened in the past few weeks , it probably has to be more like ... $ 150 billion to invest in our economy , to create jobs , to help the states , to help men and women across the country , " house speaker @entity7 , @entity42 , said wednesday while traveling in @entity43 , @entity44			2
@entity7 and other @entity4 @entity3 leaders are scheduled to meet monday with a group of economists in @entity0 to discuss the size and components of a stimulus plan , the @entity3 aides said			1
these aides indicated that in addition to aid to states struggling with their budgets , the package could include things similar to what the @entity4 passed before , such as infrastructure money , an extension of unemployment benefits , food stamps and more money for low - income energy assistance			2
@entity4 @entity75 leadership aides said that @entity75 members have not been consulted on the details of a second stimulus			1
one of these aides said , " we 're not necessarily opposed to it out of hand			0
we would ask , is it truly stimulative ? is it really going to help stimulate the economy ? " a @entity39 @entity75 leadership aide said @entity86 are skeptical of a second stimulus but did not suggest there is outright opposition to another package			2
@entity91 , a spokesman for @entity39 majority leader @entity92 , @entity93 , left the door open to the @entity39 taking up a bill			0
" sen. @entity92 tried to pass a second economic recovery bill last month , only to be obstructed by @entity86 , " @entity91 said			0
" recent developments only reinforce the need for additional action to reinvigorate the economy			0
we will work with the @entity4 and leave all options open to address this issue			0
