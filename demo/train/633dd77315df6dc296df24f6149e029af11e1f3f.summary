-- @entity1 came to @entity2 months ago			1
it 's loud and scary in @entity5 's capital			1
but now , this week , something seems different			2
and that makes @entity9 feel better			2
the @entity2 resident , who sides with the rebellion , says it means the forces fighting to oust president @entity14 are winning			1
" the rebels are winning , can you see ? " she insisted during a @entity18 call wednesday			2
" the regime feels threatened			2
you can feel it here			0
" @entity9 , a former teacher in her 30s , told @entity0 that she 's hearing more helicopters hovering over her home this week			0
traffic near the presidential palace is more hectic			0
@entity30 , she said , and the price of gas goes higher			0
@entity33 spearheads diplomatic push on @entity5 but the chaos , the uncertainty and booms of shells landing that keep her awake at night , now fill her with hope			1
@entity2 is the seat of @entity14 's power			1
rebel forces seem to be fighting harder than ever in the capital and , according to analysts and on - the - ground observers like @entity9 , @entity14 is acting like a boxer who fears his own knock - out is coming			1
" the worse it gets now , the more we know the rebels will win , " she said			0
" we welcome this fight			0
it means we will wake up from this nightmare			0
" in the past several weeks , the rebels -- once disorganized , dysfunctional and poorly armed -- have made major strategic and psychological gains			1
they have seized control of key oil fields and territory in important areas of the north			1
they have audaciously fired on the @entity2 airport and downed several military aircraft			1
@entity5 rebels challenge @entity14 's command of the skies rebels pounced on a key @entity73 headquarters outside the northern city of @entity75 , seizing a large cache of weapons , and leaving the regime so desperate it bombed its own bases to prevent the rebels from getting any more			1
it was another blow to @entity5 's army , which experts say is spent , stretched thin by desertions and defections			1
@entity5 rebels in @entity2 say they are more organized , better armed with heavy weaponry , and ready to " cleanse @entity5 " of government forces , @entity87 spokesman @entity86 told @entity0			1
he said the rebels have " started the ending battle " of the war			2
" we are conducting significant military operation inside the capital @entity2 , this is a new stage , " @entity86 said wednesday via @entity18 from the @entity2 suburbs			1
" this is the decisive stage of our fight			0
" and , international support for the rebels ' cause appears to be increasing			0
@entity104 recently approved sending @entity106 missiles to @entity107 , which supports the rebels			0
@entity109 and other pivotal @entity111 countries have said they also back the movement against @entity14			0
those opposed to @entity14 -- including the @entity33 -- have said for months that the @entity5 leader 's days are numbered			1
now , there are signs of desperation : @entity120 is reportedly considering his asylum options , despite insisting that he will " live and die in @entity5			1
" he is also reportedly considering using chemical weapons on his own people			2
and the @entity5 government has been blamed for temporarily shutting down internet service in the country last week , an alleged attempt to thwart rebel communication			1
so , with key rebel advances in the north and signs of desperation in @entity2 , many observers believe the end is in sight for @entity5 's 21 - month - old brutal civil war			1
the regime is clinging to the capital , @entity2 , as rebels chip away at the military , according to regional analysts			1
and the rebels do n't have the clout to go toe - to - toe with the government in the center of @entity2 , according to senior analyst @entity145			1
" it ( the @entity5 rebellion ) will not be able to overthrow the @entity14 regime for the foreseeable future , " wrote @entity145 of the @entity147 - based @entity146			1
but , he said , that does n't mean a certain victory for @entity14 ' forces			0
" the regime does not have the forces required to hold all of @entity5 , and its control is steadily eroding across the country			1
" attack not best way to stop @entity5 's chemical weapons ' we thought it would be over fast ' if this is a crossroads in the war , the road leading to it has been long and hard			1
@entity5 's conflict began in march 2011 , when protesters like @entity9 took to the streets to peacefully call for more freedom			1
they were inspired by @entity171 demonstrations that toppled dictators in @entity173 and @entity174			0
" i have to tell you , we thought it would be over fast , " @entity9 said			0
" i never thought it would come this far			0
none of us expected to lose this many friends			0
" she pauses , her voice breaking			0
" we ... knew the regime was strong , but not that ... fierce			0
i guess we did not expect how terrible it would be			0
" the most heinous acts man is capable of inflicting on others have happened in @entity5			2
journalists , @entity5 and human rights workers say the military has gone house to house and shot dead entire families			2
@entity194 kills 10 children on a playground children , they say , have been abducted , tortured and killed and dumped on their parents ' front door			0
there are allegations of underground torture facilities across the country			0
the @entity5 government denies it is targeting its own people , saying it has gone after " terrorists " that are seeking to overthrow the government			2
while it 's tough to pin down estimates of regime forces and rebel fighters , most analysts agree that the @entity5 government still retains vast superiority in firepower over the rebel fighters			1
yet there 's a " turning process " going on in @entity5 , according to analyst @entity218 , who recently visited the region			2
" @entity222 , combat spirit ( within regime forces ) seems to be degrading , " said @entity218 , a defense fellow at the @entity221			0
" the rebels are getting stronger , they keep forming units , they keep getting defectors , they keep getting personnel			0
" the rebel movement has grown bottom - up , a fighting force replete with @entity5 army defectors , @entity5 citizens , and @entity233 -- from inside and outside the country			1
regional commands are emerging , and units are working together			0
the government has ceded huge swaths of territory in the north , and has n't been able to oust rebels from the most populous city of @entity75 , which is almost fully under rebel control			2
as fighting subsides , @entity75 residents find little left " the opposition pretty much owns @entity5 , " said @entity246 , research director at the @entity248 - based @entity247			1
" the regime hardcore -- they are in the red in the ledger now , not in the black			0
" the rebels have now emerged as a " quasi-professional army			0
" he said their advances have made make it " much easier to impose a no - fly zone in the north of @entity5 " -- if that happens			2
yet , the @entity5 military hopes to gain advantage with its superior firepower by locking down key urban centers , such as @entity2 and @entity265			1
but @entity246 notes that the government has n't had a major military victory in the north of @entity5 for months , and the rebels have effectively encircled @entity2			1
it also has n't embarked on major ground offensives , like the one in @entity75 earlier this year			0
such activity puts the army at risk of more defections and desertions			0
@entity5 's @entity14 regime has fight left despite rebels ' advances frustration , optimism as analysts study every move by the rebels and government forces to determine @entity5 's endgame , the people living there -- some filled with hope , others mired in frustration -- want to know when it will end			1
echoing a common sentiment among many @entity5 , a @entity5 blogger in @entity265 , who calls himself " @entity292 , " says recent attempts by the international community are all too little , too late			2
" @entity5 are doing things on their own and no one will help them , " he told @entity0			2
" the world watched and is still watching @entity5 get slaughtered and did nothing and will continue to do nothing , so empty threats mean nothing to us , " he said			2
he dismissed recent reports that @entity104 had approved deploying @entity106 missiles near the @entity107 - @entity5 border as an " empty threat			2
" he also rejected the recent outcry over the threat of chemical weapons against @entity5 , saying , " the only reason they 're saying these threats is to pretend that they might actually do something and they wo n't			1
" " they only do n't want chemical weapons to be used against @entity318 but i know , and everyone here knows , that if they were used against @entity5 , nothing will happen and no threats will come true			1
" in @entity2 , @entity9 remains optimistic about an impending rebel victory -- but she admits that the nearly two - year - long road to revolution has changed her and others risking their lives for a new @entity5			1
back then , they were idealists , beginner revolutionaries			0
" you want your freedom , democracy , better healthcare , work , education , " she said			0
" she loved her life before , but she is going to love it even more when the rebels win			0
because they will win , she insists			0
" have n't we shown that ? " she asked			0
" does n't the world understand that by now ? " @entity5 's chemical weapon potential : what is it , and what are the health risks ? @entity0 's @entity349 contributed to this report			2

*stepped* up fighting in @entity2 signifies the beginning of end , one @entity5 says
rebel gains in past month : taking oil fields , downing aircraft , getting weapons
observers : *climate* has changed in @entity5 , the war may be *wrapping* up
