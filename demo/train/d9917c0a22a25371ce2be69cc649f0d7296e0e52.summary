@entity0 -- @entity2 has learned his lesson : do n't ever cancel on @entity4			1
appearing on @entity8 ' " @entity7 with @entity4 " thursday , the @entity6 presidential candidate apologized for skipping out on a scheduled visit in september that @entity4 later made the subject of an ongoing joke			1
" i screwed up , " @entity2 told @entity4 more than once in the interview that aired thursday night			1
@entity2 's appearance on the show comes three weeks after he raised the ire of the generally mild - mannered host by canceling at the last minute , citing his decision to suspend his presidential campaign because of the financial crisis			1
" this does n't smell right , " @entity4 said			2
" this is not the way a tested hero behaves			0
somebody 's putting something in his @entity26			0
" @entity4 also did n't appear to buy the @entity29 senator 's explanation for the cancellation			2
at the time , he showed the audience a live feed of @entity2 preparing for an interview with @entity8 anchor @entity34			2
after praising @entity2 's record as a prisoner of war in @entity37 , he said , " this is not the @entity2 i know , by @entity39			1
" @entity4 has repeatedly harped on @entity2 for the missed appearance , noting the @entity29 senator 's poll numbers appeared to begin to slide right after he skipped out on the show			1
" look at all the conversation i gave you			0
including having mr. @entity49 on , " @entity2 told @entity4 thursday night , referencing the @entity47 liberal talk show host who filled in for him that night			2
however , thursday 's interview was not all fun and games , as @entity4 pressed @entity2 on @entity6 vp @entity54 's preparedness to lead the country through " the next 9/11 attack			1
. " " absolutely , " she is , @entity2 said			2
" she has inspired @entity58			0
that 's the thing we need			0
" @entity2 said her experience as a mayor , governor and @entity66 member have prepared her to be president			0
" in all due respect , one of the people i admired most was an obscure governor of a southern state called @entity73 and he turned out to be a fairly successful president , " @entity2 said			0
" i mean , @entity75 was a cowboy , no experience in international affairs			0
so , look , i think she has shown leadership			0
" when @entity4 asked @entity2 about @entity54 's charge that @entity83 " palled around with terrorists , " the senator said " he did			1
" @entity2 said that while @entity83 might have been just a child when @entity85 founded the @entity86 , a @entity87 era group blamed for several domestic bombings			1
@entity85 recently said he regretted not doing more attacks			0
" mr. @entity85 , on 2001 , september 11 , 2001 said , ' i wish i had bombed more , ' " said @entity2			2
@entity2 's reference was to a @entity92 story published on september 11 , 2001 , when @entity85 wrote " i do n't regret setting bombs ... i feel we did n't do enough			1
" later , after the issue was raised in an april primary debate by sen. @entity97 , @entity85 posted his 2001 reply to the @entity92 story on his blog , saying , " i said i had a thousand regrets , but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength			0

" i screwed up , " @entity2 tells @entity4 for canceling scheduled visit
@entity4 used @entity2 's no - show as subject of ongoing joke
@entity2 also *discussed* @entity54 , @entity83 's ties to *1960s* ' radical @entity85
