-- attempting to advance his nation 's peace progress with insurgents , @entity2 president @entity1 said unofficial negotiations with the @entity7 have been taking place and hopes the formation of a peace council will further those efforts			1
" we have been talking to the @entity7 as countryman to countryman , talk in that manner , " @entity1 told @entity0 's " @entity17 " in an interview scheduled to air monday night			2
" not as a regular official contact with the @entity7 with a fixed address , but rather unofficial personal contacts have been going on for quite some time			2
" in excerpts of the interview released sunday , @entity1 also spoke on the @entity23 , an initiative headed by former @entity2 president @entity25 and tasked with boosting negotiations with @entity7 insurgents			1
" the @entity7 , those of whom who are @entity2 and the sons of @entity2 soil , who have been driven to violence by various factors beyond their control and beyond ours caused by circumstances in @entity2 , we want them to come back to their country , " @entity1 said			1
" they are like kids who have run away ... from the family			0
the family should try to bring them back and give them better discipline and incorporate them back into their family and society			0
president @entity25 assuming chairmanship today of the peace council is exactly in that spirit			1
" however , the @entity2 government will work against groups like @entity55 , he said			2
" but those who are a part of @entity55 and the other terrorist networks who are ideologically against us or who are working against @entity2 knowingly and out of the purpose of hatred and enmity -- those of course we have to work against			2
whether they are against @entity2 or whether they are @entity55 and the terrorist war against the @entity69 or our neighbors in @entity72 , those of course can not be accepted			2
" @entity1 's remarks about the unofficial contacts with the @entity7 came when the president was asked about a @entity79 report that secret high - level talks between the government and the @entity7 were underway			1
" now that the peace council has come into existence , these talks will go on , and will go on officially and more rigorously , i hope , " @entity1 said			1
the @entity2 president denied a report that he has been diagnosed as manic - depressive in a book by veteran @entity90 journalist @entity89			1
in his book " @entity92 , " @entity89 cited @entity69 intelligence reports			0
" he 's on his meds ; he 's off his meds , " @entity89 quoted @entity69 ambassador @entity94 as saying about @entity1			0

he said from time to time , he also takes vitamin c , multivitamins and @entity103 , " when i have a headache or when i 'm tired			0
" he denied being manic - depressive , calling the story " rather funny			1
" asked about the planned drawdown of @entity69 troops in @entity2 next summer , and relations with president @entity109 , @entity1 said , " relations with president @entity109 are very good " and the two are in regular contact and had a video conference about five days ago			2
" the relation with the @entity69 government is generally good , " he said			0
" there is a strategic relationship between us , partnerships toward an objective -- that 's security for us and security for the @entity69 and the rest of the world			0
" " on the staying power of the @entity69 in @entity2 , the @entity2 people have been abandoned before when we fought the @entity127 , " he said			1
" when we defeated communism and the @entity127 , the international community supported us , but then after their defeat we were abandoned and forgotten immediately , including by the @entity69			0
" he said the fear the same thing could happen lingers among the @entity2 , and he has not been able to reassure them			0
" i hope the @entity69 and our other allies will help us through good means so we can reassure the @entity2 people that this partnership is staying and that @entity2 will emerge out of this current transition into a better country , a better economy and a more stronger , effective state , " @entity1 said			1
