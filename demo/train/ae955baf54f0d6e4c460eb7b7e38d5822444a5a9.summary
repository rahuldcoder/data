they may be mistakes of technique , judgment , ignorance or even , sometimes , recklessness			1
regardless of the cause , each time a mistake happens , a patient may suffer			1
we fail to uphold our profession 's basic oath : " first , do no harm			2
" according to a 1999 report by the @entity15 , as many as 98,000 @entity16 were dying every year because of medical mistakes			1
today , exact figures are hard to come by because states do n't abide by the same reporting guidelines , and few cases gain as much attention as that of @entity24 , the 12 - year - old boy who died of septic shock this spring after being sent home from a @entity27			1
but a reasonable estimate is that medical mistakes now kill around 200,000 @entity16 every year			1
that would make them one of the leading causes of death in the @entity16			0
why have these mistakes been so hard to prevent ? here 's one theory			1
it is a given that @entity16 doctors perform a staggering number of tests and procedures , far more than in other industrialized nations , and far more than we used to			1
since 1996 , the percentage of doctor visits leading to at least five drugs ' being prescribed has nearly tripled , and the number of mri scans quadrupled			0
certainly many procedures , tests and prescriptions are based on legitimate need			1
in a recent anonymous survey , orthopedic surgeons said 24 % of the tests they ordered were medically unnecessary			0
this kind of treatment is a form of defensive medicine , meant less to protect the patient than to protect the doctor or hospital against potential lawsuits			1
herein lies a stunning irony			0
defensive medicine is rooted in the goal of avoiding mistakes			1
but each additional procedure or test , no matter how cautiously performed , injects a fresh possibility of error			1
@entity70 and mri scans can lead to false positives and unnecessary operations , which carry the risk of complications like infections and bleeding			0
the more medications patients are prescribed , the more likely they are to accidentally overdose or suffer an allergic reaction			0
even routine operations like gallbladder removals require anesthesia , which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke			0
so what do we do to be safer ? many smart people have tackled this question			0
@entity89 at @entity90 developed a checklist shown to bring hospital - acquired infections down to close to zero			0
there are rules against disturbing nurses while they dispense medications and software that warns doctors when patients ' prescriptions will interact badly			1
there are policies designed to empower nurses to confront doctors if they see something wrong , even if a senior doctor is at fault			1
interview with dr. @entity108 on his novel what may be even more important is remembering the limits of our power			1
more — more procedures , more testing , more treatment — is not always better			2
in 1979 , @entity118 , under the pen name dr. @entity118 , published rules for hospitals in his caustically humorous novel , " @entity121			2
" rule no. 13 reads : " the delivery of medical care is to do as much nothing as possible			2
" first , do no harm			0
one place where i have seen these issues addressed is in @entity130 , or @entity131 — a weekly gathering of doctors , off limits to the public , which serves in most hospitals as a forum for the discussion of mistakes , complications , deaths and unusual cases			1
it is a sort of quality - assurance conference where doctors hold one another accountable and learn from one another 's mistakes			1
they are some of the most candid and indelible meetings i have ever attended			2
i will never forget when one of our most talented surgeons operated on the wrong side of someone 's brain			0
the patient was bleeding internally ; everyone was rushing , and someone had hung up the ct scans backward			0
thankfully , the patient survived			0
the distraught doctor spent hours throwing up after the operation			0
after he told the story in our m and m meeting , the hospital implemented a " time out " protocol in the operating room for everyone to stop and agree on what operation would be performed , on what side of the body and whether the correct patient was indeed lying on the operating table , to make sure that kind of mistake would never happen again			2
at my first @entity131 and @entity163 as a medical student , i heard the story of a patient who had received antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection			2
two weeks later she developed joint pain and blisters on her chest and arms , a condition known as @entity188 , which can be caused by an allergic reaction to antibiotics			0
she ended up with sepsis , a body wide infection , and spent two weeks in intensive care			0
she , too , survived , but most stunning was the doctor 's admission that her original ailment had been a mild viral illness — she had n't even needed the antibiotics that led to such a terrible reaction			0
years later , that case still makes me think harder about every test i order and every medication i prescribe			2
hospitals are supposed to take care of the sickest members of our society and uphold the highest standards of patient care			0
but hospitals are also charged with teaching doctors , and every doctor has a first mistake			1
the only thing we can do is learn each time one happens , and reduce future errors in the process			2
having a consistent gathering to talk about the mistakes goes a long way toward that goal , and just about any institution , public or private , could benefit from a tradition like @entity131 and @entity225 it is not enough to stop the practice of defensive medicine , but when doctors are asked by their colleagues to justify the tests they ordered and the procedures they performed , perhaps they will be reminded that more is not always better			1

dr. @entity108 : why is it so hard to prevent medical mistakes that kill *thousands* ?
he says one theory is that doctors order so many procedures to protect themselves
each procedure creates a new *opportunity* for a mistake , he says
he says " *morbidity* and *mortality* " meetings give doctors a chance to learn from mistakes
