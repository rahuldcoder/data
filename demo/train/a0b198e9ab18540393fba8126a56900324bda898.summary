-- the @entity2 's newly released @entity1 confirmed what most of us already knew : the middle class has taken a really big hit			1
between 2007 to 2010 , the typical family had lost nearly 40 % of their wealth			1
and , despite that our economy was 15 % larger in 2010 than in 2001 , the typical family 's wealth decreased by 27.1 % since 2001			1
on top of that , income had fallen			0
median family income in 2010 was down by 7.7 % from its 2007 level and 6.3 % from its level a decade ago			1
the picture looks dismal , does n't it ? but none of these numbers are surprising really			0
is the average @entity24 poorer than before ? yes			1
the @entity2 's survey is picking up on the huge effect of the collapse of the housing bubble			1
for many middle class families , their home is by far their largest financial asset			0
for decades , people were encouraged to believe that it was the safest way to save for retirement or other purposes			0
this clearly was not true when house prices became inflated			0
in the years when the bubble reached levels that were clearly unsustainable , from 2002 to 2007 , housing was just about the worst possible place to keep wealth			1
unfortunately , tens of millions of @entity24 listened to experts such as former @entity2 chairman @entity44 , who assured the country that there was no housing bubble			1
according to reports , @entity44 has a very nice pension and a job that pays more than $ 1 million a year			2
he certainly does n't have to worry like the typical @entity24 family			1
it is difficult to read through the @entity2 survey and not get angry at the wreckage from a completely preventable disaster			1
@entity24 families : how are you coping ? @entity44 could have used his enormous stature to warn of the dangers of buying overvalued houses			1
he could have warned lenders of the risks of issuing mortgages on overvalued property			0
and he could have used the massive research capacities of the @entity2 to document without question the existence of a bubble and the damage that its collapse would cause			1
he also could have used the @entity2 's regulatory power to crack down on the epidemic of mortgage fraud that the @entity74 had highlighted as early as 2004			2
if @entity44 had acted responsibly and taken some of these steps , as some of us have urged at the time , the housing bubble could have been contained before it was too late			1
but if all else failed , he could have raised interest rates			0
to make interest rate hikes more effective , he could have told the markets that he was explicitly targeting the bubble			2
for example , he could have promised to raise rates until nationwide house prices fell back to their 2000 level			0
@entity44 's failure is history now , but we should demand that the @entity2 take asset bubbles more seriously in the future			1
there is nothing more important that the @entity2 can do			2
so , what now ? it should be apparent that housing is not a safe asset , even when we are not in a bubble			2
those who advocate that everyone should be a homeowner are displaying their ignorance			0
homeownership in many markets can be like putting all your savings in your employer 's stock			0
ask an autoworker in @entity111 if this is not clear			0
another important takeaway is that older @entity24 are extremely ill - prepared for retirement			2
the median wealth for families between the ages of 55 to 64 is $ 179,400			2
for families between the ages of 45 to 54 , it is just $ 117,900			0
this is everything they own -- all their savings , retirement accounts and the equity they have in their home			0
the typical retiree in the next two decades will be almost entirely dependent on his or her @entity128 check			0
remarkably , in @entity131 , all the important people think the most pressing matter is finding ways to cut @entity128 and @entity134			0
by detailing the economic slide of the average @entity24 , the @entity2 survey highlights a problem that is becoming increasing clear : growing inequality in our country			1
while most people are hurting badly , the very rich -- whose wealth and income have grown disproportionately big in recent times -- have largely recovered from the downturn			0
americans should not tolerate a society where the rules are rigged to redistribute income upward			1
otherwise , expect to become poorer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity2 released survey showing average family losing 38.8 % of net worth
@entity153 : few surprised that the average @entity24 is poorer than before
he says @entity44 could have tried to contain the housing bubble
@entity153 : americans should not tolerate a society in which wealth inequality widens
