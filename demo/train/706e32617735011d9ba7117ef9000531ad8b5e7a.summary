@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the earth started to shake on january 12 , @entity3 was in his tiny , one - room apartment , composing lyrics for the upcoming carnivale in @entity0			1
he ran out the door to find an entire two - story building , crumbling and falling in his direction			2
i fell down , i was on my back , " he said			2
in heavily - accented @entity15 , peppered with @entity14 slang , @entity3 described how he was all - but buried under the rubble ... and then rescued by members of his hip - hop group			1
" thanks to @entity19 , thanks to my friends , " he said			1
" i 'm so proud it 's them come to save me			1
" @entity3 is better known by his stage name " @entity24			2
" he is a member of a neighborhood hip - hop group called @entity26 , or @entity27 they are six childhood friends from the same poor neighborhood who rap in @entity31			1
@entity24 escaped the earthquake with minor injuries			1
many other residents of his neighborhood were n't so fortunate			2
" two days after the disaster , we [ carried ] 39 dead bodies ... from here to the central cemetery , " said @entity36 , the manager of the band			2
he spoke while standing on a rooftop which offered a view of a devastated urban landscape of collapsed and dangerously sagging cinderblock apartment buildings			2
the members of @entity26 have been forced to abandon their homes in this tightly - packed community of concrete houses and narrow alleyways			1
" it 's too dangerous , nobody wants to live in the houses again , " said @entity36 's younger brother @entity51 , also known as the rapper named " @entity53			1
" he led @entity2 on a tour , past a large wall mural showing @entity60 's name in jagged graffiti , to the sprawling , fetid camp where the band , their families , and some 4,500 other displaced @entity1 now live			1
the artists have helped each other build crude shacks out of plywood and rusting metal sheeting , along a winding dirt alleyway they have playfully nick - named " big man street			2
" twenty - one year old @entity72 , @entity73 , has already decorated the walls of his hut with posters of soccer teams and music groups			1
he said he and three others slept in the tiny room , along with some unwanted visitors			2
" @entity86 ! " he yelled , to peals of laughter from the rest of the group			1
despite the unbearable conditions , spirits among the band 's members appeared remarkably high			1
" if you get angry with it , you get angry at @entity19 , " said the manager , @entity36			2
" we are not more important than those people who are dead			0
@entity19 just leave us alive			0
we thank him for that			0
" perhaps because of this infectious optimism , 25 - year - old " @entity53 " has been appointed the leader of a camp association , representing all 4,500 residents			0
" if i have a problem , i 'll come to him , " said one resident named @entity102			0
" because he is the one that can make the people listen to him			0
" on the day @entity2 visited , @entity53 and about ten other colleagues had just completed construction of a sandbag platform to house a large water bladder and distribution system donated by @entity113 aid organization concern			0
residents with buckets and jugs were already lining up for a taste of fresh water			0
" we want to make the people , the survivors live better , " @entity53 explained			1
he then issued an appeal for other aid organizations to come and help the community			0
" we need something else specially for the children , " he said			0
" we need to make a place for the children for education			0
" three weeks after the earthquake , residents of this camp were stripping away vegetation and small trees from the surrounding area , and the air was thick with the sound of hammers and saws as people worked to construct new ramshackle homes			1
before the earthquake , only one member of @entity26 had a full - time job , working at a juice factory			1
the others were unemployed artists , filming music videos on shoe - string budgets , all victims of @entity1 's impoverished economy			1
since the disaster , these young men have carried corpses , cared for wounded friends and relatives , and become leaders of their displaced and desperate community			1
they are also trying write new lyrics , to explain this life - changing ordeal			2
" this is a revolution of nature , " said @entity162 , who survived the two - story building collapse			0
@entity24 and his colleagues then delivered a memorable a cappella performance amid shelters made of bed sheets and sticks where hungry children wailed			1
" all the parks have become home to most , " he chanted in @entity31 , as the sun set over smoking campfires			0
" we have to mobilize to overcome this crisis			0
hopefully now the system will reboot			0
the time for the people has come			0
solving the problems will take time			0
but we 're not going anywhere			0
we need to deal with this crisis at the grass roots			0
