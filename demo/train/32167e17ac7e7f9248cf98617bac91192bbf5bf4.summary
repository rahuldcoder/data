suffering in the grip of a brutal winter where temperatures have not risen above freezing in nearly a month , @entity0 has seen a wave of deaths related to the cold , and the country 's ambulance service is inundated with calls for help			1
on one recent night , emergency services raced through the streets of the capital , @entity12 , in response to a call about a homeless man passed out in the freezing weather			1
the man got drunk and either fell asleep or dropped unconscious outside , putting him at risk of frostbite			1
@entity20 , a passerby , found him , brought him indoors and called for an ambulance			0
when paramedics arrived , they found the homeless man , who gave his name simply as @entity26 , squatting drunk on the floor			1
his hand was so swollen , he could barely hold his cigarette			0
@entity20 said the man was freezing to death , so he brought him inside			1
" i felt sorry for him			0
but i also did n't want to find a body in the morning , " @entity20 said			0
paramedics determined @entity26 needed emergency hospital care for frostbite , and helped the intoxicated man to his feet			1
@entity26 was so drunk , he could barely walk down the stairs			0
@entity40 : beauty and danger of @entity44 's snow but in a country where the cold has claimed at least 112 lives in the past month -- 90 % of them alcohol - related , according to the government -- @entity26 can consider himself lucky to be alive			1
about 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since january 27 , officials said			1
temperatures remained well below the average thursday , with the mercury falling to -24 degrees @entity57 ( -11.2 degrees @entity56 ) in parts of @entity0			1
authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold - related conditions , and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country , they said			1
the tents are heated , and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks			0
dr. @entity71 , doctor - in - chief at an emergency help station in @entity12 , said many of those suffering from frostbite and hypothermia and some of those who died were alcoholics -- but others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm			1
@entity0 's capital , @entity12 , has more than 14,000 homeless people , among the most vulnerable to winter 's bitter chill , authorities said			1
" it is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances -- it may be why they are homeless in the first place , " said @entity85 , a spokesman for the @entity86 in @entity44			1
" alcohol creates the illusion of being warm , so it 's not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out , " he said , adding that this is when hypothermia can occur			1
" our approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink , if we can find them and get them to safety			2
obviously , a full belly or hot drinks is far , far better for you than vodka			0
" @entity86 volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing , boots , hot food and drinks in the @entity0 and elsewhere , @entity85 said from @entity112			1
but , he added , the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate			0
" these people are outside the normal safety nets , difficult to find , and do n't realize the great danger they are in			0
" @entity12 marked its 25th consecutive day of below - freezing temperatures thursday			2
it would normally expect a high of -2 degrees @entity57 ( 28 degrees @entity56 ) at this time of year , @entity121 meteorologist @entity120 said			0
and there is little respite in sight for those suffering in the unusual cold			2
another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of @entity131 into the rest of @entity44 for the end of the week , with @entity134 and @entity44 catching the brunt of the coldest air			0
the cities of @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 saw their coldest mornings so far this winter thursday , with temperatures dipping to -24 degrees @entity57 ( -11.2 degrees @entity56 ) in the @entity143 and @entity144 capitals and -19 degrees @entity57 ( -2.2 degrees @entity56 ) in @entity140 , the capital of @entity145			0
the region can expect below freezing temperatures through the weekend , @entity121 meteorologist @entity146 said			2
parts of the @entity149 , one of the most important rivers in @entity44 for commerce , have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years , showing not only the intensity of the cold snap , but also its longevity			2
at least four countries have halted shipping along sections of the 1,700 mile - long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels ' hulls , @entity157 said , adding that the river is not only used for transport but for drinking water , irrigation and tourism			2
areas along the @entity174 coast have also frozen over , she added			0
@entity175 can also expect more cold as the week ends , with snow forecast in many parts of @entity178 and @entity179 overnight thursday to friday			2
the sustained cold spell is putting a strain on power providers across the region			2
@entity184 announced wednesday it would fall back on its energy reserves and restart several fossil - fuel power stations that have been dormant for some time			2
a combination of below freezing temperatures , insufficient yields from renewable energy sources , and interruptions to natural gas imports from @entity131 have aggravated a discrepancy in energy production left behind by @entity196 's decision last year to rid @entity184 of nuclear power			0
@entity184 decided to phase out all nuclear energy in the wake of the meltdown at @entity203 's @entity202 nuclear plant , triggered by an earthquake and tsunami			0
a spokeswoman from @entity184 's @entity207 , the government body responsible for the country 's electricity and gas infrastructure , said that when eight nuclear reactors were taken off line last year , the ability of @entity184 's four network providers to compensate for unexpected interruptions in service was affected			0
the energy supply situation is especially tense in the south because that is where much of the country 's industry is concentrated , she added			0
the cold snap has raised questions over @entity44 's reliance on @entity131 for gas as supplies sent via @entity0 have dipped below the expected levels			1
@entity0 energy minister @entity230 said electricity consumption in the country is historically high			1
but in an interview with @entity121 , he rejected suggestions that @entity0 has been siphoning off gas as it transits from @entity131 to @entity44			1
@entity236 , @entity131 's gas monopoly , has denied sending lower volumes of gas to @entity44			0
at least 250 people have died across the region in the cold weather .			0
