@entity0 -- president @entity2 gave a nod to @entity5 's heartland tuesday , saying in an interview conducted during halftime of an @entity9 basketball game in @entity10 he wanted to show his @entity13 counterpart , @entity12 , a part of @entity5 rarely seen by foreign visitors			1
" i thought it was going to be wonderful for the prime minister to have a chance not only to see a basketball game for first time , but also to come to the great state of @entity10 , because sometimes when we have foreign visitors , they only see the coasts , they go to @entity26 , they go to @entity0 , they go to @entity27 , but you know the heartland is what it 's all about , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 's hat tip to @entity10 , and his choice of venue , may not be pure coincidence -- @entity10 is historically a key swing state in presidential elections			2
@entity12 and @entity2 flew together on @entity36 to @entity37 , @entity10 , to take in an opening game of the @entity9 basketball tournament			1
@entity2 , well - known as a basketball fan , was treating @entity12 to a little @entity41 , and the pair conducted the joint television interview at halftime of the game between @entity46 and @entity47			1
asked how he thought the teams were playing , @entity2 replied candidly			2
" both teams are shooting terribly , " @entity2 said			2
" it may be nerves			0
these are not teams that normally end up coming to the tournament			0
" @entity12 , asked how he was enjoying watching his first basketball game , said he was " enjoying it , " and that @entity2 was explaining the ins - and - outs of the @entity5 sport			1
" he was giving me some tips , " @entity12 said			0
" he 's going to help me fill out my bracket			0
" @entity12 's trip to the @entity5 is intended to demonstrate that ties between the countries remain as close as ever			0
the @entity64 labeled @entity12 's visit -- which started tuesday and will include meetings with president @entity2 followed by lunch and dinner at the @entity64 on wednesday -- an official one , not a state one			1
that 's because the label of state visit is reserved for heads of state , and @entity12 is the head of government			0
@entity75 is the head of state			0
however , the @entity64 statement said @entity12 would attend a state dinner wednesday night , the sixth of the @entity2 administration so far			1
" the fact that we are hosting the prime minister in the manner that we are demonstrates the nature of the relationship between our two countries ; the fact that it is a special relationship , " @entity64 press secretary @entity87 told reporters tuesday			1
on wednesday , @entity12 and @entity2 will hold talks at the @entity64 and address a joint news conference , followed by lunch and , later , the @entity64 dinner with full diplomatic trappings and toasts			1
@entity12 and his wife , @entity96 , will leave @entity0 on thursday			0
" the visit will highlight the fundamental importance of the @entity5 - @entity13 special relationship and the depth of the friendship between the @entity5 people and the people of the @entity13 , as well as the strong personal bond that has developed between the two leaders and their families , " a @entity64 statement said			1
topics expected to come up at wednesday 's meetings include the coming @entity111 and @entity112 summits , as well as @entity113 , the @entity114 , @entity115 and the global economy , according to the @entity64			2
in a joint op - ed published tuesday in the @entity118 , @entity2 and @entity12 emphasized the global benefits of the strong alliance between their nations			2
" the alliance between the @entity5 and @entity125 is a partnership of the heart , bound by the history , traditions and values we share , " the two leaders wrote			0
" but what makes our relationship special -- a unique and essential asset -- is that we join hands across so many endeavors			0
put simply , we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance			0
" troops and citizens of the two countries " have long shown what can be achieved when @entity13 and @entity5 work together , heart and hand , and why this remains an essential relationship -- to our nations and the world , " the commentary by @entity2 and @entity12 said			1
@entity1 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
