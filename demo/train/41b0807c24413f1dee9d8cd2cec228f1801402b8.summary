the spokesman for the @entity3 , @entity4 , police department is on unpaid leave and facing disciplinary action after reportedly describing the memorial honoring @entity8 as a " pile of trash " in an interview with the @entity12 , the city has announced			1
the newspaper quoted officer @entity14 after the memorial -- flowers , stuffed animals and other items in the street near where @entity8 was killed in a police shooting -- was destroyed on @entity22			1
" i do n't know that a crime has occurred , " the newspaper quoted him as saying friday			0
" but a pile of trash in the middle of the street ? the @entity12 is making a call over this ? " @entity31 radio station @entity30 later reported that @entity14 told its reporter he had been misquoted and actually said that the memorial might have been destroyed by a motorist unfamiliar with the area who had mistaken it for a pile of trash			1
but in its saturday night statement , the city said " the officer admitted to @entity44 investigators that he did in fact make the remarks attributed to him , and that he misled his superiors when asked about the contents of the interview			1
" it 's relatively unusual for government officials to comment on employee disciplinary issues , but anything involving the @entity8 case is far from routine			2
@entity8 died august 9 after being shot by officer @entity57 in a brief encounter that provoked protests across the nation before and after a grand jury declined to bring charges in the case			0
the shooting sharply divided @entity64 between those who sided with @entity57 and other police officers as heroes patrolling dangerous streets , and those who argued too many officers bring an overbearing posture and quick - to - shoot mindset to largely @entity73 communities			0
nowhere has that tension been greater than @entity3 , where the largely white police force has faced harsh criticism over poor relations with the city 's predominantly black population			2
city officials have pledged to improve that relationship , and took pains to note police chief @entity84 kept investigating the statement even after @entity14 initially denied making it			1
" @entity89 of @entity3 wants to emphasize that negative remarks about the @entity8 memorial do not reflect the feelings of the @entity44 and are in direct contradiction to the efforts of @entity89 officials to relocate the memorial to a more secure location , " the city said in its statement			0
in september , the memorial burned in what police said appeared to be an accident caused by burning candles , but which also raised suspicions in the area			0
