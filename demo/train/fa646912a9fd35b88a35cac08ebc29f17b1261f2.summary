the 145 - page report from the @entity14 's inspector general noted isolated cases of unethical conduct among @entity6 workers , on or off duty , that raised broader security concerns			1
it recommended 14 guidelines to deal with future problems			0
the agency whose mission includes protecting the president and visiting world leaders came under embarrassing scrutiny after revelations last year that some of its employees allegedly consorted with prostitutes before president @entity35 's trip to the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" disciplinary and security clearance cases show that , while not widespread , @entity6 should continue to monitor and address excessive alcohol consumption and personal conduct within its workforce , " said the report			1
" @entity6 is planning to identify and address trends in misconduct through the new position of chief integrity officer			1
" more than 24 people were eventually linked to the scandal , from both the @entity6 and the military			1
nine of the @entity6 members resigned or were being forced out , and three others were cleared of serious misconduct			1
they were part of a contingent of hundreds of @entity59 security personnel who arrived early to prepare for the april 2012 summit			0
@entity6 officials later testified the behavior was isolated and did not reflect an inherent culture of recklessness or lack of supervision			1
the inspector general 's report concluded the same			0
" we did not find any evidence that @entity6 leadership has fostered an environment that tolerates inappropriate behavior			2
" parts of the report were blacked out , including complete details of an apparently newly revealed incident from 2010 , similar to the one in @entity38			1
investigators said allegations against an agent were not thoroughly investigated			0
" we identified one case that highlights how the combination of managerial discretion and weak internal controls affected multiple areas of the misconduct adjudication process			0

" this report exposes long - standing problems with @entity6 management , " said rep. @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , the ranking member of the @entity119			1
" the inspector general has revealed what we already knew -- that the @entity6 does not have standardized practices in place for handling employee misconduct and discipline			2
the lack of consistent policy has led to an agency culture dominated by personalities instead of rules			0
" another alleged incident revealed last month has prompted further internal scrutiny			0
two @entity6 supervisors on president @entity35 's protective detail are being investigated for alleged misconduct , a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the internal agency investigation told @entity1 's @entity144			1
