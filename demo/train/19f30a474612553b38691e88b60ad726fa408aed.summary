-- it is when talking about her own children or grandchildren that @entity5 chokes up with emotion , when the pain of her husband 's conviction for sexually abusing young boys rises to the surface			1
" we kept it from the kids as long as we could because we did not know what was going to happen , " said @entity5 , fighting back tears in an interview with @entity0 's @entity14			1
" and that was really hard			0
we had to tell the kids , and the kids questioned their dad			0
and the kids talked to him and he told them and they believe their dad			0
" to @entity5 , the boys her husband @entity25 was convicted of sexually molesting were manipulated			1
she blames a vast conspiracy , which included the media , for the conviction that sent the 70 - year - old former @entity32 assistant football coach to prison on a 30 - to 60 - year sentence			1
@entity35 , who was convicted in 2012 on 45 counts , has maintained his innocence			1
the toll on the children in @entity5 clan , however , seems to preoccupy his wife the most			1
" it 's been tough on our family , " she said			2
" two of our kids have lost their jobs during this time ... our granddkids , some of them are older , old enough to understand what has gone on , and they know who their pop is , what people are saying that he is			0
but they know who he is			0
it 's been really hard on them			2
" the @entity60 trial featured the testimony of eight young men who said they were sexually abused by @entity5 -- either groped in a car , soaped by him in the shower or sexually assaulted on a basement waterbed			2
" it was n't like he just took boys and took them to the shower , " @entity5 said			2
" it was when he would work them out , and they would shower and it 's a public place			2
i mean , there 's people that come and go in the locker room all the time			2
" asked whether she was deluding herself or unwilling to accept the truth , she said : " i 'm not that kind of a person and i believe he 's innocent , and if i did n't believe he was innocent , i would not stand by him			2
" @entity5 ' was found guilty before trial , ' @entity5 says the scandal gripped the nation and ended a torturous chapter for the victims and @entity32 's vaunted football program -- including the dismissal of the late legendary coach @entity92 and one of @entity95 's highest - paid university presidents , @entity96			1
it also tarnished @entity32 's celebrated reputation in collegiate athletics and erased part of the @entity102 ' impressive record under @entity92 from the annals of football history			1
@entity105 , a @entity5 family confidant and documentary filmmaker , believes @entity32 administrators railroaded @entity92 by firing him in the wake of the scandal and making it virtually impossible for @entity5 to have a fair trial			1
" when @entity92 was fired , it is a nuclear explosion that goes through the landscape of this case , " @entity105 told @entity0			0
" and because of that , @entity35 loses all presumption of innocence			1
" at the trial of her husband of 37 years , @entity5 testified that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual in the basement of their home , where many of the victims say her husband molested them			1
the couple 's adopted son , @entity126 , originally denied to a grand jury being abused , but later told his attorney that he , too , was a victim			2
in the police interview , @entity126 said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15 , that he tried to escape from the home and once attempted suicide			0
@entity126 , who was 18 when he was adopted , had earlier spent time with them in foster care			0
" i do n't know whether somebody talked to him , or whether he saw money , " @entity5 said of their adopted son 's change of story			1
asked whether she wanted to reconcile with her adopted son , @entity5 -- again referring to the family children -- said amid tears : " i would like to talk to @entity146 i really miss seeing his kids			1
they were a part of our lives			0
and , the hurt that they must be going through			0
i would love to talk to @entity126 just to see why and what			0
" she previously disputed his credibility , referring to @entity126 's " many run - ins with the law " in a letter to the judge who was about to sentence her husband in october 2012			1
" @entity126 is extremely disappointed that @entity5 and the @entity167 have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from @entity35 's heinous crimes , " his lawyers , @entity164 and @entity165 , said in a statement to @entity0 at the time			1
" @entity126 has shown tremendous courage and strength			0
rather than supporting her son when he made the gut - wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of @entity35 , @entity5 has chosen to continue @entity25 's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims , thereby perpetuating the abuse			1
" lawyers for two victims recently responded to @entity5 's latest comments			1
" mrs. @entity5 is our best recent example of our deep denial of the reality of child sex abuse , " attorney @entity195 " never underestimate the ability of a pedophile to charm and deceive the adults around him or her			1
" attorney @entity196 said , " @entity197 ( ie ) @entity5 , like her husband , remains remarkably unremorseful towards @entity35 's victims			1
one significant and noticeable difference is her dramatic shift from her cold and detached demeanor as a witness for her husband at his criminal trial to an emotional and distraught spouse , which appears to my eye to be an attempt to convey a sympathetic image for herself and husband -- a child molester convicted by overwhelming evidence			2
" since the trial , 26 men have settled claims with @entity32 totaling $ 59.7 million in connection with the @entity5 scandal , the university announced last fall			1
a few other claims have not yet been settled			0
" i think that they could be manipulated by people , " @entity5 said			2
" i think a lot of them had financial problems			0
i just do n't believe their stories			0
" at least every week , she visits her husband in his southwestern @entity60 prison			0
" he 's in his cell 23 hours a day , monday through friday , " @entity5 told @entity0			1
" and then on weekends its 24 hours			0
we talk about what he 's doing in prison , what has happened			0
and i try to cheer him up , but he ends up cheering me up instead of me cheering him up			0
" during the interview , @entity5 showed @entity0 's @entity14 the basement room of the @entity239 , @entity60 , home where some of the victims said they were abused			2
one accuser said his muffled screams went unheard by her upstairs			0
" i would have heard it , yes , " she said of his screams for help			0
@entity5 was read part of letter her husband wrote to @entity0			2
it said , " my biggest hope at the moment is that somehow people will realize how unfair everything was and that judges will have the courage to examine everything			0
" she said : " i believe @entity259 has a purpose and some purpose will come out of this , that he will see us through			0
" @entity32 's record number of sex offense reports spurs federal inquiry victim 9 sues @entity32 @entity0 's @entity14 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			1
