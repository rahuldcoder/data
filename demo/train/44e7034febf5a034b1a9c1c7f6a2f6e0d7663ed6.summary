-- after just two hours and three minutes , @entity1 stepped off the grass of @entity4 's new no. 3 court a very relieved man on tuesday			1
this time last year it took the @entity8 three days to win his record - breaking clash with @entity10 on court no. 18 in the longest match in tennis history , lasting just over 11 hours			1
somehow fate conspired to have the duo drawn together again in the opening round , and the sporting world was watching to see if the agony would be repeated			0
that 2010 epic went to five sets , with the eight - hour decider won 70 - 68 by @entity1			2
this time , however , @entity1 triumphed 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) before daylight faded to earn a second - round meeting with @entity26 16th seed @entity24			1
@entity28 , @entity27 through to round two " it was n't easy but obviously it was considerably quicker than last time			0
i was happy how i played , especially in the third set , " the 26 - year - old told reporters			1
" i was thinking if i lost that set we probably would n't be able to finish , and then it would have been the match going into a second day and people would have been talking about maybe a third			0
" i 'm glad they put us out on this court			0
i do n't know if they wanted to tarnish the memory of what happened on @entity43			0
it was unlikely it would live up to that match			0
it 's a huge relief			0
" after the first set went to a tie - break , it looked as if another titanic serving battle was on the cards			0
but @entity1 broke the @entity53 in the fourth and sixth games of the second set , winning it in just 26 minutes			2
@entity10 had the chance to reduce the deficit after breaking in the third game of the third set , but @entity1 repaid the favor and had the edge in the tie - break to win it in 50 minutes			1
by comparison , last year 's match featured 215 aces to 16 this time , 490 winners to 72 , 91 unforced errors to 26 , and 980 points played to 201			2
it was 47th - ranked @entity1 's first match since losing a five - set thriller to world no. 1 @entity73 in the first round of the @entity75 last month , where @entity10 fell at the same hurdle			1
@entity1 will hope he has more in reserve for his second - round match than last year at @entity4 , where he predictably wilted in straights sets against @entity81 @entity80 after his marathon effort .			1

@entity1 and @entity10 clash again in repeat of longest match in tennis history
@entity8 wins again , this time in nine fewer hours in first - round match
the 26 - year - old triumphs 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) before daylight fades
he earns a second - round meeting with @entity26 16th seed @entity24
