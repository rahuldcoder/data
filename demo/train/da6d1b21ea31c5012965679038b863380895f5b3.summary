@entity0 -- the @entity2 said friday it will respond to questions from @entity4 on the use of @entity2 aircraft amid allegations that attorney general @entity8 is among officials who " may have used @entity2 planes for his own travel when aircraft were needed for @entity2 operations			1
" both the @entity15 and the @entity16 confirmed fbi director @entity17 himself intends to reply to the allegations			1
a letter to @entity17 from key congressional republicans in the @entity22 and @entity16 said thursday that in one case , @entity8 is alleged to have reserved an @entity2 aircraft , " upgraded to a larger aircraft owned by a different agency and left the @entity2 plane sitting idle because he failed to notify the @entity2 in a timely manner			1
" the letter from sens. @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 , @entity34 , was also signed by powerful @entity36 chairman @entity35 of @entity37 and @entity39 chairman @entity38 of @entity40			2
in may , @entity31 asked @entity17 , who was testifying on @entity41 , if the @entity2 had to lease a plane because the bureau 's jet was reserved for top @entity15 officials			1
@entity17 responded : " the attorney general , the @entity15 , the @entity2 , understand that these planes are first for investigative work , " @entity17 said			1
" they are used for counterterrorism , criminal cases , and that any travel of the principals is secondary to the use of the plane for the investigative work of the @entity2			2
" the answer was not sufficient for @entity31 and his colleagues			0
the lawmakers want to know why the @entity2 pays for @entity8 's travel , even when he uses @entity61 planes such as @entity62 or @entity64 aircraft			1
among several other demands , the lawmakers want the @entity2 to list all flights billed to the @entity2 by the @entity15 , and whether all of those flights were for official or personal travel			2
the letter , apparently coincidentally , was sent to @entity17 on the day the @entity71 highlighted what it called " @entity8 's world tour			1
" the @entity71 noted that @entity8 is planning a trip to the @entity76			0
he has already traveled this summer on official business to @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
the article notes the attorney general appears to have itineraries packed full of official meetings , so he has little time for sightseeing			0
the expenses associated with the travel of attorneys general and other top government officials is an oft - debated topic in @entity0			0
frequently , the party out of power or its allies complain about the cost to taxpayers for official travel			0
@entity8 's predecessor , @entity100 , who served under president @entity101 , was also questioned about his travel expenses			1
one of the major issues is the government 's requirement that for security reasons , attorneys general , @entity108 secretaries , @entity2 directors , and many defense and civilian intelligence officials must fly in government aircraft			2
when these officials travel on personal business they must reimburse the government at the rate of a round trip coach fare			0
the cost of a round trip coach fare between @entity0 and @entity122 , for example costs about $ 130 , while the actual cost of operating a government plane to and from @entity122 to @entity0 is more than $ 4,000			0
the taxpayers pay the difference .			0
