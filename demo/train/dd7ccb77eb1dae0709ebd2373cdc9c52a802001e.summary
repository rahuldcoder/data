@entity0 -- what had been speculated before is now very public -- the @entity3 and @entity4 differ on how to deal with @entity6 's nuclear ambitions			1
while both governments reject any possibility of a nuclear - armed @entity6 , they are clearly at odds over a possible agreement as soon as this week that would loosen economic sanctions against @entity14 in exchange for a suspension of part of its nuclear program			1
president @entity19 said tuesday that he did n't know if what he called an interim agreement with @entity6 could be reached , but he said the goal was to ensure @entity6 gave up any ambitions to develop nuclear weapons			1
the negotiations would buy time so " we could see if they could get to the end state of a position where we , the @entity4 and the international community could say @entity6 's not seeking a nuclear weapon , " @entity19 told business leaders at a @entity34 forum			1
however , @entity4 prime minister @entity35 rejects the agreement sought by @entity3 secretary of state @entity37 at the international talks that resume wednesday in @entity39			1
" it 's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal , " @entity35 told @entity1 on sunday			1
in a sign of the level of disconnect , the two countries were unable to agree on when @entity37 would next travel to @entity4 for talks with @entity35 on the @entity6 issue			1
@entity35 said sunday that @entity37 would meet with him on friday , but @entity37 told reporters monday he would be unable to make the trip so soon			0
the split involves international diplomacy and domestic political issues in both countries , and comes as @entity37 and @entity19 also push @entity35 to work with @entity54 officials on forging a @entity56 peace agreement			2
while @entity35 and @entity19 have long acknowledged that close friends can disagree on issues , the direct language on both sides about their differences over a possible agreement with @entity6 shows the volatility of an issue with major regional and global implications			1
@entity6 insists it seeks to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes			0
the international community led by @entity4 , the @entity3 , @entity69 and others demands that @entity14 dismantle its ability to enrich uranium and other technology needed to develop nuclear weapons			2
on tuesday , @entity6 foreign minister @entity75 accused @entity4 of wanting to " torpedo " an agreement on his country 's nuclear program			1
" we have reason to be suspicious of every move they make , " he said at a news conference in @entity81 , adding that " every move they make is about spreading tension and mistrust			0
" in the @entity1 interview sunday , @entity35 made clear he opposes lifting some sanctions now -- as called for under the agreement being negotiated -- without getting further concessions to ensure @entity6 would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps			1
" i think you should not only keep up the pressure ; i think you should increase the pressure , because it 's finally working , " @entity35 said , labeling @entity6 's economy as close to paralysis			1
" if you give it up now , when you have that pressure , and @entity6 does n't even take apart , dismantle one centrifuge , what leverage will you have when you 've eased the pressure ? " @entity107 : now is time to make deal with @entity6 on nuclear program at the same time , @entity35 repeated his insistence that @entity4 " always reserves the right to defend itself against any threat , " which is diplomat - speak for a military strike on @entity6 's nuclear facilities to stop development of a weapon			1
in @entity121 , some legislators , including conservative @entity119 and @entity120 , share the concerns of @entity35 and the powerful @entity124 lobby in @entity0			0
on tuesday , a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with @entity6 under discussion and only accept an agreement that better dismantles @entity6 's ability to develop nuclear weapons			1
in a letter to @entity37 , the senators -- democrats @entity135 of @entity136 , @entity137 of @entity138 and @entity139 of @entity140 , and republicans @entity141 of @entity143 , @entity144 of @entity145 and @entity146 of @entity147 -- said any easing of sanctions " should require @entity6 to roll back its nuclear program more significantly than now envisioned			2
" " it is our belief that any interim agreement with the @entity6 should bring us closer to our ultimate goal which is @entity6 without a nuclear weapons capability , " the letter said			0
@entity19 later noted that the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced @entity6 to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue			1
the interim deal under discussion in @entity39 would " open up the spigot a little bit " on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving @entity6 oil exports and banking , he said			1
" let 's test the proposition over the next six months that we can resolve this in a diplomatic fashion while maintaining the central architecture of the sanctions , " @entity19 continued			2
at the same time , he emphasized that all options , including military strikes on @entity6 's nuclear facilities , remained on the table as far as the @entity3 was concerned			1
at the @entity185 , spokesman @entity184 said tuesday that " no daylight " exists between the @entity3 and @entity4 on the end goal of preventing @entity6 from developing nuclear weapons			2
@entity37 told reporters monday that @entity35 had " every right in the world " to state his position and defend his interests			0
a former @entity3 senator , he noted that he had been a consistent supporter of " our friends in @entity4 " throughout his political career , and added that " i can assure those friends and everybody watching this that nothing that we are doing here , in my judgment , will put @entity4 at any additional risk			0
" @entity144 calls @entity37 ' a human wrecking ball ' on @entity6 negotiations the @entity39 talks involve @entity6 and the five permanent members of the @entity210 -- the @entity3 , @entity107 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity69 -- as well as @entity213 in what is known as the @entity215 in diplomatic shorthand			1
according to a senior @entity3 administration official , the talks are " getting close " to an interim deal with @entity6 that would prevent its nuclear program " from advancing , and roll it back " in key areas			2
the last round of negotiations broke up without a deal earlier this month , with each side blaming the other 's reluctance			0
a key issue is enrichment of uranium , which is necessary at different levels for both power production and developing nuclear weapons			0
@entity6 says it has the right to enrich its own uranium , while the @entity3 and its allies reject enrichment as a right of nations			0
" we 've long said that certainly we 're open to discussing a peaceful program , " @entity241 spokeswoman @entity240 said tuesday , adding that no right to enrich uranium exists under existing international agreements			0
@entity19 met tuesday with @entity251 leaders as well as the top @entity120 and @entity119 on the @entity252 , @entity247 , @entity248 and intelligence committees to provide an update on the @entity215 negotiations heading into the next round later this week			0
after the meeting , @entity256 sen. @entity256 of @entity257 told reporters he remains concerned that the @entity3 and its allies might be about to give away too much to @entity6 , although he cautioned that an agreement this week in @entity39 remains uncertain			2
" i think you had some folks in the room who were satisfied			0
i think you had some folks in the room who were very unsatisfied , " @entity256 said , adding that any @entity251 action on additional sanctions or other measures involving @entity6 would occur only after the coming @entity269 break			0
last week , @entity37 told a @entity251 panel that new sanctions imposed on @entity6 by @entity121 now " could be viewed as bad faith " in the negotiations			2
" it could destroy the ability to be able to get agreement , " he added , " and it could actually wind up setting us back in dialogue that 's taken 30 years to achieve			0
" @entity6 president @entity281 , who was elected earlier this year , has made lifting tough economic sanctions against his country a priority			0
during a visit to the @entity287 in september , @entity281 's moderate diplomatic approach raised hopes in the @entity289 of a thaw in relations with @entity14 and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program			0
@entity281 's visit culminated in a phone call with @entity19 and a meeting between @entity37 and his @entity6 counterpart			2
it was the first such high - level contact between the two nations since @entity6 's 1979 revolution			2
@entity6 recently signed a deal with the @entity303 that agrees to give the @entity210 nuclear watchdog agency access to long - unseen nuclear sites , including a heavy - water reactor in @entity307			0
on tuesday , @entity311 prime minister @entity310 called @entity281 to talk about this week 's @entity39 talks and other issues , @entity310 's @entity309 office announced , adding it was the first such call in more than a decade			1
a @entity309 spokesman said on traditional condition of not being identified that " both leaders agreed that significant progress had been made in the recent @entity39 negotiations and that it was important to seize the opportunity presented by the further round of talks which get under way tomorrow			0
" " the prime minister underlined the necessity of @entity6 comprehensively addressing the concerns of the international community about their nuclear program , including the need for greater transparency " the spokesman said			1
@entity1 's @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 and @entity341 contributed to this report .			0
