-- president @entity1 is probably the most pro-woman president in @entity3 history , but his signature racial justice program , the @entity6 initiative , is for males only			1
that 's wrong and needs to change			2
the president should follow the advice of more than 1,000 women of color who , this week , wrote a letter to urge him to include the sisters as well as the brothers			2
the women include civil rights icons @entity19 and @entity21 , movie stars @entity22 and @entity24 , and writers @entity25 and @entity27			2
the signers also include schoolgirls , working - class women and , i 'm proud to say , my 70 - year - old mother , a retired schoolteacher , and my sister , a stay - at - home mom of two teenage boys			2
my mom , @entity36 , is @entity1 's biggest fan			1
but she says she did n't march with @entity37 to get the " whites only " signs taken down , only to have the nation 's first black president put up a sign that says " men only			1
" there 's a myth that girls of color are doing better than boys			1
but that 's not supported by the facts			2
indeed the @entity52 website attempts to justify @entity6 's exclusion of females by stating that " boys of color are too often born into poverty and live with a single parent			1
" but do n't @entity60 - @entity60 girls live in the same single - parent households as @entity60 boys ? do n't @entity64 girls attend the same failing schools as @entity64 boys ? is n't a teenage girl on a reservation in @entity69 as afraid of being a victim of rape as a teenage boy in @entity73 is afraid of being a victim of gun violence ? indeed @entity60 and @entity64 women are the poorest members of our society			1
according to a study by the @entity82 reported on @entity83 , the average net worth of a white woman is $ 41,000			0
compare that to $ 100 for black women , and $ 120 for @entity86			0
although @entity60 - @entity60 men are , generally speaking , not doing well either , they earn more money than @entity60 - @entity60 women , and are less likely to be raising children on poverty - level wages			2
the average net worth of an unmarried black man is 100 times greater than that of an unmarried black woman			0
but this is not about a race to the bottom			0
it is about understanding that the economic and social conditions that prevent many people of color from achieving the @entity105 do not discriminate on the basis of gender			1
and neither should @entity1 's most important race - based program to remedy these conditions			1
community organizations , many now strapped for cash , stand to receive millions of dollars from @entity6			1
unless the initiative expands to include women , these groups are likely to orient their programs to where the money is by , for example , restricting job training , college preparation and mentoring to boys only			1
as a result of @entity6 , federal agencies are being asked to collect data about how their operations impact minority males			1
unless the mission of this initiative is expanded , the data about girls apparently will be sent to the shredding bin			1
it 's an ironic result for an administration that prides itself on its support for women 's equality			0
first lady @entity137 spoke movingly at @entity139 's memorial service about how desperately she , as a black girl growing up in @entity73 , needed to hear @entity139 's message of empowerment , " when there were such stifling limitations on how black women could exist in the world			0
" now the president has the ability to help more women of color have the opportunities -- to grow up healthy and safe , to go to college , to live their dreams -- that his wife had			0
i am an @entity60 man who stood outside in the cold at both of @entity1 's inaugurations and sang " @entity160 " louder than i ever had before			1
the president frequently says that he does n't have all the answers			0
for example , at the beginning of his administration he thought civil unions were good enough for same - sex couples			0
now @entity1 thanks the lgbt community for helping him evolve to support marriage equality			1
one day the president will express the same kind of gratitude to the women of color who petitioned him this week to make @entity6 more inclusive			1
he has said this initiative is " as important as anything i will do as president			0
" so we need him to get it right			0
a racial justice program simply will not work if it leaves out half the race			1
too many girls of color are barely staying afloat in the same deep tides that threaten the boys			0
@entity6 is like a ship that comes along to throw a lifeline only to the boys			2
the message is to the girls is , " wait			0
there might be another boat for you at some later time			0
" but the truth is that the girls ca n't swim any better than the boys			2
the sisters need someone to keep them as desperately as the brothers			0
join us on @entity204 / @entity203 .			0

@entity206 *wonders* why @entity1 's signature initiative does n't include girls
my @entity6 program offers young men social and economic opportunities
