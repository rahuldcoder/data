-- earlier this week , @entity1 issued the seventh issue of @entity3 , a glossy @entity4 - language online magazine that emerged as a mouthpiece for the preaching of now - dead @entity9 - @entity8 terrorist cleric @entity7			1
the message the magazine emphasized most was that supporters of @entity1 in the @entity13 should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves			1
a dedicated section provided them practical advice with how to carry out such attacks in the @entity13			0
it was a publication that caused great concern to counterterrorism officials on both sides of the @entity24			0
distributed widely on jihadist websites , forums , and blogs , not only did the magazine attract a following in the @entity9 and the @entity29 , but also in several @entity31 countries like @entity32			1
but it is possible that the seventh issue will be its last , with news that @entity36 , its @entity9 @entity37 - born editor , was also killed in the airstrike targeting @entity7			1
drone strike killed senior @entity1 cleric @entity36 left @entity41 for @entity8 in october 2009 , according to @entity9 officials , and had become radicalized while previously living in the @entity44 area of @entity45			1
even while living in the @entity9 , @entity36 had attracted significant attention for publishing a blog sympathetic to @entity1			1
the loss of @entity7 and @entity36 is likely to significantly curtail @entity1 's @entity4 propaganda output , one of the factors , according to @entity9 counterterrorism officials , behind increased radicalization in the @entity9 in recent years			1
" they 're presenting a message in @entity4 which automatically increases the accessibility to an @entity9 audience , " @entity54 , the @entity56 's director of intelligence analysis told @entity0 in an interview in 2010			1
@entity1 still has one highly visible @entity4 - language propagandist : @entity63 - born convert @entity64 , who over the past half decade has recorded many tapes in and around the @entity68 - @entity67 border region , where he is still believed to be operating			1
@entity64 , like @entity7 , has urged @entity70 supporters to launch attacks on behalf of @entity1 in the @entity13			1
for example in an @entity1 video released in june titled " you are only responsible for yourself , " @entity64 said it is easy for @entity9 @entity1 sympathizers to go to a gun show and purchase an automatic assault rifle without having to submit to a background check			1
also , @entity80 , a @entity37 - born @entity9 who left for jihad a decade ago , is believed to have taken on a senior role for @entity1 , allegedly helping to orchestrate a plot to bomb @entity45 subways in september 2009			1
but he has yet to appear in any @entity1 videotapes or other propaganda output			2
@entity87 will tell if @entity1 decide to push @entity80 into a more visible role			1
but @entity64 and @entity80 have nothing like @entity7 's religious knowledge or following in militant @entity92 circles in the @entity13			2
before @entity7 joined forces with @entity1 in @entity8 about three years ago , he built up a large mainstream following in the @entity9 and the @entity29 because of his charisma and his ability to transmit religious teaching in a vernacular young @entity98 could understand			1
when he preached in mosques and meeting halls in @entity29 on visits from @entity8 in the early to middle 2000s , there was often standing room only , according to those present , and he reached a much bigger audience worldwide by recording his sermons onto dvds and making them available on the @entity109			2
in smaller gatherings in @entity29 during this period , @entity7 's message could be much more radical			2
" behind closed doors i was told he conducted study groups which justified suicide bombing , for example , against the @entity13 -- justified suicide bombings against civilians , " @entity113 , a @entity29 imam , told @entity0 's @entity114 in 2009			2
@entity113 , at whose mosque in east @entity123 once preached in 2002 , recalled that that @entity7 at the time did not explicitly preach a message of violence , but his anti-american message and charisma were dangerous because they left congregations " all revved up , not knowing what to do			0
" more than any other factor , it was @entity7 's popularity in mainstream @entity98 circles before he joined forces with @entity1 that made him such a dangerous voice for the group in the past two years , a young @entity29 muslim who has seen his impact firsthand told @entity0			1
his previous popularity allowed him to play the role of a " spiritual sanctioner " for @entity70 radicals deliberating whether to launch attacks , for example for alleged @entity149 shooter maj. @entity148 , who exchanged @entity109 message with him			0
a recent case in the @entity29 perhaps best illustrated the power of @entity7 's message			2
@entity153 , a @entity29 - @entity154 woman jailed for life last november for attempting in may 2010 to stab to death a @entity29 member of @entity158 for supporting the @entity160 war , was radicalized by watching more than a hundred hours of @entity7 's internet sermons during a short time frame			2
" i started to get really into it and i listened to everything ... like all of his recorded lectures that he made			0
... everybody listens to him and likes him anyway , " she told police hours after her arrest			0
" he explains things really comprehensively and in an interesting way , so i thought i could learn a lot from him			0
" several others convicted of plotting terrorist attacks in the @entity13 were followers of @entity7			0
they include several of those convicted for plotting to blow up trans - @entity24 airliners leaving from @entity123 's @entity181 in 2006 and several of those convicted of plotting to attack the @entity184 military base in @entity185 in 2007			0
at least one member of @entity188 's @entity45 group who plotted to attack subways in the city in september 2009 regularly listened to @entity7 lectures , according to court documents			0
@entity194 , a @entity195 charged with attempting to blow up a @entity197 lighting ceremony in @entity198 in november 2010 appears to have been such a fan of @entity7 that he sent an article he hoped would be published by @entity3 , according to the complaint in his case			0
@entity203 has pleaded not guilty			0
@entity204 , a @entity98 convert who allegedly plotted to bomb a military recruiting station near @entity207 in december 2010 , was recorded by undercover agents describing @entity7 as his " beloved sheikh			0
" ( @entity204 has pleaded not guilty			0
) while @entity9 and @entity29 radicals respected , admired , and were inspired by @entity212 , recent cases have made clear that many of them loved and listened to @entity7 even more			1
in the medium term , his removal from the scene will make @entity70 countries safer			0
as well as being an inspirational figure to @entity92 radicals , @entity7 was the key driver of @entity221 's ambitions to launch attacks against the @entity9 , playing a key operational role in orchestrating plots and recruiting @entity70 operatives who could help carry them out			2
but in the short term , counterterrorism officials on both sides of the @entity24 will be worried that his followers will carry out a revenge attack , as he taught them , in his name .			0

@entity233 and @entity36 were two important @entity4 - language voices for @entity1
@entity233 built up a large following in the @entity9 and the @entity29
many who carried out or attempted various attacks have *connections* to him
at least one highly visible @entity4 - language propagandist remains : @entity64
