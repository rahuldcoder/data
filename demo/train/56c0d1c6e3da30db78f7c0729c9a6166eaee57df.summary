it 's clearly a chilling message			2
but after a video from terror group @entity5 calling for attacks on shopping malls in @entity8 , the @entity9 and the @entity10 , how worried should shoppers be ? homeland security secretary @entity11 told @entity1 sunday that there 's " no credible or specific evidence " suggesting a @entity10 mall attack is in the works			1
but he warned @entity10 to watch out			1
" if anyone is planning to go to the @entity17 today , " he said , " they 've got to be particularly careful			2
" the @entity20 mall is among those mentioned in the video the @entity24 - based terror group apparently posted on saturday			2
the video talks about @entity5 's september 2013 attack at an upscale mall in @entity28 , @entity29 , calling for similar attacks in the three @entity32 countries			1
more than 60 people were killed in the @entity29 mall siege , which lasted four days			0
@entity1 is only naming the malls that have responded publicly to the terror group 's video threat			1
mall of @entity10 said it 's aware that the video lists it as a potential target			1
" we take any potential threat seriously and respond appropriately , " the @entity20 mall said in a statement			0
" we have implemented extra security precautions ; some may be noticeable to guests , and others wo n't be			2
" the @entity50 and @entity51 issued a joint written statement saying local law enforcement and first responders have been told the agencies are not " aware of any specific , credible plot against the @entity17 or any other domestic commercial shopping center			1
" the police department in @entity59 , @entity20 , which regularly patrols the mall , also said there was no credible threat against it , describing the mall as a " very safe place			0
" " enhanced security measures to include additional personnel have been implemented and all information is being monitored , " police said in a statement sunday			2
stressing that there is no known credible threat to any mall , @entity11 also cautioned , " i wo n't know about when the next bad actor is going to strike			0
" another @entity10 law enforcement official familiar with the situation also told @entity1 that there is no actual working threat against any mall in the country and added that no one should avoid going to a mall because of the online threat			1
a top @entity8 official condemned the video , saying authorities there are monitoring threats and will take " the appropriate actions " to protect public safety			0
" @entity8 will not be intimidated by threats from any terrorist organization , " public safety minister @entity92 said			0
a joint intelligence bulletin from the @entity51 and the @entity50 states there is no indication of an ongoing plot from @entity5 in the @entity10 , according to two law enforcement officials who have seen it			1
the bulletin , sent to law enforcement around the country , urges vigilance against a lone wolf - type attack that the group 's latest video message could inspire			1
the intelligence assessment , the bulletin says , is that there is no credible specific threat to malls in the @entity10			1
the @entity51 and the @entity50 believe the video was an attempt by @entity5 to compete for attention and recruits with other terrorist groups , one official said			1
@entity5 's strength is compromised , a @entity10 law enforcement official told @entity1 , and while the group has the desire to see a mall attack in the @entity10 , it likely does n't have the capability to do so			1
" there will be enhanced security ( at malls ) , " @entity11 said , " but public vigilance , public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important , and it 's the environment we 're in , frankly			0
" a short time later , homeland security assistant secretary @entity134 told @entity1 that @entity11 " did n't say that they should not go to the mall			1
he told shoppers to be extra vigilant and that security was increased			2
" @entity138 , a spokesman for @entity20 gov. @entity139 , said the governor is " monitoring this situation , and will continue to consult the guidance of federal , state and local law enforcement officials , who are working together to assure the safety of all @entity145			0
" security concerns did n't stop shoppers from packing the @entity17 on sunday , @entity1 affiliate @entity147 reported			1
some shoppers were taking the situation in stride			0
others said they were concerned about the threat			0
" i 'm scared , because i have kids , " @entity155 told @entity147			0
the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity8 , which was also listed in the @entity5 video , said it has implemented extra security and is working with federal and local law enforcement agencies			1
@entity165 police said there was " no imminent threat " to the city , @entity8 broadcaster @entity162 reported			0
" this was a very general comment ... it was n't a specific threat , " @entity169 , deputy chief of the @entity170 , told @entity162			0
" however , we as a policing agency ( are ) absolutely paying attention to this			0
" in the @entity9 , @entity178 said it is aware of the @entity5 video			1
the @entity50 has a program to work with various malls around the country to improve security , the law enforcement official also told @entity1			1
after the 2013 @entity28 attack , the bureau worked with some malls last year to test the readiness of @entity191 teams by staging fake attacks during hours when malls were closed , the official said			0
although @entity5 has also targeted youth in @entity8 , @entity198 and the @entity9 for recruitment , its past attacks have been limited to @entity200			1
but the @entity24 - based militants have heavily recruited in @entity202 , where young men have been slipping away to join the terror group			0
the city is home to the largest @entity24 population in the @entity10			2
in addition to @entity29 and @entity24 , @entity5 has also struck in @entity209 , where it killed more than 70 people gathered to watch a @entity212 soccer match in @entity213 five years ago			2
@entity29 and @entity209 have sent their forces to neighboring @entity24 to battle the extremists			0
as the attacks get more daring , the international community has rallied to fight the militants			0
last year , the @entity10 launched an airstrike in @entity24 that killed the @entity5 leader			1
the terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death			0
@entity5 started off with a goal of waging a war against the @entity24 government in an effort to implement a stricter form of @entity231 law , or @entity232			2
it has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in @entity24 and beyond			0
@entity1 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			2
