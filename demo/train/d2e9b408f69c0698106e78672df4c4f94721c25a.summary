-- @entity1 insists he is n't angry about receiving too much junk mail			1
and the @entity4 , @entity5 , native is n't trying to scare anybody off his front lawn			2
nor does he say he 's trying to send a message -- intimidating , political or otherwise			0
the only thing @entity1 hoped to accomplish by erecting a massive , scale - model @entity11 on his front lawn as a mailbox was to drum up business			1
and that business of course is ... cabinet making ? " if i can show folks i 'm capable of this type of craftsmanship , " @entity1 told @entity0 , " then i can certainly build them a fancy box			1
" that 's one clever son of a gun			2
" i 've built some pretty elaborate stuff in my day " the 49 - year - old said of his giant mailbox gun			1
" this one was pretty difficult			0
it 's scaled out perfect			0
" at 10 feet long , 5 feet high and with an 8 and 3/8 inch wide barrel , @entity1 says his @entity31 is precisely 11 times bigger than the real thing			1
and at 350 pounds , it 's safe to say it 's the heaviest mailbox on the block			0
@entity38 group , others call for @entity39 to ban guns in stores @entity1 said he worked on it in his shop for an hour a day for nearly four months -- using mostly plywood , pvc plastic , oak and mahogany			0
reaction has come in from all corners of the globe and from all corners of the gun debate			0
@entity1 , who says he is " not a gun - toting nitwit or anything like that " tells @entity0 his neighbors have mostly been supportive -- and that most of the criticism comes from faraway " yuppies who do n't know anything about guns			1
" as for the person who has to stare down the barrel of that gun day in and day out ? " my mail lady thinks it 's great ! " while his giant gun certainly got @entity1 attention , it has yet to get him any business -- any cabinet - making business , that is			1
he says he 's already been approached about building a giant firearm - for - a - mailbox for someone , and that is just fine by him			2
" i 'd rather build these things than fancy boxes			0
" gun permits for the blind ? @entity79 grants them , stirs debate			0
