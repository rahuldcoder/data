-- the only tinge of regret @entity2 has from another prodigious @entity5 campaign is that she did n't take a leaf out of @entity8 's book			1
another two fencing gold medals at @entity10 took her tally to seven overall , enhancing her reputation of one of @entity14 's greatest ever @entity5 , and she had planned to premiere her very own signature pose at the apex of her latest triumph			1
but the 28 - year - old , who jokes she only took up fencing because she was promised there would be plenty of " handsome guys " on show , missed the chance to showcase her own version of the @entity29 sprinter 's move because she was too immersed in battle			1
" i watched the @entity33 and saw so many champions when they won try to do so many signature postures , " she told @entity0 's human to @entity32			2
" i did think ' what should i do if i get the gold medal in @entity38 ? should i kiss the blade or hug the coach ? ' " finally ( when i ) knew that i won , i just took off my mask with a facial expression that my friend said looked like i had just woken up because i was still concentrating ! " her celebrations might need some work but @entity47 's pedigree in the noble art of fencing is indisputable			1
diagnosed with bone cancer in her left leg at the age of 11 , @entity47 eventually had to have part of it removed			1
after making the move to fencing from swimming , she was instantly transfixed , rising through the ranks to make her @entity60 debut at @entity61 , @entity62 , in 2004 , aged just 20			2
the sport , based on attack and defense with swords , has a heritage that some claim dates back as far as 1200 bc , due to the discovery of several ancient @entity71 carvings detailing duels involving combatants with blades and wearing masks for protection			0
after being enticed along to her first lesson by a friend who promised a bevy of attractive men to look at , @entity47 was transfixed			1
" in the very first lesson , i did n't see any handsome guys but i felt fencing was so cool because the costume is all in white and you have to wear a mask			0
it 's just so mysterious			0
it reminded me of the movie ' @entity91			0
' " after that i found fencing does not only have a good appearance , but also the strategy and the technique is very interesting			0
you have to use your physical strength together with your mental strength			0
i think it is so challenging and i love it			0
" fencing remains one of only four sports to have featured in every modern @entity60 since 1896 but @entity47 's first thought when she arrived at the world 's biggest sporting event at the age of 20 was about hamburgers , not history			1
" i was so excited , " she explained			0
" everything was just so new to me			0
" i heard there 's a restaurant open 24 hours and a fast food shop which you can take all the food that you want free of charge			0
i could n't wait to eat so many hamburgers ! " that excitement was also transmitted to @entity47 's performance as she bagged a gold medal in all four of her events in 2004 , both as an individual and as part of the @entity14 team in the epee and foil categories , which use different blades and scoring systems			1
wheelchair fencing sees athletes compete in a chair that is fixed into a frame and fastened to the floor			0
points are scored by landing a blow with the tip of your sword on an opponent in epee and foil			0
@entity47 excelled in both fields of combat			1
she 's taken part in nine fencing events in her @entity5 career to date winning seven golds , one silver and one bronze			1
after the relative disappointment of winning only one gold in @entity38 , where she had to settle for silver in the epee , @entity47 bounced back to win both her individual events at @entity10 despite a difficult preparation working with a new coach -- during which she had contemplated quitting the sport			1
" i was so depressed			0
i 'm quite an optimistic girl , and i can hardly imagine that i cried a lot at that time			0
after training i would just go back to the room and cry because i did n't know what i was doing and the training atmosphere was just not very good			0
" however , cheered by her teammates and helped with her training by able - bodied fencing colleagues , she got back in the groove and had a successful games , also winning bronze in a team event			1
" when i came back , i just bought them a very big meal and shared my happiness with them			0
" @entity47 's record makes her one of @entity14 's most successful @entity5 , and that fact leaves her bursting with pride			1
" whenever i see the @entity14 flag is flying in the sky , not because of anybody else , because of my efforts , i think it 's the most proud time of my life , " @entity47 said			1
" i was the first female fencer in @entity14 who captured four gold medals in the @entity5 ( in @entity61 )			1
" when i came back to @entity14 , so many reporters and journalists were waiting for us and interviewing us , and i thought ' wow , i just looked like a @entity196 star ! ' " i am so proud of being a paralympian because i think the @entity60 are a very good platform for disabled persons to perform themselves			2
" within the @entity5 movement , it 's not just talk about excellence , it 's not just talk about the competition , it 's also talk about the equality and how your world accepts those disabled people			2
" @entity47 's infectious character explains why she 's had little difficulty in overcoming the treacherous obstacles that were placed in front of her at such an early age			2
a dedicated , passionate athlete , away from fencing she is relentlessly positive , something that has driven her through cancer and onto a clutch of gold medals			1
" when i had bone cancer , i was just 11 years old			2
i think my parents suffered a lot because they worried about my health , my life , so much , " she said			2
" for me , it was quite bad feeling during the treatment			0
but i quite enjoyed staying in the hospital because so many kids played with me			0
" every time when i talk about this memory , my mom scolds me because she says , ' come one , no one like hospital life , only you			2
' " i think the most important thing for your life is the way you interpret things			1
having an optimistic point of view is so important -- your life will be so bright			2

fencer @entity2 has seven @entity5 gold medals to her name
the 28 - year - old from @entity14 had part of her leg *amputated* when she was 11
@entity47 says she forgot to strike a signature pose after winning gold in @entity252
@entity47 : " i think the most important thing for your life , is the way you interpret things "
