-- the town of @entity2 in the southwest of @entity4 is best known for its long sandy beaches and picturesque bays			1
nowhere on its tourist brochures is a complex of white domes and dishes at @entity12 mentioned			2
after the latest revelations published by the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , @entity12 may become a little more familiar			1
the site -- now officially known as @entity18 ( @entity18 ) @entity2 -- is at the heart of a global eavesdropping network run by the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
it has more than 20 antennae orientated toward global communications satellites over the @entity26 and @entity27 oceans , @entity28 and the @entity29 , according to declassified sources			2
based on documents provided by former @entity21 contractor @entity33 , the three newspapers reported friday that @entity2 is a critical hub in eavesdropping on the communications of government figures , and many others , in @entity39 and beyond			1
among some 1,000 organizations and individuals whose e-mail or phone numbers appear in the documents : the @entity46 , the government of @entity48 , @entity28 heads of state , the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) and the @entity51			2
none of the newspapers published any of the documents they were shown , and the volume of information collected on any particular individual or organization is unclear			2
the @entity15 reported that , " the documents include a few fragmentary transcripts of conversations and messages			2
" but one of the many hundreds of phone numbers listed in the documents from 2009 was that of a senior @entity39 official , @entity66 , who is @entity67			1
at the time -- just as @entity39 's financial crisis gathered pace -- @entity66 was the @entity72 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner			2
according to @entity16 , he had a " personal identification code in the @entity75 target database , with the code name " @entity77			2
" @entity66 has since become the competition commissioner , handling antitrust disputes , and has been in a long - running dispute with @entity81 over search - engine practices			2
in an apparent reference to the allegations about @entity66 , the @entity21 said in a statement friday : " we do not use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of -- or give intelligence we collect to -- @entity91 companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line			1
" ' this is not the type of behavior that we expect ' according to the @entity15 , the @entity100 oil company @entity99 and defense contractor @entity98 also are mentioned in the documents			2
the @entity21 statement concluded : " the @entity91 government is undertaking a review of our activities around the world -- looking at , among other issues , how we coordinate with our closest allies and partners			1
" the @entity46 reacted swiftly to the latest revelations			1
a spokeswoman in @entity113 said that if proven true , they " are unacceptable and deserve our strongest condemnation			0
this is not the type of behavior that we expect from strategic partners , let alone from our own member @entity91 , " meaning the @entity75			0
" the @entity46 will raise these new allegations with @entity91 and @entity75 authorities , " she added			0
@entity67 media also pounced on revelations about @entity66 's communications			1
the headline in @entity127 translated as : " the @entity91 and @entity75 spied on commissioner @entity129 's mobile , " while @entity130 also focused on " @entity131 " as the perpetrator			0
the @entity75 government is likely to come under further scrutiny from its @entity39 partners over its intelligence gathering activities			0
@entity75 criticism of the @entity21 program has been more muted than that of @entity100 , @entity140 or @entity67 , in part because of the long intelligence partnership between the two countries			1
review : @entity21 snooping programs should stay in place according to @entity140 chancellor @entity147 , @entity75 prime minister @entity146 did not join in a vigorous debate at the @entity72 summit in october on the @entity21 eavesdropping , rather expressing his " silent acquiescence " to a strongly - worded statement in which @entity75 was indirectly warned that " a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence gathering			1
" by then , @entity16 had already reported that the documents leaked by @entity33 showed that @entity18 had been involved in a cyberattack against @entity161 's state - run telecom company , @entity160			0
the company would only say at the time that " the intruder had massive resources , sophisticated means and a steadfast intent to break into our network			0
" @entity18 shares much of the information it collects with the @entity21			1
more than eyes on the sky ? the @entity14 reported earlier this year , again based on documents provided by @entity33 , that the @entity21 had provided some $ 25 million to update the @entity2 facility			1
but it is also likely that the @entity21 has been and is still be able to gather directly data harvested by @entity2			1
@entity177 , an investigative reporter and author of several books on intelligence , told a committee of the @entity182 in 2001 that " communications were screened for keywords entered into the system by the @entity91 using ' dictionary managers '			0
the @entity75 therefore had no control over the screening process and had no idea what information was collected in @entity12 , since it was forwarded directly to the @entity91			0
" @entity16 reported friday that @entity2 may do more than gaze into the heavens			0
" important undersea cables land at nearby @entity194 , " it reported			0
" one of the cables , called @entity197 , begins at @entity140 telecommunications company @entity199 's undersea cable terminal			0
" @entity197 links terminals in @entity201 , @entity140 , the @entity202 , the @entity75 and the @entity91			0
that may explain how so many @entity140 telephone numbers appear in one 2009 document provided to the newspapers by @entity33			0
" other documents indicate that the @entity75 , at least intermittently , kept tabs on entire country - to - country satellite communication links , " like those between @entity140 and @entity213 , @entity16 reported			0
@entity12 has long been part of a global network of stations involved in intercepting satellite communications			0
the 2001 @entity182 report concluded : " in @entity12 ...			0
@entity18 , working in cooperation with the @entity21 and in strict accordance with the latter 's instructions , intercepts civilian communications and passes on the recordings to the @entity91 as raw intelligence material			1
" surveillance program is now @entity227 's to own			1
