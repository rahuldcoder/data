" we are the underdogs in this campaign , as we always have been , " @entity33 said			2
" we know that the @entity50 establishment will fling the kitchen sink and half the living room and probably most of the bedroom at us before the close of polls at 10 o'clock tomorrow night			0
and therefore it behooves each and every one of us , recognizing that underdog status , to campaign with our utmost ... to persuade our fellow citizens that independence is the right road forward for @entity1			1

fallout from the referendum could play into the next @entity14 general election , scheduled for may 2015			0
asked by a reporter whether he would quit if @entity1 chooses independence , @entity120 said , " my name is not on the ballot paper ; what 's on the ballot paper is , does @entity1 want to stay in the @entity14 or does @entity1 want to separate itself from the @entity14 ? " that 's the only question that should be decided on thursday night			1
the question about my future will be decided at the @entity14 general election coming soon			0
" in an interview with the @entity150 , @entity120 also defended the way the referendum has been handled by his conservative - led coalition government			0
