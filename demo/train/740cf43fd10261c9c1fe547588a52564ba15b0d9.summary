-- a newly discovered account of the shooting of @entity3 , and his death the next morning , gives a vivid and moving picture of the calamity			1
dr. @entity7 was in the audience at @entity9 when @entity3 was shot , and was the first to attempt to treat the stricken president			1
in a report believed written the next day , april 15 , 1865 , @entity7 writes , " the report of a pistol was distinctly heard and about a minute after a man of low stature with black hair and eyes was seen leaping to the stage beneath , holding in his hand a drawn dagger			1
" stumbling as he leaped from the president 's box , the man " ran to the opposite side of the stage , flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and disappearing behind the scene			2
" @entity7 ran to the president 's box , about 40 feet from where he 'd been sitting , where he encountered @entity32			2
she said , " ' @entity34 , do what you can for him ! do what you can ! ' i told her we would do all that we possibly could , " @entity7 writes			0
then he saw the president			0
" he was in a state of general paralysis , his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition			0
" @entity7 was just 23 , and had only barely begun practicing medicine after his service in the @entity46			0
he describes how he tried to treat the injury , beginning with asking another man to cut off @entity3 's coat and shirt to find any stab wounds			1
@entity7 first believed @entity3 had been stabbed , because of that sighting of @entity53 wielding a knife			1
but soon @entity7 realized the president 's injury was a gunshot in the back of his head			2
@entity7 writes that he " passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball , and found that it had entered the encephalon			0
as soon as i removed my finger a slight oozing of blood followed and his breathing became more regular			0
" @entity3 is then given some brandy , and two more doctors arrive			1
the report was found by @entity74 , a researcher for the papers of @entity3 , at the @entity76 in @entity77			1
she discovered it among the papers of the @entity81 surgeon general			2
her group 's mission is to collect all documents " to and from @entity3 , " she said , and she came upon a copy of @entity87 's report by accident on may 21			1
the report is not in @entity7 's own hand , but is a " true copy " written by a clerk			1
" its immediacy makes it so very moving , " said @entity74			0
" but it 's also so very clinical , and you realize how awful it was -- the injury that @entity3 sustained was just horrific			1
" read the full document standing outside @entity9 in downtown @entity77 , @entity74 explained it was too far to take @entity3 to the @entity100 , so the doctors took him to a house across the street			1
" you can see how narrow the street is , " she said , pointing from @entity9 across to the historic @entity104 , where tourists were taking guided tours of the site			0
" even that little journey was traumatic			0
" there is no indication that @entity7 and the other doctors had any way to save @entity3			1
" you get a sense of helplessness , " said @entity74			0
" i think it was fairly immediate that he realized that the president was n't going to recover			0
" @entity74 said that , to her , the most moving part of @entity87 's report is his account of covering @entity3 shortly after the president was carried to a back bedroom of the @entity104			1
" he talks about how the president 's legs -- his lower extremities , from the knees down -- were cold , and they brought him hot water bottles and hot blankets			2
i find that a very touching part of the report			2
" the document also describes in clinical terms the president 's deterioration that night			1
near the end of the report it states : " at 7:20 a.m. he breathed his last and ' the spirit fled to @entity142 who gave it			0
' " the very last line of the report seems to relay how absorbed @entity7 became in the gravity of the moment			0
" immediately after death had taken place , we all bowed and the rev. dr. @entity152 supplicated to @entity142 in behalf of the bereaved family and our afflicted country			0
" @entity74 talks about the moment she discovered this document			2
" i took it out of the box , and started reading through it -- reading parts out to my colleagues who sat at the same table as me			0
... we realized we had something special on our hands			0
" @entity165 , with the @entity166 of the @entity77 , said the newly discovered report largely corroborates the account that @entity87 eventually published over 40 years later , in 1909			1
while it adds only a few details to known accounts of @entity3 's final hours , @entity165 said , " this report has more exact times and pulse rate measurements through the night -- an intriguing new detail for historians			1
" agreeing with the researchers who found it , @entity165 said that the document has a compelling immediacy , and is unclouded by the passage of time			0
" the original report does get you right close to the event -- knowing that the doctor leaves the bedside and writes it within the day , " he said .			2
