-- as he admitted himself this week , @entity1 has no idea how long his career may last but tennis fans in @entity5 were guaranteed another chance to see him after the @entity7 survived a first round scare against @entity10 's @entity9			1
the reigning champion -- bidding for his sixth title at the @entity13 -- had to come from behind to win 5 - 7 6 - 0 6 - 2 against the @entity14 128 , who was playing his first @entity17 @entity17 match since october			1
" it was a difficult match for me out here tonight , but i 'm happy i found a way and got a day off now so i can work a little bit on the game , " said @entity1 , who beat @entity18 in last year 's final			1
" just maybe the pressure is off a little bit , and then automatically i will play a lot better in the second round			1
" in the run - up to monday 's game , @entity1 -- who will play either @entity31 or @entity32 ( both of @entity34 ) in the next round -- revealed he will undertake a far lighter schedule this year			1
the 31 - year - old will take nearly two months off after the @entity38 in @entity38 , which runs from march 4 - 17 , before returning in may to play the @entity39			1
the @entity7 says the break will allow him to take a holiday with his wife and twin three - year - old daughters before spending 4 - 6 weeks practising on clay courts in @entity7			1
" the last few years have been really tricky in terms of my practice schedule , especially through an @entity48 year [ in 2012 ] , " said the 17 - time grand slam winner			1
" this year is totally different			2
family is very important , so i also want to spend quality time with them			2
" " i ca n't play a year like i did last year every single season because that is n't the point i 'm at in my career			2
i 'm not 22 where i have to play 25 - 30 tournaments a year			2
plus , i believe i 'll be really ready for the tournaments i 've entered			2
" @entity1 is planning to play just 14 tournaments in 2013 , even dropping his home town event in @entity60 and the @entity62 tournament , which has often been described as the biggest outside the four grand slams			1
@entity1 , who won @entity64 but lost the @entity48 final last year , may be vying for the top honours with @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity18 but his chances of success are threatened by being nearly five years more senior than the next oldest			1
" i 'm trying to be smart with my scheduling because i 'm in a totally different situation than they are , " he said			2
" your prime is 23 to 27 - 28 so for me it 's very challenging -- and exciting			2
i need to make the right decisions			0
i have family and not many guys have that			0
" considered by many as the greatest of all time , @entity1 stressed that his lighter workload is intended to prolong his playing career and insists it is not a sign of him winding down			1
" i strongly believe i have more slams in me , " he rallied			0
" i can play great , but will i be allowed to ? @entity88 will tell			0
" my big focus is on making sure that every tournament i enter i am perfectly prepared			0
i am hopeful i will get enough matches but if not my schedule can be changed			0
" " i want to give myself the best chance to play as long as i can			0
maybe then it will become clear that it is time to stop			0
things change very quickly , and you have to be ready and open about it			0
" but i would like to give myself the chance to play for many years to come			0
i am happy with the way my body is			0
i am healthy and happy to be playing			0
" if i feel confident and am enjoying it , i hope to play for a long time			0
i think i am playing excellent tennis			0
some win grand slams at 16 and others at 34			0
it depends how you see things			0
" in monday 's other opening games of the @entity111 $ 2.4m championships , seventh seed @entity113 of @entity115 turned around a 0 - 4 losing run against @entity116 to beat the @entity117 6 - 3 7 - 5			1
@entity113 will next play @entity119 @entity118 , who beat @entity115 qualifier @entity121 6 - 3 7 - 5 , while @entity123 's @entity122 beat @entity124 1 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 3			1
next up for @entity122 will be @entity125 , who beat fellow qualifier @entity126 7 - 6 ( 7 ) 6 - 4 , while @entity127 of @entity34 made it through when beating @entity130 's @entity129 in straight sets			1
on tuesday , the 32 - man field will be further whittled down -- with @entity68 among those entering the action , with the @entity135 taking on fellow @entity136 , and childhood friend , @entity137 .			1
