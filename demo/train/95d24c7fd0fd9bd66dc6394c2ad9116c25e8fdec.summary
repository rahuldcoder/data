-- with the explosive growth of the light truck segment as well as the impending onslaught of winter , i thought it would be fitting to write about four - wheel drive systems			1
there are a few different types available ; and there are special maintenance practices that might cause some confusion			2
so let 's get enlightened ! four - wheel drive systems can make driving safer on wet road conditions			1
4wd systems can be classified as @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18			1
@entity16 is the most basic of all 4wd systems			1
it gives the driver the choice of driving in two - wheel drive or @entity16			1
that sounds pretty good ! however , the downside is that you should n't engage the @entity16 on pavement unless it 's very slippery			1
that 's because , with this system , when you engage @entity16 you lock the front and rear wheels together through the transmission and transfer gearbox			2
this is great for straight - ahead traction and very slippery surfaces			2
however , on dry pavement it makes for odd cornering , and handling characteristics			1
also you can harm the drive train components by driving in @entity16 for extended periods of time on dry pavement			1
consequently , you may find yourself having to stop the vehicle to engage or disengage , depending on the road conditions			0
@entity45 autos : top 5 @entity46 so why choose this type of system ? two good reasons : it 's less costly to build and therefore to buy it 's very durable under heavy stress ( generally more durable than the other 4wd systems , since it has fewer components ) @entity17 is the most commonly used system on the market			2
full @entity16 offers both two - wheel drive mode and @entity16 , depending on road conditions ( driver must engage and disengage the @entity16 )			1
in addition , the 4wd mode offers both a high and low mode for when the going really gets tough ( driver shifts to high or low )			2
@entity45 autos : top 5 crossover vehicles besides a transmission and transfer gearbox , a center differential couples the front and rear wheels			2
this differential allows the front and rear wheels to turn at different speeds as needed ( unlike @entity73 system ) for better handling			0
when the wheels start to spin due to slippery road conditions , the system reacts to wheel spin by progressively locking the front and rear wheels together to optimize traction			2
although @entity80 requires the driver to engage it , once engaged it offers more " control " through the high and low mode selection ( based on road conditions ) and better cornering and handling on varying road conditions due to the differential			1
@entity45 autos : best luxury wagons @entity18 is similar to @entity89 but it has no two - wheel drive mode			1
the vehicle is always in @entity16 , so you do n't have to determine whether conditions are right to engage it			1
@entity45 autos : cars with best @entity97 values we still have transmission , transfer gearbox and center differential coupling the front and rear wheels			0
the only difference is that torque ( or power ) is constantly being applied to all the wheels , giving maximum traction in all weather and road conditions			0
current systems have high and low modes for when the going gets tough ; however , most importantly , the system does the thinking for you ... it automatically applies as much lock up ( to all the wheels ) as necessary for maximum traction			0
@entity45 autos : best - selling trucks and @entity46 next , a few definitions of common 4wd - drive terms that you may have heard of : locking differential - locks both wheels on the axle , forcing them to turn together to allow maximum traction limited - slip differential - detects slippage in one wheel and sends torque to the other wheel that is not spinning			1
on - @entity130 - shifting - allows the @entity16 to be engaged while driving the vehicle ( many systems require that you stop the vehicle in order to engage the @entity16 )			1
manual hubs - in order for @entity16 to work , you must have a means of engaging the front wheel drive mechanism			1
this is done through the front hubs			2
on vehicles equipped with manual hubs , the operator must manually " lock in " the front wheels by turning a mechanical switch			2
automatic hubs - instead of manually " locking in " the front wheels in order to drive in @entity16 , automatic hubs " lock in " the front wheels by a simple flip of an electrical switch in the comfort of your warm , cushy , @entity46 or pickup			1
@entity157 - an auxiliary gearbox attached to the transmission , which allows you to shift into a high and low range of @entity16 for serious pulling or hauling			1
@entity162 4x4s have a transfer case , locking hubs , and front and rear differentials ( some have an additional center - coupling differential )			1
the maintenance of the transfer case is the same as on a standard transmission			2
therefore , when checking the fluid , you are checking for ( 1 ) proper level , ( 2 ) the presence of moisture , ( 3 ) the presence of wear particles ... either in the form of metal or friction material			0
a small amount of wear material is acceptable			0
however , excessive wear material can be an indication of a problem			0
one of three types of lubricants is used , depending on the carmaker			0
these lubricants are : @entity193 ( @entity193 ) , @entity195 motor oil , or @entity196			0
the maintenance interval ( which involves changing the lubricant ) for transfer cases that use @entity193 and @entity201 motor oil is every 50,000 miles			0
for @entity204 gear oil the recommended interval is 80,000 miles			0
in regards to the locking hubs , maintenance is extremely critical			1
locking hubs come in two forms : automatic and manual			1
regardless of which one you have , they must be disassembled , cleaned and lubricated every two years or 24,000 miles			0
@entity214 , ice , water , salt , and mud usually find their way into these mechanized units , rendering them useless and costing the owner big bucks ! by keeping up the maintenance on them you minimize expense and downtime			0
with respect to differential maintenance , there 's not a whole lot to do except check the fluid level every oil change and visually inspect for any leakage			0
the technician should check the gear lubricant for proper level , color , and consistency			0
low lubricant level indicates a leak ; a milky color indicates moisture in the lubricant ; and the presence of metal in the lubricant indicates mechanical wear			0
check your owner 's manual for the recommended fluid change intervals			0
and check your owner 's manual for specific operating instructions of your 4x4 system because the various systems function differently			0
there you have it , four wheeling made easy			0
now go out and climb a mountain ! @entity261 is a veteran of 37 years in the auto service industry , an automotive journalist registered with @entity264 .			0

vehicles can have @entity267 , @entity17 or @entity18
part @entity16 : do n't drive for extended time on dry pavement with @entity16 engaged
@entity271 offers both two - wheel drive mode and @entity16
maintenance is extremely critical for locking hubs on @entity16 vehicles
