-- it was n't long after @entity2 exploded off the coast of @entity4 on a warm july evening in 1996 that the conspiracy theorists emerged			1
seventeen years later , they 're still here			0
i have n't seen a new documentary that purports to repudiate the conclusions of the @entity10 , which ruled that the crash of the 747 headed for @entity12 was caused by a center fuel tank explosion likely ignited by faulty wiring			1
but i do know that -- despite all the media attention the filmmakers are getting -- their essential claim that a missile hit the plane is not new			2
and neither are aircraft fuel tank explosions			1
in fact , they were considered enough of a danger that the @entity25 has put in place new regulations to prevent such events			1
and the @entity25 , heavily lobbied by airlines and aircraft manufacturers who want to keep their costs low , does not enact new regulations without reason			1
when i covered the four - year investigation into @entity2 for @entity35 , i spent hundreds of hours interviewing investigators , scientists and experts ; i walked around inside the center fuel tank of a @entity40 ( yes , it 's that big ) at a plant in @entity43 ; and i continued to cover the aftermath of the @entity10 's final report that culminated in an @entity25 rule to make airlines pump inert gas into fuel tanks to prevent explosions			1
i remember being surprised when i first learned of fuel - tank explosions on aircraft , particularly those designed with air - conditioning units below the center tank			1
at first it seemed unbelievable			0
but when an aircraft 's fuel tank is nearly empty , as is often the case with the center tank , the heat from the air - conditioning packs underneath combined with ambient temperatures can create , well , what seems like a bomb on board			1
in 1990 , the fuel tank of a @entity67 plane exploded on the ground in @entity69 , killing eight people			1
in 2001 , a @entity72 plane blew up on the ground in @entity74 when its center tank exploded			2
and as recently as 2006 , the wing tank of a @entity77 exploded on the ground in @entity79 , @entity80			0
in 2000 , the @entity25 compiled a list of 26 fuel - tank explosions dating back to 1959			1
i also remember the day l learned that the system that tells pilots how much fuel remains includes electrical components located inside the tank			2
although aircraft wiring is made to be strong and durable , it is also subject to the effects of aging and abrasion -- so much so that short circuits can occur			0
on july 17 , 1996 , the conditions -- a volatile fuel - air mix of vapors in the center fuel tank heated to the point of being explosive , a likely short circuit in fuel - gauge wiring and 230 people on board -- came together with a tragic result			1
i ca n't speak to the motives of the former investigators who are calling for a renewed investigation			0
but it is important to note that while a poster from the film on epix.com trumpets , " inside investigators finally break their silence , " one of the key investigators featured testified about the @entity10 's failings before the @entity113 in 1999			2
it would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago			0
as for the missile theory , its main proponents were those eyewitnesses who reported seeing a streak of light in the sky on the night of the crash			0
that streak has been explained as the still - airborne fuselage of the @entity40 after the nose of the plane broke off and fell to earth -- and debris recovery patterns confirm this scenario			0
metallurgical evidence showed that the fuel tank , the main structural component between the wings , exploded from the inside , with no evidence of a puncture or outside entry			1
the filmmakers say they have new radar evidence			0
i do n't know why it has n't surfaced before now , or how it will contradict the physical evidence that shows the fuel tank exploded from the inside			1
i do know that when the process turns to fault - finding in aviation accidents , there are many competing interests with a stake in the game -- the pilots ' union , aircraft manufacturers and airlines , all with lawyers ready to battle their side			0
when i covered aviation safety , it seemed that the @entity10 was the only entity with no conflicts of interest			0
even the media want a good story -- and what better story than a missile and cover - up ? i imagine the same can be said of people who want to sell an idea for a documentary			2
fuel - tank explosions and exposed wiring just are n't that sexy			2
conspiracy theories about @entity2 are a bit like 17 - year cicadas			0
except they seem to emerge a bit more often			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : conspiracy theorists have long *sniffed* around story of flight *800* crash
documentary says @entity10 finding -- crash caused by center fuel tank blast -- was wrong
she says findings caused new regulations ; @entity25 does n't make costly changes without reason
@entity202 : there 's huge *amount* of physical evidence @entity10 right -- where 's filmmakers ' proof ?
