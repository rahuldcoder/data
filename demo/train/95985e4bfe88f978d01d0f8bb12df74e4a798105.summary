-- each @entity2 , i thank my father for giving me life -- twice -- the first time in the traditional sense and the second when he donated his kidney to me			1
when i speak about getting him a @entity2 gift , he says the best gift i can give him is to live a good , healthy life			1
five years ago , we were in the or , side by side as one of his kidneys was transferred into my body , saving my life			1
i had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes the summer i turned 17 , and now , 20 years later , my kidneys were so damaged from the ups and downs of sugar in my blood that my medical team told me i needed either to get on dialysis or to receive a new organ from a deceased donor or a living relative			1
to my father , the choice was simple -- he said , " let 's do it next week			1
" i marveled at his ability to make a quick decision that would alter both of our bodies forever			0
during the pre-operation testing period , we spent a lot of time together			0
we kept our spirits high and our minds off the possibility of a failure or a postponement ( if one of us got sick , for instance , or if my kidneys got worse and i needed dialysis ) by making plans for the future -- all the things we wanted to do individually and apart			1
before he knew of my condition , my father , 63 , had made plans to climb to @entity54 's base camp with close friends , and it was scheduled for about two months after surgery			2
i was worried about the short recovery time , but he kept his sights on this adventure of a lifetime in addition to my regaining my health			0
as a debt of gratitude to my dad ( who finished his @entity54 trek in good health ) , i created my new company , @entity70 , an organization that aims to connect and help people with chronic disease and inspire them to lead better lives			1
the ultimate goal is curing people of diabetes , kidney disease and other chronic illnesses , but while scientists in academia and industry fight that battle , i wanted to create a place both online and offline , for people to enjoy the small pleasures in life , share their stories , learn about new treatments and medications , and find resources			1
many people are not as fortunate as i was			0
as noted in the 2013 @entity95 @entity94 , about 34 % of patients with diabetes survive five years after initiation of hemodialysis and 10 % were alive after 10 years			2
waiting for an organ on the regular transplant list may take years			2
those years are tough ones , and when the organ finally arrives , it may be too late			0
i believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes			2
improving access to organs is crucial now that the rate of diabetes is exploding and the average age of people living is increasing			1
we will be faced with many individuals needing an organ who may not have someone to ask who is educated about the risks , healthy enough to be approved and willing to step up to the plate			2
since the transplant , my father and i have celebrated holidays , gone skiing , enjoyed wine , argued and laughed -- essentially behaved like a normal father and daughter -- with the exception that we share his original pair of kidneys			2
every day i remind myself what a precious gift my father has given me			0
i am alive today thanks to my father , and i hope to make him proud			0
one day a year is n't enough to celebrate and thank my father for all he has done for me			0
to show my appreciation , the best gift i will give my dad this @entity2 is to take care of my health and to live each day to its fullest			1
it 's the gift i 've been giving him each year since we were in the @entity143			0
and i plan on giving that gift to him for many @entity146 's days to come			0
opinion : son , this is how to be a man when is ' @entity146 ' more than @entity151 ? opinion : 5 lessons my 9 - year - old son taught me about men			0

@entity157 : celebrating @entity2 is n't enough to thank her dad for saving her life
with type 1 diabetes , she needed kidney transplant ; her dad said , " let 's do it next week "
the transplant *success* inspired her to start a site helping those with chronic ailments connect
she says many do n't have option she did ; she thanks her dad by living a good , healthy life
