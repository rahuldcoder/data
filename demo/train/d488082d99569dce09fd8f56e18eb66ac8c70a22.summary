-- in his recent @entity0 opinion piece , " net neutrality is foremost free speech issue of our time , " sen. @entity1 claims that " our free speech rights are under assault -- not from the government but from corporations seeking to control the flow of information in @entity13			1
" he alludes to potential corporate blocking of online products and speech and says , " if that scares you as much as it scares me , then you need to care about net neutrality			1
" chicken little , call your office ! such sky - is - falling scare tactics are all too common in the heated debate over net neutrality regulation , but actual evidence of such nefarious corporate scheming is nowhere to be found			1
perhaps that 's why @entity1 resorts to such tall tales			1
moreover , his reading of the @entity32 is at odds with the one most of us learned about in civics class ( " @entity36 shall make no law ... " )			0
his would empower regulators by converting the @entity32 from a shield against government action into a sword that bureaucrats could wield against private industry			2
we should be skeptical of any claims that net neutrality regulation is consistent with the @entity32 , let alone required by it			1
as first amendment attorney @entity54 has noted ( " @entity32 , the @entity56 " ) , " it should not be forgotten that the federal government 's initial impulse [ in the mid- 1990s ] was to censor the internet and to subject it to a far lower level of @entity32 protection			1
" the real " @entity59 " threat here is a government with the power to completely foreclose all speech under threat of fine or imprisonment -- a power the private sector lacks even if you buy into the silly notion that it is out to bottle up speech or speakers			1
and really , why would any company want " to control the flow of information in @entity13 , " as @entity1 suggests ? first , it 's bad for business			1
there 's just no good business case for censorship			2
internet service providers make more money by delivering more bits , not fewer			0
second , censorship is hard			0
internet service providers simply do n't have the technology or manpower necessary to effectively filter online content by viewpoint			0
third , trying to control information would quickly create public relations nightmares for carriers			0
there 'd be hell for them to pay with the press , industry watchdogs and especially their subscribers			0
the white - hot spotlight of public attention is the best disinfectant			0
finally , any attempt to censor would backfire and actually draw attention to the speech or speaker in question			1
simply stated , the internet 's @entity32 is the @entity32 -- not some new , top - down , heavy - handed regulatory regime that puts the @entity108 in control of the digital economy			2
net neutrality regulation is also tantamount to a declaration of surrender on broadband competition and a call to return to the era of public utility - style regulation			1
we should n't give up so easily on the idea of facilities - based competition that only got started 14 years ago with the @entity123			0
if broadband providers ever possessed " gatekeeper " or " bottleneck " power that required regulation , that rationale for regulation no longer exists			0
the internet has clearly changed the communications landscape , mooting old regulatory ideas once used to justify heavy - handed government regulation of mass media speech and its underlying infrastructure			1
today , 95 percent of @entity13 has access to robust broadband , and the vast majority can choose from multiple broadband providers ( e.g. , wire , wireless and satellite technologies )			0
the investment and innovation that 's made this possible would never have happened in @entity1 's world of heavily regulated infrastructure			1
just as certain is the slippery slope of regulation : neutrality mandates will eventually spread to other layers of the internet to cover content and applications			2
( the @entity108 is already hinting at its interest in regulating in the cloud and other internet services and content )			0
@entity161 and @entity162 's necks may be next on the neutrality chopping block			1
corporations go out of business if they no longer serve consumers			0
the government and its agencies do not			2
for the former , the combination of technological innovation , consumer education , industry best practices and competitive markets all work to blunt the abuses -- real or imagined -- of broadband providers			0
but only the @entity178 and the @entity179 restrain the government			2
if @entity1 has his way , these roles would be reversed and our government would be empowered to control the most important medium of human expression the world has ever known			1
we should think twice before going down that path			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors .			2

big government , not big companies , threaten freedom on the web , say co-authors
they question sen. @entity1 's argument that " net neutrality " is free speech issue of our time
they say companies could not censor the web even if they wanted to do so
companies should be free to innovate on the web , and not be *tightly* regulated , they say
