-- dear @entity1 , @entity1 and @entity1 , my name is @entity4 , and i , too , am a survivor of a kidnapping			1
my sister and i were kidnapped by my baby sitter			1
in 1974 , at the age of 4 , i was forced to live like a fugitive on the run , from cheap motel to cheap motel -- sometimes sleeping in cars			1
i endured extreme abuse and neglect during my entire childhood			2
i only went to school for a few months or weeks at a time , till we would go on the run again			1
i was able to get away when i was 12			1
my kidnapper died in 1986 , when i was 16			2
i had a very difficult time adjusting to the normal world			0
@entity1 , @entity25 and @entity1 , it is so wonderful that all of you are alive and survived your ordeal			1
my heart is with you all			0
hearing about your story , i felt it was important to share with you my journey to healing and recovery from kidnapping			1
it is important that you know that you are not alone			0
you have the love and support of your families , your community and other kidnapping victims who were rescued or escaped			1
you are all survivors , and you will continue to survive			0
it 's been nearly 40 years since the kidnapping , and i am still healing			1
it will be my lifetime work			1
i was diagnosed with severe @entity47 and anxiety and have learned to manage my disorders with acupuncture and @entity52 herbs , which help calm my nervous system after the trauma my body has endured			0
yoga helps tame my mind by using my breath to find peace and calm after many years of trauma			1
i also went to the @entity63 foundation for intensive reunification healing with my family last summer in 2012			2
i am learning how to function in society again and most important , learning how to live again			0
i went back to college and should graduate in 2014			0
i offer you hope on this next part of your life journey			2
it will not be easy , but you can overcome and even thrive			1
my prayers are with you and your families as you come through this horrible ordeal			0
i will never forget what happened to me and will never understand how or why this it had to happen -- but i can not change the past , so i must keep going forward			0
during my kidnapping , i lost my entire identity and could n't remember my real name			2
i wanted to know who i really was and where my parents were			0
i contacted attorney @entity85 , and we decided to go to the media to tell my story in the hope that my parents would contact me			2
that is exactly what happened			0
" @entity94 " aired my story in 2011 , and 37 years after my kidnapping , my real mother found me by seeing me on the show			1
despite being my biological mother , she had to formally adopt me			0
i believe i survived for a reason , in order to keep telling my story and document my own personal healing process			2
the healing process has been difficult but not impossible			2
sometimes the transition from captivity to freedom can be almost as difficult as the transition from freedom to captivity			1
that certainly was the case for me			0
i am truly grateful to be alive and to be able to share with you			0
as you continue to come through your ordeal , just remember to take one day , one hour , one breath at a time			0
you strong , brave women are in my thoughts and prayers			0
peace , love and many blessings , @entity4 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity4 .			1
