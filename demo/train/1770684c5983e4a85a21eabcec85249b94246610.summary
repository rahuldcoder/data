-- @entity1 and @entity3 ' followup to their excellent 2002 " @entity6 " book , " @entity7 , " is an oral history of @entity9 , and its contents have been a closely guarded secret ( @entity13 recently posted some of the book 's juiciest @entity16 sections )			1
until today , that is			2
publisher @entity19 just lifted their embargo , meaning that we can now reveal some details of the much - anticipated project			1
so what 's the big secret ? the book is enormous -- 700 - plus pages of interviews with big names like @entity16 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and many , many more			1
the authors talked to more than 550 people and cover an amazing amount of ground			1
it 's a serious , impressive piece of work , if a little too long and padded out with less - interesting material			1
the book offers a nuanced look at @entity9 , does some top - notch tv - biz reporting on the early days of the cable industry , and offers compelling behind - the - scenes stories about a number of big events ( @entity9 's botched takeover of @entity50 , the creation of the @entity52 , the @entity32 - @entity54 blowup )			1
but what everyone will probably want to talk about , at least for now , is the dirt			2
and there 's a bunch of it : the book is packed with huge egos and bad behavior			1
here are just a few highlights : -- " the company would have @entity67 parties up at some horrible place in @entity70 [ @entity69 , where @entity9 is based ] , " says former general counsel @entity64			1
" a couple of them were drunken orgies ...			2
it became like a big frat party			2
there were a lot of drugs being done in the bathroom			2
there was quite a bit of screwing going on afterward , a lot of it extramarital			2
but everybody went back to business the next workday			2
" -- " there was screwing in the hallways , " says onetime reporter @entity87 of @entity9 's early days			1
" okay , maybe not in the hallways , but there were a couple of stairwell stories ...			2
there were drugs in the building , that i knew			0
there was one guy who dealt pot. " -- at one point in the ' 80s @entity9 kept an apartment in @entity103			1
" i remember [ an @entity9 exec ] coming in and saying , ' we got ta get rid of this apartment ... because the mail boys got a couple of our secretaries hooking over there , ' " says former @entity9 ceo @entity104			1
" hooking ! that 's what he said ...			0
' they 're making money after work when no one 's there			0
it 's getting out of control			0
' " -- sexual harassment was an ongoing issue			0
in the late ' 80s the problem got so bad that anchor @entity125 actually stood up in front of 200 or so people in the cafeteria and demanded that it stop			1
her plea did n't have much impact			0
" no fewer than fifty cases of sexual harassment were reported by women on the staff to @entity9 management in the first half of the 1990s , " the authors write			1
-- @entity16 is hardly the network 's only cranky anchor			0
" i was introduced to [ @entity31 ] , and my title was mentioned , " recalls marketing senior vp @entity140			0
" he was like , ' oh , goddammit , do we need another vice president ? ' and i just said , ' @entity146 to meet you , too , mr. @entity31			0
there was really no need to be a jerk			0
but that kind of stuck with me			0
i noticed that @entity31 was rarely happy			0
he was always very difficult to please			0
" -- the biggest villain in the book ? quite possibly the town of @entity70 , @entity69 , which is apparently so isolated and dull that it drives @entity9 execs who work there to all sorts of boorish behavior			1
" i think part of the sexual harassment stuff was location , " says former @entity9 chairman @entity159			1
" it 's one hundred miles from real civilization , and you got the kind of testosterone , jock mentality , frat house approach that 's pretty much a recipe for stupid decisions being made			0
" or as another exec , @entity171 , puts it , " what a s --- hole			0
i mean , what were they thinking [ locating @entity9 hq there ] ? " that 's just a small sampling of what 's in this huge book , which hits stores on may 24			1
so are you excited to read when it hits stores on tuesday ? what are you most looking forward to finding out ? see full article at @entity0			0
