-- @entity1 has the second largest population of any continent but only accounts for 3 % of global air traffic			1
the reasons for taking such a small share of the aviation market have been the same for decades : poor infrastructure , stalled liberalization , high taxes and fuel charges			0
it also struggles with a lack of routes linking cities , a lack of regular flights flying them and a lack of profitable airlines competing			0
however with the gdp of @entity24 countries expected to grow almost 6 % this year , according to the @entity25 , there is still the belief that aviation can really take - off			1
" the infrastructuure is improving , which was one of the key issues , " says @entity28 , ceo of @entity29			0
" airports , air traffic control , civil aviation regulations everywhere , they are improving , there are many programs coming from international organizations and there is an enormous need for air traffic coming directly from the economic growth			1

a flight between @entity55 in @entity1 and @entity56 , @entity57 , the second fastest growing city in @entity1 , should take six hours			2
yet with no direct flights , the cheapest option via the @entity59 takes up to 25 hours while the faster , yet more expensive routes within @entity1 still take ten hours			2
often governments have been blamed for protecting their national carriers and refusing to deregulate the industry and open up the skies to greater competition			0
while @entity1 has a number of liberalization agreements , its government agrees that more needs to be done " there is a number of constraints in different countries , with regard to policies , with regards to the regulatory environment ... but in terms of the decisions themselves , we have taken the right ones , " says @entity72 , @entity1 's minister for public enterprise			1
" of course , you already have more foreign airlines flying in @entity1 than @entity89 airlines ...			1
but we would like to see even greater cooperation between these @entity89 airlines			1
" @entity92 @entity91 is one airline that is taking note			0
it recently suggested a merger with other local aviation big - hitters , @entity91 and @entity97 airways			0

" we 've all been talking to each other			0
i do n't know if you call it a merger or whatever , ( but it is ) to avoid a situation where we 're running two aircraft @entity111 at 50 % capacity			0
" if there 's a criticism , it is that it is creating less competition on a continent that is crying out for more			0
the real winners so far have been international carriers , particularly from the @entity59 , that now make up almost 60 % of intercontinental traffic to and from @entity1			1
@entity122 has routes from @entity124 to major cities in @entity57 , @entity1 , @entity92 and @entity89 countries and then partners with domestic airlines to reach second and third tier cities			1
" what we are doing is complementing each others networks ... they can take us into 26 points in @entity1 they we 'll never touch , " says @entity130 , ceo of @entity122			2
the greatest test to come then is if the quality of the air links outside the major hubs match the international routes			2
that will prove if @entity89 aviation can ever truly live up to its potential .			2
