[ breaking news update , posted at 10:07 p.m. et ] the @entity2 are going to the @entity3 for the eighth time after defeating the visiting @entity5 45 - 7 in the @entity6 on sunday			1
the @entity2 will play the @entity7 in @entity8 on february 1			1
[ breaking news update , posted at 6:32 p.m. et ] the defending @entity11 champion @entity7 downed the @entity12 28 - 22 in overtime , in sunday 's @entity14			1
the @entity7 , who beat the @entity16 in last year 's @entity11 title game , will face either the @entity5 or the @entity2 in @entity8 on february 1			1
[ previous story , posted at 11:31 a.m. et ] the end is near			2
in two weeks , the @entity3 will be upon us			1
after this grandest of @entity25 sports spectacles , the salad days of basketball and baseball will follow , along with a smattering of other sports , but in the good ol ' @entity25 , we know who is king			2
no , not @entity30 , silly			2
these last two weeks of pro football are what every fan has been waiting for , even as a sinking feeling grows in the pit of each of their stomachs with the realization that after 12 more quarters of football , it 's over till september			2
conversely , wives and girlfriends , and even husbands and boyfriends , will rejoice as the football gods return their beloved -- not to mention her or his attention span -- and weekend productivity will reach peaks unseen since the summer			2
soon , your loved one can finally join you on your @entity57 trip for a second opinion on that bookcase			2
but before you get too excited , you must get through these last 14 days , and what better way to build some goodwill ahead of next month 's @entity57 trip than to show you care what happens ? pretending you care about the @entity3 is easy			1
@entity11 fans are sure everyone cares about the @entity3 , even if you 're secretly hoping the men in tight pants quit throwing the brown " ball " around so you can see more $ 10 million @entity71 commercials			1
conference championships are another story			2
in fact , you may be asking , " what 's a conference championship ? " fear not , you indifferent soul you			2
@entity0 has you covered with five things that will make you look as though you have more than the slightest idea what is happening sunday			2
in the @entity81 , the @entity7 and the @entity12 will face off in @entity82 at 3:05 p.m. et , while the @entity2 and @entity5 will kick off the @entity84 championship in @entity85 , @entity86 , at 6:40 p.m. et. what 's a seahawk ? do n't ask that aloud			1
but they 're the defending champions after stomping the @entity16 in last year 's @entity3			1
want to start a fun conversation over the dip bowl ? ask how it is that @entity16 quarterback @entity95 is always mentioned among the greatest , yet with one exception , always loses at some point in the playoffs			2
after the heated debate dies down , you can say matter - of - factly , " well , at least he has a career in shilling pizza and insurance to fall back on			1
" then , toss some chips in your mouth and walk off			2
it appears @entity108 is not expecting much of a contest in either game			2
both games are predicted to be decided by a touchdown , which is a rather large spread for a conference championship			2
in the regular season , the @entity7 beat the @entity12 by 20 points in week 1 , while the @entity2 beat the @entity5 by 22 in @entity116 , but do n't pay that too much attention			1
weeks can be like dog years in the @entity11			0
@entity82 is a 7 - or 8 - point favorite over @entity12 , which is n't that surprising given @entity82 has been on a tear of late , @entity12 's quarterback is gimpy ( more on that shortly ) and @entity124 is one of the more terrible venues to play in			1
they have this thing called the 12th man , which is actually tens of thousands of astonishingly loud fans			0
they have their own flag , and they do n't care that navy blue and neon green clash			0
@entity2 is also expected to win by 7 , to hear @entity108 tell it			1
the @entity2 have lost only two games since september , and one of those losses -- to the @entity139 on december 28 -- may have been a product of the @entity2 not taking the game too seriously since they had already locked up their division			1
they also have @entity143 ( aka @entity144 ) , who tends to shine in big games , though it should be noted that the @entity2 have lost the last two @entity147 and their last two @entity3			1
@entity12 quarterback @entity148 has been getting it done since week 4 , after telling uneasy @entity12 fans to " relax " after the team got off to a 1 - 2 start			1
the @entity12 have lost only two games since then			1
@entity148 is surrounded by talent , as his offensive line ( the five men resembling redwood trunks who squat in front of the quarterback before each play ) , running back @entity162 and wide receiver @entity163 have been getting it done all season			0
the @entity12 defense is led by @entity167 , who will be looking to disrupt @entity82 's rushing and passing games			1
look for @entity82 running back and @entity171 aficionado @entity170 and quarterback @entity172 , another insurance salesman , to make some big plays -- but in @entity82 , defense reigns			0
you might remember cornerback @entity176 from his abominable sportsmanship after last year 's @entity14 , but also look for safeties @entity178 and @entity180 to be prowling the gridiron			0
especially keep an eye on chancellor			0
it 's possible that he could 've beaten the @entity186 all by himself last week			0
that 's only a slight exaggeration			0
in the @entity6 , you 'll want to watch @entity190 quarterback @entity189			0
he was the first round draft pick in 2012 -- effectively resulting in a @entity5 legend , @entity95 , leaving for @entity16 -- and he 's been showing he is worth the hype , passing for almost 13,000 yards in his first three seasons			1
with little in the way of a running game , you 'll see him using his tight ends a lot , while looking for wide receiver @entity199 to make big plays , something the @entity2 have promised to prevent			1
the @entity2 have a solid defense -- cornerback @entity203 and linebackers @entity204 and @entity206 will look to make life hellish for luck -- but they 're better known for a rounded team effort on offense			1
yes , @entity144 will be looking for the 6 - foot - 6 @entity212 to break free in mismatches , but expect him to spread the ball around plenty , especially to running back @entity216 , who showed his upside in a four - touchdown effort earlier this season ... against the @entity5			1
in @entity82 and the @entity220 area ? oh , most certainly			0
the @entity221 on sunday morning issued a high wind warning for northwest @entity223			0
winds are expected to reach speeds of up to 40 mph , with gusts up to 60 mph , but forecasters predict they will die down before kickoff			0
there 's also about an 80 % chance of rain			0
with the wet and the wind , the kicking and passing games could be tricky for both teams , but the @entity7 and @entity12 have outstanding running backs in @entity170 and @entity162 , so that may make life easier for them			1
on the plus side , it will be in the high 40s or low 50s throughout the game , so they wo n't be battling bitter cold			0
it will be a little colder in @entity85 for the @entity6 , but not much -- somewhere in the mid- 40s			0
the @entity220 area also has a good chance of rain , and winds will be moving at around 15 mph			0
though @entity144 and @entity189 are both skilled ball handlers -- and both ply their trade in chilly locales -- there 's always the possibility that the wind and rain will make for a sloppy game , especially when you consider neither team has the safety net of an awesome running back			0
maybe you 've heard the phase , " @entity148 ' leg , " in recent days ? or perhaps ad nauseam ? yes , it would be hard for even the most disinterested of fans to have missed the news that @entity148 ' calf is torn			0
how badly is unclear , but the @entity7 ' @entity178 has said he is n't buying the line coming out of the @entity12 camp			1
what 's clear is that @entity148 was far from mobile in last week 's game against the @entity275			0
despite @entity148 hobbling around in the pocket , the @entity275 failed to put pressure on him -- especially in the fourth quarter -- as the one - legged wonder completed 24 of 35 passes for 316 yards and tossed three touchdowns			2
do n't expect @entity82 's defensive players to be so merciful			0
expect them to bring the house -- and often -- against @entity148 and try to knock him down on every play			0
and do n't expect the @entity285 to go any easier on his receivers or on @entity162 , who has been complaining of knee soreness ahead of sunday 's matchup			0
in @entity85 , you 'll have a more traditional story line in the old guard versus the new			0
@entity144 , of course , is the poster boy for winners -- and not because of the ugg boots contract and being married to @entity296			0
since coming to the @entity11 in 2001 , he 's played in five @entity3 and won three of them			1
this will be his ninth afc championship game			0
but remember , he 's lost his last two conference championships and his last two @entity3 , so do n't be surprised when commentators wonder aloud if @entity189 , 25 , who has taken the @entity5 to the playoffs in each of his three seasons , is ready to take the crown from the 37 - year - old @entity144 's head			1
