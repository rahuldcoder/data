the killings of 12 journalists and others at @entity3 in @entity4 has led many to wonder about the role of @entity8 in fueling vicious attacks on civilians in the name of the religion			0
policymakers wring their hands about how to curtail the spread of extremist religious ideologies that terrorize @entity18 targets , but also @entity19 and non-muslim minorities in the @entity21 , who are extremism 's primary victims			2
where are some @entity19 getting the idea that violence against journalists who offend them is ok ? why do they see beheadings as a fitting punishment ? a good place to look for answers would be to examine @entity33 's policies of intolerance and extremism			1
@entity39 , as the protector of @entity8 's most sacred religious sites and leader of @entity33 , is widely considered an important role model for @entity19 around the world			1
so it should not come as a surprise that many @entity19 take their cues from the country on the prohibitions and punishments they consider appropriate to inflict on those who challenge or disagree with their interpretations of @entity8			0
@entity33 gave a good indication of its position on appropriate punishments last friday , when it carried out round 1 of a public flogging -- 50 lashes -- against @entity56 , a young blogger , in front of the @entity59 mosque in @entity60			1
a @entity33 court had fined @entity56 and sentenced him in 2014 to 1,000 lashes over 20 sessions and to 10 years in prison for the crime of " insulting @entity8 " -- in part for setting up a liberal website to debate various topics , including religion			1
@entity56 is not the only @entity33 who has faced punishment for his perceived views			1
the government has jailed many leading intellectuals , writers , and activists who have dared to question any tenet of the orthodoxy imposed by the country 's @entity80 religious leaders			0
a former colleague of @entity56 , @entity83 , was jailed in late 2014 on charges of " insulting the messenger and the hadith " in connection with tweets that allegedly criticized religious authorities			0
in october , a @entity33 court sentenced a @entity92 cleric , @entity91 , to death for criticizing the government and " breaking allegiance with the ruler			1
" the prosecutor had sought what the @entity33 call a crucifixion sentence , the kingdom 's harshest , in which the convicted person is beheaded and the decapitated body displayed in public			1
there is so much shock and outrage about @entity109 propaganda videotapes showing its beheadings of journalists in @entity112 and @entity113 -- and most recently , the reported beheadings of two @entity116 journalists in @entity117			0
but the much more routine and widespread beheadings by @entity33 get little scrutiny and condemnation			1
@entity33 beheaded at least 26 people last august alone			2
the 82 executions in 2014 make @entity33 a world leader in capital punishment			1
@entity33 @entity126 news releases indicate that about half of them were for nonviolent crimes , the other half for drug offenses and one for sorcery			2
yes , you read that right			0
in 2014 , @entity33 was still beheading people for " sorcery			2
" so is it really any surprise that extremist groups -- also acting in the name of @entity8 -- seem to be following @entity33 's lead , meting out their own severe punishments against journalists and activists they find offensive ? if @entity33 thinks publicly beheading people comports with @entity8 religious teachings and deters those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion , why should n't isis ? one might argue that a nation , unlike some self - designated @entity147 , has the legitimacy and authority to exercise state - sponsored violence , including against its own citizens			1
but countries also have obligations to respect human rights			0
@entity33 's abusive prosecutions and cruel punishments flout these obligations , and undermine its own legitimacy			1
there is probably little governments and policymakers can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups			0
but there 's a lot more they can and should do to influence the policies and practices of purported allies in the " war on terror			0
" that includes the @entity174 coalition , to which @entity33 and many other unaccountable , authoritarian , and deeply abusive @entity176 governments belong			2
while the @entity180 and @entity181 governments ' statements condemning @entity56 's flogging were a good start , more often these countries are utterly silent in the face of @entity33 's grotesque abuses against its own citizens			1
the @entity18 's denunciations of @entity109 abuses have less credibility when governments carrying out similar abuses , if much smaller in scale and magnitude , are good chums , strong allies , and important investors			2
if the international community is serious about taking on @entity198 extremist ideologies -- if it wants to see real models of tolerance , respect for diverse viewpoints , religious freedom , and the free and peaceful exchange of ideas â€” it must urge @entity39 to be the true protector of the rights of @entity19 around the world			0
for a start , he can overturn the sentence against @entity56 and release dozens of detained activists and writers			0
he could even abolish beheadings , overnight , if that is what he wanted			0

@entity219 : @entity221 's flogging most recent example of @entity33 's extreme punishment
she says on *jihad* violence , easy to connect dots to @entity33 , region 's model for *repression*
@entity219 : @entity180 *slammed* flogging by its ally , but is silent on routine , grotesque abuses of @entity33 citizens
