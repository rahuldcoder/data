after @entity1 won his inaugural @entity3 race in 2010 in @entity4 , he became the latest star of the @entity6			1
the young , insurgent candidate was so impressive , talk of a presidential future quickly ensued			2
he entered the @entity3 with high expectations , having won his race with the support of the new tea party movement while simultaneously appealing to mainstream conservatives			0
but his journey has not been without roadblocks			0
leadership on controversial topics has slowed his rise			0
now , @entity1 , 43 , is working to right his perceived wrongs and shed his stereotypes as takes up the mantle once adorned by doing the work to launch a presidential run			1
boosting his presence the freshman senator is doing all the things necessary to make himself known			0
he 's traveling to early presidential nominating states , heading overseas to beef up his foreign policy credentials , appearing on national tv to boost his name recognition and formulating policy ideas to demonstrate substance			1
on wednesday , he delivered a " major address " on economic mobility and challenges facing the middle class			1
little new came from it			0
it was a culmination of previously announced ideas and legislation he 's already introduced this year and weaved in personal stories of childhood poverty as the son of @entity48 immigrants and accounts of people struggling to make it in the middle class			2
" too many are starting to believe the @entity55 is no longer possible for people like them , " he said			0
@entity58 , @entity1 's spokesman , said the senator has been developing these ideas " for months , " since the 50th anniversary of the @entity62 earlier this year			1
it 's a comprehensive speech but one that could be delivered on the floor of the @entity3 , a place where any of the 100 members go to offer their policy prescriptions			2
instead , @entity1 's speech was aimed at garnering as much attention and clout as possible			1
in an attempt to appeal to the right , he spoke a few blocks from @entity74 at conservative @entity75 , which stresses the teaching of " constitutional principles			0
" a coordinated media campaign that includes post-speech interviews is geared toward bolstering the significance of the speech			2
an alternative @entity1 's efforts to raise his profile and prove his substance is also an effort at differentiating himself from @entity87			1
his economic address comes the same week that president @entity90 's summit on working families and the @entity93 conference in @entity94 that focused on jobs and the economy			1
it was attended by former secretary of state and potential @entity87 presidential candidate @entity99			0
@entity99 on wealth missteps : ' my record speaks for itself ' @entity1 's address contrasted the ideas they presented and , instead , took up themes @entity87 have largely rejected , including a private option for @entity108 and gradually raising the retirement age for @entity110			1
they are popular ideas within the @entity6 that would arguably save federal dollars			2
on jobs and economic mobility , @entity1 detailed his ideas that include tax reform and tax credits for mothers obtaining an education and income - based student loan payments			1
he also backed a reduction of regulations and taxes and the repeal of @entity125 that he says prohibits employers from hiring , a far different platform from his @entity87 counterparts			0
@entity129 , a former adviser to 2012 presidential candidate @entity130 , said @entity1 is trying to fill a void			1
" he recognizes the @entity6 is very hungry for leaders who want to serve as a counterpoint to president @entity90 on the big policy issues , " he said			1
to beef up his foreign policy resume , the member of the @entity138 has put himself out front on related matters			0
he appeared on the sunday talk shows to discuss the @entity143 response to the chaos in @entity145 where he backed air strikes , a position @entity90 has n't pursued			0
a crowded field but to get where he 'll contrast his ideas against a @entity87 presidential candidate , he needs to differentiate himself from his fellow @entity6			1
@entity1 is doing what other potential presidential candidates have done			1
sen. @entity154 has delivered numerous policy speeches throughout the country ; gov. @entity157 has been active outside @entity158 in his role as head of the @entity161 ; former @entity4 governor @entity160 has begun strategically appearing at national conferences			1
they , and a dozen other potential candidates , have also traveled to early nominating states of @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
@entity154 : will his star continue to rise ? there lies the problem : @entity1 is just one of many climbers trying to reach the same summit			2
as many as four governors , three senators , a former senator and two former governors are contemplating a 2016 run			0
@entity1 faces a difficult slog to rise above the noise that the @entity6 race is already making			1
in a june @entity184 poll , @entity1 pulled 8 % among potential @entity6 presidential candidates			1
his support is low , but he fell smack in the middle of the large pack and not much worse than the most popular potential candidate , @entity154 , who garnered 14 %			0
in a fractured @entity6 that consists of social conservatives , fiscal conservatives , tea party activists and pragmatists , @entity1 will have to find his niche			1
@entity1 's rising star after he won his @entity3 race , @entity1 was the face of the tea party			1
he was considered one of the more conservative to enter the @entity3			0
but as the @entity6 establishment struggled to embrace the tea party , he became the glue			2
party leaders saw potential and a future in @entity1			2
he 's young , he 's @entity206 and he 's telegenic			0
" it 's a great day for the conservative cause			0
new people with new thinking , new ideas -- 21st century solutions , " @entity160 said immediately after his victory			0
but politics is a volatile profession			0
@entity1 's folly @entity1 's stock within the @entity6 plummeted last year when he held up the mantle for the @entity6 on immigration reform			1
he was part of a group of eight senators that forged an agreement , leading to the passage of comprehensive immigration reform			2
while he was dubbed " the @entity231 " by @entity227 for his work on a solution that has been unable to pass @entity230 for nearly a decade , conservatives called the bill amnesty for undocumented immigrants and conservative @entity234 called @entity1 a " disappointment " on his blog @entity237			2
" while some of us will be able to forgive @entity1 's rather rapid shift toward the very position he once vocally opposed , others probably will not be so forgiving , " @entity234 wrote			1
@entity243 , ceo of @entity244 , a social conservative organization in @entity166 that has a large amount of political influence in the critical presidential caucus state , said people " really backed away " from @entity1 after immigration			1
@entity1 , he said , is going to have to explain himself to @entity166 republicans			1
@entity166 voters are " a very discerning lot , " @entity243 said			0
" they 're willing to forgive			0
they 're willing to try to understand			0
" although his immigration position was likely to appeal to independent voters and even @entity87 , the outrage proved the position was unpopular among the base , which he needs in a presidential primary			1
after the immigration fallout , @entity1 felt the heat and backed away from the national spotlight			1
he laid low and made little noise			0
@entity1 's return @entity1 has mostly avoided the topic of immigration except to pivot away from the bill he helped pass through the @entity3 by endorsing a fragmented approach in the @entity6 - led @entity271			1
he maintained his latest stance again wednesday when he said a solution for the millions of undocumented immigrants ca n't happen before the border is secure and a worker verification system is in place			0
since 2014 rolled around , @entity1 has been carefully crafting his image as a well - rounded , versatile leader in the @entity6			1
he has repeatedly appeared on the business channel @entity281 to discuss economic policies without mentioning immigration			2
a smart move , @entity129 said , because " it 's dangerous when you make your name on one issue			0
" @entity129 , who has been watching his campaign , said @entity1 is making the right moves , not only in the policy arena but the political one , too			1
" he 's not making 2014 about @entity1 but making it about candidates across the country , " @entity129 said			2
@entity1 was the first of the possible presidential candidates to endorse @entity3 candidate @entity298			2
he traveled to the state to fundraise and campaign for her			0
his endorsement and her subsequent win helps him build relationships and a national infrastructure in critical states			0
now @entity1 has the long , treacherous trek of finding the voters who support him			2
" slow and steady wins the race , " @entity129 said			0
how many ways can @entity130 say no to 2016 ?			0

@entity4 sen. @entity1 is giving a major economic policy address
it 's part of a larger coordinated strategy to prepare for a presidential run
one challenge is being noticed among the many other republicans considering
his lead on immigration caused discernment among the @entity6 base
