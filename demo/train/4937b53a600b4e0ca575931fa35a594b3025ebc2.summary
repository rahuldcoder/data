-- @entity3 formula one world champion @entity1 has warned his 2013 title rivals that @entity5 are in better shape than this time 12 months ago			1
@entity5 driver @entity1 edged out @entity8 's @entity7 at the final race of the 2012 season to clinch a third successive drivers ' title by just three points , while his team celebrated a third constructors ' crown in a row			1
@entity1 , the sport 's youngest ever three - time champion , insists the whole team is focused on matching last year 's achievements			1
" what we have is more or less the same car that we had in @entity29 ( the final race of the 2012 season ) -- with some steps forward , " the 25 - year - old told @entity23 's official website after taking to the track at a preseason testing event in @entity26			1
" but from a personal level i can say that i am much happier now than i was one year ago			0
" the @entity33 also dismissed suggestions he might struggle for motivation ahead of the 2013 season			1
" thank @entity38 i do n't have to think about something like ' finding motivation ! ' " added @entity1			2
" sure it was nice what we 've achieved in the last three years and it makes us all proud , but i would say that i am still in a phase of my life where i look forward , and that 's the right direction to go			0
" last season began in unpredictable fashion , with an unprecedented seven different drivers winning the season 's opening seven races			2
it was an uncharacteristically slow start to year from @entity5 , with @entity1 winning the year 's fourth grand prix in @entity56 but then not picking up a second success until september 's race in @entity59			1
" i do n't think it will be much different from what was important last year -- again it will be very close , so it will not be a case of two or three drivers fighting it out , " continued @entity1			2
" in the first half of the season i expect a very similar situation to 2012 where we saw many different winners			0
then , in the second half , some favourites will become visible			0
" to be one of them you have to score points at every race and be consistent -- that was what got us the title in 2012			0
" @entity7 , a two - time drivers ' champions , made first appearance of preseason in @entity87 on tuesday , but @entity1 remains focus on ensuring @entity5 arrive at the season - opening @entity90 @entity89 on march 17 in the best possible shape			1
" when you drive and you see another car on the track it is almost impossible to notice details , from whatever car , " said @entity1			0
" this is much easier when you look at photos			0
to be honest right now we are still in the phase where we are fully concentrating on ourselves , not looking left and right			0
