-- " @entity1 has failed " is a mantra often heard in policy and media circles these days			0
but not only is the phrase outdated ( the 1980s called -- they want their slogan back ) , it is far too simplistic to describe both current drug policy and its outcomes			2
the latest incarnation of this ill - advised saying can be found in a report arguing that since cannabis and heroin prices have fallen while their purity has increased , efforts to curb drug use and its supply are doomed to failure			1
this leads some to highlight the possibility of alternatives in the form of " regulation " ( e.g. , legalization ) of drugs			1
but a closer look at the data -- and the implications for a policy change to legalization -- should give us pause if we care about the dire consequences drug addiction has on society			1
globally , drug use has been stable over the past decade , though it is difficult to paint such a broad brush across countries and substances			1
but in the @entity44 alone , there has been a 40 % drop in cocaine use since 2006 and a 68 % decrease in workplace positive cocaine tests			0
overall in the @entity44 , all drug use has fallen by about 30 % since 1979			2
there are likely numerous reasons for this drop , but we ca n't ignore the fact that the world 's top supplier of the drug -- @entity56 -- has greatly improved its security situation over the same period			2
with help from the @entity44 , @entity56 has managed to reduce the amount of land dedicated to coca growing by nearly two - thirds from 2000 to 2010			0
potential production of cocaine has also fallen more than 60 % , though in places without such security enhancements -- namely @entity68 and @entity69 -- cocaine production has picked up			0
still , this shows that progress is not only possible , it is happening			0
as for the opiates and cannabis , trends vary widely in different regions around the world			0
while critics are right to say that prices have fallen while potency has risen generally , globally the picture is much more mixed ( the global cultivation of poppy has actually fallen since 1997 worldwide )			2
in policy analysis , the key question that must follow any sentence that says " x policy is good / bad " is : " compared to what ? " some have offered legalization as a possible alternative			2
but we know from our experience with currently legal drugs -- prescription drugs ( which are now the leading cause of accidental deaths in the @entity44 ) , alcohol and tobacco -- that legality means commercialization , normalization and wider access and availability that lead to more use and addiction			1
legalization in the @entity44 is likely to accompany a bombardment of promotion , similar to our other three classes of legal drugs			1
these industries will stop at nothing to increase addiction since their bottom line relies on it			1
in fact , we know that 80 % of the profit from addictive industries comes from the 20 % of users who consume most of the volume of the substance			0
according to internal documents that the government forced @entity122 to release during its historic court settlement , those companies are ready to pounce on the golden opportunity of drug legalization			1
it is no wonder that the parent company of @entity129 , @entity130 , recently bought the domain names " @entity132 " and " @entity133			0
" if this sounds frightening , it should be			0
@entity122 tried for decades to conceal the harms of their drug , and millions of lives were lost as a result			2
we are naive to think that this would n't happen with any other drug that is legalized			0
where does that leave us ? that legalization is not a solution does not mean we have to be content with the status quo			1
proven interventions such as community - based drug prevention efforts , drug treatment courts , offender re-entry programs and probation reform should be more robustly implemented and taken to scale			0
it is shameful that the richest country in the world ca n't figure out a way to make drug treatment available to all who need it , and we must stop relying on incarceration to deal with the drug problem			1
interestingly , though , according to criminologist @entity165 , if all drug prisoners were released tomorrow , we would still have four times the number of people in prison than our historical incarceration rate instead of five			0
that tells me that the root causes of drug use , trafficking and crime , must be seriously tackled			0
on the other hand , legalization -- especially in ad - obsessed @entity44 -- would not only sweep the causes of drug use under the rug , it would open the floodgates to more addiction , suffering and costs than we could ever bargain for			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			1

a report says *cheaper* , purer *illegal* substances suggest *war* on drugs is failing
@entity187 : actually , global drug use has been stable over the past decade
he says some think legalization is the solution , but that would lead to more drug use
@entity187 : legalization means companies will try to increase addiction to make more money
