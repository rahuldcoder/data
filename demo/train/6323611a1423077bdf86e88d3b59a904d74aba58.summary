he does n't trust @entity1 , vows it wo n't get nuclear weapons , and believes past rhetoric by its leaders threatening annihilation of @entity7 is unacceptable and kind of insane			1
so why is secretary of state @entity8 so adamant about getting time to try to negotiate an agreement that would further curb @entity1 's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions ? the former @entity13 spent 2 1/2 hours at a @entity14 hearing on tuesday defending the international negotiations last month that brought an interim deal with @entity1 intended to lead to a comprehensive agreement after six months			1
facing skeptical legislators from both parties , @entity8 tried to assure them that he shares their mistrust of @entity1 while asking that they halt the drive for new sanctions for now to give negotiations , which also involve the other permanent members of the @entity26 and @entity27 , a chance to succeed			1
he bristled when yet another @entity30 legislator , rep. @entity29 of @entity31 , described the @entity33 position as giving @entity1 the benefit of the doubt by not requiring the dismantling of all centrifuges needed to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons			1
" i sat here and said we 're skeptical			2
i sat here and said they 've got to prove it , " @entity8 responded , adding " there 's no benefit of any doubt here			2
" his takeaway message borrowed from former president @entity50 's " trust but verify " guideline for a weapons deal with the @entity53 , but @entity8 modified it to reflect the lack of trust in @entity58 's intentions			1
" @entity67 and verify , " he said repeatedly in describing restrictions on @entity1 's program in the interim agreement , as well as the necessary monitoring and testing for a final agreement acceptable to president @entity65 that would ensure @entity1 would be unable to develop nukes			1
a bipartisan group of @entity13 is working on new sanctions legislation and the @entity14 may consider a similar measure , prompted by concern that the interim agreement eased some sanctions without achieving the goal of ridding @entity1 of its centrifuges and other technology needed to build a nuclear bomb			2
however , the interim deal reached last month in @entity79 prohibits new sanctions , and @entity8 argued tuesday that such a step was unnecessary at this point			1
" they know that if they fail , sanctions will be increased , " @entity8 said of @entity1			1
" we 've said it a hundred times and you all have said it a hundred times and they know you 're yearning to go do it but you do n't need to do it			0
it is actually gratuitous in the context of this situation because you can do it in a week if you need to when we say , ' this ai n't working , we need your help , ' and believe me we 'll be prepared to do that			0
" on @entity103 visit , @entity8 sees hope of progress for @entity1 , @entity7 after @entity8 's remarks tuesday , the chairman of the @entity107 said the panel would hold off on considering new sanctions legislation for now			1
the statement by @entity113 sen. @entity112 of @entity114 left open the possibility of @entity107 leaders taking up the bill without having it go through the committee			0
earlier , @entity8 declared that " @entity1 will not acquire a nuclear weapon , " calling the stance the centerpiece of president @entity65 's foreign policy			1
the interim agreement eases some $ 7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of @entity1 's nuclear program , @entity8 told the committee			1
@entity7 opposes that deal because it allows @entity1 -- a longtime enemy of the jewish state -- to continue enriching uranium needed to develop nuclear weapons			1
prime minister @entity135 has made clear that @entity7 would attack @entity1 's nuclear facilities if it felt threatened , and the negotiations are considered an effort to avoid a possible military confrontation in the volatile @entity103			1
in @entity142 , legislators from both parties agree that tougher measures are needed			0
" we are facing an immoral and very dangerous regime in @entity1 , one nearing a nuclear weapon , " rep. @entity144 , the @entity14 's @entity30 chairman , said at tuesday 's hearing			1
" i am hard pressed to understand why we 'd be letting up sanctions pressure at the very time its economy is on the ropes without getting an agreement which stops its centrifuges from spinning			0
" others used more graphic language , with @entity30 rep. @entity156 of @entity157 comparing @entity1 's threats against @entity7 to @entity27			1
" what can you say to @entity7 and the rest of our allies in the @entity103 to convince them that @entity33 is still a reliable ally , that @entity33 will enforce agreements with @entity1 or else , and that @entity33 is not ignoring history and repeating the 1930s @entity169 - like pattern of appeasement and retreat that helped trigger @entity172 and the death of tens of millions of people around the world ? " @entity156 asked			2
@entity8 responded by " condemning in the strongest language possible those expressions of hate and of , you know , sheer and utter insanity , almost , asking for a country to be wiped off the face of the map			2
" " that language is the most abhorrent kind of language you can find in any discourse of public life , " he said			0
" it has no place in a reasonable world			0
it 's unacceptable , and we should never hear that kind of language again			0
" @entity1 officials have long said the country 's nuclear intentions were peaceful			2
they also warned any new sanctions would scuttle the interim agreement , noting that language in the document specifies no new ones can occur			0
@entity65 said over the weekend that he would accept a peaceful nuclear program in @entity1 , including modest uranium enrichment			0
however , @entity144 said the key issue is whether an eventual final agreement negotiated on the world stage with @entity1 would permit it to " manufacture nuclear fuel			0
" " unfortunately , the interim agreement raises some questions about this , " he said			0
" my concern is that we may have bargained away our fundamental position , which is enshrined in six @entity218 -- and that fundamental agreement is that @entity1 should not be enriching and reprocessing			0
we may bargain that away for a false confidence that we can effectively check @entity1 's " misuse of the nuclear weapons technologies			2
@entity30 rep. @entity225 of @entity226 said the @entity1 " can get all the nuclear material they need for power by purchasing it from other countries , " adding that " they do n't need to enrich it themselves			2
" @entity8 stopped short of declaring a final agreement with @entity1 would prevent any uranium enrichment capability for @entity58 , saying such details must be worked out			1
he noted that the interim agreement reached last month requires full consensus on such matters			0
to legislators calling for more sanctions , @entity8 said economic strictures alone had failed to prevent @entity1 from expanding its centrifuges in recent years as it made progress toward developing a nuclear weapon			1
" the issue here is what are we going to do about it so we do n't have a sudden breakout , " he said , adding that the interim agreement is a step toward that			0
" in order to weaponize , you have to have highly enriched uranium			0
under the agreement , they ca n't have highly enriched uranium			0
" @entity144 , though , noted that @entity1 has " a history of deceiving the international community about its nuclear program , and is pursuing a ballistic missile program in violation of @entity218 , " adding that it " simply ca n't be trusted with enrichment technology , because verification efforts can never be foolproof			0

" we 're skeptical , " @entity8 says of @entity1 's intentions
