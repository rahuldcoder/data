-- great tennis rivals @entity2 and @entity3 will lock horns once again in saturday 's semifinals of the @entity7 event in @entity8			1
@entity2 , seeking to reach the final for the first time since 2006 when he won it for the third year in a row , was first into the last four as he added another milestone to his illustrious cv			1
the former world no. 1 thrashed ninth seed @entity18 6 - 3 6 - 2 on friday to become the first man to win 250 matches in masters 1000 level tournaments			1
last year 's runner - up @entity3 then overcame another @entity23 -- former world no. 3 @entity24 -- despite dropping his first set of the @entity27 hard - court event in a 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 4 victory			1
" they 're always special matches , especially because they 're always in very important matches for both of us , " said @entity3 , who beat @entity2 in the @entity30 semifinals in january to move 18 - 9 ahead in career meetings			1
" that always makes the match very special			0
but even if it 's not the final , being in the semifinals is an important match			1
" playing against @entity2 always means a little bit more than against the rest of the opponents because i am playing probably against the best of the history , and because i played probably the most important matches of my career against him and probably him against me			1
that 's why it makes the match a little bit more special than the rest			2
" @entity2 and @entity18 were both seeking their 20th victories of this year , but the 16 - time grand slam champion comfortably won for the fourth time in 2012 against the man who beat him in the 2009 @entity62 final			1
" i sort of expected myself to come out and play a good match today after the struggle i had against @entity66 , " the 30 - year - old said			2
" i do n't usually struggle back - to - back days , so this was for me a really good match against a great player			0
i 'm happy i was able to maintain the great streak i 've got going against him this year			0
" @entity2 has won 37 of his last 39 matches , the other loss coming to @entity74 in the @entity75 while playing for @entity76			2
home hope @entity74 plays defending champion and world no. 1 @entity79 in the first of saturday 's semifinals			1
he is bidding to become the first @entity27 @entity84 player to triumph in the @entity85 since @entity86 in 2001			0
but the 26 - year - old is 0 - 2 against @entity30 champion @entity79			2
meanwhile , top - ranked @entity88 will play world no. 2 @entity89 in sunday 's women 's final in @entity7			1
@entity88 extended her unbeaten run to 22 matches , surpassing @entity95 ' start to 2003 , as she beat @entity97 18th seed @entity98 6 - 4 6 - 3 to claim the best beginning to a campaign since @entity101 went 37 - 0 in 1997			2
" i 'm really impressed by the way @entity106 was playing , " @entity88 said of her opponent , who has reached seven semifinals in her last 11 events			2
" it was the first time we played on the pro tour , so it was a little bit new for me , and she showed some excellent tennis			0
i think she 's a great player and she really pushed me to raise my level and really dig to win that match			0
" @entity89 , the 2006 champion in @entity7 , had easier progress to the final as her opponent -- fellow former no. 1 @entity117 -- retired with a hip injury while trailing 6 - 4 0 - 1			1
@entity117 won the tournament in 2008 and was runner - up the following year , but the @entity121 has slipped to 16th in the rankings			0
" i started to feel it in the middle of the first set , " she said			0
" it just got gradually worse and worse			0
i started to feel a lot of pain through my glute and could n't load on my backhand side			0
" after the treatment it was getting worse and worse rapidly			0
we taped it and i tried to continue , but i could n't even stand there on my return			0
" @entity89 lost to @entity88 in january 's @entity30 final , and the @entity138 will be seeking to prevent her @entity140 rival from winning a fourth title in 2012			1
" she 's definitely the one to beat right now , someone that 's playing with a lot of confidence and all the momentum in the world , " @entity89 said			1
" i 'd love to get my revenge from @entity148 and play much better , as well			0
in our previous meetings we had really tough matches and i hope the quality of tennis will be good and hopefully i can change a few things around this time			0
