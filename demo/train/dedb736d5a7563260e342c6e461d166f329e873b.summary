-- @entity2 's supreme leader said friday the @entity4 republic is n't seeking and does n't believe in pursuing nuclear bombs			1
ayatollah @entity6 made the remarks a day after a draft report from the @entity10 nuclear watchdog said @entity2 may be working secretly to develop a nuclear warhead for a missile			1
" @entity2 will not get emotional in its response to these nonsensical statements , because we have often said that our religious tenets and beliefs consider these kinds of weapons of mass destruction to be symbols of genocide and are , therefore , forbidden and considered to be haram ( religiously banned ) , " he said			0
" this is why we do not believe in atomic bombs and weapons and do not seek them			1
" the ayatollah 's remarks reflect the tensions between the @entity30 and @entity2 over its nuclear program			1
the @entity33 and its allies fear that @entity2 aims to develop the capacity to build a nuclear bomb			0
@entity2 denies this , saying its nuclear program is designed solely to produce civilian energy and for medical use			1
the document is the first draft report by the @entity43 director general , @entity42 , who replaced @entity44 late last year			1
it has not been approved by its board of governors , but the agency has expressed concerns over the years about @entity2 's nuclear activities			1
the draft report lists ways in which the @entity4 state is allegedly defying @entity10 orders about its nuclear program			1
it said @entity2 had begun enriching uranium to a level that can sustain a nuclear reaction before @entity43 inspectors arrived to monitor the process , and in defiance of a request not to do so			1
in @entity63 , assistant secretary of state @entity62 said on thursday the draft report is the first produced by the @entity43 since the recent discovery of a secret nuclear facility at @entity67			1
" there is no explanation for that facility that is consistent with the needs of a civilian nuclear program , " he said			2
" and it characterizes the way in which @entity2 has conducted its ... relations with the @entity43 and its failure to satisfactorily explain , you know , what its activities and ambitions are in the nuclear sphere			2
" @entity62 called the conclusions of the draft report " consistent " with arguments secretary of state @entity85 made this week in the @entity86			2
" we have ongoing concerns about @entity2 's activities , " @entity62 told reporters			2
" we can not explain why it refuses to come to the table and engage constructively to answer the questions that have been raised , and you have to draw some conclusions from that			0
" the draft report highlighted concerns about rising tensions in the @entity86 , particularly between @entity2 and @entity100			1
@entity100 has often been the object of rhetoric by @entity2 president @entity103 , who has said the jewish state " must be wiped off the map " politically			0
the @entity33 has assured @entity100 that its interests will be protected			0
former @entity43 weapons inspector @entity107 told @entity0 thursday that @entity2 's behavior " has to make you worry more about a [ potential ] conflict			1
" @entity2 appears to be " pushing " for concessions from @entity114 powers , he said			0
" they 're pushing on things that make them look like they 're going for nuclear weapons , and that 's risky			0
if they go much further , they may bring an attack on themselves by @entity100			0
@entity2 needs to be a little more careful about its actions			0
" @entity126 , a nuclear proliferation analyst at the @entity128 , told @entity0 that , " in a sense , we should be pleased by this			0
... having such a clear statement from an international body can only help develop a robust international response			0
" on tuesday , @entity103 warned the @entity33 and other nations not to impose tougher sanctions in reaction to @entity2 's nuclear ambitions			2
he said recently that @entity2 will boost uranium enrichment to 20 percent			2
" it 's high time for some people to open their eyes and adapt themselves to real changes that are under way , " he told reporters in @entity140			0
the draft report became public on the same day that @entity33 vice president @entity147 gave a speech in @entity63 warning about the dangers of nuclear proliferation			2
" the spread of nuclear weapons is the greatest threat facing the country -- and i would argue facing humanity -- and that is why we are working both to stop their proliferation and eventually to eliminate them , " @entity147 said in remarks at @entity152 .			0
