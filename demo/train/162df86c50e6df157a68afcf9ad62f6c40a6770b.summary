@entity1 , @entity0 -- picture this : the @entity6 champions and current highest - ranked soccer team in the world , @entity4 , are beaten 3 - 0 ... by a team of robots			1
on the way : robots are developing steadily towards the goal of beating humans at football			1
it may sound ridiculous , but robot developers in @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity6 are dreaming of that very goal			0
working under the umbrella organizations @entity24 ( federation of @entity26 ) and the @entity25 , researchers and developers are aiming to advance robot technology to the point that a team of humanoids can beat the best humans in the sport by 2050			1
since robot soccer competitions began in the mid- 1990s , researchers have already made significant developments towards their goal			1
@entity37 of the @entity38 at the @entity39 told @entity2 that the first robots in competition were controlled by humans and many were on wheels or four - legged , but that is changing			1
" since 2007 the team have progressed to bipedal robots that have cameras on board , " he said			1
" our robots are autonomous -- they have no control from outside sources			2
the cameras try to work out where the goal is , where the ball is and where the other players are			0
" further robotic developments appear to be close			2
researchers at @entity61 released a study in the march 2009 online edition of ' @entity64 with applications , ' showing they had refined a technique known as machine - learning			2
basically , the scientists were able to teach a virtual player simple reactions to visual stimuli -- based upon how real humans react in the same situation			1
do you think robots will one day be able to beat humans at football ? sound off box below			1
this year robots will go head - to - head at both the @entity25 event in @entity82 in june / july and the @entity83 in @entity84 in august			1
the most advanced classes at present are the bipedal classes for ' humanoid ' robots			2
co-chair of @entity25 2009 , @entity90 , told @entity2 this year 's event was the 13th edition of the cup , and he was impressed by progress by advances since the competitions began			1
" at the last @entity25 in @entity98 2008 we had games of teams of three humanoid playing attractive soccer			1
they walk on two feet , fight for the ball and of course score ... so we are approaching the goal , " he said			0
@entity37 said interest in both events had steadily grown , especially since the two - legged robots had been introduced			1
this year up to 3,000 competitors from 40 countries are expected at @entity25			1
" this has been extremely effective in gaining interest			0
these are much more exciting to watch			0
we have seen a steep level of change in interest from not just young people but everybody			0
" despite the increasing profile , @entity37 said there are still plenty of major challenges before the humanoids can seriously compete with humans			2
" this is still a long way from competing against humans			1
the next big challenge to be met is to get robots walking like humans and then running like humans			1
" one of the most challenging things is getting a robot to walk on uneven terrain without falling over , " he said , explaining that some fall over after kicking at goal			0
( although , it 's not hard to think of professional footballers who have suffered the same problem			2
) the @entity39 team is currently researching how robot 's feet can be improved , and hope to release a concept later this year that could usher in a new era of in foot design			1
for @entity90 , the critical issues are that of perception and cognitive abilities			0
" perception is one of our major problems			0
it is important that a robot is able to understand a scene like a human does			0
if you enter a complete unknown room you are able to recognize the important things like furniture and also relations and functions of objects very fast , " he said			0
" despite huge progress in this area we are far behind the capabilities of animals or humans			2
" and of course there 's cognitive capabilities			2
to reason about new , uncertain or even inconsistent facts is easy for a human but very hard for a robot , " @entity90 said			0
size and cost are other limiting issues			0
" in order to make this affordable we are developing robots 50 to 60 centimeters high			0
at that size each robot costs about 10,000 pounds to make			0
at full human size each would cost about 50,000 pounds , " @entity37 said			0
soccer is an ideal testing ground for robotics as it encompasses many different elements including movement , vision and strategy , @entity90 said			1
but the applications developed in these robots could serve a greater purpose			0
@entity90 said robot technologies could be used for entertainment or performing simple tasks around the home and office			0
they also could be used in rescue scenarios -- where robots could be sent into dangerous situations in place of humans , he said .			2

@entity24 and @entity25 organizations promoting development of robots
robots have been competing in regular soccer contests since the mid- ' 90s
scientists hope to be able to beat world 's top team of humans by 2050
robotics developments tested in robo - soccer have uses in other fields
