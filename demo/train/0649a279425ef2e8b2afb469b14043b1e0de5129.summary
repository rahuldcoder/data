-- @entity1 : an adjective meaning " leaf - bearing " or , alternately , " the word that exiled me to the oft - fabled @entity6 at the 1986 @entity7 in @entity8 " strangely , i did n't mind ; i 'd already gotten my prize			1
very few of us are lovely on the outside at age 13 , and even less so are those of us inclined toward worrying words down to their etymological nubbins			1
my light - socket perm , train track braces and penchant for unicorn sweatshirts were n't doing me any favors when it came to feeling at ease among my peers back home			1
yes , i 'd gotten attention from the local press , glossy plaques , a pep rally at my @entity28 , @entity29 , school and , creepily enough , an obscene phone call -- all accolades for my ascent through regional bee wins			2
however , i 'd have gladly traded every scrap of that for a chance to feel like one of the girls who knew how to give herself @entity40 - in highlights and flirt adorably with the boys on the basketball team			1
that was until i met @entity44			2
upon arrival at the @entity48 hotel , spellers were issued a blue , plastic - bound autograph book as impetus to mingle with our fellow contenders			1
after some initial hesitation , i actually began to enjoy the ritual of handing over the little talisman , scribbling something silly in the the book they 'd handed me in return , then trading back and madly flipping through to see what they 'd written to me			1
i liked @entity44 right away			0
she was " bee royalty " -- a brash , third - time competitor from @entity65 , @entity66 , prone to yelling things like " nuke the @entity68 ! " and quoting @entity71 comedy shows			1
as she doodled an elaborate self - portrait that filled a whole page in the back of the book , she gave me the lay of the land			1
that kid over there -- rumor had it his family had hired a professional coach to prep him			0
that girl -- home - schooled			1
do n't look for her at any of the mixers or day trips			1
her mom was going to keep her locked in the hotel room , cramming until the very last second			0
@entity91 kicked off wednesday @entity44 , herself , was n't going to be skimping on socializing and sightseeing , but she was going to sequester herself for some last - minute studying in the hopes of making one last run at the title in her final year of eligibility			1
and oddly -- very oddly -- for me , a kid prone to gut - grinding panic attacks , self - flagellation over academic success and generally ill at ease in my own skin , i began to sink into calm			1
i was n't , for once , the dorkiest girl in the room , and instead was surrounded by kids who lived for language play , lovely books , good grades and a life of the mind			1
i 'd suddenly found my people			0
and while there was n't a gawky little ghost of a chance that i was going to beat them in the bee this year , i was cool with that			2
my cool lasted until we hit the ballroom stage the next day and a few hundred terrified , raw - nerved elementary school kids with pasteboard number signs around our necks had to stand in front of cameras from every major national news organization and spell words that i could have sworn the announcers were making up on the spot : gobemouche , phaeochrous , exiguous			1
many kids hemmed , hawed , begged , borrowed and stole time with requests for definitions , etymologies , sentence use			2
i just went for it			0
machine ( duh ! )			0
@entity141 ( a word i shoehorn into conversation as frequently as possible )			0
i think there 's another round i 'm still blocking out			0
and then : " @entity1			0
" " could you repeat that ? " " @entity1			0
" " uh ... @entity148			0
my head , now freed of its duties for the day , floated somewhere off into the middle distance , and i trudged off to the @entity6 where some well - meaning volunteers offered tissues , cookies and hugs to spellers whose dreams had been shattered			2
i opted for the cookie and went off to apologize to my dad , who 'd spent a goodly amount of his evenings on my training			0
that 's ok , he assured me			0
he was just excited that we 'd get to go to more museums			0
did i want to hit the @entity168 now ? i 'd wanted to go to that museum for ages , but instead , i took my place in the audience and watched my friend @entity44 battle through several more rounds before butting up against , i believe the word was , " dentifrice			2
" she joined me in the ballroom , kibitzing at my side as speller 102 , @entity181 of @entity182 , @entity183 , took home top honors for " odontalgia " - a fancy word for toothache			1
@entity44 grumbled that she totally could have gotten that one			0
@entity181 went on tv to visit @entity192 and spell against @entity193 , where i 'm happy to say , one of @entity197 's bandmates spelled " phyllophorous " incorrectly			0
@entity181 got cash prizes and a place in the history books			2
i got a weird , funny friend who kind of understood me			1
and that was o - k - a - y with me .			2

@entity204 went to the @entity7 at age 13 in 1986
back home , she was an outsider with light - socket perm , train track braces
now she was with kids who lived for language play , lovely books , good grades
@entity204 did n't win trophy , but won a friend who kind of understood her
