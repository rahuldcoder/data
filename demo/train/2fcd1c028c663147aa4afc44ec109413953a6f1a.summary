-- instead of opining on the proposed deal with @entity2 taking shape in @entity4 , let 's decode it			1
from the reported outline of the proposal , we learn four things : 1 ) @entity2 remains intensely committed to achieving a nuclear weapon			1
@entity2 's new president , @entity12 , promised his countrymen relief from international sanctions			1
since coming into office this summer , he has made various conciliatory noises			0
was he readying @entity2 for a real deal ? the message of @entity4 is : no , no real deal			1
@entity2 's red line at @entity4 , the thing it would not trade away , was a capacity to continue and resume nuclear bomb development at any time			1
@entity2 's offer at @entity4 amounted to a six - month delay of its nuclear program that will not in any way impair its ability to get back to bomb - making at any time			1
@entity2 wo n't neutralize or surrender any of its fissile material ; that is , material used to fuel reactorsâ € ” or nuclear bombs			1
it wo n't disable any of its nuclear facilities			0
economists use the phrase " revealed preference " to describe the way in which our actions indicate our priorities			0
@entity2 's priority remains gaining a weapon ; @entity47 , there can be no doubt about that			1
2 ) the @entity2 economy has collapsed into desperate condition			1
at @entity4 , @entity2 gained a promise of the potential release of $ 3 billion in frozen international reserves and the right to import potentially up to $ 9.5 billion of gold			1
for a major oil producing nation , these should be petty sums			0
( @entity60 's oil revenues amounted to about $ 7 billion per month in 2013			0
) @entity2 itself holds title to an estimated $ 80 billion of international reserves			2
the @entity65 sanctions passed by @entity66 at the end of last year , then reluctantly accepted by the @entity69 administration , have effectively denied @entity2 the use of these funds			2
any bank anywhere in the world that deals with @entity2 will be cut off from the international payments system			2
if @entity2 earns $ 1 billion inside a sanctions - busting country , it must either buy goods worth $ 1 billion inside that country or else find a way to physically move that much cash -- assuming the sanctions - busting country has that much physical cash , which few do			2
( a billion dollars in cash would fill all the carrying space on a large truck			0
) a study conducted for the @entity90 by @entity91 estimates that @entity2 's actual on - hand , accessible foreign reserves have dwindled below $ 20 billion , and maybe further			2
this amount could cover only three months worth of minimally essential imports , a level that would normally be considered a warning of crisis ahead			0
in @entity2 's case , however , the crisis has already arrived			2
in just the past two years , the rial has plunged from 10,800 to the dollar to about 32,000 to the dollar			0
prices have soared , and goods have vanished from @entity2 's shelves			2
by any usual definition of the word " desperate , " @entity2 desperately needs a deal on its nuclear program			1
if @entity2 still wo n't yield , that is one more confirmation of point 1			2
3 ) the @entity69 administration wants an @entity2 nuclear deal more than @entity2 does			1
by most reports , it was the @entity114 that came to @entity4 armed with proposals , and @entity2 that did most of the refusing			1
as @entity116 and @entity117 reported in the @entity118 last week , the @entity69 administration began relaxing sanctions simply to get talks started			0
@entity2 , by contrast , has offered no such concessions to the @entity114			1
since the breakdown of the talks last week , @entity2 has insisted on its willingness to walk away if it does not gain a deal to its liking			1
secretary of state @entity128 - by contrast again - has blitzed the media , defending the agreement as better than nothing at all			0
@entity2 is the country more willing to live with the failure of the talks			2
its worst - case scenario at @entity4 is more sanctions , more economic privation , more public discontent , and more need for political repression			2
this last is not an outcome that need frighten the regime very much : the mullahs crushed protests in 2003 and 2009 and there 's no reason to doubt that they can crush any future protest equally effectively			0
the @entity69 administration seems much more frightened of its worst - case outcome : the need to use military force to stop the @entity2 nuclear program			1
compared with that scenario , it seems to prefer any deal , no matter how flimsy or one - sided			0
and the @entity2 seem to understand that preference			0
4 ) @entity114 's allies are not deferring to @entity114 leadership on this one			0
it 's not only @entity159 that has rebelled against the outlined deal in @entity4			1
@entity161 is protesting vocally and publicly ; @entity114 's @entity163 allies are protesting less publicly , but nearly equally vocally			0
on " @entity164 " on sunday , @entity128 insisted that there was " zero gap " between the @entity114 and its regional allies			0
then he immediately got on a plane to the @entity169 on sunday , presumably to try to upgrade his sunday talk - show words into something closer to reality			0
just in case , though , the @entity169 will also be buying $ 4 billion worth of @entity114 munitions -- its own private line of defense against a threatening @entity2 and the turmoil that will ensue if @entity114 's deal - at - all - costs mentality compels @entity161 to strike @entity2 on its own			1
as of today , you have to guess that it 's that latter scenario that looks like the most likely outcome of @entity114 over-eagerness			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 says no real deal with @entity2 came out of @entity4
@entity2 still wants a nuclear weapon , he says
@entity114 is more *interested* in a deal than @entity2 , @entity185 says
