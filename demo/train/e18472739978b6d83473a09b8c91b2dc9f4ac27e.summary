-- @entity1 ? @entity2 ? be glad that some of our favorite quick - service places evolved into what they are today			2
when @entity8 decided to go into business , they really wanted to make bagels			1
but the equipment required to make bagels was rather expensive , so they researched a cheaper product and settled on ice cream			1
although they 've released plenty of other breakfast - related ice cream flavors -- @entity20 among them -- they have yet to create a lox and bagel - flavor			1
maybe it 's in production ? 2			0
@entity27 , the founder of @entity28 ( who knew the " @entity27 " represented a person ? ) , started his career in the fast food business with a meager hot dog stand			1
it did so well that he sold it and opened a bigger and better stand , and he started selling tacos for 19 cents out of a side window			1
before long , the hot dogs were playing second banana to the tacos , and @entity27 decided to switch the business			1
@entity0 : 10 secret fast food menu items 3			1
what if @entity43 ' timbits actually referred to chicken nuggets ? it could have gone that way -- the ex-hockey player originally focused his post pro-sports career on hamburgers and opened a few burger joints in @entity52 and @entity53			1
they did n't do so well			0
they retooled the concept and reopened as a small doughnut shop housed in an old gas station , selling coffee for 25 cents and doughnuts for 69 cents per dozen			1
today , @entity43 employs 100,000 people and has more than 3,000 stores ( mostly in @entity63 , but the company is expanding into the @entity65 ) 4			0
what if @entity67 had a fleet of vehicles that drove around like the ice cream man , selling sweet , sweet carbs to anyone who could scrounge up some change ? well , they used to , sort of			1
after working for just such an ice cream company , @entity75 used his war bonds and borrowed some money to start a mobile catering business that delivered breakfast and lunch to factory workers			1
he noticed that his best sellers by far were coffee and doughnuts , and decided to base the whole business around them			1
seems to have worked out ok			0
( i still like the idea of doughnuts coming to me , though			1
on the other hand , @entity90 , who created @entity91 , started out in the doughnut biz and ended up in poultry			1
he sold his car to purchase a @entity97 franchise from his brother and then decided to fry chicken instead of crullers			0
the first one failed , even with the tagline " so fast you get your chicken before you get your change			2
" but the second version succeeded , making him a multimillionaire			0
the name , by the way , came from @entity111 from " @entity112 " -- not @entity113			0
@entity0 : 15 companies that originally sold something else 6			2
how about a @entity2 ? the founder , @entity115 , had big plans for an upscale steak eatery when he originally entered the restaurant business			1
he opened a small diner called @entity121 's @entity120 to generate revenue for the bigger steakhouse and realized somewhere in the middle of things that he was making a load of money selling just root beer , hamburgers and hot dogs every week			2
he decided to stick with the low - brow menu and scrap the sirloin			0
@entity133 , obviously the founder of @entity134 's , ran several inn - style restaurants in @entity137 and took that time to study the habits of his patrons			2
he got rid of the inns and opened his first quick - service place , selling 15 - cent hamburgers under the @entity134 's name until the chain was purchased by @entity145 in 1997			2
speaking of @entity145 , @entity146 came from similar humble beginnings			0
like a lot of the great fast - food giants , @entity146 started with a hot dog stand he and his wife purchased by taking a $ 311 loan out on their car			1
somehow , i do n't think @entity158 biting into a big , juicy tamale would have had quite the same effect as @entity158 biting into a big , juicy six dollar @entity161 , do you ? 9			0
@entity163 started out as @entity164 ( now @entity165 ) , a full - service restaurant housed in a tiny little building with a tiny little door			2
the original can still be found in @entity170 , @entity171 , complete with diminutive door ( it has a regular door as well )			0
what might be shocking to @entity163 die - hards is that the @entity176 offer steakburgers and hamburgers			0
gasp ! ! what would the " @entity163 " cows think ? ! @entity0 : was there really a @entity182 ? fruit and veggie origins 10			0
finally , of course , there 's @entity188 's			0
like our other frankfurter entrepreneurs , @entity189 and @entity188 started with a mere hot dog stand in @entity193 , @entity194			2
they upgraded , but burgers were n't really their main focus -- they planned to capitalize on their delicious bbq			2
several years later , they noticed that burgers were the item keeping the store alive and decided to switch exclusively to burgers , shakes , and fries			0
these days , i suppose they do a little bit of all of that , and more ( yes , even the @entity211 )			0
