the name @entity1 conjures visions of rhinestone - studded trucker hats , colorful cartoon skulls , dragons and koi fish , and reality stars like @entity8 and the cast of @entity10			2
a profitable licensing deal with @entity13 businessman @entity12 put @entity1 's work on clothing , energy drinks , fragrances and even tanning lotions			1
it seemed like the deal of a lifetime , but in hindsight , @entity1 said , the agreement made his name synonymous with the " douches " of pop culture and ultimately cheapened his personal brand			1
now , he is stepping out from behind the large shadow of the @entity1 brand to set the record straight in " @entity31 : my life in @entity33 , " a memoir released in june			1
co-written with biographer @entity35 , the book shares how @entity1 went from college - educated fine artist to tattoo pioneer to one of the most polarizing brands in recent memory			1
" people began globally to know my images , my name and my signature , but they did n't know there was a real person behind it , " @entity1 told @entity42			2
from skin to canvas @entity52 was born in @entity53 , @entity54 , and his mother began to encourage him to draw when he was 3			0
as a preteen , he took pens and colored pencils to the skin of neighborhood friends and became an amateur tattoo artist in his neighborhood			1
he had his first exhibition at the @entity64 after graduating high school and attended the @entity66			0
after turning down a graduate position at the @entity68 , according to his memoir , he met and began a correspondence with famed tattoo artist " @entity71 " @entity72 in 1969			1
he went on to study in @entity73 with legendary tattoo artist @entity74 , working with clients from the infamous yakuza , or @entity73 mafia			1
both men influenced the heraldic aesthetic that defines @entity1 's signature ornate images today			0
he opened his @entity82 tattoo shop , @entity83 , in 1977 and is credited with helping transform tattooing from a mark of sailors and prisoners to a mainstream option for self - expression			0
his 1995 gallery show , " @entity91 and @entity92 : a century of drawings in tattoos , " prompted a @entity94 article that asked whether tattooing could be fine art. @entity42 : understand the risks and precautions of tattoos @entity1 's forays into clothing started with silkscreen shirts bearing his artwork for sale in his shop			2
in 2003 , the artist was approached by two men who saw his work in @entity113 art magazine			0
the two ran @entity115 , an @entity117 - influenced casual wear brand , and they became the first to put @entity1 's images on clothing			1
@entity13 fashion businessman @entity12 came across the shirts and approached @entity1 to do a licensing deal that would make him " a global phenomenon , " @entity1 wrote in the book			1
@entity1 said he and an associate met @entity12 and signed over the master license to much of his artwork , allowing @entity12 to produce items featuring the images			1
this deal turned out to be enormously profitable			0
by 2009 , sales exceeded $ 700 million for the brand , according to the book , and @entity1 's work could soon be seen everywhere			2
the brand 's omnipresence was enhanced by famous fans			0
at its height , @entity1 clothing could be seen on celebrities from @entity140 and @entity141 to cast members of " @entity10 " and @entity8 of the " @entity143 " reality show			1
@entity8 infamously donned @entity1 - printed shirts in public appearances with alleged mistress @entity147 , and visited @entity13 to meet with @entity12			1
@entity1 said the character associations ruined the brand 's reputation , and even wrote in the book that a @entity153 's buyer mentioned @entity8 when the line was dropped from @entity153 's stores			1
@entity1 had no problem saying , " @entity160 dehumanized it , " when asked about his views on public distaste of the @entity1 brand			1
he maintained that the clothes and imagery were not to blame for the brand 's downfall , but pointed to @entity12 's aggressive love of celebrities , which @entity1 said tainted his image and his name			1
according to the book , @entity12 pocketed a lot of the profits that came from sub-licensing @entity1 's images to several companies that produced lifestyle - related products , and even began altering the images			1
the two soon landed in court , and the tattoo artist found himself spending time perusing legal documents instead of creating art until an undisclosed settlement was reached in 2009			1
attempts to reach @entity12 were unsuccessful			0
from must - have to must - hate @entity182 , creative ambassador - at - large for @entity185 's @entity184 , surprised many by praising the @entity1 line in the @entity188 in 2009			2
" criticizing @entity1 for being cheesy is like saying that @entity189 was ' flashy ' or that @entity190 was ' tacky , ' " @entity182 wrote			0
" it 's a giant case of @entity192 ! of course it 's cheesy ! that 's the whole point , you doo - doo heads			0
@entity1 is fromage - y and hedonistic and naughty and badass and — the ultimate crime in the world of haute fashion — @entity1 is fun ! " @entity182 compared the rise of @entity1 clothing to " the gaudy heyday of @entity204			2
" so why would people buy something " fromage - y " like @entity1 apparel ? " it gave regular people @entity213 edge , and gave @entity213 people street edge , " celebrity stylist @entity209 said			0
today , however , the brand " represents bad taste , " he said			0
" it went too far and all over the place at once			0
" this could explain why there 's a " hating people who wear @entity1 " @entity224 group with more than 1,800 members , and a @entity227 sketch titled " the @entity228 " with less - than - likeable characters who go on misadventures to protect the @entity1 brand name from rival clothing lines			1
the blog @entity235 lists " hating people who wear @entity1 " as item 124			0
a @entity239 nightclub even banned the line , with a sign on its door that read " if it 's on @entity10 it 's not coming through the door : no @entity244 , no @entity1 , @entity245 , @entity246			2
" @entity1 said he thought partnering with @entity12 would give him time to work on his art. he did n't expect success and the infamy it eventually created			1
celebrity fashion labels : the good , the bad and the ugly " @entity255 and overexposure " can kill a brand , said @entity252 , director at @entity253 , a fashion retail and consulting company			0
popular brands can quickly fall from grace if their public exposure is n't strategically managed			0
answering the " many entities that knock on the door " can be bad for business , @entity252 said , noting that designers may choose to wait five or more years before signing licensing deals , because it allows them to be strategic with market penetration			0
@entity1 said @entity12 's widespread licensing aspired to make the brand more accessible to people at every price point			1
that strategy backfired , as the brand became what @entity209 described as " very trailer park			0
" " they made it too unexclusive , " he said			0
" no one wants to be in something that everyone has			0
" both @entity209 and @entity252 said the brand would have to wait several years before a successful comeback is tangible			0
@entity1 noted that the master license was taken on by @entity283 in 2011 , which also represents the @entity285 brand and @entity140 's @entity287 line			2
the group has plans to develop the label , which @entity1 said is still popular in @entity117 and other countries			2
the stories behind your favorite fashions back to the drawing board though he completed his last tattoo in 2008 , @entity1 is still an active artist who splits his time between @entity82 and @entity298 and mentors artists of @entity83 , now run by his son , @entity300			2
this month , he 'll travel to @entity301 to show a 30 - painting exhibition of his original artwork			0
although @entity1 said he might have done things differently if given the chance , he also admitted that it was surreal to see his name and art become so well - known			2
with this memoir , @entity1 aims to convince the public that despite the infamy of his eponymous brand , he is and has always been an artist .			1

@entity1 , the tattoo artist behind popular clothing line of the same name , released memoir in june
@entity1 signed a deal giving @entity12 rights to produce products with his art
once the height of popularity , the @entity1 empire fell from favor *due* to overexposure
@entity1 is still making art and wants the public to know he is more than the clothing brand
