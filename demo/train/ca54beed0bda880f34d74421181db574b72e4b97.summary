-- @entity1 is heading to an " intolerable situation " according to @entity4 's hyperactive foreign minister @entity3 , whose country is at the forefront of global efforts to engineer the downfall of the @entity10 leadership			1
less than two years ago , relations were diametrically different			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity12 considered @entity10 a close friend and paraded @entity1 as the epitome of its much vaunted but now defunct " zero problems with the neighbors " policy to encourage rapprochement with @entity21 nations			1
trade across their 850 - kilometer border blossomed tenfold , security cooperation against the @entity25 -- a militant @entity27 group conducting a violent separatist campaign in @entity4 -- flourished and mutual visa restrictions were lifted			2
this transformation in ties should not be surprising in retrospect			0
for @entity4 and @entity1 never enjoyed a strategic relationship as much as a convergence of interests triggered by the @entity37 war in 2003 to stymie an independent @entity27 in northern @entity37			1
similarly , both leaderships found common cause against @entity40			0
their relationship was merely tactical and psychological bereft of common values			0
then the eruption of the @entity46 awakening upended the stability in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and eventually @entity1 thereby unleashing long simmering sectarian tensions to the surface			2
@entity10 's security and intelligence forces dominated by fellow minority @entity55 ( a syncretic and mystical offshoot of @entity58 ) confronted a largely @entity60 popular revolt			0
@entity12 , a devout @entity61 , did not hesitate to side with the @entity63 masses			1
gone are the days where @entity4 defended @entity67 nuclear endeavors and cooperated closely with it on @entity37			2
in its stead , @entity4 patched once frosty relations with @entity71 jointly calling on @entity10 to resign , solidified the partnership with @entity73 and adopted a more muscular and robust approach towards @entity67			2
@entity71 's cooperation with regional players such as @entity4 is a good example of what @entity79 secretary of state @entity78 coined " smart power " in play to avoid committing scarce resources in money and soldiers as it disengages from @entity86 and @entity37			1
@entity4 's @entity63 inclination stems from its sectarian sympathies with the @entity1 protesters , its desire to project @entity4 influence in the @entity21 and to restrain the regional ambitions of rival @entity67			1
on the other hand , the @entity79 seeks to degrade the @entity67 nuclear program and to guarantee the security of @entity40 and the @entity73			0
despite the toughening rhetoric against @entity100 , there is no hiding the fact that @entity4 's choices are severely limited			1
@entity104 and @entity105 will thwart further @entity107 initiatives , the @entity103 looks exhausted , and the positions of the @entity110 and @entity63 alliances are entrenched			2
at the heart of stalemate is the future of the @entity10 dynasty			0
@entity4 and its friends strongly favor regime change while @entity10 and his allies demand regime stability			1
how to square this conundrum is testing the limits of @entity4 diplomacy			2
one possibility -- which is most favored by @entity4 -- is a negotiated solution			2
@entity124 proposed on wednesday an international conference to end the violence in @entity1			1
yet , it seems highly unlikely that procedural fixes will paper over clashing objectives			0
negotiations require an abundance of goodwill and a willingness to compromise , two commodities in short supply			0
that leaves the most risky option of a slippery slope to further escalation on the ground			0
@entity4 is already hosting the @entity141 and the @entity142 of breakaway @entity1 military personnel			1
further measures could include unifying the hopelessly fragmented @entity1 opposition and providing additional logistical and other support to @entity1 armed groups			2
most perilous of all is @entity4 unilaterally establishing a security zone or a safe haven on @entity1 territory with the backing of the @entity79 , @entity153 powers and the @entity73 but outside the @entity107 purview			1
this would drag @entity4 ever deeper into the @entity1 quagmire that is descending into a sectarian civil war			1
after all , the turmoil in @entity1 can easily spill over into an ethnically and religiously diverse @entity4			1
direct military intervention will also pit @entity4 against an angry @entity104 and a hostile @entity67 supplying collectively two - thirds of @entity4 's energy needs			1
@entity162 is seething after @entity124 agreed to host in september last year a sophisticated @entity79 early warning radar system under the @entity165 umbrella to neutralize the threat of long - range @entity67 missiles			0
@entity4 is undoubtedly in a precarious and unenviable spot at the mercy of unpredictable and deteriorating regional circumstances			0
it is not in control of events but is being controlled by events			0
what the ultimate outcome will be is anyone 's guess			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

@entity181 says @entity4 has *abandoned* its friendship with @entity1 in wake of violence
he says the change in position is *unsurprising* , given @entity4 's lack of strategic links to @entity1
he says @entity4 's prime minister @entity12 lost no time in siding with @entity1 's @entity63 masses
