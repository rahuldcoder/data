a few days ago , when @entity3 journalist @entity2 posted on @entity4 an apparently unretouched photo of supermodel @entity6 , she launched a firestorm of debate over what women 's bodies should look like as they get older			1
the image showed the 48 - year - old @entity13 looking sultry , but imperfect , in black lingerie , her bared stomach and thighs characterized by what appears to be some cellulite , wrinkles and sun damage			1
" @entity22 , mrs. c , " @entity2 tweeted			2
to many , this was a welcome change from photos of the latest celebrity who 'd gone the cosmetic surgery route			0
over the last year , when @entity30 stars like @entity31 and @entity32 appeared in public with new faces , there was speculation that they got plastic surgery and the public reacted with harsh judgment			0
so it 's no surprise that when photo of @entity13 was shared all over social media , many people commended @entity2 for making it public and @entity13 for having " the guts " to open herself up to such scrutiny			1
@entity2 told @entity1 , " women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes			2
i think it 's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like			0
" but the photo was not , it turns out , from @entity63 , as @entity2 acknowledged			1
it 's an unpublished outtake from a 2013 photo shoot from @entity66 and @entity67 , which is owned by a different publisher			2
the image was shared by @entity2 without @entity13 's knowledge or permission			1
the irony here , of course , is that @entity2 took ownership of an objectified version of @entity13 's body in exactly the same way she set out to criticize others of doing			1
@entity2 said to @entity1 , " i want people to feel like magazines are n't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies , but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images			2
... no one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body			0
" and yet , is n't that exactly what @entity2 did ? @entity13 lingerie image stirs debate over what ' real women ' look like if @entity2 had done her journalistic due diligence , should n't she have made sure the woman in the photo actually felt comfortable having such an intimate photo of herself broadcast to the world ? @entity2 does n't know how @entity13 feels about that image , and we still do n't know			1
( the supermodel has not yet commented on the photo			2
) in releasing the image , @entity2 made an example of one woman 's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more " realistic " images of women			1
on " @entity115 , " @entity2 said , " i thought i would tweet the picture because i found it incredibly empowering to see someone as beautiful and iconic as @entity6 in her natural form			1
" to be sure , there is some comfort to be found in that photo			0
one of the world 's most famous models has cellulite ! one of the most recognizable female icons grows old and ages just like the rest of us ! but in praising this photo , are we implicitly saying that we respect the aging process only when it mirrors our own or when it shows some imperfections ? after all , what we like here is that @entity6 , in fact , does n't look all that amazing , and to say she does resonates as more than a little condescending			1
she is beautiful , to be sure , but what we 're celebrating as " real " are her flaws			0
the release of the photo and the response it has generated is quite the opposite of inspiring			0
the message it seems to convey is that the only way we celebrate a woman 's aging body is when we bear witness to its flaws			0
after all , we call women like 32 - year - old @entity152 model @entity151 , who released photos of her toned body four weeks after giving birth , " vain , " " insecure , " and " attention - seeking " because we do n't find any comfort in seeing those photos			0
so let 's call a spade a spade			0
we do n't like @entity13 's image because it 's " real			1
" we like it because it 's a little startling and a little unattractive , and therefore makes us feel better about ourselves			2
but that is n't what empowerment is -- using others ' faults to downplay or justify our own			0
we 're also not cheering @entity13 's bravery in showing the world what even the most genetically blessed 50 - year - old women look like , since the photo was very likely shared without her permission			1
we 're using her to make ourselves feel better			0
which , of course , could not be more unattractive .			0
