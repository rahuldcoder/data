-- a line of angry protesters waving signs and wearing scows formed a ring around the front entrance of the @entity8 ' headquarters			2
they took turns at the bullhorn accusing the paper of everything from libel to genocide			2
they did n't bring a list of demands ; they were n't looking to negotiate			2
they had one goal : to shut the paper down forever			2
" we 're going to march until the walls come down , " one shouted			2
employees who would normally head out the revolving door to one of the lunch trucks along @entity29 developed a taste for cafeteria food that day			2
@entity32 , senior editor of the newspaper they had pledged to kill , walked out the front entrance and met their scows with a broad smile			1
picketers committed to the complete destruction of the @entity8 returned his smile or nodded in recognition as they passed him			2
a few even shook his hand			2
i 'll never forget that scene			0
it was , at once , improbable yet typical of a man who was as comfortable in the salons of power as he was in the embrace of the disadvantaged			0
@entity32 was the last man you 'd pick out of a lineup of guys suspected of aiding and abetting dangerous felons			1
in his horn - rimmed glasses , hand - tied , silk bowties and graying crew cut , he looked like a grown - up version of the nerds that tough guys used to beat up to burnish their reps			0
but fugitives who were wanted for vicious assaults and heinous crimes would call @entity32 before they called their lawyers			1
in a town where some cops were known to administer curbside justice , surrendering to @entity32 was a way to keep from having their faces rearranged on the way to jail			1
at least 75 fugitives did just that over @entity32 's 19 - year career			1
in 1981 , he negotiated the release of six prison guards being held hostage by a band of armed inmates whose leader was doing life for killing a cop			0
prisoners guards and a remarkably composed @entity32 emerged unscathed from the two - day ordeal			1
his departure in 1991 ended a 19 - year run as the most influential columnist in town			0
@entity32 's courtly manners and air of refinement could disarm the unwary			1
but the @entity8 knew what they were getting when they hired him in 1972			0
@entity96 had once dubbed him " the angry man of the negro press			0
" @entity99 was a target - rich environment in 1972			1
@entity101 , a former police commissioner who had once left a formal dinner in a tuxedo to supervise the public strip search of a group of unarmed @entity106 , had been elected mayor			1
@entity32 began his @entity8 tenure in time to see four @entity110 members , including the city council president get ensnared in the @entity113 net			1
in a one - party town where an inbred @entity117 machine reigned supreme , @entity32 was like a kid in a candy shop			1
he attacked police brutality , political corruption , the chronic failure of public schools and institutional injustice twice a week in the @entity8 and weekly on his aptly - named tv show , " on @entity126 "			2
he was the @entity8 ' first black columnist			0
but he never saw color when he was looking through his gun sights			0
he described @entity129 , the city 's first black mayor , as a " paternalistic ferret			0
" when state rep. @entity132 was the most - powerful black politician in the state capital , @entity32 called him " an oleaginous eel			1
" the @entity136 language was a sharp tool in his hands			0
he described one of his targets as a " retromingent , " a term for an animal who urinates backward			0
but he could be effusive in praise			0
he originated the @entity146 , an honor named for a cop known for the kind of firm but fair police work which @entity32 advocated			1
his death on april 6 at age 89 ended a lifetime of service			1
he was trained as a @entity155 in a segregated @entity156 in @entity157			1
he had worked overseas for an international aid organization in the ' 50s			0
in the ' 60s , he was a special assistant to @entity160 rep. @entity159 and later authored three books			0
he ended his career as a professor of journalism at the @entity164 at @entity165 , before retiring five years ago			0
perhaps his most lasting legacy is as a founder of the @entity168			1
@entity169 , a @entity170 - winning columnist and @entity168 co-founder once described him as the first amongst equals in founding @entity168			1
" there were a lot of us in the room , " @entity169 told me			0
" but @entity32 was the one holding the clipboard			1
" join us on @entity181 / @entity180 .			0
