-- season four of " @entity2 " has featured some of the most brutal scenes in the popular series ' history			1
( yes , that 's a warning for those behind on the show			2
@entity10 ahead ! ) there was the gut - wrenching death of @entity13 in the midseason finale , but there was also the burning death of @entity17 and @entity18 early on			1
it was a mystery who killed them , but it soon came out that @entity22 ( @entity23 ) did it to stop them from spreading a deadly disease through the prison			1
when @entity29 learned what happened , he banished @entity22 from the prison , but she reappeared in the second half of the season			1
young sisters @entity35 and @entity36 were left under @entity22 's care after their father died , but it became clear that @entity35 had a skewed sense of right and wrong , and she killed her younger sister to bring her back as a walker			1
then @entity22 decided yet again that another survivor was too dangerous to live and shot @entity35 in the back of the head			1
the reaction to this episode was huge			0
with @entity23 at the center of some of this season 's more memorable scenes , @entity0 spoke to her about @entity22 's evolution and the finale sunday night			1
@entity0 : what was your initial reaction when you learned what @entity22 was going to have to do this season ? @entity23 : it was surprising to me that @entity22 was going in this direction , absolutely			1
but it also made a great deal of sense to me that they would take her in this direction			0
first of all it 's a very interesting arc for this character , considering that she 's lost her daughter ; she carries so much responsibility for that , and also ( she 's ) trying to navigate this world			2
@entity0 : is this the most challenging acting role you 've ever had ? @entity23 : by far			1
this has been by far the most difficult , and certainly the longest - running			2
the most challenging and rewarding , for all the same reasons			0
@entity0 : there was a powerful response online to the deaths of @entity35 and @entity36 ; did you follow that reaction at all ? @entity23 : yeah , i was really happy about the responses that came from that episode			2
shooting that episode was remarkable and such a great experience			0
it all just came together in such a wonderful way			0
people talk about how " it needs to be earned			0
" i felt what was necessary in this episode was absolutely earned			0
the emotional and critical response has been wonderful			0
the fans have just been phenomenal in their appreciation for that episode			0
what ultimately happened in that episode was controversial , but i feel like it was handled with such a sensitive approach			0
the build - up to it was just handled so well			2
@entity0 : have you seen the memes that have cropped up about the scene ? the line " look at the flowers " has taken on a life of its own			0
@entity23 : people are pasting people 's faces over @entity35 's in the flower bed ! ( @entity112 ) that 's another thing i love about the fanbase : they have a great sense of humor			1
... i 'm a spoofy kind of person			0
i appreciate the humor , and it 's a great way to offset the devastation that people on the show ( are ) going through -- it 's sometimes very refreshing to see that stuff			2
@entity0 : there 's a segment of fans who like the idea of @entity130 and @entity22 together			1
they have n't had too many scenes together this season , but is that something you might be pulling for ? @entity23 : i know that @entity22 and @entity130 have a tremendous bond			1
personally , i am living vicariously through the fans , i guess			0
for some people , watching the show , it 's a fun element for them			2
they 're very passionate about their ' ships ! @entity0 : how do you react to the show 's massive popularity ? @entity23 : i 'm constantly amazed by the amount of different types of people that are aware of the show			1
after the episode with the girls , a gentleman who is 73 years old -- he said , " i 've never written a piece of fan mail ever , but i had to write how much i enjoyed that episode			0
" it touched me so much			0
when i think of how far - reaching this show is , and how big it is , it 's like trying to fathom the beginning of time , and i have to stop			2
@entity0 : what 's your favorite thing coming out of the show ? @entity23 : it certainly has to be the relationships within the cast and crew , and getting to work with the people i do			1
it 's so tremendously fulfilling , and personally getting to play this character has been a dream			0
@entity0 : what can fans expect from the season finale ? @entity23 : there 's nothing i can say that has n't already been said ! like every finale , ( whispers ) it 's gon na be crazy !			1
