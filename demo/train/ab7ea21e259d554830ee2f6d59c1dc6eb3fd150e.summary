off a main street in @entity1 , standing outside a high walled compound is an old @entity4 security guard , manning the front gate			1
walking towards him is a group of well - dressed students in gray and maroon uniforms -- almost looking out of place in this dusty , garbage - littered , rundown city			0
inside are large trees surrounding a deep rose - colored two - storey building , and all you can hear is music			0
this is the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , which has been up and running for the past two and a half years			1
it has 141 students , of whom 41 are girls , and half the placements go to children who are street kids or orphans			1
officials believe there are 70,000 street kids in @entity1 and as many as 600,000 across the country			1
three generations addicted to opium in one of the dozen practice rooms on the ground floor is 15 - year - old @entity35			0
she lost both her parents several years ago and has been living in an orphanage ever since			2
she is now one of a handful of students learning to play the sarod -- a traditional @entity42 instrument that is making a revival in @entity4 thanks to this school			1
" music is very important to me because it 's my future			0
it saved me , " she said			0
" i want to teach other students , especially young girls			0
i know my country has a lot of problems but i hope for peace so girls in @entity4 can do what they dream of doing			1
" across the hall in another practice room is 16 - year - old @entity58			0
he 's playing the piano			0
with a look of determination and purpose he reads the music , his fingers moving across the keys			0
listening to him , you would think this teenager had been playing for most of his life			0
in fact he 'd never touched a piano until two years ago			2
" i was working on the street selling plastic bags and chewing gum , " he said			2
" my family is very poor			0
now i go to school and study music			2
something i never thought i would do			0
" skateboard school ramps up @entity4 dreams the man responsible for turning his life around is the founder of @entity19 , @entity81			1
the son of a famous @entity4 composer , conductor and musician , @entity81 wanted to change lives through the power of music			1
though he was born and raised in @entity1 , he has very close ties to @entity90 after seeking asylum there when he fled the @entity93			1
the @entity95 militant movement seized power in 1996 following @entity4 's long civil war			1
while in @entity90 , @entity81 studied music -- receiving his phd in music from @entity101 in @entity102			1
his wife and two children still live there			2
he returns every three months and will be heading back again at the end of the year for his daughter 's wedding			0
but he says despite his family , his heart is in @entity4			1
when the @entity93 fell in 2001 he felt a strong desire to return to his country and rebuild the nation 's rich and vibrant musical culture			1
under the @entity93 it had virtually been wiped out with a nationwide ban			1
music was considered blasphemous , musicians were persecuted and if you were caught playing an instrument , the punishment for this " crime " was having one of your hands cut off			0
the @entity93 destroyed most instruments during their brutal five - year rule , often using the wood for heating			1
if the instruments were too big , like a piano , they would blow them up with a grenade so they could carry them out in pieces			0
a true believer in the healing power of music , @entity81 explained his vision for @entity19			1
" it was based on the strong belief of the power of music , as a powerful force , which can play a significant role in establishing a civil and just society in post-taliban @entity4			1
" it took years of planning , lobbying and gathering financial support but finally @entity81 had the beginnings of a national music school			1
after a $ 2 million donation from the @entity153 , @entity151 was suddenly overwhelmed by international interest and funding from foreign ministries , embassies and music schools from @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , the @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity42			0
@entity81 said many of the instruments were donated and described the storage rooms upstairs for these valuable pieces as " treasure troves			1
" he said they would be the " envy of many music schools around the world			0
" as part of the program , he has hired nine international music teachers from the @entity162 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity42 to not only teach the students but also train local @entity4 teachers			1
@entity180 arrived in @entity1 two and a half years ago from @entity181 , feeling compelled to act after the september 11 attacks shook the core of his country			1
he said he had no idea what sort of adventure he was about to embark upon but felt strongly about helping to mend and rebuild a war - ravaged @entity4			1
he is now the conductor of @entity19 's youth orchestra that has just been invited to perform in the @entity162 at @entity191 's @entity190 and @entity181 's @entity192 in february next year			0
" when the people of the world see there are @entity4 girls and boys performing side by side that means to a certain extent that we 've won , and that @entity4 has won , because music is a historical and inalienable part of @entity4 culture , and its return is tremendously exciting , " he said			2
@entity19 works very closely with @entity4 's @entity206 , which is very proud of what the school is achieving			1
@entity209 believes his greatest achievement is co-education within the school			2
boys and girls , side by side , in a country where in some towns , girls still do n't have access to an education			2
the @entity93 made it very clear during its rule that no girls were allowed to go to school -- a rule that is still applied in their heartland in southern @entity4			1
but at @entity19 young girls smile and laugh with their male classmates , oblivious to the divisions deep with their society			0
" this is a revolution for this country , " he explained			2
" these girls are serving as a mother for the entire nation			0
i 'm very pleased our institute is a mother for the country			2
" one girl who is passionate about education and her country is 10 - year - old @entity244			2
girls do n't have to wear headscarves inside the school grounds though @entity248 puts one on			2
but instead of wearing it traditionally over her head and wrapped around her shoulders , she ties it together behind her head , at the nape of her neck			0
with a mischievous grin she explained , " this is my style			0
" asked about the future of the country , this orphaned girl who was n't even born when the @entity93 fell from power , said emphatically , " the @entity93 is very bad			1
every person has the right to learn			0
every child , every human being should have the right to study music			0
nobody should interfere in their lives			0
" sitting next to her friend @entity271 on the piano stool , @entity248 smiled warmly at her as the two girls hit the keys in time , their little fingers creating the nostalgic sounds of a traditional @entity4 tune			2
when asked what she wants to do when she grows up and graduates from the school , she replied : " i want to build my country and make @entity4 a great place			1
if other people want to build our country i want to work beside them			0

@entity18 has been running for the past two and a half years
half the places at the school in @entity1 go to children who are street kids or orphans
@entity4 officials believe there are over 600,000 street children across the country
@entity81 returned to set up the school after fleeing the @entity93
