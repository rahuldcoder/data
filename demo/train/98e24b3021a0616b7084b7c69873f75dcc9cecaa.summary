-- having worked in government for more than two decades on the foreign policy side , one of my key takeaways is that the world is a cruel and unforgiving place			0
and with apologies to @entity11 , more often than not , @entity9 policy options are choices not among the good , bad and the ugly , but just between the last two			1
the deal to bring @entity14 home was one such tortuous choice			1
let 's be clear : this is a very bad , even ugly deal			1
the @entity9 undercut almost every principle we claim to adhere to on negotiating with terrorists ( in this case , the @entity22 , the militant group that was holding @entity14 , has plenty of @entity9 blood on its hands ) and let out some very bad guys who are almost certain to direct any number of enterprises to attack @entity9 and weaken the @entity9 efforts in @entity31			1
and the administration carried out the @entity14 deal with its characteristic lack of tactical dexterity and smarts , failing to brief key members of @entity38 appropriately and perhaps even violating @entity9 law			1
finally , for all its effort , given the strange and confusing facts surrounding @entity14 's own actions , the @entity41 administration is being severely criticized for what it has done			1
but notwithstanding all that , and however distasteful the deal , it was both a moral and necessary one			1
and here 's why : written or unwritten , traditional code or assumed values , in an @entity9 - initiated war there are @entity9 responsibilities and commitments to those who fight it			1
we did n't seek out the @entity31 campaign			0
it was a legitimate response to the 9/11 attacks , regardless of how badly managed and unattainable its objectives became over the past decade			0
and it matters not a whit that we have a volunteer military and that @entity14 willfully stepped up or that he may have turned against the war or perhaps even deserted his post			1
these are matters that may or may not be sorted out later			0
what counts are the responsibilities and obligations the @entity9 military and political establishment -- in this case , the commander in chief -- have to those whom they put in harm 's way			1
this relationship between the state and those it marshals and mobilizes to defend the country -- draft or volunteer military -- is a fundamental and contractual obligation			0
that tradition was established in our own @entity88 , in which the magnitude of the death and human misery fundamentally changed the relationship between the federal government and its citizenry			0
as the extraordinary @entity100 documentary " death and the @entity99 " makes clear , before 1861 , " there were no national cemeteries in @entity9			1
no provisions for identifying the dead , or for notifying next of kin , or for providing aid to the suffering families of dead veterans			0
no federal relief organizations , no effective ambulance corps , no adequate federal hospitals , no federal provisions for burying the dead			0
" that war created a new frame of reference for soldier , citizen , and the state : a new set of commitments and undertakings at the national level that have broadened and deepened to this day			0
that @entity14 may have violated his part of the contract is dismaying , even perverse , under the circumstances			1
but it is really not the point			0
he 's one of ours in a war we may not have sought but that our military fought ; we made his presence on the field of battle possible and we are responsible for getting him back			2
does that mean paying any price and sacrificing countless @entity9 lives in the process ? of course not			2
but it does mean undertaking a determined -- even relentless -- effort to look for opportunities and ways to accomplish it consistent with our interests and values			2
now for the price that was paid			0
the details of the urgency , timing and opportunity to trade for @entity14 are not at all clear			2
the state of his health , the accuracy of @entity159 warnings that his life was in danger , growing frustration on the part of his captors are all missing pieces			0
and we may never know them fully			0
the end results are clear though			0
did the @entity22 score a propaganda victory in this trade ? yes , they did			0
did the @entity9 weaken its own hand by showing that it will trade kidnapped @entity9 soldiers for @entity31 prisoners ? sure it did			1
is there a risk that those we released will conspire again to kill @entity9 ? you bet there is			2
but these are contingencies , possibilities in a world of uncertainties that must be measured against the certainty and reality of recovering an @entity9 life and redeeming a soldier after five years of captivity			2
we will never know whether , had the @entity9 not cut this deal , @entity14 would have been irreparably damaged or killed			1
under these circumstances , the decision to redeem @entity14 was not only compelling , it was a moral imperative			1
we are not the @entity192			0
we do not live in an environment of threat and insecurity , one in which our citizens serve in the military and that service is inextricably linked to our culture , values and perception of the world			2
we do not face existential threats			2
nor is our political establishment conditioned to accept asymmetrical trades with terrorists that can reach such proportions as the prisoner deal with @entity210 for kidnapped @entity192 soldier @entity211 , who was traded for 1,027 @entity213 prisoners			2
but we claim to be a moral nation with values and principles that coexist alongside our interests			1
indeed , many argue that our values are our interests			0
i can not think of many foreign policy actions in recent years in which the @entity9 acted principally for moral , ethical or humanitarian considerations			1
this is one of those rare occasions			0
and instead of beating ourselves up -- and the president , too -- for acting according to values that we purport to cherish , we need to face up to the fact that we had the conviction and courage to act in a way that was both moral and necessary , however messy the process and the price we may yet pay .			1

@entity234 : @entity9 deal to free @entity14 was ugly , but it was moral and necessary
he says when @entity9 sends *troops* into harm 's way , it 's responsible for them
@entity9 weakened its hand by making deal , he says , but it *reflected* nation 's values
@entity234 : we need to face that we had the conviction , courage to act , no matter how messy
