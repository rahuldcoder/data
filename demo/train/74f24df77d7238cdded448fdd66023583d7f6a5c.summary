-- a catholic priest , a rabbi , an evangelical minister , a @entity4 , a @entity7 @entity6 archbishop and two @entity9 leaders walk into the @entity10			2
it sounds like the beginning of a joke			0
but the @entity15 's decision to invite representatives from all of these faiths to speak at this week 's convention , but to exclude a @entity21 - @entity20 imam , is anything but funny			1
the @entity15 has a problem with @entity21			2
of course , @entity20 @entity21 can take some solace in the fact that we are not the only minority group that the @entity15 hardly welcomes			1
let 's be honest , if you do n't like @entity21 , blacks , gays , immigrants or other minorities , which political party would make you feel most comfortable ? sure , some @entity10 officials are minorities , but a recent @entity38 survey found that 89 % of the @entity15 is white			1
to be clear , i do n't believe that most rank - and - file members of the @entity15 hate @entity21			1
the problem is that certain @entity10 leaders have stoked the flames of hate toward @entity45 , and other minorities , as a political tool to motivate people to support their cause			1
for example , recently rep. @entity50 -- along with four other @entity15 @entity52 members -- asserted that the @entity54 had infiltrated the @entity20 government			2
@entity50 , who is in a tough re-election battle in her redrawn congressional district , even " named names " by claiming that secretary @entity60 's top aide , @entity61 , and rep. @entity62 were connected to the @entity54			0
although @entity10 sen. @entity63 publicly denounced @entity50 's baseless allegations , just a few weeks later , @entity15 rep. @entity15 escalated the fear - mongering			1
@entity66 , who is in a tight race with @entity69 opponent @entity68 , told constituents at a town hall meeting in the @entity73 suburbs that there are radical @entity21 living among them who are plotting to kill them : " one thing i 'm sure of is that there are people in this country -- there is a radical strain of @entity81 in this country -- it 's not just over there -- trying to kill @entity20 every week			2
" @entity66 even claimed that this @entity21 radical was in his district : " it 's in @entity87			0
" and let 's not forget that during this year 's @entity10 presidential primaries , @entity95 and @entity96 told voters that @entity20 @entity21 want to impose @entity81 law in @entity20			1
it 's a truly astounding task when you consider that this would require the 2.6 million @entity21 in the @entity20 to overpower the other 300 million @entity20 and implement an @entity81 legal system			2
obviously , this assertion is not based on facts , but to politicians desperate for votes , facts do n't matter			0
this type of rhetoric has yielded two distinct consequences			0
first , it can be seen in the attitudes of republicans who have been poisoned by the @entity116 voices in their party			0
a recent poll found that 62 % of @entity120 voters view @entity20 @entity21 favorably , but only 34 % of @entity122 voters shared that positive outlook			0
even more alarming is that fear - mongering by politicians can create an environment that inspires violence against the people being demonized			1
it sends a message that these people are " others " and not truly @entity20 like the rest of us			0
for example , within a few weeks of @entity50 's comments , a suspicious fire destroyed a mosque in @entity138			0
and days after @entity66 's warnings that @entity21 terrorists were living in the @entity73 suburbs , a homemade acid bomb was thrown at an @entity81 school , pellet gunshots were fired at a mosque , and @entity21 headstones at a cemetery were defaced with @entity116 graffiti , all in the @entity73 area			0
it 's impossible to know whether these hateful acts were related to the remarks , but the climate created by fear - mongering does not encourage tolerance			1
getting back to this week 's @entity10 : the @entity15 should be applauded for including so many faiths , especially the @entity4 , who number about 200,000 @entity20 and whose community was targeted by a hate - filled gunman who killed six people in a place of worship			1
but excluding @entity21 sends a message that @entity20 @entity21 are not part of the fabric of this country			0
@entity169 chairman @entity168 still has time to correct this mistake			1
he could invite a @entity21 - @entity20 imam to be a part of this week 's convention			1
that would send a clear message that the @entity15 is truly welcoming of all major religions practiced in the @entity20 it also would send a message that there is no place for hate in the @entity15 against any @entity20 minority group			2
it 's now up to @entity184 to show whether the @entity15 stands for inclusiveness or division			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 : leaders of many faiths to speak at @entity10 , except , *glaringly* , an imam
some @entity15 *spread* hate against @entity21 and immigrants for political gain , he says
@entity189 : this fear - mongering creates an environment that inspires violence
he says @entity10 chairman @entity168 should ask a @entity21 - @entity20 imam to speak
