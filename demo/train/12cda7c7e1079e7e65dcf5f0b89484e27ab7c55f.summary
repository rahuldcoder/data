-- @entity2 scientists have dated a star thought to be the oldest yet discovered , and it 's right in our neighborhood -- astronomically speaking			1
the star , which has been given the name @entity9 , is thought by a team of astronomers at the @entity12 to be 13.6 billion years old			1
the star itself is not a new discovery -- it is faintly visible on existing photographic maps of the southern sky			2
but the recent dating places it as older than any other celestial body previously found			1
the star is part of our @entity25 galaxy and only around 6,000 light years from @entity27 , relatively close in astronomical terms			0
@entity29 , a research fellow at @entity12 's @entity30 , published the findings in the scientific journal nature			0
" stars act as time capsules , " @entity29 told @entity0			0
" this one took a little sample of the universe at the time that is was formed ... and means we can study [ what the early universe was like ] in great detail			0
" the discovery of the star 's age -- which dates it at only a hundred million years younger than scientific estimates of the age of the universe itself -- is significantly older than any previously dated stars			1
the oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old			1
@entity29 and his team used the @entity54 telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky			0
the team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star , the greater the amounts of iron it had			1
the @entity54 telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron , which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars , a key indicator of iron levels			2
" the stars we are finding @entity80 , " said team member @entity76 on the @entity12 's website			2
the team looked at 60 million stars and narrowed down potential candidates to a shortlist of 200 , which were examined using the @entity86 telescope in @entity87			0
it is an important cosmological discovery , as it tells researchers a great deal about the origin of the elements that make up the universe			0
@entity29 said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in " extremely violent explosions , " and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found .			2

a 13.6 billion - year - old star has been dated by @entity2 astronomers
the discovery of star 's age makes it the oldest celestial body ever found
the team used a unique technique for dating stars , based on the amount of iron present
