, prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer			2
you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course			2
and an attack from the crabgrass			2
but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root - chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown			1
" if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit - or - miss way , it gets weak , " says this @entity18 landscape contractor @entity17			1
" and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem			0
" little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders			0
but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf			0
that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height ( ask your local garden center what 's best where you live ) ; and fertilizing in spring and fall			1
so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year			0
in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer			1
fungal disease symptoms : circular patches of yellow - to - brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads			1
culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread			1
these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf			0
solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate - methyl and follow the directions			1
for an organic fix , search out a corn - gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi			1
then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn - care habits : avoid excessive shade ( prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary ) and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides			1
carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening			1
weeds symptoms : fast - growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass			1
this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root			0
to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ; it should slide in easily			0
solutions : the first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders			0
the best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe			0
this will also loosen the soil in affected areas			1
or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot - treat an infestation			1
if weeds are too plentiful to be pulled , check your garden center for a " weed - and - feed " blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area , or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten			1
be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly , as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24 - hour breather with no foot traffic			1
from here on out , mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly , and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods			0
water well as the summer heats up , and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds			1
in the fall , open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard , or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn			0
you may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring			0
insects symptoms : @entity172 turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat. culprits : white grubs , a catch - all name for root - chomping beetle larvae , including june bugs , @entity181 beetles , and masked chafers			1
to be sure that 's what you 've got , cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back , looking for pale , half - inch - to inch - long c - shaped bugs			2
if you find more than six , treat the turf			0
this old house : meet the good bugs solutions : grubs are the biggest threat to lawns , and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective			2
for an organic fix , spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes - microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they 're present			2
with nematodes , timing the application with their life cycle is critical , so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly			0
both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online ( gardensalive.com )			0
symptoms : irregular - shaped patches of brownish - yellow grass			1
culprits : chinch bugs , gray - black , quarter - inch - long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack @entity222 and zoysia grasses in the @entity225 and @entity226 bluegrass in the @entity227			2
to spot them , bury an empty coffee can , with both ends removed , at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water			1
the bugs will seek out the moisture , then float to the top			0
if you see more than 10 after 20 minutes , you should address the problem			0
solutions : chinch bugs live on the surface , among thatch , so dethatching will reduce their numbers			0
to eradicate them completely , look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient			0
longer - term , overseed with chinch - bug - resistant grasses			1
symptoms : patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base			2
culprits : sod webworms and tropical sod webworms , hairless cream - to - gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small , buff - colored moths at maturity			2
the tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm			0
to check for webworms , mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water ; pour it over the infested turf			1
any larvae will float to the top			0
solutions : you can try flooding your lawn to drown them			0
or choose an appropriate insecticide ; in an organic product , look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad			0
with extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix. @entity284 : if dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn , keep a hose or water bucket nearby			2
dog urine is high in nitrogen , which can " burn " turf , creating a good - sized yellow patch			1
the best fix is immediate action : flush the area asap with water to dilute it			1
once badly burned , grass wo n't come back on its own - you 'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed			2

a good corn - gluten mix cures brown patches and weakens most fungi
@entity172 patches are often indicative of bug problems
dog urine is high is nitrogen , so flush affected areas with water
