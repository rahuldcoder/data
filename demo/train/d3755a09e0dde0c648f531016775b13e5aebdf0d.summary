with his country grappling with the damage from " hell - storm " @entity4 , a @entity1 official launched a hunger strike tuesday to pressure a @entity8 climate change conference for concrete steps to fight global warming			1
@entity11 , a member of the @entity12 , said he was fasting " in solidarity with my countrymen who are now struggling for food back home " -- including his own brother , whom @entity11 said " has been gathering bodies of the dead with his own two hands			1
" " what my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness			2
the climate crisis is madness , " he said			2
" mr. president , we can stop this madness , right here in @entity32			0
" @entity11 leads the @entity1 delegation to the 19th @entity34 in @entity36 's capital			1
he got a standing ovation after he spoke , four days after @entity4 struck his island nation with estimated winds of 315 kph ( 195 mph )			0
the storm has left nearly 1,800 people at the latest count			0
" despite the massive efforts that my country had exerted in preparing for the onslaught of this storm , it was just a force too powerful , and even as a nation familiar with storms , @entity4 was nothing we have ever experienced before , " @entity11 said			1
but he said the @entity1 refuses to accept that " running away from storms , evacuating our families , suffering the devastation and misery , counting our dead , ( will ) become a way of life			1
" @entity11 said he will refrain from eating during the 12 - day conference " until a meaningful outcome is in sight			1
" he called for " concrete pledges " to the @entity64 -- a @entity8 fund aimed at helping developing nations reduce their climate change emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change -- and said he will continue to fast " until we see real ambition on climate action in accordance with the principles of the convention			1
" he told @entity76 's @entity77 that while the complete picture of climate change is still being studied , the highest increase in measured sea levels over the past seven decades " has been in the waters just east of the @entity1			1
" " the precautionary principle tells you you should n't wait for full scientific certainty before doing something or taking action , " he said			2
" how many lives do we want to lose , not just in the @entity1 but in communities that have other climate impacts ? " read more : projected @entity4 death toll falls , but tensions rise the idea of long - term climate change driven largely by the use of fossil fuels , which release heat - trapping carbon emissions into the atmosphere , is controversial politically but accepted as fact by most researchers			1
scientists say they ca n't pin any particular storm on the process , but that the warming of the air and oceans " loads the dice " in favor of more extreme weather			2
" when it 's a very rare event , we have a challenge scientifically in distinguishing between the rare chance event and the possible effects of global warming			0
so for these individual storms , that 's a particular challenge , " said @entity116 , a climate scientist at @entity118 in @entity119			1
but @entity116 added , " even though that 's challenging science , we do know that global warming is occurring , we do know that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of that global warming , and we do know that a number of extreme events have increased in likelihood as a result of that			0
" @entity134 , a climate and statistics expert at @entity137 , said that does n't necessarily mean more hurricanes or typhoons			2
" we could see fewer storms , but the ones that do form could be stronger , " @entity134 said			0
that appears to be the trend over the past 30 years , he said			0
an october study in the scientific journal @entity147 noted that more than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050 , and the countries that will first see its effects are the ones least capable of responding			0
and a june report by the @entity155 noted that the @entity1 is already seeing the effects of a warming climate , ranking 16 of its provinces among the most vulnerable regions in southeast @entity160			1
watch the opening session of the 19th cop the @entity1 has launched efforts to better prepare for the impact of climate change , president @entity163 told @entity76 's @entity167 on tuesday			1
but he said addressing the issue is a global problem			0
" we all live on one planet , " @entity163 said			0
" either we come up with a solution that everybody adheres to and cooperates with , or let us be prepared to meet disasters			0
" on the table in @entity32 is the issue of compensating countries that suffer from the effects of climate change and ca n't afford to adapt on their own			0
" the poorest people of the world are at greater risk because of our vulnerability and decades of maldevelopment , which i also must assert is connected to the kind of pursuit of economic growth that has led to an altered climate system , " @entity11 said			1
in his remarks to the conference , @entity11 challenged climate change skeptics to " get off their ivory towers and away from the comfort of their armchairs " to see the communities battling flooding , hurricanes and fires			1
" and if that is not enough , they may want to see what has happened to @entity1 now , " he said			1
this year 's @entity32 conference brings together countries that have signed onto the @entity206			0
the annual meetings review the parties ' progress in limiting global temperature increases			0
@entity11 said that at the last conference , held in @entity212 less than a year ago , he appealed to the world to open its eyes as the @entity1 had confronted another catastrophic storm -- @entity216 , then the costliest in its history			1

with an apparent cruel twist of fate , my country is being tested by this hell - storm called @entity4 , " he said			0
he said he spoke on behalf of his delegation as well as " the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm			0
" @entity11 's protest prompted @entity232 users to begin using the hashtag # fastfortheclimate in support			2
the @entity235 -- a body of 850 nongovernmental organizations -- later announced that members of " civil society " were joining @entity11 in fasting , in a move it said is " unprecedented within the history of the climate movement			1
" @entity235 spokeswoman @entity245 said the protest is spreading " far and wide , " with at least 100 people in @entity32 for the conference also fasting			0
" a lot of climate - focused youth groups have jumped on it immediately to show solidarity , " she said			2
@entity245 said the hunger strikers want the @entity32 conference to take " concrete steps " toward reducing carbon emissions before 2020 , enacting an international mechanism for damages and financing efforts to adapt to a warming world .			2
