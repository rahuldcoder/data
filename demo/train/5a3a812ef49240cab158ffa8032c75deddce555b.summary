@entity0 , @entity1 -- for decades , @entity3 has advocated for the rights of @entity5 who , like him , are living with a disability			1
but the attorney from @entity9 saw his life shift in 1997 , when he was invited to speak in @entity1			1
" i was asked to bring one wheelchair to give to somebody , " he remembers			0
" as i was waiting for the program to begin , i was shocked to see people using branches for crutches , being pushed in wheelbarrows and crawling			2
" the lone wheelchair went to @entity19 , a 17 - year - old suffering from polio			2
she had never walked a day in her life , and she was carried around daily by her mother			2
" i saw how happy she was , but i looked around and saw the other people that had nothing , " @entity24 said			2
" their life was going to be exactly the same , and one wheelchair was not enough			2
i just felt someone had to come and help			0
" so once a year from 1997 until 2004 , @entity24 would load a van with 10 to 15 donated wheelchairs and drive 30 hours -- from @entity9 to @entity1 -- to distribute them to people with disabilities			1
now , he has a permanent residence in the country and a nonprofit , @entity40 , that provides custom - fit wheelchairs , walkers and canes to people in rural @entity1 communities			1
" we want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the @entity5 every year , " said @entity24 , 56			1
" what we call our trash becomes their riches , and it makes an incredible difference in their lives			0
" the used wheelchairs are collected from hospitals , nursing homes , medical supply businesses and individual donors from across the @entity5			1
with help from a @entity5 - based nonprofit , @entity63 , the wheelchairs are refurbished by senior citizen volunteers and prison inmates in @entity66 before being shipped to @entity1			1
st. @entity3 ' group also began purchasing mobility equipment from a company in @entity1 that makes wheelchairs designed for use on the country 's rough terrain			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity77 @entity24 said the wheelchairs provide recipients with more independence , access to job opportunities and the chance to pursue a social life			1
" before it , i did n't know anyone ; i was in the house , " said @entity88 , who is now 32			0
" after i got my chair , it was like i was born again			0
i went out , and i got to know other people with disabilities when i 'd thought i was the only one			2
i also started working , and i have my own house now			0
i 'm married , and my 2 - year - old girl thinks of @entity3 like a grandfather			1
i really am thankful for all of his support			0
" the mission of @entity40 goes beyond a one - time gift			2
" we do n't just give them a wheelchair and say , ' adios , ' " @entity24 said			0
" we develop relationships , and we teach people how to use the chair -- not just as something to sit in			2
volunteers from the @entity5 come down a few times a year to help make the recipients ' homes more wheelchair - accessible , and we host classes and camps to teach people how to play sports with their chairs			1
" @entity24 has become a familiar face throughout @entity1 , where an estimated 2 million people have some form of disability , according to a government housing census			1
he is frequently welcomed into homes and greeted kindly wherever he goes , and he has formed relationships with other organizations that serve people with disabilities			2
he believes his project 's popularity is due , in great part , to a personal connection to the people he serves			2
" i understand what they 're going through , and they know i understand , " @entity24 said			0
" we 're conquerors of the limitations in our life			2
" in 1976 , @entity24 fell while skiing in @entity140 , @entity141			0
the result was a severed spinal cord , a surgery - filled hospital stay and the rest of his life in a wheelchair			1
" i thought ( it ) was a horrible tragedy , " said @entity24 , who was an airplane mechanic in the @entity150 at the time			0
" i woke up every morning wishing i was dead ... angry at @entity153 for taking the ability to walk away from me			0
... i just stopped wanting anything for my life			0
" @entity24 rejected most forms of assistance from anyone			0
but with time -- and inspiration from a wheelchair - bound veteran he befriended -- he eventually " adjusted " and found a new purpose			0
@entity24 said he is now content and comfortable in @entity1 , where he lives and works for 10 months out of the year			1
but he acknowledges that he has received some criticism from friends and family in the @entity5			1
" people say , ' it 's too dangerous in @entity1 ; why do you go there to help when you can help people in the @entity5 ? ' " he said			1
" i feel like @entity153 has called me to do this			0
they need a presence here , and what i 'm doing is teaching other people so that when the day comes when i ca n't come to @entity1 anymore , the people of @entity1 will continue doing this work			1
that would be the biggest dream that i could ever imagine			0
" through @entity40 , @entity24 has helped more than 500 people in @entity1			1
he has also made lifelong friendships and learned that personal losses can be used to transform the lives of others			0
" one day , someone said , ' @entity3 , i want to thank you for giving up your legs so we could have a better quality of life , ' " @entity24 said			1
" i did n't intentionally give up my legs , but i feel like i gave up something to help other people			0
i know people 's lives are getting better in @entity1			1
i feel really great to be part of that			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity40 website at @entity199 and see how to help .			0
