@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's embattled government allowed about 200 activists and intellectuals , including some it had previously jailed , to hold a conference on democratic reform monday at a @entity0 hotel			1
" we must change this tyrannical regime to a democratic , civilian one , " @entity10 , a writer and one - time political prisoner , said			1
" how that transition happens is a question this conference is trying to address			0
" @entity10 said the conference would " not necessarily " find an answer to that question , " but that is the big question in this country now			0
" about 200 @entity1 dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom , including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition			1
but some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as president @entity31 tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests say the people in the hotel do n't necessarily speak for them			1
" the big question regarding this conference is , where are the young people ? " asked @entity36 , a pro-democracy activist based outside @entity1			1
" where are the people who are on the streets ? where are the voices of the people who are from @entity47 , or from @entity48 , or from @entity49 , or from @entity50 ? i think those are the voices that have been missed so far			0
" @entity36 is executive director of the @entity55 - based human rights group @entity54 , which says more than 630 people have been killed and 8,000 jailed in the clampdown			2
other human rights activists have put the death toll at more than 1,100			2
for its part , a @entity1 military spokesman said sunday that more than 400 police officers and government troops and police have been killed battling " armed gangs			1
" @entity2 can not independently verify either claim			0
but @entity68 , one of the activists who gathered in @entity0 , said , " i think it 's time for us to say our political statement			1
" there is the statement coming from the street , there is the statement coming from the authorities and there is the statement coming from everywhere outside the country , " he said			2
" it 's time for this group to say what they think and find solutions			0
" and @entity10 said the street protests are needed to " put pressure on the state to stop its dominance over society			1
" if that does n't happen , he said , " then we are definitely at risk of going back to jail -- and for a very long time			2
" in @entity97 , @entity96 spokesman @entity95 said monday 's conference was " a worthwhile step , " but told reporters that " the violence has to stop			1
" " for it to be truly significant , it has to be part of a cessation of violence against the @entity1 people			1
it has to be part of an embrace of the idea that they need to have a national dialogue about their future , and that that transition needs to take place with the regime leading it or getting out of the way			0
" the @entity120 has ruled @entity1 since 1971 , with @entity31 taking power after his father 's death in 2000			2
he held out a promise of reforms and a " national dialogue " in a speech last week that was met with widespread skepticism			0
@entity10 said he expected the government to try to exploit monday 's conference and hold out those who attended as " the reasonable ones			0
" but he added , " we will always try to defend the street , because it is also a reasonable , right and peaceful street that always protests peacefully			0
" @entity2 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
