-- @entity1 , the nation 's most visible gun - rights advocate , rallied supporters on saturday for a renewed fight against gun control , saying membership is up since the @entity9 massacre , and calling the effort to stop new limits a " long war " and a " fight for everything we care about			1
" the @entity17 's executive vice president vowed in remarks at the group 's national convention that " we will never surrender our guns			1
" he implored members to step up their outreach to members of @entity25 as part of a fight against " elites " and others who " use tragedy to try to blame us , to shame us " into compromise and who " want to change @entity34 , our culture and our values			0
" @entity1 delivered a speech heavy on militaristic and sweeping patriotic rhetoric			0
it was a signature moment at the weekend event , which sought to embrace a culture war theme in its so - far successful fight in @entity44 against recent gun - control initiatives			0
@entity1 singled out president @entity46 , who has pushed for new firearms restrictions following the december 2012 massacre at @entity9 in @entity9 , @entity49 , which left 20 children and six adults dead			1
the killings jolted the nation and energized gun - control advocates , while putting pressure on @entity1 's group and testing its political muscle anew			2
polls have shown most americans favoring some kind of new restrictions			0
@entity1 said @entity17 membership has spiked , reaching a record 5 million , and he implored members to counter efforts by leading gun - control advocates , like @entity67 mayor @entity66 , @entity46 , and @entity68 in @entity25			1
" we are in the midst of a once - in - a - generation fight for everything we care about			0
we have a chance to secure our freedom for a generation , or to lose it forever , " @entity1 said			0
" we must remain vigilant , ever resolute , and steadfastly growing and preparing for the even more critical battles that loom before us , " he said			0
@entity1 disparaged what he called @entity46 's " all - out siege against our rights " and efforts in @entity25 to enact new gun control measures , calling it " political posturing			1
" " mr. president , you can give all the speeches you want			0
you can conjure up all the polls you can and call @entity17 members all the nasty names you can think of , but your gun control legislation wo n't stop one criminal , would n't make anyone safer anywhere , " @entity1 said			2
" and that flawed failure lost on its merits and got the defeat it deserved , " he said , referring to the setback sustained by gun control advocates last month when a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks failed in the @entity98			2
the outcome was considered a victory for gun rights advocates , who lobbied hard to block its passage			0
@entity46 has vowed to keep pursuing new restrictions , and a co-author of the ill - fated legislative amendment is working to revive it			1
@entity1 and the @entity17 propose , instead , that current laws be enforced , that schools include armed guards , that the government rebuild a " broken mental health system , " and " for @entity119 's sake , leave the rest of us alone ! " @entity1 said the failed compromise background check proposal by sens. @entity122 , a @entity124 @entity123 , and @entity125 , a @entity127 @entity126 , were ineffective			1
" the @entity122 - @entity125 bill you later backed would n't have prevented @entity9 , would n't have prevented @entity133 or @entity134 , " he said of other deadly mass shootings in @entity129 in 2011 and @entity130 last july , " and wo n't prevent the next tragedy , " " none of it , any of it have anything to do with keeping our children safe at school anywhere , " he said			2
@entity1 also struck out specifically at @entity145 , who has poured funds into the group @entity148 , for acting as a " national nanny " and criticized the media for , as he said , failing to hold @entity46 accountable			2
incoming @entity17 president @entity151 is setting his sights on congressional midterm elections in 2014 as crucial in the gun rights debate , urging members to support @entity157 and @entity98 members who have voted against recent efforts to instate a background check system .			1
