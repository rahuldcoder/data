in an interview with @entity0 's " newsroom , " @entity11 said her daughter is " not taking anything for granted			2
" but a priest who was visiting @entity17 reported the results were met with " jumping and hugging " on wednesday			1
" there are many people that support her , " @entity11 said			0
" he said he could finally see the light back in her eyes , and she looked like she could finally breathe after three and a half years			2
" @entity17 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity27 , were found guilty in the 2007 killing of @entity17 's roommate , @entity28			1
@entity30 was found dead in the villa she rented with @entity17 in the central @entity33 university town of @entity34 , semi-naked and with her throat slashed			1
in december , @entity17 was sentenced to 26 years in prison			1
but wednesday , forensic experts told an @entity33 court that the dna evidence police used to link @entity17 to the murder weapon may have been tainted			1
the next hearing in her appeal is scheduled for july 25 , with further hearings on july 30 and august 1			0
@entity11 said a decision on the appeal could come in late september			0
she said her daughter was " a naive , idealistic , easygoing 20 - year - old " when she was arrested , but has " gone into her own little shell " while in jail			0
" she 's definitely grown up , " @entity11 said			2
" she 's had to learn how to survive and take care of herself			2
she has become much more closed in that environment in order to kind of survive			0
" at the trial , prosecutors said a knife found in @entity27 's home had traces of @entity17 's genetic material on the handle and @entity30 's in a tiny groove on the blade			1
investigators also traced dna on @entity30 's bra to @entity27			2
but in a 146 - page report , forensic science professors @entity66 and @entity68 concluded that while @entity17 's dna was present on the knife handle , tests for @entity30 's dna were unreliable			1
" there is no conclusive scientific evidence regarding the nature of the blood , " the their report states			2
it added , " it can not be excluded that the result obtained from sampling the find b ( knife blade ) could be the result of contamination " occurring at any stage of the testing process			0
investigators did not follow " international inspection procedures and protocols for gathering and presenting evidence " in testing either the knife or the bra fastening , " they found			0
prosecutors say the knife had been used to stab @entity30 in the neck and that it had been cleaned			0
the dna matter attributed to @entity30 consists of flesh , not blood , they say			0
but the sample was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity30 's slaying were unable to double - test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity17 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
defense lawyers also say the tiny metal clasp from @entity30 's bra , which was cut from her body after her murder , may have been contaminated because it was not collected as evidence until nearly six weeks later			1
in an appeal hearing monday , @entity17 took to the stand herself following testimony from a third person convicted in the case , @entity28			1
it was the first time the three defendants had appeared in court together since a preliminary hearing years ago			0
@entity121 , who was found guilty of murder in a separate fast - track trial and sentenced to 16 years , refused to say @entity17 was not involved in the killing			1
a prosecutor then read out a letter sent by @entity121 in 2010 in which he said he thought the @entity5 and her then - boyfriend had killed @entity30			0
