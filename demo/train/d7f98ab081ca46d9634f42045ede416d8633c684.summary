-- a military judge dismissed the jury monday in @entity3			1
gen. @entity6 's court - martial after e-mails emerged over the weekend that could point to alleged @entity9 interference in the proceedings			1
among the 22 pages of e-mails are a january communication in which a senior military lawyer writes @entity16 's chief of military justice casting doubt on @entity6 's accuser 's credibility , and a february correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the @entity23 asked for a colonel 's " thoughts / opinion " on @entity6 's offer to enter a plea			1
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity31 , col. @entity29 , the presiding judge in the court - martial , granted a motion to reconsider whether unlawful command influence has marred the proceedings			0
the judge ruled @entity37 prosecutors failed to meet their burden of proof in denying that the court - martial had been unduly influenced			2
now , according to @entity31 , the court must determine whether to grant a mistrial or delay the current trial and start over			0
the judge ruled out his third option : dropping the most serious charges against @entity6 , said @entity47 , a spokesman for the defense			2
last week , @entity6 , formerly one of the top @entity37 commanders in @entity50 , pleaded guilty to several charges , including committing adultery , engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women , conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and obstruction of justice , reported the public affairs office for @entity16 in @entity59			1
the government 's lawyers dropped two counts -- one of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman , and the other for cruelty and maltreatment -- while @entity6 still stands accused of " sodomy ... by force and without the consent " of his alleged victim , an @entity37 captain			1
charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government , according to @entity16			0
the accuser , whom the defense has painted as a jilted lover upset that @entity6 would n't leave his wife , testified the day after @entity6 entered pleas to some charges , with the accuser telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex , @entity31 reported			2
she was slated to continue testifying monday , but the judge put the case on hold			0
it 's unclear if she will resume testimony tuesday			0
the e-mails that brought the proceedings to a halt monday were described by defense attorney @entity99 as evidence showing that not only did senior @entity37 officials believe that the accuser had a credibility issue , but also that commanders are making decision based on politics rather than justice			1
in the january communication , col. @entity108 , a staff judge advocate , writes lt. gen. @entity110 about the accuser 's testimony regarding an @entity113 she said she found december 9			1
" the forensic analysis of the phone indicates she accessed the phone before 9 december , which brings her credibility into question			0
the @entity121 ( @entity122 ) is trying to reconcile the forensic analysis and her statement , but it is possible that she was not truthful , " @entity120 wrote			0
the defense wants the remaining charges against @entity6 dismissed and says the case " should never have come to trial			2
" " it 's a mess entirely of the government 's making , " @entity99 said			1
" when the chief prosecutor quits because he does n't believe the accuser , when senior officials in the chain of command and the @entity9 agree that the accuser has a credibility problem , and when commanders make decisions based on politics instead of justice , how can you possibly call this a functional process ?
