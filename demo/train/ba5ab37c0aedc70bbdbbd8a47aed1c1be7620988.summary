-- the world - famous @entity1 is owned by the @entity4 government and operated cooperatively by @entity5 and an institute under contract to @entity5			1
now that the government has shut down , the institute can still use existing resources to continue @entity1 operations for as long as possible			2
its staff has tried to ensure that -- to the extent possible -- the shutdown will not affect telescope operations			2
but events can overtake plans			0
if @entity1 encounters a problem or a glitch , as happens occasionally , science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations			1
safe mode means orienting the delicate instruments away from the sun while keeping the solar panels illuminated , to make sure no instrument loses power and is ruined			2
but in safe mode , the instruments wo n't record any of the light coming to the telescope			2
the approximate cost of one hour of @entity1 observing is somewhere between $ 8,000 and $ 25,000 , depending on whether one adds the costs of operating and refurbishing the facility to its initial construction costs			2
that means a two - week government shutdown could waste $ 3 million , $ 5 million , even $ 8 million of taxpayer investment			1
frankly , the loss to science is far greater			1
each year thousands of astronomers from around the world compete to decide where @entity1 will point -- toward particular stars or planets or galaxies or gravitational lenses			0
special science panels spend weeks setting priorities for the most important proposed science investigations			2
for every 10 hours of observing time astronomers want to use , only 1 hour is eventually approved			0
@entity4 shutdown threatens launch of @entity5 's next mission to @entity59 that means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations			1
the @entity63 , @entity1 's successor , is undergoing critical tests at the @entity66			2
this has to be done at extremely cold temperatures , mimicking conditions in space , and the amount of time to cool the system down is one of the drivers of schedule and therefore cost			0
as long as the government remains shut down , the testing will have to wait			0
if the shutdown lasts more than a few weeks , the @entity63 instrument module will have to be warmed up , probably pushing the launch date forward by a few months and raising the cost commensurately ( about $ 1 million per day )			1
@entity5 operates dozens of scientific spacecraft			1
a few look out at the cosmos , like @entity1			0
many monitor the sun and the particle environment around @entity89			0
such observations have provided early warning of major sunstorms ( known by solar scientists as " coronal mass ejections " ) that can knock out communications satellites and other fragile electronics			0
to check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown , this author tried to access a @entity5 website , only to see the following message : " due to the lapse in federal government funding , this website is not available			1
we sincerely regret the inconvenience			0
" this prompted further searching			0
the main @entity5 website defaults to the same error message			1
the education and outreach pages maintained by astronomers at the @entity66 -- and read by schoolchildren across the country -- are not accessible			0
the @entity117 , because it is run under contract to @entity5 , still has a visible website			1
their flagship mission , the @entity120 and its @entity122 , is apparently still active , operated by team members who work for @entity117 or @entity124 or other participating institutions other than the federal government			1
but as for @entity1 , if there is any kind of glitch , federal civil servants will be essential to the recovery of rover operations			0
@entity5 grounded by government shutdown the work does n't disappear , either			1
scientists at @entity5 and the @entity136 are some of the hardest working people i know			1
the government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work			1
they ca n't take their laptops home or phone into teleconferences from home , the way i might if a hurricane or snowstorm threatened @entity150			1
so , you might think they are having a nice ( though unpaid ) vacation			0
but actually , the same work is sitting on their desk when they get back , and it all has to get done			0
so it means they 'll work longer hours to catch up and for most civil servant scientists , there is no such thing as overtime pay			1
a @entity5 colleague at the @entity66 is designing a powerful new telescope			1
for the past few weeks , we 've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do			0
now , there is radio silence			0
his last e-mail said , " this is going to be my last e-mail before the government shutdown ends			1
any work during a shutdown is deemed a violation of the @entity181			2
you are welcome to continue to e-mail me , but i might not be able to respond until the federal government opens for business			0
" we are all waiting			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2

government shutdown affects @entity5 , where employees are off the job
@entity188 : a two - week shutdown could waste $ 3 million to $ 8 million of taxpayer money
she says loss to science is greater as critical astronomical work could be affected
@entity188 : @entity5 scientists ca n't do their work and must make up for it when shutdown ends
