-- for 17 years , @entity2 rovers have laid down tire tracks on @entity4			2
but details the space agency divulged this week about its next @entity4 exploration vehicle underscored @entity2 's ultimate goal			2
footprints are to follow someday			0
the last three rovers -- spirit , opportunity and @entity13 -- confirmed the @entity4 's ability to support life and searched for signs of past life			1
the @entity4 rover of the next decade will hone in on ways to sustain future life there , human life			1
" the 2020 rover will help answer questions about the @entity4 environment that astronauts will face and test technologies they need before landing on , exploring and returning from the @entity4 , " said @entity2 's @entity28 who works on human missions			1
this will include experiments that convert carbon dioxide in the @entity4 atmosphere into oxygen " for human respiration			0
" oxygen could also be used on @entity4 in making rocket fuel that would allow astronauts to refill their tanks			0
@entity41 rovers the 2020 rover is the near spitting image of @entity13 and @entity2 's @entity43 announced plans to launch the new edition not long after @entity13 landed on @entity4 in 2012			1
but the 2020 rover has new and improved features			1
the @entity47 , or moxie for short , is just one			0
there are super cameras that will send back 3d panoramic images and spectrometers that will analyze the chemical makeup of minerals with an apparent eye to farming			1
" an ability to live off the @entity4 land would transform future exploration of the planet , " @entity2 said in a statement			2
the 2020 rover will also create a job for a future mission to complete , once the technology emerges to return to @entity65 from @entity4			1
it will collect soil samples to be sent back for lab analysis at @entity2			1
@entity4 since 1964 in the 1960s , the public focus on @entity2 centered on missions to the moon			2
@entity71 , who took his " one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind " 45 years ago , was the first human to set foot on a celestial body			0
but by then , the space agency had already sent a satellite to @entity4 -- the first in 1964			0
in 1976 , the first two landers , @entity82 and 2 , touched down on its surface			0
the first rover , @entity84 , began rolling around 20 years later			0
in 2016 , @entity2 plans to send a new stationary lander , @entity86 , to @entity4 to drop a probe into the ground and research the planet 's core			2
it 's currently undergoing testing			0
the future mission to bring back soil samples collected by the @entity4 2020 rover is to be robotic			1
it 's not clear when @entity96 can look forward to the next small step for a human that 's a giant leap for humankind .			0

the @entity4 2020 rover looks a lot like the @entity13 rover
it has better and new exploration technology
cameras will see in stereo and spectrometers will analyze soil for *organic* material
it will collect soil samples for future missions to send back
