-- middle - eastern investment is continuing apace in the @entity3 despite the tough economic climate , with @entity6 - based @entity5 completing his long - awaited takeover of @entity8			1
@entity5 has continued his interest in @entity11 football with a buyout of @entity8			1
@entity5 , a board member of the @entity13 which bought out @entity14 a year ago , has been named chairman of the cash - strapped club after passing the @entity3 's " fit and proper " ownership test			1
he replaces @entity19 , who became co-owner of the south - coast club in january 2006 and took over full control six months later			2
@entity19 initially invested a lot of money in @entity8 , but with the economic downturn taking its toll , he announced last december he could no longer devote enough time to the club			1
@entity5 , who spearheaded the @entity14 takeover before @entity29 emerged as the main backer , struck a deal with @entity19 in late may before undergoing legal and financial due diligence			1
the subsequent uncertainty at @entity34 saw full - back @entity35 join @entity37 in a $ 28 million deal , while @entity40 team - mate @entity39 has been allowed to talk to other clubs after voicing his unhappiness			1
" this appointment brings stability to the club and is excellent news for @entity8 supporters , " chief executive @entity43 , who will retain his position , told @entity8 's official web site on tuesday			2
" i have every reason to believe that together with the new chairman we will be able to take the club forward to further achievements , building on the successes of the past three years			0
" @entity8 won the prestigious @entity56 two years ago and qualified for the @entity57 , but the club 's momentum was derailed when manager @entity60 left to take over at @entity3 rivals @entity61 then his replacement @entity63 was sacked after a poor run of results			2
@entity66 was brought in as caretaker manager in february and saved @entity8 from relegation -- and @entity5 made his first job as chairman to reward the former @entity72 boss with a two - year contract			1
" @entity66 did a great job keeping the team in the @entity3 last season , and having previously worked as director of youth operations he knows the club inside out , " @entity5 said			1
" he has immense experience and a great knowledge of the game , and commands the respect of the players			0
i 'm looking forward to working with him			0
" born in 1977 , @entity5 started his own business at the age of 18 and moved to the @entity87 after his parents and brother died in a road accident when he was 21			2
a keen chess player , he is chairman of the @entity92 , while he is the host of business - themed reality television show @entity94			0
@entity96 has sports sponsorship interests in @entity6 , @entity98 and @entity100 's @entity99			0
meanwhile , @entity102 manager @entity101 has given up on signing @entity39 following talks with the 28 - year - old			1
the @entity102 had agreed a fee for the gangly former @entity37 frontman , but he now appears set to return to his native @entity107 with either @entity108 or @entity61			0
" naturally this is hugely disappointing for us as @entity39 was one of our primary targets , " @entity101 told his club 's official web site			0
" i know he was impressed with the set up here when he came for talks , but it 's simply a matter of geographical location and that 's not something we can affect			0
" what 's pleasing however is that it shows the intent of the club going forward that we are trying to bring in players of his caliber , and we will continue to pursue other targets			0
" we have a number of irons in the fire at present and we will be looking to make several additions to our squad in the coming weeks			0
