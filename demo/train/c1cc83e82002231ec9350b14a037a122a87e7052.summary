government spokesman @entity23 told @entity0 said @entity17 's forces " are near victory			1
" but @entity26 , a spokesman for @entity14 , said " all government claims of victory are fabricated , and our forces are still on the ground			1

a nearby resident said the fighting had subsided after midnight , however			2

the intensity of the fighting in the capital , where most of @entity5 's security forces and army units are based , has increased fears that the country is on the verge of civil war			1

" the special forces of the @entity114 , the elite units , got involved on wednesday			0
they 're being used because the government wants to minimize collateral damage and the special forces have particular training in clearing fighters from buildings			0
