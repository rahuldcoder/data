@entity0 -- two @entity5 residents are suing @entity6 , alleging the company waters down @entity8 and other beers " significantly " to boost profits , their attorneys announced tuesday			1
the class - action lawsuit alleges that the maker of the " @entity14 " has the technology to precisely control the amount of alcohol in its beers but adds water so the alcohol is well below the advertised figure of 5 % by volume , the suit said			2
" there are no impediments -- economic , practical or legal -- to @entity6 accurately labeling its products to reflect their true alcohol content , " the 18 - page lawsuit said			1
" nevertheless , @entity6 uniformly misrepresents and overstates that content			0
" the beer maker rejected the lawsuit 's allegations			1
" the claims against @entity6 are completely false , and these lawsuits are groundless , " said @entity33 , vice president of brewing and supply for @entity6			1
" our beers are in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws			0
" we proudly adhere to the highest standards in brewing our beers , which have made them the best - selling in the @entity43 and the world , " he said			0
the lawsuit alleges the other watered - down beers are @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
but the suit does n't provide figures for the allegedly watered - down alcohol content			1
@entity59 and @entity60 , who reside in @entity61 , @entity5 , are the plaintiffs who say they stopped buying @entity8 after learning of the alleged mislabeling , the suit said			0
their suit , filed last week in federal court in @entity68 , alleges violations of @entity5 's consumer protection laws and @entity72 's @entity71			2
" i think it 's wrong for huge corporations to lie to their loyal customers -- i really feel cheated , " @entity59 said in a statement			0
" no matter what the product is , people should be able to rely on the information companies put on their labels			0
" the company 's parent , @entity86 , is the world 's largest producer of alcoholic beverages and made more than 10 billion gallons of malt libations in 2011 , generating gross profits of more than $ 22 billion , the lawsuit said			1
the parent company 's 13 @entity43 breweries alone produced more than 3 billion gallons of alcoholic beverages in 2011 , and @entity6 has a 47.7 % market share of the @entity43 sale of beer , the suit said			1
" because water is cheaper than alcohol , @entity6 adds extra water to its finished products to produce malt beverages that consistently have lower alcohol content than the percentage displayed on its labels , " the suit said			1
" by doing so , @entity6 is able to produce a significantly higher number of units of beer from the same starting batch of ingredients			0
" @entity6 never intends for the malt beverage to possess the amount of alcohol that is stated on the label			2
as a result , @entity6 's customers are overcharged for watered - down beer and @entity6 is unjustly enriched by the additional volume it can sell , " the suit said			2
the lawsuit , which says the matter in controversy exceeds $ 5 million , seeks unspecified amounts for compensatory and exemplary damages and asks the court to require the beer makers " to fund a corrective advertising campaign , " the suit said			0
in the aftermath of the lawsuit 's announcement , @entity129 and @entity1 affiliate @entity130 conducted independent lab tests this week on samples of some @entity86 beers and found their alcohol content matched the amount stated on the label			1
@entity6 gets more time to rework @entity141 deal			0

new : two media *outlets* ' lab tests find alcohol content of beer samples is as advertised
