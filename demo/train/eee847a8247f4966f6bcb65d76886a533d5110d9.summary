in the spring of 2000 , my friend @entity0 and i hopped on a bus in @entity4 , @entity5 , heading to @entity6			1
the reason ? to participate in the " @entity9 , " a mass demonstration in the nation 's capital in support of lgbt rights			1
this was not quite two years after the death of @entity16 , the @entity17 student who was brutally murdered for being gay			1
we were barely two seasons into what was then a groundbreaking television series , " @entity22			1
" @entity23 was so long ago that network executives were still afraid to put an openly gay @entity25 on television			1
that was the social climate then			1
and we were heading to @entity6 to help change it			2
then two transgendered women boarded the bus			1
i wo n't repeat the jokes i whispered about them to my friend and some of the others nearby			2
i 'll just say their presence exposed me for the fraud i did n't even know i was			2
it was the spring of 2000 , and i -- an openly gay man seeking @entity40 equality -- had just rendered the @entity41 silent without even noticing			2
one can only imagine what those women had to endure from people who did n't consider themselves " progressive "			1
fifteen years later , i 'm happy to say i am different			2
the country is different as well			2
but there are many reminders of the work that still needs to be done -- for example the disproportionate murder rate for transgender women and the fact that a person can still be fired or lose a home for being transgender			2
and then there is @entity59			1
when my editor first asked me to write about his reported " journey " she jokingly asked me to be brilliant			2
i responded that i was n't sure if i could be brilliant -- but i promised i would be honest			2
this is why i shared my own past struggles with the issue			1
public gender transitions still uncommon @entity67 is a reality tv star who actively seeks attention			2
but that does n't mean jokes about gender identity are appropriate			0
especially now , as details regarding the fatal car accident @entity74 was involved in during the weekend come to light			0
so far police have said @entity74 was not speeding and alcohol was not a factor			0
and while he told police he was being followed by paparazzi , they said the photographers did not appear to be a factor in causing the accident			0
( @entity74 released a statement , saying , in part , " it is a devastating tragedy , and i can not pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time			1
i am praying for them			0
i will continue to cooperate in every way possible			0
" ) those of us who are cisgender do not know what it is like to look in the mirror and be in conflict with the body that we see , to have our souls be at odds with the gender assigned to us at birth			0
at this point we have read the stories with quotes from unnamed sources and seen the pictures with @entity74 having longer hair and makeup			0
however we have yet to hear from @entity74 himself			0
if he is wrestling with gender identity , being involved in a tragic car accident can only add to what must be an incredibly difficult time for him			1
even someone who seeks the spotlight can hurt			0
when @entity74 does speak , i hope we resist the urge to mock			0
if not for his sake , then for the sake of the countless others who may be able to identify with what @entity74 says			0
according to a recent @entity130 study , 50 % of respondents who are openly transgender attempted suicide			0
unfortunately in december , 17 - year - old @entity131 succeeded			0
" my death needs to mean something , " she wrote in her final @entity133 post			0
the shame of my behavior on that bus 15 years ago re-emerges each time i read that sentence			1
i thought i was just having some harmless fun that day on the bus until i stumbled across a quote from @entity145 that revealed to me the depth of my hypocrisy			0
" you think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world , but then you read			0
it was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive , or who had ever been alive			1
" over time i have learned to replace the urge to judge with the desire to seek our like humanity			1
over the years i have spent my fair share of time around people fighting for lgbt rights and i can tell you the mocking of transgender people is not something that is exclusively heterosexual or conservative			1
it is not only found in red states or in @entity173 homes			0
i have learned a person can be progressive on numerous social issues and still house bigotry in the hidden , dusty corners of an otherwise illuminated heart			0
so as we wait for @entity74 to tell us what his journey is , now would be a good time for many of us to embark on a soul - searching journey of our own			1
we think jokes are harmless because we 're only paying attention to the people who are laughing			1

@entity190 : it 's long past time to take a more mature view of transgendered people
