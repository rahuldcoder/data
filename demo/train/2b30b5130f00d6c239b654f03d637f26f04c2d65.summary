@entity0 -- wandering through central @entity0 ' @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 stop to perch on a sun - soaked bench as they consider their future			1
the couple , who have been dating for two - and - a - half years , belong to @entity11 's post-junta generation , growing up as the country emerged into its modern democracy			1
as @entity11 's turbulent history faded into its past , the country 's political landscape remained fraught with nepotism and mismanagement			1
read more : is @entity11 democracy regressing ? but the boom times had begun			1
@entity11 entered the euro in 2001 , and ex-pat money flooded back into the country			1
it hosted the @entity27 in 2004 , swelling the country with pride			2
but by 2009 -- when the country admitted its deficit was out of control -- the financial mirage evaporated			0
@entity3 , 34 , and 25 - year old @entity4 's generation was caught in the fallout			1
the couple belong to a young professional class that will help shape their country 's future			1
together , they must decide if they are willing to live through -- and help alleviate -- @entity11 's pain			1
their views differ dramatically , and it weighs on their relationship			0
a few meters away from where @entity3 , an electronic mobile technician , and @entity4 , an electronics tester , chat , a man stumbles to his knees , dropping a begging cup			1
grasping for it as it rolls away , he ends up splayed on the ground			0
it 's a disturbing sight , but one which has become increasingly common in @entity0 since austerity measures began to bite			0
@entity11 's poverty , suicide and crime rates have increased alongside unemployment and emigration			1
it is this environment @entity3 wants to leave			1
she dreams of life outside of @entity11 , in the @entity68 or the @entity69 , where she has relatives			2
" i have to go , " she says			0
" i have to leave from here			0
" @entity4 wants to remain			2
" i want to stay and fight , " he says			0
" i do n't want to abandon my country			0
" his reasoning is clear : " i love my country			2
" @entity3 and @entity4 @entity3 and @entity4 began dating after meeting at their workplace , a @entity78 - based telecommunications company			1
the relationship blossomed after , in @entity3 's words , " he saw me there , we became friends , he was trying to approach me in any [ way ] ... and finally after eight months we were together			1
" they moved in together , but say their financial situation has become increasingly difficult as the crisis has unfolded			0
each has taken a significant cut in pay since april , in part because both have seen their work week reduced to four days a week			0
they now earn € 1,160 ( $ 1,415 ) a month between them , down from € 1,480 ( $ 1,805 ) two years ago			0
they pay € 300 ( $ 366 ) in rent and around € 65 ( $ 79 ) a week in groceries , but face extra costs because of the crisis			2
since @entity4 's father 's sculpture business went bankrupt in the recession , the young couple must also help his parents get by , he says			1
neither voted in the june 17 elections , because they could not spare the cash to return to their home villages -- € 15 ( $ 18 ) for @entity3 , and € 40 ( $ 48 ) for @entity4 -- to vote			1
pro-austerity package party @entity111 won the election , despite soaring support for the radical left @entity115 party			2
@entity116 , who heads @entity115 , is , like @entity3 , is in his 30s			2
@entity116 's vociferous rejection of @entity120 's austerity - driven demands for @entity11 appealed to discontented youth , with the party capturing 33 % of 18 to 34 - year - olds , compared to 20 % for @entity111			1
the surge is all the more dramatic given that @entity11 , born in a country where family loyalty is embedded deep in the national psyche , usually vote the way of their forebears			1
@entity3 , for one , would have fallen behind her parents and voted @entity111			2
the party now leads a fragile coalition , but that provides no comfort for @entity3			2
a country fights for its future @entity11 's new government is now renegotiating its bailout package , but there is no guarantee the country will emerge from years of recession			1
and the country could lose people like @entity3 and @entity4 overseas , while those with less hope could give in to despair			1
more than 50 % of working age @entity11 under 26 are without a job			2
those just entering the workforce are particularly hard - hit , with 2011 figures from @entity151 showing 56 % unemployment among those aged 15 to 19			0
around one in four workers under 39 years old are unemployed			0
@entity151 figures show the extent of the exodus of young workers fleeing @entity11 's crisis			1
in 2010 , almost 2.5 % of those in their mid-to - late 20s left the country , while around 2 % of those aged 30 to 34 emigrated			2
dreams of going abroad those choosing to leave must struggle against the desire to stay and help their family , and overcome a deep loyalty to a country which has suffered under civil war , dictatorship , and foreign rule under @entity78 , now its main paymaster			1
those entering the workforce carry a cultural weight of responsibility to family			0
@entity4 's 19 - year - old brother , @entity180 , a student , wants to move to the @entity181 to study fine arts			1
@entity183 attracts him because of its place in art history , and the " country and the color of the sky are beautiful , " he says			0
but any money he earns -- after he 's made enough to get by -- will be sent back to @entity11 , to help his family			1
@entity192 , a 23 - year - old soldier , also wants to go abroad , and study political science			0
but he wants to return , to break his generation 's " consciousness of dependency			2
" @entity11 , he believes , needs to " rise up and develop its own power , to protect our people 's benefits			1
economically and politically , we need to rise up			0
" the country 's next generation needs to be taught the value of productivity , he believes			1
the crisis represents a chance " to change people 's minds ...			2
to abolish the mentality of dependency			0
" coming back home some of those who have left @entity11 have already returned in an effort to help the country they love			1
@entity216 , a 27 - year - old who works in policy at humanitarian organization @entity218 studied at the @entity219 , while @entity220 , a 33 - year - old investment banker studied at @entity222			0
although their educations opened a world of possibility , both opted to forgo careers abroad to return to @entity0			0
@entity216 says when her studies in @entity229 were coming to an end last year , she knew it was time to " feed my heart not my mind			0
" @entity216 and @entity220 describe @entity11 as a country where one always cooks extra food in preparation for a guest , where a feisty debate over sport will end with friendly drink , and where parents maintain close contact with children after they leave home			1
but this often idyllic country today finds itself immersed in anger and fear			0
and @entity216 , who is passionate about helping the vulnerable and now works with drug addicts , says she does n't know which is more dangerous			0
" i 'm afraid for other people and myself , " she says			0
with the option to work overseas , she believes she may be forced to leave , due to @entity11 's lack of opportunities			1
" i have the chance , i have the choice to decide to live abroad			0
if i am forced to do it , i can do it , " she says			0
@entity220 believes the country can -- should it follow the example of others , such as @entity263 -- restructure itself into a viable @entity120 economy			0
the revelations of its financial irresponsibility , which led the spiral into bailout , were akin to the country being caught " skinny - dipping " when the tide went out , he says			2
@entity220 wants to see the country 's red - tape unraveled to allow investment into its promising industries such as tourism and shipping			1
the problems for @entity11 are structural , he says , and that can be a " glass half full ... you can see that as an opportunity			2
[ if ] you realize you have a problem , you can transform how you do business			0
" the way he sees it : " the game is not lost but we are two goals behind			0
" @entity4 also sees opportunity in @entity11 's future , and he is not afraid of the pain that may still come			1
" my country [ during ] its history has passed many greater disasters			0
so i am not afraid			0
" for @entity4 , there is one answer to a difficult question			2
it goes against his wishes but he will put his relationship with @entity3 ahead of his country			1
" i love [ @entity3 ] , and i will follow her			1
i will sacrifice , " he says .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 are in love , but they disagree over whether to stay in @entity11 or leave
the couple belong to a generation *devastated* by the country 's economic crisis
others who have left @entity11 come back to contribute to the *recovery* of their *homeland*
the country 's young face such *dilemmas* even as politicians try and renegotiate the bailout package
