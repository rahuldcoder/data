@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 will take another look at an 11 - year - old boy 's request to have @entity7 listed as his place of birth on his @entity3 passport			1
the justices announced monday they would review a federal law giving that special right to those like young @entity13 , who were born in @entity14			1
but that is a disputed region in the eyes of the @entity19 administration , which said the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations , not by a 2002 congressional action favoring the family and the more than 50,000 other @entity3 born in the holy city			1
oral arguments by the high court will be held in the fall			0
at issue is whether the statute interferes with the president 's power to recognize an independent sovereign			1
the case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority , with foreign policy the source of the current controversy			0
@entity3 policy does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over @entity14			1
two years ago , the justices allowed the family 's federal lawsuit to proceed			0
the city is home to @entity47 and @entity48			0
the couple and their two oldest children were born in the @entity3 , but the family migrated to @entity14 more than a dozen years ago , and in 2002 the youngest , @entity53 , was born			1
the boy 's mother made the " @entity7 " request about two months after his birth , but embassy officials refused			1
the disputed passport shows his round , innocent face , and " @entity14 " is listed as his place of birth			1
" we 're very proud of the fact that he was born in @entity7 and that we live in @entity7 and it 's the modern state of @entity7 , " @entity63 told @entity1 in 2012			1
" religiously and historically , that 's very significant			0
" just three weeks before @entity13 was born , the @entity68 gave @entity3 citizens born in @entity14 the individual discretion to ask that @entity7 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity73			1
" president @entity74 signed the bill but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply			0
it is not the first time @entity68 and the @entity79 have clashed over the region			0
the @entity3 embassy remains in @entity82 , over @entity3 lawmakers ' objections			2
the government is thinking of the bigger picture			0
@entity88 officials would not comment on the record on a pending case , but president @entity19 has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the @entity3			2
the high court case is @entity13 v. @entity95 , but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world , and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence : @entity14			2
its name translates as " @entity104 " to some , " @entity105 " to others			0
@entity14 is @entity7 's largest city , and the nation calls it its capital , though that is not recognized by the @entity110 and most of the world community			1
divided into @entity113 ( populated mostly by @entity114 ) and @entity14 ( populated mostly by @entity115 ) , the city spans over 48 square miles ( 124 square kilometers ) , with about 775,000 people			2
the terms " @entity118 " and " @entity14 " come layered with political , social , religious and geographic questions -- amorphous , often misleading terms , symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents			2
some use the terms " @entity115 " or " @entity128 " @entity14 to refer to the sections			2
the @entity130 is the heart of the region , a holy symbol to the three major @entity135 religions : @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
that tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
the case is @entity13 v. @entity95 ( 13 - 628 )			0
in 2011 : high court looks at passports and presidential power @entity2 says 9 - year - old can pursue passport suit			1

2002 law lets @entity3 citizens born in @entity14 ask that @entity7 be listed as *birthplace* on passports
the @entity3 does *n't* recognize any country as having sovereignty over @entity14
at issue is whether the law interferes with presidential power
