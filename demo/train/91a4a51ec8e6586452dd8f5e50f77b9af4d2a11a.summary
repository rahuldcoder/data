-- three years after @entity5 's devastating earthquake , more than a third of the country 's hospitals are still not functional			1
a cholera outbreak has killed more than 7,000 people and overwhelmed the already - reeling health care system			1
three out of the four medical schools in @entity5 were damaged in the january 2010 quake , which killed the entire second - year class at the nation 's largest nursing school			1
in all , more than 200,000 people perished in the magnitude - 7.0 earthquake			0
despite this bleak outlook , dr. @entity17 says he feels " blessed every day			1
" @entity17 , a doctor at the @entity19 , runs a health clinic in @entity21 that 's managed to serve 10,000 patients since it opened more than a year ago			1
in a country where so many things seem to go wrong , his program and others like it stand as a suggestion that it has been possible , at least to some extent , to make a difference in health in @entity5			1
@entity17 's clinic tends to @entity5 with wounds and spinal cord injuries			1
other programs have successfully vaccinated children , distributed condoms and brought down malaria rates			1
" there are major failings in our system , " says dr. @entity40 , an adviser in disease prevention and control to the @entity43 , a part of the @entity45			0
" but at the same time , there 's some hope the system can really get back on its feet			0
" @entity5 still reeling from quake country club dinners and a $ 100,000 check according to @entity58 , malaria rates in @entity5 are now under 1 % , down from 5 % seven years ago , thanks in large part to wide distribution of mosquito nets treated with insecticides by his group			1
last year , a major vaccination campaign against diseases such as measles and rubella reached 90 % of children under 9 , he said			1
about 2.2 % of the population has @entity73 , when many had thought by now it would be around 5 % , he added			0
condom distribution has helped keep that rate relatively low , he said			0
these programs were funded by large groups such as the @entity43 , @entity80 @entity81 and @entity80 president 's @entity82			2
other programs , such as @entity17 's clinic , rely on smaller donors and some level of serendipity			1
@entity17 , a wound care specialist , says he was devastated to see people dying in @entity5 after the quake from wounds that could have been easily treated			1
it was more than just wounds from the earthquake			0
women had cuts in their breasts where cancerous tumors had erupted through the skin ; men had grotesque genital swelling caused by infection ; children had maggot - filled wounds on their scalps			0
@entity17 yearned to start a clinic just for wound care			1
in 2011 , he pleaded his case to a potential donor during lunch at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			0
a man who 'd been sitting at the next table walked over about 40 minutes into @entity17 's pitch			1
" he said , ' i 'm a lawyer , and i have a client who has an interest in @entity5 and is in a charitable mood			2
would you speak with him ? ' " @entity17 recalls			2
his answer , of course , was yes			0
a few months later , @entity17 had lunch at the same country club with the lawyer 's client , a @entity131 - @entity130 businessman , and at the end of the meal , @entity17 was handed a check for $ 100,000			1
" his wife was with us and she was crying , and at first i thought it was because this was her jewelry money , but she was crying because she was so happy , " @entity17 says			2
@entity5 living in fear ' under the tent ' that check gave birth to a wound clinic in conjunction with hospital @entity146 in @entity21 and @entity148 , a group started by doctors at the @entity19			1
about 50 patients a day come into the clinic , and in addition there 's a 10 - bed ward for people suffering spinal injuries			2
a second check for $ 100,000 from the same donor , who 's asked to remain anonymous , has kept the clinic going into a second year			2
@entity17 spends about a week a month at the clinic , which @entity5 staff mostly run			1
" this is a very important program , and we want to expand it , " says dr. @entity163 , who founded @entity164 with her husband and other family members			0
' a three - ring circus and a brothel ' finding the funds to stay operating in @entity5 is all about persistence , says dr. @entity174 , international medical director of @entity164 / @entity148			2
" if you get a ' no ' in one area , you just go in another direction to accomplish the same goal , " @entity174 says			0
@entity17 agrees but makes another observation			0
" being a doctor in @entity5 is like being a doctor for a three - ring circus and a brothel , " he says			2
" on the one hand , you look and see all this amazing talent doing all these incredible feats			0
but there 's also stuff going on behind closed doors you do n't want to know about -- corruption , people taking money			0
" the trick is to not pass judgment , he says			0
" you 're a guest in someone else 's country , " he says			0
" you 're fascinated , and helpless to walk away			0
" @entity5 transitions from relief to rebuilding			0
