from @entity43 to the well - stocked shelves of @entity46 stores nationwide , guns are regarded in the @entity2 as a commonplace if controversial consumer item for millions of law - abiding hunters , collectors and citizens concerned about their safety			1

" " guns are at the center of much of @entity2 's history , its legends , and its horrors			1
" there were guns in @entity2 long before the @entity2 we know today was even born			1
early settlers in several states were required by law to own and maintain weapons as a matter of collective defense			0
by the time the @entity2 was established , its citizens had taken up arms not only against their @entity102 neighbors but the army of their own king			2
their new @entity105 reflected that in its @entity109 , declaring that " a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed			0
