-- when @entity3 's mother began showing the first signs of dementia 16 years ago , @entity1 worried she was doomed to the same fate			1
so @entity1 began reading up on what she could do to stay mentally sharp			2
@entity1 , now 55 , grew up on a farm where her mother fried just about everything in lard			2
today , she skips the fried foods and eats plenty of fruits and vegetables , takes fish oil pills , goes for regular walks and meditates during a weekly yoga class			0
" i 'm doing everything i can , " says @entity1 , a public speaker and author who lives in @entity24 , @entity25			0
and what 's the point ? doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable , even in very old age			1
making positive lifestyle changes earlier in life , they say , can lessen the chances of the faulty thinking and flagging memory that often come with advancing years			1
dr. @entity37 , director of @entity39 's @entity38 , says lifestyle may play a bigger role than genetics when it comes to who will fall into what he calls the " mental fog " of dementia			1
@entity48 's is perhaps the best known and most feared form of dementia			1
early onset alzheimer 's disease , which often has a strong genetic component , may not be delayed with any lifestyle changes			1
but late - life @entity48 , affecting people in their 80s and 90s , has only a minor genetic component and can be delayed or prevented with lifestyle changes -- especially if the changes begin in midlife , says dr. @entity61 , chairman of the @entity62 and a neurology professor at @entity64			1
i say , ' dance ' @entity61 began ballroom dancing when he was a student at @entity68			0
it was a break from all the studying			0
more than that , it was fun			0
now a neurologist , @entity61 still dances			0
he and his wife , @entity74 , have mastered the tango			0
as an expert on how the brain ages , @entity61 sees another benefit : dancing is the perfect activity to keep the brain young			1
" when people say , ' what 's the one thing i can do ? ' i say , ' dance			1
the answer to keeping the brain sharp , neurologists agree , is not sudoku or crossword puzzles -- despite the conventional wisdom			1
staying physically fit is the most important element to keeping the brain young later in life , they say			1
remaining socially engaged and mentally active in new and challenging ways are the two other components to long - term brain health			1
@entity61 says ballroom dancing is perfect because it combines physical activity , social interaction and the mental challenge of remembering the steps			0
growing the brain using new , more powerful mri scanners , researchers have shown how even moderate exercise can actually increase the size of the hippocampus , the part of the brain responsible for forming memories , essentially turning back the clock and making the brain younger			1
" we have found this treasure , this amazing phenomenon that the brain can grow , " @entity61 says			1
after 50 , the brain -- and the hippocampus -- typically begins losing volume			1
the hippocampus loses 1 % of its volume every two years and accelerates up to 2 % per year later in life			1
but this loss is not set in stone			0
dr. @entity124 at the @entity125 and his colleagues took 120 older adults and put half of them into an exercise group , which walked three days a week , and the other half on a stretching regimen			1
after a year , the group that walked had better memory than at the start of the study			0
more than that , mri scans showed that hippocampal volume increased , on average , by 2 % , effectively making their brains a year or two younger			2
the brains of the group that stretched continued to age			0
" this is cutting edge			0
we can reverse the atrophy that happens to the brain with aging , particularly the hippocampus , " says @entity61 , author of " @entity144			1
" a study at the @entity151 showed that exercise improved the thinking speed of previously sedentary people in their 80s			2
staying in shape helps maintain a healthy blood flow to the brain , critically important because blood vessels make up one - third of the brain 's volume			1
but @entity162 , the study 's lead author , says the benefits to the brain of such modest exercise as walking three times a week appear to exceed the small improvement in overall fitness that exercise offers , though she 's not sure why			1
one hypothesis : walking is often a social activity , which engages the brain			2
it also may elevate the mood of the walker			0
begin early exercise does n't help just the elderly			2
another @entity125 study found an association between aerobic fitness , hippocampus size and memory performance in preadolescent children			1
@entity39 's @entity37 says the focus on keeping the brain healthy should begin early			1
" my opinion is we should begin in school , " says @entity37 , author of " the @entity186 , " scheduled for publication in january			0
" the earlier you get started , the more you 're going to benefit from it			2
" @entity61 uses the analogy of saving for retirement			0
the more " savings " you build up with a brain - healthy lifestyle , the better off you 'll be in your 60s and beyond			1
a model life if @entity61 was looking for someone who has done everything right , he 'd have trouble finding anyone more on the ball than 91 - year - old @entity205			2
" i 've lived a fairly healthy life			2
i try to keep my mind as tranquil as possible , not get too upset about anything , " says @entity205 , a retired professor of biochemistry at the @entity208			0
@entity205 belongs to the @entity211 , attends a class on @entity214 literature and discusses the classics -- in @entity214 -- and attends a weekly conversation circle , also in @entity214			0
she does tai chi and goes to the gym three times a week for weightlifting , core strengthening and stretching			0
" i keep myself busy , and i keep my mind engaged , " @entity205 says			0
" these are the things that keep me happy			0
" mothers and daughters in @entity25 , @entity1 's mother , @entity226 , went on blood thinners more than 11 years ago			2
doctors were worried about a massive stroke because the arteries leading to her brain were dangerously narrowed by plaque			1
even so , @entity3 says , her mother 's condition has progressed to the point where she no longer recognizes her during visits			2
but @entity1 , who has a daughter of her own , says she no longer fears dementia			2
" i have a lot of friends			0
they 're scared to death , " @entity1 says			0
" i 'm not so scared			0
education and awareness make a difference			0

doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable
making positive lifestyle changes earlier in life can lessen your chances , they say
@entity48 's is perhaps the best known and most feared form of dementia
even moderate exercise can actually increase the size of the brain 's hippocampus
