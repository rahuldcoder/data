-- the legacy of the @entity2 vs. the @entity3 looms large in @entity4 , @entity5			2
now , in the same mountainous county along the @entity9 state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago , two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates			2
and there are claims of sham investigations and " punishment " that in one case allegedly amounted to denying the accused an ice - cream break			2
the case moved behind closed doors friday at the @entity4 courthouse , where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state 's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a @entity4 middle school			1
@entity5 attorney general @entity36 filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh - grade boys			1
according to the filing , abuse of the two 13 - year - old @entity46 students , also in the seventh grade , took place on multiple occasions between november 2012 and may 2013			1
the attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert : one would restrain their victim while the other groped her " breasts , genitalia ( and ) buttocks			1
" most of the alleged attacks @entity36 outlines in the filing took place at the school , except for a class trip to the state capital of @entity65 , where one of the girls said she was raped			2
names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released , but the attorney general 's court filing identifies the suspects as @entity73 , and states they are both relatives of employees of the @entity4 school system			1
@entity4 prosecuting attorney @entity77 told @entity0 that she first learned of the investigation last week after @entity36 filed the request for an injunction			2
she said she met with the attorney general on friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it did n't take her very long to show that she meant it : @entity86 filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on friday			1
she would not divulge what those charges were			0
@entity86 has not brought charges against any other parties , but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges			1
attorney general @entity36 declined to be interviewed for this article , but @entity109 lt. @entity108 explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by @entity36 in this case -- is an " extreme " court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case , the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment			1
the attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied			1
as abhorrent as the allegations are themselves , @entity121 says they are not why he is taking this action ; he 's doing that because , he said " the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest			0
" that may seem like an understatement in a 32 - page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence , connected suspects , sham investigations , deceitful and vengeful administrators , and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement			2
@entity4 , going back to the @entity3 days , has earned an unsavory reputation , thanks to nepotism , cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption			0
in the last few years @entity4 's sheriff was assassinated , its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case , and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion			2
just this week , the mayor of the county 's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers ' compensation case			0
not even the @entity4 school system seems to be immune from controversy			1
court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh - grade sexual assault allegations , and claim that " a relative of ( one of the boys ) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against ( him ) , and involved in decisions relating to the discipline / punishment of the male juvenile offenders			1
" that investigation , according to @entity36 's injunction request , was " ineffective , non-existent , ( and ) designed ( to ) illicit contradictory and / or less incriminating statements from the female victims			0
" when punishment was doled out , the attorney general characterized it as a mockery			1
in one instance , for example , a school official " ' disciplined ' ( the boys ) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing , " the attorney general 's court filing said			1
the attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet			2
@entity36 's complaint said @entity46 teachers and administrators " threatened ( the girls ) with discipline " to dissuade them from coming forward , and the alleged victims were retaliated against when they did			0
the day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in april 2014 , she was written up for bullying			0
@entity36 wrote that the " bullying " was actually the victim blocking her @entity211 account from the niece of a teacher at the school			0
the next day she was written up again , this time for " insubordination , " according to the filing			0
the attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well : the injunction request states that a high - ranking @entity228 official " retaliated against ( her ) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level			1
" when @entity230 showed up at @entity228 on april 24 , the principal refused to allow a trooper to take a statement from a possible third victim , according to the court filing			0
the principal " went an additional step further and informed the @entity236 investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at @entity46 because it ' disrupted the learning environment			0
' " @entity0 tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at @entity46 named in the filing for comment on the allegations , but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned			0
@entity251 , the attorney representing the @entity252 and the @entity4 school superintendent , released a statement that said " the @entity252 is committed to working with the attorney general 's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner			1
the hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue			0
we take these allegations very seriously			0
be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of @entity4			0
" @entity0 's @entity266 contributed to this report .			0
