-- as attackers target reporters and governments shut down television stations , @entity1 ranks among the most dangerous regions for journalists , according to an @entity9 report released friday nearly 400 journalists were threatened or attacked in the @entity12 in 2010 , and at least 13 were killed by unidentified assailants , the human rights organization said in its annual report			1
" in many cases , those killed were believed to have been targeted because of their efforts to uncover corruption or to expose the links between officials and criminal networks , " @entity9 's annual report says			1
@entity24 is one of the worst offenders , said @entity27 , a special adviser on human rights at @entity9			1
in that country alone , he said , 11 journalists have been killed since the beginning of 2010			1
" it 's a sense of impunity that feeds into more killings and more abuses throughout the continent , especially in @entity24 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , " he said			1
@entity9 's report also cites @entity41 and the @entity42 , where the organization said government officials shut down " a significant number of tv stations			1
" over the past week , press freedom advocates have highlighted several incidents in the region			2
on wednesday , the @entity50 called on authorities to investigate the killing of a @entity38 journalist who was reportedly shot in the back outside his home this week			1
cable television host @entity59 had been threatened several times over the past six months as he reported on corruption in the local mayor 's office and regional land disputes , the @entity57 - based organization said			1
" it is unacceptable that @entity59 had reported being threatened and was not given protection , " cpj deputy director @entity64 said in a statement			2
@entity69 's government also drew criticism from the organization last week as voters across the country headed to the polls for a referendum on proposals that included the creation of a council to regulate media content			2
another controversial proposal would prevent media owners and their shareholders from owning stock in any company outside of that industry			2
@entity69 president @entity85 has said that if approved , the measure would prevent conflicts of interest , but others see it differently			0
" we believe the referendum questions are aimed at stifling voices that oppose your administration , " cpj executive director @entity91 wrote in a letter to @entity85			0
@entity85 has said all 10 referendum proposals passed , but authorities were still counting votes thursday			0
in a visit to @entity105 last week , a delegation from the @entity103 accused the @entity108 country 's government of cracking down on press freedom			0
@entity105 president @entity110 spearheaded a controversial audio - visual communication policy in 2008 that critics said was aimed at hobbling the holdings of the @entity115 media company			0
@entity116 has accused @entity115 of unfairly criticizing her administration			0
but the implications of @entity1 's struggle over press freedom could stretch far beyond the region 's borders , @entity9 's @entity27 said			0
" the @entity12 should be a lesson for what might happen in the future in the @entity126 and @entity127 , " he said			0
even though military regimes collapsed in many @entity1 countries , he said , " the culture of impunity and repression remained			0
" @entity0 's @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report .			2
