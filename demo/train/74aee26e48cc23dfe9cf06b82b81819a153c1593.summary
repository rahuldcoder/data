@entity0 -- it was a fleeting moment , but one that @entity4 censors were quick to snuff out			1
at an @entity8 event to watch the fireworks in @entity10 on monday night , @entity6 president @entity5 created a few of his own by slipping a shawl over the shoulders of @entity14 , wife of @entity4 president @entity15			1
a smiling @entity14 kindly accepted the offer , but seconds later deftly slipped the shawl off into the hands of a waiting aide			2
the small act of chivalry , quickly but politely rebuffed , unfolded live on state television , with voiceover from a @entity24 anchor stating simply : " president @entity5 has placed a coat on @entity14			1
" a hashtag based on the same words quickly gained momentum on social media where the video was posted and reposted , according to @entity32			1
however , by morning , there was little trace of it left			0
searches for the video and hashtag on @entity4 's twitter - like @entity39 and messaging service @entity40 turned up a smattering of comments and broken links , leaving users to surmise that @entity4 's internet police had deemed the material too potentially damaging to share			1
some remained though , including this link to the photo with the loosely translated comment : " @entity4 's first lady 's boundless charm wins over mr. @entity5			1
" a still image seems to show @entity5 glancing in @entity15 's direction as he draped the shawl			2
there 's been no comment from @entity15 , who was sitting nearby , talking with an aide and president @entity59 during the exchange , which has been dubbed " coatgate " by some media outlets			2
@entity4 's state news agency , @entity62 , had no reporting on the incident , nor did state television network , @entity24			1
it remains unclear what @entity5 's intentions were			2
was he trying to further warm relations with @entity10 ? or was there just a chill in the air ? some international media saw a whole lot more			0
the headline in the @entity76 announced that @entity5 " cracks on to " the first lady			0
@entity79 said he " flirts with " @entity14 , while @entity32 went with " hits on			0
" a president 's seating arrangement has n't attracted this much attention since @entity59 was seen laughing with @entity85 prime minister @entity84 at @entity87 's funeral			0
at least @entity5 did n't try to snap a selfie			0
that would have really sent the censors into overdrive			0
