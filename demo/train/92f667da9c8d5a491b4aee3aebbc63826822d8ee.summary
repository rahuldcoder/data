-- pay no attention to the title : @entity4 's new shoot - the - works epic " @entity8 of @entity9 " is n't about rapacious stockbrokers or shady financial shenanigans			1
lots and lots of drugs			2
from its twisted opening scene , where a floor of coked - up boiler - room meatheads toss dwarfs for bacchanalian sport , the feverishly paced film is hell - bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a @entity25 mountain of blow			1
you can practically feel your teeth grinding to dust			0
as with any high , though , it also does n't know when to stop			0
from ' @entity35 ' to ' mr. @entity36 , ' the season 's films make music into magic based on @entity9 evil genius @entity45 's 2007 memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors , " @entity43 " stars @entity41 as an amoral @entity42 with a rolled @entity39 up his nose			1
he gives a hell of a performance that 's electrifyingly loose , perversely funny , and dripping with jerk charisma			2
like @entity53 in " @entity54 , " @entity41 's character explains through wise - guy voice - overs how he pulled off one of the most brazen and boneheaded scams in history			1
the film chronicles @entity45 's improbable ascent from eager brokerage - house trainee ( under the gonzo tutelage of a scene - stealing @entity62 ) to black monday casualty to silver - tongued swindler , cold - calling suckers to peddle them worthless stocks out of a former auto - body garage			1
@entity69 : which never - nominated actors really deserve a nod ? he proves to be such a born salesman that in no time he and his merry band of macho @entity75 , @entity76 , goombahs ( led by a terrific @entity78 as @entity45 's bucktoothed loose - cannon sidekick ) have more money than they know what to do with			1
so they blow it on bond - villain yachts , trophy wives , and insane quantities of coke			0
soon the firm becomes a millionaire - minting mecca , attracting both wannabe @entity90 and the attention of a hungry @entity93 agent ( @entity92 ) who drools over @entity45 's nouveau - riche toys while vowing to bring the drug - fueled @entity95 down			1
it says something about @entity41 's oily charm that you almost want him to get away with it			1
as bad judgment and paranoia take hold and the high rollers get careless about stashing their loot in @entity109 banks , " @entity43 's " pace never stops panting			1
and you ca n't help but be amazed that it 's the work of a 71 - year - old			0
after five decades behind the camera , @entity4 still works with the frantic energy of a man who 's got something to prove			2
but the director also has to know that his film could have used some trimming			2
clocking in at just a minute under three hours , " @entity43 " starts to repeat itself as we 're given one scene after another of men behaving badly			2
if you 're feeling charitable , you could argue that the movie 's running time is meant to mirror its theme of excess			0
then again , you could also say that it 's just way too long			0
there 's a reason roller - coaster rides last for only a few minutes			0
still , @entity4 has pulled off something tricky with " @entity43 " : he 's given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what he 's done			1
if anything , he just had the bad luck to get caught			0
