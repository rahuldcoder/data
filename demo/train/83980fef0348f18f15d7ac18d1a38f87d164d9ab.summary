@entity0 -- look both ways			2
that is probably the first traffic safety advice most people get			2
but in 2011 , some 4,432 pedestrians were killed in the simple act of crossing a street			1
those accounted for 14 % of all motor vehicle fatalities			0
on monday , the @entity11 @entity10 released updated pedestrian accident statistics in a bid to increase pedestrian safety			1
here are six things you should know : 1 ) sobriety is key			0
in 48 % of fatal pedestrian accidents , either the driver or the pedestrian was drunk			1
of pedestrians involved , 35 % had blood - alcohol levels of .08 %			0
of the drivers involved , 13 % had levels of .08			0
alcohol , the @entity25 noted , impairs both your walking ability and judgment			1
2 ) it helps to use a crosswalk			0
seventy percent of pedestrian fatalities occurred away from intersections , compared with 19 % at intersections			1
( the remainder were listed as " other			0
" ) 3 ) @entity36 is more dangerous			2
seventy percent of the fatalities occurred at night			0
4 ) most accidents occur in cities			1
three out of every four pedestrian fatalities happen in urban areas			2
5 ) weekends are worse : thirty - nine percent of pedestrian fatalities occur during weekend nights , compared with 27 % during weekday nights			1
6 ) males are represented in larger numbers			0
more than two - thirds of all pedestrians killed are male			0
males are overrepresented in every age group , from 0 - 5 to 85 - plus			0
one more thing : @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 had the highest pedestrian fatality rates ; @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 had the lowest			1
the @entity25 has launched a website with safety tips and resources for parents , city planners and others involved in improving pedestrian safety .			1
