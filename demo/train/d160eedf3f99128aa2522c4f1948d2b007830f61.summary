fared even better than expected , bringing in $ 36.6 million over the weekend across 3,141 theaters			1
for comparison , @entity4 's last major film bridesmaids ( though it was in a supporting role ) opened at $ 26.2 million , in 2,918 theaters			1
with an opening like this , big things are surely expected from @entity13 's r - rated comedy which has already surpassed its $ 35 million production budget			1
though @entity15 and @entity13 had a successful run with @entity17 after a $ 28.3 million opening weekend in july 2011 , @entity15 has n't had this kind of luck with most of his starring roles			1
@entity22 's @entity21 ( with @entity23 ) opened at $ 13.5 million in august 2011 and went on to gross only $ 37.1 million domestically , on a $ 52 million production budget			1
@entity26 's @entity25 took second place for its second weekend with $ 11.5 million , bringing its domestic total to $ 36.7 million			1
this breaks @entity26 's record , beating the lifetime domestic gross of his last feature , the cancer dramedy 50/50 with @entity34 and @entity35 , which brought in $ 35 million			2
the @entity37 - style , prescription - drug thriller @entity38 ( @entity1 : @entity1 ) ended up beating director @entity41 's january 2012 weekend opening of @entity42 , earning $ 10 million weekend this weekend and averaging $ 3,845 per theater			1
we talked a little bit about stars @entity46 and @entity49 's box office history yesterday			0
another star of @entity38 is @entity51 , and he 's got a varied track record at the box office			0
he generally participates in ensemble casts -- @entity55 , the @entity57 franchise , @entity58 , @entity59 -- making his singular box office appeal somewhat more elusive			0
@entity38 has @entity41 's name and another strong ensemble , and could go on to a respectable run , even though it wo n't reach contagion heights ( the epidemic thriller eventually grossed $ 76 million )			2
@entity0 reviews : ' @entity67 ' rounding out the top five are @entity69 and @entity70 : @entity71			0
the @entity72 - nominated @entity69 is now at a cool $ 90 million domestically			2
the @entity75 's $ 21 million @entity74 feature is steadily on its way to becoming a $ 100 million movie			2
this would be a first for @entity74 whose the fighter came close with $ 93.6 million in domestic grosses			2
the $ 83 million @entity70 : @entity71 came in fifth place this weekend with $ 5.8 million , bumping its domestic total to $ 43.8 million			1
notably , the @entity84 vehicle is doing quite well overseas with $ 84 million			0
