, appeared on a weeklong @entity10 series in which he introduced yet another acronym to describe a new group of emerging economies , the " @entity14 " ( @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 )			1
the @entity4 acronym kindled a lot of interest among investors eager to find the next " big thing , " while increasing attention to a group of nations that suffered from ongoing economic crisis during the 1990s			1
but considering that the @entity4 economies have not done so well in recent years , perhaps it 's not a good idea to introduce another acronym			1
doing so suggests that we focus on these nations ' economies while overlooking key differences in their political , economic , and social welfare systems			0
while working as @entity2 ' chief economist in 2001 , @entity1 was struck by how fast @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , and @entity8 's economies were growing			0
this motivated him to introduce the @entity4 acronym in a @entity2 working paper titled " @entity41			1
" even from an economic point of view , in recent years , though , the @entity4 have not done so well			1
@entity5 's gdp growth level declined from 7.5 % in 2010 to 0.9 % in 2012 , ; @entity6 's from 4.5 % in 2010 to 1.3 % in 2013 ; @entity7 's from 10.5 % in 2010 to approximately 4.4 % in 2013 , while @entity8 's decreased from 10.4 % in 2010 to a still substantial 7.6 % in 2013			0
using the @entity4 acronym also obscures the fact that these nations are rather different , ranging from democratic to authoritarian regimes			1
the @entity4 vary considerably in their health and educational outcomes			2
while @entity5 and @entity8 have relatively successful public health care systems , @entity5 's educational system lacks adequate resources and has n't succeeded at building a skilled work force , while @entity8 's education system is producing a large number of skilled college graduates			0
@entity6 and @entity7 's governments are failing to adequately invest in health and education , the product of a lack of political commitment and inadequate funding			0
despite the appeal of the @entity14 idea , those countries are not looking too good either			2
most are seeing lowered rates of economic growth			0
because of a decline in exports and industrial production , the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) slashed @entity15 's predicted gdp growth rate from 3.9 % in 2012 to 2.9 in 2013 and 3.2 % in 2014			2
in @entity16 , the @entity74 projected that economic growth will slow from 5.6 % in 2013 to 5.3 % in 2014 , considerably lower than the 6.2 % average in 2012			2
according to the @entity69 , however , @entity17 's gdp growth is expected to rise from 6.2 % in 2013 to 7.4 % in 2014 , the product of increased oil exports , economic stability , and increased domestic consumption			2
yet the situation in @entity18 is n't as peachy			2
gdp growth decreased from 9.2 % in 2010 to 3.6 % in 2013 , with an @entity85 forecast of 3.8 % in 2014			0
and just as with the @entity4 nations , the @entity14 exhibit different political institutions			1
@entity15 and @entity16 are presidential democracies with relatively stable political coalitions			1
@entity17 is also a presidential democracy challenged by political corruption and ethnic conflict			0
and @entity18 has struggled with corruption and a lack of toleration for dissent			0
while @entity15 and @entity18 have succeeded in extending universal health care coverage for the poor and providing medical services , their education system , as well as @entity16 and @entity17 's , are weak , leading to a low level of college graduates and a small skilled labor force			1
@entity16 and @entity17 's health care systems have also had insufficient resources , doctors and nurses			1
adopting the @entity14 acronym could lead us to expect too much , too soon			1
there 's a lot more to an emerging nation than its economy : if citizens lack good health care and access to quality education , the country is unlikely to realize its potential			0
indeed , even @entity1 admits that it 'll take at least 30 years to see if the @entity14 become economic powerhouses			0
therefore , let 's give the @entity14 a bit more time to nurture their economies , strengthen their political institutions , and more importantly , invest in their people before we make them models for the rest of the world			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

inventor of the @entity4 *concept* has a new acronym for a group of nations to watch
@entity134 : the notion of @entity14 may have similar flaws to the @entity4
@entity14 nations -- @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 -- face big and different challenges , he says
give them time to develop further before making them models for the world , he says
