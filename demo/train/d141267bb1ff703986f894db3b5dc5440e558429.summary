-- if you 've ever griped about being mired in a traffic jam , there was proof this weekend in @entity5 that it could have been worse			1
the backup sunday afternoon on part of the main highway between @entity9 and @entity10 -- the country 's two most populated cities -- stretched 125 miles long , according to media reports cited by state - run @entity15 news			1
@entity16 showed fog , but little evident precipitation after days of heavy snow			1
even so , movement along sections of the m - 10 highway largely was limited to foot traffic , not vehicular traffic , as trucks and cars sat motionless			2
efforts to clear roads had some impact by early evening , by which time tie - ups were down to 34 miles along the @entity22 , reported the @entity32 , a division of @entity5 's @entity33			2
the length of the traffic jam was shrinking about three - fourths of a mile every hour , a spokesman for that agency told the state news outlet			2
that is an improvement , but still a far cry from the " normalization " of traffic that @entity5 's @entity44 said would occur by 6 p.m. sunday , according to @entity15			1
an @entity44 spokesman reported that , by then , one lane in each direction of the @entity22 was clear of snow -- allowing trucks to creep along at 5 - 10 kph ( 3 - 6 mph )			2
blame for the slow slog goes , at least in part , to bad weather			0
the traffic headaches began friday , when heavy snow began falling in western @entity5			1
by the time it finally tapered off , three feet had fallen			0
while snow and related traffic woes are hardly unprecedented in @entity5 in december , drivers had other reasons to complain			1
in comments on social networking and news websites , as related by @entity15 , stuck drivers and passengers reported cafes along the clogged roadway took advantage of them by ratcheting up prices			0
others said some gas stations had run out of fuel , or grumbled that authorities were n't much help			0
@entity16 showed an inflatable tent popped up on the side of highway , with tables inside full of people filling up on food and drinks			0
in addition to hot food and warming stations , the @entity15 report noted the @entity44 was making psychological support available to those having trouble coping with the days - long traffic nightmare			0
" ( emergencies minister @entity90 ) is making sure that all necessary measures are being taken and that all vital personnel in afflicted regions have everything they need , " a ministry spokesman said .			0

heavy snow starting friday caused traffic woes in western @entity5
by sunday afternoon , backups on a major highway reportedly stretched 125 miles
