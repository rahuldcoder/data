when nature calls for male members of the @entity3 , they only have to walk steps to answer			2
but for the some 100 female members , it 's not so easy			2
the women have to walk off the @entity3 floor , through what is usually a sea of tourists in @entity12 to reach the ladies ' restroom			1
that gender inequality among the nation 's elected representatives , baffled rep. @entity18 , @entity19 , so much , that she wanted to show us as part of her exit interview before leaving @entity23			1
" you have to go not only through @entity12 , and you have to go through kind of an anteroom , then you get down to the @entity3			0
so it 's quite a ways , " said @entity18 , motioning all the way across @entity12 towards the @entity3 floor , which you ca n't even see from the ladies lounge			1
( @entity31 was placed closer to the @entity3 floor at the order of house speaker @entity33 in 2011			0
) @entity18 is known as a hard charging polarizing conservative - not so much as a feminist wanting to shine a light on how far women still have to go for parity in politics			1
but she knew the whole story of how even the original women 's restroom came to be - thanks to former female rep @entity42 , wife of famous former @entity43 , for making it happen			1
officially , it is called the @entity46			0
" they said well , there 's a broom closet over here off of @entity12 , " she said , pointing to what is now the ladies lounge			2
the piece of history @entity18 says fascinates her is that the current ladies room room was where former president , rep. @entity56 died in february of 1848			1
he collapsed following one of his famous anti slavery speeches in @entity12 , which was then the @entity3 floor			0
" he 'd been president , and he was asked to run for @entity23 specifically to fight against slavery			0
and he was all worn out , as most presidents are , but he was so moved by slavery he came back , " @entity18 said			2
" and for over twenty years , he stood over here , and every single day he stood up with his petition to stop slavery			0
and every day he was booed down and hated , hated , hated by his fellow congressmen			0
until finally at the very end of his life , he stood up again with his petition , and collapsed			0
" she said the couch where @entity56 died is still in the ladies ' restroom			1
" he was laid on a couch that 's still in here - that was the same couch , it 's obviously been redone , and he laid here for three days			0
well now the interesting story is , this was a broom closet that no one knew , but on the wall is a bust of @entity56			2
and it said that he was serving here and he collapsed , he came , and it told the whole story about how he died on this couch while he was in the midst of fighting for slavery			0
that whole story was lost until this room was recovered , " leave it to the women , @entity18 said , to figure it out			1
related : @entity18 's not - so - quiet exit			1
