-- @entity2 chairman @entity1 might be reminding conservative activists of a past @entity2 leadership turned arrogant with power			1
under @entity1 's leadership , the @entity2 has been accused of spending campaign funds on private jets , booze , limousines , five - star hotels , overseas resorts and a party donor 's trip to a @entity16 bondage club			1
most conservatives will agree that these expenditures are a horrible waste of funds at a time when republicans are hoping to enjoy sizable gains in the 2010 midterm elections			1
after the devastating results of the 2006 and 2008 elections , conservatives were unexpectedly able to energize their followers as the @entity30 movement emerged and president @entity31 experienced first - year difficulties			2
local @entity2 victories in gubernatorial elections in @entity35 and @entity36 boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared @entity38 might be on the verge of another @entity40			1
but along comes the @entity2 scandals , which have had the exact opposite effect			1
@entity43 , the president of the @entity44 , told his followers that they should not write checks to the national party			0
@entity43 said : " this latest incident is another indication to me the @entity2 is completely tone - deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people they are seeking financial support from			1
" the @entity2 scandals smack of the type of arrogance that was at the heart of the scandals that brought down key @entity22 in 2005 and 2006			1
during these critical years , it became clear that party leaders had been abusing their influence by focusing on expanding their own power rather than advancing the agenda of the right			2
@entity67 majority leader @entity66 was forced to resign in early 2006 after being accused of violating campaign finance laws in @entity69			0
he was also tied to the lobbying scandals that centered on @entity71			0
@entity73 rep. @entity72 ended his career for accepting bribes from defense contractors who benefited from his decisions on appropriations			0
there was also the case of @entity84 rep. @entity83 , to whom @entity2 leaders turned a blind eye despite his highly inappropriate text messages to underage male pages			2
even @entity88 , the darling of the @entity90 , had been in cahoots with @entity71 in schemes to mobilize activists to protest gaming with the intention of drumming up business for his long - time friend			0
it seemed that the attitude of @entity22 in @entity101 had become " anything goes			2
" the results were devastating			0
many republicans were forced to resign , and @entity38 regained control of @entity106 in 2006			0
polls showed that corruption was a major issue on @entity110			0
the chickens had come home to roost			0
not only did the scandals offer campaign fodder for @entity38 who wanted to challenge the @entity22 ' self - promotion as the righteous party , but even more importantly , they deflated the enthusiasm of conservative activists who believed their energy and money had been wasted and that their party was just as corrupt as the opposition			1
rather than the party of @entity125 , the @entity22 looked more like the party of @entity127			2
the @entity1 scandals point to that same kind of arrogance			1
this time around , @entity22 are in an even weaker position , given that they are in the minority and out of the @entity67 , struggling to rebuild their battered party			2
in addition , @entity38 have just achieved a major victory with health care , and it seems that the jobs market is finally starting to improve			0
republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of @entity101 than in the more modest ways of @entity143			0
on monday , the @entity2 chief of staff resigned , with many assuming he was fired by @entity1 in an effort to clean house			1
the resignation is a start			0
but much more needs to be done			0
if the @entity2 leadership does not respond more aggressively , recent efforts to revive the party wo n't amount to very much			1
conservative voters will not be enthusiastic about supporting a party whose leaders partake in lavish and questionable activities , and @entity38 will have more evidence that their opponents can not be trusted with power			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			2

@entity162 : @entity1 and @entity2 spending spree is *alienating* conservative wing
@entity162 : spending on booze , bondage club comes when @entity22 hoping to win 2010 midterms
he thinks scandals reveal same arrogance that brought down @entity22 in 2005 and 2006
they must change or it appears they ca n't be trusted with power , @entity162 says
