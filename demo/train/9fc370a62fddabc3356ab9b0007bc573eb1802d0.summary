" birdman " had wings			2
" @entity4 " cracked the code			0
" @entity6 " did grand business			0
but not all esteemed films did so well at the @entity9 nominations thursday morning			1
complete list of @entity9 nominations here are 5 things we learned : 1			1
fifty years after the event it portrayed , " @entity17 " is ( again ) a flashpoint the highly praised movie about a key period in the civil - rights movement stars @entity21 as the rev. @entity22 and was directed by relative newcomer @entity23			1
both @entity21 and @entity24 , in particular , had been singled out for acclaim , but when the @entity9 nominations came down , both were shut out			1
" @entity17 " ended up with just two nominations : best picture and best song			1
the @entity34 , noting the lack of diversity among the acting and directing categories , reacted with scorn			1
" @entity17 " had been criticized for the way it portrayed some aspects of history -- particularly the role of president @entity41 -- but as a movie , the reviews were resoundingly favorable , with 99 % approval on @entity45			1
noting that other directing nominees were n't penalized for their movies ' inaccuracies , @entity47 ' @entity46 wrote , " ms. @entity23 , more than her peers , arguably needed that @entity9 validation as a bargaining chip			1
" he added , pointedly , " i 'm angry because one of the best films of the year has been libeled and that said libel apparently worked			0
" but @entity58 , who received a best song nomination for the film , handled the issue gracefully			0
" i believe when people vote , they have their perspectives , they have what they think is right and we have to understand , it 's a vote , " he told @entity2			1
" i just say whatever color we are , keep making quality work and i know it will eventually be recognized			0
the divide between blockbusters and low - budget films grows with the expanded list of best - picture nominees , more box - office hits -- films earning $ 100 million or more domestically -- have made the oscar grade in recent years			1
but of this year 's eight nominees , the highest - grossing film domestically is " @entity6 , " which came out in march , and it 's made just $ 59 million			1
@entity81 : box office duds threaten @entity9 ratings such hits as " @entity85 , " " @entity86 , " " unbroken " and " @entity87 , " all considered awards possibilities , did n't make the @entity90 's shortlist			2
( admittedly , some of the nominees have just been released , so their box office could climb significantly			2
) @entity95 film writer @entity94 , who wrote about the snubs and surprises , is surprised himself that more blockbusters did n't make the list			0
" @entity90 is probably going back and wondering , did we accomplish what we wanted to accomplish by expanding it ? " he says			0
" the fact that there 's no ' @entity85 , ' no ' unbroken , ' no ' interstellar , ' is certainly notable on an @entity90 list that 's meant include films of that type			2
score one for veterans sure , there were some @entity9 newcomers , including @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			0
and though @entity116 and @entity117 are established performers , they 'd never gotten @entity9 nominations			2
but the nods were full of familiar names , some of which surprised observers			0
@entity125 , who at 84 is now the oldest supporting actor nominee ever , received his seventh nod			2
@entity127 now has five nominations			2
@entity129 made it for the third year in a row			0
@entity133 , though not nominated for best director , was recognized through his " @entity134 , " which got six nominations ( including @entity129 's )			1
and @entity137 , as always , is in a class by herself			0
her nomination for playing a witch in " @entity86 " is her 19th overall , extending her own record			0
is it deserved ? that 's a whole different discussion			2
watch out for " @entity145 " -- and " whiplash " " birdman " and " boyhood " have been battling it out all awards season			0
it 'll be no different on @entity9 night : although " birdman " has more nominations , " boyhood " is generally considered the favorite			2
but in a mild surprise , " @entity6 , " which has stayed in the discussion despite being released 10 months ago ( just after the 2014 ceremony , in fact ) , has continued to build steam , including its best comedy / musical win at the @entity159			0
@entity163 finally earned a directing nomination , and the movie has a gravitas that could make it a popular second choice for @entity9 voters , despite its comic tone			0
" @entity179 " almost certainly wo n't win best picture , but the nominations for this @entity173 winner about a hard - driving music teacher and his egocentric student are an achievement on their own given its minuscule budget and limited distribution			1
@entity180 , who 's at work on another musical ( this one with " @entity179 " star @entity183 and @entity184 ) , will be a name to watch , and @entity186 may soon become the most - esteemed @entity187 in history			1
' @entity189 ' falls apart besides the " @entity17 " shocker , perhaps the biggest surprise of the morning was the lack of love for " the @entity194			1
" what could have been two hours of product placement was instead a clever , heartwarming film about the need for affection and togetherness , and it was widely expected to earn a nomination for best animated feature -- and perhaps its screenplay			1
instead it got just one nomination , for its song " @entity207			0
" @entity94 wonders whether the movie was too hip for the room			0
" the feeling has been that a more conservative or stodgy voter would not quite spark to the film , " he says			0
" i think there 's a constituency within the ( animators ' ) branch that maybe felt that this was a little too cutting - edge			1
" " @entity194 " co-director , co-writer and co-producer @entity218 , however , was n't going to be denied			1
he posted a photo of an @entity9 -- made of @entity189 .			0

" @entity17 's " lack of nominations prompts *backlash*
of the eight best picture nominees , none has been a big hit
many had expected " the @entity194 " to get an animated - feature nod
