-- it 's a beautiful afternoon on the beach			1
the sun is shining , you 're rolling in the waves , showing off the toned torso you worked on at the gym all winter			0
suddenly a sharp , burning sensation hits your skin			0
you 've just been stung by a jellyfish			1
if experts ' warnings are true , swimmers around the world can expect to experience these unwanted love taps in greater numbers than ever before			1
" jellyfish and tourism are not happy bedfellows , " says dr. @entity19 , author of the recently published book , " @entity21 ! on @entity25 and the @entity26			1
" @entity19 says popular beach resorts around the world are seeing huge increases in jellyfish " bloom " activity , a result of overfishing and changing water temperatures			1
" the @entity38 and @entity39 rivieras , @entity40 , the @entity41 , @entity42 ... some of the numbers are staggering , " says the @entity35 scientist who 's now based in @entity36			1
" in @entity42 there have been times that 800 or 1,000 people have been stung in a day			0
in @entity39 or @entity49 , it 's not uncommon in recent years for a half a million people to be stung during an outbreak			1
these numbers are simply astonishing			0
" at the beginning of october , a large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling - water intake at a @entity57 nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor			1
jellyfish prompt nuclear shutdown in @entity64 , a jellyfish bloom reportedly killed thousands of farmed salmon , according to the @entity66			2
this past summer , southern @entity67 experienced one of its worst jellyfish infestations ever			2
experts there have been reporting a steady increase in the number of jellyfish in the @entity75 for years			2
according to a report titled " @entity78 in the @entity75 and @entity79 , " written by @entity80 for the @entity81 for the @entity75 and the @entity82 , scientists are catching up to what travelers in the @entity75 have been experiencing for years			2
" in the last decade ... the media are reporting on an increasingly high number of gelatinous plankton blooms , " reads the report			0
" the reason for these reports is that thousands of tourists are stung , fisheries are harmed and even impaired by jellyfish			2
" although noting that significant jellyfish blooms " have been known since ancient times and are part of the normal functioning of the oceans , " the report cites global warming and global overfishing ( which removes jellyfish predators ) as causes for exploding jellyfish populations in recent years			1
the situation in the @entity75 was dire enough to prompt @entity107 's foreign office to issue a warning to its citizens vacationing along @entity67 's southern coast to watch out for jellyfish			1
the world 's deadliest jellyfish there are more than 2,000 species of jellyfish swimming through the world 's waters			1
most stings are completely harmless			0
some will leave you in excruciating pain			0
then there are the killers			0
many of the world 's deadliest jellyfish are box jellyfish , which refers to the species ' cube - shaped meduae			1
" there are several species of big box jellyfish that have caused many deaths -- these include chironex fleckeri in @entity36 , chironex quadrigatus in @entity136 and related species in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , " says associate professor @entity129 , a venom biologist at @entity36 's @entity130			1
also known as the sea wasp and the northern @entity36 box jellyfish , the chironex fleckeri is possibly the worlds most venomous animal			1
its tentacles can reach lengths of up to three meters long , while its bell is about the size of a human head			0
it can be found throughout the tropical waters of the @entity154			0
a close cousin and fellow contender for the " world 's most venomous " cup is the @entity159 , which is the size of a thimble			1
good luck scanning the waters for that one before you leap in			0
" how toxic they are is just phenomenally frightening and equally fascinating , " says @entity19			0
" just the lightest brush -- you do n't even feel it -- and then , whammo , you 're in more pain than you ever could have imagined , and you are struggling to breathe and you ca n't move your limbs and you ca n't stop vomiting and your blood pressure just keeps going up and up			2
" it is really surprising how many places they occur around the world -- places you would never expect : @entity42 , @entity175 , @entity49 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity138 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 ... as well as @entity36			2
" @entity182 giant hornets and other terrifying creatures is any place safe ? " more and more , places around the world that are suffering from jellyfish problems with tourists are developing prediction systems so that tourists can know when it is safe , " says @entity19			1
the irony , she says , is that tourists who avoid an area because of the known risk may alter their plans to hit a " safe " beach whose officials are merely less up front about the jellyfish situation , putting themselves more at risk			2
a common misconception is that places such as @entity140 , @entity138 , @entity178 and the @entity179 are free of dangerous jellyfish			2
" jellyfish occur in all marine waters from pole to pole and at all depths , " says @entity19			2
" the life threatening ones are found from about 40 degrees north to 40 degrees south latitude			0
" @entity36 is upfront about its jellyfish dangers , and also assertive in safety management , whereas other places have them , but may understand less about them or , in some cases , just do n't want to say			1
i think tourists need to be very aware of local hazards and not expect to necessarily be provided with information			0
" what to do when you 're stung thanks to that infamous " friends " episode that aired in 1997 , millions of people think it 's smart to treat a jellyfish sting with urine			1
in reality , peeing on a jellyfish sting is n't a good idea			1
a report in the @entity235 says urine can actually aggravate the jellyfish 's stingers into releasing more venom			1
meanwhile , there 's debate over what actually works on a jellyfish sting			1
many doctors say it all depends on whether the sting occurs place in tropical or nontropical waters			2
if stung in tropical waters , one should rinse the area with vinegar to deactivate any nematocysts -- the parts of the stinger -- that are still hanging on			0
" a freshwater rinse will have the opposite effect , " says the @entity235 report			0
" any change to the balance of solutes , such as the concentration of salts inside and outside of the cnidocyte [ a venomous cell ] , sets off stinging			0
" in @entity265 , doctors recommend using hot water and topical pain killers on a sting			1
can we turn this around ? @entity19 says the explosion in jellyfish populations is a visible indicator that life in the oceans is out of balance			2
" if we somehow managed to eradicate all jellyfish , then something else -- some other weedy thing -- would find a perfect situation , " she says			0
" so the reason we should care is because they act as a flashing red light			0
" she says there 's no one single factor to blame for the rise in jellyfish populations , but rather places blame on a combination of overfishing , warming water , low oxygen and pollution			1
by fishing out jellyfish predators and competitors , humans are creating perfect conditions for jellyfish to multiply			0
" sadly , i am one of a growing chorus of people who believe that , yes , it is too late to turn things around , " says @entity19			0
" so many species are in such low numbers , and habitats are so badly damaged , that restoring them to their original splendor is simply no longer possible			0
" i believe that our only option now is to decide how much we value what we currently have , and to decide what we are willing to do to maintain it -- or at least slow down its disappearance			0
but honestly , can you really see all 7 billion of us agreeing on that ? "			0

scientists say jellyfish are *proliferating* faster than ever before
changing water temperatures and overfishing are behind the surge in population
@entity159 , box jellyfish among the world 's most deadly varieties
contrary to popular belief , treating a jellyfish sting with urine is n't *advised*
