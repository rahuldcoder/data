folk singer @entity0 , who died monday at 72 , was the opening act in 1969 at @entity2 , the historic counterculture music festival , catapulting him to fame and securing his status as an icon of the baby - boomer generation			1
@entity0 would tour widely for the next 40 years and release more than 20 albums			1
on the 40th anniversary of the @entity2 , @entity0 wrote this reflection for @entity13 in 2009			1
forty years ago this summer i wound up opening the @entity2 when the four acts scheduled before me were stuck in massive traffic jams and delayed in getting to the concert site in @entity18 , @entity19			1
my band had made it up from @entity22 in the early morning hours , and we had the least amount of gear to set up , so after some strong convincing from the promoters i agreed to go on			1
the show was late in starting , and they were feeling pressure to start the music			2
we played for nearly three hours as they were still building the stage around me			2
i sang every song i knew , and when they asked me to go back on one more time , i improvised " freedom			2
" when you see me in the movie tuning my guitar and strumming , i was actually trying to figure out what else i could possibly play ! i looked out at all of those faces in front of me and the word " freedom " came to mind			2
one of my strongest memories of that day is flying in the helicopter over that vast , spectacular crowd that had already stretched back over the hills and well out of view of the stage			2
looking down , my only thought was , " this is incredible			0
... we 're really here and they ca n't hide us anymore			0
" i 've been asked all summer long if i believe @entity2 is still significant and if i think another @entity2 is ever likely to happen			1
well , certainly large three - day festivals are still happening all over : @entity58 and @entity59 in the @entity60 , the @entity61 and @entity62 abroad , but the reality of what made @entity2 become such a historic event has definitely changed			1
@entity2 happened in august 1969 , long before the @entity66 and mobile phones made it possible to communicate instantly with anyone , anywhere			1
it was a time when we were n't able to witness world events or the horrors of war live on 24 - hour news channels			0
news coverage was filtered and selective , and we felt manipulated and silenced by the lack of information			0
so much was happening around us , and we did n't feel like we were being told the truth			0
with everything that was going on in the late 1960s -- the war in @entity83 , civil and human rights issues , the rev. @entity86 's assassination -- we rallied and relied on strength in numbers			0
we came together communally to be heard and to be acknowledged			0
though it 's frequently portrayed as this crazy , unbridled festival of rain - soaked , stoned hippies dancing in the mud , @entity2 was obviously much more than that -- or we would n't still be talking about it in 2009			1
people of all ages and colors came together in the fields of @entity98 's farm			0
some traveled for days or weeks to get there			0
the world was quickly changing , and none of us was willing to sit and just watch it go by			0
we needed to feel like part of the change and that spontaneous coming together felt like the world 's biggest family reunion ! when @entity112 said , " what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000 , " that 's what it felt like : hundreds of thousands of friends and loved ones taking care of one another			0
@entity2 was both a peaceful protest and a global celebration .			1
