-- @entity1 recorded a double triumph on tuesday to book his place in the last eight at @entity5 , over opponent @entity6 and the dismal weather in @entity8			1
after a day punctuated by rain delays on monday , @entity1 was able to wrap up a 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 3 victory with just one interruption before damp conditions halted the action on all but @entity14			1
@entity1 will now face @entity16 's @entity15 -- who knocked him out of the recent @entity17 -- after the @entity18 defeated @entity19 , from @entity20 , 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 3			1
@entity21 no. 1 @entity1 said he was relieved to finish his clash against @entity23 after a frustrating monday in which play was suspended with the score 7 - 5 3 - 1			1
there was criticism of the tournament 's organizers after @entity1 's match was n't switched to @entity14 , which has a retractable roof , but he told reporters : " i honestly do n't care which court i play on			1
" it makes no difference but obviously every player would rather be on @entity14 because you know you are going to get your match in regardless of the weather			1
" i do n't think i deserve to play every match on @entity14			2
it 's just annoying when the weather is bad			2
" i have n't always dealt with rain delays that well in the past , so it 's good experience for me			2
probably from now on i will play on @entity47 so it wo n't be a problem			0
" @entity15 , the no. 7 seed , breezed through his match on the sheltered showpiece court , defeating 2009 @entity53 champion @entity19 in just under two hours			1
he told the @entity55 's official website : " today was one of my best matches [ on a grass ] court			0
but i 'm not sure if is my best or not			0
at @entity5 , there is a lot of wind			2
" on an indoor court , under a roof , it is easier for us to play			0
the ball does not move and this is more comfortable for us			0
" @entity1 and @entity15 were joined in the quarters by @entity70 pair @entity69 and @entity71			1
@entity71 , the no. 31 seed , reached the last eight at @entity5 for only the second time after he defeated @entity75 @entity74 6 - 3 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 2			1
his reward for reaching his first quarterfinal in eight years is a tie with world @entity1 and defending champion @entity80			2
" it 's an unbelievable feeling			0
eight years ago i was here in the quarters , and now eight years later it 's happened again			0
so it 's a wonderful dream for me , " @entity71 told reporters			2
@entity69 battled past @entity89 qualifier @entity87 6 - 1 7 - 6 6 - 3 to make the last eight of a @entity92 tournament for the first time in 33 attempts			1
the no. 27 seed will now play @entity75 no. 5 seed @entity96 after he recorded a 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 win over @entity89 @entity99 in another rain - hit match			1
" i 'm very , very happy , " said @entity69			2
" it 's very tough to describe the real feelings			0
i 'm very happy how i played			0
" also , lucky , at the end , with the weather , that i could finish my match			0
it 's just an amazing feeling			0
for sure i will celebrate			0
i have a lot of confidence now			0
