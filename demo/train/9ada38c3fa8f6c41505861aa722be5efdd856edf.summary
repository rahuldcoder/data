-- on saturday and sunday in @entity2 , there were seven earthquakes			1
the most severe temblor registered 4.3 near @entity8 , the @entity10 site showed , delivering a rumble to @entity12 , north of @entity13 , according to the @entity10			1
there were no reports of damage or major injury on saturday , @entity13 news station @entity14 reported			1
the three earthquakes that happened sunday occurred near @entity8 , @entity0 affiliate @entity20 reported , one registering 4.0			2
the station is covering sunday 's temblors as a developing story			1
track the @entity10 's earthquake report list damage and injury are far more likely with quakes that register 4.0 and higher , the @entity10 reports			1
the temblors seem to be part of a trend in the state			1
as of last month , @entity2 had surpassed @entity32 in the number of earthquakes			2
from 1978 to 2008 , @entity2 was hit with an average of just two quakes of 3.0 magnitude of greater			1
as of june 19 , 2014 , there were 207 such quakes recorded in the state , the @entity10 said			2
an increase began in 2009 when 20 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher occurred , followed by 43 the next year and increasing every year except for 2012			2
as of june 16 , 2014 , @entity32 had recorded about 140 quakes of 3.0 - magnitude or greater , compared with @entity2 's 207			1
" earthquakes are going to be a normal part of everyday life in @entity2 , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity46 said			1
" they are going to become more and more a part of life there			0
" @entity2 out - quakes @entity32 in 2014 the four quakes that struck saturday were relatively shallow , happening 5 miles or less from the surface , @entity46 notes			1
larger earthquakes , such as the ones that happen in @entity32 , generally go much deeper , sometimes 50 miles deep			0
the @entity2 quakes were strong enough to knock dishes off shelves and cause cracks in foundations but not enough to knock down buildings , @entity46 said			2
the @entity64 said it had stepped up the number of monitoring stations in the state , operating a network of 15 permanent stations and 17 temporary stations			0
along with the @entity10 , the state geographical survey is researching to determine why earthquakes are happening more frequently			2
it 's possible that hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , could have played a role in causing temblors , but there 's no way to be sure until the @entity10 files its findings , @entity46 said			1
it does that once a month			0
fracking is controversial and has split public opinion			0
@entity0 explored the process in - depth in an august 2013 special			0
in short , fracking works like this : a well is typically drilled between 5,000 to 20,000 feet into the earth 's crust , then turns 90 degrees and continues horizontally for several thousand feet to where shale containing natural gas is believed to be			0
a mix of water , sand and chemicals is pumped at high pressure into the well to create long , narrow cracks or openings in the earth through which gas can escape			0
the sand particles keep the fissures open , allowing for natural gas to escape from the shale and flow into the well			0
the gas , along with the waste water , is drawn back up the well to the surface , where it is processed , refined and shipped			0
wastewater injection could be behind the increase in the number of quakes recorded in @entity2 , @entity10 geophysicist @entity113 told @entity0			1
could a larger earthquake happen in the state ? " given the rate of earthquakes over the last six months , " @entity113 said , " it 's concerning enough to be worried about a larger , damaging earthquake happening			0
" what to know about earthquakes measuring the magnitude of earthquakes @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report .			0

the largest quake registered a magnitude of 4.3 , according to the @entity10
the temblors appear to be part of a trend of increasing earthquakes in @entity2
