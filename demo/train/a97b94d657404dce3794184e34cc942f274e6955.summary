multiple sources close to @entity1 say the former @entity5 governor 's recent public appearances in which , he seems to be thinking out loud about a possible presidential run are actually very similar to the private discussions he is having with friends and colleagues			1
" the public conversation is what he has been saying to us			2
he is honestly struggling with this decision , " says a source familiar with the process , who argues it is " real , " unlike some other @entity19 contenders who have decided to run , but wo n't say so			0
" he 's doing this in a thoughtful way , and he has n't made up his mind			0
" and while @entity1 , as a potential presidential candidate , if often critiqued as someone out of touch with his own party , another source claims that consideration is not a part of the @entity1 equation			1
" he does n't worry about whether he 's in tune with his party , " this source says			0
" he knows what he believes			0
" indeed , adds another source , " he would fully expect and welcome a fight			2
" in fact , in his recent appearance before a @entity43 ceo @entity41 event , @entity1 mused that the @entity19 nominee needs to be willing to " lose the primary to win the general ( election ) without violating your principles			1
" that 's a not - so - veiled reference to what many believe occurred in @entity54 's 2012 campaign , and recognition of @entity1 's own problems with the base of his party , which has balked at his stands on both immigration reform and the common core education standards for schools			1
sources also say that while @entity1 has said he will decide in " short order " — perhaps sometime early in the @entity64 — a decision will likely not come in a major announcement			1
instead , one source says , " he could send some signals			0
" in campaign parlance , that could mean the hiring of staff , forming an exploratory committee or formally soliciting money			0
or simply say he 's leaning towards a run or against it			0
while top @entity1 advisers have been gathering data on what a run would entail , no commitments have been made or asked of potential staff or supporters , one source says			1
rather , the conversations have been " if he decides to run would you talk further with us , " this source says			0
on the personal side , @entity1 's concerns seem twofold according to multiple sources			1
first , as one puts it " how can i best protect my family ? " in the @entity43 forum , @entity1 himself put it this way : " can i do it where the sacrifice for my family is tolerable ... it 's a pretty ugly business right now , " he said			1
" there 's a level under which i would never subjugate my family because that 's my organizing principle			2
i think people kind of appreciate that			0
so , i 'm sorting that out			0
" second , another source adds , @entity1 is concerned , as he has said previously , that a campaign ought to be " joyful and full of value			1
" translation : @entity1 needs to make sure he is willing to campaign daily for two years because of his love for country , party and commitment to the his issue set — immigration and education reform , tax changes , energy policy , regulatory policy			1
it 's also clear that @entity1 is weighing the strain of daily campaign in a 24/7 media cycle in which everything he says will be relentlessly scrutinized			1
in his appearance before the @entity43 conference , he made several telling asides about being " fact - checked " as if to underscore the media spotlight — and fishbowl life — that accompanies a presidential candidacy			0
what @entity1 is clearly not shying away from is any engagement on the issues			2
at the @entity43 forum , @entity1 said congressional republicans need to lead without grandstanding			2
" we do n't have to make a point any more as @entity19 , " @entity1 told the ceo - filled audience			2
" ... we have to actually show that we can , in an adult - like way , we can govern , lead			0
