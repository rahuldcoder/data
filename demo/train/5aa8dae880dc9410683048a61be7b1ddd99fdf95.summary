-- @entity2 foreign ministers have approved @entity4 's request for @entity6 missiles to defend its borders , a statement of " solidarity " with its fellow alliance member			2
" today @entity2 agreed to augment @entity4 's air defense by deploying @entity6 missiles to @entity4			2
@entity4 has asked for @entity2 's support and we stand with @entity4 in the spirit of strong solidarity , " said @entity2 secretary - general @entity12			0
" to @entity4 people we say , we are determined to defend you and your territory			0
to anyone who would want to attack @entity4 , we say , do n't even think about it			0
" the move is in response to the spilling over of the @entity26 civil war into @entity4 , where errant @entity26 artillery shells struck the border town of @entity29 and killed five @entity4 civilians in october			1
@entity4 asked @entity2 to deploy @entity6 missiles along its border to bolster its air defenses against @entity26 threats			1
@entity26 family hides from attacks in underground ' prison ' the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , which all have @entity6 capabilities , have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles			1
@entity12 believes the " actual deployment will take place within weeks			0
" " we welcome the intention of @entity38 , the @entity39 and the @entity37 to provide @entity6 missile batteries , subject to their respective national procedures			1
these systems will be under the operational command of the supreme allied commander @entity50			0
any deployment will be defensive only			0
it will in no way support a no - fly zone or any offensive operation , " @entity12 said			0
the decision was made as news surfaced about fears of @entity61 's government using chemical weapons			1
@entity12 echoed warnings from @entity37 president @entity64 that the @entity26 government may be toying with the idea of using chemical weapons to crush the 21 - month rebellion			1
" the @entity26 stockpiles of chemical weapons are a matter of great concern , " @entity12 told reporters			1
" we know that @entity26 possesses missiles			1
we know they have chemical weapons and , of course , they also have to be included in our calculations			1
and this is also the reason why it is a matter of urgency to ensure effective defense and protection of our ally @entity4 , " he said			0
opinion : rape is shredding @entity26 's social fabric " let me add to this that the possible use of chemical weapons would be completely unacceptable for the whole international community , and if anybody resorts to these terrible weapons i would expect an immediate reaction from the international community			1
" violence raged tuesday in @entity26 , with at least 155 people killed across the country , the opposition @entity99 said			1
in one key development , rebel fighters scored a major gain where government forces once ruled			2
the rebels have cut off a sprawling military base outside @entity109 with some 450 government soldiers trapped inside			0
the rebels could easily overrun the base , fighter @entity112 said , but they want to give government soldiers a chance to defect			0
already , about 250 soldiers have defected from units at the base since the @entity26 uprising began in 2011 , and most of them have joined the opposition			1
it 's another indication @entity61 is losing his grip on a country he once firmly commanded			0
as fighting subsides , @entity109 residents find little left the government has tried air - dropping food to its soldiers , often missing the targets			0
opposition fighters have shot out their water supply			0
while the soldiers still have stockpiles of artillery , their options are dwindling			0
" they have reached a point where they think that they ca n't go back , " said @entity137 , a defector			0
" they have reached a dead end			2
slowly , they are weakening			0
" in another incident , rebels and the government are reporting deadly shelling on a school in a refugee camp in the @entity152 area			1
the @entity99 said 30 students were killed there			1
@entity155 , a spokeswoman for the opposition in @entity152 , said the school was " showered by mortars leaving between eight and 12 dead , including children and a teacher			1
" " i can not say if this area was state loyal , " she said , adding it was very remote and inhabited by refugees from the @entity162 whose kin had suffered from government shelling in the south of the capital			2
" we have not reached a concrete conclusion at this point " about who fired the shells , @entity155 added			0
@entity26 refugees face brutal winter with inadequate shelter and food @entity12 stressed that a patriot missile deployment will be " purely defensive " and that @entity2 has " no intention to prepare offensive operations			1
" the deployment would be an " effective deterrent " and de-escalate tensions along the border , he said			0
such a deployment would compel " any potential aggressor to think twice before they even consider attacking @entity4			0
" a @entity190 official , speaking with @entity0 on background , claimed the @entity6 systems are more symbolic than militarily necessary			2
@entity190 has been a friend of the @entity26 government over the years and has blocked tough action against the @entity61 government in the @entity196			1
echoing comments by @entity190 president @entity199 , the official said @entity26 has no interest in attacking @entity4			1
concern over the issue has rippled across the world			0
@entity205 foreign minister @entity204 said before @entity2 moved on the issue that deploying @entity6 missiles is a " good decision			0
" he noted " many attacks by @entity26 against @entity4 borders			1
" " @entity4 has asked for protection , " he said			0
" we are deciding to grant this protection through @entity6 missiles			0
" as for the chemical weapons issue , the @entity26 @entity215 denied that the country has any plans to use such arms , state tv reported			1
the government has also repeatedly stressed it will not use such weapons , if they exist , against its people under any circumstances			2
but @entity37 officials say " worrying signs " suggest otherwise			2
@entity26 forces have started combining chemicals that could be used to make deadly sarin gas for weapons to attack rebel and civilian populations , one @entity37 official said			1
the intelligence , obtained over the weekend , the official said , came from multiple sources			2
but the official declined to provide more details about how the @entity37 learned of it			1
sarin gas , the source said , could most readily be used to fill artillery shells			0
@entity64 said monday that " the use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable			2
and if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons , there will be consequences , and you will be held accountable			2
" @entity250 prime minister @entity249 said that @entity250 and the world community are " closely monitoring the developments in @entity26 regarding the stockpiles of chemical weapons			1
" " i heard the important things president @entity64 said on this matter , we are of a single mind			0
it is forbidden to use these weapons and it should be forbidden to pass them on to terror elements , " he said			2
@entity37 concerned @entity26 ' cooking up recipes ' for chemical weapons @entity0 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , and @entity272 , along with journalist @entity266 , contributed to this report .			1
