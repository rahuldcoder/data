-- @entity1 has already denied @entity2 his first grand slam title once , and the world @entity4 will again stand in the @entity8 gold medalist 's way in monday 's @entity10 final			1
@entity1 kept his title defense alive with a commanding performance against @entity13 on sunday , rebounding after dropping his first set of the tournament to win their delayed semifinal 2 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
the @entity18 had struggled in saturday 's strong winds and trailed 5 - 2 when play was halted , but he was unstoppable in more benign conditions as he reached the final for the third year in a row			2
" it 's a huge relief to get through this match			0
@entity13 's a great competitor , he 's one of the fittest guys on tour and he never gives up , " @entity1 told reporters after a match lasting two and a half hours -- 90 minutes less than @entity2 's win over @entity30 on saturday			1
" we were all praying for less wind today			0
he handled the wind much better than i did but i came in today as a different player and i 'm just really happy to get to another grand slam final			1
" @entity10 latest scores @entity1 lost his first grand slam final at the 2007 @entity10 but was able to quickly bounce back with his breakthrough win in @entity40 just months later			1
@entity2 , however , lost the 2008 @entity42 final , in @entity43 in 2010 and 2011 -- the first of those against @entity1 -- and then at @entity46 this year			1
however , he beat @entity1 and @entity47 on the way to victory at @entity50 and is now seeking to end a run that has seen that duo and @entity53 win 29 of the past 30 majors			0
" i do n't think there is any clear favorite , " said @entity1 , who has an 8 - 5 edge over @entity2 in their career meetings			2
" he 's looking for his first title , i 'm sure he 's going to be very motivated			0
i hope we can come up with the best tennis for this crowd			0
" @entity2 has the backing of high - profile fellow @entity66 @entity65 and @entity68			0
" that 's the first time i 've met sir @entity68 and first time i met sir @entity65 , as well , " @entity2 said after the @entity70 actor and @entity72 football manager gatecrashed his post-match press conference on saturday			0
" so that 's obviously nice to have their support			0
hopefully they 'll be back for the final , as well			0
" @entity13 is still waiting to play in his first grand slam final after 40 attempts			1
the @entity84 fourth seed , who also reached the semis at @entity87 in 2007 , served out for the first set on sunday but then lost five games in a row			0
@entity1 won the first four games of the fourth set against the @entity94 semifinalist as he won through to his ninth grand slam final			1
the 25 - year - old will be looking to cap a season in which he won the opening major but then failed to become the first player since @entity100 in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles when he lost to @entity53 in the @entity94 final			1
@entity1 then surrendered his no. 1 ranking when he lost in the semifinals at @entity46 and @entity47 won a seventh title on the hallowed grass courts of the @entity107 to match @entity109 ' open era record and afterwards surpass the @entity111 's landmark number of 286 weeks at the top of the rankings			2
@entity1 can not return to no. 1 even if he retains his title , despite @entity47 's quarterfinal exit against @entity30 -- his earliest at the hard - court tournament since 2004			2
he will be looking for revenge against @entity2 after failing to win a medal at @entity50 , losing to @entity119 in the bronze playoff , and is in strong form on his favored surface after last month winning the @entity124 title and reaching the final in @entity126 .			2

second seed @entity1 wins through to @entity10 final for third year in a row
@entity18 will continue his title defense against world no. 4 @entity2 on monday
he bounces back from dropping his first set of the tournament in @entity42
@entity1 ends hopes of @entity13 , still seeking to reach his first grand slam final
