-- rights groups are warning of a backlash against activists in @entity4 following a landmark @entity6 resolution calling for an international inquiry into abuses at the end of the country 's civil war			1
the @entity6 's @entity13 passed a resolution thursday calling for a " comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights " allegedly committed both by @entity4 government forces and the separatist @entity20 in the final stages of the country 's brutal 26 - year civil war			1
the resolution -- the @entity13 's third directed at @entity4 in recent years , but the first explicitly calling for an independent probe -- tasked the @entity6 's @entity27 with conducting the investigation			1
sponsored by countries including the @entity29 and @entity30 , the resolution was supported by 23 members of the 47 - member @entity13 , with 12 opposed and 12 abstentions			0
in comments on a government website , @entity4 's president @entity35 said his government rejected the resolution , saying it did not help efforts at national reconciliation			2
the government would press ahead with its own healing process by pursuing recommendations made by its lessons learned and @entity47 , he said			0
a bloody end the @entity4 civil war ended in may 2009 with the crushing defeat of the @entity20 in their heartland in the north of the island			1
according to a report by a panel appointed by @entity57 ban ki - moon , government troops were responsible for abuses including the intentional shelling of civilians , summary executions , rape , and blocking food and medicine from reaching affected communities			0
one report estimates up to 40,000 @entity68 civilians may have been killed in the war 's final stages			2
the @entity20 similarly stand accused of abuses , including using child soldiers , deploying civilians as human shields , and killing those who tried to escape			0
the @entity13 resolution also expresses " serious concern " at conditions that rights organizations claim persist in @entity4 -- including the intimidation of activists , disappearances and torture			0
@entity4 's government has consistently denied the allegations against it , and claims it faces a renewed threat of @entity68 separatists regrouping in the country 's north			1
this week , it banned the @entity68 government - in - exile and 15 other @entity68 groups operating in the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , accusing them of committing and supporting terrorism			1
@entity96 's representative to the @entity6 in @entity97 , @entity95 , told @entity0 that the move would add to a climate that made it difficult for @entity102 staff , journalists and others interacting with @entity68 groups , as it could render them vulnerable to anti-terror laws			1
" the consequences of that is that anyone dealing with those organizations will be subject to accusations of cooperating with terrorism --- that brings them within the parameters of a rather draconian piece of legislation , the @entity119 , " he said			0
' culture of impunity ' rights groups have welcomed the @entity6 resolution , with @entity124 , @entity125 deputy director at @entity96 , saying it brought " new hope for the thousands of victims of abuses in @entity4 , " and presented the country 's government with the opportunity " to restore some international credibility by cooperating with the investigation			1
" but they say that @entity4 appeared to be responding to the increased international scrutiny by demonstrating a renewed determination to crack down on dissent			2
@entity138 of the @entity30 - based @entity139 said the recent arrests of prominent human rights activists @entity142 and rev. @entity143 under anti-terror laws highlighted the " culture of impunity " in which the government was operating			2
shortly after @entity142 was released after more than two days of detention last month , he told @entity0 he believed his arrest was part of " a deliberate attempt to intimidate and suppress any form of dissent , criticism or challenge , and clearly not allow people outside @entity4 to know what 's happening inside the country			0
" @entity142 , who @entity138 said had since been instructed by the government not to speak with media , said the security personnel questioning him seemed interested in whether he was sharing information with people behind the @entity6 resolution in @entity97			0
@entity95 said the crackdown on activists and civil society figures appeared calculated to send a message to potential witnesses not to cooperate with the @entity6 inquiry , which was scheduled to deliver an oral report to the @entity13 in september , and a written report in march			0
he said @entity4 's refusal to cooperate with the probe would likely not prove an issue , as similar commissions of inquiry into abuses in @entity179 and @entity180 had progressed without the involvement of those governments			1
a crucial consideration , though , would be safeguarding the protection of witnesses , as even those in the diaspora would likely have family members remaining in @entity4 who could be vulnerable to potential retribution , he said			0
