@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 oil disaster			0
the collapse of a highway overpass during rush hour			0
all of these calamities have happened in the @entity11 in recent years			0
and today , graduate students at the @entity13 are analyzing these disasters to learn how they can prepare for the next one -- or help prevent it			1
they are all working toward a master of science in security technology			1
it 's sort of like a degree in all things @entity22			2
the new graduate program , which began last month , has attracted students from a variety of backgrounds			1
students attending the inaugural class include a @entity29 , a government it guy , even a @entity11 postal worker			2
they are studying high profile catastrophes from natural disasters like hurricanes and pandemic diseases to critical infrastructure failures and biological or explosive terrorist attacks			1
they also examine collapses in the banking industry , the postal service , electric power grids and food supply chains			0
the program is taught by @entity45 , a leading security expert and the director of the university 's @entity47			1
after the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , @entity45 was tasked with assessing the security risk to the nation 's electrical power grid			1
he and his team reported their findings to the @entity11 government			2
@entity45 said his passion for improving people 's lives through technology began as a young boy in @entity61			1
" i went with my dad to villages to practice medicine ... where women would die in childbirth , " @entity45 said			2
" and i would see that as soon as they got electricity , their lives would improve			0
" because of this experience , i kind of knew at that young age ... i wanted to use physics to improve the lives of others			0
" three years ago , he got a close - up view of how physics can impact people 's lives			2
sitting in his office , he watched as the @entity82 west bridge that crosses the @entity83 in @entity0 collapsed just a few yards away , killing 13 people			0
@entity45 said that tragedy helped spark the idea for the master 's program			1
" all these large scale critical systems that we take for granted ... how do we prevent systemic failure in them , " he said			0
" if a disturbance occurs in one place , how do we identify precursors to disturbances before [ disaster ] happens ? " the biggest challenge his students face is coming up with a solution to preventing disasters without hindering civil liberties and privacy , @entity45 said			1
a large number of the students enrolled in the program are working professionals from industries where security and risk assessment play an important role			1
@entity113 , an information technology analyst for @entity1 's @entity115 caucus , said security plays a " pretty big part " of his job			1
" what we do here is political , so there 's obviously a lot of need for secrecy and privacy , " @entity113 said			2
" we 're very cognizant of security issues			2
" @entity113 said he has been looking for a way to combine his interest in cryptology and code - breaking with his passion for public policy			0
" working for the @entity22 or continuing to work for the legislature in terms of setting broad security policies for the state or country ... that would probably be my dream job , " he said			0
student @entity140 already has first - hand experience with securing critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks			1
" during the initial invasion of @entity145 , part of my job was to go around and evaluate locations throughout the central command area of operations , look at facilities and make sure they were not vulnerable to attack by terrorists , " he said			0
after earning his graduate degree , the @entity29 reserve officer hopes to one day become the chief technology officer of a computer networking company , focusing on cyber threats			0
that may not sound like a job that could prevent the next terrorist attack			0
but @entity45 says learning about past disasters can help anyone in any position be better prepared for the next one : " at the risk of being grandiose , we can help save the world			1
" @entity2 's @entity169 contributed to this report			0

@entity13 offers master 's program in security technology
program teaches students how to prepare for natural disasters and terrorist attacks
many students are professionals , including *military* and government workers
program is the *brainchild* of @entity45 , an @entity61 - born security expert
