-- @entity3 's " in @entity10 " is the winner of this year 's " @entity6 " competition and while it gets points for an excellent premise , some fine acting and for being , occasionally , genuinely exciting , the execution of the idea fails far more often than it succeeds			2
" in @entity10 " is set in some future time / alternate reality @entity12 ( the locations are referred to as @entity14 and @entity15 but it 's all too obviously @entity12 ) where humans cease aging at 25 with only an additional one year on their internal clocks , displayed as a sub-dermal , glowing digital countdown on their forearms			1
everyone in the film is young and ( mostly ) beautiful and aside from running out of time , people can only die by acts of violence , random or otherwise -- disease is apparently nonexistent			1
but more time can be earned ( or stolen ) so those who are wealthy live , while those who are poor die			1
as a result , the poor take risks because they have nothing to lose , while the rich play it very safe , some refusing to take even minuscule physical risks like swimming in the ocean			2
the poor , those short on time , live in @entity14 ( downtown @entity12 , near the river ) and if they have jobs at all , they live literally day - to - day , hoping that they can get enough work to purchase another day on their clocks			1
those without jobs resort to begging or " fighting , " a sort of arm - wrestling for time			1
many work in a factory that makes time storage devices that can be used to move time around from place to place or person to person , like a wallet with money in it			1
as with most films set in a poor neighborhood , the denizens of @entity14 have dreams			2
in general , to have enough time so that they can live a decent life without having to wake up every day thinking it 's their last			1
they are literally slaves to time , forced to either beg , steal or work at sub-standard wages simply in order to live			1
while this set - up should give ample opportunity for visual and emotional shock , @entity14 is spectacularly clean and well organized for what 's essentially a factory slum			2
the only indication that the locals are in any peril at all is the ( very ) occasional shot of a dead " timed out " body on the street			2
you 'd think it would happen more often			2
@entity95 plays @entity96 , a factory worker whose personal dream is to be able to celebrate his mother 's birthday in the rich playground of @entity15 ( which looks very much like @entity101 and @entity102 ) and early on , it looks like he might have achieved that dream when he suddenly finds himself with over a century of time			1
in a local bar , @entity96 rescues @entity106 , a suspiciously well - dressed stranger ( " @entity108 " star @entity107 ) from a group of time thieves called @entity111 , who " clean the clocks " of their victims			1
however , it turns out that the rescued man was trying to die			2
he 's 105 and has simply grown tired of living			2
having been thwarted in his initial attempt at suicide , @entity106 gives will all but a few minutes of his life while the latter man is asleep , leaving him the message " do n't waste my time , " hoping that @entity96 will do something worthy with his new found riches			1
@entity126 and behold , before @entity96 is able to enjoy his windfall a personal tragedy sets him on his path towards addressing the injustices of the world , by single - handedly ( at first ) destroying the " monetary " system			1
if it were only that easy , eh ? after arriving in @entity15 , he quickly attracts the attention of not only one of the richest men around ( @entity137 , played by a perfectly smug @entity138 ) but also that of his daughter , @entity140 ( @entity141 )			0
coming from the " wrong side of the tracks , " @entity96 proves to be an oddity among the swells , as he knows how to live and take risks , like swimming in the ocean or driving a car really fast on the empty @entity149			1
while the setting of the film is ostensibly in the future , everyone is driving vintage @entity154 and @entity155 ( although they do have the whine of electric vehicles ) and people use pay phones			0
while of course it 's perfectly ok for a future vision to have seemingly anachronistic touches , these play like prosaic failures of imagination			0
if you 're going to ground a science fiction story in such mundane realities , at least give a reason why			0
@entity95 continues to prove that his prolonged hiatus from music is a well thought out decision			1
for all the success his recording career brought him , it 's entirely possible that he has a brighter career as an actor			0
he is as capable here at action adventure as he was at broad comedy in " @entity182			0
" i could easily see him in a musical or a straight drama			0
@entity141 , her doe - eyes framed with a cute bob a la @entity189 or even more apropos , @entity190 in " @entity191 , " does her level best with what she 's given , but her " rich girl with a rebellious streak " is n't as well - developed a character as it could be.it 's never really clear if @entity140 's transition from slightly rebellious rich girl to full - on criminal is due to her belief in @entity96 ' @entity202 cause or to her having the hots for him			1
i suspect it 's both , but the former aspect is n't really fleshed out			0
the real crime here is that there is a potentially great movie in the premise			0
the concept of a brutally fascist world were time is literally money and where the poor are haunted and driven by the specter of impending death is an intriguing one			1
alas , @entity3 's screenplay does n't quite nail it , giving us a flat , uncomplicated story , some rather herky - jerky character development and an endless stream of absurd plot points			0
yes , there are some legitimately suspenseful moments , but not enough to make up for the rest			0
there is a lot of dramatic fodder in the story of a future as horrific as this one and " in @entity10 " does n't really take advantage of the opportunities			0
it 's not nearly as menacing or terrifying as its premise suggests and it does n't say much , except in the simplest it 's - bad - when - rich - people - hoard - resources fashion			0
i 'm curious as to what a filmmaker like @entity244 , @entity245 or @entity246 would have done with as rich of a set - up			0
the fact that " in time " could have been an exceptional film is the most upsetting part			2
i would rather it have been a truly bad film than a mediocre film with the specter of greatness hovering just out of reach			0
" in @entity10 " is rated @entity258			0
there 's a fair amount of gun violence , death , the occasional four - letter word ( and their various variants ) an underwater bare bottom , and some clothed sexual suggestions .			0
