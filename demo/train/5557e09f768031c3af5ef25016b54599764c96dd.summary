kudos to the rabble rousers in the class of 2014 making waves across the country protesting the political views of commencement speakers			1
your intentions are entirely in the right place , but you 're going about it all wrong			0
it 's understandable to want to protest the views and actions of @entity14 , a leading war monger in the @entity17 administration who backed policies that led to so many needless @entity21 and @entity22 deaths			1
there 's a valid critique of how the @entity25 and its leader , @entity26 , actually harm poor nations with the economic conditions @entity25 loans impose			1
and the @entity30 was arguably extremely violent in its handling of occupy protesters under the leadership of chancellor @entity34			0
all three leaders have canceled planned commencement addresses after protests by students at @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 respectively			1
which does n't accomplish very much , i 'm afraid			1
the media story -- and thus the public discussion generally -- is now about free speech and the marketplace of ideas and whether today 's college students are so intolerant of different viewpoints that they try and banish them altogether			1
we 're discussing whether the class of 2014 is too entitled when we should be talking about the failures of foreign policy in the @entity17 administration and appropriate police powers in a post- 9/11 security state			0
is the @entity53 too entitled ? not necessarily			0
but you might not be good organizers			0
so to those of you who have n't raised objections to commencement speakers yet , or who are getting a jump on 2015 , here 's some advice : let them come			1
the most objectionable speaker you can imagine with a public policy reputation you find utterly detestable ? roll out the red mortar board and gown			0
then the story will be about your message , not just your miff			0
and in the age of social media , that message will spread			0
everyone 's already futzing with their smartphones under their gowns anyway			0
how can you stage an effective protest at your graduation ? here are a few ideas			1
spell out a message : use masking tape to put a letter on each mortar cap , be sure to sit in the right order with your compatriots and at the right moment , send your message without saying a single word			0
alternatively , you can achieve a similar effect by writing each letter on a manila file folder , folding each up and hiding it under your gown until the right moment			0
a great thing about this tactic is it forces you to get your critique down to its essence , which makes your message clear and easily shared by others			0
in a variation on this , students at @entity112 are planning a graduation protest placing pieces of red tape on their mortar boards to voice displeasure with the university failing to take certain steps to prevent sexual assault on campus			1
stand up and turn around : sometimes the most powerful speech comes in the form of silence			0
at the start of the commencement address , stand up and turn around			1
ideally make sure you 're not the only one -- that there are 20 or 200 people scattered throughout the graduating class who will start popping up one by one and stand silently , back to the speaker , in quiet but powerful protest			1
especially if a large number of students oppose the speaker , this is a great way to put that on display			1
on the other hand , this does n't work well with a small handful of protesters			2
students at the @entity146 organized such a protest in 2011 when @entity149 gov. @entity148 was their commencement speaker			1
@entity148 had proposed more than $ 200 million in higher education budget cuts			0
unfortunately , though , out of 5,500 graduates , only a few dozen stood in protest			2
organize a picket : sure it 's old - fashioned , but it works : a few dozen students and allies with picket signs voicing their disapproval with the chosen commencement speaker			1
it helps if you have fliers to hand out to the audience attending the commencement , so you can at least inform them of why you 're protesting even if they 're not going to join you			1
in 2012 , when @entity169 ( my alma mater ) gave an honorary degree to @entity174 billionaire @entity173 , a group of students protested @entity173 's business practices , which they argue have trampled on poor people and developing nations			2
the protest was small , but large enough to get covered by the @entity182			2
get creative : i 'm not going to encourage anything illegal or even questionably immoral , but i will say that from streaking to well - timed releases of doves , there are plenty of ways to get attention for your protest			1
you 're a creative , think - outside - the - box bunch			2
get some balloons and duct tape and tarantulas and do something inventive and attention getting			0
effective protests are n't about anger			2
bonus : even the well - known folks often give boring commencement speeches , so if you can make your protest entertaining , your fellow students will be even more grateful			1
booing and heckling are so 2004 : and they 're rude			2
i do n't mean to sound condescending or anything , but one of the things you learn as you grow up in your political activist life is that cathartic is n't a synonym for strategic			2
in fact , they 're often diametrically opposed			0
you might feel damn proud of yourself as you 're being hauled off by campus security after screaming at some neoconservative commencement speaker but at least a third of the audience thinks you 're an obnoxious jerk			1
and a third do n't know why you were protesting and / or forgot that you even protested a second after it happened			1
the third who support you ? they 'll support you no matter what , so try a different tactic and see if you can broaden your support and engage and inform a wider swath of the audience			0
activism is n't about self - expression			1
it 's about changing hearts and minds and engaging more and more people in the fight for change			0
but you ca n't change those hearts and minds and get more people engaged if you are n't even heard in the first place			2
invite those different opinions onto your campus , instead of dismissing them			2
we need to engage more with ideas we disagree with , that 's what sharpens our own views and ideas			0
and if you do disagree , if you want to protest and do so visibly , make it count .			0

@entity258 : students protesting views of commencement speakers are well - intentioned
@entity14 , @entity26 canceled their *appearances* after outcry
@entity258 : do n't stop speakers from coming to campus , but protest if you object to their views
she says students can silently show their disapproval , but do n't be rude
