-- " @entity1 : @entity6 " takes everything that was great about the first @entity4 title and makes it bigger , bolder and better			1
@entity7 goes up against his most murderous foes with new weapons and allies in a story that expands the @entity1 universe			2
spinning off the ending of " @entity1 : @entity21 , " @entity15 decides that the best way to house all of its criminals is to wall off a large section of the city and dump them all together			1
so now , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and others are free to do whatever they want inside those walls			2
out of sight , out of mind			2
the 18 - month backstory of the game was presented in a limited series by @entity33 in the months leading up to the game 's release			1
if you did n't read the series , there may be some confusion about what 's going on when the gameplay begins			1
the city is beautifully rendered , with plenty of locations that are unique to @entity1 's enemies			0
although the regular prisoners tend to repeat themselves , each villain looks and feels very unique and true to their comic book counterparts			0
it also helps that @entity50 and @entity51 reprise their voice roles as the @entity22 and @entity1 , respectively			0
those trademark voices have become as necessary as the @entity22 's laugh or @entity1 's scowl			0
combat is similar to " @entity21 , " as rhythmic button pushing sends @entity1 from foe to foe in a fluid and almost dance - like movement with devastating effects			1
the more times you can string together attacks will open new power moves that can daze or level multiple opponents			0
@entity1 's utility belt is full with some of the same " toys " as before but with new abilities and functions			0
@entity72 , batclaws and explosive gels are back , with additional weapons like smoke pellets and a new @entity77 to help the @entity1 escape from trouble or solve puzzles			0
tutorials and the @entity82 will help you master the skills needed to succeed as well as help point you in the direction of the next objective			1
@entity6 is five times the size @entity21 was , so it is easy to get lost or misplace a mission			1
@entity1 spends most of his time traveling this new territory by grapnel gun and gliding			0
there is an opportunity to get a grapnel boost , so use it and it will cut down the time it takes to get around			0
in all , there are more than 250 upgrades and collectibles that help increase @entity1 's skills , armor and weaponry			1
take advantage of each when you can			0
all that real estate needs to be occupied , and developers filled it up with some of @entity1 's most famous and deadly foes			2
each of them wants to rule over the prisoners in @entity6 but is willing to take their shots at the @entity7 when they can			1
mr. @entity114 , two - face , @entity117 and , of course , the @entity22 are ready to battle @entity1 in their own ways			0
each has a unique agenda , and part of the gameplay is figuring out what they are up to and how best to stop it			0
the main storyline is filled with intrigue and drama			1
fighting skills alone will not win the day , and @entity1 is again equipped with a detective mode that lets him spot clues normal eyes ca n't see			1
in " @entity21 , " this mode could be turned on and pretty much left on at all times			1
in " @entity6 , " the mode stays on until @entity1 takes a hit			1
players will not want to leave it on the entire time , because they 'll miss other things that are needed to complete other missions			0
twelve complete side missions , which could be regular missions in their own right , help deepen the game 's experience and introduce even more villains and weapons to use			2
players also are assisted by allies and other heroes as they make their way through the city			0
the @entity153 once again plays a big part in hiding riddles and puzzles all over the @entity156			0
this time , however , he 's taken hostages and releasing clues to their whereabouts only when @entity1 solves a certain number of riddles			0
be warned : there are 400 secrets to be discovered , so do n't pass up an opportunity to find them when you can			2
catwoman is a playable character in the game , with her own adventures and missions			1
there is some crossover between her and @entity1 during cut scenes , but fighting and puzzle - solving are all things she does on her own			2
she has some special abilities , like being able to climb on ceilings and use her whip and bolas to take down enemies			0
she also has more than 50 trophies and upgrades that can be collected by only her			2
the mastermind behind all the action ? well , you do n't read comic books from the back to the front , do you ? suffice to say , the game story takes plenty of twists and turns , revealing more about the @entity7 and his rogues			1
the action is well balanced between fighting objectives and detective work and has a nice flow and pace			1
it is a very deep game with a lengthy storyline , plenty of side missions and hundreds of collectibles			1
the playable @entity167 sections are a nice addition that weaves in and out of the main story but never feels out of place			2
through it all , players will become enmeshed in the @entity1 universe and experience it all as if they were looking through the eye slits of the @entity7 's cowl and into his mind			0
it is a wonderful mix of classic characters , enhanced combat and new highlights that makes " @entity1 : @entity6 " worthy to wear the bat - logo			1
" @entity1 : @entity6 " will be available tuesday in @entity224 , wednesday in @entity225 , october 21 in @entity226 and november 23 in @entity227 for the @entity228 and @entity229			1
a pc version is expected to be released in november , and a @entity232 version is planned for 2012			0
the game is rated @entity234 due to alcohol reference , blood , mild language , suggestive themes , use of tobacco and violence			2
this review was done playing a review copy on the @entity229			0
