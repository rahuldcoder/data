@entity0 , the @entity1 - winning writer whose 1992 book " what it takes " remains one of the most detailed and passionate of all presidential campaign chronicles , died monday night , according to his longtime agent , @entity6			1
the cause of death was lung cancer			0
@entity0 's work -- and work ethic -- was legendary among reporters			1
he talked in firm , declamatory bursts in a growl of a voice tinged with cigars and alcohol			0
he was generous with other writers , dogged in his pursuit of information , and known for idiosyncratically " doing things in his own way , on his own schedule , " recalled @entity6			2
" he was stubborn , charming and the most brilliant person i knew -- and the warmest , " she said			2
" he was an unmatched talent who set an enormously high bar for political journalism			0
i will miss him , " said vice president @entity30 in a statement			0
@entity30 and @entity0 became friendly when the author was working on " what it takes			1
" @entity36 senior political analyst @entity35 , echoing many , attests to his generosity			0
she was a cub reporter for the old @entity38 when she was assigned to the @entity40 statehouse beat			0
@entity0 , then with the ( @entity42 ) @entity41 , took her under his wing			1
" i was this new kid on the block , and he 'd been around and knew @entity40 politics very well , and he was smart and a brilliant writer -- and kind to a new reporter on the beat , " she said			2
@entity0 put all his fury , emotion and eye for detail on the page in such works as " @entity56 : a @entity57 " ( 2000 ) , " how @entity58 " ( 2004 ) and especially " what it takes , " a 1,047 - page account of the 1988 presidential race			1
" what it takes " reads like @entity62 on speed , like @entity64 left out in the wild			2
it 's fueled by @entity0 's determination to find out just exactly why people are crazy enough to run the obstacle course in pursuit of the nation 's highest office			1
the book contains astute and sympathetic profiles of @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity30 and particularly @entity79			0
the latter comes across as particularly rich , with his distinctive third - person speaking style and tossed - off " @entity83 , " all rendered with @entity0 's painterly eye			1
" too much political journalism today , even in book form , is geared more toward staff feuds and soap opera and less to what @entity0 spent so much time in 1988 exploring : what makes these candidates tick , and what drives them to compete in such an arduous -- and yes , at times , ridiculous process , " said @entity36 's chief national correspondent , @entity85 , who covered the @entity78 campaign that year			1
@entity0 plunged into the day - to - day drudgery of a presidential campaign with a vengeance , and what emerges is half winged exultation , half death march			1
( indeed , the strain of doing the book made him very ill , though reports that it nearly killed him were " exaggerations , " said @entity6			0
) in the long history of campaign works , which includes @entity64 's " making of the president " series , @entity113 's " @entity114 " and @entity115 and @entity117 's gossipy " @entity116 , " @entity0 's tome looms large -- " one of the most important books on @entity121 politics in the 20th century , " said @entity122 , a former editor at the @entity123 and a @entity0 colleague			1
the book was hugely influential			0
" @entity0 transformed a whole generation of political reporters with his sweeping chronicle of the 1988 campaign , " said @entity126 , host of @entity36 's " @entity127 " and @entity129 bureau chief for @entity130			1
" while almost no one could write and report as he did , he set the bar higher for everyone			0
" @entity0 was fascinated as much by the machinery that produced power and hero worship as he was by the people at their center			1
" he was a journalist who listened and watched particularly well , " says @entity143 , a senior faculty member at the @entity144 and another former @entity123 colleague			0
" he went places most of us aspired to , but he got there			0
" such determination did n't often sit well with reviewers			0
" what it takes " was criticized as self - indulgent ; " how @entity58 , " which painted a bleak picture of @entity0 's former @entity155 stomping grounds , was knocked as simple - minded			1
and @entity0 's warts - and - all @entity56 biography , though a bestseller , was slammed for the author 's blunt handling of the @entity162 hero			1
@entity0 " relentlessly , pulverizingly tells us that the man was n't worthy of the legend built up around him , " @entity163 wrote in @entity164			1
the review was headlined " @entity169			0
" @entity0 , of course , did n't see it that way			1
" i think among older fans there 's a sense that i 'm somehow messing with their own memories , which was never my intent , " he told @entity36 at the time			2
" i can understand their annoyance			0
but to me the life of @entity56 was always more interesting than the myth			1
" @entity0 was born in @entity182 , @entity183 , in 1950 , and studied at @entity185 and @entity186 's journalism school			1
he worked at @entity41 in the 1970s and then at the @entity123 from 1977 to 1984			0
he won a @entity1 for his @entity155 reporting in 1979			1
as a freelance writer , he wrote a number of well - received profiles , including a @entity192 piece on @entity193 , an @entity195 cover story on @entity42 mayor ( and later @entity40 governor ) @entity198 , and a much - talked - about story on @entity200 , later reprinted as the book " what do you think of @entity200 now ? " despite his renown among journalists , he was n't always an easy sell , recalls @entity6			0
after she signed him -- " intercepting " him from agency head @entity207 because she loved his newspaper and magazine work -- she spent years funneling him book ideas from interested publishers			0
" he 'd say , ' no , no , no , no , no , ' and i would say ( to others ) , ' he 's really the type of person who needs to come up with his own idea			2
' " when he finally had his own idea , it was for " what it takes , " a mammoth undertaking that frightened publishers			2
" i said , ' @entity0 , that 's a great book idea , but it 's not a first book			1
it 's like a 10th book			2
' and he went , ' sell it , ' " said @entity6			0
" with just four books and a handful of magazine articles over his long post-newspaper career , @entity0 operated on his own clock			1
sometimes that meant literally , said @entity6			0
one morning , while researching " what it takes , " he called her at 7:30 , saying that he had missed a 7:15 flight			2
" what time did you get there ? " she asked			0
" 7:20 , " he replied			0
but that was @entity0 , agree his friends , an occasionally shambling presence who was also a keen observer , a raconteur , a baseball fan , a master of ceremonies			2
( he served the latter role at @entity252 's wedding			2
) @entity143 imagines him in another time , another place , holding court with some other witty friends			0
" it 's probably not too much a stretch to imagine @entity0 sitting at the @entity258 , sharing great thoughts with other people , " he said			1
@entity0 is survived by his wife , @entity262 , and a daughter , @entity263			2
an earlier marriage ended in divorce			0
according to @entity41 , there will be no funeral at @entity0 's request .			1
