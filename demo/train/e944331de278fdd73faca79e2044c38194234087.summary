@entity0 -- several @entity3 cities have shown improvements with air quality information -- a politically - sensitive issue in @entity7 -- but improvements are still needed , according to a @entity10 - based non-profit environmental group			1
the report by the @entity12 assessed air quality monitoring in 113 cities across @entity7			1
the cities with the most transparency in air quality data included @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity10 , with the most improved cities being @entity18 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
compared with the organization 's last report based on 2010 data , @entity3 cities have made significant progress , said @entity28 , the founding director of the @entity12			1
" some @entity3 cities have moved forward , " he said			1
" among all 113 cities , there is still a large number of them which are not making proper disclosure			2
" in january , @entity10 started releasing information about air pollutants in finer detail by looking at the presence of smaller pollutants , @entity40 , which are particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers			0
the previous standard was @entity40			0
smaller particles are believed to pose major health risks including risks of premature death , heart and lung diseases , according to the @entity50 @entity49			0
analysts blame the thick haze that regularly shrouds the country 's cities on rapid urbanization and industrialization			0
@entity10 , for instance , burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010 , according to state - run media			0
despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto - plate lottery , it 's estimated that @entity10 now has over 5 million cars , up from about 3.5 million in 2008			0
pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city 's population ( 17 million ) and the rapid speed of its economic growth , experts say			0
some cities need time to get new air quality monitoring machines and to train new staff to operate them , @entity28 said			1
the worst level of disclosure of city air quality data was in western @entity7 , he added			1
@entity7 is less industrialized than its eastern counterpart			0
but economic differences may not fully explain why some cities lag in releasing air quality data			1
" we do notice that there are some other cities which are highly polluted , for example steel cities in the @entity88 province			0
their pollution level is very high , but they are not making much disclosure , " he said			0
@entity3 authorities have been accused of not properly assessing the extent of the problem , prompting @entity50 diplomatic missions across @entity7 to provide air pollution information to the @entity50 community so that " it can use to make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities , " according to @entity50 @entity103 in june			1
the @entity50 readings are widely viewed as a reliable alternative to the official index maintained by @entity7 's @entity107			0
derived from a monitoring station in each of the embassy grounds , they typically paint a starker portrait of air quality than official reports , often falling within " unhealthy " bands , as defined by a rating system developed by the @entity50 @entity49			1
but this independent monitoring has provoked an angry response in @entity7			0
in june , a senior @entity3 official demanded that foreign embassies stop issuing air pollution readings saying that embassies lacked legal authority to monitor the environment			1
@entity10 has now added 35 new monitoring locations and ranks as the top city in monitoring for smaller pollutants , according to the @entity129 ' report			2
by august 2012 , over 55 cities and 192 places published pm 2.5 data , the report added			2
" there have been progress significantly in a very short period of time -- thanks to the push made by extensive public participation , " @entity28 said			0
despite some progress , other @entity3 cities have lagged behind			1
twenty - nine cities , including @entity144 â € ” @entity7 's biggest metropolis -- @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 , did not publish any information			2
cities with highest air quality information transparency 1			2
@entity10 cities with lowest air quality information transparency 1			2
