-- what do you tell a worried parent when their concerns are confirmed , that their child has been diagnosed with a food allergy ? i 'm in this position regularly as i work with families who are receiving this often unexpected news for the first time			1
unfortunately , food and skin allergies are becoming increasingly more common in @entity17 children , according to a recent report from the @entity19			1
i 'm also a parent who was on the receiving end of this food allergy diagnosis regarding my own child			1
admittedly , it was difficult to hear			2
i had my fingers crossed as i braced and prepared for the news			2
nonetheless , it was still a huge blow			2
our allergist was particularly kind as he informed me that my child was allergic to both peanuts and tree nuts , reminding me , " @entity35 , you are not to blame			2
" of course i knew this , but it was helpful to be reminded that afternoon			2
you may even come to depend on your allergist as a friend			2
these food allergy evaluations are really a partnership , and more is involved in the diagnosis than doing a quick and easy test			1
understanding the types of reactions your child has to certain foods , the timing of eating the food in relationship to these reactions , your child 's personal history and the family history : all of these components are critical to helping develop a successful food allergy survival lifestyle			1
i also have personal experience with food allergies			1
i was born severely allergic to fish			0
three decades ago , when i was a young person , the outlook on food allergy within the community at large was vastly different than it is now			1
food allergy and anaphylaxis were not recognized as a major public health concern ; the education and advocacy that surrounds this issue today simply did n't exist			1
instead , food allergies were considered vague and very mysterious , and hardly anyone was prepared for allergic reactions to foods			1
there were no safety guidelines in any restaurants , and many ignorantly thought that severely food allergic people were " hysterical " or that they simply did n't like a certain food			1
epinephrine injectors were thought to be primarily used to treat bee stings			0
i made countless visits to emergency rooms , wondering if i would make it			0
no one thought to have me carry an auto - injector or rescue medication at all , and so each and every allergic reaction spiraled out of control			0
i was forever covered with itchy eczema patches			0
i almost died too many times to count			0
because of my history , i was determined with my daughter 's diagnosis to provide a " normalized " and non-panicked environment where the allergy does n't define her and there is ample awareness and support			0
here 's what i do when a parent comes to me : first , i just listen			0
i take in their experience of challenges , the hurdles at school and at birthday parties , the scorn and disbelief from some , and ultimately their worst fears			0
next , we take action : i remind parents that food allergies are a proven source of stress , and i 'm completely honest that the early adjustment period can be extremely difficult			1
i reinforce , though , that what might seem like a huge amount of work in the beginning quickly becomes familiar and easier			0
currently , there is no cure for food allergies , so early recognition and management of allergic reactions are important measures to prevent serious health consequences			1
strict avoidance is by far the most effective means of surviving successfully with this medical condition			0
it 's important for a parent to ensure that your household is allergy - safe for kids			0
once a doctor has confirmed your child has a food allergy , you should immediately clear every item he or she ca n't eat from your pantry , refrigerator and freezer			1
it 's also a good idea to thoroughly clean and sanitize your cooking utensils , oven , stovetop and cookware			1
why ? keeping unsafe items out of your food storage and preparation areas will reduce opportunities for cross-contamination			1
cross-contamination is the cooking or serving of different foods with the same utensils and surfaces			1
food allergens can be transferred via unwashed hands or utensils , preparation surfaces , fryer vats and even garnishes			1
also , be certain to carefully check soaps , lotions , cosmetics and toiletries for potentially allergenic items , because they can easily end up on little hands and mouths			0
do n't assume that friends and family will remember to avoid reaction - causing foods after you 've told them about your child 's allergy			1
they do n't live with your child 's food allergy every single day and are n't in the habit of checking every label every time			2
you may need to remind them every once in a while , and in the meantime , teach your child that when they 're unsure about a food , they need to say , " no , thank you ! " until everyone is used to the food allergy diagnosis			2
as parents are learning more about the child 's allergic reaction symptoms , i suggest they bring family members or caretakers to doctor appointments			0
that can be vital in getting everyone onto the same page			0
above all else : i remind parents to always keep allergy medications nearby and up to date			0
both over-the - counter antihistamines and prescribed epinephrine auto - injectors have an expiration date , after which their effectiveness diminishes			0
at first , this allergy diagnosis can feel insurmountable			0
you think everything will be dramatically restricted , but day - to - day family life can still be wonderful and " normal " once you adjust to the little steps involved in protecting your family member from certain foods .			2

@entity19 : food allergies are on the rise in @entity17 children
clear out any foods from the pantry to which your children have allergies
be careful of cross-contamination when cooking
