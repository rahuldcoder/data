to talk about his column condemning group - blame in the wake of the brutal beheading of a @entity11 soldier ; and @entity12 and @entity13 offer their take on a commencement address for the class of 2013			1
first , one of the most polarizing figures in @entity21 politics decided not to run for re-election this week			1
i think i heard church bells ringing in reaction			0
congresswoman @entity4 was briefly an icon of the tea party movement and even pursued an ill - advised presidential campaign that resulted in numerous -- and ongoing -- ethics investigations			1
@entity4 used her 15 minutes of fame to divide and demagogue our national debates , routinely accusing opponents of being anti-american and parroting conspiracy theories from her congressional pulpit			2
her frequently fact - free accusations made her a favorite on the far - right , but interestingly it is @entity39 like @entity12 who already think they 're going to miss her the most , while @entity13 sees her departure as a win for reforming the @entity44			0
@entity5 is best known as a @entity11 comedian and tv / film star , who , in addition to co-starring in the upcoming animated film " @entity47 , " is also a @entity51 - quoting , part - time essayist			2

but it 's a lively , thoughtful conversation -- especially considering that @entity5 informed us afterward that he conducted it naked looking in a mirror			2
which is a sideways segue to commemorating the end of another college year			0
yes , its commencement address season and already words of wisdom are being dispensed on college campuses across the country by the likes of @entity105 , president @entity106 and @entity107			0
the millennial generation is coming of age and we debate whether the " everybody gets a trophy " ethos ( plus the uphill economic climb ) has left them well prepared for life after college			0
@entity12 orates a commencement address of his own , while @entity13 and i dispense our advice ( you have to be willing to work hard if you want to follow your bliss )			1
plus , i trot out a dimly remembered quote i like : " the only place where success comes before work is the dictionary			0
" our collective consensus slogan : ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2013 : lower your expectations			0
