@entity0 , a leading critic of @entity3 spying , appeared caught in a bind when a news report claimed that the @entity3 giant conducted espionage of its own			1
but there is no hypocrisy here , the @entity0 government says , even as it defends its own snooping by using the same arguments the @entity14 has espoused			2
" i see the situations as completely different , " @entity0 justice minister @entity15 told @entity16 , the newspaper that broke the story of @entity0 's spying , in comments reported tuesday			1
@entity22 falls out of love with @entity24 over @entity25 spying claims what the @entity25 is accused of doing to @entity0 and other countries is a breach of secrecy , he said			1
" that is interception of data , interceptions of phone calls			0
intercepts that affront @entity0 's sovereignty , " he said			2
what @entity0 did was engage in counterespionage measures that are allowed under its law , the minister said			0
based on reports , the type of spying @entity0 engaged in pales in comparison with what the @entity14 is accused of			2
@entity48 to summon @entity14 ambassador over spying allegations diplomatic relations between the the @entity14 and @entity0 were strained after leaked documents claimed that the @entity25 spied on @entity0 president @entity53 and her aides			1
in the wake of the @entity25 scandal , @entity0 postponed a state visit to the @entity14 , and @entity0 and @entity58 were drafting a @entity60 resolution on privacy in electronic communication			1
the twist came last week , when @entity16 revealed that @entity0 itself spied on foreign diplomats inside @entity0 in 2003 and 2004			1
its targets included officials from @entity68 , @entity69 and the @entity14			0
on monday , @entity0 's @entity70 , which overseas intelligence gathering , admitted that it had spied but defended its actions			1
not only did the spying take place 10 years ago , but it took place within the bounds of @entity0 laws to protect national interests , the government said in a statement			2
while respecting the freedom of the press in @entity0 , it is a crime to leak classified information , and those responsible for the leak will be prosecuted , the statement said			0
these statements echo @entity14 arguments that it acted within its legal framework and that the @entity14 leaker , @entity90 , should face criminal charges			0
@entity92 gave a third argument in defense of the @entity0 spying , which also sounds familiar : that every country engages in this type of activity			1
the difference , he told @entity16 , is that @entity0 's spying did not violate anyone 's rights or sovereignty			2
" this seems to me a very crucial difference , " he said			0
" if we do n't make that distinction , it gives the impression that what we are using the same method that we are criticizing			0
that is not the case			0
" spying on allies - everybody does it			0

@entity0 admitted that it spied on diplomats in 2003 and 2004
the country has been one of the *biggest* critics of spying by the @entity25
