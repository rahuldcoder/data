-- @entity2 linebacker @entity1 said wednesday he was the victim of a " sick joke " that had him and legions of fans believing in a " girlfriend " who may never have existed			1
@entity1 was the subject of an inspirational story in which he overcame the deaths of his real - life grandmother and his girlfriend as his team marched toward the @entity14			1
@entity1 , the @entity16 runner - up , released a statement and @entity2 held a news conference wednesday night after the sports website @entity20 published an article that called the girlfriend story a hoax			1
last september and october , @entity1 told interviewers the losses of the women , who reportedly died within hours of each other , inspired him to honor them with sterling play on the field			1
" i miss ' em , but i know that i 'll see them again one day , " he told @entity30			0
that and other media reports led to a gripping human interest story of determination			0
the girlfriend was identified as @entity37 , who had supposedly died of leukemia			0
@entity39 , director of athletics at @entity2 , told reporters that @entity1 was the victim of an elaborate hoax			1
" and he will carry that with him for a while , " @entity39 said			0
investigators do n't know how many people may have participated in the hoax , he said			0
@entity2 said the relationship between @entity1 and the supposed girlfriend involved online and lengthy telephone communication			1
as part of the hoax , several meetings were set up , including in @entity53 , but @entity37 never showed , @entity39 said			1

@entity1 's father , @entity55 , told the @entity56 ( @entity57 ) @entity58 last fall that his son did have the opportunity to meet @entity37			1
" they started out as just friends , " @entity61 said , according to the newspaper			0
" every once in a while , she would travel to @entity53 , and that happened to be the time @entity1 was home , so he would meet with her there			1
but within the last year , they became a couple			0
" media reports indicate the parents never met @entity37			0
according to @entity39 , @entity1 in early december received a call from a woman claiming to be his girlfriend and telling him she was not dead			1
those calls continued but @entity1 did not answer , @entity39 said			2
@entity1 's grandmother did in fact die in september , according to @entity20 , but there is no @entity81 record of the death of the athlete 's supposed girlfriend , described as a @entity86 student			1

" according to the website , @entity37 , 22 , had reportedly been in a serious auto accident in @entity100 and was later diagnosed with leukemia			0

@entity1 said wednesday he " developed an emotional relationship with a woman i met online			2
we maintained what i thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone , and i grew to care deeply about her			0
" in his statement reported by @entity30 , the star said , " to realize that i was the victim of what was apparently someone 's sick joke and constant lies was , and is , painful and humiliating			0
" it further pains me that the grief i felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother 's death in september were in any way deepened by what i believed to be another significant loss in my life			2
" @entity1 previously told reporters he and his girlfriend would spend hours speaking on the phone			2
@entity2 said it hired an independent investigative firm to look into the situation			1
@entity39 said the independent investigation found that the perpetrators were involved in " online chatter " indicating that it was a hoax , and @entity1 was a victim			1
" i will refer you to the documentary ' @entity176 , ' " the athletic director said			0
" @entity176 " is no longer simply a river dweller , but rather a verb defined as " to pretend to be someone you 're not online by posting false information , such as someone else 's pictures , on social media sites usually with the intention of getting someone to fall in love with you , " according to an @entity191 show of the same name			0
@entity39 said he met with @entity1 's family two days before @entity2 played in the january 7 championship game and lost to @entity195			1
