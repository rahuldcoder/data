-- as a strong proponent of parental responsibility , it both amuses and angers me to see some parents lining up behind an initiative to sue @entity7 's over the inclusion of toys in their @entity10			1
the @entity11 is leading the charge in this case , pushing the state of @entity15 to ban the toys , suggesting that the toys in happy meals are inducing children to eat burgers and fries , thus contributing to the obesity epidemic in @entity23			1
as i asserted a few weeks ago in my column supporting first lady @entity27 's @entity26 initiative , i fully back efforts to end obesity among our children			1
but at what point do some folks use common sense ? for example , in a story in the @entity38 , parent @entity36 said her 6 - year - old daughter was so enamored with toys offered in partnership with the movie , " @entity44 , " she pestered her mom to collect every toy			0
that would mean going to @entity7 's every week , since the promotion was a giveaway each week			1
and that 's not something @entity36 wanted			1
so instead of being a parent and telling her child , " no , " @entity36 decided to become a plaintiff in the lawsuit			1
instead being the grownup and not giving in to the demands of a 6 - year - old , @entity36 thought it made more sense to sue @entity7 's to make her job as a parent easier			1
i 've long maintained that the problem today is n't children or the world changing			1
it 's punk parents changing			1
yes , i know that 's a strong phrase , but when a parent ca n't control a 6 - year - old , then we have some issues			1
do i have any biological children ? nope			1
but my wife and i at different times have raised six of my nieces			0
and when they lived in our home , we would take them to @entity7 's for a @entity10			2
and when we went , instead of fries , we would order them apples			0
instead of a soda , we would get apple juice or milk			0
yes , it was that simple			0
all we did was ask for the healthier options on the menu , and the girls were happy with their happy meals			1
why is this so hard ? there is a fundamental role government can play when it comes to nutrition			1
going after the cigarette makers who enticed children with cartoon characters to smoke ? good			2
limiting trans fats in cooking ? no problem here if it makes us healthier			0
what we desperately need today are real parents			2
parents who understand that it is not their job to be friends with their children but be parents			1
parents who get that having a disappointed child who does n't get his or her way all the time is n't a bad thing			1
parents who will give their child the right look when the child begins to act a fool and throw a tantrum			2
i am not one of these adults who subscribe to the notion that no one can tell them what to do and they can do it all			0
for instance , i support sex education in schools and do n't believe that we should leave that up to the parents			2
it 's called education for a reason ! count me as a major supporter of schools changing their menus to have healthier eating options			1
and i 'm also down with school uniforms			0
the heck with the peer pressure of the haves and have nots based on designer clothes			0
none of these prevent parents from doing what they want to do with their children			1
it 's all about focusing on the broader needs of the child			2
what has to be understood is that a lawsuit is n't the answer to everything			2
and if we want our children to be healthier , banning a toy will do nothing to make that happen			2
push @entity7 's to make healthy options more visible on the menu			2
i love the idea of having calorie counts on foods			0
it has changed my mind on many occasions as to what to buy in a fast food restaurant			0
push fast food joints to have a health menu option by adding a salad , fruit and / or water instead of fries and a fountain drink			0
all of these make sense			0
trying to ban a toy because a parent ca n't tell their child no is ludicrous			2
my nieces and nephews know full well that when it comes to who is in control , @entity200 does n't play around			0
i 'm not their friend or buddy ; i 'm their uncle			0
i do n't give in			0
i make it clear : my money , my rules			0
as my dad told me , " when you 're grown enough to pay all of your bills , you can make the call			0
" if a niece or nephew wants to go to @entity7 's every week for a month just to get a toy , and the deal is we only go once a month , here is the option : " we go once a month or not at all			0
" trust me , even the biggest child pest has enough sense to figure out that once a month is the better option			0
parents , buck up and be the adult in the family , and stop blaming everything on an outside agency or corporation			1
maybe @entity232 should think of suing sorry parents for not doing their job			0
now that 's a lawsuit i 'm willing to support			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

lawsuit asks @entity15 to ban happy meals , saying they *encourage* poor eating habits
@entity238 says parents want government to step in and prevent kids from bad choices
he says it 's the role of parents to exercise control on what children eat
@entity238 : parents , take responsibility and stop blaming outside corporations
