-- @entity2 football is riding the crest of a triumphant wave with two @entity6 teams in the @entity8 final and the national side one of the favorites for the @entity11			1
in contrast , no clubs from the @entity14 -- the world 's richest -- made it past the last 16 knockout stage and the @entity18 national side continues to under perform at the highest level			1
@entity21 , who played in both the @entity6 and the @entity14 as well as starring for @entity22 at the 2006 @entity11 , believes that the @entity18 game urgently needs to start investing in young talent , or risk falling even further behind			1
" @entity27 players need to play , end of , " he told @entity0			0
" there is a real lack of opportunities for young talent in the @entity14 and it needs to be addressed			2
" born in @entity32 , but with a @entity34 mother and @entity18 father , @entity21 nurtured his talents in the @entity2 system with the @entity39 youth set - up			1
he went on to win four @entity6 titles with the @entity42 giants as well as the @entity8 in the 2000 - 2001 season			2
but @entity21 admits that during that time @entity2 football , particularly at national level , was itself suffering from a lack of youngsters to replace aging stars			1
and he pays credit to the @entity2 national football association and @entity6 clubs in coming up with a plan to address that problem			1
" they put an emphasis on pushing young players through , " added @entity21			1
" you can see the result , the @entity6 improved , the national team improved and it 's a lesson for the @entity14			1
" the @entity39 squad which so comprehensively demolished @entity61 7 - 0 on aggregate in the @entity8 is packed full of their youth academy protegees			2
@entity68 , who headed the final goal of the tie , exciting 20 - year - old @entity71 , rampaging full - back @entity72 , midfielders @entity65 and @entity67 , all came through that route			0
defender @entity75 , injured earlier this year , is also a first - team regular who started his career in the academy			0
@entity78 , who stand between @entity39 and a fifth @entity8 crown , have also invested heavily in young players under the inspirational leadership of coach @entity82			1
" he 's done an incredible job , " said @entity21			2
the two jewels in their crown are acknowledged to be midfielder @entity87 -- who will move to @entity39 at the end of the season -- and forward @entity91 , both products of their academy set - up and tipped for stardom at international level			2
defender @entity97 ironically learned his trade with @entity39 before switching to @entity78 to get regular first - team action			1
they have all played a prominent role in thrilling successive victories over @entity104 clubs @entity103 and then @entity105 in the semifinal to reach the @entity108 showpiece on may 25			2
@entity21 is full of admiration for the ethos of style of play of the two @entity2 finalists			1
" they combine @entity116 efficiency now with flair , " he said			0
" they are mirror images of each other and both thoroughly deserve to reach the final			0
" @entity21 moved to @entity122 and was an integral part of the 2007 - 08 side which won the @entity14 title and @entity8 , but injuries blighted his career after that double triumph and he was forced to retire at the end of last season aged 32			1
during his spell in the @entity14 , which ended at big money @entity132 , he saw at first hand the trend towards clubs using ever more foreign imports to supplement their ranks			0
he acknowledges that with the big money on offer , the stakes are high			0
" maybe clubs are frightened to give home grown talent a chance , " he said			2
@entity22 manager @entity145 has also seen the danger signs as his side make hard work of qualifying for next year 's @entity11 in @entity149			2
" quite a few of the games i go to do not have any @entity18 players , " he was quoted as telling the @entity150			1
" so , one has to be very careful these days when talking about the @entity14 and talking about the @entity154 of it , because more than two thirds of the players in the league are not @entity18			1
" we have one of the lowest number of home - grown players to choose from in all the leagues , which , if you are national team manager , is not a great advantage , to be frank			1
" in the @entity6 , the figures for @entity2 talent getting a regular game are the polar opposite to the @entity14 , with participation at well over 60 % and it 's the same percentage in @entity104 , the reigning @entity11 and @entity172 champions			1
@entity61 's famed @entity174 academy nurtured the genius of @entity177 's @entity176 and midfield maestros @entity178 and @entity180 , who have been the corner stone of @entity104 's international success			0
on the evidence of the 7 - 0 semifinal mauling by a rampant @entity39 , @entity61 may need to replenish their ranks with younger talent , with @entity187 and @entity188 pushing to graduate to regular first team play			1
in @entity22 , there are signs that the principles @entity21 and so many others espouse may finally be incorporated into the national game			1
the @entity14 has introduced rules that mean eight of the 25 - man squads must be " home grown " talent , limiting the number of foreign players over 21 to a maximum of 17			0
the @entity14 also has high hopes for its @entity203 , which is designed to increase the number of home grown players playing football at the highest level			2
while this does not mean the @entity18 youngsters will get a starting place , it does broaden opportunity and the @entity212 ( @entity212 ) has also built a new @entity213 in @entity214 in the @entity215			0
for @entity216 it can not come a moment too soon and his former @entity122 teammate @entity218 , now an assistant coach to @entity145 , has also seen the danger signs			0
" there 's a tipping point and i think we 've gone beyond it in @entity22			0
we 're maybe 20 per cent off			0
we need to give more chances to our own			0
we 're harming ourselves a little bit			0
" he was quoted recently			0
prime target ironically , the rising star of the @entity14 is a @entity231 , @entity232 , who won the young player and player of the year awards for his incredible performances this season for @entity237			0
@entity232 was developed by @entity239 's academy , which also produced @entity240 and @entity22 striker @entity241 and @entity242 -- proof that young talent can thrive in @entity14 if given a chance			1
@entity145 and @entity218 must be ruing the fact they can not pair former teammates @entity232 , @entity241 and @entity242 in the @entity22 line - up , while @entity237 will be anxious their star asset remains at @entity251			0
after @entity61 and @entity105 's maulings at the hands of the all - conquering @entity2 sides they are rumored to be looking to supplement their own home grown @entity104 stars with big money signings and @entity232 is reportedly a prime target			0
@entity39 , with former @entity61 coach @entity260 taking over from @entity261 next season , are also not adverse to using their financial muscle as well			0
@entity78 's talisman @entity87 is switching to the @entity266 next season -- making it even harder for sides from the @entity14 and other major @entity172 leagues to challenge a likely new era of @entity2 domination .			2

@entity21 says @entity18 football need to give young players opportunities
@entity21 *highlights* success of @entity6 clubs and @entity2 national team
believes they can extend their domination in the near future
