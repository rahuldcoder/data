@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the @entity8 , the energy company said friday			1
the latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe , collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface , said @entity14 , a @entity4 spokesman			2
the insertion tube was on the sea floor , and engineers planned to move it into place later in the day , @entity14 said			1
the company has lowered a smaller containment dome for use if the insertion tube does not stem the flow of oil into the water , @entity14 said			1
but adm. @entity26 , commandant of the @entity27 , said twice friday that the containment dome , referred to as a " top hat , " was the first choice , followed by the insertion tube			2
officials could not explain the discrepancy			2
neither procedure would be a permanent solution , @entity26 said friday in @entity35			2
the procedures , he said , " will reduce the leakage , not stop the leakage			1
" the ultimate solution , @entity26 said , will be achieved by relief wells that are being drilled near the leak site			1
those will take weeks , if not months , to complete , @entity4 has said			2
after much discussion over whether the use of subsea dispersants could cause ecological damage , @entity42 rear adm. @entity42 said friday that officials have concluded that it " is an option we can consider and will move ahead with			1
" the decision was made after the results of three tests were analyzed , she said			2
" this is not a decision that was made lightly , but it is a series of tradeoffs			2
you 're really trying to minimize the impact on the environment as best as possible			0
" @entity59 , @entity4 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said the company has spent more than $ 450 million responding to the spill and that more than 14,000 people are involved in the effort			1
to date , more than 1.2 million feet of boom have been deployed and another 400,000 feet of boom have been staged for deployment , he said			1
in all , the company is trying to accumulate 3.5 million feet of boom			1
the forecast this weekend and early next week " looks very favorable to use all tools , " he said , citing burning , skimming operations and use of surface and subsurface dispersants			1
@entity59 said the spill has had " limited impact " on shore , with oil being found in four locations in @entity1 , two in @entity80 and one in @entity35			1
in @entity85 , president @entity84 criticized executives from @entity4 and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe			1
" it is absolutely essential that , going forward , we put in place every necessary safeguard and protection so that a tragedy like this oil spill does not happen again , " @entity84 said after meeting friday with @entity91 members to discuss the spill			1
read about oil spill responses " this is a responsibility that all of us share , " @entity84 said			1
" the oil companies share it			0
the manufacturers of this equipment share it			0
the agencies in the federal government in charge of oversight share that responsibility			0
i will not tolerate more finger - pointing or irresponsibility			1
" @entity4 's efforts to plug the leak come amid growing concern that the company has been low - balling how much oil has poured out of the well			1
rep. @entity121 , @entity122 , sent @entity4 a letter friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak			2
@entity121 , who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment , said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount @entity4 officials have provided			0
" the public needs to know the answers to very basic questions : how much oil is leaking into the @entity8 and how much oil can be expected to end up on our shores and our ocean environment ? " @entity121 said in a letter to @entity4			0
" i am concerned that an underestimation of the flow may be impeding the ability to solve the leak and handle management of the disaster			2
" track the oil spill @entity4 has said since the april 20 explosion of the @entity155 drill rig that about 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons -- have been pouring out of the well a day			0
the company says it reached that number using data , satellite images and consultation with the @entity27 and the @entity162			2
" i think that 's a good range , " @entity59 said friday			0
but a researcher at @entity165 said @entity4 's estimate is low			0
associate professor @entity167 said that about 70,000 barrels of oil are leaking each day , based on an analysis of video of the spill			0
" you ca n't say with precision , but you can see there 's definitely more coming out of that pipe than people thought , " he said			2
" it 's definitely not 5,000 barrels a day			0
" a @entity4 executive rejected that assertion friday			0
" well , that 's not what our experts , multiple experts , not only from @entity4 , and the industry say , " said @entity181 , @entity4 managing director for the @entity182 and @entity183			0
" this crude is what 's called a light - sweet crude			2
it has lots of gas and when it comes out , it expands very rapidly , a little bit like bubbles in a soda pop. so it 's very difficult to look at it and say that the volume will be much higher			0
we certainly do n't see that at the surface			0
" the dispute over the size of the leak caps a week in which congressional committees grilled executives from @entity4 and two other companies : drilling contractor @entity211 , which owned the rig , and oilfield services contractor @entity213 , which was responsible for cementing the well shut once drilled			1
the companies blamed each other			0
@entity4 pointed to @entity211 , which said @entity4 was responsible for the wellhead 's design and @entity213 was responsible for the cement finishing work			0
@entity213 , in turn , said its workers were just following @entity4 's orders , but that @entity211 was responsible for maintaining the rig 's blowout preventer			0
@entity224 : send your photos , videos @entity84 took exception friday			1
" i did not appreciate what i considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter , " the president said			0
" you had executives of @entity4 and @entity211 and @entity213 falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else			1
the @entity240 people could not have been impressed with that display , and i certainly was n't			2
" @entity84 said the federal government also was taking responsibility for its role			1
" for too long , for a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , " @entity84 said			1
" it seems as if permits were too often issued based on little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies			0
" that can not and will not happen anymore			0
to borrow an old phrase , we will trust , but we will verify			0
" as a result , @entity84 said , the @entity257 will be restructured , with the part of the agency that permits oil and gas drilling and collects royalties separated from the part of the agency in charge of inspecting the safety of oil rigs and platforms and enforcing the law			1
" that way , there 's no conflict of interest , real or perceived , " @entity84 said			1
in addition , @entity84 said , the administration has ordered immediate inspections of all deepwater operations in the @entity8 , and no drilling permits will be issued until a 30 - day safety - and - environmental review is completed			1
@entity84 also announced a new examination of the environmental procedures for oil and gas exploration and development			1
learn more about efforts to stop the leak @entity4 , the @entity27 and state and local authorities have scrambled to keep the oil from reaching shore or the ecologically delicate coastal wetlands off @entity1			1
they have burned off patches of the slick , deployed more than 280 miles of protective booms , skimmed as much as 4 million gallons of oily water off the surface of the @entity8 and pumped more than 400,000 gallons of chemical dispersants onto the oil			1
on friday , the @entity162 closed off to fishing another part of the @entity8 over which the federal government has jurisdiction			0
@entity162 has now closed 19,377 square miles ( 50,187 square kilometers ) , which is 8 percent of the @entity8 area within 200 miles of the coast , called an exclusive economic zone			0
the closed area a week earlier had been 4.5 percent			0
investigators are still trying to determine what caused the april 20 explosion at the rig , which sank two days later			0
eleven workers are missing and presumed dead			0
@entity2 's @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			0
