@entity0 -- the @entity2 loves a list			2
people see a list and come away asking questions : why is n't my song on the @entity14 's list of " 10 best songs about the subway			2
" or why is my state on @entity19 's ranking of the " worst 50 states in @entity21			1
" ( their winner / loser : @entity25			0
ready , set : debate			0
) lists , in short , " are awesome , " as @entity29 's ceo put it in a memo earlier this year			0
that site , which is the undisputed king of the internet list , is known for using rankings , lists and @entity36 to make people read about all kinds of wacky topics they never would have cared about , or even imagined , before			0
as i 'm writing this , the site has lists for " 11 diy recipes for your favorite ' 90s snacks , " " 29 insanely elaborate custom coffins from @entity47 " and " 4 delightfully sexist political ads from the ' 50s " on its homepage			0
i 'm not ashamed to say i totally would read that stuff			0
but i want to push the idea in a new direction			0
i 'm heading up a new @entity1 project called change the list			1
it aims to appropriate everything that 's great about lists -- shareability , intrigue , digestibility -- to the end of creating change in some of the places that need it most			1
for each project , we will start with some sort of ranking that deals with a pressing social issue			0
@entity1 will send me , your lucky guide to all things list - y , to the place at the bottom of the list			1
i 'll report on what 's going wrong , why the issue matters , and what could be done to help			0
then i 'll enlist ( pun intended , sorry ... ) you , @entity1 's dutiful readers , in a social campaign created to help bump that place off the bottom of the list			1
it 's a collective experiment in make - a - difference journalism			1
the goal is that , together , we can change the list			2
the first @entity89 project focuses on voter participation in the @entity21			1
you may have heard there 's this little election coming up in november ? despite the fact that pundits have been yacking about the race for years , and candidates are spending unprecedented dollars on attack ads , millions of @entity21 will wake up on november 6 and go about the day as if they were n't blessed with the opportunity to help decide the future of the world 's pre-eminent democracy			1
this is particularly true in @entity106 , where fewer than half the state 's eligible voters cast a ballot in 2008			1
that 's the case even though @entity111 is @entity106 's ( for - real , certifiable ) native son			1
@entity106 , rather consistently , has the lowest voter turnout rate in the @entity21			1
less than 49 % of eligible people voted in the 2008 presidential election , according to data crunched by @entity116 from @entity117			0
compare that to the top state , @entity120 , where almost 78 % voted			0
i 'm in @entity106 this week to look into why that 's the case -- and to see what people there are trying to do to increase voter participation in paradise			1
the trip will include a meeting with @entity106 , a nonpartisan group that 's going door to door to register first - time voters			2
volunteers are uploading photos of these new civic participants -- the people who actually have the power to change the list -- to @entity139			2
photos submitted via @entity141 and @entity142 with the hashtag # changethelist also will pop up soon on this @entity1 page			2
( if you 've never voted , please make a pledge to do so here )			0
i 'm also planning to visit the district with the lowest of the low voter turnout rates in @entity106 ; a meeting with a homeless candidate who won the @entity153 primary for a @entity21 @entity155 race ; and conversations with people in the state who do n't vote because they say the @entity21 is illegally occupying the islands			1
when i get back , we 'll try to create a conversation that could change the list -- that could bump @entity106 out of 50th place			1
look for a stream of content on voter turnout between now and november , when i 'll report back on our successes and failures			1
the aim of @entity174 , by the way , is not to shame the countries , cities or states that fall at the bottom of the lists			0
it 's to seek understanding that could lead to solutions			0
there 's a fair chance the concept may leave you thinking something like this : " hey , but wo n't another place fall to the bottom of the list when it 's over ? " know that you 're right			2
but i think of it this way : by trying to boost a place off the bottom of the list , we hope to raise standards for everyone			2
you can follow this journey -- to @entity106 and beyond -- on the new change the @entity204			2
sign up for an e-mail newsletter to get updates on how you can help with this project			0
for a primer on voting in @entity106 , also check out these links : the list : @entity106 has the lowest voter turnout rate why does n't @entity106 vote ? some hypotheses on who votes and who does n't ... in the early 1960s , 94 % of @entity216 voted to up voter turnout : say ' thank you ' map : @entity106 voter turnout by precinct and if you have questions , please ask , either on social media or in the comments section on this post			1
i 'll do my best to find answers			0
until then , mahalo !			0
