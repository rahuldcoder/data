-- as a lifelong resident of @entity3 , i refuse to be part of the social system that breeds problems rather than solutions			1
@entity3 is a " food desert " where the lack of healthy food alternatives leads to obesity and preventable disease			1
i have raised my sons in @entity3 , and it is heartbreaking to see so many young kids on a trajectory to nowhere , potential high school dropouts prey to gangs , drugs , violence and incarceration			1
so where do we start to create positive change ? i believe that change starts from within , and unless you want to take the first step , change will never happen			1
we need to take the responsibility to be the creative force in our society			2
we need to be the gardeners of our society			2
@entity31 : @entity33 's talk on gardening in @entity3 so instead of waiting for others ( the city or other units of government ) , i decided to take my shovel , my weapon of change , and start gardening			1
@entity42 begins with youth and healthy role models			1
gardening takes care of both			1
children learn what they live			1
if children live with hostility , they learn to fight			1
if they live with fear , they learn to be apprehensive			0
if they live with criticism , they learn to condemn			0
if they live around alcohol , drugs , unhealthy food and violence , this is what they will reproduce in their lives and in society in general			1
this is a vicious circle that needs to end			0
my vision is that gardening can do that -- and my organization has been planting gardens in @entity3 , including ones on city - owned land			1
if kids grow kale , kids eat kale			0
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes			0
but when none of this is presented to them , if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever you put in front of them			2
when kids learn to grow vegetables , they learn not only how to eat in a healthy way but how to be productive and are armed with a value system that will help them to navigate in their lives -- values such as patience , appreciation , sharing , honesty and respect			2
you will be surprised how kids are affected by this			0
one day , i was out in my garden attending to my sunflowers when a teenager passed by with his earphones hooked up , listening to his music			0
when he saw the huge sunflowers in my garden , he was taken aback : " @entity118 ! is dat real ? " he was screaming			0
a few days later , he joined us in the garden			0
@entity122 : a visit to @entity33 's garden but gardening 's therapeutic effect is not only for kids			1
i have been to homeless shelters to install gardens			0
people will come around and will start telling stories of gardening with their mothers and grandmothers			2
i see hopeless faces light up ; i see the seed of hope where none existed before , and this is for me a great reward			0
our society -- not just @entity3 -- suffers from social corrosion			1
due to the economic crisis , parents have to work long hours ( if they are lucky enough to have a job ) , and often , kids are neglected			0
in many cases , kids grow up with their tv set as parent			0
technology offers more ways of nominal communication , but our society tends to promote actual isolation			0
it is crucially important to cultivate nourishing relationships and human connections , and gardening can definitely do that			2
so who do you want to be : a bystander or a force of positive change ? pick up your shovel , bring some compost and come meet me in the garden			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity33 .			1
