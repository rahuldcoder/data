-- i know from experience how the lack of tangible evidence gnaws at an accident investigator			0
eventually , the passion driving efforts to find answers is replaced with a feeling of futility and hopelessness			0
for the investigator in charge , valuable time that could be spent on the search and investigation will be spent justifying the cost of the search to the bureaucracy			1
but as the search for @entity23 resumes after a four - month hiatus , investigators must realize the question here is not how much it will cost to find the airplane and determine the cause to ensure it wo n't happen again			1
instead , the question should be this : how much will it cost if they do n't ? armed with new maps of the seafloor from an extensive survey operation funded by the @entity37 , the @entity33 has resumed the underwater search for @entity23			1
three ships will begin searching for debris on the ocean floor in a refined search area after new information revealing an attempt to communicate with the plane via satellite phone prompted investigators to revise the search area much farther south than previously			2
each of the search vessels has been fitted with sophisticated underwater sonar equipment designed to use a towed device to examine the bottom of the ocean floor for abnormalities that may be remnants of the @entity56 that vanished from radar on march 8			2
the @entity58 being used is much more capable , and can work at more extreme depths , than the @entity60 21 used in previous searches			0
but all this sophisticated equipment and trained scientists to operate it is not cheap			0
@entity66 deputy prime minister @entity65 announced a $ 50 million ( @entity66 dollars ) contract in august to fund yet another round of searches for the missing plane and 239 passengers and crew , while @entity66 air chief marshal @entity72 reportedly estimated as much as $ 25 million has been paid to the defense force for the visual search it conducted			1
in addition , another $ 60 million has been committed for the underwater search			2
finally , if and when the aircraft is found , the retrieval and causal investigation could easily add $ 50 million or more to the price tag			0
all this adds up to what would be the costliest search in history , more even than the estimated $ 160 million in recovery costs for @entity87 off the coast of @entity89 in 2009			1
the search area for that plane was narrowed to only five square miles within weeks , and yet it took nearly two years to find and recover the remnants of the @entity95 aircraft			2
the search and recovery area for @entity23 is exponentially greater , at some 23,000 square miles , and may therefore be exponentially more expensive			1
but while it is understandable against the backdrop of such rising costs why investigators might be tempted to abandon the search , the consequences of not establishing the cause of the tragedy could be disastrous			0
after all , without some kind of assurance that the problem has been corrected -- clearly not possible without knowing what happened -- it could happen again at any time to any airline			0
the reality is that accidents without answers produce doubts about safety , and such doubt can eventually take a toll on the entire airline industry , not just one particular air carrier			0
true , millions of people continue to fly in the wake of the disappearance of @entity23			1
but tens of millions of dollars in passenger revenue have already been lost as @entity126 's jets reportedly fly with large numbers of vacant seats			1
as a result of the drop in passenger numbers , @entity129 is set to be removed from the stock exchange as part of a 12 - point recovery plan in an effort to rebound from the losses			0
but imagine the damage it could do to the entire airline industry if there is another tragedy and still no answer to the question of what caused the disappearance of @entity23			1
such a turn of events would rock not only passengers ' faith in the airlines ' ability to keep them safe , but also governments ' ability to assure safe air travel			0
ultimately , while the cost of the search can be counted , the costs of giving up can not be fully calculated			1
but they are surely higher , in terms of lost revenues and damaged public confidence			0
put bluntly , the best way of ensuring that the tragedy of @entity23 is not repeated is to find the plane -- or what remains of it -- and work out what actually caused this in the first place			2

search has resumed for missing @entity23
@entity66 has already spent millions of dollars on search , @entity172 notes
@entity23 search set to be most expensive in history , @entity172 says
but the cost of not finding out what happened even greater , he says
