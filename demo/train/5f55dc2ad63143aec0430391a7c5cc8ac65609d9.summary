" " we candidly can not support an @entity17 treaty that is inconsistent with a multi-stakeholder model of @entity7 governance , " said @entity9 during a conference session			1
" as the @entity17 has stated , this conference was never meant to focus on @entity7 issues			0
however , today we are in a situation where we still have text and resolutions that cover issues on spam and also provisions on internet governance			1
" " internet policy should not be determined by member states but by citizens , communities , and broader society , and such consultation from the private sector and civil society is paramount , " he continued			1
" this has not happened here			0
" the @entity1 decision to withdraw comes following a surprise move late wednesday in which the chair of the conference called a voice vote on controversial proposal that encourages governments to help expand global internet access			1
it was approved in a controversial manner that left some participants confused and upset			0
additionally , many countries -- the @entity1 included -- are opposed to including in the treaty any language about the internet at all			1

called the @entity10 on @entity11 , or @entity77 , the conference was intended to update a treaty governing international telecommunications that has n't been refreshed since 1988			2
since the conference began , the @entity1 delegation has argued that internet governance issues are outside the scope of the conference			1
other countries , including @entity84 and @entity85 , disagreed , submitting proposals intended to help governments fight cyberattacks and spam			0
