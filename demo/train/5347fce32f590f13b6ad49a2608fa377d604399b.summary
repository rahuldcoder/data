-- in @entity4 soccer , the punishment for racially abusing an opponent is a 10 - match ban			1
in @entity7 , the same offense could result in the offending team being penalized 15 yards			1
that 's the proposal on the table when the @entity12 's @entity11 meets next week , as the body considers penalizing players for using abusive language during games			1
high on the list of derogatory slurs the @entity12 is trying to outlaw is use of the ' n - word ' , while penalties for homophobic comments are also being discussed			1
a second incident could result in ejection			2
" it is a potential rule modification being discussed by our @entity26 , " the @entity12 statement read			2
" the committee has not decided on a formal proposal to our clubs , who have to approve rule changes by a 3/4 vote ( 24 of 32 teams )			2
" rule change proposals are presented to our teams at our annual league meeting in late march			1
" the game officials already have substantial authority to police verbal abuse / unsportsmanlike conduct and they understand the league 's focus on respect			2
" should the @entity11 decide to approve the proposal , the body will then present their findings to the @entity12 's owners at a meeting in march			1
@entity51 became a major issue in the @entity12 last year after the @entity53 suspended offensive lineman @entity54 for detrimental conduct following allegations of misconduct from teammate @entity58			1
an independent investigation found continuing threats and verbal and physical abuse , text messages , racial slurs and vulgar sexual comments made about @entity58 's mother and sister by @entity54 and some of his @entity53 teammates			1
another @entity53 player , an unnamed offensive lineman , was allegedly subjected to homophobic name calling and improper physical touching			1
@entity54 's lawyer said the report is replete with errors , adding : " the truth ...			0
is that @entity58 was never bullied by @entity54 or any member of the @entity53 ' offensive line , " said attorney @entity75 , in a statement to @entity0			1
in @entity4 , racism generated plenty of unwanted headlines throughout 2013 - a year which featured two walk - offs involving famous @entity84 side @entity83			1
former @entity86 international @entity85 led his team off during a friendly against lower tier @entity89 in january , while @entity92 's @entity91 simply left the pitch himself in a separate incident during a match against @entity97 side @entity98 in july			1
one of the most high profile cases came in 2011 when @entity101 star @entity100 was banned for eight games after a football association panel found him guilty of racially abusing @entity105 's @entity104			1
in @entity84 , several clubs have been punished after their fans were adjudged to have racially abused visiting players - with @entity109 alone having paid $ 300,000 in fines last year after being charged four times by @entity4 football 's governing body @entity112			1
last year , @entity112 announced that players and officials will face a 10 - match ban if found guilty of racist abuse			1
@entity118 ? in the @entity123 , @entity119 -- general manager of the @entity120 and a member of the @entity12 's competition committee -- believes the proposals need thorough testing before any implementation			0
" with any rule that we put into play , we have to look at it from a to @entity132 and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences , " he was quoted as saying on the @entity12 website			0
" but as it was stated in our meeting , there are mics everywhere			0
so , if something is being said , it 's probably going to be captured somewhere			0
so , it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to			0
" last week , the head of the @entity147 , an organization dedicated to promoting diversity and equality of job opportunity in the @entity12 , said he would be surprised should the move fail to go through			0
" i will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we 're trying to do , " said @entity152 , the group 's chairman , in an interview with @entity155			0
" we want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room			0
secretaries , pr people , whoever , we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere			0
" last december , shortly after the @entity54 story broke , @entity168 called on @entity12 players to stop using the ' n - word '			2
" simply put , from this day forward please choose to not use the " n " word			0
period ! , " their statement read			0
" do not take the position that you are not bothered by the word			0
if you tolerate the language being used casually now , at some point in the future , either as a current or former player , you may hear it directed at you			2
how do you think you will respond ? " in an interview with @entity184 , @entity186 safety @entity185 , explained that the use of racial slurs is not always as it seems			2
" i think it 's going to be really tough to legislate this rule , to find a way to penalize everyone who uses this word , " said @entity185			0
" and it 's not going to be white players using it toward black players			0
most of the time you hear it , it 's black players using the word			0

@entity203 to decide on whether to punish slurs with on - pitch penalties
team guilty of abusive language would be penalized 15 yards
decision to change rules could take place as early as next month
mooted change follows @entity53 *scandal* of last year
