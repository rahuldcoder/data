-- everyone has that friend or family member who unwittingly still posts publicly on @entity4			1
it 's not that they 're over-sharers , they just have n't bothered to keep up with the social network 's ever - changing and often confusing privacy settings			1
@entity4 highlighted some of its minor new and future privacy features on tuesday , including one aimed squarely at the people left behind by complicated settings			1
a new pop - up message featuring a cartoon dinosaur will appear for @entity4 users who have n't tinkered with their privacy settings in a while			1
when someone who always shares publicly posts a link or update , @entity4 will double check that they really want to share it with that audience			0
the company 's privacy team is also testing other tweaks , including updating mobile and web designs with more prominent audience controls , a new default privacy setting for cover photos ( old images used to be public , now they 're private ) , and a message clarifying who can see an image you post when your friends re-share it			2
in its 10 years , the social media company has amassed more than a billion users			0
that 's a lot of people to please , but one area that has received consistent cries of dissatisfaction is privacy			0
when @entity4 updates a setting or adds a feature , there is often a privacy backlash , especially when new sharing settings make information public by default			1
the company 's motto , " move fast and break things " led to broken trust with users			2
to counteract that sense of wariness , @entity4 is making sure future privacy considerations are n't just part of a settings screen , but also taken into account by engineers making new features and at the infrastructure level			1
" we understand that some people have felt that @entity4 privacy has changed too much in the past , " said @entity69 , a product manager on @entity4 's privacy team			1
not changing settings ever again is n't an option , so @entity4 is searching for new ways to improve the experience that wo n't anger or alienate users			1
the company has been running extensive surveys to find out what kind of privacy experiences people are having on the site and in the app. it currently runs 4,000 surveys a day in 27 languages			0
squeezing useful information out of these surveys can be difficult			0
@entity4 engineering manager @entity90 said people will commonly just write in the word " privacy " when asked what they want to improve			2
however , enough users have managed to articulate what situations upset them			0
people said when they share things on @entity4 they feel their info is shared with more people than they wanted			0
@entity4 knows giving those people a sense of control is key to keep them from leaving the service			2
" at the end of the day ... when people have an unpleasant surprise like this it 's bad for them and it 's bad for us , " said @entity69 .			0

@entity4 is testing minor privacy settings changes to give users more control
