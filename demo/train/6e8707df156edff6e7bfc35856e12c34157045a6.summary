-- @entity1 , the contract manufacturer whose biggest customer is @entity4 , is preparing genuinely representative labour union elections in its factories in @entity7 for the first time , a powerful sign of the changes in the workshop of the world demanded by an increasingly restive workforce			1
this would be the first such exercise at a large company in @entity7 , where labour unions have traditionally been controlled by management and local government			1
@entity1 is the country 's largest private sector employer with 1.2m mainland workers			0
the @entity23 company , the world 's largest contract maker of electronics , said that the new election process would see a larger representation of junior employees and no management involvement			1
" the position of chairman and 20 committee members of the @entity34 will be determined through elections once every five years through an anonymous ballot voting process , " @entity1 said in response to questions from the @entity0			1
the move is part of @entity1 's attempts to tweak its manufacturing machine , which makes a large proportion of the world 's gadgets such as @entity46 , tablets and computers , in response to frequent worker protests , riots , strikes and soaring labour costs			1
@entity54 is also encouraging collective bargaining as a way to help contain the growing unrest			0
since a wave of worker suicides at the company 's @entity7 plants in 2009 and 2010 , its treatment of its huge workforce has attracted intense scrutiny			2
@entity1 has become a focus for criticism of practices widespread in @entity7 factories including illegal overtime , low pay and the use of underage workers			1
@entity4 reacted by bringing in the @entity74 , a @entity75 - based labour group , for an audit of some of the manufacturer 's largest plants			0
one of the issues pinpointed by the @entity74 was the union 's failure truly to represent workers			0
after the @entity86 holiday this month , @entity1 , with the help of the @entity74 , will begin training its @entity7 workers in how to vote for their representatives			2
they will be choosing up to 18,000 union committees whose terms expire this year and in 2014 , according to three people familiar with the situation			0
since the unions have so far had no real role in addressing worker grievances and have been dominated by management , most young workers know nothing about what a real labour union is supposed to do			2
@entity1 said more than 70 per cent of the 188 employee - elected representatives at its @entity104 campus were frontline workers			0
however , sources familiar with the matter said workers have historically had little say in the committees that run the union			0
" the process through which @entity1 's current labour union representatives were chosen was not democratic because there was no open and transparent nomination of candidates , and it is not representative because more than half of the committee members are from management , " said one person working on the election plans			1
the chairman of @entity1 's labour union in @entity7 , @entity123 , is the former head of the office of @entity125 , the company 's founder and chief executive			1
people familiar with the company described ms @entity130 , who uses the @entity132 name @entity133 , as a key confidante of mr @entity125 and a trusted member of the management team in @entity7			2
