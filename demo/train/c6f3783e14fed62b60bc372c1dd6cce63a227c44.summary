@entity0 -- african - americans are extremely supportive of president @entity3 , but their enthusiasm appears to have dramatically dropped from earlier this year , according to a new national poll			1
the @entity7 survey , released tuesday , also indicates that @entity3 's presidency appears to have made blacks more optimistic about race relations , but less than one in five believe the new president has ushered in a new era of race relations in the country			1
more than nine in 10 blacks questioned in the poll approve of the job @entity3 's doing in the @entity20 , far higher than 42 percent of whites who approve of his performance as president			1
but when asked how they personally feel about @entity3 's presidency , only 42 percent of black respondents say they 're thrilled , with nearly half of those questioned saying they are happy but not thrilled			1
the 42 percent who are thrilled is down from 61 percent in january , when @entity3 was inaugurated			1
" african - americans are still big fans of the first black president in @entity34 history , but the thrill is gone , " said @entity1 polling director @entity30			2
