@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 13 years old , @entity3 is his mother 's primary caregiver			1
he 's responsible for the grocery shopping and cooking			2
he does all the laundry			2
his mother , @entity10 , has been battling @entity11 for as long as @entity3 can recall , and her health has deteriorated in the last couple of years			2
@entity3 makes sure she takes her medication			2
he often helps her get dressed , and at times , he has helped her bathe			2
@entity3 ' father died two years ago			2
since then , ensuring @entity10 ' well - being has been a full - time job for @entity3 , leaving him with little energy to socialize or study			2
" it does make it hard to pay attention in class , " he said			0
" helping her out is a bigger priority than going to school and getting ( an ) education , because i feel if i do n't have her , i do n't want to go to school			1
whatever happens to her happens to me			0
" @entity3 is just one of the estimated 10,000 youth caregivers living in @entity34 , @entity1 , according to the @entity35 of @entity36			1
the nonprofit , founded by county resident @entity38 , was instrumental in bringing this previously unrecognized population to light in 2002 , and it has since provided support to more than 500 area youths who are caring for an ill , disabled or aging family member			1
" no child in the @entity44 should have to drop out of school because of caregiving , " said @entity38 , 65			1
" these children suffer silently behind closed doors			1
... they do n't have the help and the support and the recognition that they need			1
" according to a 2006 study conducted by @entity56 for the @entity57 , 22 % of high school dropouts in the @entity44 leave school to care for a family member ( @entity60 )			1
it 's these children who @entity38 had in mind when her group started the @entity65 at @entity66			1
the project , the first of its kind in the nation , aims to intervene early on in the academic lives of youth caregivers			1
special classes , led by a mental - health professional or social worker , cover topics such as coping with stress and anger , managing finances and setting goals			0
periodic field trips and overnight camps offer recreational , social and educational activities			0
there are home - care demonstrations and workshops			1
the program also makes teachers and school administrators more aware of the children 's extenuating circumstances and how they can lead to truancy , absenteeism and dips in academic performance			1
the hope is to reduce the negative effects -- anxiety , depression and feelings of isolation -- that caregiving responsibilities can have on a child 's mental , physical and emotional health			0
" we ca n't change the health condition of the person ( receiving care ) , " @entity38 said			1
" but what we can do is provide the skills and the resources and the value to the children so that they can have a little more balance in their life			1
and also so that they know that they 're not alone			0
" since 2006 , the program has been introduced into eight area middle schools and followed hundreds of students into 17 area high schools			0
" we stay with them to graduation , and it 's amazing , " @entity38 said			0
" we 've watched these kids grow up before our eyes			0
it 's nothing that happens overnight , but it 's very gratifying			0
it 's like , ' ok , there 's one more kid that 's going to make it			0
' " @entity3 joined the program last year			0
the group provided him with a computer , a bed , clothing and tutoring			1
now , he has raised his grades and aims to make the honor roll			0
he was also able to attend the group 's overnight camp while a nurse 's aide stayed with his mom			1
" i found out there are more people that do the things i do , and some do more , " he said			1
" now i 'm getting @entity152 , and i feel more confident in school			0
" children in the program are also offered a home study by a medically licensed staff member or contractor who assesses what skills and resources are most needed to support a child			1
working with dozens of community partners , @entity38 's group helps families with unique needs			1
" we 've provided clean - water systems and enlisted the support of community members to build wheelchair ramps or relocate a family from a moldy environment , " said @entity38 , whose group relies solely on donations and grants			1
" we 've provided in - home tutoring , light cleaning , translation and transportation support , counseling , access to medical care , financial assistance and food resources			1
" we 've donated computers and printers			0
and slow cookers , as we 've had several fires in homes where children are cooking for their families			1
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity195 @entity38 knows the toll that caring for a loved one can take			1
as an 11 - year - old , she cared for her grandfather until his death two years later			0
she remembers waking up at 2 a.m. to give him his medication and finding that he had died			0
" i do n't think i realized he was going to die			0
no one prepared me for that , " she said			0
" it was very traumatic			0
but way back then , nobody really appreciated the trauma or the impact of losing someone			0
" @entity38 became a registered nurse in 1967 and has worked in @entity1 's health - care community for decades			1
over the years , she has witnessed how technological advances have affected aging baby boomers and their families			1
" people are living longer , " she said			1
" we have much more technology and electronics that are available			0
... more and more people who maybe yesterday would 've been in a nursing home are being cared for at home			1
and so that puts a burden on a family			1
" the hospital is in a unique situation			0
... technically , they 're supposed to be able to give instruction to a caregiver			0
but sometimes that caregiver is a child			0
" the tasks can be sophisticated , too , from monitoring respiratory devices to cleaning catheters and preparing syringes			0
and not all of the children are caring for just one parent like @entity3			1
others have to care for multiple family members , including siblings			1
a report released in 2005 ( @entity60 ) by the @entity241 for @entity36 and the @entity242 said there were at least 1.3 million caregiving youths , ages 8 to 18 , nationwide			0
it 's a population that has been virtually hidden for several reasons , including the reluctance of many sick parents to go public with their infirmity			2
" parents are embarrassed to tell school members , or the principal , that they have medical problems			2
... their pride goes out the window , and most feel more vulnerable , " @entity10 said			0
children also fear trouble for themselves and for their families			2
while they might know that too many truancies and absences could land them in court , they 're often more fearful that a parent could be deemed incapacitated and the family split up			2
" children are afraid to reach out because they do n't want to be taken away from the parent , " @entity10 said			2
and people do n't want to be near you when you have an illness			2
it 's just as hard on the disabled parent as it is the child , to open up			2
that 's why it 's kept like under the table			0
" @entity38 and her group are determined to create other options and provide other solutions			2
she says the first step is acknowledging youth caregivers and telling them they are not alone			1
" we have definitely turned around lives and kept kids in school because they feel valued , " she said			0
" they never knew anyone noticed or cared			0
" it can turn their frustration and anger and flip it around to feel valued and supported in the role they are having for the family as well as society			2
if they were n't doing some of the things they are doing , who would be ? " want to get involved ? check out the @entity35 of @entity36 website at @entity302 and see how to help .			0
