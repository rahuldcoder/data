the unsolicited bibles sent by a church in the @entity15 were confiscated about a year ago at @entity11 in @entity6 because military rules forbid troops of any religion from proselytizing while deployed there , lt. col. @entity12 said			1
such religious outreach can endanger @entity15 troops and civilians in the devoutly @entity24 nation , @entity12 said			2
" the decision was made that it was a ' force protection ' measure to throw them away , because , if they did get out , it could be perceived by @entity6 that the @entity15 government or the @entity15 military was trying to convert @entity24 , " @entity12 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
troops at posts in war zones are required to burn their trash , @entity12 said			0
the bibles were written in the languages @entity37 and @entity38			0
this decision came to light recently , after the @entity41 network aired video of a group prayer service and chapel sermon that a reporter said suggested @entity15 troops were being encouraged to spread @entity47			2
the military denied that earlier this month , saying much in the video was taken out of context			0
" this was irresponsible and dangerous journalism sensationalizing year - old footage of a religious service for @entity15 soldiers on a @entity15 base and inferring that troops are evangelizing to @entity6 , " col. @entity51 said			1
the military says a soldier at @entity11 received the bibles and did n't realize he was n't allowed to hand them out			2
in the @entity41 video , which shows the @entity60 at the prayer service , an unnamed soldier says members of his church raised money for them			2
the chaplain later corrected the soldier and confiscated the @entity60 , @entity12 said			0
military officers considered sending the @entity60 back to the church , he said , but they worried the church would turn around and send them to another organization in @entity6 -- giving the impression that they had been distributed by the @entity15 government			1
that could lead to violence against troops or @entity15 civilians , @entity12 said			0
@entity41 , a @entity82 - based international news service , said its reporters tried to get a response from military officials for its story but were unable to do so			0
the @entity15 military air base at @entity11 is home to thousands of troops from all branches of the @entity15 military			1
the vast majority of the troops do not leave the base and are in various support roles for @entity15 troops across @entity6			1
