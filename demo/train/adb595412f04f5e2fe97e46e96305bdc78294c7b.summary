-- through sweat , toil and sacrifice , you built your business into a success			2
but suddenly , a horrific terrorist group emerges that calls itself the same name as your company			2
do you : a ) change the name of your business ? b ) sue the terrorist group for trademark infringement ? @entity15 ) keep your name and hope customers do n't get spooked ? businesses across the @entity19 are facing this very dilemma because the word " @entity22 " is part of their corporate name or product			1
according to the @entity29 , more than 270 products or business names among active federal trademarks use " isis			1
" they range from pharmaceutical companies to wig makers to phone apps			0
ok , so nobody is going for option " @entity35 " the most common reaction from business owners is option " a , " dropping the @entity22 reference			1
the latest and most visible example is from the hit @entity43 cartoon series , " @entity44			0
" over the weekend , the show 's creator , @entity45 , announced that the series would no longer use " @entity22 " as the acronym for the spy agency " @entity52 , " which employs the show 's main characters			1
@entity45 , who plans to come up with a story line to justify the name change for next season , commented that @entity22 is " the most awful thing and we did n't want to have anything to do with it			1
" @entity43 has even decided to stop selling @entity22 hats and shirts			1
of course , you can still get them on @entity62			0
just a few months ago , the mobile payment service known as " @entity64 , " a joint venture with @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , changed its name to " @entity70 " in order " to avoid confusion and association with a violent @entity75 militant group			0
" small businesses are also being affected			2
in @entity77 , @entity78 , the owner of the " @entity80 © " told the @entity81 that he wants to change his name but ca n't afford the costs -- a new sign , documents and all			2
this is not just an @entity19 problem			0
last week the owners of " @entity22 " in the @entity90 felt compelled to change their restaurant 's name			1
but , ok , can we all take a breath here ? both business owners and consumers			1
who actually looks at the name of a business with the word @entity22 in it and thinks : " wow , that terrorist group from the @entity102 now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood ! " or believes that a new app that helps you pay your bills is part of a terrorist group 's dastardly plan ? and , yes , i know @entity22 is a heinous organization			1
so understandably , the word @entity22 causes a negative visceral reaction			2
but we need to let fear give way to intellect and not punish @entity19 business owners			1
think of the @entity118 goddess @entity119 -- or the @entity121 song from the " @entity123 " album			0
or the 1970s children 's tv show the " @entity127 ! - @entity126			2
" the word @entity119 should conjure up mythology , not mayhem			0
perhaps an easy answer is for the media to universally start using the name isil instead of @entity22			2
( my apologies to any " @entity137 © " owners out there			0
) that would be accurate because @entity139 stands for the @entity139			0
plus president @entity140 and many media outlets already use @entity139 , including @entity142 and the @entity143			0
but what i really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the @entity148 company , @entity147 , which is keeping its name			1
as a spokesman for the drug company told @entity154 : " we 've been around for awhile			0
" people " can easily distinguish between us and a @entity102 terrorist group			0
" so my advice is , if your company or product is called @entity22 , keep the name			1
why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business ?			0

@entity166 : 270 products or businesses use " @entity22 " in their names
he asks : do you change the name because it 's *tainted* or hope customers do n't care ?
@entity166 : many business owners are dropping the reference , but why ?
he says terrorists should n't determine a company name , and people are n't that dumb
