-- thirteen people have died from consuming bacteria - tainted cantaloupe in what has become the most fatal @entity6 outbreak of a food - borne illness since 1998 , according to records from the @entity9			1
the outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported september 12 , when the @entity9 said 15 people in four states had been infected			1
the illnesses were traced to consumption of @entity18 cantaloupes grown at @entity20 ' fields in @entity21 , @entity22			1
as of monday morning , it had grown to 18 states , 72 illnesses and 13 deaths , according to the @entity9 's latest statistics			1
in 1998 , 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs , according to a @entity9 database			1
in the current outbreak , four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in @entity34 , two each in @entity22 and @entity35 , and one each in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , and @entity41			1
public health officials also have reported illnesses in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
on september 14 , @entity20 voluntarily recalled @entity18 whole cantaloupes shipped between july 29 and september 10			1
the cantaloupes were distributed in 17 states -- @entity46 , @entity53 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity35 , @entity22 , @entity59 , @entity37 , @entity34 , @entity60 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
the cantaloupes also were exported , and while the @entity9 did not name the affected countries , it said they had been notified of the recall			1
the cantaloupes may bear a green - and - white sticker that reads : product of @entity6 - @entity73 - @entity72 , or a gray , yellow , and green sticker that says : @entity77			0
many of the cantaloupes , however , will not have a label , said @entity9 director dr. @entity81			1
he urged consumers either to check for a label or ask the supermarket where the cantaloupes originated			2
" if they ca n't confirm that it 's not @entity20 , then it 's best to throw it out , " @entity81 said			1
affected cantaloupes can still pose a danger if refrigerated , he said , because @entity92 can grow even at low temperatures			2
@entity92 also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick , so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks , he said			0
@entity81 said anyone who has eaten cantaloupe and now has flu - like symptoms , including fever , should see a doctor			0
those who are older , pregnant , or have an underlying condition such as cancer should also consult their physician if they have eaten the fruit			0
@entity20 has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season , so no new contaminated melons will be entering the market , said commissioner @entity110 of the @entity111			2
the short two - week shelf - life of the fruit means any contaminated cantaloupes are being removed from store shelves anyway , @entity81 said			2
" @entity20 continues to stay committed to the highest levels of food safety and maintains many third - party safety audits , as we have for many years , " said @entity119 , a partner at @entity20			2
" we continually look for ways to enhance our protocol			0
" @entity73 , the supplier , issued a statement september 14 saying it was " working with @entity111 and state health officials to determine where along the supply chain the @entity92 contamination may have occurred			0
" the 1998 outbreak in tainted hotdogs sickened 101 people and left 21 dead , according to the @entity9 's @entity130			1
listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms			0
it is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults , according to the @entity9 , but it is particularly dangerous for older adults , people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women , in whom it can cause miscarriages , stillbirth and premature delivery , or bring on a life - threatening infection in a newborn			2
about 1,600 people become seriously ill because of the bacteria each year , the @entity9 reports , and about 260 die			2
four families affected by the outbreak have filed lawsuits , said attorney @entity155 , who is representing them			1
the suits include two in @entity22 , one in @entity35 and one in @entity41			2
a fifth will be filed this week in @entity38 , @entity155 said			0
the cases in @entity41 and @entity38 involve relatives of people who have died in the outbreak , @entity155 said			0
the other cases involve people who have been sickened			0
at least 10 other people have retained @entity155 's firm , he said			0
@entity20 and @entity73 are listed as the defendants in the lawsuits			1
an attorney for @entity20 and an official with @entity73 did not immediately return calls from @entity0 for comment wednesday			0
@entity155 said the opportunity to " put people under oath and have subpoena power " allows information to come to light about how such an outbreak happens			0
the @entity9 's @entity81 said that because of budget reductions in the past two years , 44,000 fewer people are working at state and local health agencies , which means it can take more time to identify an outbreak			0
@entity155 said he expects a court in @entity22 to issue an order within days allowing his legal team to go onto the farm and the processing facility			0
" my obligation is to try to figure out a way to compensate people who have gone through what these people have gone through , " he said .			0
