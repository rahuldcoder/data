, a ratio of height to weight , to categorize people as overweight and obese			0
a new study , however , suggests the use of @entity4 may be leading us to underestimate the already sky - high obesity rate			2
@entity4 , the researchers say , is an overly simplistic measure that often misrepresents physical fitness and overall health , especially among older women			1
nearly 4 in 10 adults whose @entity4 places them in the overweight category would be considered obese if their body fat percentage were taken into account , according to the study			1
" some people call it the ' baloney mass index , ' " says lead author @entity25 , @entity26 , president of the @entity27 , a nonprofit organization in @entity28 dedicated to brain research			0
bodybuilders can be classified as obese based on their @entity4 , he says , while " a 55 - year - old woman who looks great in a dress could have very little muscle and mostly body fat , and a whole lot of health risks because of that -- but still have a normal @entity4			1
" @entity0 : surprising celebrity @entity41 based on their findings , @entity25 and his coauthor , @entity47 @entity46 , @entity26 , say the @entity4 threshold for obesity , which now stands at 30 , should be lowered to 24 for women and 28 for men			1
by that standard , a 5 - foot 6 - inch woman and a 5 - foot 11 - inch man would be considered obese at about 150 and 200 pounds , respectively			1
the study participants -- patients at a specialized private health clinic in @entity57 -- are n't typical of the population as a whole , @entity25 notes			2
still , he says , the large discrepancy between @entity4 and body fat measures seen in the study suggest that @entity4 guidelines should be revisited			0
" people are n't being diagnosed [ as obese ] , so they 're not being told about their risk of disease or being given instruction on how to improve their health , " says @entity25 , who is also a clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery at @entity65 , in @entity28			1
@entity0 : best superfoods for weight loss @entity73 , @entity26 , chief of noncommunicable diseases at the @entity75 , a division of the @entity76 based in @entity77 , says that while one study is not enough to justify changing national standards , the findings do call for a discussion			0
" we 've known for a long time that @entity4 is not a perfect measurement , and that it 's important to look at the overall picture , " @entity73 says			0
" in this study , it turns out that a lot of people who are classified as just overweight in fact have a bit more to worry about , and those are indeed valuable findings			0
" but lowering the cutoff for obesity could create its own problems , @entity92 adds			0
" we 'd also be calling an increasing number of people obese who are n't , which could lead to issues with stigma , insurance policies , and other problems , " he says			0
" we have to think quite carefully about the pros and cons. " @entity0 : can you be fit and fat ? in the study , published today in the journal @entity108 , @entity25 and @entity46 compared the @entity4 of roughly 1,400 men and women with their body fat percentage , which was measured using a type of scan , known as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( @entity116 ) , that provides a detailed breakdown of fat , muscle , and bone mass. ( @entity116 scans are also used to measure bone density			1
) overall , 39 % of patients who were merely overweight by @entity4 standards fell into the obese category for body fat percentage , which the @entity127 defines as 25 % or more for men and 30 % or more for women			1
@entity4 appeared to provide a far less accurate picture among women , possibly because women lose muscle mass faster than men as they age , the study notes			1
nearly half of the women were considered obese according to body fat percentage but not @entity4 , compared to just one - quarter of the men			1
@entity0 : mistakes women make in middle age testing for blood levels of the hormone leptin could boost the usefulness of @entity4 , the study suggests			2
@entity147 , which helps regulate energy and appetite , was strongly associated with body fat percentage in the study , and it has previously been linked to obesity - related health complications			0
adjusting @entity4 to account for leptin levels would provide patients with a more accurate measure of their disease risk , @entity25 says			2
lowering @entity4 obesity cutoffs , using @entity116 scans when possible , and incorporating leptin tests represents a " three - pronged approach , " @entity25 says			2
" making these changes now can save the @entity162 a fortune down the road , if it allows us to alert more people to their risks and prevent them from getting worse			0

@entity4 , researchers say , may be an overly simplistic measure for overall health
@entity4 threshold for obesity should be lowered to 24 for women and 28 for men , authors say
authors : patients who are not considered obese are n't being told about their health risks
