-- @entity2 failed to identify himself twice during a confrontation with @entity4 and missed opportunities to defuse the situation that led to the death of the teen , a detective says in a newly released report			1
@entity2 , who served as a neighborhood watch volunteer , is charged with second - degree murder in the february 26 shooting death of @entity4 , 17 , in @entity13 , @entity14			0
the report is part of information @entity14 prosecutors released tuesday			0
it includes a previously undisclosed portion of a video of @entity2 showing injuries he said he suffered in the altercation with @entity4			2
@entity2 , 28 , told police he shot the teenager in self - defense and has pleaded not guilty			2
but @entity4 's family and civil rights activists have said @entity2 , who is white and @entity29 , racially profiled @entity4 and ignored a 911 dispatcher 's advice not to follow him			2
among the documents released was a report from an officer who conducted computerized voice stress analysis tests on @entity2			1
timeline of events in @entity4 case " mr. @entity2 was subjected to two exams , and was found to be classified as @entity41 , " the report said			2
also released tuesday was an unredacted capias request , a request that someone be taken into custody , prepared by the lead police investigator in the case , @entity45			1
" investigative findings show that ( @entity2 ) had at least two opportunities to speak with ( @entity4 ) in order to defuse the circumstances surrounding their encounter , " @entity45 wrote in the report			0
" on at least two occasions ( @entity2 ) failed to identify himself as a concerned resident or a neighborhood watch volunteer			0
" the detective also said @entity2 's actions " are inconsistent with those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject			1
" in the same report , @entity45 wrote that @entity2 's injuries were " marginally consistent with a life - threatening violent episode as described by him			1
" @entity2 's defense attorney , @entity65 , filed a motion wednesday asking that his client be allowed to appear at a friday bond hearing in " civilian clothing instead of a prison uniform and without restraints			1
" video and photos of @entity2 shackled and wearing jail garb could prejudice prospective jurors , @entity65 said			0
in response to the document release , @entity65 said tuesday it will be up to a judge and jury to interpret what @entity45 's report means to the case			2
" i do n't want to get into a battle with investigator @entity45 's report considering what he believed after it seems he made the decision that charges should be filed , " he said			0
" his suggestion that it 's marginally consistent , again , is up for review			0
those people will have to look at it , whether it 'd be @entity94 in a motion hearing where the jury will also make that determination , whether or not those injuries give rise to a reasonable belief in @entity2 's mind that he was a victim of great bodily injury or potential death			1
" @entity4 's family attorney , @entity104 , said he agrees with the detective 's assertion			2
" the lead detective made the determination at least on two different occasions @entity2 had opportunity to defuse the situation			1
when he got out the car , he could have at least said , ' i 'm a neighborhood watch volunteer ' to defuse the situation and it 's likely @entity4 would be living today , " @entity104 said			0
@entity2 : @entity4 threatened my life also released tuesday was a previously undisclosed portion of a video re-enactment of the incident that police taped a day after the shooting			1
in the video , @entity2 , bandages on his head , talks about how his wife is treating his injuries			0
" i have a broken nose			0
she says i could use stitches , but she 'd rather not put them in -- as long as i did n't mess with my head			0
my skin is already healing nicely , " @entity2 said			0
also tuesday , the @entity134 announced that @entity45 had " voluntarily " asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer			1
@entity137 sgt. @entity137 said the change is not a demotion and he said he did not know why @entity45 requested the move			0
@entity104 said the move was clearly a demotion			0
" the lead detective today got demoted and that 's one of those things we have to question			1
he told what he thought was the truth , " @entity104 said			0
@entity2 had been released on bond after his arrest			1
but he was ordered back to jail this month after a @entity14 judge revoked his bail , citing about $ 150,000 in donations in an account controlled by @entity2 that he had not disclosed at the april 20 bond hearing			1
@entity65 is asking @entity94 , a @entity158 judge , to set a bond similar to the $ 150,000 bond initially granted @entity2 , arguing that he poses no danger to the community , is not a flight risk , and " cooperated fully " with police before his arrest			1
