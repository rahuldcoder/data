@entity0 -- its boss the butt of late - night jokes and its conduct the target of president @entity8 's ire , @entity2 went into a june meeting at the @entity11 with its future at stake			1
" the confidence of the markets had been rattled , " former @entity2 ceo @entity14 said in his first interview since he resigned , indicating how close the company was to collapse			1
oil was still flowing from its well in the @entity21 and the company was being hit financially on all sides , with its stock price down and demands increasing for it to suspend dividend payments			2
eleven lives had been lost on the @entity29 rig and @entity31 residents were feeling the punch of the disaster			2
" these were frightening days , " current boss @entity34 told the @entity35 , which aired " @entity2 : $ 30 billion blowout " on tuesday			1
" it was a very , very tense period			0
" @entity2 emerged from the @entity11 with an agreement to spend $ 20 billion in reparations over four years and for politicians to tone down the @entity43 rhetoric			1
@entity14 told the @entity35 the company was " not prepared " for the fallout from the spill and that he understood why he was " demonized and vilified " by the @entity48 public			1
" it is very difficult to hate a company , " said @entity14 , conceding @entity2 contingency plans were inadequate			1
" it 's much easier to hate an individual			0
" @entity14 made a series of ill - advised remarks during the crisis , including , " i would like my life back			1
" @entity48 politicians and officials castigated him and occasionally referred to the company as " @entity2 " rather than as " @entity2 , " underscoring that a foreign - based company was at fault for the disaster			1
" i do n't feel like i 've been made a scapegoat , i recognized the realities of the world we live in , " @entity14 told the @entity35			1
" in some senses it comes with the patch and you simply have to take the rough with the smooth			0
" @entity14 said the company can restore the environment and jobs , but not the lives of those who died on the @entity29			1
" i was and remain devastated , he said			0
" i feel a real accountability for that			0
" the @entity35 program was aired on the second day of @entity48 hearings about the @entity21 oil spill			2
one bad decision after another , failed tests and other shortfalls show that the three companies involved in the disaster need to be overhauled , the co-chairman of the presidential commission investigating the incident said			1
" @entity2 , @entity99 , and @entity100 are major respected companies operating throughout the @entity21 , " said @entity92 , former administrator of the @entity94 , " and the evidence is that they are in need of top - to - bottom reform			1
" referencing his own earlier remarks about " culture of complacency , " @entity92 said , " all three companies we heard from displayed it , " @entity92 said			2
on monday , the commission reported that workers aboard the @entity29 were pushing to complete the well , but no " conscious decision " to cut corners on safety had been discovered			0
" presentations and examinations yesterday uncovered a suite of bad decisions , " @entity92 said			0
@entity118 co-chairman @entity117 , a former @entity48 senator from @entity119 , cited a culture that failed to ensure safety			1
" leaders did not take serious risk seriously enough , did not identify risk that proved to be fatal , " @entity117 said tuesday			0
tuesday 's hearing focused on regulations and well - drilling protocols			0
the disaster began april 20 with an explosion aboard the @entity29 drill rig , which was completing the well for @entity2 at the time of the blast			1
the 11 killed all died in the blast and fire , which raged for two days before the rig sank , rupturing the well a mile below			0
@entity100 , the rig 's owner , @entity99 , the cement contractor , and @entity2 have pointed fingers at each other since the rig sank			1
@entity2 was responsible for capping the ruptured well it owned and cleaning up the more than 200 million gallons of oil that spilled			1
the well was sealed temporarily in @entity145 and capped permanently on september 19			0
" there seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that april 19 , april 20 time period , " @entity117 said monday			0
@entity92 also cited a " rush to completion " and called @entity2 and its partners " laggards " in following best practices for drilling			1
tuesday 's testimony included discussion on @entity2 's plan to temporarily cap the well before another rig would move in to start collecting oil			1
@entity162 , well engineering scientist , said his company uses at least three plugs during such a process , as compared to @entity2 's one			2
the director of a petroleum research laboratory at @entity168 testified that better training and drills could prepare rig workers for disasters			0
" i definitely think an increase in training should be considered , particularly with a set of disaster scenarios , if you will , " said @entity173			2
" i think it would probably be much more effective if [ training ] drills were regularly conducted along these lines on the rigs that were doing the operations with the crews			0
" the commission also heard from @entity185 about its safety programs			0
its executive said the company learned some lessons from the 1989 @entity190 in @entity191 and other situations			0
" @entity185 's goal is not simply to have employees comply with safety procedures			0
a culture of compliance alone can lead to complacency , " said @entity196 , chairman and chief executive officer			2
" we seek to go beyond compliance , to create a culture in which employees are not only meeting the safety procedures , but they are challenging them so they can be improved where needed			0
" @entity2 and @entity99 have drawn criticism about flaws in cement that was poured to reinforce the well			2
the companies involved each had data , " commission chief engineer @entity215 testified tuesday			2
" and if data had been shared differently and if operations had been carried out differently , i believe this disaster could have been prevented			2
" @entity1 's @entity220 contributed to this report .			0
