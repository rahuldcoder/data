@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 -- the first named storm of the @entity6 hurricane season this year -- formed in the @entity7 on saturday as @entity8 continued to battle a massive oil spill in the @entity10			1
@entity3 had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 kph ) and was about 250 miles away from @entity12 , @entity13			1
it was moving toward @entity15 and over the @entity16			0
it was not clear whether the storm could hit the part of the @entity10 affected by the massive oil spill that has been gushing since the @entity22 rig exploded april 20 , killing 11 workers			1
a tropical storm in the oil - tainted @entity10 would disrupt @entity8 efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea			1
it would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline			0
high winds and seas could distribute the oil -- still gushing from a blown deepwater well -- over a wider area while storm surges could wash more oil ashore , according to a fact sheet prepared by the @entity41			1
a tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast of @entity15 , the east coast of the @entity16 of @entity13 , and various islands of @entity47			1
it means storm conditions are expected within the warning area within 36 hours			1
meteorologist @entity51 says the " preferred scenario " actually would be for the storm to head to northern @entity53			1
that 's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise			1
if the storm heads to the east of it , it would send the oil farther out to sea			1
if the storm heads more directly towards the central @entity10 and @entity1 , it might push the oil toward @entity53			1
of course , forecasting where oil spills are headed in not easy			1
" we 're really in unchartered territory , " @entity51 said			0
" we 've never been in this situation before			0
we 've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the @entity10 like this , end up so close to shore			1
" she noted that the latest models do point to the storm heading to the central @entity10			1
@entity78 adm. @entity77 , who 's heading the federal cleanup operation , says he 'll have to redeploy people and equipment to safer areas 120 hours ( five days ) in advance of gale - force winds			0
and he agreed there is " no playbook " when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews			1
" but i will tell you there 's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done , " he told @entity2			0
" we are going to try to merge two response structures			0
one has proven effective in the past , and that 's a central coordination of search and rescue and how operations are conducted , and that 's done out of @entity101 in @entity53 for hurricanes			0
and we are in the process of integrating our planning processes so the oil spill response is integrated fully within the search and rescue recovery operations			1
" but a powerful storm would not just disrupt efforts to drill relief wells and capture the oil at sea , of course			1
it would complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline			0
" it 's going to mean we 're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources , change things , " said @entity116 , chairman of the @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity53			0
" we wo n't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days			1
and we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf			2
so obviously , it 's a very big concern for us			0
" @entity77 said he and some top @entity133 administration officials , including vice president @entity134 , will be headed back to the @entity135 next week to assess the oil relief efforts			2
but in a new blow to fishermen , @entity138 officials announced that waters east of the @entity143 shipping channel would be closed to shrimping , because of oil sighted in the area			2
meanwhile , there been some promising news for potentially tens of thousands of people seeking claims against @entity8			0
@entity151 , who is administering the $ 20 billion fund set up by @entity8 under @entity154 prodding , says that people who work in support of oil rigs will be able to file claims -- and not just fishermen and businesses along the coast			2
employees of businesses that brings tools to oil rigs , for example , also would be able to file a claim			2
the company previously agreed to set aside the $ 20 billion in an escrow account for spill - related costs , a sum that does not cover fees and penalties that could be imposed by the federal government			2
@entity8 had resisted approving claims by people who said they were affected by the moratorium on oil drilling , saying it was imposed by the @entity133 administration			1
but @entity151 said @entity8 and the administration now have agreed those claims will be covered			0
" i now have discovered -- i did n't realize this until yesterday , but the moratorium claims will fall under my jurisdiction , " he told @entity2			2
to date , almost 74,000 claims have been filed and more than 39,000 payments have been made , totaling almost $ 126 million , according to the company			0
in another development , there has been some promising news in the effort to permanently stop the leak			0
@entity8 said friday its " ranging " process , by which it sends an electrical current that puts out an electromagnetic field down the well bore , detected wednesday where the leaking well is in relation to the first relief well , at a depth of 16,275 feet			0
@entity8 said subsequent ranging runs will be needed to more precisely locate the leaking well and figure out how to best intersect the two			0
" what they will do is continue to drill down in short intervals , withdraw the pipe , put that sensing device down and slowly close on the well bore to the point where they 're ready to do the intercept drilling			2
this last part takes some time because they only do several hundred feet at a time			2
" they 'll also have a vessel standing by full of mud on the top , so in the event there were to get really close and potentially nick the well bore , they could actually put the mud down to control any hydrocarbons that might come out			0
" drilling and ranging operations will continue over the next few weeks toward the target intercept depth of approximately 18,000 feet			2
" @entity226 " operations are expected to begin when the relief well reaches the leaking well			0
@entity8 said drilling also continues on a second relief well , which has reached 10,500 feet			2
costs associated with the @entity10 oil disaster have gone up more than $ 300 million in less than a week , @entity8 said friday			1
" the cost of the response to date amounts to approximately $ 2.35 billion , including the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to the @entity241 , claims paid and federal costs , " a company statement said			1
@entity8 put the tab at $ 2 billion on monday			0
meanwhile , deepwater drilling could resume by the end of july			2
@entity248 district judge @entity247 in @entity0 , @entity1 , on thursday denied a request to keep a six - month moratorium imposed by president @entity133 on may 27 in place , pending a government appeal			0
the government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with @entity247 's order and start issuing permits			0
the appeals process can continue , but until the appeal , the government must act as if @entity247 's order will be upheld			0
@entity247 turned down the government 's request for a stay of his order late thursday , and the @entity263 appealed that ruling to the 5th @entity264 in @entity0			1
government lawyers filed an appeal to the @entity264 friday , asking the court to stay @entity247 's order pending the appeals			1
@entity2 's @entity269 contributed to this report			0
