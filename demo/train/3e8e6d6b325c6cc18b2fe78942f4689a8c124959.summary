-- even if you know nothing about @entity4 or @entity5 , the odds are you know the name @entity8			1
the trailblazing racecar driver has been exposed to a global audience through @entity12 commercials , modeling shoots and other mainstream partnerships			0
she 's helped @entity15 and @entity5 spread their audiences beyond core racing fans			1
that brand awareness has n't been lost in the video game space			1
a few years ago @entity20 worked with @entity21 to promote its racing game , " @entity23			1
" and she is one of the featured drivers in both of @entity21 's licensed @entity5 console games			1
now she 's partnered with @entity27 for its new arcade racing game , " @entity29			1
" gamers can race @entity20 's converting vehicle -- it flies , drives and floats -- against popular @entity27 characters like @entity29 , @entity36 and dr. @entity35			1
gamers can even put her up against @entity38 's @entity39 for a virtual race			1
@entity20 , who was recently named @entity42 's most popular driver by @entity5 fans , took some time to play the new @entity27 game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for @entity0			1
how big of a gamer were growing up and what did you play ? i played a lot of games growing up , as any kid naturally would do			1
" i played " @entity55 " i played any kind of racing game that existed , i played " @entity58			1
" i shot some ducks with " @entity60			0
" do you have a favorite @entity29 memory from back then that you can share with us ? can anyone really remember that far back ? i think more than anything what i remember is playing the games when i would be on the road racing go karts , and being in my van when i went to the track with my family and playing with my friends at the track			1
i remember the places more than i remember exact memories about the games			1
what 's it like being featured in " @entity29 ? " it 's really neat to be a player in it , especially being such a famous game , such an iconic game			1
being able to be able to be a player along with @entity85 and all the other @entity86 is very flattering and it 's very cool			1
how does this compare to seeing yourself in @entity5 games ? @entity5 seems like it 's kind of a shoe - in for me			1
so to be in something like a @entity27 game is to me more cool because it 's something that 's not common , and it 's not given that i would be in those games			1
so i actually like it better			0
what tips or strategies would you give to anyone who is going to play " @entity29 ? " my suggestion would be to first off , pick me to play me because i 'll be a really good one to choose			1
i 'll be fast and i have lots of skills and talents and i shoot balls of flames			0
it disables cars and allows you to be able to get by them			0
i think you need to find out for yourself how awesome i am in the game			1
how popular are video games in @entity5 ? video games are pretty popular , for sure			2
i think given the fact that we 're in a racing environment , racing games tend to be something that 's obviously really common , so growing up i 've played them and some people continue to play them and i think it 's a good fit			1
what games are popular on the field these days during the rain delays ? i know a lot of drivers play @entity130 , which is more of an online thing			1
what impact do you think the hand - eye coordination required in video games has helped drivers become better in real racing ? playing games and being an adult race car driver , i think it 's more of a mental thing			1
if you think it helps you then it does , but i do n't know			0
i need to feel the g - forces			0
for me , it 's more about having fun outside of the car than it is about actually helping to be able to drive it			2
if that was the case , then everyone would just play games			2
and that 's not a prerequisite to driving a race car			1
do you think that racing simulators help @entity5 drivers at all ? i do think that they can			2
i think that when you take it to the next level and these simulators that cost millions of dollars , i think they can be helpful			0
i 've tried them , but there 's nothing like the real thing			2
i know @entity167 teams tend to do that quite a bit			0
it 's not prevalent here in the @entity172 with @entity5 or @entity15 , so i do n't			2
but if it 's in your head that it 's going to help you to play a simulator or play a racing game , then it will help			1
do you have a favorite piece of technology that you ca n't live without ? well , that 's the phone			2
i mean let 's face it			2
what the heck did we do before cell phones ? half of all gamers today are female			2
how have you seen video games evolve to become more than something just guys play ? well , they 're very visual			2
that 's one thing that 's for sure			2
they 're visually really amazing , so i think that maybe that might appeal to the female eye			0
we kind of tend to be about appearance a little bit			2
i think it also is about being able to have fun , and the games just get better and better over time			2
we just waited till the games got better			2
a lot of @entity27 's classic @entity29 games are now on the latest tablets			1
what are your thoughts on these new gaming devices out there ? technology always is just fast forwarding			0
there are more easy ways for people to be able to play the games that they want to play , when they want to play them			2
that 's just the day and age we 're living in			0
do you think we 'll see more of you in future games ? i guess we 'll have to talk about that ? i do n't know			0
maybe i could be a stable player			0
is this where we 're going with it ? i 'd like to think so			0
that would be pretty cool			0
how many different cars do you have for the track and how many cars do you have at home ? with all the race teams i drive for and the different series i drive in , i have a lot of race cars at the track			1
there are always two per series that are at the track for me , but then there are lots of them back at the race shop being built , or ready to go to the next event , especially if it 's a different style track like a short track or a big superspeedway or road course			1
there are lots of different cars having to do with racing			0
at home i do n't have that many			0
honestly , i only need two			0
i have a nice fancy car , and i have a daily driver			0
i do n't need any more			0
to be honest , i give away a lot of my cars			0
but i did buy a couple of my race cars , so i do have a couple of those			0
what type of communication goes on inside a real race car ? if you 're listening on the radio to the race , you 're going to hear a lot of spot reaction about where cars are and things like that			1
i trash talk in my mind for sure , but i 've been warned not to say it out loud because then everyone can hear , including kids , so i try and be polite and nice			0
it 's not always going to happen			0
you definitely get frustrated with drivers , you want to get by them and you 're trying to -- and you get mad and sometimes you want to crash them			0
all those things are real and that happens in the game , too			0
it 's just that you actually get to do it and it does n't cost any money to crash the car			0
that 's the wonderful world of fantasy .			0
