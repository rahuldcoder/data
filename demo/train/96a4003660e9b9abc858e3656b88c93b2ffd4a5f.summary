-- late goals from @entity2 and @entity3 gave @entity5 champions @entity4 a 4 - 2 win over promoted @entity7 at @entity8 wednesday			1
the hard - fought victory put @entity4 top of the early standings in the @entity12 with two wins from two games			1
but they were made to work hard by the battling visitors , who led 2 - 1 deep into the second half after @entity19 had put the home side ahead with an 18th - minute penalty			2
@entity4 's new signing @entity23 was again influential , winning a penalty after being pulled down by defender @entity25			0
veteran midfielder @entity19 easily beat @entity26 and last season 's @entity28 winners looked set for a comfortable victory			0
are footballers on a par with bankers ? but in a dramatic turnaround , @entity35 international @entity34 -- who played for @entity36 in the @entity12 last season -- leveled with a firm header from a @entity41 cross before the visitors went ahead as @entity44 's free kick found its way past @entity46			0
it was a soft goal to concede by the home goalkeeper , but midway through the second half @entity4 were level after an even worse blunder by @entity26			0
he allowed a speculative long - range effort from defender @entity52 to go under his body , similar to his mistake in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity56 in @entity7 's @entity12 opener on saturday			1
@entity4 pushed forward in search of a winner , but there was an element of fortune when @entity2 struck from close range as replays appeared to indicate the @entity66 winner was offside as he received a pass from @entity69 defender @entity68 in the 81st minute			2
@entity26 's miserable evening was complete when the @entity70 came up for a corner in injury time , but it was cleared quickly and @entity2 then hazard set up @entity3 for the clinching fourth goal			0
the three points put @entity77 's men top of the @entity12 table for the first time since november 2010 after a fixture brought forward due to @entity4 's involvement in the @entity82 , where they will play @entity85 's @entity84 winners @entity83 in @entity86 on friday			1
meanwhile , troubled @entity85 club @entity87 took a step nearer their first appearance in the @entity28 group stage with a 2 - 0 win over @entity92 of @entity93 in the first leg of their final qualifier			1
@entity87 saw several top players depart in the close season but @entity100 's men were too good for their @entity93 visitors with first - half goals from @entity104 defender @entity103 and @entity106 winger @entity105			2
cypriot side @entity107 will take a 2 - 1 lead over @entity110 of @entity111 into the second leg , while @entity114 's @entity113 lead @entity115 of @entity116 by the same score			0
@entity119 side @entity118 were 2 - 0 winners against @entity121 of @entity122 , while a superb goal from @entity124 earned a 1 - 1 home draw for @entity127 's @entity126 against @entity129 visitors @entity128 , who had led through @entity131 .			1

@entity4 beat @entity7 4 - 2 at @entity8 to go top of @entity12
two wins from two games for *reigning* @entity5 champions
@entity2 and @entity3 with late goals for @entity4
