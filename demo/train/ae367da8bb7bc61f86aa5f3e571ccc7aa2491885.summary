@entity1 , @entity0 -- news that a @entity5 soldier died after he received the cancerous lungs of a heavy smoker has sparked intense debate as to whether organs from people with unhealthy lifestyles should be used in transplants			1
surgeons " are n't in a position in to turn down organs because they 're not absolutely perfect			1
" corporal @entity16 , 31 , died in 2008 , less than a year after receiving a transplant at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity0			1
however a transplant surgeon has told @entity2 that smokers organs will continue to be used as long as medical services face a severe shortage of organs			1
@entity25 , vice president of the @entity26 , told @entity2 that 49 percent of last year 's lung donors in the @entity5 were smokers			1
" we 're not in the luxurious position in transplantation to turn down organs because they 're not absolutely perfect -- there are very few perfect organs , " he said			1
what should be done to encourage organ donation ? " in the case of corporal @entity16 the donor had a chest x-ray , broncoscopy and a careful inspection of the lungs once they were removed , " he said			0
" when they found the tumor in corporal @entity47 it was seven millimeters across and it was likely to have been two or three millimeters when it was transplanted			1
to find something that small you 'd need to chop the lungs up into fine pieces , and then you ca n't transplant			2
" the @entity5 @entity54 and @entity55 ( @entity56 ) recently released an alert saying it had found 11 reported incidents " relating to the condition of an organ for transplant or other errors			1
" one incident reported to the @entity56 read : " kidney arrived completely surrounded by fat and muscle -- nothing was recognizable			0
after dissection , a fatty tumor appeared on the upper pole , decision was taken to transplant anyway			1
" after unclamping , there was a massive bleed from the tumor leading to urgent transplantectomy -- kidney sent to the path lab -- renal cell carcinoma ... not fit for purpose			2
" @entity25 told @entity2 that organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before they are transplanted			1
he said that once a patient has been diagnosed as brain dead and donation is a possibility , a donor coordinator will approach their family to learn more about the patient 's history			2
medics ask about the donor 's medical history and lifestyle			2
they also take a blood test and may contact the donor 's doctor for more information			2
but @entity25 stresses that medics only have a few hours between diagnosis of brain death and organ removal			0
when the organs are removed the donor 's body is examined for evidence of infection , cancer , or anything else that might affect decision to use an organ			1
in the case of lung transplants , the donor will have a chest x-ray and broncoscopy , where an endoscope is used to examine lungs from the inside			2
" the main thing is how well lungs work , " @entity25 told @entity2			0
" we would check blood gases , taking a blood sample and seeing how much oxygen is dissolved in the blood to see how well lungs are working			0
" if they work well and there 's no evidence of any problems then we would use them , regardless of if they came from a smoker			0
" @entity25 says a biopsy is carried out on donated livers to check for any damage			0
he says fatty livers are common , not because the donor is overweight , but as a result of the donor having been starved in intensive care			0
different organs have different tolerances to being without a blood supply			0
@entity25 says a heart does n't respond well to being out of the body for more than three or four hours			0
livers can remain viable for around 12 hours and kidneys for about 24 hours			0
those time constraints mean medics have to make quick judgments about the suitability of donated organs , even if it that means using imperfect organs			1
" we 're happy to use the organs available knowing they 're not ideal and we 'll make the best use of them and keep them functioning as well as we can , " said @entity25			0
" the alternative for recipients is to die , so there 's really not much choice for them			0

@entity169 says shortage of donors mean they must use imperfect organs
49 percent of last year 's lung donors in the @entity5 were smokers
@entity178 data *suggest* one in *5,000* donated organs may have a tumor
organs are thoroughly tested for suitability before transplant , says surgeon
