-- in a new report , the @entity2 @entity1 predicts the winding down of " @entity5 " and @entity7 's ascent as the world 's top economy by 2030			1
that is , unless several " @entity12 " events skew their predictions			1
on monday , the report " @entity14 : @entity23 " forecast that @entity2 economic and international influence will decline in the next two decades as a shift of global power moves from the @entity19 to the @entity20 , and from the @entity21 to the @entity22			1
the relative importance of the @entity2 as a global actor will decrease , as its economy and that of its western allies will decline			1
meanwhile , rising states such as @entity7 , @entity30 and other @entity32 nations will contribute an increasingly large share of global financial growth			1
" with the rapid rise of other countries , the ' unipolar moment ' is over , and ' @entity5 ' -- the era of @entity2 ascendancy in international politics that began in 1945 -- is fast winding down , " the report states			1
however , despite a weaker economy , the @entity2 will probably remain " first among equals , " the report says , adding that it is very unlikely that any other nation could replace the @entity2 as the leading world power			1
the report is largely optimistic about technological and economic advances in the next two decades			2
the numbers of people living in poverty is likely to drop sharply in @entity20 and @entity50 , the @entity51 and @entity52 , with @entity53 lagging behind			0
" under most scenarios -- except the most dire -- significant strides in reducing extreme poverty will be achieved by 2030 , " the report notes			2
what are those dire scenarios ? the report gives a list of eight " @entity12 " scenarios -- a reference to @entity63 's book " @entity12 , " which posits that history is built on unforeseeable , surprise events			1
global trends 2030 's potential @entity67 1			1
@entity68 " no one can predict which pathogen will be the next to start spreading to humans , or when or where such a development will occur , " the report says			2
" such an outbreak could result in millions of people suffering and dying in every corner of the world in less than six months			0
much more @entity79 " dramatic and unforeseen changes already are occurring at a faster rate than expected			0
most scientists are not confident of being able to predict such events			2
rapid changes in precipitation patterns — such as monsoons in @entity30 and the rest of @entity50 -- could sharply disrupt that region 's ability to feed its population			0
@entity92 / @entity91 collapse if @entity95 were to leave the euro zone in an unruly way , it could result in eight times the collateral damage as the @entity100 bankruptcy , which could lead to a broader crisis in the @entity91 in the future , the report says			0
a @entity103 or collapsed @entity7 " @entity7 is slated to pass the threshold of us $ 15,000 per capita purchasing power parity ( @entity107 ) in the next five years or so — a level that is often a trigger for democratization , " the report notes			1
" @entity7 ` soft ' power could be dramatically boosted , setting off a wave of democratic movements			2
alternatively , many experts believe a democratic @entity7 could also become more nationalistic			2
an economically collapsed @entity7 would trigger political unrest and shock the global economy			1
a @entity116 " a more liberal regime could come under growing public pressure to end the international sanctions and negotiate an end to @entity116 's isolation			0
an @entity116 that dropped its nuclear weapons aspirations and became focused on economic modernization would bolster the chances for a more stable @entity51			0
@entity125 or @entity126 " nuclear powers such as @entity128 and @entity129 and potential aspirants such as @entity116 and @entity131 see nuclear weapons as compensation for other political and security weaknesses , heightening the risk of their use			0
the chance of nonstate actors conducting a cyber attack — or using @entity126 ( weapon of mass destruction ) — also is increasing			0
solar geomagnetic storms " solar geomagnetic storms could knock out satellites , the electric grid , and many sensitive electronic devices			0
the recurrence intervals of crippling solar geomagnetic storms , which are less than a century , now pose a substantial threat because of the world 's dependence on electricity , " the report says			0
@entity154 " a collapse or sudden retreat of @entity2 power probably would result in an extended period of global anarchy ; no leading power would be likely to replace the @entity2 as guarantor of the international order			1
" @entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report			0

a report predicts that @entity7 will surpass the @entity2 economy by 2030
despite a weaker economy , the @entity2 will probably remain " first among equals , " the report says
the report lists " @entity67 , " *unpredictable* events that might upend predictions
one " @entity12 " event *suggests* @entity2 *disengagement* could cause global anarchy
