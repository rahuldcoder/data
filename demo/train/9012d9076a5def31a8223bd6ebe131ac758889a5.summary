@entity0 -- after a week of deadly international protests against an anti-islam film , a @entity3 satirical magazine is pouring oil on the fiery debate between freedom of expression and offensive provocation			1
the magazine @entity11 , which is known for outrageous humor , published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the @entity15 on wednesday			2
the issue hit the stands eight days after a video mocking the @entity20 prophet triggered angry protests , including one that led to the death of the @entity26 ambassador to @entity27			1
@entity28 , director of the @entity3 magazine , said his staff is " not really fueling the fire " but rather using its freedom of expression " to comment ( on ) the news in a satirical way			1
" " it happens that the news this week is @entity15 and this lousy film , so we are drawing cartoons about this subject , " @entity28 told @entity1 affiliate @entity35 on wednesday			1
the magazine was directing its derision at " this grotesque film , " @entity28 said , not the @entity20 prophet			1
that " grotesque film " is " @entity44 , " a video that sat obscure on the internet until september 11 when rioters , seizing on it , attacked the @entity26 @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity27 , and killed @entity26 ambassador @entity51 and three other @entity26			2
protesters also breached the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , the same day , and protests over the video have erupted in at least 20 countries since then			2
there has been no violence reported as a result of the @entity11 cartoons			1
but @entity3 will close embassies and schools in about 20 countries on friday , the main @entity20 day of prayer , as a precaution , the @entity62 said wednesday			1
it is already boosting security in some locations , including its embassies , and police vehicles were parked outside the @entity0 offices of @entity11 late tuesday			1
any depiction of @entity20 's prophet is considered blasphemy by many @entity75			1
@entity3 has the largest @entity20 population in @entity77 , with an estimated 4.7 million followers of the faith			1
the @entity11 cartoons are not labeled @entity15 , but several , including one that appears to show a man 's naked rear end , could easily be interpreted as being depictions of @entity20 's prophet			1
@entity3 says it will not authorize protests over anti-islam film @entity11 journalist @entity87 said the magazine did not intend to provoke anger or violence			1
" the aim is to laugh , " @entity87 said			2
" we want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist			2
they can be @entity20 , @entity96 , @entity97			1
everyone can be religious , but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept			0
" @entity87 defended the magazine , saying it was within its rights and not responsible for people 's reactions			0
" in @entity3 , we always have the right to write and draw			2
and if some people are not happy with this , they can sue us and we can defend ourselves			0
you do n't throw bombs ; you discuss , you debate			0
but you do n't act violently			0
we have to stand and resist pressure from extremism			0
" @entity3 prime minister @entity115 expressed his support for the freedom of press , but he said there are limits			2
" we have a free press that can express itself right up to the point of caricature , " @entity115 said tuesday			0
" but there is also a question of responsibility			0
" he assured the public that " all the precautions will be taken " to maintain order			0
the cartoons are provoking outrage among the @entity3 @entity20 community , while other @entity75 have accused the magazine of pandering for attention			1
wednesday 's cartoons were published a day after hundreds of @entity75 took to @entity137 to satirize the @entity26 magazine @entity139 's cover story on " @entity140 " in which the @entity142 - born writer and former @entity20 @entity143 said the recent protests represented mainstream @entity20 opinion worldwide			1
@entity75 shot back with tongue - in - cheek tweets about what really enrages them , such as having a really good hair day but no one notices because they 're wearing hijabs			0
@entity151 , who posted that tweet as @ @entity153 , said @entity11 's latest cartoons were a cynical attempt to inflate sales			1
she disputed the magazine 's position that it just wants to provoke laughter and express its right to free speech			0
" no it is n't			0
it 's for ratings , " she said			0
opinion : media do n't get # @entity167 she compared it to the @entity3 magazine that printed topless photos of @entity172			2
" like printing tawdry pics of ( @entity172 ) @entity174 -- lowbrow rating booster , " she said			0
" if we 're going to chart it on the @entity20 insult - o - meter , it is less inflammatory than the ' film ' but does continue the @entity182 divide we see , " she told @entity1			1
a @entity184 student -- who said that what really enraged her was the release of the @entity188 movie " @entity189 " during @entity190 -- said she had no intention of looking at the @entity11 cartoons			2
tweeting as @ oh_my_golly , she said : " refuse to be a pawn in a game where people deliberately insult beliefs&wish to incite hate / anger / violence citing ' free speech ' " @entity200 , head of the @entity201 in @entity0 , condemned the cartoons " in the strongest possible terms " and expressed surprise that the magazine was running new @entity15 cartoons after its offices were attacked the last time it did so			1
" to repeat the same stupidity , the same idiocy and the same calumnies , the same ignominy seems to us to be nearly psychotic action , " he said			0
the magazine 's offices were the scene of an attack in november when they were burned on the day the magazine was due to publish an issue with a cover appearing to make fun of @entity20 law			2
the cover featured a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of @entity15 saying , " 100 lashes if you 're not dying of laughter			0
" the cartoonist known as @entity230 , who drew the cover , has been under police protection since then			0
wednesday 's issue does not have a @entity15 cartoon on the cover			0
" we learned our lesson , " @entity230 said			0
@entity3 @entity75 feel like scapegoats for nation 's problems @entity3 has seen rising tensions over its rapidly growing @entity20 minority			1
last year , the country banned the wearing of @entity20 veils and other face coverings , claiming they were both degrading and a security risk			1
@entity249 has passed similar legislation , and @entity251 banned the building of minarets , the tall spires that often stand next to mosques			0
@entity1 's @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0

@entity263 in @entity0 condemns cartoons , expresses surprise
@entity3 boosts security at embassies , but there are no reports of violence
a *muslim* who satirized @entity139 on @entity137 dismisses cartoons as cynical sales ploy
editor : the cartoons mock a " lousy " anti-islam film , not the @entity20 prophet
