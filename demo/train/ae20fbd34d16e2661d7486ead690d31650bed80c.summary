-- @entity1 may not work at a powerful @entity3 media outlet , but the might of his 140 character tweets is considered one of this highly wired country 's most influential			1
@entity1 is better known by his 72,000 twitter followers as @entity9 , or ' straight talk ' in @entity3			1
according to twitoast , @entity9 is one of @entity3 's top 10 power twitterers			1
one of his consistent discussions lately has been the @entity3 government 's approach to social media users			1
" @entity3 is competing with @entity16 in trying to control the public , " @entity1 says			1
as we talk , @entity1 tweets a question to his followers , asking what they think about @entity3 president @entity23 's moves against netizens			1
the responses vary , from comparisons to @entity28 's attempts to control speech on the web , to allegations that the administration is trying to hide information from its citizens			1
" people are angry , " @entity1 says			1
the anger stems from a number of incidents , including recent indictments against 19 people			2
the government charged the 19 defendants with sending false text messages under a 50 - year - old telecommunications law that states spreading lies with the intent of harming the public interest is punishable by law			2
the text messages were sent in the wake of @entity16 's november 23rd attack on the south 's @entity51 , which killed two @entity3 marines and two civilians			1
the government says the 19 defendants sent text messages stating that @entity3 had declared war and the military was mobilizing			2
yesterday , @entity3 's @entity58 , which has jurisdiction over constitutional review of statutes , complaints and disputes , ruled that the telecommunications law was unconstitutional			1
the court found the term " public interest " too " unclear and abstract , " according to the court			2
the case before the @entity58 was brought by a blogger who in 2009 , posted a warning online that the country 's foreign reserves would be drained soon because of the government 's irresponsible foreign exchange rate policies during the global economic slowdown			2
the government indicted him with spreading false information online , under the telecommunications law			0
now that the court has ruled the law unconstitutional , legal watchers are predicting the 19 indicted texters will see their indictments reversed			0
the ruling comes as president @entity23 is stepping up his rhetoric and pushing for a united public opinion from his citizens against @entity90			0
in his weekly radio address , @entity23 said , " to this end , we need to stand together united as one			0
there can be no difference between you and me when it comes to national security because our lives and the survival of the nation depend on it			0
" referring to the @entity105 wanting the @entity3 's citizens to question the government , @entity23 said , " they are focusing on trying to pull us apart			1
for this reason , we need to achieve national unity before taking strong military countermeasures			0
if we show the @entity16 how steadfastly united we are , they will not dare challenge us			2
their intentions will be thwarted			0
they always have their eyes open to take advantage of any opportunity if they detect any divisiveness in our minds and thoughts			0
" but @entity1 says the @entity23 administration should harness , not fight social media users			1
" whether public opinion is divided or undivided is not the issue , " @entity1 says			0
" what 's important is whether issues are being fully discussed			0
government is n't always right			0
there should be more communication			0
