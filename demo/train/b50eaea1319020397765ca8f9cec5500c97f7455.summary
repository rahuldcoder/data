-- they 've taken contrasting routes to the @entity4 final , have very different styles of play and polar opposite personalities , but @entity8 and @entity9 will have one thing in common on saturday afternoon on the famous @entity11			1
both will be searching for a maiden grand slam title -- the ultimate validation of their undoubted talents			1
@entity8 , who put out defending champion @entity16 , the biggest upset in a tournament of massive upsets , also dispatched former grand slam champions @entity20 and @entity22 en route to her first final at this level			1
read : @entity16 stunned by @entity26 's @entity8 15th seed @entity9 came through almost unnoticed before thrashing @entity29 's @entity28 , herself a relative unknown , in the semifinal			1
@entity8 has a booming all - court game , which has earned her the tag " @entity32 " -- a reference to its similarity of the style of @entity26 legend @entity37			2
the three - time @entity4 champion is also an admirer : " @entity8 rocks , " @entity37 tweeted as she beat fourth seed @entity41 in another three set nail biter in the semifinals			1
@entity9 's game is definitely not for the purist , with her own unique service action and double handed thumps on both wings			1
it 's not pretty but effective as seven @entity52 career titles testify			0
in the 2007 @entity4 semifinal she played @entity55 , possessor of a classic backhand and no.1 seed at the time			1
she lost the first set lamely and trailed the @entity29 in the second			0
commentators were already lamenting the one - sided nature of the match before @entity9 confounded her critics to pull off a stunning upset			2
she lost to @entity67 in the final , but the experience may prove a big advantage			1
@entity8 will look to ride the wave of support which has greeted her march to the title match			1
the 23 - year - old has earned the affection of the crowds with her outgoing and cheerful personality			0
she has played with a permanent smile on her face even when apparently slipping to defeat against @entity16 and @entity41			2
wrapping up match point against the seemingly invincible @entity16 , she collapsed to the turf in joyful sobs			2
her place in the affections of the fans was sealed			0
" i love @entity4 , " she beamed after beating @entity41 and the feeling is mutual			0
@entity9 is an engaging eccentric , who reportedly brooded for months after taking the brave decision to dispense with the services of her father @entity91 as her coach			0
former @entity94 has taken the job and is credited with damping down the inner turmoil which can undermine @entity9 's best efforts			2
so relaxed was the 28 - year - old that she admitted to taking a half hour cat nap just before dispatching @entity28			0
when asked about it , @entity9 replied " i 'm @entity104 , " as if it offered an explanation for her unusual slumbers			0
it remains to be seen if the prospect of facing the lower ranked 23rd seed @entity8 in the biggest match of their careers will ruffle her newly found sang - froid			0
@entity8 has won three of their four matches , including a three - set quarterfinal match at @entity4 in 2011 as the @entity26 first made her mark on her favorite grass			1
but @entity9 's single win over her came at @entity4 back in 2008			1
it 's certainly a final which absolutely nobody predicted at the start of the fortnight with bookmakers offering odds of 1500 to 1 on its prospect			0
there were clearly few takers with the safe bets on another @entity16 -- @entity128 showdown before the shocks started on the first wednesday			0
lisicki will be looking to become the first @entity26 to win a grand slam since @entity131 won her 22nd and final major at the @entity133			1
@entity131 sent her a good luck text before she beat @entity41			0
perhaps it 's fate , but the last @entity104 success at this level came to @entity9 's new mentor mauresmo back in 2006 when she won two slams			2
both finalists have had to overcome setbacks to reach the ultimate stage			0
@entity8 suffered a career threatening ankle injury in 2009 , while @entity9 's recent slump in form and loss of confidence this year had seen her fail to go past the quarterfinal stage in any tournament before @entity4			1
it 's safe to say that victory come saturday tea time will change the life of one these young women forever as they claim their place in the tennis record books .			0
