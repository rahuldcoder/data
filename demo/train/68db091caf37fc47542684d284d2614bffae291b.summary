-- the line in the middle of @entity4 's forehead was barely noticeable at first			1
it was a faint gray smudge , just a half - inch long from top to bottom			2
" it looked like she ran into a doorjamb , which kids do , " says @entity4 's mother , @entity8			1
but the five - year - old swore she 'd done no such thing			2
when she looked closer , @entity8 also noticed what appeared to be a small bruise or birthmark on the left side of her daughter 's neck			2
that , too , seemed like nothing , but when the marks did n't go away after a couple of weeks , @entity8 took @entity4 to the doctor			1
" it 's just a discoloration , " the pediatrician said , giving @entity8 a cream			2
" keep her out of the sun and put this on it			2
" the cream did n't work			0
five months later , the gray line was still there -- and it now extended halfway down @entity4 's forehead			1
@entity0 : 20 medical mysteries and miracles the @entity38 consulted a second doctor -- this time in southern @entity40 , where the family had recently moved from @entity42 , @entity43 -- and received the same advice			0
@entity8 was n't reassured , but she was n't unduly worried , either			0
@entity4 was otherwise healthy , and she seemed to be enjoying kindergarten at her new school			1
then , in first grade , @entity4 started inexplicably gaining weight and suffered a violent seizure at home one evening , losing consciousness and convulsing			1
the @entity53 doctors who treated her concluded that the seizure had been brought on by the 102 - degree fever she 'd been running , but @entity8 suspected it was n't that simple			0
@entity0 : doctors induce 5 - month coma to save woman 's life a surprising diagnosis \ within a few months of the seizure , the line on @entity4 's forehead stretched down to her eyebrow and looked more like an indentation than a shadow			1
one of @entity4 's teachers told her to wipe the ink off her forehead			1
" i ca n't , " she replied			0
" it 's always there			0
" there were other troubling signs : one side of @entity4 's forehead was normal , but the other was " meaty , " @entity8 recalls			1
and her ears looked out of proportion to one another -- an asymmetry that seemed to extend over her entire face			2
" one side of her face looked like a baby , " @entity8 says			1
" it looked like one side of her face was growing and the other was not			1
" as it turns out , that 's exactly what was happening			0
in 2008 , two and a half years after the line first appeared on @entity4 's face , a geneticist who specializes in facial deformities finally diagnosed her with @entity96 , an extremely rare autoimmune disorder that affects roughly one in a million people			1
@entity4 's own immune system had turned against her so that one side of her face was developing normally while the other side was slowly but surely deteriorating			1
@entity96 , also known as progressive facial hemiatrophy , was first identified in the early 1800s			1
it usually starts in childhood and gets worse with time , and it seems to be more common in girls			0
( although @entity4 was diagnosed by a geneticist , the condition does not appear to be inherited			1
) in addition to the distinctive atrophy that occurs on one side of a patient 's face , it can also cause seizures and other neurological problems			1
the indented line in @entity4 's forehead -- a feature found in about one - quarter of people with facial hemiatrophy -- is known as @entity120 , a @entity122 phrase that translates as " cut of a saber " and evokes a scar that someone who has sustained a gash in a sword fight might be left with			1
after @entity4 was diagnosed , @entity8 went home and looked up @entity130 on the @entity131			1
what she saw was not comforting			0
" there were horrifying pictures , " she says			0
" one side [ of a patient 's face ] was a skeleton and the other side was n't			2
" @entity0 : get really inspired a bleak prognosis there is no cure for @entity96			2
nor are there any proven treatments , although drugs that suppress the immune system have been shown to be beneficial in some cases			0
for two years after @entity4 's diagnosis , the @entity38 consulted expert after expert , and all of them told the family that not only was there no cure , but @entity4 could not have her face reconstructed until the disease stopped progressing , which could take years			1
by that time , the underlying facial bones might also be affected			0
" this was mind - blowing , " @entity8 says			0
" she 's going to go through adolescence with her face destroyed then they 're going to reconstruct it ? " that was n't good enough for @entity8			2
@entity4 was now 11 years old , on the brink of a stage in life that can be tumultuous for even the healthiest and most ordinary kids			2
so @entity8 contacted dr. @entity169 , @entity170 , a plastic surgeon whose name she 'd come across during her online research			0
a professor of surgery at the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity169 specializes in microsurgery and has operated on about 400 patients with facial asymmetry over the past two decades , 140 of them with @entity130			0
he looked at photos of @entity4 and agreed to operate in november 2010			2
the @entity38 made plans to travel to @entity182			0
@entity0 : " indescribable , crazy pain " : i survived dengue fever " like building a teddy bear " the surgery took about seven hours			0
@entity169 and his team transplanted tissue -- complete with functioning blood vessels -- from under @entity4 's left arm and inserted it under her face via an incision in front of her ear			1
" it 's like building a teddy bear , " @entity169 says			0
" the skin and the fur is all there			0
my job is to give the stuffing to bring out its natural form or shape			0
" his goal in these surgeries , he adds , is to " sculpt " the transplanted tissue and integrate it with the healthy tissue on the other side of a patient 's face " smoothly and gradually , so it looks like it was there all along			1
" the relocated tissue will grow along with @entity4 as she matures , @entity169 says -- although he ca n't explain how			1
it could be that the transplanted tissue and blood vessels restore normal blood supply to the damaged side of the face and allow the cells of different tissues to " talk to each other " in ways that prevent further atrophy , he says			1
some @entity130 experts are skeptical that the procedure can actually reverse the course of the disease and prevent damage to the underlying bone and muscle			0
but @entity169 says he has rarely had to perform a second surgery , which , he says , would probably be needed if the disease continued to progress			0
@entity0 : 7 strategies to love the way you look back to school @entity4 will undergo a brief procedure to fine - tune the tissue in her jaw this summer , and she 'll have to visit dr. @entity169 's office every five or six months after that			1
she has a scar that stretches from her underarm to her shoulder , an incision mark on her neck , and , three months after the surgery , her face is still a bit swollen			2
but she 's going to school again and is starting to feel like she 's returning to normal			0
" i like my nose better now , " she says			0

@entity96 is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder
one side of her face was developing normally while the other side was deteriorating
the relocated tissue will grow along with @entity4 as she matures
