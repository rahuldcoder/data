editor 's note : this article contains possible spoilers for the @entity5 opening ceremony			1
( @entity6 ) -- the opening ceremony for the @entity8 has been shrouded in mystery , with director @entity10 keen to keep any details of the $ 42 million spectacle under wraps			1
however despite acknowledging that the @entity14 and social media make it too tempting for people to keep a secret and that spoilers are now part of " the modern world , " @entity10 graciously invited 60,000 fans to witness a rehearsal of the ceremony at the @entity24 in @entity25 , days before the actual event , asking them to not tweet photos and suggesting the hashtag # savethesurprise			1
despite many of the clearly wowed audience sticking to the director 's wishes , details have since emerged , so what exactly do we know ? or what do we think we know ? way back in april it was rumored that @entity38 had filmed a segment as @entity40 at @entity41 with @entity10			1

" one part of the stadium is even set up to look like the @entity87 -- a ship that brought migrants from the @entity90 to the @entity60 in the 1940s			2
perhaps the most intriguing prediction comes from @entity60 newspaper @entity93			0
bordering on the so - crazy - it - just - might - work , the paper reports that a 40 - foot @entity96 is set to do battle with an army of @entity99 '			0
yes , you read that correctly			0
after a dance routine where approximately 100 kids dance on hospital beds , and representations of famous children 's book characters join them , @entity96 pops out of a giant bed , surrounded by flying @entity109 terrorizing the youngsters			0
this is where the 30 or so @entity99 ' will float into the stadium to do battle with @entity96			0
