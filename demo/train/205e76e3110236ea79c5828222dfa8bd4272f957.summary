-- the roar of the jubilant crowd assembled in @entity4 's @entity3 said it all			2
nearly four months ago , longtime @entity7 strongman @entity6 finally yielded to political reality and stepped down from power			1
@entity6 's fall -- coming on the heels of the ouster of neighboring @entity15 's @entity14 @entity13 -- was seen by many as part of a domino effect			2
the @entity21 world , it seemed , was finally on the brink of a peaceful democratic transition that had eluded the troubled region for generations			1
today , however , the promise of a peaceful @entity27 appears to be yielding to the reality of a long , violent summer as dictators across the @entity31 and @entity32 draw a line in the sand and fight to maintain control of their countries			1
protesters , meanwhile , are showing no sign of backing down			1
" we 've seen the last ( @entity31 ) dictator leave voluntarily , " @entity39 , a regional expert at the @entity40 , a conservative @entity41 think tank , recently told @entity0			1
see the latest daily developments at @entity0 's @entity45 @entity47 president @entity46 and other @entity49 leaders will continue to push for peaceful change when possible , @entity39 said			1
but dictators in the region have been spooked by the fate of @entity6 , who is now facing trial and a possible death sentence , and @entity57 's @entity56 , who is facing an onslaught from armed rebels and @entity61 air forces			1
they " see there is no possibility of a peaceful retirement , " @entity39 said			2
and many of them also " believe that their country is their personal fight			1
" while it is possible to identify trends that pertain to the entire region , a number of analysts stress that each country has unique circumstances and challenges that throw the notion of an all - encompassing @entity27 into question			1
@entity57 : no signs of waning in @entity57 , opposition to @entity56 has been hampered by the fact that the country 's sense of national identity is " very weak , " according to @entity87 , a senior fellow at the @entity88			1
tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated @entity32 country comes first , a fact that has made it extremely tough for @entity56 's opponents to present a unified front			1
@entity56 's violent reaction to protesters -- and threats of a massacre in the rebel - held city of @entity101 -- led to the passage of a @entity104 resolution authorizing military steps to protect civilians			1
@entity61 leaders , who believe the safety of @entity57 civilians ca n't be secured without @entity56 's ouster , have since embarked on a two - month bombing campaign targeting government forces			2
@entity61 secretary general @entity113 announced wednesday that the alliance has decided to extend its mission in the country by 90 days			1
@entity56 still refuses to step aside , but has been discussing a possible @entity118 - brokered cease - fire with @entity120 president @entity119			2
@entity57 's war has the potential to become a " protracted and costly stalemate , " @entity121 , another senior fellow at the @entity88 , recently told reporters			2
there 's a " real danger of chaos " and protracted tribal warfare if @entity56 falls , @entity121 said			2
@entity130 may be able to exploit such a situation , he warned			0
5 options for the @entity47 in @entity57 close to 900,000 people have fled @entity57 since that country 's conflict began in february , according to the @entity136			1
@entity7 : tension escalates meanwhile , in nearby @entity7 reformers are upset with the pace of change since @entity6 's fall			1
" we 've waited ... and nothing has happened , " @entity142 , 43 , said friday at a demonstration in @entity3			0
" @entity6 and his men have not ( yet ) been punished for their crimes			0
" some protesters on friday urged the creation of a civil presidential council to replace the military regime now running the country until democratic elections are held in september			1
others called for the expeditious return of stolen assets , as well as a generally more open society			0
@entity159 : military threatens @entity7 's revolution tension continues to exist between some of the more secular , liberal - minded activists and the more conservative @entity165 , @entity6 's primary opposition for years			0
" we need rules and regulations to guide us and to protect individual freedoms and the rights of minorities " before the elections , said law student @entity166			0
but @entity174 , a member of the @entity165 , said the september election will be good for the country , even if it benefits more established groups like his or remnants of the once - ruling @entity179 at the expense of newer political parties			1
" why wo n't @entity7 just accept the results of the recent referendum ? " he asked			2
" the date ... has already been set			0
" @entity186 powder keg to the northeast , @entity186 's government stands accused of committing atrocities against its own people			0
the international watchdog group @entity191 released a report wednesday alleging that president @entity194 's regime has carried out a " systematic " series of abuses against protesters that could " qualify as crimes against humanity			2
" the group 's 57 - page document contains details from dozens of victims and witnesses to abuses in @entity208 province , the southwestern @entity186 powder keg where the unrest engulfing the country began in mid-march before spreading across the country			2
at present , the report said , there have been around 887 deaths across @entity186 , including at least 418 people in @entity208			0
the crackdown in @entity208 last month became so intense that eyewitnesses spoke of bodies bloating in the streets and injured people being treated at makeshift secret clinics to avoid detection by government security forces			0
@entity191 is urging the @entity136 to hold @entity194 's regime accountable			0
@entity49 leaders have imposed new sanctions against @entity194 and several of his most prominent supporters			1
for its part , the @entity186 protest movement shows no sign of waning			0
a two and a half minute @entity234 video clip showing multiple wounds on the body of a 13 - year - old boy from @entity208 -- @entity238 -- has prompted international outrage			0
a @entity241 page calling itself " we are all the martyr , the child @entity238 " had 60,000 followers by tuesday			0
@entity245 : ' @entity247 's @entity246 ' the push for democratic reform is also encountering fierce resistance on the strategically critical @entity251			0
the leaders of two key @entity47 allies , @entity245 and @entity254 , are struggling to maintain control despite slowly mounting international pressure			1
on wednesday , @entity245 lifted state of emergency laws in place since march that had allowed the silencing of opposition leaders and journalists			0
@entity263 has appealed for dialogue , saying that talks with opposition groups will begin in july			0
the minority @entity268 government , however , continued its crackdown on the country 's major @entity272 political opposition movement			2
among other things , security forces fired tear gas to disperse pro-reform demonstrators in several @entity272 residential areas , according to one human rights activist			0
a source for the opposition told @entity0 that " sporadic sounds of bombs and bird - shot clusters were also heard			0
" the government also filed charges wednesday against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country 's @entity290 party , according to two opposition sources			2
regional monarchies eye @entity245 unrest @entity245 is set to hold parliamentary elections in september , filling seats vacated by members of @entity290 , which left parliament in protest over the crackdown			0
the question of how hard @entity49 powers -- the @entity47 in particular -- should push for change in @entity245 is complicated by the fact that the tiny @entity306 country is home to the @entity309 's @entity308			1
neighboring @entity310 and the @entity47 are both worried that a successful @entity272 uprising would transform @entity245 into an @entity247 client state			1
" @entity245 is @entity247 's @entity246 , " @entity39 said , referencing former @entity315 strongman @entity314 's insistence that @entity246 was rightfully an @entity315 province			0
if @entity245 's government falls , " there is no question -- no ifs , ands or buts -- @entity245 would become an @entity247 satellite , and the @entity308 would be sent packing , " he predicted			0
@entity245 is " pretty much the one country where ( @entity41 ) ca n't afford regime change , " he said			1
@entity254 : possible @entity130 stronghold ? finally , nearby @entity254 continues to be rocked by escalating clashes between rebels and forces loyal to embattled president @entity329			0
@entity0 's @entity330 on the worsening crisis in @entity254 four missiles struck a compound wednesday where generals who defected from the @entity254 regime were meeting , according to a spokesman for the generals			0
fierce clashes also erupted between government security forces and @entity346 tribesmen wednesday in front of the @entity348 in @entity349 , eyewitnesses and residents said			0
the @entity351 tribe has opposed government forces in intermittent fighting for more than a month			2
fifteen tribesmen have died and 31 have been injured from clashes in the past two days , said @entity356 , spokesman for the head of @entity351 tribe			0
witnesses also reported seeing at least three houses on fire near where the clashes were taking place wednesday			0
@entity329 , who has ruled his poor , arid country since 1978 , " does not want peace , " said the spokesman for the head of the @entity351 tribe			2
" @entity329 thrives with blood being spilt			0
they attacked us and we had to defend			0
" government spokesman @entity371 said mediation efforts meant to stem the rash of recent violence between the country 's tribal groups and @entity329 's government ended saturday without a peace accord because @entity346 tribesmen would not negotiate			1
at least 100 people have also been arrested in the city of @entity382 , while hundreds more have been injured across the country in recent fighting , according to a @entity136 statement released tuesday			1
the @entity47 @entity386 in @entity387 has condemned what it called the " unprovoked and unjustified attack " on demonstrators in @entity382			1
it praised the protesters and called on @entity329 " to move immediately " on the president 's previous promise to transfer power			1
@entity329 , however , has been a leading @entity47 ally against @entity130 , which has a @entity254 - based branch that has claimed responsibility for two attempted attacks on the @entity47			1
@entity47 's main concern regarding @entity254 is that the country could become an @entity130 stronghold if @entity329 falls , @entity39 said			1
but @entity47 policymakers also " have to recognize that @entity130 rose under @entity329 , " he said			1
" keeping him in does n't keep @entity130 out			0

violence has escalated across the @entity31 and @entity32 in recent months
dictators across the region are fighting to cling to power , while protesters refuse to back down
each country faces unique circumstances and challenges
the @entity47 and other @entity49 powers have not pushed as hard for change in certain countries
