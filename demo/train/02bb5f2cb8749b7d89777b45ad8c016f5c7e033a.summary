-- on the @entity2 , a truly private conversation is hard to come by			0
personal communications on apps , e-mail and social networks are very much an open book , and they leave a trail of personal data that can potentially be accessed by criminals , corporations and government agencies			0
no wonder more and more people are using apps whose messages quickly disappear from phones once they 've been read			2
take @entity17 , a self - destructing messaging app that takes security very seriously			1
the free app has been available on @entity22 for a little more than a year and on monday , it expanded its reach to a wider audience with an @entity26 version			2
like the better - known @entity28 ( and the lesser - known @entity29 ) , messages on @entity17 live briefly before supposedly vanishing forever from your phone and the prying eyes of computer servers			1
there are many security advantages to this type of communication			2
the format makes it difficult for recipients to share , forward and spread messages			2
any sensitive photos or texts have a better chance of not becoming a permanent artifact on the @entity2			0
they are also deleted from the companies ' servers ( or in the case of @entity17 , never stored on a company server ) , making it difficult for hackers , criminals or government agencies to retrieve old conversations			1
@entity28 has become hugely popular in the past year			1
its users now send more than 350 million photos a day			0
the company has played down the security advantages of self - destructing messages , focusing instead on the playful aspects of the " ephemeral " messaging trend , like having fun and living in the moment			1
fairly or not , the service has also developed a reputation as a platform for sexting			0
" @entity28 is not a great way to send photos you want to keep safe and secure , " said @entity28 co-founder @entity70 at the @entity72 conference last week			1
he cited the ability of recipients to take screenshots and of hackers to access content as reasons the platform was n't safe for " inappropriate photos			0
" @entity17 was developed by computer - security experts and has some heavy - duty layers of security to keep communications anonymous and private			1
each message -- whether text , photo , video or voice -- is encrypted with a one - time - use unique key , and only the sender and @entity17 users have those keys			1
any telling metadata is stripped out when you send attachments , and deleted messages are forensically erased , or " shredded , " from your device			2
" no security is 100 % , but we are the best available , " said @entity102 , ceo and co-founder of @entity17			1
@entity17 also has a few more messaging features than the minimalist @entity28			1
you can choose to let messages live for days , not just seconds			0
the @entity22 app can send encrypted attachments , though you can not yet send @entity113 attachments on the @entity26 version			1
@entity17 's founders frequently test the app with their own network of well - known hackers , and as well as with a tougher crowd : kids			1
" we really made it to try and protect them from the permanence of the @entity2 , " said @entity102 , whose own children use the app. there are always security risks			0
if your phone is compromised , a hacker could track keystrokes while you are typing out messages			0
people are another potential weak link -- someone could steal your phone while you are logged in			0
or the person on the receiving end of your messages could violate your trust and share the information			0
" you have to remember , there 's no magic pill for betrayers , " said @entity102			0
unlike @entity28 , @entity17 does n't give a notification when someone captures a screenshot			1
it 's difficult to take one , and the company thought a notification would give users a false sense of security			0
@entity17 does n't just want to take on @entity28 , it also hopes to be an alternative to @entity156 , @entity157 and free international texting tools like @entity159			1
typical online - communication tools store information on servers indefinitely			0
that can include the content of messages , participants in the conversation , time stamps and even location information			0
many of the companies that host the messages , like @entity172 and @entity173 , make their money on personal data which they use to sell targeted ads. they are n't invested in keeping your personal data private because it 's not smart business			0
@entity17 has a different type of business plan that is n't based on personal data			2
the app is free , but eventually the company will charge its power users for in - app purchases , such as paying for a message to live forever			2
in a year filled with increased awareness of cybersecurity and the government 's ability to snoop on digital communications , @entity17 's anonymous , highly secure communication may be a killer feature all on its own .			1
