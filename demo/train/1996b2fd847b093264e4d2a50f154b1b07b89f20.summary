the crew had been covering an anti-government protest when they were robbed			0
@entity0 assured @entity67 the incident was being investigated			2
" we expect that you will be able to go with the loss recovered , " @entity0 said			2

in a televised speech on thursday , @entity0 said @entity3 was not showing " the people working , studying , building the homeland			1
" " enough war propaganda			1
i do not accept war propaganda against @entity33			1
if they do not rectify things , get out of @entity33 , @entity3 , get out , " @entity0 said , to applause from his pro-government audience			1
" fuera ! @entity102 ! " people in the crowd shouted -- " out ! out ! " hours later , government officials notified seven journalists for @entity107 and @entity28 that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked			0
@entity3 teams from outside @entity33 were told to book flights back to their home countries			2
@entity0 described @entity3 's journalists with some of the same adjectives he uses for his political opponents			1
" a group of fascists with their aggressions want to take us away from peace , " @entity0 said			2
" they are not going to do that			0
and we are going to show them			0
" when members of the @entity125 were told their credentials were denied , they were asked several times when they would be leaving the country			0
while the journalists were asked to leave , @entity107 and @entity3 en @entity69 continue to broadcast in @entity33			2
@entity3 has repeatedly asked for a meeting with officials			2
" @entity3 has reported both sides of the tense situation in @entity33 , even with very limited access to government officials , " @entity3 said in a statement , adding that at the time its credentials were revoked , @entity3 was seeking an interview with the president			1
" we hope the government will reconsider its decision			0
meanwhile , we will continue reporting on @entity33 in the fair , accurate and balanced manner we are known for			0
" a top legislative leader for the ruling party said the government will investigate the allegations against @entity3 , and will not " tremble in acting against those who make an attempt against the motherland			2
" the move to revoke @entity3 's press credentials comes after weeks of protests that mark the largest demonstrations @entity0 has faced in his 11 months in power following the death of president @entity157			1
government authorities and opposition leaders have blamed each other for deaths resulting from the violence			0
@entity163 , an opposition leader in @entity33 , faces arson and conspiracy charges in connection with the unrest			0
@entity163 , who has denied the charges , is being held in a military prison outside @entity170			0
