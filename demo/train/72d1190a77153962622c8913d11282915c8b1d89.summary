-- whether it 's topping the podium at the @entity5 and @entity7 events or finding a welcome diversion away from the pressure cooker atmosphere of international competition , the @entity3 women 's ski team is certainly hitting the high notes			1
with the likes of teenage sensation @entity15 , super reliable @entity16 and a fit - again @entity17 in its ranks , plus a strong supporting cast , the prospects for the season ahead look more than promising			1
their ultimate focus is the world championships on the home snow of @entity24 next february and the training has been intense -- but away from the piste the @entity3 team room is more than often than not reverberating to the sound of music			1
gathered around the most accomplished musician , the guitar - strumming downhill and super-g specialist @entity32 , a host of popular standards are belted out with gusto and and more often than not in tune			0
@entity32 , who can also play the violin and piano , made the podium in downhill at the @entity7 event in @entity42 last year and took 11th in the @entity43 in the discipline			0
an outside bet for a medal at the 2015 world championships , @entity32 believes that her other passion boosts her sporting performance			1
" i feel something with music that i feel on my skis and it puts me in the zone , " she told @entity0 's @entity52			0
@entity16 , a four - time @entity5 medalist , the most by a @entity3 woman skier , is happy to be in the chorus in the musical sense but believes that as a team bonding exercise all feel the benefit of a different rhythm			1
" it 's been the same group of girls for a lot of time and it 's a lot of fun , " she said			0
@entity16 's bronze in @entity71 in the @entity72 was added to @entity15 's gold in the slalom and both were firmly in the media spotlight in the aftermath of the @entity78 , with a string of invites to celebrity events			1
the 30 - year - old @entity16 , who has been on the @entity7 circuit since she was just 15 , is delighted to see the achievements of the team raise the profile of alpine skiing in the @entity3 and take it into the mainstream			1
" to see our sport at the pinnacle of sport in @entity3 is really cool because it 's been such a @entity93 dominated sport , " she added			2
@entity16 will be looking to add to her five world championship medals by adding an elusive gold when the action gets underway in @entity97 in february 2015			1
with the precocious @entity15 starting the 2014 - 15 season with a fine @entity7 win in giant slalom in @entity105 and @entity17 on the comeback trail after knee surgery , the trio will , in the words of the @entity100 song , be aiming for a " @entity108 " at @entity97			2
had he still been around -- the musician died in 1997 -- @entity100 , a skiing fanatic who made his home in nearby @entity113 , would doubtless been among the cheerleaders for the @entity3 team			2
@entity100 may also have had a soft spot for @entity117 , another skiing star with musical talent , who has enjoyed chart success in her native @entity121 with her song " my way is my decision			0
" the two - time olympic gold medalist even referenced @entity100 on @entity126 when appearing at a @entity7 event in @entity24 in 2012 , saying many of his songs were translated into @entity121 and remained popular standards in her country			0
of course there will be one piece of music that all the contenders for global glory will be hoping to hear in @entity24 , their national anthems to signify the top place on the podium			0
but as @entity3 team member @entity141 told @entity0 all the intense rivalry can be put aside by making music together			0
" it 's nice to just sit down for 20 minutes to remember we are friends , not just competitors , " she said			0
with such a strong team ethic in the @entity3 ranks it may be a safe bet to assume the sound of the @entity149 will be ringing around @entity97 to delight home followers .			2

@entity3 women 's ski team has strong prospects for season ahead
