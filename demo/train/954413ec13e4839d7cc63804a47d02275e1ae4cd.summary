-- i 've long been haunted by a chilling statistic from an old study : 54 % of women 18 to 25 said they would rather be hit by a truck than be fat			1
when i read it , i was aghast			0
who , i wondered , were the women who would choose blood and broken bones over some extra body weight ? turns out they are my friends -- and maybe yours			1
and , perhaps , a few men ( more on that later )			0
" how fast is the truck going ? " my friend @entity16 asked			0
" how fat would i have to be ? " " does it run over my lower half or upper half ? " @entity21 mused			0
" oh , also , " she said , chewing on a @entity23 noodle as we chatted over dinner , " you might have to get your jaw wired shut and then you 'd definitely lose weight			0
" but women do n't need to wade into traffic to suffer for beauty ; these horrific would - you - rather games are closer to reality than we might think			1
many of us endure pain in the service of beauty every single day			1
we rip off our hair with hot wax , jam our soft skin into modern - day corsets , and burn our scalps with dyes			1
we ask doctors to suck out the fat in our thighs , pump @entity47 into our faces and inflate our breasts with silicon			0
we smush our feet into unholy angles in skyscraper heels , and as medical professionals have said yet again , those fabulous louboutins cause everything from muscle strains and ligament tears to stress fractures			2
are n't we beyond this ? have n't we come a long way , baby ? you would think that the @entity64 might also herald the end of the @entity66			1
according to the @entity68 , nearly 15 million cosmetic surgery procedures were done last year , a 5 % bump for the industry			0
@entity47 and facelifts saw the biggest increases			0
the founder of @entity74 recently became the world 's youngest female self - made billionaire , to the tune of $ 250 million in annual sales			1
at a moment when girls and women have never been more empowered , they are in thrall to ever more ruthless standards of beauty			1
this is likely not a coincidence			0
in her 1991 bombshell book , " @entity89 , " a young @entity90 named @entity88 observed that as the women 's movement powers up , the beauty industry clamps down on our self - esteem			1
unprecedented billions of marketing dollars have been unleashed to promote beauty as essential to female confidence			2
yet beauty is defined in such a way as to be inaccessible to all but an elite few			2
still , we buy into it			0
as our paychecks increase , so does our beauty spending -- and suffering			2
is the price of freedom an actual pound of flesh ? not just freedom , as it turns out , but success			0
beauty pays off -- literally			2
@entity112 professor @entity111 has found that attractive waitresses make better tips			2
@entity115 , an economist at the @entity116 , studies pulchronomics , or the economics of beauty			2
in his book , " @entity120 : why attractive people are more successful , " he reports that attractive women are more likely to land a wealthy spouse , and that attractive @entity125 workers will earn $ 230,000 more in their lifetimes than their less fetching colleagues			1
unattractive women are less likely to work at all than their attractive peers , a phenomenon that does not show up in men			1
@entity115 goes so far as to propose legal protection for " ugly " people through an extension of the @entity136			2
by this logic , is the nearly $ 4,000 a woman will spend on mascara in her lifetime a kind of perverse retirement investment ? apparently we women have to spend money to make money , though perhaps not in the way we anticipated			2
lest the guys think this is yet another unfortunate burden for women to shoulder , think again			0
men are showing up in the crosshairs of beauty marketers and under the knives of surgeons			0
last year , fewer women had breast enlargements , but " moobs " -- that 's man boobs -- clearly caused an unprecedented amount of anxiety			1
more than 21,000 breast reductions were performed on men , an increase of 5 %			0
and in @entity115 's work , men 's salaries were docked more for unattractiveness than women 's			1
my friend @entity16 ca n't stop thinking about getting hit by the truck			0
" the thing is , " she told me , " if i got run over it would n't be my fault , but being fat is something other people can blame me for			0
" that 's precisely what beauty marketers want us to think : if we cripple our feet in heels , buy the @entity74 , and go under the knife , hey , at least we tried			1
i ca n't help but wonder who we are trying for , and if the extra cash is worth it			0
the beauty industry is driving that truck , and it 's going to hit us no matter what			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 : even though high - heeled shoes are bad for our feet , women still wear them
@entity195 : you would think that the @entity64 might also herald the end of the @entity66
she says there 's a reason why women suffer for beauty and pay to be more beautiful
@entity195 : it 's because attractive people are more likely to be successful and earn more
