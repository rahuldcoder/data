@entity0 went home to @entity2 nearly six years ago , but the nation is still working through the contentious national security legacy he left behind			1
a hotly disputed @entity6 report on the @entity8 's brutal interrogation tactics is tearing open barely healed political wounds first opened after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			2
the report found @entity8 tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the @entity14 and @entity15 in the dark about them			0
the questions raised by the @entity20 's document -- about how to wage a relentless war on terrorism within constitutional and moral constraints -- seem as intense as ever			2
and the debate is not nearing resolution			0
president @entity26 came to power vowing to turn the page from @entity0 - era terror policies , which he said flouted core @entity31 values			1
but three - quarters of the way through his own two - term presidency , he is still wrestling with the long shadow cast by the war on terror and the methods @entity0 chose to fight it			1
and in some cases , @entity26 is facing his own criticism for his approach to terrorism , including his decision to vastly expand a drone program bequeathed him by @entity0			1
the reaction of a deeply polarized @entity15 to the long delayed @entity20 report , not to mention fierce @entity8 push back , shows how hard it will be to build any national consensus on the proper approach to a threat like terrorism			0
" one of the strengths that makes @entity31 exceptional is our willingness to openly confront our past , face our imperfections , make changes and do better , " @entity26 said in a statement			1
" rather than another reason to refight old arguments , i hope that today 's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past			2
" @entity26 banned " enhanced interrogation techniques " like water boarding and sleep deprivation , that were the subject of the report released tuesday , soon after taking office in 2009			1
' old arguments ' but resolving those " old arguments " is proving more difficult			0
the @entity31 , for instance , has transferred prisoners to foreign governments that still employ harsh techniques			2
and @entity26 faces questions about his own conduct in the campaign against terrorism , notably the drone expansion			2
that program , which utilizes drones armed with missiles to pursue terror suspects outside any sort of judicial process in foreign countries , has raised moral questions rivaling those about the torture program			0
sen. @entity89 made the most passionate case against @entity8 tactics many see as torture on tuesday			1
his remarks were particularly notable because @entity26 defeated @entity89 in 2008 in an election that served as a rejection of @entity0 's national security leadership			1
" what were the policies ? what was their purpose ? did they achieve it ? " @entity89 , who suffered torture himself as a prisoner during the @entity106 , asked			2
" did they make us safer ? less safe ? or did they make no difference ? what did they gain us ? what did they cost us ? " he added : " the @entity31 people need the answers to these questions			1
" but as tuesday 's release of the majority report by @entity122 on the committee showed , those questions remain deeply divisive			0
" it 's a pure political piece of crap , " said the normally courtly @entity126 @entity125 sen. @entity124			0
@entity130 @entity129 sen. @entity129 accused the committee led by outgoing @entity122 chairwoman @entity132 of trying to embarrass the @entity0 administration by publishing the report			2
@entity135 sen. @entity135 of @entity136 said he had always believed that the @entity8 tactics were counterproductive			0
but he said the @entity26 administration , which has sought to try terror suspects in civilian courts , had gone far too far in repudiating @entity0 - era methods			1
" the policies the @entity144 has employed , treat terrorists as common criminals , not enemy combatants , " @entity135 said in a statement			0
" i 'm convinced their criminalization of the war is causing our nation to lose valued intelligence which can help protect our nation			0
" acknowledgment of crimes some critics of the @entity0 administration anti-terrorism strategy say the arguments will never be resolved without some public acknowledgment that crimes were committed			1
the @entity161 has twice investigated the issue of enhanced interrogations and decided against bringing charges against @entity8 operatives who were under intense pressure to avoid additional attacks after september 11			0
@entity26 has also made a political decision that despite his belief enhanced interrogation compromised bedrock @entity31 values , he will not seek to dredge up the past by backing prosecution for @entity8 officers opposed by crimes			1
but @entity176 , legal director of the @entity177 , which represents some detainees at @entity179 , said the @entity8 had used false claims to cover up " monstrous crimes			0
" " we renew our demand for accountability for those individuals responsible for the @entity8 torture program , " @entity176 said in a statement			0
@entity188 , executive director of the @entity189 , called for a special prosecutor to hold the " architects and perpetrators of the torture program " accountable			0
" this should be the beginning of a process , not the end			0
the report should shock president @entity26 and @entity15 into action , to make sure that torture and cruelty are never used again			2
" but independent sen. @entity202 , who sits on the @entity20 , told @entity203 that prosecutions are " not really the point			0
" " i am less concerned about prosecutions than i am about — let ' s not let this happen again			0
" senior officials have privately said that @entity26 sees putting the war on terror onto a more sustainable footing as one of the key tasks of his presidency			1
" we must define the nature and scope of this struggle , or else it will define us , " @entity26 said in a signature speech at the @entity216 last year			2
@entity26 's unresolved questions but the president looks certain to hand many unresolved questions on how to combat terrorism to his successor , as @entity0 passed them to him			1
@entity26 has yet to honor a promise to close @entity179 , due to @entity125 opposition and logistical issues about what to do with prisoners like confessed september 11 mastermind @entity231			0
spurred by revelations from fugitive intelligence analyst @entity233 , @entity26 has also put new constraints on the @entity236 's phone record and data trawling programs but declined to end them			1
and after pulling troops out of @entity241 and ending combat in @entity243 , the president will spend his last two years in office wrestling with a new front in the war on terror — @entity247 in @entity248 and @entity241			1
there was no word on tuesday from the man back at the center of the debate : @entity0			0
but the former president told @entity203 's @entity255 last week that the @entity31 was " fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity8 serving on our behalf			1
" former vice president @entity260 — the architect of many @entity0 war on terror policies -- told the @entity263 that claims that the @entity8 acted unlawfully were " a bunch of hooey			1
