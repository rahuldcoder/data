@entity0 -- it 's a classic family scene			0
the proud parents showing off their new baby in the garden			2
a doting grandpa snapping photographs			0
fine for @entity8 or @entity9			0
but when the baby in question is the future @entity13 king , and the photos are the first official photos , it does n't take long for the world to weigh in -- on their quality , no less			1
most seem to agree that @entity18 , father of @entity19 , and granddad to @entity21 of @entity22 , should leave royal photography to the professionals			2
" they are lovely snaps for a grandfather to have taken			2
but in terms of the quality , they are not really what you want for such a historic picture " is the verdict of @entity31 , vice chairman of the @entity32 and a photographer for the @entity34			1
the @entity38 describes @entity19 and prince @entity40 's decision to use " one of proud grandpa @entity43 's happy family snaps " as " a startling break with tradition			1
" most criticism zeroed in on the focus and the lighting -- always a challenge for amateur photographers not equipped with fancy flashes or reflectors			1
prince @entity40 and @entity19 , the latter holding @entity21 swaddled in a white blanket , are posed on the lawn of her parents ' home in @entity59 with the sun behind them , a difficult shot to pull off			2
" i guess the reason @entity19 's father chose backlight was to avoid bright sun on little @entity21 , " speculates the @entity63 's royal photographer , @entity62			1
he 's happy to share some advice though			2
" back - lighting is always a little tricky for the non-professionals but it does give a nice result			2
photographing against the sun needs a fill - in flash			0
another option would be to use an area in shade away from harsh light			0
" his other tip ? " my professional view would be to see more of baby @entity21			2
" ' babies , happy parents and dogs all bring smiles ' the inclusion of the family pets -- the @entity88 ' cocker spaniel @entity87 and the @entity90 ' golden retriever @entity91 -- in some of the snaps also gets a mixed reception			1
a reporter for @entity95 remarked that the official photographs came " in a choice of formats : with or without dogs			2
" @entity31 , of the @entity34 , was more scathing			0
" the photograph with the dogs is the worst			2
one of the dogs in the corner looks like a furry rug , " he wrote			0
but the pictures got a more favorable write - up from some @entity1 readers who commented on the story			1
" babies , happy parents and dogs all bring smiles and the world needs more smiles ! " said @entity108			1
" its nice to see a family snap and not a professional one			0
its a special time with a new baby i hope the press backs off and let them enjoy it , " wrote @entity116 the public also weighed in on @entity123			0
" who cares ? the photos are beautiful and show a new family ! i think it 's great that ' @entity131 ' got to take the photos , " tweeted @entity127 , a mother of two from the @entity129			0
" i 'm no royal watcher , but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby @entity21 grampa			0
can u blame them ? " posted @ @entity138 , a portrait studio in @entity139 , @entity140			0
no ' feeling of grandeur ' however , @entity144 , an editorial and celebrity photographer in @entity147 , told @entity1 that taking such informal pictures jars the royal " brand			1
" " the amateur image that these photos put across certainly does n't create the most grand or royal image in the viewer 's mind , " he said			1
" they 're decent photos			0
but at the same time , they certainly do n't have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos			1
" he acknowledged that the family may have been trying to project a casual , informal image			0
but , he added , " you can still make it casual			1
but this is just casual and poor quality			1
they did n't have to make a bad quality product to put that idea across			1
" @entity173 , a professional photographer in @entity174 , agrees			1
" it 's obvious that a professional did n't take these			1
it has n't been color - corrected			0
even somebody with a modicum of @entity182 knowledge could improve these pictures immeasurably , " he said			0
" it 's not a very good effort			0
it 's a particularly poor effort given that he 's taking pictures of such an important thing at such an important time			1
" but @entity191 , a friend of the late @entity192 , told @entity1 's " @entity195 " show that she thinks @entity40 's mother would have been delighted by his approach			1
" one of the things she told me is that she so much wanted @entity40 to have a normal life with his family in the future , with whoever he wed and had children with , " she said			0
" all of her dreams have come true and her legacy 's coming true , and all the influences she 's had on @entity40 , the normalcy , is showing through so greatly now			0
she would be immensely happy			0
" interactive : where does @entity21 of @entity22 fit in to the royal family tree ? @entity1 's @entity211 wrote and reported in @entity0 , and @entity212 reported in @entity213 .			1

" babies , happy parents and dogs all bring smiles , " @entity1 reader says of the pictures
professional photographers question the lighting , focus and composition of the snaps
" they 're not terrible , " but they do n't have royal grandeur , says one photographer
" you can still make it casual , but this is just casual and poor quality , " says another
