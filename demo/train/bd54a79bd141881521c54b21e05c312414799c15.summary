-- @entity9 's " @entity8 " is one of these films that comes along every so often that captures the imaginations of the critics and has most of us dancing around singing " @entity7			1
" every time this happens , however , there are one or two critics of otherwise sound mind who have a less than enthusiastic reaction			0
this time it 's my turn			0
not to say that " @entity8 " is n't an entertaining , well made and thought provoking film			1
it also boasts some exceptional acting work from its lead , @entity22 , as well as a chilling turn from @entity24 , as the menacing gangster who insinuates himself into her life			1
it 's just that i was n't blown away and while we critics do n't exactly have a hive mind , when you come across a film that is worshiped by many colleagues who you respect that you simply " like , " you wonder if only for a moment , whether there 's something wrong with you			0
@entity37 ( @entity22 ) is a stunningly beautiful young woman in her early 20s living in @entity38 , @entity39 , who dreams of winning the @entity42 title			1
the day before she is to audition for the pageant , @entity37 and her friend @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , also an aspiring beauty queen , end up in a seedy nightclub populated by dangerous men and the women who love them ( which includes @entity44 )			2
a victim of " wrong place at wrong time " syndrome , @entity37 ends up being the only living witness to a massacre perpetrated by @entity56 ( @entity24 ) the local drug kingpin and his gang , as they storm the nightclub			2
while searching for @entity60 the next morning , @entity37 makes the mistake of trusting a local traffic officer with her story and things go markedly downhill from there			1
@entity56 takes an immediate shine to @entity37 ( who would n't ? ) and rather brazenly begins to use her in his criminal endeavors , including running cash across the border for weapons , all in exchange not only for the safety of her father and brother , but also so @entity56 will fix the beauty pageant			2
it 's like watching the fastest case of @entity80 on record			0
@entity37 comes across as a weak and superficial woman and while this is n't a problem in and of itself , it can be frustrating to watch such a character repeatedly make what , to me , were obvious mistakes			1
then again , i have never been in her situation			0
i guess you could say i had a failure in my ability to suspend disbelief			0
the film is expertly shot , however , and director @entity9 does a great job creating dread , building suspense and pacing the film as things get darker and darker for @entity37			1
alas , along the way she makes mistake after mistake			0
" @entity8 " is based on the true story of former @entity106 , @entity107 , who was arrested in 2008 for being part of an international drug trafficking ring			1
all in all , there is enough suspense , quality acting and truly harrowing scenes in " @entity8 " but i felt like i should like it more than i did			2
" @entity8 " is rated r ( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian )			0
it 's extremely violent with contact gunbattles and contains an upsetting but non-graphic scene of rape .			0
