three games without scoring constituted a slump for @entity4			1
but the drought is now over for the three - time world player of the year			0
@entity4 netted the opener and assisted on @entity9 's thunderbolt as @entity10 moved closer to a place in the quarterfinals of the @entity13 by defeating @entity14 2 - 0 in @entity15 on wednesday			1
the result could n't match @entity10 's 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity14 in the first leg in the same round last year but the home side still faces an uphill task of eliminating the defending champion			1
" it was good , " @entity10 manager @entity23 told @entity24			2
" i think we started well with a good rhythm in the game and a good attitude and then after the first goal the game was easier			0
" we did n't need to push to score and we controlled the game well			2
at the end the victory was good for us			0
" @entity10 -- bidding to become the first club to retain the title in the @entity13 era -- won for a 10th straight time in the competition to equal @entity40 's record , although the early stages of the contest favored @entity14			1
indeed in the battle of @entity47 coaches who have lifted the @entity13 trophy , @entity43 and his team bettered @entity23 's troops for the first 25 minutes			2
@entity14 neutralized the attacking trio of @entity4 , @entity51 and @entity52 , with @entity53 forced to dive to keep out @entity56 's long range effort			1
@entity10 took the lead in the 26th minute when @entity4 headed @entity59 's cross past an out of position @entity61 -- and was never really troubled thereafter			1
buoyed by his goal , @entity4 attempted a bicycle kick moments later and then saw the inexperienced @entity61 soar to his right to repel his free kick			2
a vital interception from the 19 - year - old @entity61 foiled @entity51 's bid to set up @entity4			1
" it is clear that @entity4 lives to score goals , " @entity23 was quoted as saying by @entity69			2
" it 's never a problem for us when he does n't score for a couple of games			0
but he , of course , minds			0
" not one to sit back and protect a lead , @entity10 continued to race forward in the second half			2
a poor touch from @entity4 near the box prevented a chance but @entity84 should have done better when @entity51 's clever flick sent the @entity87 international in all alone in the 72nd minute			0
having barely tested @entity53 , @entity14 caught the @entity10 defense napping in the 74th minute and almost equalized			1
a long ball over the top found its way to @entity92 , whose layoff fell perfectly to @entity94			0
@entity95 -- in for the injured @entity56 -- struck the crossbar			0
@entity9 settled the affair -- and probably the tie -- when he sent a rocket into the top corner with his right foot , not his favored left , in the 79th minute			0
he exchanged a hug with a joyous @entity23			0
" we are not used to seeing @entity9 score with the right foot , so for this i was really surprised , " @entity23 told @entity24			1
@entity23 then laughed when it was suggested to him that @entity10 was under less pressure in the @entity13 this season because it captured a 10th title -- or ' @entity110 ' -- last year			1
" the pressure is the same , " he said			0
" last year we spoke of the ' @entity110			0
' this year it 's about ( an 11th title ) so the pressure is the same			0
" in wednesday 's other game , @entity112 and @entity113 played to a 1 - 1 draw in @entity116			1
@entity112 scored with its lone shot on target in the 11th minute thanks to @entity119 but @entity113 -- which had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half -- earned a valuable away goal through @entity125 's penalty in the 79th .			1

@entity10 defeats @entity14 2 - 0 in the @entity13
@entity4 and @entity9 score for @entity10
@entity10 wins its 10th straight game in the competition
@entity112 and @entity113 drew 1 - 1 in the other game wednesday
