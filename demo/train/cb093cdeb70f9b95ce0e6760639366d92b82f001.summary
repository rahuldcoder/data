editor 's note : actor and director @entity2 has appeared on film in " @entity7 , " " @entity8 " and " @entity9 " and on television in " csi : @entity10			1
" he co-founded the @entity12 in @entity13			1
actor @entity2 says we ca n't do enough for veterans who sacrifice to protect @entity17			1
( @entity18 ) -- a while back , a friend of mine suggested that i take a look at a film that a buddy of his had made about his two brothers serving in @entity26			1
having spent some time there myself , i was eager to see it			1
once i did , i wanted to do all i could to help the filmmakers find a distributor and get this wonderful film into the theaters			1
i was honored to be asked to come on board as executive producer of the film , " @entity39 , " an honest and inside look at our military service members			1
it 's told through the point of view of one brother who is in search of answers as to why his two younger brothers are serving in @entity26 and what they and their families are doing during these long deployments			1
i got involved with the film " @entity39 " because i believe it shows a side of our military that is rarely seen			1
the call to duty that many of our military members share is depicted in the film through @entity62 and @entity63			1
they are the two brothers who @entity65 , the filmmaker , travels to @entity26 to see in order to experience for himself why they serve and what they are doing while deployed away from their families in this dangerous environment			1
it makes me proud to know we have such men and women willing to give so much in defense of our nation			1
i felt compelled to support this film because , on the many tours i have been on in support of our troops , i have met so many service members like the two @entity63 brothers in the film			1
@entity62 and @entity63 are military men			1
they are both called to serve their country and have endured great hardship			1
yet they continue to serve and to serve honorably			1
and through them , @entity65 is introduced to other members of the service -- soldiers serving on the @entity96 border and @entity97 training an @entity26 platoon			1
@entity65 takes his camera into the middle of a firefight where the @entity26 troops are ambushed and fight back			2
this footage is unlike anything we have ever seen -- an @entity26 unit fighting back and standing up to a terrorist attack and the pride that their @entity97 mentors have in them			2
it is quite moving , and @entity65 captures it all			2
several members of my family have served our country			2
my father , @entity116 , served in the @entity117 in the early 1950s			2
my @entity118 was a navigator on a @entity119 during @entity120			2
my @entity121 served in the @entity122 during @entity120 and my grandfather @entity123 was in the @entity124 in @entity125			2
my wife 's two brothers served in @entity128 and my wife 's sister served for 10 years in the @entity124			1
her husband , @entity118 , served as a medic in @entity128			2
while serving there he wore his dog tags on a rosary with a @entity137 medal			2
i wore that same rosary and dog tags as my character , " lt. @entity140 , " in the movie " @entity7			2
" i remember all too well what it was like for our returning military members during the @entity128 conflict			1
they were caught in the middle of a very divided nation and not only did they have to endure the scars of battle , but upon their return they also were spit on and shamed and ridiculed for their service			0
some decided to take off their uniforms in the airport bathrooms when they arrived home so as not to be identified with serving in @entity128			0
we can never let that happen again to these men and women who serve this country			0
they should be able to wear their uniforms proudly			0
they fight and sacrifice in ways that very few of us can imagine			0
many years ago i got involved with @entity128 veteran support groups in the @entity13 , @entity173 , area			0
after september 11 , 2001 , once we started deploying our troops to @entity176 and @entity26 , i began a mission to let them know that they are supported and that there are people out there who are grateful for their service			0
for over 35 years , we have had an all - volunteer military			1
this is a good thing			0
we want people to serve this country who want to be there and who do it of their own free will -- not because they are drafted and forced into it			0
we are lucky we have such people			0
what would we do if no one wanted to serve to defend the freedoms we all enjoy ? and so , i feel the need to do what i can to thank them for that service in order to help keep them strong in tough times			0
you would be amazed at what a simple thank you will do			0
i have been to @entity26 four times now , @entity176 once , and many many other places as well , all to show support of our troops			0
my goal is always to cover as many miles as possible and to take pictures , sign autographs and shake hands with as many troops as i can in the time i have			0
trips have included bases in @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and in @entity26 -- @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity224 airbase , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228			0
over the last six years , i have traveled around the world and all over the @entity17 with the @entity230 to visit and perform with my band , the lt. dan band , for our troops			0
i have supported many grassroots troop support efforts as well , and visited our wounded in the hospitals several times			0
i could not be more honored to play a small part in helping our troops and their families			0
we can never do enough for our veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep this nation free			0
but we can always try to do more			0
it is my goal to continue to visit our troops , wherever they may serve			0
it is the least i can do for the men and women who continue to do so much for our country			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

he says " @entity39 " shows side of military rarely seen
