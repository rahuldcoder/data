-- fall tv can be so hit ... or @entity2 and like it or not , it does n't take long for both viewers and networks to make the call			1
there have already been some surprise hits such as " @entity10 " as well as some casualties : both @entity12 's " @entity13 " and @entity14 ' " we are men " were canceled after only two episodes , and there are surely more shows to follow			1
update : since this story was first published , there have been some developments			0
according to @entity22 , @entity14 has ordered full seasons of " @entity24 , " " @entity25 , " and " @entity26			0
" meanwhile @entity28 has canceled " @entity29 " and " @entity30 , " @entity27 reported			1
let 's take a look at how some of the network shows are faring : hits " @entity10 " ( @entity36 ) -- this is one hit few saw coming			1
fans appear to love it , and @entity41 called it the " best new show			0
" " @entity44 " ( @entity28 ) -- @entity45 is killing the game as a master criminal in this new drama			1
the show might also be benefiting from its lead - in , " @entity51			0
" either way , people are watching			0
" @entity54 " ( @entity12 ) -- this widely anticipated @entity56 production had a huge premiere but has slowed just a tad in recent weeks			1
it 's still big though , especially with the dvr set			1
" @entity61 " ( @entity12 ) -- so far , so good			1
ratings have been decent , and this comedy might just swing a second season			1
according to @entity22 , more scripts have already been ordered			0
" @entity24 " ( @entity14 ) -- @entity67 and @entity68 make a killer ratings combo , it seems			1
this sitcom starring @entity71 and @entity72 appears to be pretty solid			0
the @entity73 says it looks like a winner			0
a full season has been ordered			1
" the @entity25 " ( @entity14 ) -- lucky show			1
its lead - in is the ratings juggernaut " @entity80 , " so , yeah , it 's doing well			1
like " @entity24 , " @entity14 was pleased enough to order a full season			1
" @entity82 " ( @entity83 ) -- the " @entity85 " spinoff is getting respectable ratings and has had additional scripts ordered			1
@entity0 's @entity88 misses " the @entity90 " and " @entity91 " ( @entity28 ) -- these two are grouped together because they have much in common : the return of two beloved actors , @entity95 and @entity96 , and the fact that both , surprisingly , appear to be struggling			1
@entity99 listed them on their " 10 @entity100			0
" " hostages " ( @entity14 ) -- this one does not have the ratings tied up			1
do n't look for it to make a second season			2
" betrayal " ( @entity12 ) -- proof that not every show built around a mistress will work			2
according to @entity111 , ratings are down , and some critics wonder if it will be the next series to be canceled			2
" @entity114 " ( @entity12 ) -- not every movie actor 's foray into television is going so well			1
we are going to go ahead and list this one starring @entity119 as " dead show walking			0
" " @entity30 " ( @entity28 ) -- if you did n't get to know the family it 's too late , as @entity28 has announced its cancellation			1
" @entity26 " ( @entity36 ) -- all the elements are there			2
the comedy stars @entity128 and @entity129 and was created by @entity130 , the mind behind hits such as " @entity132			2
" so why is it not working ? still , @entity14 has ordered a full season			2
" @entity29 " ( @entity28 ) -- the reboot of this classic series with @entity137 starring as a paraplegic was called the " worst new drama " by one critic			2
@entity28 recently decided to cancel the show			0
so - so " @entity143 " ( @entity36 ) -- this one feels very " @entity145			2
" it 's a critical darling , but ratings have not been overwhelming			2
we are rooting for you , @entity150			0
" @entity151 " ( @entity12 ) -- this one has us a little worried			2
the big budget fairytale series occupies the thursday 8 p.m. slot , which puts it opposite @entity14 ' popular " @entity80 " and @entity28 's fan favorite " @entity145			2
" that time slot could spell doom			0
" @entity159 " ( @entity12 ) -- it should have been a surefire hit , coming after " @entity161			0
" and while lots of viewers tried it out initially , declining ratings in week two indicate they were n't too impressed			0
no bueno for star and creator @entity167			0
" @entity169 " ( @entity83 ) -- the paranormal series is hanging on ... for now			0
" @entity171 " ( @entity12 ) -- critics seem to love it , but ratings have not been overwhelming			0
@entity12 has said the show recently pulled in 1.3 million more viewers than @entity36 's " the @entity177 " ( 2.8 million ) , and the network has ordered more scripts			0
that 's good , as it probably needs more time			0
" dads " ( @entity36 ) -- this live - action @entity183 comedy has been called racist and sexist , but the controversy has not stopped the network from ordering more scripts			0
tell us what your favorite -- and least favorite -- shows have been so far ?			1

" @entity10 " and " @entity44 " are among the season 's hits
favorites @entity95 and @entity96 are struggling with new shows
