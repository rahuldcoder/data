-- with an unexpectedly big gross of $ 24.6 million , according to sunday 's early estimates , @entity2 's kidnapping thriller " taken " was the easy victor at the box office on this @entity7 weekend			1
@entity2 stars in @entity9 's " taken , " which debuted at no. 1 this weekend			1
that 's a particularly impressive feat for a male - baiting film whose key audience has had plenty of distractions during this national football holiday frame			0
to be sure , the movie drew an @entity19 review from a crowd that was nearly three - fifths men and 70 percent over the age of 25 -- an almost exact mirror of the big game 's core demographic			0
for @entity2 , who has n't starred in a major @entity27 release since 2005 's " @entity28 " and " @entity29 : @entity33 " ( to which he lent his voice ) , this is a nice turn of events , indeed : the $ 24.6 million premiere is the fifth best of his career , and , really , the top debut ever for a flick featuring him as a solo lead star			1
certainly , " @entity45 's " weekend sum could decrease slightly after the @entity7 is played tonight and the actual final friday - to - sunday box office figures are calculated , but the film has no chance of falling out of first place			1
that 's because its next closest competitor was two - time champ " @entity53 : @entity54 , " which brought in $ 14 million and fell to no. 2			1
with $ 83.4 million in the bank to date , the @entity57 comedy is basically assured of becoming the first 2009 release to gross $ 100 million			1
" @entity64 " ( no. 3 ) was next , with a decent $ 10.5 million -- exactly the kind of first - weekend number that all @entity63 horror remakes seem to get these days			2
" @entity66 " ( no. 4 with $ 8.7 million ) and " @entity67 " ( no. 5 with $ 8.6 million ) rounded out the top five			2
( at $ 110.5 million and counting , " @entity67 " is now the top - grossing movie of @entity70 's career			2
) and the other big new release , the @entity73 comedy " @entity75 " -- the kind of female - friendly counterprogramming that studio bigwigs typically expect to do well on weekends like this -- got little love at no. 8 , earning just $ 6.8 million			2
among @entity81 nominees , " @entity85 " once again fared best , banking $ 7.7 million at no. 6 , while all the others fell outside of the top 10 ( i.e. they all banked less than about $ 3.7 million a piece )			0
that result is a tad disappointing for " @entity88 " and " milk , " as both movies expanded somewhat wide this weekend ( they grossed $ 2.4 million and $ 1.4 million , respectively )			0
overall , the cumulative box office was essentially flat with the same frame a year ago , when the @entity96 / @entity95 concert film came out of nowhere to be the big winner			0
just like the @entity98 will do tonight			0
