-- for @entity1 , the night was the payoff , the pinnacle , what you work most of your life for			1
it was the @entity7 state high school soccer championship , and @entity1 , a senior on the underdog @entity8 , had state power @entity10 in his sights			1
it was halftime , tied 1 - 1 , thanks to @entity1 's chip shot over the @entity10 keeper			1
in the stands on the night of february 9 were his proud parents , @entity20 and @entity21			2
" we were having a blast , " @entity22 said later			2
we 'd just seen @entity1 make a goal			1
it was the happiest moment of our life			0
" if the @entity30 could pull this off and win their first state championship , it would be thanks largely to @entity21			1
she was the one who introduced @entity1 , @entity35 's star and last year 's @entity37 high school player of the year in @entity7 , to the sport when he was just 7			1
she was the one who spent hour after hour with @entity1 , working on his game when he needed to catch up with the other boys			1
" i was n't that good at soccer , " @entity1 said , explaining that his playing time was limited to three - minute spurts so the better players could catch a quick rest			1
so mom was there with support and encouragement			0
" she helped me practice by myself at the park , " @entity1 , 17 , said			1
" my mom taught me about resiliency			0
and how you would get nowhere without having a good work ethic			0
" about 10 minutes into the second half , the game stopped and an ambulance was rushed onto the field			0
@entity1 and his teammates waited out the 10 - to 15 - minute delay before the ambulance rushed off			1
@entity1 assumed it was a @entity10 player who 'd hurt his back earlier in the game			1
when he saw that player back on the field five minutes after the game resumed , he figured the paramedics had made a wasted trip			0
" i thought the ambulance just came for nothing , " @entity1 said			1
" i thought the ambulance came and went to the hospital with no one in it			0
" @entity35 coach @entity73 knew differently			2
@entity74 was in that ambulance , and the last person she wanted to know that was @entity1			1
in the stands , @entity22 had looked at his 52 - year - old wife and spotted trouble			0
" she looked at me and she said , ' i feel a little bit dizzy , ' and i noticed her left arm and her left leg were dragging			0
and i just looked at her and i said , ' smile			0
' she looked at me like i was nuts			0
she tried to smile , but the left side of her face did n't move			0
" @entity22 had just recently read about the signs of a stroke			0
he called 911 , over @entity21 's protests			2
" she was just getting mad			0
' do n't call an ambulance ; do n't stop the game			0
' i 'm like , ' you can be mad at me and try to live			0
i 'm going to call the 911 , ' and i did , " @entity22 said			0
but she was adamant that whatever was going on with her , @entity1 should stay on the field			1
" it was the mom 's wishes as soon as she went down , ' do not tell @entity1 , ' " @entity73 said			1
what happens during a stroke the game resumed , and @entity10 soon took a 2 - 1 lead			0
" as @entity8 , we do n't give up , " @entity1 said later			1
" we came back strong as usual			0
" when good things happen , @entity1 always says " we			1
" " he 's the most unassuming star , " says @entity106 , one of @entity1 's longtime coaches			1
" if you were to ask him who are the best three kids on the team , he would n't even name himself			2
" but that was n't one of three other players streaking around the @entity10 defense for the tying goal			0
and , after the game went to overtime , and then penalty kicks , to decide the @entity7 state champion , that was @entity1 blasting the ball into the upper right corner of the net on @entity35 's final shot for the deciding margin			1
" i was crying because i was so happy , " @entity1 said			1
and then his coaches came over			0
" i saw their faces and i knew something was wrong , " @entity1 said			2
" when coach told me about my mom then i just broke down with tears of sadness , " @entity1 said			1
" i was happy and then i just got really , really depressed			0
" " it was tears of joy to utter heartbreak , " @entity73 said			0
@entity74 wanted her son to enjoy all that comes with a state championship in @entity7 , the trophy , the medals , the leis that are heaped around the winners ' necks			1
but when @entity1 's name was called , he was n't there			1
things were n't looking good at the hospital , and @entity1 was rushed there			2
his mom was unconscious , but she 'd gotten the news from the soccer field			2
" the last thing she was told was that we won the state championship , " @entity1 said			1
two days later , @entity74 died			0
before that , @entity1 said he got to have one last word with the mother who had gone to every game , who had cooked meals for him and his teammates , who had recorded videos of him and made highlight reels and posted them on @entity166			1
" i wanted her last thought of me to be that i loved her , and that i would be a good boy , and that i know she 's going to look over me and that we 're going to meet again someday , " he said			2
" somebody asked me once , ' what 's the best sound in the world ? what 's the worst sound in the world ? ' " @entity22 , 48 , said			2
" the best sound in the world is @entity1 's laugh , but the absolute worst sound in the world is him crying over his mom when she 's dying			1
" @entity1 takes solace in the fact that his mom leaves behind something beyond her husband and son			2
she was an organ donor			0
" she 's going to save five people 's lives , " @entity1 said			1
" and with her corneas people will see			0
" @entity1 said he 's going to do the same , that he will check the organ donor box on his driver 's license			1
and he 'd like to go to college to study nursing and hopes to play soccer			2
he knows that would mean a lot to his mom and those around him			0
" he brings me to tears , " @entity106 said			0
" i know that he never asked to be a role model , but he is such an amazing role model			1
" @entity74 was the family 's provider			2
