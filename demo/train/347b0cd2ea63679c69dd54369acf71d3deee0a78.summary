a fleet of tiny satellites released from the @entity2 could be a tool to help solve future aviation mysteries like the disappearance of @entity6 , said retired astronaut @entity7 , who commanded the space station for five months last year			1
speaking to the media after giving a talk at the opening session of the @entity13 conference monday , @entity7 said that the shoebox - sized satellites , once fully deployed , will cover the entire planet with frequently refreshed images at a resolution down to 4 meters and could have helped in a mystery such as the question of what happened to the @entity22 @entity21			1
@entity23 , a @entity24 - based company , arranged for the first group of the satellites to be released from the space station last month			1
@entity7 said those satellites are in initial testing			1
asked by @entity30 to comment , @entity23 provided a statement by its co-founder and ceo , @entity34 , a former @entity35 scientist , who is due to speak later this week at @entity13 : " @entity23 just last month deployed a fleet of 28 satellites , flock 1 , from the @entity2			1
this is the largest @entity40 imaging constellation in history			0
we are turning on each of the satellites and are now putting them into position			0
with this constellation , we will measure the planet on a more regular basis to enable various applications			0
one of those applications is disaster response , including natural and man - made disasters			0
other applications range from monitoring deforestation to helping to improve agricultural yields to monitoring urban growth			0
" another 100 such satellites are in the works , according to the @entity59			0
@entity7 said " tracking one thin aluminum tube " like the @entity21 , in a place that is not heavily covered by radar is very hard			2
" obviously something happened fast and deliberate , exactly what process , whether it was the crew themselves or someone forcing themselves in , we do n't know , " @entity7 said			2
he said he suspects that if the aircraft did crash , wreckage will eventually be found			1
how @entity13 got famous in his talk on the @entity13 stage , @entity7 gripped the audience 's attention with a message urging people to conquer irrational fears , with images of the @entity40 's beauty from space and with a performance on guitar of a portion of @entity87 's " @entity86 , " a song he also sang while weightless on the space station			1
his video , one of about 100 he shot on the space station , went viral			1
astronauts train themselves to overcome fear , and thus are willing to take considerable risks , whether being launched on a rocket or walking in space , @entity7 said			2
by contrast , some people will let themselves be paralyzed by unreasoning fear of spiders ; the way to conquer that is to walk through spider webs ( assuming the spiders are n't venomous )			0
" there 's a difference between danger and fear , " he said after the talk			0
and @entity7 said that , incongruously , " i 'm afraid of heights , " but had mostly overcome it through training .			2

former space station commander @entity7 : new satellites could help locate planes
first of shoebox - sized satellites released last month from the space station
@entity23 , a @entity24 company , says they will provide *unprecedented* imagery
@entity124 : if *flight* *370* crashed , wreckage will eventually be found
