-- greetings , everyone ! it 's a great day for baseball			2
we 've got a great battle for you today between two of the heaviest hitters in the baseball video game universe : " @entity14 " ( @entity11 ) and " @entity13 " ( @entity12 )			1
both of these popular annual titles have retooled their lineups with some new additions this season			0
so in honor or baseball 's opening day thursday , we match them up , feature by feature , in a nine - inning smackdown			1
here we go : 1st inning -- pitching : both titles use buttons to select the type of pitch and the right analog stick for the delivery			2
" @entity14 " is a simple pull - back , push - forward motion with the analog stick for the velocity and direction of the pitch			1
the more you use a pitch , the better it becomes			0
a sliding bar indicates the best time to go from back to forward on the stick for optimum accuracy			0
" @entity13 " uses the left stick for direction and right stick for a series of movements that correspond to the type of pitch you select			1
for example , a cut fastball might require a move to the left followed by a sweeping motion down			0
your success is based on how well you time the power of the pitch and how accurate you are with your analog movements			0
for ease of playability and not feeling like i have to contort every pitch , " @entity69 " scores first here			0
2nd inning -- hitting : analog hitting is something both games do , but again , there is a difference in the execution			1
" @entity13 " uses the left stick to indicate the direction you want to try to hit the ball and the right stick to make contact			1
a simple swing is a push forward and a power swing is pull back , then push forward			0
@entity87 is done with the square button			0
@entity89 hitting on " @entity14 " is all done with the right stick			1
you can decide if you want a normal swing or power swing by using the circle or square button , respectively			0
pull back on the stick to have the player stride and then push forward to swing			2
@entity87 is just a push forward motion			0
both are easy enough to use , although i can not figure out if there is a timing to striding that helps hitting with " @entity14			1
" however , check swings are a bit easier with the stride , so i 'm giving one run each to both games			2
3rd inning -- fielding : fielding in the games is identical			1
move the left stick to get your player in position and use the correct buttons ( or move the right stick if you are doing analog controls ) to throw to the proper base			0
while fly balls in each game use a circle shadow on the field to indicate where the ball is traveling , " @entity13 " changes things up a bit by utilizing a second circle inside the shadow to more precisely tell you where the ball is coming down			1
that second circle changes in size depending on the fielding rating of the player trying to make the catch			0
the better the fielder , the smaller the circle			0
for that , " @entity13 " gets a run			2
4th inning -- players : each game is associated with the @entity143 , so almost all of the majors ' current players are in the game , and their likenesses are recreated in digital format			1
the rosters are updated online , but when i tried to get the latest @entity153 roster , " @entity14 " did n't include offseason acquisition @entity154 in the lineup while " @entity13 " did			1
i did find @entity157 in the free agent pool , however			0
both games try to recreate a realistic look and feeling with their digital players			1
" @entity14 " seemed to do a better job at portraying facial features and reactions without being repetitive			1
" @entity13 " had a couple instances where players would have sunglasses on while walking up to the batter 's box , then suddenly lose them when they stepped in			1
also , " @entity13 " would sometimes repeat the same player motions over and over after every pitch			1
movement in the field felt more natural with " @entity14 " with fluid action and no noticeable hiccups			2
" @entity13 " had more than a few glitches when transitioning from fielding to throwing , but nothing that took away from actual game play			1
" @entity13 " gets a run for the roster update out of the box , while " @entity14 " gets 2 for a better look for the players and smoother animation			1
5th inning -- stadiums : both games do a great job rendering all 30 major league parks with all the identifying quirks and traits that make each different			1
and both also have generic - looking minor league ballparks			2
since there is no real difference between the two games here , i awarded no runs this inning			2
6th inning -- living the dream : each game has a mode that allows you to create a player and take them from aa rookie to the @entity211			1
" @entity13 " my player mode provides a mentor that tells you what you need to work on in the minors to get your call - up to the bigs			1
skill points can be earned during each at - bat , fielding chance or running opportunity			0
increase your skills enough , and you earn a promotion to @entity226 or the big leagues			0
" @entity14 " also lets you earn skill points and advance your way through your organization but offers more options when setting up your player			1
you can figure out what type of player you want to be ( contact hitter , power swinger , speedster , etc. )			0
players also receive evaluations and training to make them better and get them ready for the majors			0
i played as a 2nd baseman and an outfielder in both			0
the infield experience was similar , but in the outfield , the camera angle on " @entity13 " sometimes made it difficult to tell where i needed to go to catch the ball			2
it got to be really frustrating at times			0
so " @entity14 " scores a run this inning			1
7th inning -- real life : @entity255 is a game driven by statistics , and virtual baseball is no different			2
" @entity14 " has developed a weather database that attempts to accurately reflect the real weather expected at each @entity262 stadium			2
that weather also affects what happens on the field and each player rating			0
" @entity13 " tries to bring the real game into your virtual game by adjusting player skills as the season progresses			1
if a player in the real world gets on a hot streak , he will experience a hot streak in the game			2
likewise , if he is not playing well , expect his performance to lag in the virtual world			0
so thanks to those in - season adjustments , " @entity13 " gets the run here			1
8th inning -- what 's new ? " @entity13 " has some improved camera angles , a new revamped fielding system and upgraded player models ( although they still could use some work )			1
the interface is better than last year , but still glitchy at times			0
it sometimes missed easy plays or threw to the wrong base			0
" @entity14 " offers a new co-op mode that allows for a variety of options when you 're playing others online			2
the game also supports the @entity298 controller and offers a @entity299 , where gamers can earn points toward prizes			0
and it offers 3 - d functionality on the @entity305 , if you want to see bats and balls flying at you			0
each game earns a run this inning because these new enhancements add value to both			2
9th inning -- bonus items : " @entity14 " has a limited edition @entity318 wireless controller that looks sort of like a baseball -- it 's white and has baseball seams where the left and right buttons are located			1
but it 's only worthy if you have a @entity305			0
" @entity13 " is once again offering $ 1 million to anyone who can pitch ( and record ) a perfect game using specific criteria			1
last year , an @entity331 man won the prize using a spring training roster and game			0
this year , the contest does not actually start until opening day , so the feat may be harder to accomplish			0
let 's award one run for the awesome @entity318 controller and one run for the potential of winning a million dollars			0
and the winner is ... ? final score : " @entity14 " 6 , " @entity13 " 5			1
both games reach for as much realism as they can			0
but overall , smoother animation and player renderings make " @entity14 " a better choice in achieving the feeling of immersion in the game			1
there seems to be more variation in movements and reactions with " @entity69 , " which appears cleaner that " @entity13			2
" that said , the in - season adjustments in " @entity13 " are an interesting real - life addition to your season			1
bottom line : today 's contest was a close call , but either game would be a winner in your collection			1
both games were reviewed on the @entity305 using the dualshock 3 controller			0
" @entity13 " is available on the @entity368 , @entity305 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 and pc			2
" @entity14 " is available on the @entity305 , @entity370 and @entity371			2
both are rated e for everyone and available now .			0

we pit " @entity14 " against " @entity13 " in a nine - inning contest
both games do a great job rendering realistic major league players and parks
each game allows you to create a *fictional* player and take them from @entity390 to the @entity211
it was close , but one of the games *emerged* as our favorite
