-- in november 1961 , few would have realized just how groundbreaking the first issue of " @entity2 " would become			1
the series -- about a group of space explorers given various superpowers after being hit by cosmic rays -- began a new era for @entity9 , signaling the start of their wave of @entity14 characters , including @entity15 , the @entity16 , the @entity17 , @entity18 and many more			1
now , nearly 50 years later , the company has announced that the series ' current story arc , " three " -- the next - to - last issue of which hits stores wednesday -- will result in the demise of one member of the iconic superhero team			1
@entity9 executive editor @entity28 made it crystal clear : " a core character from the series , whom you 've seen in the [ 2005 and 2007 ] films , will be no more , " he told @entity0			1
current " @entity2 " writer @entity36 said that the plot twist grew from a multiyear story he pitched once he started working on the book			1
" everything has led to this moment , " he said			2
" it serves the story and gets where we want for the @entity2			1
" " this was n't a case where we started with , ' let 's kill a character , ' " @entity28 said			1
" [ @entity36 ] had this story , and at one point , he said this character will die			1
there was never a moment where we said it could be this one or that one			2
there was only one choice to us as we headed down this series of stories			1
" @entity28 said this character 's death will have a ripple effect on other @entity9 books			1
" the hook is the fact that one of the four characters will be shuffling off this mortal coil			2
that 's really a small part , " he said			2
" what we 're actually doing is completely transmogrifying the ' @entity74 ' as a thing			1
at the end of this story , there wo n't even be a book called ' @entity2 ' anymore ; there will be something new that will be interesting and exciting			1
out of this moment , a new thing will be born			0
" indeed , @entity9 recently announced that the first issue of a new series called " @entity74 , " subtitled " a beginning , " will hit stores in march			1
this is n't the first time the team has experienced what at least seemed to be a death in @entity9 's " first family			1
" in 1994 , for example , @entity92 , a.k.a. the @entity92 , took over as team leader --- in what was , for a short time , a trio --- when her husband @entity97 , a.k.a. mr. fantastic , was believed to be dead			0
( it turned out he had been ripped out of the time stream			0
) @entity101 , a.k.a. the @entity101 , was briefly thought to be dead in 2004 as well			0
then there was @entity104 's death in 1992 and @entity105 's in 2007 , which made big headlines at the time			0
and as with those characters , most seem to return eventually			0
" @entity112 comics have done these ' death of ... ' stories so frequently , never keeping the characters dead , so it 's lost all meaning to me as a fan , " said @entity108 of @entity109 , who nevertheless said he is really enjoying the current " @entity2 " story arc			1
" look no further than the upcoming ' death of @entity15			0
' of course , it 's not the ' real ' @entity15 , it 's [ the alternate universe ] @entity120			0
" comic book reader / ireporter @entity121 is also not a fan of characters dying and coming back : " it 's like a musician saying they 're retiring and they keep coming back , like @entity129 " in response , @entity36 said the ultimate gauge of its success would be its resonance with readers			0
" i wanted to invert [ the ' @entity137 ' formula ] , to take a book about adventure and science fiction but inject nostalgia into it			0
because that is the way the book feels now , this will resonate , " he said			0
" when you couple that with the fact that all of this was planned in advance and we 're working toward a goal , i feel that we will be confident that we did a good job			0
" " it 's very easy to develop cynicism about the stories we tell , " @entity28 added			0
" the only way to combat and conquer it is to have a story that touches on the humanness of people that has emotional resonance and truth to it			1
the fact of death is something every human being can relate to			0
i would argue that a well - told story of a character 's demise is not necessarily undone by them coming back later			1
" @entity28 went on to say that response from readers to the story has grown over the past few months , due in no small part to the way events have played out			1
" we 've tightened the screws and had each member in a critical life - or - death situation , " he said			2
" once you get to [ the most recent issue ] , you hopefully will have absolutely no idea which character will take the fall because there are dire circumstances and threats that make it unlikely that anybody will get out			1
it 's amazing that all three get out alive			0
" indeed , it 's become a popular guessing game among readers as to which member will kick the bucket			0
@entity108 believes it will be @entity199 , a.k.a. the @entity199 , since his death has not even been hinted at in previous stories			0
( both the @entity199 and the thing are holding down the fort at the team 's @entity204 , which the army of the @entity207 plans to attack			0
) @entity121 is betting that the thing will be the one to perish			0
" he is the one who is the easiest to replace			0
there are not many characters with the powers of the other three , " he said			0
" @entity213 , he 's not a direct part of the family , so he would be the easiest to let go			0
" quite possibly the most recognizable character of the group , the loss of the @entity101 ( known for the catchphrase " it 's clobberin ' time ! " ) , would be especially heartbreaking because he only recently has been able to go back to his normal appearance for one week out of every year			2
at the same time , he appeared in an image released tuesday promoting this spring 's big @entity9 event , " @entity224			1
" invisible woman seemed headed for danger , having told her family that she was leaving to " referee a harmless meeting " about @entity229 , which has turned out to be anything but			0
@entity108 points out another clue , though : " on the cover of ' ff # 1 ' they have three hexagons , two filled in & one clear , which i 'm guessing represents @entity92			2
" as for team leader @entity236 , he 's currently dealing with the planet eater @entity237 , who has reared his ugly head once again , and that 's never good			0
so , who will it be ? we 'll find out with issue no. 587 on january 26 ; and if @entity9 has its way , not a moment before			1
" it will come sealed in a bag , " @entity28 said			1
" i cavalierly called it the ' death shroud			2
' " the black bag with the " @entity2 " logo and a number three has been compared --- even by @entity28 --- to the bag that carried the " @entity255 " issue			1
" in this modern - day internet era , it 's very difficult to keep any surprise a surprise , " he said			2
" another predilection of our core constituency is they like to keep their books pristine			2
it will cause someone real pain to ruin the story and scan it			2

@entity9 executive : " a core character from the series ... will be no more "
next - to - last issue in the series ' current story arc hits stores wednesday
" @entity2 " will continue as a new series called " @entity74 "
issue no. 587 will come in a sealed bag , hiding the cover art , on january 26
