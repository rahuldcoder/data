-- privacy is vital to my sense of self			0
it is as important as breathing ; each breath may be my last			0
so i am acutely aware of how difficult it must have been for @entity9 , ceo of @entity10 , the world 's richest company , to sacrifice his privacy and expose himself to public scrutiny in an essentially homophobic world			1
the fact that a ceo of a fortune 500 company 's decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality made international news on the same scale as @entity21 exposes the persistence of homophobia and hetero - sexism in the @entity25 -- despite the existence of laws to protect @entity29 people in the @entity30 and elsewhere			1
coming out as @entity29 is not an easy thing to do anywhere in the world , even if you are the head of a global company such as @entity10			1
the fallout from such an act is unpredictable , potentially catastrophic and game changing -- and that 's when you 're coming out in a society where there is legislation to protect @entity29 people			0
the international newsworthiness of @entity9 's decision is a reminder of the gulf between legislation and social emotions			2
as i read @entity9 's courageous story , i could n't help but wonder what it would mean for a @entity52 ceo to follow his example now , in the context of @entity55 which challenges the rights of all @entity29 people			1
while i was not surprised by the news about @entity9 ( though not because i had any prior information about his sexuality ) , i did wonder why he had decided to trade in his privacy			0
i also wondered what price he will pay for coming out and what price he may have paid for keeping his sexuality a secret ? what closet has he now opened and what closet will now be forever closed as a result of his coming out ? as these questions played on my mind , i could not help but be thankful that such a figure would acknowledge his sexuality in the way that he has done , especially at a time when countries like @entity52 are effectively criminalizing gay people , with a law banning homosexuality			0
will those homophobic legislators and their fellow promoters of hate now stop using their " gay " @entity80 technologies ? some homophobes are already claiming that since @entity10 was co-founded by the straight @entity83 , the fact that @entity9 is gay will " corrupt " the brand			2
i wonder how many @entity52 or @entity86 ceos are now thinking about acknowledging their homosexuality , even if only to themselves as a result of @entity9 's declaration			1
because coming out is not always about making a public announcement to the rest of the world -- it can just be about being honest with oneself or with those who you truly value in your life -- those who have supported you , but who are unaware of the totality of who you are because of the closet which society has forced so many @entity29 people into in @entity86			1
if we look at @entity9 's trajectory we can see he has always been " out " to those who matter to him , those who supported his growth and those who probably gave him the courage to make his statement last week			0
his decision will mean different things to different people across the world -- it may have more resonance for @entity29 people in the @entity30 and in the @entity25 because of proximity , but his declaration also provides a counter-narrative to @entity30 far - right evangelists and agents of homophobia in @entity86			2
@entity9 's announcement is both a provocation and a reminder that clothes , not human beings , belong in the closet			1
it is a call to action for those in positions of power to come out and be counted : by letting go of their own privacy in order to give courage to millions , the likes of @entity9 are using their privileged position to insist on justice , equality and the right for all of humanity to be recognized and respected			0
who knows , @entity9 's decision to publicly acknowledge that he is gay may be the impetus some of our closeted @entity85 need			0
at present , it may well be career - destroying for a @entity52 or @entity86 ceo to come out in the way @entity9 has done , but they may be inspired to work behind the scenes , to change policies in their organizations , to work quietly with @entity86 governments to reverse the homophobic laws or even to support and commit their @entity160 and @entity161 budget to @entity162 working on sexual minority rights in the country without drawing attention to their own sexuality			1
for me , in @entity52 , someone like @entity9 revealing his sexuality is his own way of aligning his personal identity and privilege with the struggle against the tyranny of the heterosexual majority and the modern pogrom against @entity29 people , especially in @entity86			1
@entity9 represents all that we as @entity29 activists dream of : to have powerful figures use their position to bring visibility to @entity29 existence			2
while one individual making a public declaration wo n't automatically result in a change of policies or laws , each one puts a face to the conversation and helps advance the discourse			0
@entity9 , like the now openly gay @entity195 writer @entity194 , author of " one day i will write about this place , " reminds us all that @entity29 people are here , have been here among us and are contributing magnificently to development			2
@entity9 's courageous action is an inspiration to us all ; but @entity206 's revelation of his sexuality -- earlier this year he published a " lost " chapter from his memoir entitled " i am a homosexual , @entity204 " -- is probably more contextually powerful for us as @entity86			2
i for one look forward to a day when a powerful and respected @entity86 ceo will publicly acknowledge that they are @entity29 , or openly and unequivocally support the rights of @entity29 people			1
for now , we 'll continue to be inspired by @entity9 and @entity206 's courage			0
