-- for decades , skyscrapers have served as iconic symbols of national pride or flashy trophies of corporate wealth , reshaping the skyline of the world 's major urban centers			1
perhaps in the future , the high - rise superstructures could also help revolutionize the way we travel			0
that , at least , is the fanciful concept behind the @entity15 , a futuristic proposal of two @entity18 - based architects envisaging trains roaring up and down the side of specially - designed skyscrapers nearly as high as the @entity22			1
towering above the crowded streets of future metropolises , these giant buildings are designed to minimize the large slices of real estate that major railway terminals occupy by flipping them on their side			1
the goal , designers @entity32 and @entity34 say , is to free up valuable space in the densely - packed cities of tomorrow , which will be significantly challenged by overcrowding and a sharp drop in public space availability			0
" in 60 years ' time , it will be very difficult for governments to find attractive pieces of available land for public use in the heart of megacities , " says @entity32 , 27			0
" governments will be able to take advantage of such spaces in order to re-adapt the cities ' structure to society needs , " he adds			0
how it works the designer 's vertical station concept calls for a tall cylindrical skyscraper whose small footprint would allow the transformation of the surrounding area into an urban park			1
passengers arriving at the tower would use a lift to make their way up into the platform and from there into their carriage , which could accommodate 10 people sat in two rows opposite each other			0
but , you might wonder by now , how could commuters stay on their feet whilst the train slides in hyper speeds along the huge tower 's @entity78 ? the main idea is that instead of traveling on normal rails beneath , the carriages would be supported by magnetic tracks running up the skyscraper 's exterior			2
each carriage proportion is designed as a cubical shape to enable it to function both vertically , when docked , and horizontally , while traveling after the train 's departure , the wagons would pivot like a " @entity91 , " allowing commuters to remain in an upright position and enjoy breathtaking views of the city			1
connecting cities the radical proposal won the designers an @entity99 at this year 's @entity101 competition , which encouraged people from around the world to propose new ideas for vertical structures of the future			1
the designers say the towers , which would be capped off by a rooftop green plaza , are envisioned as individual pieces of infrastructure that could be replicated in cities around the world			0
the hope is to connect a new hyper - speed network of underground tunnels and overground routes where superfast trains would cover distances of 300 miles in 30 minutes			0
this , they claim , would not only save commuting time and simplify the way public transport is being used , but would also help to cut down co2 emissions by replacing ways of transport powered by fossil fuels			2
" our conceptual design is based upon utilizing existing and viable technologies that can currently be seen in hyper speed rail networks , for example in @entity140 , " says @entity34 , 29 , adding that is a matter of time before we 're able to reach the rail speeds their concept requires			2
" the maglev trains currently travel at 360 miles per hour -- this technology by the 2075 will in no doubt move leaps and bounds from what it already is today , making the hyper - speed trains probably the fastest and safest way of transporting goods and people			2
" of course , there are a number of limitations to the project -- the proposal deals only with stations designed to accommodate city by city travel , not to mention efficiency issues around loading trains in high volume terminals and connecting train routes			1
yet , like in most futuristic transport proposals , practical details are best to take a back seat for now to allow us to enjoy the thrilling ride -- that is , unless you 're afraid of heights .			0

a futuristic proposal flips the *traditional* designs of today 's major train stations vertically
