-- boisterous and uninhibited on screen , comedic actor @entity1 has quietly risen to the top in @entity4			1
five years ago , @entity1 was best known as a comedian on the cusp of a breakthrough ; now he 's dominating the comedy stage and the screen			1
his january film release , " @entity11 , " opened at no. 1 , and there are high expectations for his next movie , " @entity15 , " coming out friday			2
with a devoted fan base and an unrepentant work ethic , the 33 - year - old has quietly transformed into a burgeoning powerhouse			1
how exactly did he do it ? let 's recount : 1			0
@entity22 like with most entertainers , @entity1 is familiar with the valleys that come before finding fame			2
the @entity27 native and one - time shoe salesman initially began performing in the late ' 90s under the name " @entity30 , " but the comedy career he was angling for suffered from a slow start			1
instead of dropping out for good , @entity1 worked with a mentor and re-evaluated his position : he started performing under his own name and began to hit with his brand of loud , physical comedy that drew from personal stories			2
while doing stand - up , he also branched out into acting , landing roles in @entity42 productions such as " @entity43 " ( 2002 ) and " the 40 - year - old virgin " ( 2005 )			1
his 2004 tv series , " @entity46 , " did n't take off , but no matter -- his satiric take on reality tv , @entity52 's " @entity51 , " has been picked up for a third season			0
" the one thing about the business of entertainment is that you have to learn patience , " @entity1 told @entity53 in 2011 after the independent release of his comedy tour , " @entity61 , " did surprisingly well at the box office			1
" the thing with patience is your time will come , there 's just no telling when			0
your job is to be ready when the time comes			0
authenticity a huge part of @entity1 's appeal is his willingness to mine his own fears and foibles for comedy gold , a practice that made " @entity61 " and the 2013 top performer that followed , " @entity80 , " major moneymakers			1
his father 's struggle with addiction , his divorce and ( especially ) his short stature are all topics that @entity1 unabashedly broaches in his routines with a quick and sharp wit			1
" his comedy comes from such a real place , " @entity1 's frequent co-star , @entity90 , told @entity91			2
" and he 's funny as hell			0
versatility what 's made @entity1 such an inescapable presence is his ability to mix up his repertoire			2
he 's become a master of stand - up comedy , executive - produces and stars in a spoof comedy series , can host an @entity106 awards show and is a natural with the raunchy comedy of @entity42 's universe			1
and on the other hand , he can also slip into the family - friendly world of @entity113 's " @entity112 " with ease			0
( yes , that was @entity1 guest - starring as the @entity117 ' neighbor , @entity116 , in 2011 and 2012			1
) from the 2012 rom - com release " the five - year engagement " to the 2013 sports flick " @entity122 " with @entity123 and @entity124 , there are n't many worlds that @entity1 ca n't inhabit			2
cultivating an audience with more than 10 million followers on @entity128 and an eagerness to connect with his fans , @entity1 is the antithesis of the unreachable a-lister			0
this is a guy who was named @entity136 ' sixth - highest earning comedian of 2013 -- but still promises to make surprise appearances at local movie theaters			0
that 's the kind of intimacy that could make fans stick around for the long haul			0
no breaks by his own admission , @entity1 is industrious			0
but you do n't need to hear him say it -- he often uses the phrase , " everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to do the work ! " -- to know that 's true			0
once his 2014 raft of movies is done -- which include " @entity11 , " " @entity154 " and now " @entity15 " -- @entity1 has at least another five projects in the works through 2016			1
