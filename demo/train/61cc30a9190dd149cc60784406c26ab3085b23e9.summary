@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity1 , nobody speaks of terrible things			1
where some unimaginable atrocity has been committed the news is often met with pursed lips , a double snap of the fingers and a swift motion over ones head to invoke a purge against evil			1
to speak of terror is to welcome it into one 's life			1
a terrible thing happened in @entity1 on @entity20			1
in the small town of @entity23 in the @entity24 , 25 students were rounded up a few hours before midnight			1
their names were called out one by one			1
this was no typical roll call , however			1
the owner of each name that was called was swiftly executed by unidentified gunmen			1
no group has yet claimed responsibility			2
however @entity23 is situated in @entity33 which has become volatile of recent , an unwilling hotbed for the radical group , @entity35			1
opinion : @entity1 is a sinking ship , but we must not desert it the cold blooded massacre is one of the worst to hit an educational institution in @entity1 and yet nobody is really talking about it			1
it is not a hot topic at the workplace or on the streets			2
the public mood is palpably apathetic			2
two full days later and the news is only just filtering through to many			2
even where there is a flicker of interest , pursed lips , double finger click , arms raised			2
the federal government has responded typically which is to say that the old book of cliches has been dusted down for frantic recital			2
@entity66 and immediate causes will be investigated			2
the cliches are often peppered with words like probe and investigative and panel			2
read more from the author there is something sacred about learning institutions			2
when one thinks of the more infamous attacks on educational institutions -- @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 -- it is shocking to see there is not a similar outpouring of grief in @entity1 over those who died in monday 's attack			1
the sad truth is that insecurity has now become a constant companion for many @entity1			1
as a result there is no longer any shock value			2
attacks segue seamlessly into more attacks at a pace that makes it impossible to distinguish , digest or mourn appropriately			2
read related : suicide bomb kills 2 at @entity1 church @entity102 has made way for indifference as no one simply knows how to respond anymore			1
one week a church is hit , another a mosque			2
today a newspaper headquarters is bombed tomorrow a petrol station is set ablaze			0
the pattern of violence is predictably indiscriminate			0
the strategy to combat the rising insecurity -- if indeed there is a strategy -- is not a winning one			1
eyewitnesses to the @entity23 killings say the shooting lasted for almost two hours uninterrupted after which the killers casually disappeared into the night			1
the latest attack will once again question the imperative of a regional or state police force			1
the national police system is crumbling under the weight of increased responsibility			0
the argument , which is slowly gaining traction , is that a local police force would have a far greater appreciation of the terrain , natives and nuances of a particular place			0
the current practice of stationing police officers in completely unfamiliar surroundings puts them at an obvious disadvantage			0
however even if a state police system becomes a reality , the long term solution to tackling insecurity must go beyond fighting fire with fire			1
there are more fundamental issues at play			0
the disparity that exists between @entity1 is greater now than it has ever been			1
there are no new interconnecting roads and bridges to reconnect cities and states			0
it will always be easier to maim or kill those that are unfamiliar to you			0
a greater push must be made to plan and budget public spending that will be used to finance the ever deepening infrastructure deficit			0
where idleness exists crime and violence invariably follow			0
the inordinate amount of unemployed @entity1 can be linked directly to rising insecurity levels			1
there is insufficient power to energize the productive energy of the economy			0
cosmetic initiatives such as the almajiri school system , which combines @entity176 and western education , are rubric failures			0
people have to eat before they can learn			0
an empty stomach is the poorest of receptacles for qualitative learning			0
a better initiative would be to establish commodity boards to buy produce at government guaranteed prices			0
this puts money in the hands of the poor rural farmers who are most vulnerable yet paradoxically have the responsibility of feeding a country			0
the human potential of a satiated nation is close to infinite			0
a full belly is the most effective distraction against crime			0
until such measures are put in place the @entity1 society will need to rediscover the ability to police itself			1
the growing number of atrocities is being perpetrated by people indigenous to the area			1
rising insurgency has led to rising insularity			0
neighbors are now regarded with suspicion			0
it is a harsh truth to bear			0
there are killers in the midst of everyday @entity1			1
only a greater acceptance of civic duties ; to observe and report suspicious behavior can expose those that lurk in the shadows yet continue to wreak havoc across the land			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			0
