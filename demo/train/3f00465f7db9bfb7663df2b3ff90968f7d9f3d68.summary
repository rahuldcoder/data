@entity0 , @entity1 -- golfers worldwide generally know @entity0 , @entity1 , for one thing : the masters , and the @entity8 course on which the fabled tournament is played each april			1
the course is arguably the most famous in the world -- and certainly the most exclusive			2
there are no public tours			2
it 's heavily walled off from public view			2
in fact , you could drive past the course without knowing it			2
only the main gate has a small sign that simply reads " @entity8 : members only " ( the last two words in large , bold print )			0
widely considered the toughest ticket in sports , this year 's masters tournament -- and the practice rounds -- are sold out			0
and the lucky souls who are able to get their hands on a @entity32 badge are often willing to shell out thousands of dollars for the privilege			1
so , what 's the average golf lover to do ? there 's little chance of getting into this year 's event ( unless you 're willing to pay a premium )			2
but golf or history lovers can still make a pilgrimage to @entity0 -- about a two - hour drive east of @entity45 -- to check out all the other things the city has to offer and be as close as possible to one of the greatest golf tournaments , and courses , in the world			1
here are the highlights : fine art @entity0 is the second - largest city in @entity1 , so it should n't come as a shock that they have an impressive art museum			1
the @entity57 offers a rare and large ( 5,000 pieces ) collection of work from @entity62 itinerant portraitists , @entity64 impressionists and the works of current and self - taught artists , all of whom depict the @entity64			1
it is the first , though not the only , major museum in the country to devote its collection to @entity64 regional art. one example is @entity77 's " from this @entity80 , " a modern painting of slaves working in cotton fields			1
the ground is tinged with red as skeletal figures hunch over their work , a strong wind blowing their white , drapelike clothes			0
like many of the museum 's pieces , it strikes a chord			0
the museum also hosts special exhibits and events			2
during the masters , golf fans can view the " @entity99 ! images of @entity102 " exhibition , on display until april 15			2
the show includes a @entity106 portrait of four - time masters champ @entity107 and even a painting of @entity110 's character from " @entity111			0
" famous @entity112 @entity113 , the " @entity113 , " was raised in @entity0			1
today you can visit the former radio station where , as a little boy , @entity113 delighted crowds with his dance moves			1
take a photo of his statue in downtown @entity0 near @entity121 or catch a concert at the @entity123 ( formerly the @entity0 - @entity124 and renamed in 2006 to honor @entity113 )			1
and be sure to see one of the most comprehensive @entity113 exhibits in the world at the @entity128			1
it features the icon 's outfits , family photographs , gold and platinum records , and tributes to his music , including an emotionally moving video of the @entity113 performing " @entity139 " in @entity140 with opera star @entity141 not long before their deaths			1
president @entity144 also called @entity0 home			1
he moved to the town as a little boy when his father became the pastor of the @entity150 , across the street from the family 's house			0
as an adult , @entity144 returned to his boyhood home to reminisce about his fondly remembered childhood			1
today the home has been meticulously restored to how it looked when the 28th president of the @entity160 etched his name in the window pane ( which you can still see )			0
tours of the home ( now a @entity166 that has been designated an official " @entity168 " site ) are offered tuesday through saturday			0
other famous people who hail from @entity0 include actress @entity170 , who played @entity171 in " @entity176 , " actor @entity172 , soprano @entity173 and @entity174 , the famous poet and author			1
golf even though you ca n't tee off on the @entity8 , @entity0 has nearly a dozen public courses within 10 minutes of downtown -- some with ties to golf legends			1
for example , @entity183 is an 18 - hole golf course where the likes of @entity187 and @entity188 competed ( not against each other , of course ) in tournaments			2
you can book tee times online			0
the city is also home to the @entity197 golf teams -- last year the men 's team successfully defended their 2010 @entity200			1
the @entity201 @entity0 lies along the @entity202 , which separates @entity1 from @entity203 , and the city has made it a priority to highlight that asset			1
their @entity201 , which began construction in 1986 to help revitalize the downtown area , is now an impressive stretch of red - brick walkways ideal for strolling , jogging or attending one of the many events hosted at the @entity214			2
it 's flanked by hundreds of trees and landscaped with flowers that set off the blue waters of the river			0
history beyond the @entity113 display , there are two golf - themed exhibits at the @entity128			1
one of them has an official masters ' green jacket on display , given to the museum 's director by @entity8			0
there 's no word on who wore it ; all that 's known is it 's a 39 long			0
other exhibits e include the evolution of golf equipment , the biographies of golf greats who changed the sport , and the courses that made @entity0 a golf destination			1
the rest of the museum is worth a look , too			0
dining @entity0 , like many @entity64 cities , has plenty of food options			2
the oldest restaurant in town is @entity254 's , an authentic @entity140 joint great for a family outing			0
golf fans will appreciate their collection of @entity260 's badges			2
interested in gourmet tacos ? get ' em at @entity263			0
and you 'll want to splurge on @entity265 , the new gastropub in town that serves up some seriously good eats			0
with its farm - to - table feel , you can expect to find fresh and inventive food			0
who knows -- you may even see a pro golfer sitting at a table somewhere in town			0
just do n't expect to see the @entity277 without a badge			1
if your appetite for the famous course has merely been whetted , try scoring practice round or daily tickets for next year to see the exclusive club firsthand			0
apply for a chance at access starting may 1			0
once inside you can enjoy $ 1.50 pimento cheese sandwiches and $ 2 beers			0

@entity277 is off limits without membership or a pricey badge
but the city that hosts the @entity32 has more to offer than golf
the @entity57 houses an impressive collection of regional art
or visit *monuments* to late @entity0 residents @entity113 and @entity144
