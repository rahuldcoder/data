@entity0 , @entity1 -- after weeks of large anti-government demonstrations in the capital , @entity1 prime minister @entity3 dissolved the nation 's parliament monday and called for new elections			1
" i do n't want our country and the @entity1 people to suffer from more losses , " @entity3 said in a televised address			1
" i have decided to dissolve the house			0
" her announcement came as protesters began marching toward her office , known as @entity18 , in the latest effort to put pressure on her administration			0
a day earlier , @entity1 's main opposition party said its roughly 150 members would resign en masse from parliament because they could no longer work with the government			1
" this government is no longer justified to run the country , as this house is no longer justified			0
today we resign to express that stance , " opposition party leader @entity28 said			1
dissolving parliament and calling elections appear unlikely to placate protest leader @entity34 , a former deputy prime minister for the @entity35			1
he has called for power to be transferred to an unelected " people 's council			0
" @entity40 's influence during the weeks of demonstrations , protesters have occupied various government offices			0
the rallies have been mostly peaceful , but clashes between protesters and government supporters on november 30 left five people dead			0
protesters and police , who had confronted each other with tear gas and rocks in parts of @entity0 last week , agreed to a truce tuesday in a show of respect for @entity1 's revered king , who celebrated his 86th birthday thursday			2
protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity40 , the older brother of @entity3			1
that 's an ambitious goal in a country where parties affiliated with @entity40 , who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to @entity1 's rural heartland , have won every election since 2001			1
@entity40 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
the current protests in @entity0 were prompted by a botched attempt by @entity3 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return			2
that move added fuel for critics who accuse @entity3 of being nothing more than @entity40 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied .			2
