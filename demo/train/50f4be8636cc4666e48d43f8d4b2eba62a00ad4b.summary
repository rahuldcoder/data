in the pink - hued streets of @entity1 , @entity2 's " @entity1 , " flags are flying at half - mast : the city is in mourning -- and shock			1
in just over a week , three brutal shootings have left seven people -- including three young children -- dead , and two more fighting for their lives			1
the attacks , two targeting soldiers from ethnic minorities , and the third focused on a @entity17 school , have stunned the country , and left local residents dreading the gunman 's next move			1
" there is a lot of fear , " said @entity22 , crime reporter on the @entity24 newspaper			2
" he has killed three times already , with more victims each time , and people are asking ' what will he do tomorrow ? ' " @entity1 , a pretty city on the banks of the @entity34 in southwestern @entity2 , is best known for its historic old town , universities , churches and galleries , and for being home to aircraft manufacturer @entity40			1
with a huge student population , and workers drawn from across the world to work in companies linked to the aerospace industry , the city is proudly international			0
" i 've always felt very safe here , " one @entity17 - @entity48 resident , who asked not to be named , told @entity49			0
" we love the city			0
it is a charming place , like a village within a city , really , very quaint			0
" we are just shell - shocked by what has happened			0
we ca n't believe it -- it seems so surreal			0
" the drama began nine days ago , with the shooting of an off - duty soldier in @entity1			1
but at first , @entity22 says , no one could imagine the horrors to come			0
" the first death was not unnoticed , but no one had any idea of what was behind it -- the soldier was not in uniform , and it seemed like an isolated incident , " he told @entity49			0
then last thursday three members of a local parachute regiment were gunned down in @entity75 , 30 miles away			2
two of the men died ; the third remains critically ill. police soon linked the two attacks , which involved soldiers from @entity83 and @entity84 backgrounds , and which were carried out with the same weapon , by a gunman who fled on a scooter			1
" that led to questions about the motivation behind the attack , " said @entity22			0
" why were soldiers targeted ? why members of a parachute regiment ? was there a link to our operations in @entity98 ? " with the third attack , on the @entity101 in @entity1 on monday , things became , @entity22 says , " even more troubling			1
" " here we have four deaths , of whom three were children , little children , just three , six and eight			0
the attack seems predetermined , very violent -- the gunman is said to have shot at everything that moved , and again he made his getaway on a scooter			2
" again , the shooting has left local residents questioning the attacker 's motive -- and what else he may be capable of			2
" is the motive simply racist ? is it someone who is attacking minorities ? or is it a terrorist attack ? " said @entity22			0
" and if he was capable of killing three times , in such a way , what happens next time ? " security has been beefed up across the city -- and at religious sites around the country -- and anti-terrorism police from @entity131 have been brought in to oversee the investigation , a sign that the killings are officially considered an act of terrorism , but the gunman remains at large			1
" there is a lot of concern that no one has been apprehended yet -- that 's the big issue for everyone : is this person going to be found ? " says the @entity48 expat , a member of the @entity48 in @entity1 group			1
" but walking around the city , you would n't necessarily know about it -- the streets are still bustling			0
" city authorities have canceled the annual carnival , which was to have taken place this week , both out of respect for the victims and their families , and because of concerns over safety			1
" it 's an amazing statement from the city to say ' there 's no way we can celebrate , ' " said the @entity48 expat			2
it seems unlikely that the city 's residents will feel like celebrating anything until the killer is caught and brought to justice -- until then , @entity22 says , a mood of " worry and incomprehension " will continue to hang over the town .			1
