every gang needs a leader			2
and what has become undeniably clear in recent days is that the de facto leader of the @entity4 is @entity5			1
the @entity7 lawmaker , and potential 2016 @entity9 presidential candidate , appeared on seven sunday talk shows , discussing -- in @entity11 and @entity12 -- the specifics of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he hammered out with three other @entity15 republicans and four @entity16			1
the legislation is expected to be formally unveiled on tuesday			0
this means that , by wednesday , just about everyone will be angry			0
conservatives will declare the provisions of the bill too lenient , while @entity23 will condemn them as too punitive			1
welcome to the immigration debate			2
that @entity5 is at center stage in all this is no surprise			1
he was always going to figure prominently in efforts to revamp the country 's archaic immigration system			1
this is n't because of what you hear from the @entity35 press corps , which is constantly showcasing how little it knows about the immigration debate			1
@entity5 casts a long shadow on this issue not because he is a conduit between the @entity9 establishment and the tea party			1
@entity5 's relationship with that band of activists went on the rocks last year when he warned @entity9 that their rhetoric on immigration was too harsh , commended the @entity49 administration for giving undocumented youth " deferred action " to prevent deportation and declared his support for giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship once the border is secure			1
the real reason that @entity5 matters is because he could well be a bridge between the @entity9 and those @entity23 voters that the @entity9 has done such a masterful job of angering and alienating			1
a new poll by @entity65 / @entity64 / @entity63 finds that while @entity5 is not as popular as democrats like president @entity49 or former secretary of state @entity67 , he is more popular than a lot of other @entity9 -- 23 percent of @entity23 viewed @entity5 favorably and only 12 percent unfavorably			1
more importantly , he has a large reservoir of undecided voters who he might still win over			2
the stakes are high for the 41 - year - old freshman senator			0
by becoming the public face of immigration reform in the @entity15 , an initiative that includes not just enhanced border security but also that all - important pathway to citizenship for the undocumented , @entity5 could make himself more popular with @entity23 voters			1
or , if enough @entity23 decide that they do n't like the details of the final product and consider it to be just as harsh as some of that @entity9 rhetoric that @entity5 has complained about , well , then the whole effort could backfire and wind up making the schism between @entity23 and @entity9 even wider than it is now			1
that second scenario seems more likely now that @entity89 , @entity5 's very capable and well - regarded chief of staff , has taken to @entity91 to leak details of what 's actually in the bill			1
what @entity95 tweeted was a series of conditions and prohibitions that make it clear that -- despite the hysterical rants you hear on right - wing talk radio -- what the @entity4 is getting ready to propose is no " amnesty , " no cakewalk and no giveaway			1
@entity95 wrote : " if enacted , @entity108 ( bill ) will be the toughest enforcement and border security law in @entity111 history			2
" and this : " multiple enforcement and security triggers prior to any legalization and prior to any green card process			0
" and this : " no access to welfare , and tough new eligibility standards to prevent legalization for those likely to require welfare in the future			2
" and this : " @entity15 # immigrationreform freezes illegal population			0
" and this : " no ability to earn citizenship for at least 13 years after bill is enacted , and border security and interior enforcement is in place			1
" you get the idea			0
senators are n't opening the floodgates			2
they 're dropping the hammer			0
it 's also been reported that legal status and eventual citizenship will only be made available to those who arrived in the @entity111 before december 31 , 2011			1
more recent arrivals would be subject to deportation			0
it 's not exactly the kid - glove treatment , but it does stand to make better the lives of millions of people			2
yet some @entity23 on the left are upset			1
one dependably liberal radio talk show host posted on his @entity156 page that -- judging just by what @entity95 had leaked -- what 's coming is a " crappy " bill			1
it makes you wonder what people like this expect from immigration reform -- a benevolent stew of forgiveness and freebies , or an instant makeover from " illegal immigrant " to " @entity111 citizen " with no strings attached ? that is pie in the sky			0
that will never happen , and not just because it would be opposed by @entity9 but many @entity16 as well			2
and if this delicate negotiation falls through because reformers made the perfect the enemy of the good , what 's behind @entity183 ? answer : the status quo			0
an administration that uses local police officers to round up illegal immigrants through the dreadful program @entity189 , where local police submit to federal authorities the fingerprints of anyone they arrest			0
an administration which will , by the end of 2013 , have deported 2 million illegal immigrants -- more than any other in history			0
children are hauled before immigration judges			0
of course , neither side is going to be 100 % happy with any workable compromise			0
solutions are hard to come by			0
but we ca n't set the bar too high			0
because what the government is doing now only creates more problems			0
@entity5 seems to have figured that out			2
a lot of immigration reformers need to catch up .			0

@entity219 : @entity5 is the leader of " @entity4 " on immigration
he says @entity5 could be a bridge between @entity9 and @entity23 voters
@entity5 's support for tough rules on path to citizenship is likely to be popular , he says
@entity219 : liberals who say bill is too harsh do n't realize that looser rules would n't pass
