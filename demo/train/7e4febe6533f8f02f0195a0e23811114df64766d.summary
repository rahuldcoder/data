-- " @entity2 " star @entity0 is back on @entity3 after a short suspension over controversial remarks he made about gays and black people			1
while the right is congratulating itself on winning this battle , it 's actually losing its war on marriage equality			1
but both developments are good for @entity14			0
what do i mean ? simple : while i completely disagree with @entity0 's view on gays , he has the right -- which i defend -- to practice his faith and advocate his political and religious beliefs			0
the debate that erupted after his comments is healthy for our nation			1
if a person espouses views that others find offensive , they should be countered -- not silenced			0
and the right losing its war on marriage equality is also good for our nation because we must eradicate discrimination in all forms			1
to those who do n't understand ( or refuse to understand ) how opposing marriage equality is discrimination , all you need to do is check out three court decisions announced , coincidentally enough , during the same time period that the @entity0 controversy raged			1
first , the @entity44 @entity43 ruled on december 19 that marriage equality would be the law of that state			1
the court declared that " barring individuals from marrying and depriving them of the rights , protections , and responsibilities of civil marriage solely because of their sexual orientation violates the @entity55			2
" then on december 20 , federal district judge @entity56 struck down both @entity58 's statutes and an amendment to the @entity60 that had been approved by voters in 2004 banning same - sex marriage			2
@entity56 found that the state 's " prohibition on same - sex marriage conflicts with the @entity66 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law			1
" @entity56 also interestingly noted that the lawyers opposing same - sex marriage were making arguments that were " almost identical " to those offered by opponents of interracial marriage in the 1960s -- including that each was a " threat to society			2
" while the decision is on appeal , currently gay couples are free to marry in @entity58			0
and then on december 23 , federal judge @entity84 ruled that @entity86 public officials must recognize same - sex marriages when issuing death certificates			0
consequently , gay couples married legally in other states would have the same rights as straight couples under @entity86 law			2
as @entity84 instructively noted , " the question is presented whether a state can do what the federal government can not -- i.e. , discriminate against same - sex couples ... simply because the majority of the voters do n't like homosexuality ( or at least did n't in 2004			0
) under the @entity66 , the answer is no. " let 's be honest : these court decisions are vastly more important than whether multimillionaire @entity0 returns to his reality tv show			0
and keep in mind , while @entity3 lifted @entity0 's suspension , it also announced it would " use this moment " to air public service announcements " promoting unity , tolerance and acceptance among all people			0
" @entity3 : star of ' @entity2 ' is back putting partisan fighting aside , marriage equality will be the law of the land in the future -- it 's just a question of when			1
the @entity14 @entity43 in june struck down the @entity123			0
currently , 18 states and the @entity125 recognize marriage equality			1
that 's up from 12 just six months ago			0
and despite what some on the right will tell you , opinion polls are clear that a majority of @entity14 now support marriage equality			1
astoundingly , adults younger than 30 support marriage equality by a whopping 81 %			1
indeed , the generational divide on this issue could n't be more apparent than when you compare the views of two self - described rednecks on gays : @entity0 versus @entity143			0
while @entity0 likened gays to those who commit bestiality , the much younger @entity143 stated last year : " @entity147 n't nothin ' wrong with bein ' a little gay			0
everybody 's a little gay			0
" the fact that our nation is moving to embrace marriage equality can not come as a surprise to anyone with a sense of our country 's history			1
we are by our nature a progressive nation -- it 's one of the reasons we are an exceptional country			1
true , it may take a great deal of @entity166 , but we move forward			0
we have seen this from the fight for women 's right to vote , to ending segregation , to striking down laws that banned interracial marriage			2
until the day marriage equality is recognized , we can expect to see a vibrant , healthy -- and hopefully respectful -- debate on this issue			1
and that is something we should treasure , because that , too , is one of the reasons our nation is exceptional			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

right wins " @entity2 " battle but losing war , @entity182 says
marriage equality will be the law of the land in the future , he says
vibrant , healthy debate is one reason our nation is exceptional , he says
