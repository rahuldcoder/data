for about a month , @entity0 felt at least 40 years younger			0
@entity0 , 65 , had enrolled in a clinical trial for a drug aimed at women who have low sexual desire			1
there is no treatment available in the @entity7 for boosting the female sex drive , but women like @entity0 hoped that would change with this experimental medication , called flibanserin			1
" it was amazing , absolutely amazing , and it just makes you feel whole , " @entity0 said , recalling her feeling of taking this drug			2
" it makes you feel like a complete woman again			0
" outside such experimental settings , there are no medications available in the @entity7 for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder			1
that 's the technical term for when women have a distressing lack or absence of sexual desire or fantasy			1
up to one - third of adult women may experience it , according to a 2002 study			2
@entity33 seemed like a potential answer for many			0
but the @entity35 has rejected applications to green - light the drug			1
@entity39 , which is pursuing approval of the drug , has appealed the @entity35 's most recent decision , and was scheduled to have a meeting with @entity35 officials on friday , said the company 's president and chief operating officer , @entity48			1
given that the drug has been through numerous , rigorous clinical trials , and so much has been invested in it , the @entity35 's refusal to approve it is a turning point in the field of sexual medicine , says dr. @entity56 , director of sexual medicine at @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 , who collaborated on clinical trials for flibanserin			1
if there is no positive action on the drug , it could spell doom for pharmacological efforts to manage female sexual desire , he said			1
" it will go back to dark ages of saying , ' this is all a relationship problem , ' even though we know it 's not , " he said			2
the @entity35 declined to answer specific questions regarding the matter			1
@entity35 spokeswoman @entity78 said in a statement : " the @entity35 is only able to provide information on approved drug product applications			1
any information on an application that has yet to receive an approval or was denied approval belongs to the manufacturer / sponsor developing the drug			2
" sprouting a drug @entity33 was initially developed by pharmaceutical giant @entity89 , but the company ditched it in 2010 after the @entity35 declined to approve their new drug application , asking for more research , @entity56 said			1
a smaller operation , @entity39 , took over work on the drug in 2011 , and resubmitted an application with 14 new clinical studies , encompassing data on more than 3,000 new patients , according to the company			2
in total , more than 11,000 people have participated in clinical trials for flibanserin , @entity48 said			1
still , the most recent attempt to get flibanserin off the ground failed ; the @entity35 did not approve the company 's revised drug application in october			1
the @entity35 characterized the drug as having a " modest " effect in its response letter , @entity48 said			1
but clinical trial results show statistically significant improvement in the women who took the drug , compared to those who took a placebo , she said			1
" in terms of what we see , i would say ' modest ' is meaningful , " @entity48 said			0
sex is doctor 's life 's work a 2013 study in the @entity127 showed that women taking the drug reported an average increase of 2.5 satisfying sexual events in four weeks , compared to an increase of 1.5 among women using a placebo			1
flibanserin is not a hormonal treatment and does not appear to affect fertility or interact with birth control medications , @entity48 said			2
the drug works by increasing brain blood flow in particular ways , @entity56 said			2
it increases levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenaline , and lowers levels of serotonin			0
side effects of flibanserin include dizziness , nausea , fatigue and sleepiness			2
unlike some treatments for men , flibanserin needs to be taken once a day , every day			0
other options there are other experimental treatments for low female sex drive in the works			1
drugs called @entity163 and @entity164 , developed by a company called @entity166 , have undergone several randomized studies with results that are " very promising and will be published soon , " according to the company 's website			2
a drug called @entity172 is being investigated by @entity173 for both men and women			0
none of these drugs has completed phase 3 trials , which are necessary before approval			0
@entity48 counts 24 @entity35 - approved treatments available in the @entity7 for male sexual dysfunction , including popular drugs such as @entity183 ( sildenafil citrate )			1
for women , it 's zero			0
" a lot of times , the medical community has really put men 's needs first and has n't really addressed women 's sexual needs , " said @entity186 , a sex therapist in @entity187 , @entity188 , who is not affiliated with flibanserin			2
because doctors have no solutions , women have tried less - proven treatments for their low sexual desire , such as diets and herbs			1
none of @entity186 's clients has had success with them			0
she said some women who are n't functioning well sexually would be " open to anything			0
" " i 've had women complain , ' why is n't there a female viagra ? ' " @entity186 said			0
sex drive : it 's complicated sex drive is more complicated for women than for men , @entity186 said			0
there are a lot of factors that could explain a woman 's low desire -- and not all of them are medical , she said			2
lifestyle and relationship issues may come into play			0
having a first child can be a problematic factor for some women ; the adjustment and figuring out how to restructure their sex life can throw off desire			0
@entity186 has spoken to some new mothers who feel they are constantly being asked for something from their body , as if they are " touched out , " but find their lack of desire troubling			0
some couples maintain satisfying sex lives over many years -- but some , over time , go on autopilot and have less and less sex			0
" you have to continue to feed your sexual relationship , and feed your relationship in general , " @entity186 said			0
" a lot of it depends on how much importance and energy you put toward your sex life			0
" sometimes stress is the issue , too , she said			0
@entity186 offers cognitive - behavioral , focused exercises to help women who are distressed about their low sexual desire			1
low sexual desire in women is n't necessarily a problem in menopause or later			1
@entity186 works with many women complaining of low sex drive who are in their 30s and 40s			0
the average age of participants in the flibanserin trials was 36 , @entity48 said			2
@entity0 's daughter is in her late 30s , and she and her friends are having similar problems , @entity0 said			0
her physician friends want a solution for low female sexual desire , too , she said ; they want to be able to offer female patients something besides " i 'm sorry			1
