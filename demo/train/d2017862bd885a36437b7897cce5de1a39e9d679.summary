@entity0 -- @entity2 , the former chairman of the @entity3 and former secretary of state , has come out in favor of eventually repealing the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gay and lesbian service members			1
" in the almost seventeen years since the ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' legislation was passed , attitudes and circumstances have changed , " @entity2 said in a statement released by his office wednesday			1
@entity2 added that he believes the ultimate decision about the policy should be made by president @entity16 , the nation 's commander in chief ; the military 's top brass ; and @entity21			1
" i fully support the new approach presented to the @entity23 this week by secretary of defense @entity24 and @entity25 , chairman of the @entity3			1
i will be closely following future hearings , the views of the @entity29 and the implementation work being done by the @entity31 , " @entity2 said			2
appearing before the @entity23 on tuesday , @entity24 and @entity25 said the military is preparing for a repeal of the policy			0
@entity25 told senators it is his " personal belief " that " allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly [ in the military ] would be the right thing to do			0
" " the question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change , but how we best prepare for it , " @entity24 told senators tuesday			0
" we have received our orders from the commander in chief , and we are moving out accordingly			0

" @entity2 has made clear that his position is about effectiveness in the military , " @entity55 president @entity62 said			1
" his powerful voice for ending ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is a tipping point in favor of the brave men and women who are serving our nation in silence			2
the support of respected present and former military leaders brings us closer to repeal , signaling that we 're moving forward and will get there soon			0
" @entity62 asked opponents of the repeal what they know that @entity2 , @entity24 and @entity25 do n't know			2
" the truth is that there are no more excuses , the death knell for ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' has been rung and now is the moment to send this law into the history books where it belongs			0
