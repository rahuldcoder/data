-- if you 're confused about whether the @entity3 deal is an awe - inspiring breakthrough or a cataclysmic disaster , let me help you : the answer is it depends			1
it depends on what happens in the coming six months			1
and not just six months from now , but what happens between now and then : a period during which @entity3 and the world powers are supposed to abide by the deal they made in @entity15 last weekend and work to hammer out a permanent agreement			1
if the @entity15 deal in its current form becomes permanent because the two sides ca n't get to a final resolution and drag out its current terms ( the six - month period is " renewable by mutual consent , " says the so - called @entity26 ) , then what occurred this weekend will mark a calamitous turning point , triggering a chain of events that brings about the very developments that @entity30 -- and most of the world -- want to avoid			1
if the accord indeed proves to be temporary , as president @entity30 maintains it is , to be followed by a much more stringent agreement that brings a verifiable and credible end to @entity3 's pursuit of a nuclear weapons ' capability , then we can rightly call it a historic turning point , a milestone to progress			1
then , @entity30 and his secretary of state will deserve enormous credit for their achievement			1
for now , however , hold off on the awards			0
the deal has some positive points , but it also has many deeply troubling elements			0
remember : @entity51 has a track record of dragging out negotiations ; negotiations started more than a decade ago			0
and if the six months start to slip , an arms race in the @entity56 is sure to start			1
the @entity58 countries of the @entity59 , including @entity60 and the @entity61 , fear a nuclear @entity3 even more than @entity62 does			1
arabs and @entity64 are historic rivals , even enemies			0
@entity3 's revolutionary regime has a stated purpose of spreading revolution , in direct opposition to the stability and survival of the ruling @entity59 regimes			1
the @entity74 will not sit idly by while @entity3 continues enriching uranium , especially after the world has repeatedly discovered @entity3 operating secret nuclear facilities in the past			2
once @entity60 and @entity3 engage in a nuclear arms race , others will jump in			1
@entity81 has a rivalry with @entity60 ; @entity83 looks askance at @entity81 , and @entity84 will not want to be left behind			0
the entire region will be swept up in a feverish pursuit of nuclear technology			0
if you think adding a nuclear arms race to the extremist ideological maelstrom of the @entity56 is like adding fuel to flames , you are wrong : it is like adding dynamite to a raging fire			1
many people incorrectly describe the @entity26 as a freeze on @entity3 's nuclear program			2
the deal reverses some parts of the program , it freezes others , but it allows progress to continue in two areas			0
the three most significant achievements of the interim deal are the dismantling of the stockpile of 20 % enriched uranium , the stoppage of work in the @entity114 heavy water reactor that could produce plutonium -- another path to nuclear weapons -- and the introduction of more intrusive monitors by @entity121 nuclear inspectors			0
but the accord does not open up the @entity124 facility , where @entity121 monitors have already said they suspect @entity3 is testing ways to weaponize nuclear materials			2
and the deal , most significantly , allows @entity3 to continue enriching uranium up to 5 % purity			1
@entity3 maintains this will become permanent			2
@entity131 has given mixed signals on the issue			0
that is one of the two massive concessions made by the major powers			0
the @entity138 had demanded that @entity3 stop enriching uranium			2
now the @entity140 and the other five countries have implicitly allowed enrichment to continue in violation of @entity121 resolutions			2
in addition , they have started a rollback of the painstakingly built sanctions ' regime			0
the final comprehensive agreement with @entity3 will come only if @entity3 truly has decided to give up on what most of the world believes was a goal of either developing nuclear weapons or getting close enough that it is able to do it in quick order , what is known as " breakout capability			1
" @entity3 's new president			2
@entity161 , most certainly has presented a much more conciliatory face to the @entity163			0
but the real power rests with the @entity165 , ayatollah @entity166 , whose rhetoric remains caustic			0
just last week , as talks got started in @entity15 , @entity166 lashed out at the @entity140 and said @entity62 is " doomed to annihilation			2
" is @entity3 now ready to give up what most countries believe is a nuclear weapons program after decades of investment and after enduring enormous hardship to build it ? if so , a deal can certainly be reached			1
has @entity3 perhaps reached a more limited objective , with significant but not complete progress ? in that case , it will likely try to bring an end to sanctions while holding on to much of the progress			1
if that is the case , negotiations will prove enormously difficult , even impossible			0
or , will @entity3 try to cheat ? whatever the answer , it is imperative that the @entity140 be prepared to call out @entity3 if it finds any violations to the agreement			1
otherwise , @entity30 and the @entity140 risk becoming apologists for the @entity188			1
diplomacy requires negotiating with foes , and this is no exception			0
the @entity3 regime is a serial violator of its own people 's rights			2
it is a state sponsor of terrorism , and it is the principal sponsor of extremist militias , such as @entity198 , and the brutal regime of @entity201 's @entity200			0
if the @entity140 can prevent @entity3 's dangerous regime from achieving nuclear weapons capability -- and not just in the short term ; if it can prevent an arms race in the region , and it can do so without military action , then the @entity15 deal will have proved a triumph			1
we will find out over the course of the next six months			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity216 : whether @entity3 deal a breakthrough or disaster depends on next 6 months
she says if deal is extended beyond then , it will trigger chain of events @entity30 wo n't want
she says @entity58 @entity59 nations *threatened* by *prospect* of @entity3 nukes
@entity228 : if @entity140 can bring deal to a final resolution , it can forestall regional arms race
