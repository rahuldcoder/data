@entity2 is spending the spring in @entity9 , documenting traditions of the country 's diverse cultural groups			1
each week , she reports on her experiences for @entity14 , her personal blog , and for other outlets			0
( @entity14 ) -- i 'm walking the trails of @entity19 , dense rainforest to the right , a river with crocodiles to the left			0
my guide , @entity26 , tells me the trail we 're on is often used by jaguars as an easy path through the forest			1
he points to a paw print in the mud to confirm the presence of the big cats			1
" do n't worry , " he says , " it 's very unlikely you 'll be killed by a jaguar today			1
" " sure , " i reply , " just a little mauling			0
" @entity9 's @entity40 is the only jaguar preserve in the world , 150 square miles of protected rainforest that shelters 200 of the endangered animals			1
other species benefit from the preserve as well , including tapir , peccary , toucans and howler monkeys			2
" how about a hike to @entity51 ? " @entity26 asks , clearly teasing			0
@entity51 is the highest point in @entity9 and requires a permit and a four - day trek under the best conditions			1
" let 's just look for jaguars , " i say			1
" what 's the best way to spot one ? " here are @entity26 's tips			2
next time i 'll follow them , and hopefully spot a jaguar from a safe distance			2

go at night since jaguars hunt nocturnally , they obviously sleep during the day			1

@entity14 : top spots for penguin peeping 2			0
bring an umbrella and a guide the rainy season in june and july is when the cats are most active			1
go with a licensed guide who can track the cats ' prints and droppings			1
park rangers have set up cameras throughout the rainforest to record and observe the jaguars ' behavior			2
they know what to look for			0
guides are available both in @entity96 and @entity97			0
i arranged my visit with @entity100 in @entity97			0
another option is @entity103 's @entity102 outside of @entity96 , with guides that are also trained as medics			2
be quiet this one is hard			0
sitting still , in the dark , in the rain , at night looking for jaguars , i would want to talk to my guide just to stay awake			1
but jaguars are known for their stealth and any foreign noise or scent will scare them away			2

pray maybe a little prayer to the ancient @entity121 of the underworld , @entity123 , will send some cats your way			2
other activities though i did n't see any jaguars ( secretly , i was relieved ; i 've had plenty of run - ins with @entity9 's wildlife : barracudas , a viper , scorpions ) , i did enjoy an entire day at the park walking the trails , which are clearly marked , mapped out , and posted			1
my favorite was the waterfall trail , a rugged hike up a hill that ended under a waterfall with a swimming hole			0
birders can try spotting some of the 290 species that live in the park			0
during the wet season , tubing in the river is also a popular option			0
on my way back to @entity97 , i had time to check out the @entity152 at the entrance of the park , with absolutely no fear of being mauled			0
