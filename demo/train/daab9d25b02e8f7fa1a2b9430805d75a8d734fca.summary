-- @entity1 , who resigned thursday , kicked off his stormy tenure as attorney general with a challenge to the @entity6 public that set the tone for his six turbulent years as the nation 's top law - enforcement officer			1
" though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot , in things racial we have always been and continue to be , in too many ways , essentially a nation of cowards , " said @entity1 in his first public speech after being sworn in			1
when the remark drew an uproar from conservatives , @entity1 shrugged and doubled down			1
" i would n't walk away from that speech , " @entity1 told @entity22			1
" i think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues , " rarely engaging " one another across the color line [ to ] talk about racial issues			1
" and true to form , @entity1 -- a tall man who carries himself with the relaxed , quiet confidence of a corporate attorney -- seldom backed down from a confrontation , on racial justice or other issues			1
he pressed @entity35 , and the @entity37 bank eventually paid over $ 2.6 billion to settle claims it was illegally helping wealthy @entity39 avoid paying taxes			0
@entity1 took the lead in pushing banks and other financial companies involved in the mortgage crisis to pay $ 25 billion to federal and state governments , a record civil settlement			1
and @entity1 famously sparred with members of @entity48 such as @entity49 and @entity50 as the television cameras rolled			1
in one heated exchange at a @entity54 hearing in 2013 , @entity49 and @entity1 talked over each other , with the attorney general concluding , " that is inappropriate and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of @entity48			1
it 's unacceptable , and it 's shameful			0
" in another back - and - forth , @entity1 trash - talked @entity50 with lines that could have been taken from a comedy routine			2
" you do n't want to go there , buddy			0
you do n't want to go there , ok ? " while the history books will note @entity1 was the first @entity6 attorney general , a more relevant biographical fact might be his status as possibly the first attorney general who , as a college student protester , occupied a campus building : in 1969 , as a freshman at @entity76 , @entity1 was part of a group of black students that took over a former naval rotc office for five days , demanding that it be renamed the @entity82			2
( in a sign of the times , the university complied			0
) echoes of @entity1 's activist history could be heard years later , in the middle of a high - stakes battle with leaders of several @entity92 states over voter - id laws and other rules changes that @entity1 deemed at attack on black voting rights			1
" people should understand that there 's steel here , and i am resolved to oppose any attempts to try to roll back the clock , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity98 in an article for @entity100			2
not all of @entity1 's crusades have worked out well			2
the @entity109 , despite @entity1 's efforts , voted to strike down key provisions of the @entity111 , and conservative senators blocked @entity113 , @entity1 's preferred choice to run the @entity115 of the @entity116			2
the attorney general has launched or joined legal battles against restrictions on voting rights in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , but it 's unclear whether those efforts will end up back at the same @entity109 that weakened the original law			0
in 2012 , @entity129 @entity128 voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of @entity48 for stonewalling on information requests in the bungled @entity134 gun - smuggling operation in which 2,000 weapons went missing			1
it was the first time in @entity39 history that a sitting @entity139 member was given such a severe sanction			0
( the case will continue after @entity1 's resignation , although his successor will inherit the fallout , not @entity1 personally			1
) but history will surely judge @entity1 a success at broadly expanding access to justice for groups seeking acceptance and fairness			2
he announced the federal government would no longer defend laws banning same - sex marriage and told state attorneys general they could do the same			0
and @entity1 made good on his initial commitment to change the conversation on race			2
he traveled to @entity158 , @entity159 , and assigned dozens of @entity116 personnel to investigate law enforcement practices after the police killing of @entity164 triggered street riots			0
he has also called for voting rights to be restored to formerly incarcerated @entity39 , and pressed for a reduction in the prosecution of low - level marijuana users			0
for one clue about how history will regard @entity1 , go back to 2009			0
in the effort to battle terrorism , @entity1 called for five accused terrorist suspected of participating in the 9/11 attacks to be tried in federal courts in @entity177 -- only to see the proposal scuttled after a political uproar			0
" we need not cower in the face of this enemy , " @entity1 told skeptical members of the @entity181			0
they did n't buy the argument , but it was classic holder : once again , the battler leaping into the arena and daring others to summon the nerve to fight alongside him .			0
