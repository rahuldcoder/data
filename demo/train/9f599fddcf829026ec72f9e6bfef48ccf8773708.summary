@entity0 came into the mayor 's office in @entity3 as an avowed scourge of corruption and led the city through the worst disaster of its modern history			1
he left a federal courthouse a convict wednesday , after a jury found him guilty of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and other favors from businessmen looking for a break from his administration			2
of the 21 counts against him , he was convicted of 20			1
" he got a lot of media attention as being a reformer , a non-politician , first run for office -- a businessman who was going to come in and get it right , " said @entity20 , a veteran @entity3 lawyer and no fan of the former two - term mayor			2
after @entity32 ravaged the city in 2005 , the onetime cable television executive would reassure people queasy about sending taxpayer money to a state with an epic history of corruption by telling them , " @entity39 me			0
you 're not going to find any of that in my record , " @entity41 said , quoting @entity0			2
" well , @entity39 him now			0
" @entity0 , who left office in 2010 , had little to say as he left the courthouse wednesday afternoon , telling reporters only , " i maintain my innocence			1
" a small knot of supporters yelled , " @entity53 " and " he 's just a patsy , " @entity50 affiliate @entity49 reported			0
his lead attorney , @entity55 , told reporters his client would appeal the verdict			0
" we did the best we could do , " @entity55 said			0
prosecutors argued the 57 - year - old @entity0 was at the center of a kickback scheme in which he received checks , cash , wire transfers , personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city			1
he faces up to 20 years in prison , but @entity41 said a 14 - to 17 - year term was more likely			0
a january 2013 indictment detailed more than $ 200,000 in bribes to the mayor , and his family members allegedly received a vacation in @entity79 ; first - class airfare to @entity82 ; private jet travel and a limousine for @entity85 ; and cellular phone service			0
in exchange , businesses that coughed up for @entity0 and his family won more than $ 5 million in city contracts , according to the january 2013 indictment			2
during the two - week trial , prosecutors brought to the stand a string of businessmen who had already pleaded guilty to bribing @entity0			1
his defense did little to challenge their stories , @entity41 said			0
" it was too painful actually to watch			0
they just swamped him , " he said			0
and when @entity0 took the stand in his own defense , " he did a belly flop , " often answering questions on cross-examination by saying he could n't recall who paid for a trip or perk			1
" he just looked terrible , " @entity41 said			0
the earliest of the charges date from before @entity32 , which struck when @entity0 had been in office for about three years			1
the hurricane flooded more than three - fourths of low - lying @entity3 and left more than 1,800 dead across the region -- most of them in @entity116			0
supporters credited @entity0 's sometimes - profane demands for aid from @entity120 with helping reveal the botched federal response to the storm -- a fiasco that embarrassed the @entity125 administration and led to billions of federal dollars being poured into @entity128 reconstruction efforts			1
but @entity0 also had his detractors : @entity41 called his performance during the storm " a meltdown , " a congressional committee criticized him for delaying evacuation orders , and his frantic description of post-storm @entity3 as a violent wasteland with up to 10,000 dead turned out to be greatly exaggerated			2
as he sought re-election in 2006 , with much of the city 's @entity140 population displaced by storm damage , @entity0 was blasted for insisting that @entity3 would remain a " chocolate " city			1
@entity0 won a second term despite the controversies , but left office with his approval ratings in the cellar and told @entity50 his career in public office was over			1
" i have given my pound of flesh , " he said			0
@entity0 sought to have the charges dismissed in october after another federal judge blasted what he called the " grotesque " misconduct of prosecutors in the @entity160 shootings of unarmed civilians by police at the @entity163			1
the judge tossed out the convictions of five cashiered cops after ruling that members of the @entity170 attorney 's office tainted their 2011 trial by anonymously posting " egregious and inflammatory " comments at online news sites			2
@entity0 argued that he was the target of the same underground effort , citing " a continuum of pejorative statements and demeaning racial epithets " aimed at him			2
the @entity170 attorney 's office said none of the prosecutors involved in the @entity163 case played a role in the @entity0 investigation .			1
