-- the @entity1 will hold a hearing monday as it considers whether to approve genetically engineered salmon for human consumption			2
if approved it would be the first genetically modified animal permitted by the food safety agency			1
a company , @entity8 , has injected growth hormones into @entity11 salmon that enable the fish to reach maturity in half the normal growth time , 16 to 18 months , rather than 30 months			1
the @entity1 in an analysis dated monday , wrote : " we therefore conclude the food from @entity8 that is the subject of this application is as safe as food from conventional @entity11 salmon and that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the consumption of food from this animal			0
" but critics worry about the possible health effects of eating fish containing the growth hormone			1
@entity30 : what does " genetically modified " salmon mean ? " it 's impossible to talk about the risks other than saying they have n't been properly assessed , other than process has been rushed and we do n't know , " said @entity33 , executive director of @entity34			2
she added that the @entity1 is a " very stressed agency " with all the latest recalls and outbreaks , that it " ca n't ensure the safety of the foods they currently regulate			0
" @entity33 said that the @entity1 has relied too heavily on information provided by @entity8 and that there should be a more extended time given to thoroughly vet and discuss risks			0
a final decision is expected in a few weeks .			0

if ok *'d* the salmon will be the first genetically modified animal permitted by the @entity1
