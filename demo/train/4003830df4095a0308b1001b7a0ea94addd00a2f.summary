-- for actress @entity2 , it 's the public 's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series " the closer			1
" @entity2 and her husband , @entity10 , at the 66th annual @entity11 this month			1
but she may be getting more approval from her peers , too			0
@entity2 will walk the red carpet again sunday night at the @entity15 , where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as deputy chief @entity20			1
she 's also won a @entity11 for her performance , in 2007			2
the @entity23 series resumes monday night where it left off in september with what @entity2 called " a fantastic five episodes			1
" ( @entity23 is a unit of @entity28 , as is @entity0			1
) " i said to the writers , ' i really want a lot of personal stuff for @entity20 , ' " @entity2 said			1
" i feel like there 's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone , is something that i 've been missing as an actor , and i feel like the audience has been missing , too			2
" she is such a complicated , fascinating character , and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting , " she said			0
when @entity0 asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character , @entity2 laughed			1
" that might very well happen , " she said			0
" that 's pretty insightful of you			2
i 'm just going to just say that			0
" a marriage for @entity20 would be " a complicated , difficult situation , " she said , because " she 's basically married to her work			2
" @entity2 's job also complicates her real - life marriage to @entity10 , since the show is produced in @entity59 and the couple lives in @entity61 with their two children			1
that 's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has " been a wonderful phenomenon for me , " she said			2
" on a personal level , that 's really good for me , because i really miss my family when i 'm working on the show six months in @entity59 , " she said			0
" as much as i try to get my kids to move to @entity59 and my husband , they just would n't have it			0
