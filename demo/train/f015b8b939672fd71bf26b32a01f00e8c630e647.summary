-- after months of bomb threats at the @entity2 , an anonymous group that calls itself the @entity3 has claimed responsibility for the most recent e-mail threats and announced to the school 's student - run newspaper that it will stop sending them			1
@entity10 , whose term as editor - in - chief of the @entity13 ended sunday , said the paper received an anonymous e-mail friday claiming that the bomb threats plaguing the school since february 13 would end if university officials revoked a $ 50,000 reward for anyone who came forward with information that led to an arrest			1
the paper received a second e-mail saturday , after university officials revoked the reward , saying there would be no more threats , @entity10 said			1
the university has received more than 140 threats since february , according to spokesman @entity31			1
the threats have not yielded any explosives , but the majority of them have resulted in evacuations of dorms , libraries and other campus buildings			1
@entity31 confirmed that the university had withdrawn the reward but would not comment on why it did so			2
the author of the anonymous e-mail to @entity13 said that the @entity3 began sending the bomb threats march 30 because the university issued a reward for " some young kid who 'd pranked the university , " @entity10 said			1
the group said it was not responsible for threats before that date and also said it was not affiliated with anyone who had been " publically identified as suspects			1
" @entity10 said he handed the first anonymous e-mail over to police friday			2
the paper published a report on the e-mail saturday , after a 24 - hour period without any threats , which the anonymous author promised in the first e-mail			1
" we started thinking the e-mail was a little bit more authentic when it accurately predicted that gap , " @entity10 said			2
since the second e-mail promising an end to the threats , no more have been reported through the school 's emergency alert system			1
despite the lull , university officials are restricting final exams , scheduled to start this week , to five campus buildings			1
all of them will be swept for explosives at the beginning of each exam day			2
according to a letter posted on the university 's website by senior vice chancellor @entity82 , any buildings that receive bomb threats will be checked for explosives but evacuated only if law enforcement officials deem it necessary			1
" these arrangements reflect the expert advice we have received from law enforcement professionals , the experience we have gained over the past several weeks , and the special circumstances associated with finals week , " the letter says			2
the @entity95 said in a statement april 11 that investigators were making " significant progress			0
" @entity100 attorney @entity99 said they were focused on " potential suspects			0
" investigators have remained mum on any potential leads			0
an @entity107 spokesman declined to comment on the investigation , and a @entity95 spokeswoman did not return calls for comment			0
@entity112 , 55 , and @entity113 , 22 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , had been subpoenaed in connection with the investigation			0
the pair testified before a grand jury april 17 , according to @entity113			0
@entity113 said @entity107 officials returned to the couple 's apartment the following day and seized their computers , cell phones and other files			0
" i feel very violated , " said @entity113 , who denies any connection to the bomb threats at @entity13			1
@entity113 , who is transgendered , is filing a lawsuit against the university alleging discriminatory treatment after being charged with trespass , indecent exposure and disorderly conduct after using the men 's locker room for a weight - training class during his junior year , he said			0
he said he has since been expelled			0
" i feel that we 're being investigated solely because i have a lawsuit pending against the university , " @entity113 said			0
the @entity107 also seized a server from the @entity143 headquarters of @entity145 @entity144 on wednesday , according to a statement from the company			0
the server was operated by the @entity149 , a provider that runs an anonymous remailer service , allowing people to send e-mails completely anonymously , according to the statement released by may first / people link director @entity154			0
@entity154 added that the server was seized in accordance with a search warrant issued by the @entity107 the previous week requesting all of the information , including ip address , in connection to bomb threat e-mail messages relayed through their servers .			2
