-- why is having an affair worse than being a sexual harasser ? why does a woman 's claim that she had a 13 - year extramarital romance with @entity6 seem to be more deadly to his @entity8 presidential campaign than accusations by several other women that he aggressively pressured them for sex -- behavior that would be not only sleazy but criminal ? @entity6 himself has said that donations to his campaign have fallen off since the adultery allegations			1
this is a far cry from the surge of support that followed the allegations of harassment			1
why is this ? my take is that working women who allege sexual harassment arouse fear in men , especially men who have conservative views about sex , marriage and women 's place at work and in the home			1
the guy in the office in the gray flannel suit fears that his taken - for - granted sexualization of the women in his workplace may be interpreted as harassment when he does n't want it to be			1
he does n't think he 's a bad guy , but ca n't imagine treating his female co-workers like , well , colleagues first and only , and not like ladies			1
he would never dream of harassing someone , and is terrified that the quick little pat on a co-worker 's butt or comment on her appearance wo n't be interpreted the way he means it , as just a sexual compliment			2
he thinks the women in his office might be infected with the crazy feminist idea that a little playing around makes for a chilly workplace climate			1
reports of sexual harassment terrify him -- might he be charged next ? so he denies that such a thing exists			2
the rules really are n't that clear , and besides , he does n't really trust women to tell the truth			2
a consensual affair , on the other hand , is a lot easier to understand			0
it 's sleazy , something that a good tradition - bound husband recognizes and knows he can avoid , so he 's comfortable in holding that against @entity6			1
but whom does an affair really hurt ? the victim in these new allegations , it seems to me , is mrs. @entity6 , and so far , she seems to be the stand - by - your - guy sort of wife			1
and if she is hurt by the charges , she 's not likely to go public with the pain			0
their children too might be hurt , and that too , is a family affair			0
i do n't really care who mr. @entity6 is alleged to have slept with as long as she 's willing			1
this is not the first man who ran for president who has ever had an affair			0
in fact , it might be a good parlor game to try to find one that has n't			0
my guess is that there is n't a strong relationship , historically , between being a good president and never having had an extra-marital affair			0
women simply have n't been that important ; the wives and the mistresses have not been their men 's equal , but merely their mates			2
perhaps that 's changing in the 21st century			0
but i 'm not putting my money on it			0
and whom does sexual harassment really hurt ? every woman who works for a living			1
every time a high profile man gets away with treating women who work with ( or especially for ) him primarily as sexual objects , and not as workmates , every woman who works for a living is reminded that she too is at risk			2
when women make public charges , they go on public trial themselves , with their pasts mined for anything that might discredit them			0
have they ever gone bankrupt or lost a job ? intimate details of their lives are held under the microscope			0
why should their past matter ? the issue is whether a man in authority misused his power to coerce sexual favors from a subordinate or take other liberties			0
if women make a charge , they have to live with an assault on their own character			0
the guy down the hall needs to learn one very simple lesson : treat your female colleagues just as you would treat the guys			1
if you pat the guys on the head , and put your arm around them , or pat their butt to show you like their outfit , go ahead and do it to the " girls " in the office			0
but if not , keep your hands to yourself , and learn to treat the women you work with like colleagues , not ladies			1
if every man learns to treat women in the workforce as , well , regular people , the fear of behavior being " misinterpreted " as a sexual harasser will disappear			2
no one should make a sexual overture to a subordinate , a gay man should n't come on to his male assistant , and a heterosexual woman should n't hit on her male secretary			2
no one likes a sleazy cheat			0
but harassing women who work for you is far more than sleazy			0
it 's time for a fourth wave feminist movement to create a world where being a woman does n't mean you are treated differently at the office			2
when that world comes , we will be finally be in a post-feminist era			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : why do @entity6 adultery accusations seem to stick , but not harassment ones ?
she says men dismiss harassment because of worry about own workplace actions
she says adultery hurts the spouse ; harassment hurts every woman in a workplace
@entity199 : we will have a real post-feminist era when workers all treat colleagues the same way
