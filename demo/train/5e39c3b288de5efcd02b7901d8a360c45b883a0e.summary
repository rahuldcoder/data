-- @entity1 scored his second hat - trick in successive matches to help @entity4 thrash city neighbors @entity6 4 - 0 on tuesday and keep alive their slim hopes of winning the @entity9 title			1
the @entity11 winger scored four goals in saturday 's 6 - 2 thumping of @entity14 , and his latest treble puts him on 36 league goals for the season -- five ahead of nearest @entity19 challenger @entity18 and within sight of the record goals tally of 38 in a season jointly held by @entity22 ( @entity4 ) and @entity23 ( @entity24 )			1
@entity1 's treble sees @entity4 move to within five points of @entity28 , but @entity30 's side need just one point from their final three league games to win the title for a third successive season -- and will be crowned @entity36 champions if they draw at @entity37 on wednesday			1
@entity4 took the lead on 23 minutes when @entity40 's superb cross from the right was powerfully headed home by @entity1			2
and @entity43 international @entity40 set another up for @entity1 on 57 minutes when he cut the ball back for his teammate to stroke into an empty net			0
substitute @entity48 added a third with 20 minutes remaining and @entity1 completed his hat - trick with a late penalty			1
in other matches on tuesday , @entity51 edged closer to avoiding relegation with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity24 -- a result that lifts @entity51 out of the bottom three			0
elsewhere , @entity57 suffered a surprise 2 - 1 defeat at @entity60 , while @entity61 made it five consecutive league wins for the first time in their history with a 2 - 0 home victory over relegation rivals @entity67			2
@entity69 @entity68 scored for the fifth successive game to help @entity61 move six points clear of the relegation zone and to the brink of safety			0
meanwhile , in @entity77 , newly - crowned @entity76 champions @entity75 have failed in their bid to win the league and cup double after losing 2 - 1 at @entity81 in the second leg of their @entity84 semifinal			1
the tie was finely poised after the first leg at the @entity87 ended in a 2 - 2 draw , but this result means the @entity91 side will now face either holders @entity75 or @entity93 in the final on may 29 as they go in search of their first - ever silverware			0
the home side went ahead in the 63rd minute with a @entity99 diving header from a corner and they doubled their advantage 10 minutes later when @entity102 scored from the penalty spot after @entity104 was sent off for bringing down @entity105 in the area			0
bovo himself was then sent off for a high challenege on @entity109 and @entity75 scored a late consolation goal when @entity111 converted @entity113 's deflected pass .			0

@entity1 scores a hat - trick as @entity4 thrash @entity6 4 - 0
it takes @entity1 's tally to seven in two games after his four goals against @entity14
the result keeps @entity4 's faint hopes of winning the @entity36 title alive
@entity28 will be crowned champions if they defeat @entity37 on wednesday
@entity75 's hopes of winning @entity77 double are over after losing to @entity81 in cup semifinal
