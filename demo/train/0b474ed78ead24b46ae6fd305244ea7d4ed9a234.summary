-- the international draw of its star players , the huge sums paid for rights to broadcast live action and the loyal nature of its consumers have long made the @entity10 an attractive home for investors			0
in recent years this has included a number of @entity15 billionaires who , having made their money with sport franchises in the @entity15 , saw ownership of teams including @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , @entity22 ( @entity23 and @entity24 ) and @entity25 ( @entity26 ) as the best way to expand a global portfolio			2
@entity29 -- owner of the @entity31 basketball team , the @entity32 's @entity30 and @entity34 's @entity33 -- could be the next to join this elite group after a major shareholder at @entity38 - based @entity37 confirmed that she is looking to sell her stake			1
@entity29 already owns 29 percent of the @entity42 quarterfinalists , and needs only one more percent to trigger a complete takeover			2
blog : should @entity29 buy @entity37 ? but with the economic downturn compounding both @entity22 and @entity20 's struggles with debt and growing fan unrest -- coupled with @entity29 's recent confirmation of a takeover bid for the @entity52 -- would it be wise for the @entity15 to aim his sights on owning @entity37 now ? @entity0 's business correspondent @entity54 helps break down @entity29 's decision			1
why invest in the @entity10 ? the recent sale of their overseas television rights amounted to over $ 1.5 billion , while the domestic rights went for much more			0
this means the @entity10 clubs can sign expensive players on big wages , according to @entity54			2
" a lot of the league 's strength is to do with @entity68 and its multi-billion dollar deal to show the games around the world , " he said			0
" @entity68 gives an enormous amount of money to @entity10 clubs			0
" could @entity29 expect much profit from @entity37 ? @entity54 says the main way to maximize profit is to keep a club healthy , and deliver success on the pitch before selling it on down the line for a profit			1
he said : " i look upon @entity29 like these other guys in @entity15 : the @entity87 own a @entity89 team , the guys who own @entity22 own hockey clubs in @entity15			1
they only make money if they hold onto them for a really long time and sell them			0
" is @entity37 a financially healthy club ? yes , according to @entity54			1
he says the club had to take out a big loan to build its new stadium -- the @entity98 , which opened in 2006 -- but that is being chipped away			0
he explained : " there is a small section of seats at @entity37 's new ground that generates as much money on a match day as the entire former ground did			2
all other seats are gravy , so the amount of money they make per game is phenomenal			0
" the site of the former ground has been turned into flats , which has also generated a considerable amount of money , @entity54 said			0
@entity54 believes @entity37 manager @entity116 's model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move			1
" @entity116 's theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs have n't even noticed them			0
by the time they come good , and most of them do , he would have to pay $ 20 million to get these guys			0
" he says these players can also be sold on for huge profit , like in the case of @entity135 striker @entity134 , who came through the @entity37 youth system before being sold to @entity137 for $ 35 million			0
would @entity29 put the club in debt to buy it , as did the owners of @entity20 and @entity22 ? the @entity21 family bought @entity20 by putting the debt onto the club , and their most recent accounts show they are over $ 1 billion in debt			1
@entity54 says any similar move at @entity37 may not do the club any good			1
" @entity37 already has a debt from the building of the new stadium , so it would be hard to see how @entity29 would get a bank to agree to give them more debt , " he said			1
does @entity29 's extra investment in the @entity52 limit his spending power ? @entity54 says @entity29 's purchase of the @entity52 makes it very unlikely he would also fight to acquire @entity37 at the same time : " the fact that he has just ingested the @entity52 -- one of the worst teams in the @entity89 -- means he is going to have to spend his time and effort trying to rebuild that club			1
it 's hard to see that he would do that and try to take over @entity37 -- that would be a lot for one person to take on			2

@entity15 businessman @entity29 is largest shareholder at @entity173 *soccer* club @entity37
@entity29 has just signaled his intention to buy @entity89 side the @entity52
@entity0 's @entity54 says @entity29 's @entity52 move means he may not buy @entity37
