@entity0 , @entity1 -- in an isolated mountain valley on the southern edge of the @entity5 stands a cliff honey - combed with caves			1
this is @entity0 -- a cave monastery built in the 12th century by @entity1 kings and queens			1
in the 800 years since its construction , @entity0 has been destroyed by an earthquake and further damaged by invading armies			1
in the final days of winter , when snow coats the surrounding peaks , the caves look all but deserted			1
but @entity0 does have several permanent residents : seven @entity20 monks who have become the de-facto guardians of this ancient site			1
they live much like their ancestors did , in spartan cave dwellings on the side of the cliff			2
they draw their water from a spring deep within the mountain that is only accessible via a series of tunnels			2
the well is called " @entity34 , " after @entity35 , who completed construction of @entity0 eight centuries ago after the death of her father @entity39			1
uncorking @entity1 's wine heritage one of the monks who lives in the cliff is @entity43			1
he roams the tunnels and staircases that hug the cliff - side , dressed in flowing black robes			0
though he is only 28 , his thick beard and pony - tail make him look far older			0
" it puts joy in my heart to live here , " the priest says , as he looks out of the doorway of his incense - scented cave at the rushing river below , where he sometimes fishes for trout			2
" in the winter this is a quiet place			0
the frost sets in and the trees die			0
it is a holy place			0
" in fact , father @entity43 says aside from the monks , the only other people who live in this valley , are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river			1
speaking a mixture of @entity1 , @entity73 and @entity74 , the monk takes visitors on a small tour of the complex , pointing out the remnants of an irrigation system that once provided water to up to 30,000 residents			2
he also shows @entity0 's crown jewels : two cave chapels whose domed ceilings are hewn directly out of the rock			1
the domes are coated with ornate , icons , from the 8th century , depicting saints , @entity1 royalty , and the dog - shaped demons that await the damned on @entity93			2
in the summer , the monks endure a different kind of torment which disturbs their ascetic mountain life : tourists			1
" for the priests , it is not very good because they make a lot of noise , " father @entity43 says			0
" different kinds of tourists come here , some of them yell a lot and run around here and there			2
" @entity0 has long been a tourist destination for hardy tourists willing to brave hours of driving down pot - holed mountain roads			1
but road crews are now re-paving the road - and there are big plans to further develop this quiet corner of @entity1			0
" visitors to @entity1 are going to @entity0 and there is no infrastructure there at all , " says @entity117 , an executive with @entity118 , an @entity120 real estate development company			1
" that 's why @entity118 is going to invest up to 20 million dollars			2
and we are going to build a 4 - star hotel and villas also			0
" there are big hopes that through tourism , @entity1 can overcome the chaos and conflict of nearly two decades of @entity5 independence			0
in years gone by , this small @entity136 country was a prize destination , due to its unique combination of rich cuisine , ancient mountain - top monasteries , @entity142 coast line and full - throated polyphonic choral music			1
" during the @entity147 era , @entity1 was the number one tourist attraction for almost all the @entity5 , " said @entity144 , the prime minister of @entity1 , in an interview with @entity2			0
" we are getting back now this title for the region			0
" executives at @entity152 say they are still working out the final concept of the new @entity0 hotel project			1
" the main attraction is the caves			0
and also we 'll include [ a ] service package like hunting , rafting , camping and stuff like that , " says @entity117			0
the new hotel is expected to be constructed on a hillside directly across the river from the cave complex , on a patch of territory that was occupied by a @entity147 - era hotel until it was demolished a few years ago			2
father @entity43 has little positive to say about the old communist hotel ... or its capitalist replacement			0
" it 's a bad idea to build a big hotel right there , directly across from @entity0 , " he says			1
" if there 's going to be a bar or a night club there , then that 's also not good			0
" but , he concedes , the tourists will probably appreciate the view .			0

@entity0 is an isolated mountain valley , home to a 12th century cave monastery
in 800 years it 's been destroyed by an earthquake and damaged by invading armies
it looks deserted , but the caves have some dedicated residents : seven @entity20 monks
tourists boost the local *economy* , but they are also disturbing the monks ' way of life
