@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity2 speaker @entity4 's office announced thursday they reached agreement for president @entity6 to address a joint session of @entity8 on september 8 , resolving a dispute that temporarily overshadowed the focus of the planned speech -- job creation and economic growth			1
in simultaneous statements , @entity4 's spokesman said @entity6 had been invited to give his speech at 7 p.m. et next thursday and the @entity2 said the invitation was accepted			1
the agreement concluded an unusual spat over the usually non-controversial act of scheduling a presidential speech to @entity8			1
the situation left @entity6 and the @entity2 struggling to focus attention on the jobs package he will present rather than a backroom showdown that some labeled as childish and nonsense			2
on wednesday night , the @entity2 agreed to move @entity6 's address back one day -- from september 7 to september 8 -- after @entity29 complaints and follow - up consultations with @entity4			1
the story generated front - page media coverage thursday that highlighted the dispute and generated harsh criticism of how the situation was handled			1
" this really is just a new indicator , really a new low , about how dysfunctional the atmosphere in @entity0 , is , " @entity1 political contributor @entity36 said			0
@entity29 presidential candidate @entity40 said on @entity41 's " today " show that the scheduling spat was " nonsense " and showed what people " hate about politics			0
" @entity2 press secretary @entity48 downplayed the dispute to reporters , saying the @entity54 people " do not give a lick about what day next week the president speaks before @entity8			1
" @entity6 decided this week that he wanted to deliver his speech on job creation to a joint session of @entity8 , and september 7 was the first day that both the @entity2 and @entity58 would be in session after their summer recess , @entity48 said			1
" wednesday was the soonest possible day upon their return from recess , " @entity48 said of the date sought by @entity6			1
of moving the speech back a day , @entity48 said : " thursday is fine			2
" asked about what @entity6 will say in the speech , @entity48 refused to provide specifics , but said that " if members of @entity8 come back focused on the need to grow the economy and increase hiring , they will believe this is a good proposal			1
" a @entity2 statement wednesday night attempted to sum up the episode as a professional misunderstanding			0
" today , the president asked to address the @entity8 about the need for urgent action on the economic situation facing the @entity54 people as soon as @entity8 returned from recess , " the statement said			2
" both houses will be back in session after their august recess on wednesday , september 7th , so that was the date that was requested			0
we consulted with the speaker about that date before the letter was released , but he determined thursday would work better			0
" if only it had been that smooth			0
what actually happened was a day of back - and - forth accusations that dominated the news cycle and portrayed @entity0 as unable to work out relatively straightforward scheduling agreements , let alone major policy and legislative packages on job creation and deficit reduction			0
aides from both parties , almost all of them speaking on condition of not being identified , tried to portray the other side as the culprit			0
republicans said @entity4 's office was never consulted before the @entity2 announced around noon wednesday it was requesting the joint session at 8 p.m. on september 7			1
that timing conflicts with a @entity29 presidential debate at the @entity111 in @entity112			0
in a letter to @entity6 later in the day , @entity4 complained the @entity2 's request would leave insufficient time for a security sweep of the premise following the first @entity2 legislative session after its return from the summer recess			1
in response , a senior @entity2 official said chief of staff @entity123 spoke with @entity4 an hour in advance of going public with the request , and that no objections were raised			2
a @entity4 aide said thursday that during that phone conversation , @entity123 told @entity4 the specific date and time in the letter but never specifically asked for @entity4 to either approve or disapprove at that moment			2
in moving the speech to september 8 , the @entity2 faced the possibility of conflicting with the opening game of the @entity137 schedule -- an event particularly anticipated this year because of the labor dispute that once threatened to cancel the season			1
however , @entity48 said @entity6 would finish before the football game began			1
another source , a senior @entity2 official , said the decision to change the date , rather than challenge the @entity29 opposition to september 7 , was based on a desire to focus the debate on job creation instead of a scheduling fight			1
the @entity2 statement wednesday night tried to emphasize what @entity6 will say in the speech			2
" the president is focused on the urgent need to create jobs and grow our economy , so he welcomes the opportunity to address a joint session of @entity8 on thursday , september 8th and challenge our nation 's leaders to start focusing 100 % of their attention on doing whatever they can to help the @entity54 people , " it said			1
on thursday , the @entity166 in @entity0 announced @entity4 will address the group on september 15 , a week after the president 's speech			1
a @entity4 spokesman said the topic will be jobs and the economy			2
initially , the dispute over the timing of @entity6 's speech focused on logistics			1
events like the president 's @entity183 typically involve as much as four to six weeks of lead time and consultation , with a series of meetings among police , @entity180 officials and others , a @entity29 aide noted , and @entity4 's letter to @entity6 complained the president 's proposed timing would make it impossible to complete proper security steps in @entity8			1
the conflict then shifted to consultation , specifically who did or did n't properly notify the other side			0
a @entity2 official said @entity4 's office was consulted and raised no objection			2
that prompted @entity4 spokesman @entity203 to insist that " no one in the speaker 's office -- not the speaker , not any staff -- signed off on the date the @entity2 announced today			2
" " unfortunately , we were n't even asked if that date worked for the @entity2 , " @entity203 said			0
" shortly before it arrived this morning , we were simply informed that a letter was coming			0
it 's unfortunate the @entity2 ignored decades -- if not centuries -- of the protocol of working out a mutually agreeable date and time before making any public announcement			0
" a senior @entity219 aide familiar with scheduling such events in previous administrations said " the childish behavior coming out of the speaker 's office today is truly historic			0
" " it is unprecedented to reject the date that a president wants to address a joint session of the @entity8 , " the senior @entity219 aide said			0
" people die and state funerals are held with less fuss , so the logistics excuse by the speaker 's office is laughable			0
yes , consultation always occurs , but the president always gets the date he wants			0
" meanwhile , an aide to @entity2 minority leader @entity237 said @entity4 did n't consult with @entity2 @entity219 leaders about seeking a new date for @entity6 's speech			1
@entity6 's request for a september 7 speech was accepted by the leadership of the @entity219 - controlled @entity58 , according to a @entity219 @entity58 leadership aide			1
however , approval of leaders from both chambers of @entity8 is required for such a presidential request to be accepted			2
the address to @entity8 is intended to provide a prime - time platform for the rollout of his highly anticipated job growth plan			0
" our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges , and millions of hard - working @entity54 continue to look for jobs , " @entity6 said in a letter sent earlier wednesday to @entity4 and @entity58 majority leader @entity255 , @entity256			1
" as i have traveled across our country this summer and spoken with our fellow @entity54 , i have heard a consistent message : @entity0 needs to put aside politics and start making decisions based on what is best for our country and not what is best for each of our parties in order to grow the economy and create jobs			0
we must answer this call			0
" the national unemployment rate currently stands at 9.1 % -- a figure all but ensuring that the state of the fragile economy will remain the dominant issue of the 2012 presidential campaign			0
@entity1 's @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
