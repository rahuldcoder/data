" it 's been a long road , " said @entity12 , who was married to @entity6 for 10 years			1
that road ended monday when a federal judge ruled against the friend 's widow , who claimed it was a gift , not a loan , attorney @entity21 said			1
collector @entity22 , who is an @entity6 family friend , said the gold and diamond ring is the " holy grail " of boxing memorabilia			1

@entity31 , who is a clinical psychologist at @entity33 in @entity0 , loaned it to dr. @entity35 in summer 2004 after she learned he was suffering from cancer			2
@entity35 had treated her husband , who had died from leukemia earlier that year , she said			0
" he had always been so supportive of us			0
" " it was a natural thing , " she said , because @entity35 was a fan of her former husband			0

when @entity35 died in november 2004 , he still had the ring , she said			0
" i did n't want to ask his widow immediately , so i waited a month or so and then i could n't find her , " @entity31 said			0
" she had left town			0
" after six years of trying to find the ring , a private investigator located @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , and began a legal battle that ended this week , @entity21 said			0
when @entity31 filed a lawsuit against the widow seeking the ring , @entity35 counter-sued claiming it was given to her husband by @entity6 as a gift			1
" the ring was my husband 's to keep and an assurance of the personal bond between them , my husband and @entity6 , " @entity35 said in her suit			1
while the doctor had treated the boxer once or twice , they were not close friends , @entity31 said			0
@entity6 signed a sworn statement to help his former wife 's legal battle for the return of the ring , @entity21 said			1
it was handed over to @entity31 in a @entity0 courtroom on monday after @entity80 district judge @entity79 threw out the widow 's counterclaim , he said			1
the ring will eventually go to @entity85 , the 32 - year - old daughter of @entity31 from her marriage with @entity6 , she said			2
