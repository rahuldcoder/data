-- @entity2 actress @entity1 has become a new critics ' darling after her breakout role in last year 's hit movie " 12 years a slave			1
" since then , the award ceremonies and opportunities to dazzle photographers have been plentiful for @entity11 , whose mesmerizing performance as @entity14 earned her numerous accolades and recognition , including an @entity18 nomination for @entity19 in a @entity20			1
though all this attention is new to @entity1 , who was born in @entity23 to @entity2 parents , the young actress seems to enjoy all the hype around her			1
but there is much more to her story than how she captivates the cameras on the red carpet			0
@entity0 's @entity30 caught up with @entity1 to speak about her journey from @entity2 to @entity32			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : how did you end up being born in @entity23 ? @entity1 : my father is a politician			1
at the time he was also a professor of political science and he was organizing for democracy in @entity2			0
we were under an autocratic regime and after a series of unfortunate events , including the disappearance of his brother , he went into political exile in @entity23			0
i was born in his last year there			1

ln : yes , all my conscious memories are in @entity2 until when i was 16 my parents sent me back to @entity23 to learn @entity53			0
i grew up in @entity54 , which is the capital of @entity2 , so it 's hustle and bustle and there 's always something going on			1
i come from a very big family and we 're very close knit so i had lots of time with me family			0
my parents raised all of us to just pursue our hearts ' desires			0
they were like " figure out what your purpose is on this world and then do it and do it to excellence ; no matter what it is , whether it 's being a janitor or a doctor , as long as you 're filling your life 's purpose then we 're good			1
" no pressure to pursue one thing or another , although i will say my father was very upset when i dropped physics though			0
review : ' @entity86 ' agonizingly magnificent @entity0 : not too long after you arrived to @entity23 you decided to go to school in the @entity89			1
one of the things i read about was your discovery of race in @entity89 and how it 's treated			1
ln : i grew up in a world where the majority of people were black so that was n't the defining quality of anyone			0
when you 're describing someone , you do n't start out with " he 's black , he 's white			1
" no , i was a girl , i was my ethnic group @entity102 , i was middle class , i was many things before i was black , so it was like a rearrangement when i came here and realized that in @entity89 that 's the first thing that people notice about me			2
you do n't hear that word , " black , black " very often in @entity2 to tell you the truth , so that was definitely jarring			0
@entity0 : " 12 years a slave " is your first feature film			2
where do you go inside yourself to play a role like that of @entity14 with such generosity of spirit ? ln : i do n't believe that we are really as individual as we think we are and that 's what makes the profession of acting possible -- that we can empathize with things that are more than our personal , limited experience			2
and i think that you do work and like @entity126 [ @entity127 ] said to me , " you let @entity128 walk in the door			0
" i think it 's less about going into myself than opening myself ; just opening myself to the research , the script , the autobiography , the other things that i read , the other things i saw and just trying to immerse myself in a world that i personally do n't know -- but i know that my spirit does -- and can know if i allow myself to open up to it			2
there is something about acting that 's mysterious and magical because there is only so much i can do to prepare and then i have to just let go and breathe and believe that it will come through			2
because i think if i had been required to play @entity14 in any sort of methodical way where i go in and i never go out until we wrap the picture , i do n't think i would have survived emotionally because it 's heavy			2
but having those moments of lightness and separation from the work we were doing on set was very important , even to fortifying our trust for each other while we were doing the work			0

it 's not easy subject matter			2
it 's heavy but it 's beautiful and you hope that people would at least open their eyes to see it -- and then they did			2
so my first feeling was relief that it had been so well received and then they just kept receiving it and celebrating it and the conversation has been developing and shifting ; it 's been so exciting and for me to be part of that celebration and my work to be lauded in all these ways has been amazing			0
and i 've felt relief as well that people are registering @entity14 's loftiness -- in praising me i feel like her spirit is being uplifted , really , because what i met in those pages of @entity190 's book was heartbreaking -- and it still breaks my heart -- and inspiring , and i had the privilege of bringing her back to life			0
i 'm just happy and filled with gratitude to have had the experience in the first place and for it to be so well received			1
