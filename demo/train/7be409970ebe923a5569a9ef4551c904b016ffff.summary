@entity0 -- while the fight for equality between women and men has long been an uphill struggle , the current economic situation -- the " age of austerity " -- poses a new kind of threat			1
in recent years , the steady , albeit slow , march towards equality has not only come to a standstill but threatens to change direction			0
here in the @entity16 , record cuts to public spending risk actually reversing progress			2
the @entity19 's analysis has found that women face a " triple jeopardy " of job losses , benefit cuts and the expectation that they will fill a looming " care gap			2
" women 's unemployment is now at a 25 - year high , and rising			2
in large part , this is down to dramatic cuts to the public sector workforce -- women make up two - thirds of this workforce overall			0
women are also bearing the brunt of cuts to benefits			0
the " emergency budget " of 2010 contained some $ 13 billion ( Â £ 8 billion ) worth of cuts			0
more than 72 % of this cash will come from women 's pockets , because many of the cuts are to benefits that more women than men rely on			0
finally , women lose out more than men as public services are rolled back -- both because they tend to rely on these services more , but also because they end up " plugging the gap " as support services such as low - cost childcare dry up			0

the impact of these cuts on women is high on the political agenda			0
@entity0 's mayoral election has grabbed most of the limelight in the @entity16 media : a steady stream of commentators have speculated on what different results will mean for different political parties , while the campaign itself has been dominated by the outsized personalities of the core contenders			1
but in the midst of the bluster , mudslinging and occasional genuine political debate , scant attention has been paid to the sizeable and substantial influence the mayor 's office wields			0
whoever wins this election will be the most powerful directly elected politician in the @entity16 ( and , in fact , most of @entity95 ) , with overarching responsibility for a budget of some $ 23.6 billion ( Â £ 14.6 billion )			1
how this money is spent can make a real difference to the lives of @entity0 's four million women			1
@entity103 's research has found that , far from leading the way , the @entity16 's capital city lags behind much of the country when it comes to gender equality			1
women in @entity0 are more likely to live in poverty , experience a wider pay gap , and are less likely to work once they have children than women living elsewhere			1
in fact , @entity0 has the lowest level of maternal employment in the country : just over half of the city 's mothers with dependent children work , compared to almost two - thirds across the @entity16			1
more from leading women : @entity125 's female execs quota women are also thin on the ground when it comes to positions of power in public and political life			0
only 29 of @entity0 's 73 members of @entity133 are female ; just eight of the 25 members of the @entity136 -- which holds the mayor to account -- are women			1
our research also suggests women in @entity0 are more likely to experience sexual assault than those living elsewhere in the @entity16			1
far from getting better , the gap between women and men in @entity0 is set to widen			2
the toxic combination of rising women 's unemployment , cuts to welfare and the ever - increasing cost of living in the capital means that life for @entity0 's women is going to get tougher			1
some groups will be particularly hard hit			0
more lone parents call @entity0 home than anywhere else in the @entity16 , and because of changes to the welfare system , they can expect to lose a month 's worth of income on average by 2015			1
this is why @entity103 has called on mayoral candidates to commit to taking action on gender equality			0
we asked all candidates to pledge that , if elected , they will assess the impact of their policies -- including the @entity171 budget -- on women and men			0
thus far , the @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 candidates have all committed to taking this vital first step , a surefire way of improving the way policy decisions are made -- and the lot of women in @entity0			2
you can read more about the different candidates ' policies and how they will affect women here			0
the political color of @entity187 might mean a lot to the different political parties , but it makes a daily , real difference to the lives of millions of @entity192 .			2

expert : whoever wins control of @entity0 's $ 23 *bn* budget could make a real difference to the city 's four million women
@entity202 : women in @entity0 are more likely to live in poverty , experience a wider pay gap than women elsewhere in @entity16
only eight of the 25 members of the current @entity136 , which holds mayor to account , are women
