-- there is an opening scene in @entity4 blockbuster " @entity5 " when an alien - like submarine plunges to the darkest depths of the ocean			1
" seeing her coming out of the water like a ghost ship -- still gets me every time , " murmurs treasure hunter @entity9 , gazing in awe at the sunken ship from his luminous capsule			0
more than 15 years after director @entity18 made his @entity20 - winning film , it was his turn to scour the deep sea in a high - tech pod			1
but unlike his " @entity5 " fictional character @entity9 , @entity18 was n't in search of a sunken diamond -- instead he was gathering scientific data which could revolutionize our understanding of both deep sea creatures and earthquakes			1
last year , the 57 - year - old @entity32 director of box office hits " avatar " and " terminator " series , became the first person to reach the deepest point of the ocean solo			1
@entity18 's remarkable journey 11 - kilometers below the water in a seven - meter long sub , was part of a @entity45 fact - finding mission more than a year in the making			2
predicting earthquakes in a special interview with @entity0 , the filmmaker revealed the expedition could one day help scientists predict deep sea earthquakes -- and their devastating tsunamis			1
" building technology vehicles like the @entity55 to get down there , is a first step to planting large instruments which could allow us to survey seismic activity , " explained @entity18			0
" ultimately it could lead to some predictive modeling which tells us ' look we 've got pressure building up here , maybe this could be a tsunami in the @entity67 , get ready , brace yourselves			0
" dig deep @entity18 admitted we 're still some way off predicting earthquakes , but until now we did n't have the technology to fully explore such depths as the @entity73 -- the deepest point in the ocean			1
the great chasm , located off the coast of @entity78 in the @entity79 , is more than a mile deeper than @entity80 is tall , and a whopping 120 times larger than the @entity81			0
@entity18 is just the third person to reach the @entity73 , since oceanographers @entity82 and @entity84 in 1960 , and the only person to do so solo			1
he spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor -- far longer than the 20 minutes @entity88 and @entity84 did in their huge blimp - like submersible 53 years ago			2
" before now , there was so little access to these deep trenches which , if you add them all together , constitute an area the size of @entity99 , " said @entity18			2
" we simply did n't have vehicles that could function at that depth because of the extreme pressure , so the @entity55 represents a new generation of vehicles that will open up that frontier			0
" alien life but the ground - breaking expedition was n't just a leap into the unknown -- the team also discovered dozens of species of marine life , some with mysterious cases of gigantism			1
" we found 68 new species -- including around 60 new bacterial species never seen by science before , " said @entity18			2
" we also found examples of gigantism , which is as yet unexplained			0
now do n't imagine something 30 feet long , but if you have an animal that 's normally a centimeter long suddenly appearing 10 or 20 times its normal size , how do you explain that ? " small sub , big dreams cocooned in his lime green sub , in a world so deep under water that the sunlight does n't penetrate and the pressure can be a thousand times that on land , @entity18 admitted feeling " like a walnut in his shell			2
" the 12 - ton pod , designed by @entity18 and his team of engineers , was made from a super-strong glass foam material able to withstand the immense pressure which shrunk it by three inches			0
unlike @entity88 and @entity84 's 18 - meter sub , which five decades ago was not equipped to take photos , today 's cutting - edge @entity55 was armed with multiple cameras and a mechanical arm for scooping up rock and animal samples			0
future generations back on dry land , the @entity55 will now tour schools across the @entity156 as it winds its way to its final home at the @entity159 in @entity160			0
" it 's turned into this cross-country adventure for the sub and i believe that we 'll be able to inspire young minds to want to pursue a career in engineering , maths , science , and exploration , " said @entity18			0
the @entity32 , who has made 72 deep sea dives , including 33 to the actual sunken " @entity5 , " added that the government should be investing more in ocean research			1
" there 's always been a huge imbalance in the funds going into space exploration , and i do n't begrudge that because i like exploration , but we definitely are underfunded in ocean science right now , " he said			0
fearless filmmaker @entity18 's next challenge however will not be on the ocean floor , but creating the second and third installments of his 2009 film " @entity187 " -- the highest grossing movie of all time			1
much like plummeting to the darkest depths of the sea , filmmaking presents its own pressure			0
as the three - time @entity20 winner said : " i 'd much rather deal with the physical threats of deep sea ocean diving or the potential failures of engineering , than i would the fickleness of an audience			1

" @entity5 " director @entity18 only person to reach deepest point of ocean solo
