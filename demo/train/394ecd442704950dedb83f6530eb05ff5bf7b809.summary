@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 22 - year - old woman in @entity1 , pregnant and suffering from illnesses , has become a flashpoint in the country 's debate on abortion			1
the life of the woman , known only as " @entity12 , " is in danger if the pregnancy goes full term , but abortion is illegal in @entity1 with no exceptions , women 's rights groups say			1
anti-abortion groups counter that @entity12 is being used by abortion - rights advocates as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws			1
@entity12 's case is not the first time that risk to a mother 's life has created an abortion controversy in @entity28 and the @entity29			1
last year , a young woman in the @entity31 was denied chemotherapy to treat her leukemia for weeks because of the risk it posed to her unborn child			0
she eventually began receiving treatment , but both she and her fetus died			0
in @entity12 's case , she is suffering from lupus and kidney problems , and her unborn child developed without parts of its brain or skull			1
she asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life , but doctors are hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they wo n't be prosecuted			2
the country 's @entity51 has taken up the case , but it has deliberated for weeks without a ruling , raising the ire of the groups that support @entity12			1
" we are outraged at their abdication of their role to protect and defend @entity12 's life and health , " said @entity57 , @entity58 researcher for @entity59			1
" there is no justice in this delay , and definitely no humanity			0
" @entity12 is now 24 weeks pregnant			1
although she is at the center of a national debate over abortion , @entity12 has declined to give interviews			2
her mother , however , has spoken to the press			0
" if this baby is born both ( mother and child ) could die , and they tell me that the baby would survive just six hours if it is born , " the mother said			0
@entity12 argues that an abortion could save her life , and allow her to care for her other child , who is a year old			1
" the fetus will die because it is not healthy , and so we have to decide that we must save @entity12 's life because there is another child who needs her , " said @entity86 of the @entity87			1
opponents of abortion have not been silent on the issue			0
" i think that a great debate has been created using @entity12 , using her problem to promote the legalization of abortion , " said @entity96 of the country 's @entity97			2
although the doctors who are treating @entity12 recommended an abortion , others in the medical field disagree			2
" unfortunately , lupus is an incurable disease , and there is no reason to lie to the public , " said @entity107 of the @entity108			0
" @entity12 will not get better if her pregnancy is terminated			0
the pregnancy is a temporary condition but the lupus will remain			0
" the country 's health minister has indicated that the government supports an abortion , but that it is up to the @entity51 to decide			2
with each passing week , the debate is more intense as the health of the mother and fetus are weighed			0
if the @entity51 does not act quickly , @entity12 may travel to another country where she can get an abortion , her mother said			1
" if here in this country they do n't allow her what she has asked for , that would be a possibility , " she said			0
@entity138 's government puts forward draft abortion bill in @entity141 : @entity143 horror fuels fight for abortion laws			0
