-- recent revelations in print and now on television by convicted match fixer @entity4 are once again throwing the spotlight onto match - fixing in football			1
coercing players , officials and administrators into rigging matches has netted fixers millions of dollars while football is left counting the cost to its integrity			1
how big is the problem ? it 's widespread , says @entity19 , who has worked as an investigator for football 's world governing body , @entity23			1
" i never thought it would be across the globe but it is , and that 's the most surprising thing to me ( along with ) the consummate ease with which fixers gained access to football , " @entity19 told @entity0			2
in february last year , the @entity32 's law enforcement agency , @entity30 announced that 680 matches ( 380 of them in @entity34 ) played between 2008 and 2011 were under suspicion of being rigged			2
" this is the work of a suspected organized crime syndicate based in @entity39 and operated with criminal networks around @entity34 , " @entity35 , director of @entity30 said following an 18 - month probe			0
specific matches under scrutiny were not named by @entity30 , but fixtures include @entity46 qualifiers and @entity48 ties , they said			0
@entity34 's top domestic leagues have been no stranger to football corruption in recent times with notable match - fixing scandals erupting in @entity55 's @entity54 in 2005 and @entity57 's @entity56 and b the following season			1
but match fixing extends far beyond @entity34 's borders with scandals uncovered in @entity39 , @entity62 and @entity63 in recent years			1
investigators say that much of the problem stems from illegal gambling markets in @entity39 , which are said to turn over billions of dollars every single day			1
" football is by far the largest betting market in the world and by far the most liquid , " says @entity67 , a sports betting consultant			1
fixers like to target football because there are a lot of matches played , he says			0
but there are other reasons			0
" a lot of players are not very well paid and , particularly in the @entity62 leagues , they do n't get paid ... so match - fixing becomes more attractive , " @entity67 says			1
how do you go about fixing football matches ? with alarming ease , if you believe @entity4			1
" i 've fixed matches with just a single player , " he says			1
" but , of course , you would like to have the goalkeeper , we would like to have the defenders , then the striker ... " @entity4 told @entity0 that a fix will often start with one player who is offered money to throw a game			1
if they are happy to play ball , the match fixer will then use the target to sound out other members of the team			1
using a group of players to fix a match is advantageous to the fixer because it improves the chances of getting the desired result			1
it 's also more difficult to spot says @entity112 , author of " @entity114 's guide to @entity115			1
" " you have six players running around trying as hard as they can ; and you have five players pretending to run around trying as hard as they can , " @entity112 explained in a piece penned for @entity0 last year			1
" this way , the outsider finds it extraordinarily difficult to figure out what is going on			0
all they see is 11 players who may or may not be making mistakes			0
" referees are also prime targets for match fixers and @entity4 would frequently attempt to bribe the man in black			1
some referees were ripe for corruption , he claims			0
" these are people who are supposed to uphold the laws of the game			0
but sad to say that , you know , @entity23 does n't really pay these referees that well , " @entity4 said			1
" they get about $ 1,000 or maybe $ 1,500 ( per game ) which is very small money			0
in my opinion , @entity23 should pay them a lot more or they should start to professionalize this officiating			1
" when asked about the payment of referees , @entity23 told @entity0 : " corruption does not depend on how much you are paid , but instead , and above all , honesty and values of the individual			1
" there is also evidence that some club owners are corrupting results			0
" @entity30 investigators spoke about this during their conference ( in 2013 ) , " @entity112 says			2
" there are dodgy club owners in @entity34 who will begin a season by looking at the 40 or so games in the league , and think , ' right , we will try to win these 30 matches , and we will lose these 10 , ' " @entity112 said			2
" knowing that they will lose those specific 10 matches , the club owners will bet against their team and make more money losing those matches , than in winning all the other games			0
" what are football 's authorities doing ? a lot or not enough , depending on who you talk to			0
@entity23 points to the " vast range of measures and initiatives , " they have implemented in response to match fixing			1
these include national and regional workshops and an @entity181 developed in partnership with @entity183			0
" the integrity of the game is a top priority , " @entity23 told @entity0			2
" we take any allegations of match manipulation very seriously			0
" but @entity67 is n't convinced the footballing authorities are doing enough yet			0
" ( they are ) slightly better than what they used to be , but they used to be absolutely dreadful , " @entity67 says			0
" in fact , they just had their heads in the sand about it			0
i remember going to some meetings with leagues 15 years ago and me saying : ' we could do a match - monitoring service , ' and they said : ' why would we want that ? ' they 've got a bit more alerted , but they are a long way from where they could be			0
" education is also crucial , he thinks			0
" the clubs and the league need to have an education program to tell the young players if you are approached by a match - fixer you need to come and tell us , " he said			1
" that needs to be an education process from a very early stage , from 13 or 14 ( years old ) for players coming from the professional rank or joining clubs			2
" improvements have been made at @entity34 , he says , pointing to their use of betting monitoring -- @entity230 football 's governing body annually track more than 30,000 matches across the continent for betting irregularities			2
@entity23 have their own monitoring system called " @entity235 , " but @entity67 questions the organization 's capability to deal with corruption			2
" i think it 's difficult for some people to take them seriously when their own house does n't appear to be in order , " he says , noting the continuing controversy surrounding the bidding process for @entity46 finals			0
but @entity19 , who worked for @entity23 from 2010 to 2012 , defends his former employer			2
" @entity23 were really concerned , " he says			2
" for the two years i was there working under @entity249 , he was genuinely concerned and tasked us solely to match - fixing			2
once you 're inside it as a football fan and you 're seeing ( match - fixing ) first hand , you ca n't help but be concerned for the game			1
" will football ever be fix free ? experts are n't sure			0
" fixing and corruption has always been in sport , it 's really part of human nature , " says @entity112			1
" the trick now is battling this globalized phenomenon of corruption			0
frankly , what we need is an independent , international anti-corruption agency for sport , the same way @entity266 ( @entity266 ) has been set up			1
" i 'd like to think that we could make the majority of the game safe and i feel the only way that can be done is by an independent body being formed -- an international independent body with proper powers , " @entity19 says			0
" i think individual associations standing alone will always be vulnerable to clever criminals with money and the human condition makes people naturally vulnerable when lots of money is involved			0
