-- she spent her teenage years ruling the tennis world , and now @entity3 is hoping her world of tennis can rule today 's teenagers			1
from becoming the youngest grand slam champion to having her career shattered by a traumatic stabbing attack , then battling related weight problems before losing her father and coach to cancer , the 39 - year - old has plenty of life experience to draw on for her latest project			1
" i am old enough now to know that life throws different curveballs and it 's about how you handle them , " she told @entity0 's @entity18			2
" i try to handle them as best i can			0
" long retired from the top level , the former world no. 1 has followed up her autobiography by co-authoring a fictional book on life at a tennis academy			1
the main character of " @entity31 : @entity39 " gained her entry to an elite tennis school by virtue of a scholarship , just as the eventual winner of nine grand slams did herself as a 12 - year - old			1
five years of training at @entity42 's famous academy in @entity43 turned the slender young @entity3 into the 1990 @entity45 champion at the tender age of 16 years and six months , and at 17 she became the youngest no. 1			1
those records have since been broken by @entity49 but the fact remains that @entity3 -- who then represented @entity51 but who has since taken @entity54 citizenship -- was a prodigy whose equal the world had never seen before			1
still the youngest winner at @entity45 , she added the @entity58 and @entity59 titles to her cv in 1991 -- and is now in no doubt as to what drove her to the top			0
" i had an absolutely great time co-writing the book ( with @entity67 ) , " @entity3 said			1
" the main character , @entity68 , had a way to get into the academies , which is the same way i did -- on a scholarship			0
and as i always said in the book , there are two ways to get into an academy -- money or talent -- but at the end of the day talent always wins			2
" there can be no doubt that her ability , coupled with a fierce mental dedication , propelled @entity3 to the very top but her career was tragically derailed in circumstances that were unimaginable until they actually happened			1
a little over 20 years ago -- on april 30 , 1993 -- @entity3 was playing a routine match in @entity90 when a deranged fan leaped over the advertising hoardings and plunged a knife into her back as she sat on her chair during a changeover			2
it soon emerged that the @entity99 assailant , one @entity98 , was a devoted fan of former world no. 1 @entity100 who carried out the attack in a bid to return his compatriot to the top of the rankings -- which did come to pass , but clearly for the very worst of reasons			2
the knife sunk one and a half inches into @entity3 ' upper left back , and though the wounds took a few months to heal the psychological impact left far deeper scars -- as the former teenage prodigy readily admits			1
it would be over two years before @entity3 returned to the tour but with her father @entity117 , who was also her coach , suffering from a cancer that would eventually take his life in 1998 , the youngster 's weight ballooned as she sought solace for her troubles in binge eating			1
she was never the same player again -- and her 2009 autobiography " @entity124 " gives a fascinating into the knock - on effects of @entity127 's attack			1
" according to a psychiatric evaluation ... he stated that i was not ' pretty			0
women should n't be as thin as a bone , ' " she wrote after her retirement , which came five years after her last official tour match			0
" i wonder now just how much his words haunted my recovery			0
an integral part of my rehab revolved around cardio sessions			0
but i started finding excuses for avoiding the treadmill			0
" darkness had descended into my head			0
no matter how many ways i analyzed my situation , i could n't find a bright side			0
" @entity147 became the only way to silence my demons			0
i 'd walk into the kitchen , grab a bag of crisps and a bowl of chocolate ice cream , then head to the couch and eat in front of the television			0
" i still do n't know why my anguish found solace in food			0
maybe i was subconsciously reacting to @entity98 's angry comment that ' women should n't be as thin as a bone			2
' if i padded myself with extra weight , i 'd be protected from being hurt again			0
" returning to the sport in august 1995 , @entity3 would go on to win another grand slam -- the @entity167 in 1996 -- but even that glory was tainted			1
having gone from a size eight to 18 , her ballooning weight prompted such self - consciousness that she wanted to be out of the limelight as soon as possible , spending the awards ceremony in @entity176 " thinking about getting off the court and hiding in my tracksuit			2
" it was to be @entity3 ' last major title and the eating disorder sparked by @entity98 's savage attack continued to plague her until she played her last competitive match in 2003 , as the girl who once had the world at her fingertips slipped into the shadows			1
" to be thrown into the limelight at the age of 16 , being no. 1 in the world and yet struggling to be a teenager is not an easy thing , " she told @entity0			0
" then at 19 , to get stabbed and have my career stopped for two and a half years , decide to come back and then lose my coach / best friend / dad , i 've had a lot of lows and highs -- but at the end of the day that is what life is about			2
" and it 's just really about living in the present			0
" which is what @entity3 has been doing , having appeared in the popular " @entity208 " tv program in 2008 and now hoping to continue her career as a novelist with sequels planned to follow the publication of " @entity31 : @entity213			1
" fittingly , given the subject matter of her book , her writing began on the tennis circuit as she sought an escape from the monotony of endless traveling to tournaments			1
" on the downtime during rain delays and traveling , i wrote a lot , " she said			0
" in tennis , everything is about hitting that yellow ball and being really focused on it -- but writing ' game on ' was just so much fun as i got to use my imagination			2
" to finally see it come alive has been a great joy for me			1

@entity3 is moving on to a new stage of her life after co-authoring a fiction novel
the former tennis star says the writing *process* " has been a great joy "
book is set in a tennis academy , *mirroring* the 39 - year - old 's early days in the sport
