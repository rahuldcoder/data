-- the film industry was devastated by two recent deaths that have led to a movement to alter this sunday 's " in memoriam " segment of the @entity6 telecast : one was the natural causes passing of comedy filmmaker @entity9 , 69 , and the other was the accidental death of camera assistant @entity12 , 27 , who was struck by a train in @entity14 while working on a biopic of rock musician @entity16			1
@entity9 , the star of " ghostbusters " and " stripes , " and director of " vacation , " " @entity21 " and " @entity22 , " died on monday at his home in @entity24 , while @entity25 , whose credits include " @entity12 " ( the film that led to her death ) and the tv series " @entity31 , " was killed last thursday while filming on a bridge that authorities said was supposed to be off - limits to the production			0
due to the questions surrounding her death , her name has become a rallying cry for behind - the - scenes workers calling for more scrutiny of on - set safety , and it has also led to a movement			0
many are signing petitions and making telephone calls asking the producers of the @entity6 to include her in the telecast 's tribute			1
but ... that effort misunderstands how that part of the show is created			0
film crew worker 's tragic death prompts @entity57 movement under most circumstances , a film worker in @entity25 ' position would not be included in the telecast 's tribute			2
that 's not meant as a dismissal of her , or her job , but there are many thousands of people employed by the entertainment industry , and — for better or worse — the @entity6 tend to focus only on the deaths of those who are familiar to the public at large			1
if not , you could expect the " in memoriam " segment to take up the entire 3 - and - a - half - hour running time of the telecast			1
but yes , there certainly have been times when exceptions were made			0
at the 83rd annual ceremony , publicist @entity79 was included after being gunned down while driving home from a movie premiere , even though her name was only well - known within the film industry			0
there 's no question the @entity87 could make a change if it wanted — particularly if it was a matter of sending a message about on - set safety			1
but the decision is not up to the producers — this year , @entity94 and @entity95 — so efforts to flood their offices with letters , emails , phone calls , and a bombardment of tweets is simply taking the argument to the wrong people			1
( the producers themselves did not immediately return a call for comment			2
) while they control much of the content of the telecast , there are two elements of the @entity6 over which they have no say : the " in memoriam " reel and tickets to the show			1
this is partly designed to protect whomever is producing the show — a way of preventing them from getting deluged by requests for either			0
oscars 2014 : a vegas oddsmaker ranks the races so who decides ? that would be a committee made up from the @entity87 , who sift through a list of about 300 submissions and decide yea or nay on who makes the cut , depending on their contribution to filmmaking			1
roughly 40 end up being included in the film , which is created weeks in advance of the @entity6			1
the producers are given the list , and then commission the film			2
and almost every year , the names of those left out tend to cause an uproar			0
the film can be re-edited at the last minute , and that is very likely going to be the case with @entity9 — a decades - long presence in the tv and film business , responsible for some of the most memorable and thoughtful comedies of the past 30 years			0
but if he does make the cut , it is those achievements that are being commemorated , not just his demise			0
and his last - minute addition will come at the behest of the @entity87 , not the producers			1
in the case of @entity12 , it 's very possible that all the film crews who are galvanized to action by her death could make a compelling case for her inclusion in the broadcast			2
but that case has to be made to the @entity87 , and not the producers , who can do nothing but refer such requests to @entity87			1
( all while trying to put a show on this sunday			0
) those who hope the @entity6 will take a stand on this issue should be sure to make their request in the right direction			2
it may be too late for this year , but those who believe in this cause could also benefit from making sure it 's remembered a year from now			2

two deaths are being petitioned for inclusion in this year 's @entity6 " in memoriam "
the process of listing actors in this segment takes place weeks in advance
a list of roughly 300 submissions often gets *whittled* down to around 40
the producers do *n't* get to decide , but rather an @entity87 committee
