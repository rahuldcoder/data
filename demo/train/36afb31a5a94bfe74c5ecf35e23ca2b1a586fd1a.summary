-- @entity1 is a religion of compassion and mercy , considering that the two adjectives most used in the @entity6 to describe @entity7 are the " compassionate " and the " merciful			1
" it is also a religion of justice			2
throughout @entity1 history , many non-muslims would take their disputes to @entity15 courts , over their own religious courts , because of the firm injunctions in the @entity6 and @entity15 law to adhere to high standards of justice			1
it is for this reason that , as an imam , i am deeply distressed to hear that a young @entity25 girl in @entity26 was accused by her angry @entity28 neighbors of burning text from the quran , @entity1 's holy book , in violation of the country 's blasphemy laws			1
reportedly , the girl is mentally challenged and used the pages for fuel			0
some say that she may also be illiterate			0
after several hundred emotionally charged people surrounded her house to demand punishment , the police arrested her as a way to protect her			0
there is neither justice , compassion nor mercy in what has happened to the girl			1
@entity26 must champion @entity1 as a religion of peace and not allow a handful of extremists to define it for all @entity28 ; such extremists confuse ordinary @entity28 into thinking that @entity15 law is about punishment rather than about promoting harmony and human flourishing			1
the muslims in @entity26 must display the highest expression of @entity1 values and principles			1
they must manifest the mercy and wisdom of one of the early @entity1 leaders , @entity67 , who suspended the punishment for theft during a time of famine so as to best fulfill the intention of @entity7 's law			2
i call upon @entity28 in @entity26 to reject the accusations against the girl and live up to the highest ethical standards set forth by @entity7 and his messenger			1
it is not right to be angry and to want to punish a young girl for unknowingly burning words from the @entity6			1
according to @entity1 tradition , " works are rendered efficacious only by their intention			2
" in other words , the intention to commit a crime is a primary consideration in @entity1 law			2
it was not the girl 's intention to blaspheme against the @entity6 , as she is mentally challenged and could not have understood the content of the pages			0
as a minor , the girl can not legally incur punishment			0
in the @entity1 school of law practiced in @entity26 , one must demonstrate competence in making socially responsible judgments			1
this girl could not have demonstrated competence in her judgment			0
furthermore , burning the physical book of the @entity6 is not an act of blasphemy			0
it has always been an acceptable means of disposing of an old copy of the @entity6			0
in @entity1 theology , the @entity6 is not a book but rather , as the name means in @entity114 , the recitation of @entity7 's word			2
@entity28 use the printed copies as a memory aid in reciting this word , a word which can never be defiled			0
and lastly , to prevent this kind of incident from repeating in the future , we must turn to the help of the state			0
according to the objectives ( maqasid ) of @entity1 law , the government must try to eradicate the poverty that drove the girl to scrounge for paper for fuel , as an obligation to provide sustenance in " promoting wealth			1
" the government must actively work toward creating harmony between @entity26 's various faith communities , a key aspect of fulfilling the objective of " preserving religion			1
" and it has the responsibility to provide schooling for all citizens so that they can read as part of " preserving the mind			0
" @entity28 must be characterized by loving humanity , by upholding justice and by showing kindness toward their neighbors , even to the extent that should someone offer you a deadly poison , give him the choicest honey in exchange			2
within @entity1 history , the @entity28 community has been known for such qualities			1
it is time again to take up that mantle and act always in the name of @entity7 , the most compassionate , the merciful -- b - ism @entity163			0

a young @entity25 girl in @entity26 was accused of burning text from the quran
@entity170 : muslims should not be angry at the girl , they should show compassion
he says @entity26 must not allow a handful of extremists to define @entity1 values
@entity170 : @entity1 is a religion of peace and justice ; @entity28 must live up to its standards
