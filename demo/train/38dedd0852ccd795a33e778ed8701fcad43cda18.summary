-- a court 's investigation into alleged financial irregularities by football club @entity6 in its purchase of @entity9 superstar @entity8 should be expanded to include tax evasion by the club , a @entity2 prosecutor argued wednesday			1
prosecutor @entity12 formally asked a judge , who is already investigating a former @entity6 president in the case , to expand the preliminary investigation , according to a copy of his writ viewed by @entity0			1
the prosecutor alleges that the club avoided paying 9 million euros ( more than $ 12 million ) in taxes on @entity8 's signing and transfer , corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013 , through a series of financial maneuvers			2
@entity8 joined @entity6 in june 2013 , with his father -- who doubles as his agent -- having entered into an initial contract with the @entity2 giants in late 2011			1

the request to expand the investigation came wednesday in a eight - page writ from the prosecutor , who alleges that he 's " become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club , and in favor of various companies , related to the signing of @entity76 , based at times on simulated contracts			1
" it may take several days for @entity58 to consider the prosecutor 's request at @entity2 's @entity82 in @entity83 , said a court spokesman , who by custom is not identified			2
the investigation originally came after season - ticket holder @entity87 complained that the amount paid to bring @entity8 from @entity9 club @entity90 was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros			1
a day after @entity52 resigned , the club released figures that showed that @entity6 actually paid 86.2 million euros for @entity8			0
