-- the $ 410 billion budget president @entity2 signed wednesday will make it easier for @entity4 residents to travel to @entity6 and to send money to family members on the island			1
it also could facilitate the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to @entity6			1
the residents of @entity15 , @entity6 , often rely on bicycle taxis for transportation			1
three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by then - president @entity21 after he came to office in 2001			1
analysts see the move as a way for the new @entity2 administration to start thawing relations with @entity6 one month before the @entity28 brings together the @entity4 president and 33 other leaders from the @entity31 in @entity32			1
" [ @entity6 ] is the issue of greatest symbolic importance , " said @entity33 , president of the @entity36 - based @entity35 policy institute			2
" it will be seen as a test of real @entity4 readiness to change in the hemisphere			2
what he says about @entity6 will make headlines			2
" @entity33 testified about @entity47 policy wednesday before the @entity48			0
@entity6 and the @entity4 have had a troubled relationship since @entity50 came to power in 1959			1
the @entity4 broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 and imposed a trade embargo in 1962			2
@entity21 tightened some of those restrictions in recent years , most notably limiting travel to the island to once every three years for a limit of 14 days			2
under the new provisions , relatives will be able to go once a year and stay for an unlimited time			0
in addition , the definition of relatives has been broadened to include uncles , aunts , nephews and nieces			0
the new measures also increase the amount of money visitors can spend			2
@entity72 , who served presidents @entity73 and both bushes in a number of high - level @entity47 posts , also testified wednesday before the @entity48			0
@entity72 and @entity33 have different perspectives on how far @entity2 should go on improving relations with @entity6 , but they agree that attaching the latest measures to the spending bill was the wrong way to do it			1
" it 's important to open up @entity6 , but it should be done systematically , " @entity33 told @entity0			2
" this is very important for the @entity85 community			0
it ought to be done with them at the table			0
if they 're not involved , they 're going to push back			0
" initial opposition from two @entity93 senators with large @entity85 @entity47 communities in their states put the spending bill in jeopardy			1
senators @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity100 of @entity101 voted for the budget tuesday after receiving personal letters from treasury secretary @entity104 assuring them that the new provisions will not alter @entity4 policy			1
@entity72 said he did not like the @entity6 provisions in the budget because the @entity4 gets nothing in return			1
" i 'm opposed to it because of the way it was done , " he said			0
" there 's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in @entity6			2
i do n't approve of the unilateral way it 's being done			0
the embargo is a negotiating tool			0
we should not negotiate with ourselves , and that 's what we 're doing			0
" @entity33 warns that too much should not be read into the new measures , saying , " the fact is that this is very minor			0
" @entity127 , director of the @entity128 , said in a policy statement wednesday that the new provision " suffers from being too little and too late			0
" similar measures have been attached to previous spending bills in the past eight years but @entity21 threatened to veto the legislation , so the language was scrapped			1
senators @entity98 and @entity100 were most concerned with the provision that allows cash advance sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to @entity6			1
before @entity21 , " cash advance " used to mean that money would have to be paid as soon as the goods reached @entity6			1
but the @entity142 said " cash advance " had to mean money was sent before the cargo was loaded on ships in the @entity4 for @entity6			1
the language in the new spending bill reverts the meaning to the previous " cash - on - delivery " method favored by @entity4 farmers and exporters			1
some members of @entity155 also were concerned the new provisions would allow credit sales , which would poke major holes in the economic embargo			0
but @entity104 's letters to @entity98 and @entity100 assured them this would not happen			0
he did tell the senators , though , the @entity2 administration is reviewing its policies toward @entity6			1
@entity0 @entity166 producer @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
