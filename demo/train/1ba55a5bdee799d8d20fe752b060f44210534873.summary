ironically , the misogyny @entity0 spewed for three days over @entity1 was not much worse than his regular broadcast of sexist , racist and homophobic hate speech : -- female @entity5 members are " sex - retaries			1
" -- " the @entity7 should have riot rehearsal			0
they should get a liquor store and practice robberies			0
" -- the @entity12 is " a bunch of whores to liberalism			0
" -- [ @entity16 to an @entity18 female caller ] : " take that bone out of your nose and call me back			0
" these are just a few samples from the arsenal of degrading language @entity0 deploys on women , people of color , lesbians and gays , immigrants , the disabled , the elderly , @entity32 , jews , veterans , environmentalists and so forth			1
@entity0 does n't just call people names			1
he promotes language that deliberately dehumanizes his targets			0
like the sophisticated propagandist @entity38 , he creates rhetorical frames -- and the bigger the lie , the more effective -- inciting listeners to view people they disagree with as sub-humans			0
his longtime favorite term for women , " @entity50 , " does n't even raise eyebrows anymore , an example of how rhetoric spreads when unchallenged by coarsened cultural norms			0
at least this most recent incident has turned a spotlight back on the vile , damaging statements @entity0 has been promulgating for years			1
his sponsors are dropping him ; his stations have begun to follow suit			0
@entity57 , a coalition of @entity59 and @entity60 veterans , released a statement by female vets , including @entity63 , former chief of medical operations in the @entity66 @entity65 , demanding that the @entity68 drop @entity0 from its programming			2
they state , " our entire military depends on troops respecting each other -- women and men			0
there simply can be no place on military airwaves for sentiments that would undermine that respect			2
" opinion : it 's un-american to silence @entity0 that makes this a fitting time to inquire of his syndicator , @entity85 , whether it intends to continue supporting someone who addicts his audience to regular doses of hate speech			1
@entity85 's @entity91 , which hosts @entity0 's program , has defended his recent comments			1
if @entity85 wo n't clean up its airways , then surely it 's time for the public to ask the @entity97 a basic question : are the stations carrying @entity0 's show in fact using their licenses " in the public interest ? " @entity104 is a scarce government resource			1
radio broadcasters are obligated to act in the public interest and serve their respective communities of license			1
in keeping with this obligation , individual radio listeners may complain to the @entity97 that @entity0 's radio station ( and those syndicating his show ) are not acting in the public interest or serving their respective communities of license by permitting such dehumanizing speech			1
opinion : democrats should reject @entity121 's money the @entity97 takes such complaints into consideration when stations file for license renewal			2
for local listeners near a station that carries @entity0 's show , there is plenty of evidence to bring to the @entity97 that their station is n't carrying out its public interest obligation			1
complaints can be registered under the broadcast category of the @entity97 website : http://www.fcc.gov/complaints this is n't political			2
while we disagree with @entity0 's politics , what 's at stake is the fallout of a society tolerating toxic , hate - inciting speech			2
for 20 years , @entity0 has hidden behind the @entity145 , or else claimed he 's really " doing humor " or " entertainment			2
" he is indeed constitutionally entitled to his opinions , but he is not constitutionally entitled to the people 's airways			0
it 's time for the public to take back our broadcast resources			0
@entity0 has had decades to fix his show			1
now it 's up to us .			0

@entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 : @entity0 long made racist , sexist , homophobic remarks
his most recent incident drew *strong* rebuke , some *advertisers* have dropped him
they say @entity85 should dump him ; if not @entity97 should *evaluate* station licenses
*writers* : airwaves scarce government resource ; his show not " in public interest "
