editor 's note : @entity2 founded @entity3 , a site featuring multicultural political commentary			1
he is host of a nationally syndicated @entity6 - language radio show and wrote a guide to success for immigrants ( " @entity10 ! " published by @entity11 )			2
he is co-founder and president of @entity13 , an advocacy marketing agency based in @entity14 , @entity15			0
@entity2 says the lives of @entity18 presidents can make them positive role models for students			1
@entity14 , @entity15 ( @entity21 ) -- perhaps we got too used to living in a nation where the president inevitably becomes persona non grata			0
maybe after the @entity26 and @entity27 years , we forgot how to give a president a chance to serve not just as a punching bag but also as a role model			1
have we become so disenchanted and polarized we ca n't give our own president a chance to teach our children something about what it takes to succeed ? as a small - town boy , i drew inspiration from presidential biographies			1
as i got lost in the adventures of @entity43 , the spirit of @entity45 and the ideals of @entity47 , i found kernels of @entity18 's greatness			1
in those pages , i unearthed a yearning to dream beyond my surroundings , to strive for more , to seek a way to contribute to our nation			0
many of the leaders , including @entity58 , born in a log cabin in @entity60 , ascended from humble beginnings on the wings of education to guide @entity18 forward			1
devouring their stories , it ceased to matter where i was from or how far removed i was from the centers of power			2
with an education and a dream -- in @entity18 -- anything was possible			1
whenever president @entity71 addresses our youth , he embodies the power of education			1
education is the cornerstone of our democracy , the key to upward mobility , a linchpin to transforming whimsical dreams into actionable goals			2
raised by his widowed mother in @entity85 , he became a @entity86			0
emerging from a broken family , he built on degrees from @entity89 and @entity90 in his odyssey to the @entity92			0
hailing from @entity94 , he attended @entity95 on his way to heroism			0
from both sides of the aisle , education has propelled the career trajectories of our nation 's leaders			1
even if we disagree with a president 's policies , we should accept he can serve as a role model in a broader way			1
for example , @entity47 owned slaves			0
nobody would argue this was admirable			0
but @entity47 was also a great thinker , diplomat and strategist			0
he co-authored the @entity116 and helped @entity18 become a global power by engaging @entity118 and transacting the @entity119			1
was he perfect ? of course not			0
would we want our children to emulate his every action			0
but has he been an inspirational role model over time ? as a parent , i understand people 's concerns about the concepts to which their children are exposed			2
but the content of the president 's speech to students should assuage any worries regarding his motives			1
clearly , his agenda is to inspire kids to make the most of education in building a better life , not to brainwash a generation to do his bidding			2
pointing to his own experiences , as well as those of others from diverse and modest origins , his remarks convey the importance of personal responsibility , perseverance and education in fulfilling one 's potential while contributing to our nation 's future			2
the only way to argue with that is by confusing the issues , twisting the situation into something it was never intended to be			0
it 's gotten so bad , some folks do n't want their kids exposed to the president because they 're afraid he 'll teach them socialism			2
my answer is that even if he did plan to discuss socialism , they should let their child listen			0
of course , the president would n't do that , but why is that my answer ? because , as another role model -- president @entity182 -- once said : " all great change in @entity18 begins at the dinner table			1
" in that light , the president 's speech is n't a threat but an opportunity for families to engage their children on the issues			1
if parents disagree with the president 's views , they can sit down at the dinner table with their kids and explain their divergence			2
they may even find , when it comes to the value of education , president @entity71 might say something worth hearing			1
in the process , parents will teach their children : that we should listen respectfully to others			0
doing so , we might realize that we can appreciate certain aspects of a person while disagreeing with others , and that partial differences of opinion need n't always spur absolute rejection			0
that we should respect the president because , even if we did n't vote for him , we 're still one nation			0
that we should give our president an opportunity to lead by example			0
@entity71 's presidency is still young			1
we do n't know what shape his legacy will take			0
but given his resume , regardless of politics , he 's an excellent role model on the value of education			1
why not give him a chance to serve in that capacity ? ireport.com : share your thoughts on @entity71 's speech just as i found inspiration in those biographies during my childhood , our youth might be moved by the president 's words and stories to cherish knowledge and learning , harnessing the power of education to grow into productive , exemplary @entity18 in their own right			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : after @entity26 , @entity27 years , presidents are n't viewed as role models
he says he drew inspiration from the lives of @entity18 presidents
he says @entity71 and others show the power of education to improve society
he says letting students hear @entity71 's speech can give them a positive message
