-- if the still raging fires did n't destroy their homes , @entity2 residents could be done in by flash flooding this monsoon season -- the ravaged landscape heightening the danger , and likelihood , of mudslides and other problems			1
despite rain over the weekend , the @entity13 fire continues to burn around @entity15			1
nearly 1,900 personnel have worked to contain 45 percent of a blaze that 's scorched more than 146,000 acres and more than 100 buildings , according to the website of the federal @entity20 that is overseeing the firefight			1
with monsoon season having just kicked off , more precipitation could help firefighters contain the wildfire , one of several still burning in the @entity27			0
yet it is not all good news , as torrential downpours -- which will likely occur into september -- may also cause further ruin in already hard - hit areas			2
" it will simply take just one thunderstorm in the right area of a burn scar to potentially have devastating affects , " @entity34 meteorologist @entity33 said			0
" that could happen tomorrow or tuesday , or a month from now , or both			0
" @entity41 , a spokeswoman for the @entity42 @entity45 's @entity44 team , explained that forests , shrubs and other flora generally mitigate the impact of monsoon rains			0
such plant life largely has been charred and flattened by the weeks - long @entity13			1
and the fact that the fire has affected acres upon acres of hilly , mountainous terrain makes fast - moving mudslides even more dangerous -- and likely			1
" there 's no vegetation left on the landscape to keep the water in place when the monsoon hits , " @entity41 said			2
@entity33 added , in an e-mail to @entity0 , that " severely burned soil can be a water repellent " and effectively act like pavement , with water quickly flowing over it and bringing ash , silt , sand and assorted debris along with it			1
" ( those mudslides ) then may damage or destroy culverts , bridges , roads and buildings , potentially causing injury or death , " he explained			0
that danger is imminent in northern and central @entity2			1
a monsoon " burst , " meaning a period of intense rain , was expected monday and tuesday in the area that 's been a hotbed for wildfires since last month , said @entity33			2
that 's why the weather service issued a flash flood watch into monday evening for a large swath of @entity2 including the @entity93 and @entity95 mountains			1
between a half inch to an inch of rain could fall within 30 minutes at times			0
still , even though it is now monsoon season , that does not mean that new fires could n't break out or that old ones could not continue to spread			0
as @entity33 noted , there likely will be " breaks " over the summer with little to no precipitation , and possibly high temperatures and strong winds			0
on sunday night at @entity110 , for instance , the humidity was 18 % to 20 % , the weather service said -- even though thunderstorms could hit within hours			0
that continued wildfire danger is why @entity114 and @entity115 continue to keep the @entity116 , @entity117 and all open space areas closed to the public -- even with rains on the way -- the city 's website reports .			2

the @entity13 fire is 45 percent contained , having burned more than 146,000 acres
as the fire rages , a flash flood watch is issued for northern and central @entity2
an official notes that in places there 's no vegetation to contain intense rainwater
a meteorologist says fire - scarred areas seem water - repellent , acting like pavement
