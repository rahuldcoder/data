@entity0 -- in a time of voter anger at unsustainable government spending and @entity7 hypocrisy , here 's a story that should get your blood up			1
last week , the @entity11 considered eliminating a nearly half - billion dollar earmark that was snuck into a defense authorization bill			1
but members of both parties voted to keep the corporate pork in the bill -- despite a supposed moratorium on earmarks and despite that the @entity20 has repeatedly said it does n't want the money			1
only in @entity7 would bureaucracy be force - fed a project it does n't want or need			1
but so far , we have n't seen this contempt for taxpayer dollars make its way to protest signs or talk radio driven talking points			0
that 's because president @entity33 opposes the earmark and the @entity36 congressional leadership voted for it			1
this does n't fit neatly into the hyperpartisan narrative of screaming about socialism -- in which @entity36 bewail overspending by @entity43 -- but it 's a perfect illustration of how deep the dysfunction is in @entity7			2
at issue is the alternate engine for the @entity48 platform , a corporate subsidized boondoggle that has cost taxpayers $ 1.2 billion in earmarks since 2004			2
it is estimated to cost at least $ 2.9 billion more until its completion			0
defenders argue that paying @entity56 and @entity57 to develop a second engine for @entity60 fighters will stimulate competition in the defense industry and bring down costs in the long run while protecting jobs in the short run			2
critics point out that crony capitalism ca n't create a true free market in the defense industry -- it 's the equivalent of diet hucksters who claim you can eat yourself fitter			2
this is about money : pork barrel politics hiding under the noble banner of national defense			0
here 's how the sordid story unfolded : an anonymous earmark was added to the defense authorization bill , requesting $ 485 million in new funds for the alternate engine program , despite a much - ballyhooed moratorium on earmarks going to for - profit entities ( agreed to by @entity43 ) , and a total ban on earmark requests agreed to by @entity36 for fiscal year 2011			1
in reaction , a small bipartisan group of members of @entity92 -- led by @entity94 @entity93 of @entity95 and @entity36 @entity96 of @entity97 , joined by @entity94 @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity36 @entity100 of @entity101 -- proposed an amendment to strip the bill of the ugly anonymous earmark			2
their principled stand went down to defeat by a vote of 193 to 231			0
it 's no surprise that in a recession , the congressional representatives of @entity111 and @entity112 would vote to keep the earmark subsidy in the bill , including the normally stalwart fiscal conservative @entity116 of @entity112			0
those states are benefiting most from the development of the engines in terms of jobs on the ground			0
what 's more surprising is why so many of their colleagues would climb on this pork - barrel bandwagon , including the @entity36 congressional leadership led by @entity129 and @entity130 , who are trying to build the midterm election campaign around a promise to restore fiscal discipline			2
that selling job that should be even tougher since a majority of @entity43 voted to kill the alternate engine and a majority of @entity36 voted to keep it going			1
" this was the first big earmark test for 2010 , and @entity92 failed , " said @entity139 , the president of @entity140 , which has been a steadfast critic of the alternate engine and recently released a detailed report on the subject			0
" neither party comes out looking good , but @entity36 in particular missed a golden opportunity to show that they are really serious about getting government spending under control			1
" the next chance to stop the half - billion dollar alternate engine earmark is the @entity151 , when it takes up the defense authorization bill later this month			1
but even success there from genuine fiscal conservatives such as @entity157 could be undone when the bill goes to conference -- it 's the @entity7 way			0
the final stop would be a presidential veto , which president @entity33 has promised , under advice from defense secretary @entity163			0
a half century ago , @entity36 president @entity164 warned about the influence of the military - industrial complex			1
the former five - star general crusaded against government waste , especially in the military , because he knew that a figure with lesser credibility could be attacked as being " soft on communism " for proposing responsible cuts from the @entity20 budget during the @entity174			1
we are at war today on two fronts , even as we face down a fiscal crisis and escalating deficits and debt			0
we owe it to our troops to see that every dollar allocated to the military is spent where they need it , not where congressional appropriators want it			0
and if fiscal conservative protesters can not marshal their energy to oppose this half - billion dollar boondoggle , then it is not just @entity92 ' hypocrisy they should be angry at -- it is their own			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity11 defeated a bid to kill a defense spending project that @entity20 says it does n't need
@entity196 says @entity36 critics of government spending voted for half - billion dollar project
he says this was a clear - cut case of a way to cut the budget deficit
@entity196 asks how @entity36 can run on platform of cutting spending while supporting this project
