a man apparently wielding an ax looms over a figure lying spreadeagled on the cobbled road , clad in red overalls			0
the first man turns to face the camera as it passes and watches , ax in hand , as it drives into the distance			0
almost more disturbingly , swiveling around on @entity12 , a man stands watching the grisly scene , hand nonchalantly resting on his hip			2
all three faces are blurred			0
but the identities of the two men at the center of the tableau are far from a secret in this corner of @entity24			1
the man lying seemingly lifeless on the ground is @entity27 , who has owned and run the @entity28 on @entity29 -- in the @entity24 district of @entity31 -- for 30 years			1
above him , longtime employee @entity32			2
zoom closer and , through the distortion , @entity32 's expression could make you shudder			1
the " axman " is laughing			0
his boss and apparent victim is chuckling too , when he describes the hoax to @entity41			0
@entity27 and @entity32 have been at the center of much media attention in @entity44 after a local newspaper picked up the story of their @entity12 " murder			1
" but it took a while			0
the photos , @entity27 reckons , were taken around august 2012			2
" @entity29 is like a misshapen horseshoe			0
by chance , i saw the @entity12 car going in other leg			1
i knew it would reach us in half a minute , " he says			0
" i had just enough time to whip in , grab @entity32 and a pick - ax handle and he came out to give me a so called ' @entity31 massage , ' which is essentially being bashed			1
" @entity32 has worked at the @entity28 for more than a decade , and was " right up " for the prank , @entity27 said			1
he said @entity12 had apparently uploaded the images and some months later the company was alerted when one of its suppliers rang it up " in fits of laughter			1
" @entity27 said it was more than a year before someone apparently alerted the police , who he says " very properly " came around to check out the incident			1
" a @entity77 [ female police officer ] has her car serviced here and she said ' i know exactly what 's going on here -- it 's a wind up			2
' " they came in and said ' you guys , do you happen to know anything about this ? ' we explained what had happened , " @entity27 said			0
" they were smiling when they came in and were roaring with laughter when they left			0
" @entity27 said that he had n't heard from @entity12 about the prank but speculated that the publicity it had generated would be very good for the company			1
" it 's nothing obscene , but now a lot more people know about @entity12 -- so i would think this must be a joy to them			2
" when @entity41 contacted @entity12 about the prank , the company declined to comment			0
@entity27 fears that his tableau may not be long for the cyberworld			2
" infuriatingly i think last thursday the @entity12 car went past and we had n't set anything up , " he said			1
" i expect there will ll be a lot of copycats of this now but the trick is spotting [ the @entity12 car ] in time			1
" as for the police , they told @entity41 they would " always respond to any reports of concern for personal safety			0
