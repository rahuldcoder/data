-- so , about all those experts and analysts who 've spent the past year or so saying @entity3 was going to make a phone			1
a new expert has stepped forward to say it 's not going to happen			2
and his name is @entity8			2
@entity3 's ceo on thursday threw cold water on rumors that have simmered for months the networking giant has been working on its own smartphone			1
" there are lots of things that you can build in other operating systems , as well , that are n't really like building out a whole phone , which i think would n't really make much sense for us to do , " @entity8 said in response to a question about the phone during the site 's first earnings report			1
his comments seem to fly in the face of the scuttlebutt that 's made its way onto blogs and news sites across the @entity34 ( including this one ) for some time now			2
as recently as two months ago , the @entity35 was reporting that " employees of @entity3 and several engineers " as well as ( the , of course , anonymous ) " people briefed on @entity3 's plans " were saying the company hoped to release a phone by next year			1
these unnamed folks told the @entity35 it was @entity3 's third effort at phone - building , dating back to 2010			1
and the @entity49 's @entity48 blog sounded pretty sure of itself last year , letting us know the @entity3 phone is real , the site was working with @entity53 to make it and that its code name was " buffy , " after the noted vampire slayer			1
on the earnings call , @entity8 emphasized that mobile computing is key to the company 's future strategy			1
so far , despite earning millions , @entity3 does not sell ads on , or charge for , its mobile app. increasingly , smartphones and tablets are becoming the most frequent way people access social media			1
" well , @entity3 is the most used app on basically every mobile platform , right ? " @entity8 said			1
" so when we think about what we want to do right now , we want to increase the depth of the experience in addition to just growing users			0
we want to not just have apps that people use but also be kind of deeply integrated into the systems as possible			0
we want to support a development ecosystem , where other apps can build on top of @entity3			2
" so what will @entity3 's next move in mobile be ? stay tuned , @entity8 says			1
" i think we 're really much closer to the beginning here than the end in terms of what we can do , " he said			0
" if you use the apps today , they 're relatively basic compared to what i think anyone can imagine they would want from their @entity3 experience on a phone			2
" so that settles it , right ? not so fast			0
in the tech blogosphere , it 's hard to keep a good rumor down			0
@entity48 responded to the report with a post titled " @entity104 , despite @entity105			0
" the logic ? nobody ever said @entity3 itself is building the phone			2
an existing phone maker would build it for the site			0
" his comments still leave tons of room for the company to be doing most of the work on a phone , while working alongside one or many partner manufacturers to do the actual hardware , " @entity112 wrote			0
" even @entity122 could arguably say it does n't manufacture phones -- @entity124 builds the phones -- and @entity122 is the most profitable phone maker in the world			0
" so there you have it			0
let the speculation resume .			0
