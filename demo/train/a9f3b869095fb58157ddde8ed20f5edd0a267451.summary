@entity0 has a dream to open a fine dining cookery school in @entity3			1
he founded the @entity4 three years ago to create a network among his country 's best cooks and encourage them to improve their skills and now has 270 members			1
but he believes there 's more to do in developing fine dining			1
@entity0 himself trained at @entity13 in @entity14 and is now in charge of in - flight catering at @entity17			1
" most @entity3 chefs begin without proper training , " said @entity0			1
" we have some courses but they do n't take people to the level they need			0
" as a result young chefs are n't surviving long in the market			2
they are leaving the industry after two or three years because they do n't get paid a lot and the competition is so high			2
" i wish everybody could have proper training			0
" @entity3 's food scene is quickly becoming more varied -- and healthier -- as it incorporates influences from around the world , @entity0 said			1
" @entity3 have traditionally eaten too much lamb and not enough salad or vegetables , " he said			2
" but that 's changing			0
people are mixing more ingredients with influences from @entity42 , @entity43 , the @entity44 and all over the @entity45			0
" @entity0 appeared as a judge on the @entity45 version of the @entity48 reality show top chef when it was launched by @entity50 , the @entity52 broadcaster , last year			2
the winner of the series was @entity55 , a @entity56 - born chef who works in @entity3 as executive chef at @entity58 , the international bakery chain			2
the prominence of fast food franchises is one of the issues that bothers @entity63 , an @entity64 chef who has worked in @entity65 , @entity3 , for six years			1
" the country has developed a lot in food and hospitality , but there 's still a lot of @entity48 influence and fast food , " said @entity66			1
" there are four million people in @entity65 and only two or three fine dining restaurants , but probably 100 branches of fast food franchises			1
" like @entity0 , @entity66 wants to open a hospitality school to help develop young chefs			1
" a lot of the younger @entity3 want to improve their skills , " said @entity66			2
" i 'm working with the @entity84 in @entity65 , but it takes time			0
hopefully we will open later this year			0
" @entity66 is executive chef at @entity87 in @entity65 , which was highly commended in the @entity88 of last year 's @entity3 excellence in @entity90			2
when @entity66 first moved to @entity3 , he only planned to stay a couple of years , but six years later he has no plans to leave			1
" there are more restaurants opening all the time			0
alongside the @entity3 and @entity45 restaurants , there are @entity64 restaurants and @entity100 has really taken off in the last few years			1
" one person taking advantage of that boom is food lover @entity104			0
he started a food blog in 2006 and developed it into full eating out website called @entity108 in 2008			0
he now has 56,000 @entity110 followers , almost 14,000 registered users , 31,000 unique monthly users and 28,000 downloads of his @entity115 app. the website , which has a recently launched @entity117 version , @entity118 , provides restaurant listings , news and user reviews			0
" i love eating and entertainment in @entity3 is quite limited , so dining out became important for me socially , " said @entity104 , 29			1
" before we launched , @entity3 did n't have any forum for people to review and recommend restaurants			1
" @entity104 , who employs a staff of six , says @entity65 has a vibrant restaurant scene with foods from all around the world			0
" it 's a multi-cultural city and the gateway to @entity136 and @entity137 , which shows in the food , " he said			0
" from sushi to @entity142 , @entity64 and @entity52 food , it mirrors a lot of the trends from @entity14 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
" @entity104 's favourite food , however , is from closer to home , the @entity149 dish of ful medames , made from mashed fava beans with olive oil , chopped parsley , onion , garlic and lemon juice .			0

too many restaurants in @entity3 are fast food chains , say chefs there
@entity4 was founded three years ago and has 270 members
chefs @entity0 and @entity63 are both aiming to open fine dining cookery schools
