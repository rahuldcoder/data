@entity0 -- opponents of a bill that would overhaul the 1978 @entity4 blocked consideration thursday of the controversial bill until after the july 4 recess			1
sen. @entity8 , @entity9 , says the @entity4 overhaul legislation is " deeply flawed			1
" @entity13 @entity12 leaders announced the delay because of a filibuster spearheaded by sens. @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity16 , @entity17			1
but the measure is expected to pass by a large margin with the support of both major parties ' presumptive presidential nominees , sen. @entity23 and sen. @entity24			1
language that appears likely to let telecommunications companies escape lawsuits over the @entity30 administration 's warrantless surveillance program has drawn sharp opposition from @entity32 such as @entity8 and @entity16			1
" i 'm pleased we were able to delay a vote on @entity4 until after the july 4 holiday instead of having it jammed through , " @entity8 said			1
" i hope that over the july 4 holiday , senators will take a closer look at this deeply flawed legislation and understand how it threatens the civil liberties of the @entity43 people			1
it is possible to defend this country from terrorists while also protecting the rights and freedoms that define our nation			0
" " i 'm pleased that consideration of the @entity52 has been delayed until after the 4th of july recess , " @entity16 said			1
" i urge my colleagues to take this time to listen to their constituents and consider the dangerous precedent that would be set by granting retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that may have engaged in president @entity30 's illegal wiretapping program			2
" when and if @entity4 does come back to the @entity13 floor , i will offer my amendment to strip the retroactive immunity provision out of the bill			2
i implore my colleagues to support the rule of law and join me in voting against retroactive immunity			2
" the @entity66 voted last week to overhaul @entity4 , which requires a secret court to sign off on domestic electronic surveillance in intelligence cases			1
the law was passed in 1978 in response to @entity73 - era wiretapping abuses			0
the @entity30 administration and the bill 's supporters argue that modern technology requires that the law be updated to allow intelligence agencies to spy on phone or internet traffic overseas that might be routed through switches in the @entity43			0
" as telecommunications technology has changed , intelligence agencies have been presented with collection opportunities inside the @entity43 against targets overseas , " said sen. @entity83 , the @entity12 chairman of the @entity84			2
" yet because of the way @entity4 was written in 1978 , they could not take full advantage of these new opportunities			0
" supporters say the new bill requires court oversight of communications intercepts and will prevent presidents from launching another program like the one the @entity30 administration acknowledged in 2005			0
@entity23 , who had said he would oppose any bill that would toss out lawsuits against the phone companies , has said he will support the new proposal			1
he said it makes sure that in the future , " somebody 's watching the watchers			0
" " given that all the information that i 've received is that the underlying program itself actually is important and useful to @entity43 security , as long as it has these constraints on them , i felt that it was more important for me to go ahead and support this compromise , " @entity23 said wednesday in @entity108 , @entity109			2
president @entity30 acknowledged in 2005 that he ordered the secretive @entity118 to intercept communications between @entity43 residents and people overseas suspected of having ties to terrorism			0
the administration insists that the program was authorized when @entity126 approved military action against @entity128 after the terrorist network 's 2001 attacks			0
but @entity32 and some leading republicans in @entity126 say it violated @entity4 , which required intelligence agencies to get court approval before spying on @entity43			0
the revelations led to several lawsuits against the phone companies that cooperated with the program by people who suspect they were targets of the wiretaps			0
the @entity30 administration has refused to share records of the program with federal courts , invoking a " state secrets " privilege .			0
