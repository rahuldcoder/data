@entity0 -- amid the cacophony of political analysis and reporting around the midterm elections , here 's a user 's guide -- our effort to slice and dice the story lines for what you need to know from now till november			1
return of the establishment republicans : but will it mean @entity18 victories in the fall ? the tea party 's candidates have failed to catch on in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , to name a few			1
absent any onetime witches in the field , there 's no guarantee that the @entity20 faithful will turn out in droves to push sen. @entity30 over the finish line to re-election in november			2
wherefore art thou , independents ? are they disenfranchised conservatives or middle - of - the - road voters who are thoroughly ticked off at @entity0 ? either way , will they vote ? 3			2
minimum wage / minimum gain ? will @entity41 get a minimum return on the time they have invested on the issue ? president @entity46 continually pushed for an increase in the minimum wage throughout the year			2
he 's been taking it to voters outside the @entity51			0
but is the issue doing what @entity41 are hoping for and energizing their base ? 4			0
@entity55 and the border : will house speaker @entity55 take immigration reform to the floor ? will he buck his caucus ' most conservative members ? and if so , will it have any effect on who turns out to vote ? 5			0
embrace the @entity64 : can @entity41 effectively run on the parts of the @entity66 that the public likes ? will the public still like any of it as the year wears on ? who 'll run away from it , and who 'll run on it ? and with polls showing almost half of the country now wanting to tweak it instead of throwing it out , can running on the @entity80 theme gin up the conservative base as much as some in the @entity18 expect ? 6			1
the 2016 @entity18 field : fired up and ready to go ... but to where ? 2014 midterms : what 's at stake 7			1
meet the @entity88 : where will they campaign ? will they focus their efforts on early primary states , or will they leapfrog directly to the 2016 purple states ? and when they 're campaigning , will we hear them selling the @entity46 years or laying out their rationale for @entity100 's expected 2016 run ? 8			1
the other ones : where , if anywhere , on the campaign trail will we see the 2016 @entity41 - in - waiting like @entity105 gov. @entity104 , @entity107 sen. @entity106 and @entity109 sen. @entity108 ? what are they selling ? 9			2
who 'll rise from the masses ? if the @entity18 are looking outside the @entity51 for their 2016 champion , who 'll most effectively use 2014 to stand out from the rest ? 2014 key races to watch 10			1
the economy , the economy , the economy : there are only five more jobs reports between now and @entity119 ; is there a silver lining or a sliver of hope for @entity41 that @entity46 's economy will be their life raft rather than their anvil ? 11			0
the first couple : as @entity46 seems relegated to collecting checks at @entity41 ' fundraisers , will the first lady hit the hustings ? 12			0
where 's @entity133 ? : keep track of how many times vice president @entity135 pops up in @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 in the next six months			0
@entity142 's @entity141 : how successful will the @entity144 governor be at getting @entity141 governors elected ? will he have gathered enough chits and contacts within the @entity18 's donor class to revitalize his vision of sitting in the @entity150 ? 14			1
marijuana on their mind ? will there be a " higher " turnout in @entity156 and @entity157 , where voters will get the chance to legalize pot ? could those states keep the @entity163 blue ? 15			0
@entity165 backlash : is it a cold that could develop into a flu for @entity41 ? while they might brush aside rep. @entity171 's special committee as a joke , the @entity18 base will eat it up			0

@entity141 primaries will indicate *strength* of establishment *vs.* the tea party
@entity66 will play a role in the outcome ; the *question* is how *big*
2014 midterms will be the opening act for 2016 presidential elections
