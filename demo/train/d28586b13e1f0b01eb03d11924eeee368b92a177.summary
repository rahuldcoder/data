-- many were shocked this week when @entity3 player @entity2 was arrested and charged with first - degree murder and linked to an unsolved double - homicide case from 2012			1
the tone in the sports community has been muted because this is occurring during the off - season and the impact on the " game " is minimal			0
there are many unanswered questions about the @entity2 case			1
what does it tell us about the intersection of sports and the violent and sometimes criminal behavior of athletes off the field ? with a few exceptions , the @entity24 's governance of players ' lives is restricted to behaviors that impact the game and the business of the league			1
players who violate the law and the rights of others are subject to the much broader laws that govern every citizen			2
when players commit crimes such as murder , looking to the league for answers is not the solution			1
the @entity3 have quickly cut ties with @entity2 but are faced with a " dead money " issue ( the ironic name for money tied to a player no longer with the team , that counts against a team 's salary cap )			1
on the field , they are left with a more uncertain hole at the tight end position			2
there 's a sentiment that on - field performance is all that we should be concerned with when it comes to sports and athletes			2
no more was that on display than this past @entity65 where the most popular player on the field was @entity68 , who 13 years ago was in a similar position as @entity2 is today			1
@entity68 was in jail charged with murder			1
while he was later exonerated , @entity68 has been , in part , redeemed by football			0
as incidents of violence increase in volume and severity it is becoming more difficult to ignore the social transgressions of athletes simply because they entertain us			0
the bigger question is : what is the tipping point ? the dissonance regarding sports in our society is palpable			2
the @entity24 is the most successful and powerful sports entity in the world			1
for many , it symbolizes the greatest elements of the meritocracy of sports and business			0
success is built on sound principle , discipline and character			0
the @entity24 's success is not simply due to the popularity of the game itself , but the business of monetizing the game			1
the players are merely widgets in that business			2
however , as the @entity24 continues to grow in revenue and appeal , the off - field behavior of some of the players threaten to tarnish the pristine veneer of the brand			1
the sport has an esteemed place in our culture by helping to build communities , teaching young people leadership and discipline , and promoting team spirit			0
but why is it that so many successful athletes -- those who have reached the pinnacle of their game -- seem to lack discipline in their lives away from the game ? why is there such a glaring discrepancy ? the problem for the @entity24 is that there is little the league can do to influence the behavior of its current players			1
the @entity24 is not the nurturer of men ; it is not responsible for the attitudes and behaviors of the men its teams employ			1
as the great former @entity147 basketball coach @entity146 once said , " sports do n't build character			0
" while the players on the field are stars of the business , they are not stars because of their depth of character or values and judgment			1
their individual moral compass is their own , even if the sport has some influence over their perception of the world			0
their stardom lies in the volume of exposure the business affords them			0
and , like the mega-salaries that make headlines , the business is such that the individual does n't matter			0
what matters is that the individual can get the job done in the context of the business			0
and , in this case , character and discipline off the field have no relevance to success on the field			0
@entity24 players are products of our collective society and they take center stage in one of the most successful enterprises of our society			1
when we hear about @entity2 or @entity193 , we should n't assume that it 's solely an @entity24 problem			1
it 's a larger societal issue			0
no child is born to be an @entity24 player			2
the young men who grow up and are recognized for their talents need to be more than warriors on the field			0
the positive influences outside of their athletic lives need to be stronger and at every stage of their lives			0
the pursuit of excellence can exist in all aspects of a young athlete 's life and it should begin with civility before any games are played			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity216 : many are shocked that @entity2 was charged with murder
@entity216 : when players commit *heinous* crimes , the @entity24 does n't have answers
he says there is little the league can do to influence the behavior of its players off field
@entity216 : @entity24 players are products of our collective society
