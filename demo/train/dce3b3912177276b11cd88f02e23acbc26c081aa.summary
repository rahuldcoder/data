@entity0 -- two more people have died from a rare strain of bird flu in @entity5 , as health officials investigate possible cases of transmission between family members			1
the latest fatalities occurred in @entity12 and @entity13 provinces -- both in eastern @entity5 -- and brought the total number of deaths from @entity17 avian influenza to nine , from 28 reported cases , according to the state - run @entity20 news agency			1
so far the virus has been limited to the east of the country , with infections reported in the @entity27 region , as well as in the provinces of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity29			1
a total of 13 cases , including five resulting in fatalities , have been reported in @entity27 alone , where the authorities are considering a permanent ban on the trading of live poultry after culling more than 100,000 birds in the past week in an effort to contain the problem			0
while the source of the infection is unknown , poultry markets have become the focus of the investigation by @entity5 's health ministry and the @entity46 ( @entity46 )			1
the virus had been known to affect pigeons but had not previously been discovered in humans until a series of cases were reported in @entity5 last week			2
other cities across @entity5 have announced plans to suspend trading in live birds			2
authorities in the city of @entity58 took this a step further by announcing a ban on the trading of livestock and live poultry would come into effect from midnight on tuesday , according to a statement from the @entity67 -- though the @entity46 says no positive samples of the @entity17 virus have been found in pigs or farms in @entity5 so far			1
meanwhile , the @entity46 is investigating suspected " family clusters " of people who may be infected with @entity17 , potentially the first evidence of its spread between humans			2
" at this point , there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission , " said @entity46 spokesperson @entity77 , in quotes carried by @entity20			1
but he added that there are some " suspected but not yet confirmed cases of perhaps very limited transmission between close family members			0
" according to @entity77 , one of the suspected family clusters was in @entity27 , with three family members having similar symptoms and one of them being confirmed of @entity17 , @entity20 said			0
two -- one confirmed and one suspected @entity17 case -- have now died , @entity77 said			0
the other suspected cluster is in @entity13			0
however @entity77 cautioned that even if an infection is confirmed in another family member , further investigations would be required to ascertain whether it is actually a human - to - human transmission between constant and close contacts or a viral infection from the same environmental source , @entity20 said			1
despite assurances tuesday from vice premier @entity104 that every effort would be made to prevent the spread of infections , @entity5 netizens were taking to social media to voice their fears			2
