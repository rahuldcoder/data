-- the importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days			1
employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job ; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor - intensive			1
on the other hand , job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report , but employers are getting smarter and finding references you did n't provide			1
so , what 's the deal ? do references matter ? do employers even check them anymore ? what 's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer ? who are the best people to include as references ? and , if an employer does n't call any of your references , is it a bad sign ? while the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer , overall , yes , references do still matter			1
the process has just changed			1
" references play a huge role in the hiring process , perhaps now more than ever , " said @entity39 , founder and president of come recommended , an online community that connects internship and entry - level job candidates with employers			1
" oftentimes , hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview , only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again			0
by checking a candidate 's references , hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company			1
in this economy , where hiring budgets are slim , every hire must be a great fit			0
" provided references are no guarantee though the majority of employers do check references , others skip this step			1
not only is it labor - intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer , but @entity78 , adjunct professor at the @entity79 , said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references			1
" [ hiring ] decisions can not be based on information that is discriminatory in nature , so to avoid any liability , the checks are forgone , " @entity78 said			0
" sadly , the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun			1
" @entity95 , director of career development at @entity96 , adds that sometimes , the quality of references is benign			2
" everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees , but in the end , they offer little substance to a new employer , " he says			2
" legally , they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees			0
i think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields			2
" @entity95 warns that just because an employer is n't checking personal references the traditional way does n't mean he is n't checking references at all			1
" employers are more likely to check the informal , but tangible , behavioral reference sources like @entity119 , @entity120 , credit history [ or ] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates , " he said			1
" candidates should be much more intentional about crafting a professional identity that serves the role of a ' reference ' but within the context of the work , profession and colleagues you seek to engage			1
it eliminates the weaknesses inherent in the old style of references that become so watered down they are useless			2
" making the right choices the last thing you want to do is give an employer useless references , but many job seekers make the mistake of not taking the time to thoughtfully choose the right people to speak on their behalf , said @entity149 , managing partner for @entity150 , an outplacement and talent management consulting firm			1
" you want people who can speak to your role as a professional , not as a nice neighbor , " @entity149 said			2
" candidates can make their references count by prepping them to discuss their specific skills as they relate to the job and the impact they brought to the job , which can be just the differentiation needed in this highly competitive market			1
" @entity78 agrees that when he receives a résumé with references attached , he gives them virtually no weight			2
" they seldom are specific to the role my company seeks and are not meaningful in considering qualifications or traits of successful candidate , " he said			0
finally , when it comes to protocol for submitting references , the process has changed as well			1
it used to be that applicants sent them in with their other application materials , but now , @entity149 says , you should wait to provide references until you are asked			2
" most companies do not want your references until the end of the process and they will let you know when to provide a list of names and contact information			1
do not send written references , " she said			2
" these do not offer the highest impact as they are not specific on how you will fit into the job you are pursuing			0
it is better to spend your time preparing your references for the kinds of questions they will be asked , and what they can do to help you close an offer			2
" helpful hints @entity78 , @entity149 and @entity95 offer these 10 tips to ensure you do everything right when it comes to providing references : 1			2
include references only when requested by an employer			1
carefully consider whom to provide after discussion with the prospective employer			0
the time to check references is before an offer is made , but after the candidate is either the final candidate or among the final few for the job			0
seek references from people who actually know you and your work			1
ask for permission to list them as a reference			0
ask directly if they can provide you with a positive reference for the position ( s ) you are seeking			0
if they hesitate , move on ! 5			0
