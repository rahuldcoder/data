@entity1 , @entity2 there 's no shortage of politicians in @entity2			1
but the capital of the world 's largest democracy appears set to hand over the reins of power to an activist			2
@entity1 votes this weekend to elect a new state administration			2
in the race for the city state 's top job are two anti-corruption protesters â€” @entity17 and @entity18			1
both were comrades - in - arms some four years ago when a massive anti-graft movement swept the country			1
they also share a common background as civil servants			0
now , the two stand as rivals to rule the state of @entity1 , the center of @entity2 's politics			1
prime minister @entity29 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) has handpicked @entity17 , a former policewoman , as its candidate for the city 's chief minister			1
in this , it sidestepped old , political loyalists			0
the move , analysts say , was calculated			0
in @entity1 , the @entity28 is faced with stiff competition not from career politicians but from @entity18 's two - year - old @entity40 ( @entity41 or @entity42			1
the upstart group of activists stunned the country 's politics when it surged to a close second place in city elections in 2013			2
@entity18 , a former tax official , became the capital 's chief minister after he struck a coalition deal with the @entity52 that his @entity42 had pushed to the third spot in the legislature			2
with that , the @entity28 lost the opportunity to govern @entity1 despite winning the largest number of seats			2
" this time , it has taken the pulse of voters			0
it has fielded @entity17 , an activist without a political record , as its face in the capital			0
this completes the setting by pitting an activist against an activist			0
one of them is going to make it , " said @entity68 , a @entity1 - based political commentator			1
@entity18 's stint as @entity1 's chief minister lasted 49 days , when he resigned after @entity1 lawmakers from other parties rejected an anti-corruption bill his government proposed last year			1
his short term was marked by his trademark activist - type sit - ins and run - ins with electricity and water utilities over tariffs			2
critics labeled him a quitter for resigning prematurely			0
and his party flopped in last year 's national elections			0
still , @entity18 remains a darling of a large section of @entity1 voters divided along layers of economic classes facing day - to - day problems in the congested city , observers say			1
known for his populism , the 46 - year - old maverick is seen to be successfully tapping into his constituency of lower - income groups			0
his aap has promised 500 new schools , 20 new colleges , greater investment in public transport and tens of thousands of new public toilets in the city of more than 17 million people			0
" his support base among the middle - class and the elite may have eroded for quitting office abruptly last time , but he appears to have the backing of economically - weaker communities because of his promises , " says @entity68			0
@entity18 and @entity17 were two of the main strategists of the 2011 anti-corruption agitation that rattled the then federal government of @entity2 's oldest @entity52			1
during those demonstrations , @entity17 rose to prominence after her scathing attacks on politicians and flag - waving made her a central figure			0
then , hundreds of thousands of @entity2 hit the streets to protest endemic graft and called for cleansing the nation 's political system			1
a winner of @entity131 's premier @entity130 , @entity17 has a history of courting public attention , which has made her a household name in @entity2			1
as a young traffic officer , she was nicknamed " @entity140 " for her clampdown on wrongly - parked cars			0
she also received international acclaim for reforming @entity143 jail , @entity2 's largest prison complex , after taking over as its inspector - general in 1993			1
as the candidate for @entity28 , @entity17 faces a close contest against @entity18			0
but the @entity52 appears out of the picture and headed for its worst - ever defeat in @entity1 , according to opinion polls released this week			1
as front - runners for chief minister , both @entity18 and @entity17 have vowed to make the city safer			0
the fatal attack and rape of a student in a moving bus in 2012 brought international spotlight on @entity1 and its public safety			2
in its election manifesto , @entity42 has promised a million cctv cameras across @entity1 and free wifi			2
the upcoming election in @entity2 's capital megacity is also billed as a popularity test for prime minister @entity29			1
his grand rise to national power last may is often called the @entity29 wave			2
the prime minister has received praise for his reform - minded initiatives and impressive oratory			0
at the same time , his @entity28 and affiliate @entity177 groups have come under fire for sporadic @entity177 - @entity180 clashes over the past few months in parts of the country			0
also , @entity29 's party is in a minority in the @entity185 , the upper house of the @entity2 parliament			1
that limits his efforts to push his economic agenda			0
winning states in the coming years is therefore crucial for @entity29 's government as regional lawmakers play a key role in electing the upper parliament members .			1

two activists *vie* for @entity1 's top job
both were comrades - in - arms some four years ago during massive anti-graft movement
election also tests @entity2 's pm @entity29 's *influence*
