-- two young @entity2 parents smiled at me , showing mock desperation as their little boy and girl eagerly dragged them into a shop famous for its pistachio ice cream sandwiches			1
around the corner , filling the side of a 15 - story building , a government - sponsored propaganda mural showed a perverted @entity15 flag , with skulls for stars and falling bombs for stripes			1
@entity2 women must wear a scarf , but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead			1
that bizarre mixture -- of saber - rattling politics alongside the personal warmth of individual locals -- is what struck me on my recent 12 - day trip to @entity2 to film a public - television show			1
i found @entity2 to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land i 've ever visited			1
and i learned a lot			1
the country is not free			1
it seems that people -- motivated by fear of @entity39 influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy			2
parents told me , " we do not want our girls to grow up to be @entity48 , " and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal			2
they feel their " revolution of values " provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex , drug abuse and crass materialism of the @entity54			2
@entity2 women must wear a scarf , but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead			1
after several days , that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage			2
making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible , @entity2 women , per capita , lead the world in nose jobs			1
faces are beautifully made up , and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious			2
before arriving in @entity2 , i was so afraid of @entity71 that we had nearly left our big expensive tv camera in @entity74 and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model			1
but once there , i found people curious , courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were @entity15			2
i 've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of @entity2			1
@entity82 is modern and bustling , with thriving shopping malls , cars clogging the streets and most people wearing @entity39 - style clothes			2
unlike many @entity90 capitals , minarets do not dot the skyline , and i barely heard a call to prayer			2
and yet it 's clearly a theocracy			2
multiple tv stations broadcast religious programming ( along with @entity98 and @entity99 ) that 's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea , or the pilgrimage center in @entity105 in real - time			0
in the @entity15 , billboards and ads encourage us to consume , but in @entity2 , government - sponsored billboards , @entity110 and tv programming is all about the teachings of great holy men			1
i asked my guide if it 's okay to be non-muslim in @entity2			1
" yes , " he said , " we have religious freedom , as long as it is not offensive to @entity118			0
" @entity119 ? " sure			0
" @entity120 ? " sure			0
" @entity121 ? " no. we believe that @entity122 -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet , so the @entity121 prophet ( 19th century ) is offensive to @entity118			0
" i asked , " what if you want to get somewhere in the military or government ? " my guide answered , " then you better be a @entity90 -- a practicing , @entity90			0
" every film crew stops at the former @entity15 embassy			0
it was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the " @entity135 " and held 52 @entity15 hostage for 444 days			0
for @entity2 back then , it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years			1
the embassy wall is still covered with anti-american murals painted at that time			0
but the hostage crisis was 30 years ago			0
most @entity2 were n't even born then			1
it 's ancient history to our young guide			0
with our work done , we hurried to catch our flight home			0
as we crawled through @entity82 's traffic , our driver cursed , " death to traffic			0
" shocked , i said , " what ? i thought it was death to @entity15			0
" he said , " here in @entity2 , when something frustrates us and is out of our control , we say ' death ' to that			1
" then i thought , when people in my society say , " damn those teenagers , " they do n't mean they wish them to die and burn in hell for eternity ... they just want the kids to turn down the music			0
boarding our plane , the @entity175 flight attendants -- so stylish with hair flowing freely -- seemed to welcome us as if onto a life raft			0
women pulled off their scarves , wine was poured , and we flew west with the raw footage of a program we hoped would humanize a proud country of 70 million people			0
