-- when other people suffer misfortunes , we feel sorry for them			1
or do we ? more than we probably want to admit , we sometimes are secretly pleased			1
does a @entity5 fan feel happy to see a @entity7 fan miserable over a humiliating loss ? would a @entity10 ever tire of watching replays of @entity14 's @entity13 moments ? do you find yourself consuming the tabloid news , riveted by coverage of disasters in the gossip columns ? the @entity21 language has a word for this feeling , schadenfreude , or , pleasure caused by the misfortunes of others			1
most people feel uneasy taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others			1
our parents gave us stern , shaming looks if we laughed when others got into trouble			2
maybe this is one reason why there is no word for schadenfreude in some languages , such as @entity40			1
just because we do n't have a label for it in @entity40 does n't mean the feeling does n't exist			1
it 's very real , and you must have experienced it at some point in your life , or know someone who has			0
so , why do we feel schadenfreude ? one reason comes down to the simple fact that we often gain from other people 's misfortunes			1
much of life involves competition			0
@entity57 advised , " never interrupt an enemy when he is making a mistake			0
" misfortunes happening to rivals can level the competition			1
any sympathy we might feel is mixed with the pleasing effects of the benefit that may come our way			1
self - interest is a powerful motive , and it is only natural to feel good if we are gaining from an event , even if it is from another person 's misfortune			1
a team of @entity75 researchers led by @entity76 recently provided good evidence for this in the blood sport of politics			1
in a series of studies published in the @entity84 , they screened participants for their party allegiance and then asked them to privately give their emotional reactions to news events , some of which were embarrassing to either the @entity10 or @entity93 presidential candidates from the 2006 and 2008 elections			0
overall , @entity95 were much more pleased than republicans when a @entity93 candidate suffered and @entity93 were much more pleased than @entity95 when a @entity95 candidate suffered			2
these two groups seemed to live in separate parallel universes			0
such findings come as no surprise to anyone who follows politics and who feels the effects of the election outcomes in the gut			2
comedian @entity108 captured the point during the summer of the most recent presidential campaign , when the economic indicators were looking bad for the incumbent , @entity112 , " i 've got some good news and some bad news			0
the good news is there 's plenty of bad news , which is great news for @entity14			0
" the studies led by @entity76 used private reports , but were the participants being completely frank ? did they even know their true feelings ? @entity125 neuroscientists @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 in a study published in @entity130 provided more corroborating evidence for schadenfreude using sports fans rather than political junkies			1
they took advantage of the natural , storied rivalry between the @entity5 and @entity7 , and recruited diehard fans from each group			2
these fans watched simulated baseball plays while placed in a brain scanner			0
the plays involved their own team playing against their rival or playing against a neutral team			0
pleasure - related brain activation was linked with the rival losing ; pain - related activation was linked with their own team losing			0
notice that these examples come from intergroup competition			0
often , our identity with a group affects our emotions			0
if our group comes out on top , that gives us a boost			0
in a classic demonstration , research led by @entity161 at @entity162 showed that @entity165 fans felt more optimistic about their own personal abilities ( from throwing darts to success in asking attractive people out for a date ) after their team won than after it lost			2
as a long - suffering @entity5 fan , i can attest to the elixir provided by " our " defeating the @entity7 ' in the @entity176 playoff in 2004 and then going on to win the @entity177			0
there is something about intergroup dynamics that brings emotions like schadenfreude out into the open			1
the tribal , " us " vs. " them " mindset seems easily evoked , and it is thrilling to win at a rival group 's expense			0
maybe , we feel less guilty and selfish in our pleasure when it 's " for the team			2
" @entity191 is a natural feeling , and there is little use in berating ourselves over its easy arousal			1
but let 's not encourage it , either			0
apparently , those who experience schadenfreude may also express willingness to harm a rival fan or group			2
so let 's keep schadenfreude in check			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity210 : when people suffer misfortunes , we feel sorry for them , or do we ?
@entity208 : more than we probably want to admit , we sometimes are secretly pleased
he says in sports , politics , schadenfreude tend to be brought out into the open
@entity208 : @entity191 is a natural emotion , we should n't berate ourselves for feeling it
