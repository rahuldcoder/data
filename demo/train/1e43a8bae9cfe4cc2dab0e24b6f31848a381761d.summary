ever wanted a @entity2 swimsuit edition with even more curves ? plus - size model @entity4 teamed up with swimsuits for all last year to recreate the 2014 cover with bigger models			1
now she does n't need to invent an alternate version of the magazine			0
@entity4 , who is a size 12 , is the first plus - size model and one of seven " rookies " featured in the 2015 swimsuit issue , on newsstands tuesday			1
a size 12 ? that 's still smaller than the average @entity19 woman , who wears a size 14			1
but in a fashion world where wearing a size 8 and standing 5 ' 8 " can be considered " plus - size , " the magazine featuring @entity4 is a stitch closer to most women 's reality			1
it 's true that no one expects @entity2 's annual display of skin and teeny tiny bathing suits to be a realistic portrayal of average @entity19 women			1
but the models are usually so , so thin			0
with @entity2 rookie @entity4 and other larger - than - size 2 models busting out all over , refusing to let beauty be defined by the skinny few , could it the year of the plus - size model ? @entity4 is n't even the only one in the magazine			1
@entity42 , the size - inclusive swimsuit company that collaborated with @entity4 last year , has an advertisement featuring plus - size model @entity45 in this year 's swimsuit issue			1
although , as @entity48 has pointed out , that means " @entity50 accepts @entity51			0
the photo is n't part of the magazine 's editorial content , but really ? it 's not clear that " readers " will care			2
@entity58 , @entity60 's ceo , could n't be more delighted with the attention his campaign is getting			2
" the celebration of curves that we are witnessing right now is so important , " said @entity58 , via email			0
" tastes and body types change over time and curves have never been more ' in '			0
" add to the list plus - size model @entity71 , who was recently signed to @entity74 - based @entity73			2
she got more press for effyourbeautystandards , an @entity78 account she started in 2013 for women to celebrate their bodies and unique looks			2
@entity71 is a size 22 and stands 5 feet 5 inches			0
" i 'm always still that 13 - year - old girl in @entity84 who people told i was n't good enough , " she said			0
" i never could have imagined that i could be here			0
" why no @entity2 swimsuit issue of men ?			1
