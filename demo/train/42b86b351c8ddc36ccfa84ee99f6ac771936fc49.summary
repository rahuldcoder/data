-- naturalist @entity1 has been exploring and celebrating wildlife since she was a child , whether discovering the great whales of @entity4 with her parents or creating a special luxury habitat for her backyard frogs			1
as a young girl she gazed with longing at photos of grizzly bears and wolves , and vowed to see the charismatic mega-fauna of the @entity14			2
she realized her dream in her 20 - year career in environmental leadership has included work at @entity20 and @entity21 national parks			1
she 's the director of the @entity24 's @entity23 office , living just outside @entity20			1
@entity25 has wandered extensively throughout @entity20 's backcountry , hiked the @entity27 , swam the mile - long @entity28 in @entity20 and run the @entity29 with her father and " survived " ( her word ) the @entity31 : a 12.4 - mile trek entirely uphill gaining 3,000 feet in elevation to arrive at the entrance of @entity20			1
to mark @entity36 2013 , @entity0 asked @entity25 to share some of her favorite spots to find nature			2
here are some of her recommendations and what makes each wild place special , in her own words : @entity44 , @entity20 , @entity23 @entity20 is my favorite place on @entity47 , and the area near @entity49 is my favorite place in @entity20			1
my annual rite of spring is hiking the @entity53 trail			1
depending on the snowpack levels , in some years i 've trekked through deep snow , while in other years the trail has been bone dry			1
@entity53 offers an array of wonders -- five shimmering blue , subalpine lakes , views of @entity20 's high peaks , colorful spring wildflowers like lupine and monkey flower , and ruins of the @entity69 silver mine			1
there are also possible encounters with some of my favorite critters : the unbearably cute pika and the annual spring love songs of the @entity20 toad and @entity77 chorus frogs			1
this trail starts right at the @entity49 entrance station ( almost 10,000 feet in elevation ) and is great for all levels of hikers as you can stop at the first view ( about three - quarters of a mile ) and call it a day or do the whole five - mile loop			1
the first three - quarters of a mile is all uphill , but you are rewarded with stunning views of @entity20 's high country at the top , including the @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 as well as middle @entity96			1
do n't stop there , as the rest of the hike allows you to wander through a sublime , expansive basin and is much less strenuous			2
@entity101 , @entity21 , @entity102 when i worked in @entity21 and people asked me what to do if they only had a day in the park , i would recommend the @entity101 hike			1
@entity21 is in @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity102 , but @entity101 is in @entity102			1
it 's easily the best trail in @entity21 in terms of bang for your wildlife , wildflower and scenery buck			1
in just the drive alone to @entity101 in springtime , no matter what your approach , nature will reward you with some unprecedented wildlife sightings , as it 's the seasonal baby boom in @entity21 , which includes the adorable orange bison calves , and gangly elk youngsters , along with grizzly and black bears cubs			1
@entity126 is the best time for wildlife viewing in @entity21 , and my record is eight grizzly bears , one wolf and one moose ( and countless bison , bighorn , pronghorn and elk ) in one day			1
@entity137 is usually awash with yellow flowers in springtime as well			2
on the hike , you 'll be strolling through wildflower gardens , which usually peak in july and august			2
and you 'll likely encounter the herds of bighorn sheep that frequent the rocky terrain			2
it 's rare to see rams here , but the cuteness of the playful antics of the young lambs more than compensates			2
the hike to the summit is six miles round trip and with access usually in june , just depending on the snowpack			2
@entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 on a visit to the @entity158 a few years ago , i searched of course for frogs ( the park has 13 species of frogs and toad ) , but saw a bright red salamander crawling on a rock during a hike , and when i asked my guide about its species , i learned an amazing fact -- the @entity175 are known as the " @entity176			2
" the area houses five families of salamanders and 30 species			2
they are nicknamed " spring lizards " in the @entity184 , although they are technically not lizards			1
the @entity186 salamander , the largest in the @entity175 , can reach 29 inches in length			2
some places to see salamanders in springtime , near any wet area in the park , include @entity193 at the @entity194 ; @entity195 ( the tallest waterfall in the park ) ; @entity199 self - guiding nature trail , which starts from @entity201 's @entity200 ; and @entity202 for the @entity186 salamanders			1
the @entity204 is one of the best hikes for wildflowers and also pretty good for salamanders			2
@entity208 , @entity209 i recently discovered the beginning of this incredible trail with magnificent views of @entity23 's rocky coast when i went to @entity215 at @entity208 in search of @entity217 , the first river otter in @entity209 in more than 50 years			1
while i snapped photos of him swimming playfully in the bathhouse ruins , someone yelled , " dolphins			2
" i turned around and saw bottlenose dolphins and their calves swimming in the @entity77			2
for wildlife , more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted here			1
@entity229 is the big bird migration , but springtime is no slouch either ( april and may )			2
for me , what makes this hike special ( now that @entity217 has ventured off in search of a mate ) is the possibility of marine mammal sightings			1
aside from the bottlenose dolphins i saw , you might also observe gray whales and harbor porpoises			0
harbor porpoises have recently returned to the @entity244 after 65 years , and it 's always great to see them frolicking			0
i recommend doing the easy 3.5 - mile trip that starts at @entity215 near the @entity248			0
if it 's clear , you 'll get a view of the @entity251 and the @entity252 , walk among willows , cypress and @entity255 , and see some native wildflowers			0
@entity257 , @entity109 and @entity102 the late @entity259 travel correspondent @entity258 called @entity260 212 , or @entity257 , " the most beautiful road in @entity260			0
" for me , it 's true			0
my jaw dropped open in awe the entire drive ; this was a continual scenic vista on steroids			0
i recommend you drive this magnificent 67 - mile highway by all means , but get out of the car as well			0
there are many beautiful lakes to see a short walk from the road			0
the @entity279 trailhead , one mile east of the @entity276 at the end of a short road to @entity279 , provides as much or as little a hike as you like			0
be sure to look ( and listen ) for pika along the route			0
besides frog , pika are a favorite critter of mine			0
these intrepid creatures live at high altitudes and do not hibernate in the winter			0
instead they gather vegetation in haystacks to dry for winter forage			0
and they are also unbearably cute			0
listen for their distinctive high - pitched chirping as you walk through rocky terrain			0
and the springtime wildflowers are stunning			0
i cherish the delicate sky pilot because the flowers seem to me like precious gems worn by the mountains			0
but the endless meadows filled with a purple - blue ocean of lupine , or the sunset orange - red of the @entity311 paintbrush ( @entity102 's state flower ) will leave you speechless			0
the road usually opens , depending on snow conditions , mid-april to mid-june			0
@entity315 , @entity316 in college , i drove across country every summer , visiting national parks and other wild areas			0
one year i visited friends in @entity322 , @entity316 , the @entity323 capital of the world			0
as we strolled along the @entity315 , i was disappointed to learn i would just miss the fall stop over			0
the @entity327 migration is a truly remarkable event			0
more than 80 % of all of the world 's sandhill cranes ( about 500,000 ) make a pit stop in spring here before heading north to their summer breeding grounds			1
in addition , more than 10 million ducks and geese travel here as well			0
that 's a lot of birds			0
the spring migration runs from february to april			1
if you want to avoid the crowds and get out of the cars , birding friends recommend the @entity345 such as at @entity346			0
in the @entity322 area , @entity348 's @entity347 offers tours for a fee			0
@entity352 , @entity353 @entity4 is my childhood wilderness , where i came to love both nature and the outdoors because of my parents ' affection for the place			1
we vacationed there annually throughout my youth , and eventually moved to the edge of @entity4 , @entity365 , when i was in high school			1
i remember my dad taking me to see beached whales as a kid -- and live ones on whale watching trips -- and swimming in the waters of @entity352			0
my favorite discovery on the beaches of @entity4 was the horseshoe crabs			1
these relics from the dinosaur age transfixed me , and i would collect what i thought back then were dead horseshoe crabs -- i now know it 's their molted shells -- and bring them home to study			1
finding a live one in the water was always a delight			0
watching the horseshoe crabs spawn by the full moon , which they do generally from april to june , has always been a highlight for me			1
in my talks about @entity23 wildlife , i always end with a photo of a horseshoe crab , even though we lack the animal on the @entity398			1
for me these ancient creatures engendered my love of wildlife , and they remind me of the wonder of running around the beaches of @entity4 as a kid , excitedly searching for these prehistoric creatures in the soft sand .			1

an annual rite of spring is hiking the @entity53 trail at @entity20
@entity101 is the best trail in @entity21 in terms of bang for wildlife buck , naturalist says
children can search the beaches of @entity4 for prehistoric horseshoe crabs
