opponents of president @entity2 's plan , which makes sweeping changes to the nation 's immigration system by use of executive order , focused their criticism on the legal case , saying @entity2 has overstepped the boundaries of his authority and is ignoring the will of the people			1
republicans started attacking the plan long before and soon after the president 's prime - time address to the nation thursday night , as @entity20 activists and lawmakers took to tv , their emails and their @entity24 accounts to call out the commander - in - chief			1
" by ignoring the will of the @entity31 people , president @entity2 has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left , " house speaker @entity26 said in a statement after the speech			1
" his ' my way or the highway ' approach makes it harder to build the trust with the @entity31 people that is necessary to get things done on behalf of the country			0
republicans are left with the serious responsibility of upholding our oath of office			0
" related : democrats , @entity20 take immigration fight to @entity24 across the right , high profile @entity20 -- including potential 2016 @entity49 hopefuls -- vented their rage at an executive branch they see as out of control and out of touch			2
former @entity55 gov. @entity54 called @entity2 's action " ill - advised " and said it " undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis " that should come from @entity60			1
" president @entity2 has once again put divisive and manipulative politics before the sober leadership and sound laws required of an exceptional nation , " @entity54 said in a statement			1
" it is time for @entity20 leaders in @entity60 to act			2
we must demonstrate to @entity31 we are the party that will tackle serious challenges and build broad - based consensus to achieve meaningful reforms for our citizens and our future			0
" @entity77 sen. @entity76 said he " will not sit idly by and let the president bypass @entity60 and our @entity79			0
" " president @entity2 is not above the law and has no right to issue executive amnesty			2
his actions blatantly ignore the separations of @entity85 and the principles our country was founded on			0
the president has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration , " @entity76 said in a statement			0
the @entity20 seemed to take little comfort in @entity2 's explanation that his actions were in line with other actions past presidents had made			1
" his actions are not only unconstitutional and in defiance of the @entity31 people who said they did not want amnesty in the 2014 elections , but they are also unfair to every immigrant who has come to our nation legally , " sen. @entity97 of @entity98 posted to his @entity100 profile			0
other @entity98 @entity20 said that the president 's actions were not only lawless but also ineffectual			1
" the president 's decision tonight will lead to more illegal immigration , not less , " @entity98 gov. @entity110 said in a statement			2
" it is time for the president and @entity60 to secure our border , followed by meaningful reforms			0
there is no more time for political grandstanding			0
" former @entity124 sen. @entity123 , the second - place finisher in the 2012 battle for the @entity20 presidential nod and a potential 2016 contender , called the executive order " just another in a long line of power - grabs by this administration			0
despite saying as recently as one year ago that he was not the ' emperor ' of the @entity31 , this president simply does not believe that the executive is a co-equal branch of government			0
" @entity55 sen. @entity138 , though , offered a more muted reaction -- focusing his criticism on how @entity2 handled the changes he announced thursday night			1
" we need immigration reform			0
but the right way to do it is to first bring illegal immigration under control by securing the borders and enforcing the laws , then modernizing our legal immigration system , " @entity138 said in a statement			0
" after we do these things , we will eventually have to deal with those here illegally in a reasonable but responsible way			0
the president 's actions now make all of this harder and are unfair to people in our immigration system who are doing things the right way			2
" the attorneys general in @entity98 and @entity160 both said they were planning lawsuits challenging @entity2 's authority to overhaul immigration rules without the approval of @entity60			1
in @entity98 , attorney general @entity166 , who is weeks away from becoming governor , said in a statement he is " prepared to immediately challenge president @entity2 in court , securing our state 's sovereignty and guaranteeing the rule of law as it was intended under the @entity79			1
" some @entity20 were working on ways to block @entity2 from implementing his immigration order			1
sen. @entity177 of @entity178 posted on @entity179 his case against the president 's proposal			2
" i will try to defund the effort for him to go at it alone , " @entity177 said in a video post thursday night			2
" we will challenge him in court			0
" others said they 'll look to government funding bills			0
@entity191 sen. @entity190 pledged on @entity24 that he will do " everything i can " to stop @entity2 's move , " starting with removing any funding for amnesty			1
" @entity197 sen. @entity196 said @entity2 's " executive fiat " hurts chances of working with a @entity20 - dominated @entity60 on an immigration reform bill			1
he said in a statement that @entity2 's executive action " not only lacks legal justification , but will set back important bipartisan efforts to reform our broken immigration system and secure our nation 's borders -- causes i have long supported			1
" @entity210 chairman @entity209 -- who just two years ago , in the wake of the @entity20 's 2012 electoral defeat , endorsed a report that called on his party to support an immigration overhaul -- blasted @entity2 for both his policies and for acting as a " one - man legislature			1
" " the last time the president issued a politically motivated executive order to change our immigration laws , he precipitated a crisis at our border , leaving thousands of children at risk and ripping apart the families he claims to want to protect , " @entity209 said			2
" granting amnesty does not secure our borders			0
sadly , rather than trying to solve our country 's immigration problems , the president 's actions are intended to poison the legislative process at a time when he should be working to bring @entity31 together .			1
