two trucks full of armed men race closer to the resulting crater at the @entity5 army camp in @entity6			1
the black - clad militants chase the survivors , killing all the soldiers			2
all of it is captured on video			0
at least 31 @entity13 soldiers were killed in the october attack , the deadliest to date committed by the @entity6 - based militant group @entity15 ( champions of @entity17 )			1
@entity15 militants released video of the ambush in mid-november -- just days after pledging allegiance to @entity22 , the @entity23 terror group that now controls large parts of @entity25 and @entity26			1
the footage , which also shows a number of drive - by shootings and roadside bomb blasts , suggests that the group 's firepower and strategic planning is becoming more sophisticated			0
@entity15 operates primarily in @entity34 , an area where rolling sand dunes butt up against the @entity36 and stretch to rocky mountains in the center of the @entity39			2
for years this corner has been dubbed " the most dangerous part of @entity13			1
" since 2011 , the group has been attacking @entity44 interests in @entity6 by repeatedly blowing up a gas pipeline leading from the @entity13 @entity46 to @entity44			1
the group stepped up the frequency of its raids after @entity13 's army overthrew president @entity50 -- a former @entity51 leader -- following a popular uprising in july 2013			1
hundreds of @entity13 troops have since been slaughtered in this low - level insurgency			1
in the two months leading up to the october 24 massacre at @entity5 , the group more than doubled its attacks in @entity6 -- killing 62 police officers and soldiers , according to @entity59 , an @entity13 @entity61 affiliate			1
while looting weapons from @entity5 , a militant proclaimed to the camera : " tell the leader of @entity22 , [ @entity64 ] @entity65 , the leader of the faithful , that you are coming here and we are your soldiers			1
" the group has changed its logo and its name to @entity73 -- " the @entity74 " -- positioning itself as part of the bigger @entity22 " caliphate " that extends from northern @entity25 to central @entity26			2
several other militant groups from the region have also pledged allegiance to @entity22 , including in @entity80 , which shares a long porous border with @entity13 that is known for being an arms - smuggling route			1
these pledges benefit @entity22 , whose territorial expansions have already peaked and are now stagnant , explains @entity86 , from the @entity87 at @entity88			2
" it may well be very possible that @entity15 decided that in order for it to maintain its own type of momentum , to become part of a broader transnational group , would be in its own interest , " @entity86 told @entity90			2
observers note the scarcity of verified information coming from @entity6 ; the military limits access to the wild terrain believed to be the group 's home and the surrounding towns and villages			1
most concerns about @entity15 's recent pledge of allegiance to @entity22 are focused on the possible increase in recruitment and expertise			1
" first thing it means is that any @entity13 currently fighting with @entity22 and @entity115 in @entity25 or @entity26 have a second arena to go and fight in without leaving the group , " @entity86 said			1
" they 'll add that expertise , they 'll add that training to the capacity of [ @entity15 ]			2
" unlike @entity22 , @entity15 mostly refrains from targeting civilians			1
the group has almost exclusively attacked the government , aside from one recent @entity15 video purporting to show the beheading of four civilian men who were accused of spying for @entity44			1
in a video claiming responsibility for the attempted assassination in 2013 of @entity13 's minister of interior , @entity15 said it chose the site of the suicide bombing to minimize @entity51 civilian casualties			1
it pits itself as a defender of the people against what it calls the " apostate " army			0
its statements often cite videos of @entity13 's army attacking protesters in 2011 , the killing of more than one thousand @entity50 supporters in august 2013 and , most recently , a leaked video of @entity13 soldiers torturing two @entity148			1
@entity15 also cites pictures of militants killed by security forces in @entity6 as further proof of abuses			1
" you all saw what [ security forces ] did to @entity157 in @entity13 and in all squares			2
this army has crossed all lines			0
this army did what the @entity164 did n't do with his people , " warns an unidentifiable militant in one @entity15 video			1
" we will kill you all , you apostates			0
" sitting in front of a cache of weapons supposedly taken from the @entity5 camp , @entity15 's presumed leader said he would free the " prisoners of war " held by authorities			1
" we told you before , the war has n't started yet			0
and what 's coming is worse and bitter			0
this is only the beginning			0
you opened a door you wo n't be able to close , " he said , clad in black clothing with his face blurred			0
following the october attack , the government ordered the evacuation of houses along the @entity13 - @entity187 border , creating a one - kilometer - wide buffer zone , in a bid to curtail smuggling of arms through the @entity187 tunnels			1
in a video showcasing its capabilities under the banner of " a fierce military operation to purge @entity39 from the grip of terrorism and criminals " , @entity13 's army also included interviews with evacuees assuring the public that they did so willingly and received proper compensations			1
the residents of northern @entity6 have long complained of being neglected by @entity207			2
the lack of job opportunities and development -- along with a general mistrust between @entity213 peoples and the government -- has created fertile ground for the rise of @entity15			2
" this is collective punishment by the army and the police , " said @entity217 , a counter-terrorism researcher at the @entity219			2
" the army has been destroying houses of the people and burning their cars and motorcycles for the past two years			2
" terrorist attacks have only increased as the government has stepped up operations since july 2013 , observed @entity217 , who argues that the that the narrow focus on security is counterproductive and is only making the situation worse			0
" it 's very complicated			0
it has a lot of dimensions , economic and political			0
we are dealing with a regime that since july 2013 has been saying ' it 's me and only me , no parliament or elections , ' " said @entity217			0
opening the public sphere for competing viewpoints , he argued , would help curb terrorism			0
but defeating @entity15 will take more than establishing security			2
@entity217 says the government first needs to improve the lives of the civilians in the area			0
in the meantime , @entity15 is no longer confined to @entity6			1
it has launched attacks in the @entity253 , in @entity207 , and against @entity44 -- the group 's original enemy			0
in @entity207 , observers worry that the heavy hand of security services in cracking down on dissent is fueling the violence			0
it provides grounds for recruitment for groups like @entity15 and is reflected in the spike in number of improvised explosive devices ( @entity267 ) defused or detonated in the @entity268			1
@entity15 has only claimed responsibility for a few of these attacks			2
but despite the rise in number and sophistication of attacks , @entity217 believes @entity13 is safe for tourists and civilians -- at least for now			2
" now , @entity15 is not targeting civilians , " he told @entity90			0
" but if it gets worse and they do n't see hope , then maybe			0
" the government sees the threat within a regional context			0
@entity13 president @entity285 has expressed support for the global war on @entity22			1
and at home , he remains resolute			0
" they assume that we are incapable of confronting them			0
we were very careful that no blood is shed			0
but unfortunately , they wanted the exact opposite , " the former defense minister , elected president last summer , said 10 days after the october attack			0
@entity285 said he was n't shaken by the attack -- and refused to direct his anger at military leadership , as some voices critical of security failures have called for			0
he ridiculed @entity15 's attempts to create an " emirate " out of @entity6 , pledging that no one would crack the enduring unity of @entity13			1
it 's impossible for @entity15 to eliminate the @entity311 world 's largest military			1
yet until there is a victor , the death toll will continue to rise			0
as the group declared in one video , it seems more determined than ever to expand : " we will eliminate borders			0
no passports , no visas and no borders			0
it 's not just about @entity6			1
