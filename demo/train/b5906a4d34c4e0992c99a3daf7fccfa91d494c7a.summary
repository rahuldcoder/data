-- as the new @entity4 government of @entity5 unleashes a new round of stimulus for the ailing economy , a @entity2 restaurateur has thrown his support behind the new government -- but it comes with a resigned sigh that seems to mark most leadership changes in the world 's third largest economy			1
" i voted for @entity5 and the @entity21 , " says @entity15 , chef and owner of @entity17 , a restaurant that specializes in @entity20 food			1
" i decided to give them another chance			0
i give these guys a last chance			0
" @entity4 starts the new year under its seventh prime minister in seven years and a return to power for @entity5 's @entity21			1
the list of challenges for @entity5 -- who was previously prime minister in 2006 - 2007 -- is long and familiar : deflation , the strong yen , an aging population and an expensive country in which to live			1
all of this existed well before the damage from the tsunami , earthquake and nuclear disaster in march 2011			0
@entity42 : @entity4 unveils $ 117 billion stimulus package during the recent campaign , @entity5 promised more stimulus spending even though @entity4 's debt to gdp ratio is estimated at 236 % , according to recent @entity49 projections			1
that 's the highest debt level in the developed world			2
on friday , he made good on that promise as the government unveiled a $ 117 billion fiscal stimulus package in a bid to boost growth			1
" @entity64 " is the nickname given to the prime minister 's push for more quantitative easing from the @entity61 and a doubling of the inflation rate to 2 %			1
" @entity64 is not just about the central bank			0
it is about coordinating policy which is something here in @entity4 we have not had in basically five or six years , " @entity66 , head of @entity67 at @entity68 , tells @entity0			1
@entity66 says the acceleration of both fiscal and monetary policy is key			2
" that 's where the good news is going to be coming from in @entity4 the next six to nine months			1
" read more : waiting for @entity4 's election : could the ' @entity5 trade ' be justified ? but @entity81 , @entity82 , says more stimulus is not as simple as it sounds			1
" that 's the trick question			2
if you print a lot more money , you 're more likely to have inflation than deflation			0
on the positive side , quantitative easing can reduce deflation , " he said			0
" but if you have inflation come back , the investors ( in @entity4 government bonds ) are not going to be happy with 2 % inflation because the net return will be negative 1 %			1
so they ( @entity5 ) can not overdo it			1
" restaurant owner @entity15 and his brother - in - law -- @entity99 , the ceo of @entity100 , a real estate development company -- will watch the political leadership with a wary eye			0

corporate tax is 40 % which drives many foreign businesses out			0
he says the government needs to offer more incentives for companies to stay in @entity4			1
his own development company is getting creative by moving away from traditional business models			0
@entity100 is talking to @entity4 universities about leasing their land , building dormitories and managing them			1
" we 're trying to stay away from buying land and we 're borrowing land instead , " @entity99 says			0
he believes @entity4 's complex rules make leasing a better option			1
" it 's economically more viable because yields and returns are so much better if you do n't have to buy the land			2
we 're trying to create a new real estate asset class			0
" @entity15 's restaurant is casual and the average lunch costs $ 10			2
" we do n't feel the economy slowing down because business is constant			2
for me and a lot of my restaurant friends , turnover is not bad			0
" but he keeps his eye on the cost of electricity			0
since the nuclear crisis at @entity146 , the cost of power has increased			0
@entity15 now has to pay $ 600 more per month at his two restaurant locations			2
he 's also watching the yen which has weakened significantly since @entity5 called for more stimulus in november			1
while a weaker yen helps exporters by making their products cheaper overseas , it can have an adverse affect on businesses like restaurants and supermarkets that need to buy imports			0
" it depends how long the yen weakening lasts			0
a lot of food stuff is imported from outside , " says @entity15			0
" there 's always a time lag			2
if this ( weakening yen ) continues , it 'll affect a lot of people			0
