-- horrific events , such as the massacre in @entity3 , can be catalysts for social and political change			1
sometimes it seems that they 're the only catalyst ; recall how drastically our policies toward terrorism changed after 9/11 despite how moribund they were before			1
the problem is that fear can cloud our reasoning , causing us to overreact and to overly focus on the specifics			0
and the key is to steer our desire for change in that time of fear			0
our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis			1
we tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange and rare events , and downplay ordinary , familiar and common ones			1
we think rare risks are more common than they are			1
we fear them more than probability indicates we should			0
there is a lot of psychological research that tries to explain this , but one of the key findings is this : people tend to base risk analysis more on stories than on data			1
stories engage us at a much more visceral level , especially stories that are vivid , exciting or personally involving			0
when it 's not ' only a movie ' if a friend tells you about getting mugged in a foreign country , that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel traveling to that country than reading a page of abstract crime statistics will			0
novelty plus dread plus a good story equals overreaction			2
and who are the major storytellers these days ? television and the @entity55			0
so when news programs and sites endlessly repeat the story from @entity3 , with interviews with those in the theater , interviews with the families and commentary by anyone who has a point to make , we start to think this is something to fear , rather than a rare event that almost never happens and is n't worth worrying about			2
in other words , reading five stories about the same event feels somewhat like five separate events , and that skews our perceptions			2
we see the effects of this all the time			0
it 's strangers by whom we fear being murdered , kidnapped , raped and assaulted , when it 's far more likely that any perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend			0
we worry about airplane crashes and rampaging shooters instead of automobile crashes and domestic violence -- both of which are far more common and far , far more deadly			0
our greatest recent overreaction to a rare event was our response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11			2
i remember then - attorney general @entity94 giving a speech in @entity96 -- where i live -- in 2003 in which he claimed that the fact there were no new terrorist attacks since 9/11 was proof that his policies were working			1
i remember thinking : " there were no terrorist attacks in the two years preceding 9/11 , and you did n't have any policies			1
what does that prove ? " what it proves is that terrorist attacks are very rare , and perhaps our national response was n't worth the enormous expense , loss of liberty , attacks on our @entity116 and damage to our credibility on the world stage			1
still , overreacting was the natural thing for us to do			0
yes , it was security theater and not real security , but it made many of us feel safer			0
the rarity of events such as the @entity3 massacre does n't mean we should ignore any lessons it might teach us			1
because people overreact to rare events , they 're useful catalysts for social introspection and policy change			1
the key here is to focus not on the details of the particular event but on the broader issues common to all similar events			2
opinion : average @entity143 do n't need assault weapons installing metal detectors at movie theaters does n't make sense -- there 's no reason to think the next crazy gunman will choose a movie theater as his venue , and how effectively would a metal detector deter a lone gunman anyway ? -- but understanding the reasons why the @entity143 has so many gun deaths compared with other countries does			1
the particular motivations of alleged killer @entity159 are n't relevant -- the next gunman will have different motivations -- but the general state of mental health care in the @entity143 is			2
even with this , the most important lesson of the @entity3 massacre is how rare these events actually are			2
our brains are primed to believe that movie theaters are more dangerous than they used to be , but they 're not			0
the riskiest part of the evening is still the car ride to and from the movie theater , and even that 's very safe			0
but wear a seat belt all the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178			1

@entity178 : when horrific events happen , we look for lessons
he says people are n't good about understanding probabilities and often exaggerate risks
@entity178 : after 9/11 , policies were *adopted* that caused enormous expense and damage
he says lessons can be learned if we look at *patterns* among many events
