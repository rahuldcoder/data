@entity0 , a 31 - year - old mother of three , is facing a mandatory 20 years behind bars			1
she had pinned her hopes for freedom on a motion for a new trial ; that motion was denied thursday in a @entity8 courtroom			2
in late april , @entity9 spoke to @entity10 as an inmate in the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity8			1
" this is my life i 'm fighting for , " she said while wiping away tears			2
" if you do everything to get on the right side of the law , and it is a law that does not apply to you , where do you go from there ? " @entity9 is referring to @entity8 's " stand your ground " law , a law that has come under scrutiny since the killing of @entity24			1
unlike the @entity24 case , which involved one stranger killing another , @entity9 's case involved her gun and her abusive husband			1
on august 1 , 2010 , she said her husband , @entity32 , read text messages on her phone that she had written to her ex-husband			2
she said @entity32 became enraged and accused her of being unfaithful			0
" that 's when he strangled me			0
he put his hands around my neck , " @entity9 said			1
she managed to escape his grip but instead of running out the front door , she ran into the garage , she said , to get into her truck and drive away			0
@entity9 said that in the confusion of the fight , she forgot to get her keys and the garage door would n't open , so she made a fateful decision			1
" i knew i had to protect myself , " she said			0
" i could not fight him			0
he was 100 pounds more than me			0
i grabbed my weapon at that point			1
" she went back inside the house , and when @entity32 saw her pistol at her side , she said he threatened to kill her , so she raised the gun and fired one shot			1
" i believe when he threatened to kill me , that 's what he was absolutely going to do			2
that 's what he intended to do			0
had i not discharged my weapon at that point , i would not be here			1
" @entity9 , however , said she did not aim the gun at her husband			1
she said she fired into the air intending to scare him away , and @entity32 quickly left the house with his two children			1
no one was hurt in the incident , but @entity9 sits in jail facing a 20 - year sentence on three charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon			1
@entity32 admitted to a history of physical abuse			0
in a previous incident , @entity9 said he beat her so severely she ended up in the hospital and he ended up in jail			1
" he pushed me , choked me , pushed me so hard into the closet that i hit my head against the wall and passed out for a second , " @entity9 said			1
in a deposition for the case against @entity9 , @entity32 backed up much of his wife 's story			1
" i told her if she ever cheated on me , i would kill her , " he said during the proceeding led by a prosecutor for state attorney @entity93 's office and his wife 's defense attorney			0
" if my kids were n't there , i knew i probably would have tried to take the gun from her , " @entity32 said			2
" if my kids would n't have been there , i probably would have put my hand on her			0
" when @entity9 's defense attorney asked him what he meant by " put my hand on her , " @entity32 replied , " probably hit her			1
i got five baby mammas and i put my hands on every last one of them except for one			0
" @entity9 's attorney filed a motion for dismissal under the stand your ground law , but at that proceeding her husband changed his story			1
@entity32 said he lied during his deposition after conspiring with his wife in an effort to protect her			0
at the hearing , he denied threatening to kill his wife , adding , " i begged and pleaded for my life when she had the gun			2
" the motion was denied by the judge			0
@entity9 was offered a plea deal by @entity130 's office , but she opted to go to trial			1
a jury found @entity9 guilty in 12 minutes			1
she is baffled why invoking the stand your ground law was n't successful in her case			1
" other defendants have used it			0
what 's so different about my situation that it does n't apply to me , " she asked			0
the local @entity141 believes race may have played a role			0
" there 's a double standard with stand your ground , " said @entity144 , president of the @entity13 chapter of the @entity141			2
" the law is applied differently between african - americans and whites who are involved in these types of cases , " he said			2
@entity144 cited two cases in @entity8 with white shooters : one had a successful stand your ground defense and the other has yet to be charged with a crime			2
online blogs are also raising the question of race			0
last week , a spokeswoman for the rev. @entity163 confirmed he , too , was looking into @entity9 's story			2
when asked about race as a factor in her case , @entity9 declined to comment			1
@entity10 requested an interview with @entity32 for this story			0
he agreed but later declined through a family friend , saying he was concerned that speaking publicly would put his life in danger			0
on sunday , he resumed contact with @entity10 , offering an interview to " anyone who would like to pay			0
" monetary compensation for an interview is against @entity10 policy			0
thursday , after the motion for a new trial was denied , state attorney @entity93 told @entity10 affiliate @entity182 , " ( we ) offered to take 17 years off of the 20 - year mandatory ... i exercised that discretion and as late as the friday before trial , before we were picking a jury on the following monday , my two prosecutors were willing to let her take the three - year minimum mandatory , " she said			2
" the internet is filled with contentions that she fired a warning shot as she was being choked			2
nothing could be further from the truth			0
" @entity9 's sentencing hearing is scheduled for next friday , but the proceeding is a formality -- the judge has no discretion because her 20 - year sentence is mandatory			1
her attorney , @entity200 , tells @entity10 he will continue his client 's fight on appeal .			0

@entity0 fired a gun in the air when her abusive husband threatened her
no one was hurt , but she faces 20 years in prison on various charges
@entity9 : " had i not discharged my weapon at that point , i would not be here "
she hopes the case will be dismissed under the ' stand your ground ' law
