@entity0 , @entity1 -- director @entity4 must return to the @entity5 before the court will decide if he must go to prison for a 1977 sex conviction , a @entity0 judge ruled friday			1
@entity4 's lawyer argued that evidence of misconduct by the judge and prosecutor in the case 32 years ago should be considered now , without requiring @entity4 to be present			2
the famed director of " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a 13 - year - old girl in 1977 but fled to @entity20 before he was sentenced			1
he has been the subject of an international extradition battle since he was arrested in @entity23 in september on a @entity5 fugitive warrant			1
at a hearing friday afternoon , @entity26 judge @entity25 also rejected a request from @entity4 's victim -- @entity30 , now in her 40s and a married mother of three -- to have the case dismissed			2
@entity36 came forward long ago , saying she was disturbed by how the criminal case has been handled			0
" there is no requirement that my client surrender , " @entity38 , @entity36 's lawyer , said			0
" her suffering must come to an end			0
" @entity38 argued that " @entity45 's law , " an initiative passed by @entity1 voters in 2008 giving crime victims certain rights , had been violated by the prosecution			0
@entity38 said @entity36 was not consulted about the decision to extradite @entity4			0
@entity52 said the law was " never intended in this fashion			0
" @entity4 was 43 at the time of the conviction			0
prosecutors dropped rape and other charges in exchange for the guilty plea			2
@entity4 's attorney @entity62 argued that his client had already been sentenced in 1977 when the judge sent him to @entity1 's @entity65 for 45 days to be evaluated by psychologists			1
but @entity4 fled the country before sentencing after learning the judge might not go along with the short jail term @entity4 expected to get in exchange for his plea			1
he has been a fugitive since 1978 and lived in @entity71 before his arrest			2
" mr. @entity4 did not flee from justice , " @entity73 said			0
" he left because a corrupt judge was going to sentence him a second time			1
" in the past , @entity52 acknowledged problems with the way @entity4 's case was handled , mentioning a documentary film that portrays backroom deals between prosecutors and a media - obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send @entity4 to prison			1
" it 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " @entity52 said at an earlier hearing			0
on friday , @entity52 said " nothing in the order precludes the possibility that the judge 's promise will not some day be enforced			2
" deputy district attorney @entity96 argued the only just solution would be for @entity4 to waive extradition and return to the @entity5			1
" it 's mr. @entity4 's decision that has delayed the proceedings of this court , " @entity96 said			2
" why will he not simply surrender to this court 's jurisdiction ? " @entity104 , a retired @entity0 prosecutor , was featured in the documentary , " @entity4 : wanted and @entity106			0
" although he had never been assigned to handle the @entity4 case , @entity104 said he goaded the judge			0
he later recanted during an interview with @entity2 , saying he had inflated his importance in the celebrity case because he did n't think the documentary would be shown in the @entity5			1
it was broadcast in 2008 on @entity114 , which , like @entity2 , is part of @entity116			0
for years , @entity4 , 76 , and various lawyers have made quiet overtures to resolve the case , but negotiations have always gotten bogged down over prosecutors ' insistence that he return to the @entity5 and appear in a @entity0 courtroom			1
@entity23 authorities released the director from jail on $ 4.5 million bail in early december " pending extradition " to the @entity5 .			1
