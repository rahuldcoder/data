@entity0 -- it 's august , the dog days of summer , and president @entity4 and @entity5 are making a break from the nation 's capital			1
the president heads @entity10 for a quick trip on the economy that includes a visit with @entity14 , while federal lawmakers begin their five - week summer recess			1
@entity17 , a couple men who might have hopes of being the next @entity21 presidential nominee , and a first - term congressman from @entity23 also will be political stories in the week ahead			1
taking it to the states while lawmakers may have left @entity0 for the sticky month of august , their political battles are n't taking a rest			0
the sniping over @entity32 , immigration and the budget is only set to amplify as outside groups hit states to rally supporters behind their causes			2
like august 2009 , when rowdy town halls across the country helped fuel the burgeoning tea party movement , health care will provide conservative activists with a rallying cry for smaller government and less federal spending -- though this time around , @entity32 supporters are also getting into the town hall business			1
@entity32 battle heads to states @entity50 , the advocacy group formed from the remnants of @entity4 's presidential campaign , will get started sunday with community events and house parties pegged to the president 's 52nd birthday			1
the @entity32 rallies , part of the group 's " @entity61 " initiative , are designed to counter conservatives who are also darting across the country to push against the president 's sweeping health care law			1
while the 2009 rallies loudly pushed elected officials to reject the president 's plans , conservative events this year will advocate defunding the law , which was enacted in 2010 and deemed constitutional last summer by the @entity72			2
some conservative lawmakers -- including sen. @entity74 of @entity75 , rep. @entity76 of @entity77 and sen. @entity78 of @entity79 -- are using impending budget battles as leverage , vowing to oppose any measure that provides funding for the federal government that includes funding for the health care law			1
the measure funding the government expires september 30 , setting up another @entity90 budget battle between @entity21 and the @entity91			0
other republicans , however , have voiced opposition to threatening a government shutdown in order to gut the health care law			0
@entity97 's juggling act : killing @entity32 and avoiding shutdown other groups hitting the road : the @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 ; and the @entity104 and protect your care			2
@entity4 heads @entity10 with economic speeches in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity77 and @entity110 under his belt , @entity4 heads west tuesday to @entity112 , this time to talk housing in a market that 's seeing recovery after home prices plummeted			1
@entity117 was one of the worst hit areas during the housing crisis , seeing home prices drop more than 50 % between 2006 and 2011			1
but things are looking up -- a closely watched index out this week showed home prices there were up more than 20 % from a year ago			0
@entity126 : home prices keep soaring but homeownership around the nation is still at record lows , and according to a report this week from a federal watchdog , borrowers who received help through the government 's main foreclosure prevention program are re-defaulting on their mortgages at alarming rates			0
" in @entity112 , the president will lay out his plan to continue to help responsible homeowners and those @entity143 who seek to own their own homes as another cornerstone of how we can strengthen the middle class in @entity143 , " @entity91 press secretary @entity139 said this week			0
the speech is a continuation of the president 's push to turn back to the economy and jobs , which @entity143 still rate as their top issues in public polling			0
@entity21 have largely been skeptical of the new effort , casting it as yet another " pivot " that has n't resulted in any new proposals			0
while out @entity10 , the president will also drop in on @entity14 , taping an appearance on " @entity163 " on tuesday			1
he 'll also visit servicemen and women at southern @entity167 's @entity166			0
he 's back ! @entity17 is attending his first political fundraiser since he lost last november 's presidential election			1
the former @entity171 governor and 2012 @entity21 nominee will be the headliner at a @entity175 @entity21 reception and fundraiser			1
the event will take place on tuesday in the @entity175 's lakes region , near @entity17 's vacation home in @entity181 , along @entity182			1
the @entity175 @entity21 told @entity1 that general admission tickets for the event are sold out			2
" the dinner will give @entity17 's many local supporters in @entity175 a chance to see him again , " @entity185 , an adviser to the @entity175 @entity21 who worked on the @entity17 campaign , told @entity1			1
was @entity17 right about @entity191 and @entity192 ? following november 's election loss , @entity17 spent much of his time out of the public eye , but he recently re-entered the spotlight , holding a multiday conference in @entity198 , @entity79 , that featured several prospective 2016 presidential candidates and other national leaders , as well as some of the @entity21 's major donors			2
is the next race already under way ? two men who might aspire to be the @entity21 presidential nominee in 2016 head to -- you guessed it -- @entity210 at the end of the week			2
former sen. @entity212 of @entity213 , who battled @entity17 deep into last year 's @entity21 primaries , and freshman sen. @entity74 will have prominent speaking roles at the @entity216			1
the event 's being put on by the @entity219 , a group that 's influential with social conservatives in @entity210			1
social conservative voters are a key constituency among @entity223 , and @entity210 's caucuses lead off the presidential primary and caucus calendar			2
@entity212 is well known and respected among social conservatives			2
@entity74 , who was elected to the @entity227 last year thanks to strong support from tea party and other grassroots conservatives , is fast becoming a rising star on the right			2
also speaking at the gathering : @entity234 , who once again might be flirting with running for president			0
game on in crucial @entity227 battle get ready for what could be another crucial and bruising 2014 @entity227 battle , this time in @entity23 , which could ultimately decide whether the @entity240 keep control of the chamber			0
@entity21 rep. @entity243 is expected to announce tuesday that he 's running against incumbent two - term @entity143 sen. @entity244 , who is considered one of the most vulnerable @entity240 senators up for re-election next year			0
@entity243 , who served in the wars in @entity249 and @entity250 , is considered a rising star in the @entity21 and is a favorite of many neoconservatives			0
the representative , who was just elected to @entity5 this past november , has been a frequent guest on cable news channels , including @entity1			0
next year the @entity240 will try to maintain their majority in the @entity227 , where they hold a 54 - 46 edge ( including two independents who caucus with the party ) over the @entity21			0
they hope to expand that to 55 - 45 following october 's special @entity227 election in @entity262 , which they are favored to win			0
but they most likely will be defending 21 of 35 seats up for grabs in november 2014 .			0
