-- @entity1 just made it a little bit harder to be a troll			1
in the wake of reports about death and rape threats as well as other abuse targeting women as part of the so - called @entity13 movement , @entity1 announced tuesday that it has improved its reporting and blocking features			1
the changes , @entity1 said in a blog post , will make it easier to police , and respond to , bad behavior among its roughly 284 million active users			2
particularly on mobile , abuse will be easier to report , requiring less information and simplifying the way a user flags accounts or specific tweets for review			2
it also will become easier for users to report abuse that they see but were not the targets of themselves			0
survey : 40 % of web users have been harassed the blog post also says @entity1 has improved its " behind the scenes " procedures to make reviewing and responding to abuse reports faster			1
unlike @entity39 , which requires that users create accounts using their real names , @entity1 allows anonymity			0
that 's why @entity1 is sometimes the forum preferred by people who want to harass others			0
the service has at times come under fire for not doing enough to clamp down on such abuse			0
in the past few months , @entity13 has been the driving force behind a new wave of nasty , and widely reported , abuse on the site			1
ostensibly an effort to improve ethical standards in video - game journalism , it quickly devolved into ugliness , with @entity61 users identifying themselves with the movement targeting female game developers and journalists online .			0

@entity1 has improved tools for reporting abuse
easier mobile reporting among is among the changes
the move comes after wave of @entity13 harassment
