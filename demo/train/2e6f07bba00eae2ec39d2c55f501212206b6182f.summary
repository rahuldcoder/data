-- a man in @entity2 walks into an outpatient clinic for his daughter to receive an electrocardiogram and sonogram			2
he later receives a bill for a " facility fee " of $ 5,000 that his insurance will not cover			2
a new resident in @entity13 looks for a primary care doctor but must wait 3 weeks for an appointment to get refills on medication			2
a 25 - week pregnant woman who works two part - time minimum wage jobs can not afford the $ 50 co-pay for regular visits or the $ 200 in prenatal vitamins her doctor recommends			0
when her labor begins , she goes to the emergency room where her baby is delivered			0
do any of these stories sound familiar ? probably			0
the @entity29 health care system ranks dead last among 11 peer nations for overall quality and costs			1
according to @entity35 's latest findings , we have the least efficient , least fair and worst health outcomes among the nations surveyed			1
@entity29 have the highest death rate , the highest infant death rate and worst health at age 60			1
yet @entity29 pay more than double what people in these other nations pay			1
it sounds bad , and it is			0
let 's try to look at it another way			2
imagine you and someone from the town nearby are each going out for dinner			0
you have to go to restaurant a. there , you can only be seated if you have paid a membership fee			0
you receive a menu with no prices or descriptions of the meal and are served food you did n't expect and that is barely warm			0
but the decor is nice and the restaurant has fun commercials on television			0
your neighbor has to go to restaurant @entity68 , the menu items are described clearly			0
he can see the prices , and the food that arrives at the table looks like what he ordered			0
the decor is n't much to write home about , and there are n't any commercials			0
when restaurant a is all you know , then , well , it is what 's for dinner			2
but when you learn about restaurant b -- and how your neighbor pays less for more -- suddenly that cold meatloaf from restaurant a does n't cut it			0
no one would tolerate such a terrible dining experience at restaurant a , especially not when a perfectly good meal is to be had across town at restaurant @entity93 in the @entity29 , our experience as health care consumers is a lot like dining at restaurant a -- a business that under normal market conditions would likely be closed within a week			1
the membership fee required for entry is your paid insurance premium			0
the menu with no prices is your treatment plan			0
health care services are offered and rendered by providers without any real discussion of cost either to the health care facility or the customer			1
you agree -- because you need the medical care , and when the bill arrives later you learn it costs far more than you expected , even if you used insurance			2
sadly , the @entity29 health care system has been consistently low in ratings			1
@entity35 ranked the @entity29 last in 2010 , 2007 , 2006 and 2004			1
and consumers know how bad things are			0
the 2013 @entity121 survey found that 55 % of @entity29 rank @entity29 health care as either " poor " or " fair			1
" what should surprise all of us is our willingness to tolerate such a broken industry			1
we do not usually buy products or use services for the lowest quality for double the price			2
unless , of course , there is a reason			0
some would argue that health care is a service that is unlike any other in our economy			1
we purchase health care often unwillingly , or at times of great stress and medical concern			1
there is a huge gap in knowledge and power between doctors and nurses and patients			0
there is an almost total lack of transparency about cost , quality and outcomes among various insurance providers for different kinds of procedures or between health care facilities			1
and to add insult to injury , there is no restaurant b at which we can dine			0
unless we move to @entity162			0
previously , the @entity29 differs the most from peer countries for its absence of universal health insurance coverage			1
now that the @entity167 requires everyone in the @entity29 to purchase health insurance , will our problems be solved ? hardly			1
the @entity167 has made the @entity29 a little more like @entity170 and @entity162 , but requiring citizens to purchase health insurance will not be the silver bullet for our health care woes			1
@entity175 and @entity176 have universal health insurance coverage and still rank 9th and 10th			2
what we must do is demystify the process of buying health care in the @entity29			1
@entity181 and accurate quality standards , price transparency , and more easily accessible outcome information are essential to allow consumers to make better choices			1
the @entity187 and the @entity189 's @entity188 are great examples , but we need more things like that			2
the @entity29 can learn from what other countries have done right			2
our government , hospitals , doctors , insurance companies and consumers can change our abysmal health care system if we put our mind to it			1
because no one wants to eat an overpriced meal at a bad restaurant night after night , year after year .			0
