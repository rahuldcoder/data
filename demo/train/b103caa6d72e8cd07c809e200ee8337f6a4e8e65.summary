-- the past few weeks have seen @entity1 become increasingly belligerent toward the @entity2 and @entity3 , with @entity4 threatening to " mercilessly strike " its enemies			1
but does the reclusive nation , led by @entity6 , have the capability to back up its threats ? realistically , who 's at risk of attack and where ? most observers say @entity1 is years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead			0
however , it still has plenty of conventional firepower , including medium - range missiles			0
@entity1 : our global fear and fascination here 's a look at some of @entity1 's possible targets and whether they might be in range : @entity3 the two @entity27 technically are still at war because their conflict in the 1950s ended in a truce , not a peace treaty			1
but in march , the @entity1 declared that truce invalid			0
@entity3 's close proximity to the north puts it easily within range of the @entity1 's missiles -- not to mention the heavy artillery that 's built up at the @entity38 separating the two countries			2
the @entity1 also has a military force of 1.1 million -- nearly double the @entity3 military and the 28,000 @entity2 troops stationed in the @entity3			1
its numbers advantage offsets an aging air force , which has suffered fuel shortages in the past , and a navy that 's smaller than @entity3 's			0
people in @entity3 's capital do n't seem too concerned with the @entity1 's latest rhetoric -- they 've been hearing it for decades			2
but it 's different on @entity52 , a two - hour ferry trip from the @entity3 mainland , where people have fresh memories of @entity1 's shelling in 2010			2
@entity57 in addition to @entity3 , @entity1 has threatened to strike @entity2 bases in the @entity60 , specifically those in @entity61 and @entity57			1
the @entity2 recently announced that it would be sending a land - based missile defense system to @entity57 , an island in the @entity60 about 2,000 miles from @entity1 , to defend against a possible attack			1
@entity1 says @entity2 bases in @entity57 are in " striking range , " but at least one analyst says he 's doubtful of a legitimate threat			1
" unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among @entity1 's strategic forces , there is little chance that it could successfully land a missile on @entity57 , @entity61 or anywhere else outside the @entity80 that @entity2 forces may be stationed , " wrote @entity69 , @entity70 editor of @entity71 , in an opinion column for @entity0			1
still , the @entity2 is taking no chances			0
" it only takes being wrong once , and i do n't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once , " @entity2 defense secretary @entity83 said			0
@entity85 while there may be some doubt about whether @entity1 could strike @entity57 , the same can not be said for @entity85			1
only a few hundred miles separate @entity1 and @entity85 , which also hosts @entity2 military bases			1
with @entity1 allegedly transferring missile components to its east coast , @entity85 faces the threat of a missile hitting its shores or flying over its air			2
@entity96 state media in @entity1 reported in march that it had rockets on standby , ready to fire at @entity2 targets on the mainland			2
that report came with a photo of @entity6 featuring a map behind him that appeared to show straight lines stretching to the continental @entity2			0
officials have said they do not believe @entity1 has the capability to reach @entity61 , much less the @entity2 mainland			1
but the @entity108 administration nevertheless announced plans to deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity112			0
in a march interview with @entity114 , president @entity108 said he does not think @entity1 can carry out a missile attack on the @entity2			0
" they probably ca n't , but we do n't like the margin of error , " @entity108 said .			0

@entity1 has threatened *pre-emptive* strikes against @entity2 , but how realistic are these threats ?
@entity3 and @entity85 , both with @entity2 military bases , are well within striking *distance*
*experts* doubt @entity57 could be hit , and the @entity2 mainland appears to be well out of range
