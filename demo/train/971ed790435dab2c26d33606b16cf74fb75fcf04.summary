i 'm a sucker for all of those man - on - the - street interviews that late - night shows do to reveal just how dumb @entity3 are			1
it 's fun to laugh at the people who struggle with simple math problems or are unable to find any country we 're at war with on a map			1
more than a few even get tripped up trying to name the branches of government			0
it 's all fun and games until you remember that elections have consequences , and that many of those people who said they could name the president -- but not the commander in chief -- will soon be standing in a voting booth , armed with a ballot			2
if you think government dysfunction is the country 's no. 1 problem -- and according to a recent @entity31 poll , a third of the nation does -- then maybe we should take those hilarious late - night interviews a little more seriously			1
you see , while we were busy waving our angry finger at @entity36 , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) released its findings from the @entity38			2
the group 's research measured the literacy , math and computer skills of 5,000 adults from 16 to 65 and compared those numbers with that of 21 other countries			1
the good news is that we did n't finish last in anything			0
the bad news is that we 're in pretty sad shape when not finishing last is the good news			0
trailing every country in the survey except @entity54 and @entity55 in math is rough			2
but how the @entity33 's findings may play a role in elections and the economy is disturbing			1
according to the report , " individuals who score at lower levels of proficiency in literacy are more likely than those with higher proficiency to ... believe that they have little impact on the political process			2
" also " in most countries , individuals with lower proficiency are also more likely to have lower levels of trust in others			0
" @entity3 adults ranked 16th in literacy proficiency			1
the @entity33 findings seem to be consistent with that of the @entity3 @entity80 , which estimated back in 2009 that some 32 million adults lacked the proficiency to read a newspaper			1
this was captured by a witty @entity87 headline about the findings : " literacy study : 1 in 7 @entity3 are unable to read this story			1
" that was kinder than the @entity92 headline after the new @entity33 report : " @entity3 adults are dumber than the average human			1
" an uneducated workforce is a hindrance to us all and an uninformed electorate is the thorn in democracy 's side , taunting us with the words of @entity103 : " every country has the government it deserves			2
" while it seems there 's a chance we could be headed toward an agreement that will put an end to the partial government shutdown , we must not overlook the fact that the man most credited / blamed for the disruption was on the @entity116 floor quoting " @entity118 " during his filibuster			2
but this is not just a @entity121 problem			0
i ca n't help but notice the correlation between a more partisan nation and a more dumb - ass nation -- regardless of party			0
remember @entity127 is not the first politician to drag dr. @entity129 into the mess that is @entity36			1
in 2007 , during the immigration debate , sen. @entity131 read a piece from the @entity134 that contained quotes from " @entity136			0
" " and this mess is so big			0
and this mess is so deep and so tall , we can not pick it up			0
there is no way at all ! " @entity131 then went on to say : " mr. president , some would say that is what we have in the @entity116 today -- a big mess			0
but if you go back and read dr. @entity129 , the cat manages to clean up the mess			1
" i used to think politicians such as @entity127 and @entity131 quoted from children 's books as a way to insult the intelligence of their political foes			2
now i 'm wondering if it 's because they 're afraid using big words would lose the rest of us			0
when @entity31 asked @entity3 what was the country 's top problem , after dysfunctional government , the top - listed items were the economy ( 19 % ) , unemployment ( 12 % ) , the deficit ( 12 % ) and health care ( 12 % )			1
sadly education did n't crack the top five , despite being the one area that really links them all			0
" proficiency in literacy , numeracy and problem solving in technology rich environments is positively and independently associated with the probability of participating in the labour market and being employed , and with higher wages , " the new @entity33 report stated			1
educators will tell you the best catalyst for prolonged academic success is early childhood education			0
among the 38 @entity33 and @entity189 countries that participated in a report released last year , we were 28th in the percentage of 4 - year - olds who are receiving early childhood education			1
hmmm , those late - night interviews are n't so funny anymore .			0

@entity196 cites recent @entity33 report showing @entity3 ranking low on skills
he says lack of literacy , math skills provides a *sobering* take on @entity3 democracy
think how many voters are ill - informed and poorly *equipped* to make *smart* choices , he says
@entity210 : it 's no wonder politicians are reading dr. @entity129 aloud on the floor of @entity214
