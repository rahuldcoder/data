@entity1 an emotional @entity0 announced his resignation as governor of @entity5 on friday , acknowledging he had " become a liability " to his state but asserting his innocence of any wrongdoing in a scandal surrounding his fiancee 's consulting and policy work			1
" i have always had the deepest respect for the remarkable institution that is the @entity16 ; and for the office of the governor , " @entity0 said in a recorded message			1
" and i can not in good conscience continue to be the element that undermines it			0
i have always tried to do the right thing and now the right thing to do is to step aside			0
" the resignation will take effect next wednesday , at which point @entity28 secretary of state @entity27 will take over as governor			2
@entity31 , the nation 's largest lgbt rights organization , trumpeted her promotion friday as the ascension of the nation 's first openly bisexual governor			0
@entity0 's decision to step down came as little surprise , as he had faced mounting calls to resign this week over reports indicating his finacee , @entity42 , advised the governor and state employees on energy policy while getting paid by a group advocating on the issue			1
the state attorney general opened a criminal investigation into the case on monday , and on thursday night , state troopers gathered outside his @entity53 - area home , leaving after a fruitless hours - long stakeout with no sighting of the governor			1
the resignation came as the @entity58 served criminal subpoenas on @entity0 and @entity42			1
the subpoenas seek emails , letters and financial information concerning a wide range of activities , including state business			2
@entity0 said friday , however , " i am confident that i have not broken any laws nor taken any actions that were dishonest or dishonorable in their intent or outcome , " and asserted that the @entity68 and ethics investigation into his fiancee 's work would ultimately exonerate him in the eyes of @entity73			1
but he also acknowledged that the questions dogging his administration over his fiancee 's policy work , " and the escalating media frenzy that has stemmed from this , has clearly reached the point of no return			0
" and , voice wavering , he expressed a love for @entity5 , " its people , its rivers , its mountains and its landscapes , with every fiber of my being			2
" it was a dramatic end for a governor that made @entity5 history just three months ago by winning an unprecedented fourth term in office			1

questions surrounding her role as an adviser to the governor , while still doing consulting work on the side , dogged them both during his 2010 reelection campaign			0

" love is blind â € ” that 's all i 'm going to say , " @entity5 @entity28 rep. @entity124 told @entity2 in @entity1 on friday			2
the reports that prompted @entity0 's resignation emerged before he was reelected , but @entity0 was largely able to ignore them , riding @entity5 's heavily @entity28 electorate and a flawed @entity133 challenger to victory last fall			1
but details surrounding the scandal continued to trickle out over the past few months , and the situation came to a head last week with the state 's largest paper , @entity141 , calling on him to resign			0
on monday , the @entity5 attorney general opened up an investigation into the situation			1
and @entity0 stoked the controversy this week by reportedly deciding to resign by tuesday , and in a move his secretary of state called " bizarre and unprecedented , " changing his mind by wednesday afternoon			1
@entity27 outlined her experience during the saga in a statement , saying she received a call from @entity0 late tuesday afternoon asking her to return to @entity5 from @entity1 " as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone			1
" when she returned , late wednesday afternoon , @entity27 said things had changed			0

" i asked him what he wanted to talk about			0
the governor told me he was not resigning , after which he began a discussion about transition			0
" @entity27 added : " this is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation			0
" she said she told the governor she and her staff would be ready if he resigns			2
and the call for him to do just that grew louder into thursday , with state treasurer @entity173 becoming the first @entity5 elected official to publicly call for @entity0 to step down			1
in a statement , @entity173 said the governor " has accomplished many great things during his long career , and history will be kinder to him than current events suggest			0
" " unfortunately , the current situation has become untenable , and i can not imagine any scenario by which things improve			0
@entity5 deserves a governor who is fully focused on the duties of state , " @entity173 said			1
on friday , the overarching consensus in @entity5 was that @entity0 had done the right thing , and that his resignation would , as sen. @entity189 put it in a statement , let the state " refocus " on its goals			1
. " @entity73 have a right to expect the highest ethical standards from their government , and today 's announcement by governor @entity0 acknowledges that reality , " the @entity28 senator said			1
" in the days ahead , we will refocus with our new governor @entity27 on the goal all @entity73 share - making the best state in @entity203 even better			2
