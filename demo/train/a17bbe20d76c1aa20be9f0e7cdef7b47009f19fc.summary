-- the attorney for a woman who accused @entity4 quarterback @entity3 of raping her called friday for a state inquiry into how authorities handled the now - closed investigation into her allegations			1
in a news conference friday , attorney @entity10 accused the @entity13 police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of @entity3			1
" i would characterize the investigation overall as an investigation into a rape victim as opposed to a rape suspect , " @entity19 said			0
she said more than half of the 248 - page investigative file authorities released to her consisted of records related to her client 's telephone , social media and other records			2
she said only 11 of the pages contain references to @entity3 , and said some of the files released by authorities differed from those obtained by the woman 's family			1
@entity19 also questioned how investigators handled and tested evidence in the case and said investigators failed to get warrants to examine video surveillance , @entity3 's apartment and other potential evidence that could have proven crucial to the case			1
" you have a rape kit , you have physical evidence , you have blood in the underwear , you have semen , you have marks and bruises , you have a sprained back , some scrapes on the feet , " @entity19 told reporters			0
" so you have injuries , identification , you have an immediate report ... and he ( the detective ) does n't issue probable cause to get a search warrant for mr. @entity3 's dna			2
instead , he issues a search warrant into the victim 's phone records , " she said			0
last week , @entity74 , the state attorney for the 2nd @entity75 , which includes @entity76 and @entity13 , announced he would not file charges against @entity3 , whom the woman accused of rape in december 2012			1
@entity74 ' decision followed a police investigation that the woman 's family has alleged included undue emphasis on @entity3 's role as a leading player on the nation 's top - ranked football team			1
he is also a finalist for the @entity88 , which honors the nation 's most outstanding college football athlete			0
at the time , @entity74 dismissed such criticisms , saying there was insufficient evidence even to arrest @entity3 , much less charge him with a crime			2
@entity3 has said through his attorney , @entity95 , that he had consensual sex with the woman			1
@entity19 said friday that what she called a botched investigation deserves attention from outside investigators " because if victims are subjected on an ongoing basis to what this victim has been subjected to , this is a serious problem in the state of @entity104			0
" @entity104 attorney general @entity111 has spoken with the head of the @entity113 about the possibility of an inquiry , but no formal request has been received , spokesman @entity110 told @entity0 on friday			1
@entity117 , the @entity118 's public information officer , said , " the case has been closed by the @entity120 , and the department continues to support him in all of his endeavors			0
" according to police documents , the woman told investigators she had been drinking with friends at a @entity13 bar called @entity130 's			2
she said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar			0
she said she did not remember much of what happened next but told investigators she remembered winding up in a ground - floor apartment , where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections			0
she reported the alleged assault to campus police that night			0
the woman came forward a month after making her initial report to accuse @entity3 , but @entity13 's interim police chief @entity147 said last week that she " broke off contact " with investigators in february and said she did n't want to go forward with the case			1
the woman 's family has said that a detective had warned her attorney that @entity13 is a " big football town " and that her life could be miserable if she pursued the case			1
@entity19 said the woman is not contemplating any civil litigation and is focusing on finishing final examinations at @entity4 under special accommodations made by the school			2
she said the woman 's sorority has been subjected to threats and has had some tires slashed			0
@entity0 's @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
