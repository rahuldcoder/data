when @entity1 played tennis , the grand slam winner and former world no. 1 never shied away from conversing , or arguing with chair umpires			1
the @entity6 famously blew up at the @entity7 in 2008 in a five - set loss to @entity9 , telling the crowd in @entity11 : " stay in school , kids , or you 'll end up being a chair umpire			0
" by no means was it the lone outburst of his career			0
having retired in 2012 and now watching the game as a pundit , @entity1 , perhaps unsurprisingly , says there is not enough interaction between players and umpires			1
his solution ? @entity1 would scrap @entity27 or severely alter the system currently in place			1
" this is completely different to what i thought as a player , but i would get rid of the challenge system , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity30 on the sidelines of the charity event @entity33 in december			1
" i feel like we 've lost a lot of our personality			0
if someone is really having a go at the umpire , you are not going to change the channel			0
" it 's about eyeballs on tv sets , " he said			0
the overwhelming majority of players currently on the tennis tour have welcomed the instant replay system , which was first introduced at a top - level tennis tournament late in 2005			1
by that time , @entity27 had already been used in cricket , with football 's @entity56 subsequently adopting @entity27 to help determine whether goals have been scored			1
@entity1 -- a big sports fan who touches on several sports in his role for @entity61 in the @entity6 -- is n't alone in his dislike of @entity27			1
@entity63 , the 17 - time grand slam champion who could be labeled a traditionalist , asked @entity27 to be switched off during the 2007 @entity68 final against arch - rival @entity69			1
and two years ago in @entity71 , the @entity70 told reporters : " what i like without @entity27 is just the players challenging the umpires more often			2
" he did add , though , that he got the " point " of @entity27			2
" we love our guys in the game now , @entity63 , @entity69 and the way they carry themselves but there 's some entertainment value on the guys that do n't carry themselves so well , " @entity1 said , mentioning himself , retired two - time grand slam winner @entity78 and the man dubbed ' @entity81 , ' @entity81			1
" @entity81 is out here all the time still going nuts and people love it , " said @entity1 , referring to the 55 - year - old @entity81 competing in seniors ' events			2
@entity94 , a former elite umpire who was in the chair for grand slam , @entity97 and @entity99 finals , did n't entirely disagree with @entity1			2
@entity94 officiated before @entity27 and then when it was implemented at tournaments			2
" i think @entity27 is a great addition to the game , because the fans love it , and at the end of the day , the players have a chance to make sure the calls are right , " @entity94 , the ceo and founding partner of sports management company @entity102 , told @entity0			2
" from an umpire 's point of view , this is very satisfying because the worst feeling you have in the chair is when you think you 've made a mistake and there 's nothing you can do about it			0
" but having said that , i see where @entity1 is coming from			0
it has taken away the discussion , the element of confrontation between the players and umpires , and that may be a sad thing of course for some fans -- but not necessarily for those in the chair			0
" if discontinuing @entity27 is too harsh , @entity1 suggested limiting the number of challenges in a match to one			1
the challenge would remain an option so long as the player is proved right when going to the instant replay			0
currently in matches where @entity27 is employed , players are allowed three incorrect challenges per set , plus one more in a tiebreak			0
another change in the game @entity1 would make is keeping play going when there are lets			1
for @entity1 , the entertainment factor is indeed key			1
" we are fooling ourselves if we do n't think sports are entertainment , " he said			0
" the first goal is winning and that 's where you have a job			0
i am not saying we parade around and go all @entity155 and enter the court in feather bows or anything , but if we play tennis with regular umpires forever and a day and it worked -- it was n't like it was broken at all			0

@entity1 says he would *abolish* or *significantly* alter the challenge system in tennis
@entity1 feels that some of the entertainment value is gone from tennis
@entity63 , considered a traditionalist , has never been a fan of @entity27
@entity1 also says he would do away with lets in tennis , with play continuing
