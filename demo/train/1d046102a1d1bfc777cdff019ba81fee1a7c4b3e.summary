@entity1 commissioner @entity0 acknowledged friday that " it 's been a tough year " for him and his league after months ' worth of news about everything from allegedly abusive players to ongoing concerns about concussions to deflated footballs			1
but it was also one , he insisted , marked by significant progress on several fronts			0
" we 've all done a lot of soul - searching , starting with yours truly , " @entity0 said			1
" and we have taken action			0
" the commissioner made these remarks during his " state of the league , " given each season on the eve of the @entity25			1
this sunday 's matchup is between the @entity27 and @entity28			2
the @entity1 is the most popular professional sport in the @entity30 , which makes the spotlight on it that much brighter			1
on friday , @entity0 touched on a number of subjects , from instant replay to extra points to a possible franchise in @entity38			1
but he could n't get away from issues that have dogged his office -- chief among them how the @entity1 handles allegations of domestic violence by players			1
@entity0 said the @entity1 was n't where it needed to be in august , when then - @entity48 running back @entity47 became the center of controversy after video surfaced showing him hitting his then - fianc√©e			1
this case came on top of several others -- from child abuse accusations against @entity57 running back @entity58 to an assault case against @entity61 defensive star @entity60 -- that had some demanding that the commissioner resign			0
he gave no indication friday he would do any such thing , even after what he called " a year of ... humility and learning			2
" " we obviously as an organization have gone through adversity , but more importantly it 's been adversity for me , " @entity0 said			1
" and that is something where we take that seriously			0
it 's an opportunity for us to get better			2
it 's an opportunity for us , for our organization , to get better			2
" for the first time , the commissioner also addressed what 's been dubbed @entity82 , which relates to the use of underinflated footballs in the first half of the @entity27 ' @entity87 win over the @entity88			0
as information leaked out about the situation , some suggested strict punishments for @entity27 -- from large fines to suspensions to kicking the team out of the @entity25			0
but the @entity27 have fired back , with coach @entity96 denying wrongdoing and suggesting science could explain the air pressure issue and owner @entity100 suggesting the @entity1 may owe @entity96 and @entity27 quarterback @entity101 an apology if its investigation finds no wrongdoing			2
what the heck is @entity107 anyway ? the commissioner made no apologies friday for the league 's handling of the case , saying , " this is my responsibility to protect the integrity of the game			1
" he 's tapped @entity116 to lead an external investigation into the issue			0
" i represent 32 teams , " he added			0
" ... and if we have any information where the potential is that those rules were violated , i have to pursue that , and i have to pursue that aggressively			0
" that investigation is focusing on two main questions , according to @entity0 : " why were some footballs used in the game that were not in compliance with the rules , and was this result of deliberate action ? " he added , " i want to emphasize -- we have made no judgments on these points			1
and we will not compromise the investigation by engaging in speculation			0

the @entity1 's @entity0 : " we 've done a lot of soul - searching , starting with yours truly "
the league has been *criticized* for its handling of domestic violence cases
