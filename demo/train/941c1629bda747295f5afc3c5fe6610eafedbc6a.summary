-- @entity1 have a special relationship with the sky			2
we know how to look up			2
on the prairies of western @entity7 , the skies are so big , and so full , it is easy to feel you may begin to fall upward , or even fly			1
to live underneath this unbroken expanse of heaven can be at once inspiring and terrifying			2
every okie has seen those skies turn scary , and every @entity14 accepts that atmospheric instability is a part of our legacy			1
in school and from our trusted local meteorologists , we learn from an early age what to look for in a sky , in a radar map and in a safe place			2
@entity27 - tinted clouds are never a good sign ; a hook echo on a radar -- the telltale swirl at the edge of a storm pattern indicating strong rotation -- means take cover			1
underground is best , in a basement or storm shelter			1
but a small , ground - floor room with no exterior walls will do if the tornado is n't too strong			2
cover up with a mattress or thick blanket to avoid debris ; do n't open all the windows in the house , contrary to now discredited advice ; do n't hide under an overpass			1
opinion : how can we be sage from tornadoes ? if this liturgy of weather preparedness is part of the @entity7 psyche , so , unfortunately , is devastation			1
fourteen years ago this month , one of the worst tornadoes in history roared through @entity60 , @entity7 , taking dozens of lives and hundreds of homes			1
long after the initial cleanup was completed , the disaster was everywhere apparent			1
the branches of trees were gnarled by the winds into unreal shapes , their leaves growing close to the bark as if for protection			2
neighborhoods that once were thick with homes seemed almost to revert to the fields from which they 'd sprung			0
for those who lost homes , it took months , sometimes years , to become whole			0
for those who lost loved ones , that never happened			0
that is why for the people of @entity60 , what happened on may 20 feels impossible			0
it is impossible that this happened here again			0
it is impossible to reduce the suffering to a number : lives lost , homes destroyed , damage expressed in dollars			0
for many , it must feel impossible to know where to begin to carry on			0
inside a tornado - ravaged school how does a community make sense of destruction on the level carried out by monday 's storm ? in @entity60 , it began almost as soon as the tornado touched down			1
teachers at @entity105 and @entity106 elementary schools threw their bodies over their students to protect them from debris			0
survivors flooded the streets helping to dig their neighbors out from under collapsed homes			1
trucks filled with supplies raced to the scene			0
that is how we begin			0
it 's what we know how to do			0
@entity121 just came from @entity122 @entity7 that @entity124 star forward @entity123 has donated $ 1 million to disaster relief efforts ; @entity126 , headquartered in @entity127 , donated $ 2.5 million			2
thousands more from all over the country have donated what they can			0
for @entity14 , this is what home is about			0
opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado the " @entity138 , " exhibited to the world after the 1995 bombing of the @entity141 in downtown @entity127 , after the may 3 , 1999 , tornado , and today , is who we are			1
what is on display before the world 's eyes is not only a community 's response to a disaster but an exhibition of something essential to the @entity7 character			2
we make sense of disaster by showing up and doing what we can			1
we find meaning in a bottle of water , a rescued pet , a family reunited , an act of selflessness			1
these things -- and not disasters -- are what define home for us			0
home , to borrow a phrase from the @entity168 , is where we live and move and have our being			0
it is not only where but who we are			0
@entity60 in bull 's - eye twice , now we may know why our identity is in softly rolling prairies giving way to forested hills , in long stretches of horizon that make you feel like you could see almost to eternity , and in big skies stretched tight above it all			1
we have learned to watch those skies -- for blessings , for rain , for sunshine , for wind and for signs of danger			1
and we have learned to help			0
it 's in our bones , like red dirt and big skies			1
it 's what we will do now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			1

@entity198 : okies love the big , full skies , but watch them closely for signs of *trouble*
@entity198 : @entity27 clouds are bad ; swirl at edge of a storm pattern means take cover
we *'ve* had our share of disaster , he says : @entity141 bombing , *previous* tornadoes
@entity198 : we make sense of it by helping out , finding meaning in acts of selflessness
