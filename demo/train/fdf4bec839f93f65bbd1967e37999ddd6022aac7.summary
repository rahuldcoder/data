-- it was smooth sailing in the @entity3 , but things are looking much tighter in the @entity5 for a bipartisan budget proposal that aims to avert another government shutdown and relax sweeping forced spending cuts			1
still , despite strong opposition from @entity11 to the compromise , supporters are within striking distance of rounding up the votes they need to pass it in the @entity5 next week			1
top aides in both parties privately expressed confidence on friday the bill will get the necessary support , even if a couple of wary moderate @entity23 end up voting " no. " at least four @entity11 told @entity0 they are committed to backing procedural votes needed to pass the measure			1
that gets the 55 @entity23 â € ” most of whom are expected to support it -- close to the 60 votes needed to get the legislation through the chamber			1
final congressional approval of an elusive budget agreement that was overwhelmingly approved in the @entity3 and supported by the @entity3 would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a @entity36 infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off			1
it would also avert another government shutdown like the one in october that @entity42 largely blamed on @entity36			1
" i think it would be outrageous to shut down the government and i 'm not going to do that to my constituents who i represent , " said sen. @entity43 , @entity44			2
other key @entity50 members in addition to @entity43 , sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , a moderate who often votes with @entity23 , said she will vote for the bill			1
sen. @entity56 , @entity57 , and sen. @entity58 , @entity44 , said they are undecided on the bill itself , but both will vote with @entity23 on the critical procedural motions			1
@entity23 think they have a chance of getting the support of sen. @entity67 , @entity68 , and sen. @entity69 , @entity70			1
each seemed to be struggling with their decision			0
" i would say it 's not as good an agreement i had hoped for but it 's a better agreement than i was afraid it might be			0
so i 'm certainly open to looking at it , " @entity69 said			0
" it needs to get done for a lot of good reasons ; we want to avoid a shutdown , clearly , " @entity67 said			2
" do i like a lot of the stuff in it ? eh , no. " most @entity86 , raising a variety of concerns , are expected to vote against the bill			2
" i 'm concerned we have once again kicked the can down now a long road , " said sen. @entity90 , @entity91 , who said he is undecided			0
" i 'm leaning strongly against it , " said sen. @entity95 , @entity96 , a veteran lawmaker who opposes some of the fees the bill raises			2
budget deal struck the budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across - the - board spending cuts , known as the sequester , on hard - hit defense and non-defense programs			1
it does this , in part , by raising fees on airlines tickets , shrinking the retirement benefits of some veterans , extending some cuts to @entity117 providers , and imposing other fees			2
current federal spending expires in mid january , raising the possibility of another shut down at that time without a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled			1
the strong vote in the @entity3 on the budget plan on thursday -- 332 - 94 -- brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters who initially thought it would sail through the @entity5 where bipartisanship has been more the norm than in the sharply divided @entity3			1
but after reading details of the agreement , many @entity11 -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill			2
" i 'd really like to stay within the caps , " complained sen. @entity137 , @entity138			0
" this busts the caps and as a result i 'll vote against it			0
" " i believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees , " said sen. @entity144 , @entity96 - @entity145 , in announcing his opposition			2
" we need to find a better way to save $ 6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans , " said sen. @entity152 , @entity153 who said he would vote against the bill			2
@entity161 , @entity152 , and sen. @entity162 , @entity163 , sent a letter to their @entity5 colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits			1
it was unclear if the emergence of the politically sensitive issue would increase opposition			0
one @entity172 said outside interest groups for service members and veterans were caught off guard to the provision in the agreement and were just now beginning to mobilize against it			0
sen. @entity180 , @entity181 , said he finds the military pension issue " bothersome ' but remains undecided on how to vote			0
" i would n't say leaning ' yes ' or leaning ' no. ' i 'm very concerned about the package but i can also see the merits of a two year deal			0
so i want the weekend to think about it , " he said			0
the retiring first - term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the @entity5 regardless of the way he votes			1
midterm primaries , and 2016 the top @entity5 @entity50 , @entity191 , @entity192 , has hinted strongly he will vote against it			1
he cites the weakening of budget sequester as a key complaint			0
the same is true for his top two lieutenants -- sen. @entity197 of @entity198 and sen. @entity199 of @entity200 -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise			0
@entity204 and @entity197 are up for re-election and both facing primary challenges from the right			0
that might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts , which are very popular with conservative voters			1
three leading tea party - backed senators -- @entity215 of @entity216 , @entity217 of @entity198 , and @entity218 of @entity219 , -- each with 2016 presidential aspirations , also have come out against it for similar reasons			0
" the new budget deal moves in the wrong direction : it spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for @entity228			0
i can not support it , " @entity217 said .			0

the @entity3 passed a compromise budget bill easily , sending it to the @entity5
@entity233 aims to avert another government shutdown as early as mid january
it would also ease *unpopular* spending cuts to the military and other programs
*majority* @entity23 need some @entity50 support to get measure through @entity5
