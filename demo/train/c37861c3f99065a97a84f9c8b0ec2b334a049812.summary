-- for one day , at least , you can call off the cyberwar			2
the @entity3 has revealed an unclassified version of its " @entity5 in @entity6			1
" and despite a drumbeat of scare talk and digital sabre - rattling in @entity11 , the document takes a measured , reasonable approach -- focusing on good network hygiene and data - sharing , rather than bombing hackers into submission			2
the question is whether this public summary conveys what 's actually in the classified strategy , or reflects the real mood of the @entity3			1
" @entity3 would like to be much more aggressive in what it says and how it acts , " says a source familiar with the development of the strategy			1
" but that tendency to be aggressive has been reined in by the @entity27 , @entity28 , and the @entity29 , and not in an unreasonable way			1
" listen to the talk inside the @entity32 -- and especially within the @entity3 -- and you 'd think hackers were about to reach their hands through our computers , and strangle us all in our sleep			1
wired : insiders doubt 2008 @entity3 hack was foreign spy attack " the @entity45 is fighting a cyber-war today , and we are losing , " retired admiral and former @entity44 chief @entity42 wrote in the @entity48 last year			1
defense secretary @entity49 claimed cyber attacks could be the " next @entity51 we confront			2
" or perhaps the next @entity52			2
senator @entity53 declared that " cyberweapons and cyberattacks potentially can be devastating , approaching weapons of mass destruction in their effects " during an april 2010 (			2
according to the @entity61 , the @entity3 has come to the conclusion that " computer sabotage ... can constitute an act of war			1
" as one military official tells the paper : " if you shut down our power grid , maybe we will put a missile down one of your smokestacks			0
" yet the @entity3 strategy uses tones of cooperation , not confrontation , in the strategy it released today			1
" by sharing timely indicators about cyber events , threat signatures of malicious code , and information about emerging actors and threats , allies and international partners can increase collective cyber defense , " the document notes			0
" cyberspace is a network of networks that includes thousands of @entity95 [ @entity95 ] across the globe ; no single state or organization can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own			0
" wired : cyber war hype intended to destroy the open internet yes , there are all kinds of bad guys out there on the internet , the strategy adds			2
but many of them are out for money , not for blood			0
" the tools and techniques developed by cyber criminals are increasing in sophistication at an incredible rate , and many of these capabilities can be purchased cheaply on the internet			0
" and the best way to stop these crooks is through strong passwords , up - to - date software , and keeping unclassified disks and drives off of secret systems			2
" most vulnerabilities of and malicious acts against @entity3 systems can be addressed through good cyber hygiene , " document adds			1
if there was a nod to the @entity133 crowd -- who 'd like to " reengineer the internet " to make everyone trackable online -- it was in the declaration that " @entity3 will pursue revolutionary technologies that rethink the technological foundations of cyberspace			1
" but the nod was a subtle one			0
behind closed doors , some @entity3 officials take a much harder line			1
there have been calls to massively shift @entity3 spending from defensive measures to online offense			1
other countries -- especially the @entity151 , they believe -- had infiltrated every corner of the military - industrial complex , and need to be shoved back			0
every fresh online break - in brings a fevered call to declare the intrusion an " act of war			1
" but that view is not universally shared in @entity11			0
" there is no cyberwar , " @entity29 cyber czar @entity159 has repeatedly said			0
and those more rational voices helped keep the rhetoric in this @entity3 strategy from overheating			1
as one source who watched the strategy develop , says : " this the result of a long , political process			2
" but this is hardly the final document , gen. @entity171 tells reporters			0
" this strategy talks more about how we are going to defend the networks , " says @entity171 , the vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and one of the most influential voices on cybersecurity in the @entity3			1
" the next iteration will have to start to talk about here 's a strategy that says to the attacker , ' if you do this , the price to you is going to go up			0
it 's not just free			0
' " " today , we are on a path that is way too predictable			0
there is no penalty for attacking right now , " @entity171 adds			0
" we 've got to figure out a way to change that			0
