@entity0 , @entity1 -- armed with glossy sales catalogs and a shy swagger , @entity3 hopes to transform his family - run firm from a manufacturer of hum - drum fishing vessels and houseboats into a maker of sophisticated super yachts			1
his company makes up to six 86 - foot and 98 - foot yachts a year at its shipyard in @entity0 , southern @entity1 , under its @entity16 brand			1
the name was coined by @entity3 because it " sounded @entity18			0
" the company aims to compete in a marketplace currently dominated by @entity22 yacht makers like @entity23 and @entity24 and count billionaires among its clients			1
" @entity33 would never buy our brand but i hope in 10 years time he might consider it , " said @entity3 , 36 , referring to @entity28 's richest man , who is rumored to keep an 84 - foot @entity18 - made @entity30 yacht at an exclusive @entity32 marina			2
@entity3 's attempt to move upmarket is a reflection of @entity1 's changing industrial base and the challenges many @entity1 companies face as they try to move away from mass - produced goods to higher - value , branded products			1
the company sold seven vessels to buyers in @entity32 and @entity1 in the last financial year			2
it remains to be seen whether the brand - conscious ranks of @entity1 's newly affluent will embrace a home - grown yacht - builder with little pedigree - though a cheaper price tag may appeal as the country 's economic growth begins to slow			1
what 's more , @entity16 and @entity1 's other budding yacht makers such as @entity57 and @entity58 , face stiff competition from @entity22 and @entity62 rivals , who see @entity1 as a much - needed money spinner while their traditional markets struggle			1
located in a sleepy corner of the @entity69 , the shipyard where @entity16 's yachts are produced is a world away from the luxury marinas where these rich man toys end up			2
the drive from the nearest city passes through villages dotted with ponds filled with lotus flowers			0
fishing nets and the odd fish hang to dry by the roadside			0
the shipyard employs around 100 people and is run by @entity3 's father and brother			0
workers are busy spray - painting a house - boat and crafting the interior of a three - storey , 86 - foot yacht that will be delivered to a @entity32 businessman by the end of the year			0
@entity3 , who is based in @entity32 , says that @entity1 's cheaper labor costs are the main reason @entity16 's vessels cost a third of those produced by the likes of @entity24 and @entity23			1
skilled workers at the shipyard earn , on average , 6,000 yuan ( $ 957 ) a month but @entity3 says it can be difficult to find staff with the right experience			0
the 98 - foot yacht costs around $ 5 million and takes up to 15 months to build , while the 86 - foot model costs around $ 1.2 million			0
the workers , some wearing only plastic sandals , deftly make their way along narrow , five - meter high concrete platforms that divide the slipways and cranes that keep the vessels steady while they 're being built			0
at the center of the shed , which is littered with building materials , is a red shrine where apples , tea and incense have been made as offerings to a folk god for construction workers			0
when i first came across @entity16 's yachts at a boat show in @entity32 in may 2011 , the vessels did not look out of place in the marina full of @entity18 and @entity129 - made yachts , but the interior smelt synthetic and compared poorly to the richly hued timber and buttery leather used by the @entity22 brands			2
@entity3 says he has since employed @entity18 consultants to improve the yacht 's design both inside and out			2
" we are focused on matching our customer 's preference , " he said			0
he says that many of his clients use the boats for business and entertaining -- a karaoke den is a common request			0
@entity147 , editor of @entity148 , says that @entity1 yacht builders are a " mixed bag " but some , such as @entity58 's steel and aluminum hulled vessels , are beginning to gain recognition			1
" their products are at the lower end of the scale , " he said			0
" at half the price or less of international names , you have to sacrifice in terms of quality			0
" @entity164 , the @entity28 managing director of @entity129 yacht builder @entity24 , said @entity1 yacht builders are credible competitors , especially for smaller , family boats			1
however , he said they are yet to mount a serious challenge in the corporate market where premium brands are most coveted			0
read : inside the mind of a yacht cartoonist other @entity1 companies are taking a different approach to grass - roots brands like @entity16 , opting instead to scoop up foreign yacht brands as a shortcut to global success			1
earlier this year , @entity179 , best known for its bulldozers , took a 75 % stake in luxury @entity18 yacht maker @entity182 , which also makes @entity30 and @entity30 yachts			2
it plans to open an assembly plant in @entity185 , a major port in northern @entity1 and the site of the 2008 @entity188 sailing regatta , to customize yachts for @entity1 's market			1
@entity147 says that @entity22 brands like @entity23 and @entity24 have " made a killing " in @entity1 as the country 's elite discovers the pleasures of messing about on boats			1
but he warned that yachting 's long - term development may be limited by steep taxes , onerous regulation and a lack of marinas			1
for @entity3 and his @entity16 yachts , the next step is to build a larger shipyard , with state - of - the - art facilities , that would allow for up to 15 yachts to be made a year			0
currently , electronics and other finishing touches are installed in @entity32 , which means the yachts incur customs duties for @entity1 buyers			2
but with @entity1 's economy experiencing its slowest growth in more than a decade , @entity3 is concentrating on promoting his brand : " the biggest difficulty , we think , is to convince customers to spend their money on yachts that have been manufactured in @entity1			1
