-- @entity2 heavies and other glitterati descend on @entity4 on saturday night to light up the capital and lighten up the press corps			1
it 's the annual @entity9 correspondent 's dinner			1
there 's a red carpet , a presidential appearance , comedic relief and to make it all real , swanky after - parties			2
this year marks the 100th soiree , most of which have featured a fancy dinner and the president in attendance			1
in the early years , it was a small affair for 50			1
but in contemporary times , it has ballooned into a premier @entity26 event at a huge hotel ballroom			0
@entity0 asked @entity28 , who serves as the dinner 's executive director , when did it become such a mob scene , and why ? " coincidentally , when i first started , " she said and paused for effect , with a chuckle			1
it happened in 1993 , she said			0
" but it was because it was @entity37 's first dinner			1
they had a very large @entity2 following , and they wanted to be at the dinner			1
" the president tells jokes , a famous entertainer tells jokes , and reporters are called to the dais to collect awards			1
this year , @entity0 's @entity49 will be recognized for some of her reporting on the @entity52 administration			1
over the past two decades , it 's become something of a @entity4 parlor game to see what news organization can snag the hottest movie stars , reality show personalities , pop singers and sports greats of the moment to be guests			0
oh , and up - and - coming politicians or heavy - hitters in the @entity52 administration are good gets , too			2
this year , @entity0 employees will dine with actress @entity67 , as well as @entity69 gov. @entity68 , @entity71 gov. @entity70 and @entity73 chair @entity72 on the right , as well as @entity9 spokesman @entity75 and @entity77 spokesman @entity76 on the left			0
but with the crush of bold - faced names from @entity2 getting bigger each year , @entity79 have gotten increasingly star - struck			2
by the time the dinner arrives , well - known journalists rush for celeb autographs and selfies for their social media feeds			2
the dynamic led to the moniker " @entity89			0
" it 's a title not everyone involved finds particularly affectionate , like @entity92			0
at 68 , she says she still has energy to keep doing this job , and this will not be the last dinner she oversees			0
" when i get that head table in , and they start to present the colors and the @entity102 starts playing , i think , ' this is not @entity103 , this is pretty cool , ' " she said			0
she got the now - coveted job after several years running a similar -- but smaller -- press dinner			2
and every year since she began , demand has risen			0
that 's especially true since @entity52 became president , in part because he has an even bigger @entity2 following than the @entity112 had during their @entity9 years			1
@entity113 , best known as host of @entity116 's satire show " @entity117 " and star of @entity120 's comedy " @entity121 , " is this year 's host			2
he 's excited about the honor , and even got some advice from some of the entertainers who came before him , which he shared with @entity0 's @entity127			0
" and it was ... all pretty much the same advice , which was , ' this will be the weirdest thing you ever do and it will be the most exhilarating thing you ever do ... and keep it short			0

annual @entity134 's dinner is major soiree in nation 's capital
media a tough *audience* , but @entity2 and comedy mark the evening
in a *tuxedo* , president @entity52 *commands* the dais for a few jokes of his own
it 's the 100th dinner ; it was small in the early years , but became a mob scene once the @entity112 arrived
