-- @entity1 might have masterminded @entity3 's charge to wrest the @entity4 back from the @entity5 in 2010 but a hat - trick of the continent 's best players are adamant he should not be allowed to reprise his role			1
world no. 1 @entity10 reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain @entity13 on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with @entity15			1
the 23 - year - old -- a two - time major winner -- claimed @entity1 would have " nothing to gain " from taking the job on again and his stance was backed by @entity22 pair @entity20 and @entity23			1
@entity13 , a three - time @entity4 winner as a player , captained @entity10 at the @entity26 in 2009 , when @entity27 and @entity28 played against @entity3			1
" it 's something i feel quite strongly about ; i feel @entity13 deserves his chance , " @entity10 told @entity0 from @entity30			1
" he 's been vice captain a few times , he 's holed the winning putt in the @entity4			2
" i played under him as a captain in the @entity26 a few years ago and thought he was the best captain i 've ever played under			0
" i think he 's very deserving and i think it would almost be a little unfair if he did n't get it			0
" earlier , at his @entity15 press conference , @entity10 said : " i personally do n't feel @entity39 has anything to gain over this			0
" if we go to @entity42 and lose , he 's already a winning @entity4 captain			1
i 'm fully behind @entity13 and i think @entity13 should get the job and hopefully he does			0
" @entity20 was instrumental in @entity3 's comeback against the @entity5 in the latest installment of the biannual team competition , as they recovered from a 10 - 6 deficit to retain the trophy in what was known as ' the miracle of @entity52 ' in october			1
@entity23 delivered two vital points -- one in saturday 's fourballs and again in the crucial opening singles match against @entity58 champion @entity57			0
along with @entity10 , both were instrumental in @entity1 's winning turn at @entity61 in @entity62 in 2010 but none of the trio think the legendary @entity65 should be appointed again			2
it had seemed to be a straight battle between 2011 @entity69 champion @entity68 , and @entity28 compatriot @entity13 , who both served as vice captains to @entity71 in @entity72			0
but when the @entity5 turned once again to @entity74 , the last @entity5 captain to triumph on @entity76 soil in 1993 , @entity1 's name began to circulate			1
@entity77 : what kind of @entity15 poster boy will @entity10 be ? ahead of the announcement on either tuesday or wednesday in @entity30 , @entity1 has emerged as favorite and the 49 - year - old has confirmed he would do it again if asked			2
but @entity20 took to micro-blogging site @entity85 to say : " @entity68 ( @entity68 ) has taken his name out of the running for @entity4 captaincy			2
it would be fantastic to have @entity13 as the 2014 captain			2
" his view was shared by @entity23 , who became the first man to top the money lists on both the @entity76 and @entity93 in 2011			0
he tweeted : " i hope @entity13 gets his chance , he 's been an amazing vice captain and deserves an opportunity			0
" the announcement will be made after a 15 - man committee that includes @entity1 , @entity68 and @entity13 meets to decide .			0

@entity10 reiterates support for @entity13 in @entity4 captain race
@entity102 backs @entity103 for @entity3 's 2014 contest with @entity5 in @entity105
@entity10 says @entity1 has " nothing to gain " by doing job again
@entity20 and @entity23 also back @entity13 to take captaincy
