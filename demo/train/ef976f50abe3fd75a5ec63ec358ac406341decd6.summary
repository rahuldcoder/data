-- @entity1 , who resigned as ceo of the world 's largest tech company late wednesday , is often identified as the singular face of @entity6 -- the man who is the energy and creative spirit behind the company			1
but @entity6 is much more than just @entity1			1
@entity1 himself has said so in the past			2
" @entity6 is an incredibly collaborative company , " @entity1 said in an onstage interview at a tech conference last year			1
" we 're organized like a startup			0
we 're the biggest startup on the planet			0
" not everyone buys this argument , of course , and @entity6 stocks fell 5 % in after - hours trading on wednesday after his resignation was announced in a letter			2
@entity1 has been elected as @entity6 's chairman , but some observers question how much he will be able to contribute due to health reasons			1
the 56 - year - old went on a medical leave of absence earlier this year , his third time as ceo			0
at the @entity34 tech event last year , @entity1 boasted that @entity6 's corporate structure does n't include committees , which is a common practice among big business for distributing the responsibility for strategy among key executives			1
a different person leads each hardware , software and business division , he said			0
" teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time , " @entity1 said at the time			2
" we 're great at figuring out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing , touch bases frequently and bring it all together into a product			0
" furthermore , @entity6 has a succession plan in place			2
@entity60 , the operations wizard who is replacing @entity1 as ceo , already has proven himself an adept manager			1
@entity60 filled in as interim ceo during @entity1 ' three medical leaves			1
@entity1 announced his most recent absence in january , and @entity60 has taken over his duties since then			1
@entity6 has set business performance records during every quarter this year			0
in his resignation letter , @entity1 wrote that he strongly recommended @entity60 's appointment			1
" i believe @entity6 's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it , " @entity1 wrote			1
" and i look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role			0
" " @entity1 's extraordinary vision and leadership saved @entity6 and guided it to its position as the world 's most innovative and valuable technology company , " @entity71 , an @entity6 board member , said in a statement , adding that the board " has complete confidence that @entity60 is the right person to be our next ceo			1
" the ceo of any company has an important role , but @entity6 is structured in a way where it 's less so , according to @entity1			1
@entity1 ' influence touches practically all facets of the company , analysts say			0
in the onstage interview , @entity1 described his role as having to meet with the various units and contribute ideas			2
but what features make it into the next @entity95 or @entity96 is often determined by the people who are dedicated to working on their respective products , he said			0
" if you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you , you have to let them make a lot of decisions , and you have to be run by ideas , not hierarchy , " @entity1 said			2
" the best ideas have to win , otherwise good people do n't stay			0
" at @entity6 , the good people @entity1 is referring to are part of the " top 100 , " a group that convenes regularly at off - site locations to share ideas , according to a recent @entity113 article			1
a smaller group of executives also meets weekly to discuss the business , @entity1 said			0
" we all meet for three hours once a week , and we talk about everything we 're doing , " @entity1 said			0
" and there 's tremendous teamwork at the top of the company , which filters down to tremendous teamwork through the company			0
" as @entity1 ' managerial presence dwindles , @entity6 is in no immediate danger , because his thinking has been ingrained into many of the company 's 46,600 employees , industry analyst @entity125 said in a statement			1
@entity6 outlines its product plans five years in advance and " has a deep bench of executives who know how @entity1 thinks , what his vision is for the next decade and are more than capable , " @entity125 wrote			1
@entity1 and others have indicated that @entity6 is poised to continue producing popular products , and so most consumers wo n't notice a change , @entity139 , a @entity140 analyst , said in a recent interview			2
" i do n't think the average person cares what 's going on with @entity6 's leader , " she said			0
@entity6 is driven by " core values , " @entity1 said last year , not by one man			2
" we have the same values now , as we had then , " he said			0
" we 're a little more experienced , certainly beat - up , but the core values are the same			0

@entity6 *founder* @entity1 says he is not the sole decision maker at @entity6
@entity1 resigns as ceo of @entity6 , appointing @entity60 who is *familiar* with that role
@entity6 is organized in a way so that many people share responsibilities , @entity1 says
