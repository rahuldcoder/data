@entity0 is a stark reminder of what can go wrong in extreme sports			1
the @entity5 - based young @entity4 is also a powerful advertisement for putting safety first when you tackle a stunt laced with potentially fatal risks			1
@entity0 was n't even out of his teens when the sport with which he was obsessed almost killed him			1
yet , he came back from the brink to chalk up a world first -- and secure a job at the busiest sky diving center in the @entity17			1
the 24 - year - old is a familiar figure at @entity5 , where he is one of just two qualified master parachute riggers in the @entity21			1
earlier this year , @entity0 achieved even more notoriety when he completed 11 so - called base jumps -- from a fixed structure or cliff -- in four days in the @entity27 fjords			1
leaving his wheelchair at the summit of a 3,000 - foot ( 914 meters ) peak , he pushed himself off and became the first disabled person to successfully make such a jump unassisted			2
by rights the @entity34 - born sportsman should n't be here at all			2
at 18 , a jump stunt went wrong and left him fighting for his life with a broken back , a torn aorta , battered lungs and kidneys , and paralyzed from the chest down			1
@entity0 emerged from his coma and had a question for the doctors who saved him			1
" ' when can i start skydiving again ' , i asked , " he recalls			2
inspirational journey most people would have quit and considered their luck at surviving			2
yet , not only did @entity0 dive out of a plane six months later , he became one of just two disabled people in the world to complete a base jump			1
then , in march of this year , he was taken on by @entity5 , impressed by his skills when he competed for the @entity4 in an accuracy skydive event over @entity5			1
@entity0 acknowledges his wheelchair makes some rookie skydive customers nervous , but his journey is nothing short of inspirational			1
he says : " it is good for them to see me as anything is a possibility			2
" the paralysis i have is n't that common			2
you either survive or you do n't			0
" half my body survived and half did n't			0
that 's why i 'm in a wheelchair			0
but what you do afterward speaks a lot			0
a lot of people get paralyzed and they just let themselves go and get reclusive			2
" @entity0 was a veteran of 2,800 jumps when he broke his body during a speed - flying attempt in @entity79 , where he worked for a skydive business			1
a hybrid of paragliding and base jumping , it involved leaping from a cliff			0
" i was trying new things and things did n't quite go to plan and my parachute collapsed			0
i fell a couple of hundred feet and broke my back and damaged a lot of my insides			2
" you have this wing that 's laid out behind you			0
i was going to run and the parachute would inflate and i was going to start gliding down the mountainside			0
" once i was airborne i was going to try to get enough altitude so i could release that parachute and open up a secondary parachute			0
" in the midst of all the action and with a new special harness i had built , i was flying for about 10 seconds and that parachute prematurely released and i did n't have enough altitude to deploy my secondary chute			0
" @entity104 checks @entity0 pauses as he recalls the moment			1
" i should have been dead			0
" the doctors did a good job of putting me back together			2
it takes a while to get healthy enough to even get out of bed let alone get in an airplane , but thankfully within six months i was			0
" @entity0 took a year to fully rehabilitate			1
he studied air traffic control , but struggled to get a job , so then decided to head to @entity114 in order to become a master parachute rigger			0
" i was responsible for my equipment that day in @entity79 and it has made me a very detail orientated person today			0
not only do i double check everything , i triple check and ask opinions of other qualified people , " he says			0
these days @entity0 is among just a dozen wheelchair skydivers in the world and remains part of the @entity4 parachuting team that competed over @entity5			1
" when i got hurt i thought i would never get to go to @entity5 and check out all the cool things there			1
so to be in @entity5 right now is really a dream come true , " says @entity0 , who still manages 200 jumps a year			1
" i never thought it would be possible to work here in my condition but you put your mind to it and anything can happen			1
it took that accident almost to realize how much passion i have for the job i do now			0
" my grandfather and my father were skydivers			0
i 've been around it all my life , so even with something as dramatic as getting paralyzed , that 's not going to slow me down			2
" if there 's a will there 's a way			0
i 've found the way and it 's awesome to continue doing what i love			0

@entity0 was paralyzed at the age of 18 by a stunt jump that went wrong
now 24 , @entity0 is back in the skies , working as a skydiving *instructor* in @entity5
" you put your mind to it and anything can happen , " says @entity0
