-- with the world 's population set to reach the seven billion milestone later this year the challenge of feeding our planet has never been more urgent			1
but that challenge could become even greater as current models predict our population could reach nine billion by 2050			1
is feeding these extra two billion people a mission impossible ? not according to study published in january by the @entity14 research agencies the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) & @entity16 ( @entity17 )			1
the resulting report titled " @entity19 " optimistically concludes it is possible to sustainably feed the future , though nothing short of a revolution in food production , distribution and consumption is required to do it			1
most predictions in the field verge on the apocalyptic , warning of extreme shortages of food and widespread hunger in a rapidly expanding population			2
depleting natural resources , land degradation , natural disasters and the impact of continued climate change also often hit the headlines			0
" these fears are strongly related to the periods of food price volatility in 2007 , 2008 and today , " says @entity41 , deputy delegate in charge of foresight at @entity15			0
" ( they ) are also sustained by players who have interests in keeping our agro-industrial farming systems unchanged , in focusing on the goal of increasing yields even at the expense of the preservation of the environment and natural resources			0
" the @entity58 's @entity57 has predicted that we will need to increase food production of 70 % by 2050			1
however @entity61 proposes an alternative scenario that would need an increase of just 35 %			2
it suggests that increased food production from sustainable improvements and changing the consumption habits of the developed world would be enough to meet this goal			1
@entity71 's authors suggest that by consuming 25 % less in developed countries , developing regions , such as @entity74 , could increase consumption by 30 %			2
one key to achieving @entity71 's proposal is convincing people in rich countries to limit their waste and meat consumption and create more even distribution of animal products in diets around the world			0
" of course , it does not mean that what can be ' spared ' in the rich countries could directly be used to feed population in developing countries , " explains @entity41			0
" it means that diffusion of our food consumption pattern all over the world would have a dramatic impact on natural resources and our ability to feed the planet in the future			0
" the uptake of more radical innovations , such as drought resistant @entity101 crops , is another solution to increase food production , suggests @entity71 's report			1
" the main challenge will be in the rapid scaling up of these experiences , through knowledge dissemination and strong public policies , especially in developing countries , " says @entity41			0
" we have to make a shift of paradigm and this always encounters resistance from society and from economic players who find advantages in keeping the food and agricultural system unchanged			0

global population is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050
@entity58 says food production will have to increase by 70 % to meet needs
@entity14 report suggests a lower target but revolution in food production and consumption needed
