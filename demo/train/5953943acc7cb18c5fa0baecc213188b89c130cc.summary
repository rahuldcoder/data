@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's top legal official " misled " the government over the case for war in @entity8 under pressure from then prime minister @entity10 , a former cabinet minister claimed tuesday			1
@entity11 , who was @entity10 's international development secretary until she quit over the @entity8 invasion , said attorney general @entity13 withheld his own " doubts and changes of opinion " in giving the go - ahead for war			1
" i think he misled the @entity18			0
he certainly misled me , but people let it through , " @entity11 told an inquiry into @entity4 's role in the march 2003 @entity8 invasion			1
the inquiry -- @entity4 's fifth examination of its @entity8 involvement -- has already grilled senior figures including @entity10 , former defense minister @entity27 and @entity4 's top military commander @entity28			1
@entity11 said that @entity13 , who last week testified before the inquiry that he was initially ambivalent but later adamant over the legality of the war , was wrong to press the case			1
@entity13 initially advised @entity10 in january 2003 that it would be unlawful to invade @entity8 without a @entity35 resolution but changed his mind a month later			1
" i think for the attorney general to come and say there 's unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading			2
" @entity11 said @entity13 was " leaned on " by @entity10 to agree to the war			1
" @entity13 said he was excluded from lots of meetings -- that 's a form of pressure			2
" it was suggested to him that he go to the @entity46 to get advice about the legal position			0
" you have got the @entity51 administration who have very low respect for international law			0
it seems the most extraordinary place in the world to go to get advice about international law			0
" she added : " i think all that was leaning on -- sending him to @entity46 , excluding him and then including him			0
" her comments came just days after @entity10 appearance at the inquiry generated protests , with several hundred anti-war campaigners gathering outside the @entity0 venue chanting " @entity10 lied , thousands died " and other slogans			2
@entity10 denied claims he had struck a secret deal with @entity46 president @entity51 in 2002 pledging @entity4 backing for the invasion and said he believed " beyond doubt " his unfounded pre-war claim that @entity8 was capable of launching chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes			2
@entity10 : no ' covert ' deal with @entity51 over @entity8 analysts say involvement in the @entity8 war remains a " live political issue " in the @entity4 , because the same government -- now led by @entity85 -- was still power , whereas the parties of other leaders in the @entity46 and @entity89 have been voted out of office			1
" the others have faced critical public scrutiny and been damaged by that , " legal expert @entity92 of @entity94 told @entity2			0
" the @entity4 have n't had a change of administration so in many ways it remains a live political issue because it reflects on people who are in government			0
" @entity2 's @entity104 contributed to this report			0
