-- in the @entity2 , where power extends from seniority and most politicians pride themselves on longevity , @entity1 has humbly outlasted them all			1
retiring thursday after 41 years , the @entity2 subway car operator has served longer than any current member of the @entity2 and all but two members of the @entity10			1
longevity that is hard to grasp @entity12 came to the @entity2 , not long out of high school , in 1972			1
first a worker with the night labor division , he then moved into his second and final job as a subway driver / mechanic			1
ever since , the 62 - year - old 's office has been a single swivel seat inside a small open - air jostling train cab			1
his task has been to carry senators back and forth from the @entity25 to their office buildings			1
by one estimate , @entity12 has made the trip 130,000 times			0
the longevity is hard to grasp , from an era where many @entity32 expected to work in a single place for 30 or 40 years			2
@entity12 has worked in the @entity25 during every historic event the nation has seen since the time of @entity41			1
when he began , the @entity42 was barely a decade old and @entity44 still had a king			0
and in all that time , @entity12 never once stepped onto the @entity2 floor			1
41 years , then first steps onto the @entity2 floor " that was incredible , " the bespectacled man beamed as he told @entity0 about the trip two floors above the subway , into the much more majestic @entity2 chamber			1
" that was really special			0
i do n't know how else to describe it			0
incredible , " he said			0
top leaders from the @entity60 and @entity61 parties took to the floor to recognize @entity12 , the man who had almost no power except for what he was able to do with the few minutes @entity32 leaders sat on his train			2
what he did was smile			0
" he has a smile the covers his whole face , " senate majority leader @entity71 said in a tribute on the @entity2 floor			1
that smile has made @entity12 a bit of a legend in the echoing , sterile @entity80 halls			0
he wears it for the crankiest of politicians and on the longest of overnight sessions			0
" he 's the happiest guy you ever met , " followed @entity71 's adversary , @entity85 senate leader @entity85			2
" he has a genius for lifting people 's spirits			2
" @entity90 relayed the story of one of his staffers who on her first , nervous day on @entity94 , asked @entity12 for directions			0
the subway operator gave them to the young woman and then , @entity90 recounted , he said something simple that she never forgot in the overstressed workplace : " everything will be alright			2
" lines outside his subway car the job of subway driver is monotonous			1
shuttling back and forth , back and forth , underground for the one - to - two - block distance between buildings			0
responding to a buzzer that senators can sound when they are in a particular hurry			2
it is the kind of job and @entity12 is the kind of worker that both parties talk about in vague rhetoric all the time			0
but thursday , @entity12 took in very specific congratulations from the powerful and nearly - powerful all day long			0
small lines formed as senators , staffers and visitors stood by his subway car to shake his hand and offer goodbye hugs			1
dozens of reporters signed a card for him			0
( disclosure : including this reporter			0
) " @entity137 may not have a high approval rating these days , " @entity90 said as @entity12 sat in the chamber listening , " but nobody who ever has had the pleasure of riding @entity1 's train can leave without feeling a little bit better about this place			1

there is a small subway service that runs under the @entity25
@entity1 has been a driver for 41 years and now he 's retiring
he 's been around since the @entity41 years , and has outlasted just about everybody
he stepped onto the @entity2 floor for the first time on thursday , where senators paid a tribute
