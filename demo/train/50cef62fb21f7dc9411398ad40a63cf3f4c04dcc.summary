@entity0 -- will come out of hiding this week after operating incognito for nearly 45 years , a move that experts say defines a thawing of historically frosty cross-strait relations			2
functioning in @entity0 under the moniker of the " @entity14 " since the 1966 @entity15 , the office has often been mistaken as a private travel company because of its title , said @entity18 , @entity3 's director general of @entity0 & @entity4 affairs			2
the new office will be renamed and upgraded on july 15 to the @entity21 office , a title indicative of its true functions , @entity18 said			0
the decision to rename @entity26 's hub in @entity0 delineates a warming of relations between @entity29 and @entity26 , said @entity30 , a professor of political science at @entity32			1
and although @entity3 liaised solely with @entity0 , @entity30 said the local government " dared not do anything with @entity3 without the formal approval of @entity29 , period			1
" contact between @entity6 and @entity3 -- a self - ruled island -- has historically been defined by instability and limited diplomatic communication , @entity30 said			2
@entity6 views @entity3 as a breakaway province , separated since the civil war of the 1940s			2
but relations began improving shortly after the 2008 election of current @entity3 president , @entity44			1
although @entity44 is the leader of the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) -- which lost control of mainland @entity6 to the @entity47 during the @entity49 civil war in 1949 -- his policies have been largely friendly toward mainland @entity6 since being elected			1
@entity3 is also @entity0 's fourth largest trading partner , with a total trade value of more than us $ 35 billion , according to the @entity0 government			1
@entity6 remains @entity0 's most lucrative trade partner , valued at roughly us $ 400 billion - just fewer than 50 % of the @entity7 's total trade activity			1
because of its misleading name , the @entity0 office 's efforts to improve economic and cultural relations were " undermined , " @entity18 explained			0
" in @entity3 , the re-designation of the @entity14 has become the so - called barometer to gauge the relationship between @entity0 and @entity3			0
" the current relationship is " extremely close , " @entity18 said , in both economics and tourism			0
he said that 31,000 flights helped more than 3 million people from both sides visit each other for business and pleasure in 2010			0
@entity18 insisted that @entity26 had no formal or informal contact with @entity29 over the upgrading of their economic and cultural office in @entity0 or @entity4			1
" over the past eight months , we directly dealt with the @entity0 authority only			0
we had no discussion on this with @entity29 , " @entity18 said			0
" but i would n't be surprised if the @entity0 government sought from @entity29 for these negotiations			0
" however , @entity29 government spokesman @entity82 welcomed the announcement , heralding the upgrading of relations as a milestone in cross-strait relations			0
" this is a remarkable step in the development in @entity3 - @entity0 - @entity4 relations , it 's also a great achievement of the improving relationship among the four districts [ of the ] cross-strait , " @entity82 said in an interview with @entity3 's @entity89			1
@entity18 said the @entity3 @entity98 also approved @entity0 's request to open an analogous economic and cultural office in @entity26			1
the new office will operate in a similar fashion to @entity0 's economic offices in mainland @entity6 and facilitate " trade between @entity0 and @entity3 , investment promotion and enhancing cultural exchanges between the two places , " the @entity0 government said in a statement			1
" the formal setting up of @entity0 's multi-functional office in @entity3 signifies that the development of @entity0 - @entity3 relations has entered a new phase , " @entity0 's @entity109 told @entity1 in a statement			1
" we believe that there will be more frequent interaction between @entity0 and @entity3 , and that the dimension of work will be deepened			0
" under the current " one country , two systems " policy -- which defines @entity6 's policy toward its two sars -- , @entity0 and @entity4 enjoy a high degree of autonomy , a capitalist economy and a political system separate from the mainland			2
@entity6 , however , is responsible for the defense of the two regions as well as their foreign affairs			0
these stipulations are slated to end when the two regions are reintegrated with mainland @entity6 in 2047 and 2049 , respectively			2
@entity136 professor @entity135 said the announcement marked a significant step toward normalizing relations between @entity6 , @entity3 , @entity0 and @entity4			1
" this certainly is unprecedented because @entity0 has never had an office in @entity3 , " said @entity135 , the program director at the school 's college of humanities and law			2
" you could n't even conceive this until relations became much warmer			0
" @entity1 's @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
