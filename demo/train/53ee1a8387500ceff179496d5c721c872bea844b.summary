-- walk into a room on the 17th floor of @entity4 's @entity3 and you 'll be greeted by soft rose and burgundy toned colors , fresh flowers , fruit smoothies , fashion magazines , and a bathroom stocked with exclusive products , including day and night moisturizers			1
this might not sound all that appealing to @entity17 in accounting -- but that 's okay because he 'll never make it past the locked glass entrance to the floor			1
this is the @entity25 -- @entity27 's first hotel floor dedicated entirely to women -- and according to the hotel 's ceo @entity29 , it is designed by women , for women			1

when men come into a hotel room , the first thing they do is check the view , turn on the tv , plug in their computer , and check out the minibar			0
women on the other hand go straight for the bathroom			0
does it smell nice ? is it clean ? does it have a nice bathtub and shower ? " to get it right , the hotel asked a number of women what they wanted , and added to their list of priorities things like cleanliness , a nice bathroom , high - powered hairdryers , steam irons , cosmetic mirrors , healthy options on the room service menus , and full - body mirrors			1
@entity69 , professor and dean of students at the @entity72 at @entity73 , says the hotel is onto something			0
according to her research , women 's hotel preferences are very different than men 's with key priorities being to feel safe , comfortable , empowered , and valued			1
" the problem is that in many cases , no action has been taken to meet women 's needs , " she says			1
see also : women ! embrace your inner geek @entity89 , event coordinator with @entity90 and guest at the @entity25 floor agrees			2
" unlike other hotels , it seemed like someone actually thought about what women wanted			2
and there are so many women in my type of role traveling around the globe -- hotels need to wake up to that a bit			2
" it seems they are -- helped along by the boom in female business travelers			1
global numbers are hard to come by but research cited in @entity69 's @entity73 report shows women accounting for nearly half of all business travelers in the @entity116 in 2010 , up from approximately 25 % in 1991 -- and less than 5 % just 40 years ago			1
places like the @entity118 in @entity119 , the @entity120 in @entity121 , the @entity122 and the @entity123 in @entity125 @entity124 , seem to be realizing the potential in catering for women			0
see also : how girl geeks can get the best tech jobs the @entity130 says their @entity131 -- with its special offerings for women such as magazines , curling irons , nylon stockings , bath salts and yoga mats -- has been so successful they 're considering adding a second floor			1
at the @entity122 , management says bookings to their " @entity142 " -- which are standard rooms with fresh flowers , fruit , styling accessories , and other extras added -- have surged 25 % over the past year			1
but not everyone thinks this will last -- or that it 's a good idea			0
" a lot of hotels will jump along on this fad -- and prove me wrong -- but i think it 's a flash in the pan , " says @entity150 , @entity151 and founder of @entity153			2
she sees it as little more then an advertising gimmick			0
" i have seen the hotel industry cater subtly to women without being patronizing , for example by putting shower caps and nail files in the room , and adding a room service menu expanded beyond hamburger and fries to include a big salad			1
why not have standard rooms and extras being offered at the front desk ? we 've lived through fighting for our equal rights and this is making us unequal			0
" @entity177 , author and consultant on women 's issues and careers , participated in the @entity183 survey and sees no problem in targeting women as a segment			2
" a lot of hotel services are geared towards men , " she says			0
" if you want to sell three - wheelers you target them at two - year - olds , " she says			0
but @entity150 is not the only one who sees a problem			0
@entity196 's gender equality board has ruled the women - only floor in @entity3 discriminatory and illegal , following a complaint by a man			1
the hotel has been ordered to close the floor , but @entity29 refuses , saying he is prepared to take the case to court			0
" it 's no different then women having their own cycling club			2
should i be allowed to be part of that ? " discrimination and disagreements aside , the bottom line , says @entity69 , is that women will likely reward hotels that are " listening " to their preferences			2
" this comment may stir controversy but that 's okay			0
my personal guess , having focused on this subject for several years : men see the beer and nuts and go , " wow , food ! this is great ! " women see the smoothies and fruit and go , " i love this place -- they were thinking about my preferences			0
" but she adds , " it 's important for hoteliers to recognized that separate floors are just one way to address the situation			0

@entity4 's @entity3 was the first in @entity27 to dedicate a floor entirely to women
special touches in the rooms include fresh flowers , day and night moisturizers , and powerful hairdryers
hotels globally are adding women - only floors to cater to boom in female business travel
