-- now that @entity2 is finally a reality , how does it stack up against the cloud competition ? @entity6 's new cloud - based document and storage solution is priced aggressively and boasts best - in - class integration with other @entity6 services -- including @entity9			1
as you can see from our hands - on , @entity2 is an impressive product			1
still , the cloud storage and collaboration space is more competitive than ever before			0
@entity6 faces competition not just from cloud companies such as @entity17 and @entity18 , but from @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 as well			1
storage and pricing @entity6 is pricing @entity2 at a very aggressive level			2
for $ 30 a year ( $ 2.50 a month ) , users get @entity26 to use for @entity2 and @entity27 , plus @entity29 storage			1
this is more than what @entity21 and @entity20 charge for an additional @entity33 , but less than the price of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity17			1
for $ 60 a year ( $ 5 a month ) , @entity6 offers @entity36 and @entity27 storage ( plus @entity37 for @entity29 ) , which clocks in below @entity21 , @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity17			1
for penny pinchers , @entity20 's offer of @entity36 of additional storage -- on top of the 7 or @entity26 that users already get with the service -- is just $ 50 a year			1
@entity18 and @entity17 are among the more expensive services			0
in the case of @entity17 , the company 's real focus is on business users			2
in fact , the company has told us on multiple occasions that its focus is n't so much on @entity18 , but on @entity54			0
a @entity18 account costs more than three times what a @entity2 account costs			2
in this area , @entity6 is clearly trying to undermine its competition on a per - gb pricing basis			2
@entity17 's pricing is also significantly higher than @entity2 ; however , that differentiation is also part of the company 's focus			2
as @entity17 has told us on multiple occasions , it wants to replace @entity54 in the smb and enterprise space			0
while @entity6 is also looking in this direction , @entity17 has a bevy of services and integrations that are focused on replacing a company 's central file server			0
upload limit the most limiting factor of the majority of cloud storage and collaboration services is n't the total amount of storage -- it 's the limitations on upload size			0
@entity6 has an impressive @entity87 limit on files or folders			2
this is significantly more than the @entity91 limit imposed by most cloud services			0
only @entity18 's desktop apps for @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 do better			0
with @entity18 , the only limitation is the size of a storage plan			0
collaboration and sharing like @entity20 's @entity102 , @entity2 offers in - browser access to files and folders , including document editing via @entity9			1
and like @entity107 , @entity17 and @entity108 , third - party applications can plug into @entity2 to retrieve or store files			1
this makes keeping apps synchronized across devices and platforms much more seamless			0
mobile integration although @entity2 's @entity116 app is already around , @entity6 is making @entity118 users wait for access to the app. this is in contrast to @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity107 , which all offer official or unofficial solutions for multiple mobile platforms			1
@entity21 and @entity19 are behind in the mobile access game			1
@entity19 makes @entity108 exclusively available to @entity127 users , and @entity21 's @entity128 only integrates with @entity116 ( and the integration is limited at that )			1
desktop integration part of the reason that @entity18 has such a loyal following is because of its fantastic desktop integration			0
@entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 users can automatically sync and share files from their native file systems without having to bother with desktop uploads			2
this is a similar approach to the one @entity17 has taken with its @entity142 service for @entity95 , and to what @entity20 employs for @entity107 for @entity95 and @entity94 @entity2 's desktop app works essentially the same as @entity107 -- in other words , it is n't as tightly coupled with the file system as @entity18 , but it does the job			2
final thoughts which cloud storage service an individual or business decides to use is a decision that should encompass more than just comparing specs and pricing			0
take time to use a service and see how it integrates into your workflow before plunking down cash on an upgrade			0
for users and businesses heavily tied to @entity9 , @entity2 will likely make sense			1
for those that love @entity18 or need some of @entity17 's more robust features , @entity2 might not fit the bill			2
for @entity172 users , consider giving @entity107 a try -- it works well and also offers online access to basic web and editing apps			1
ultimately , neither offering from @entity19 nor @entity21 is likely to compete with @entity2 -- the products are focused on different use cases			1
we 'd also like to give @entity181 's @entity180 a shout - out			0
we did n't include it in our direct comparison because of its more limited options , but for @entity95 and @entity188 users , its free service is worth a look as well			0
tell us your thoughts on the cloud storage and collaboration space			0
does @entity2 have the goods to compete ? let us know in the comments			1
