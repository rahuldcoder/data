-- the news that @entity2 has rejected independence from the rest of the @entity5 -- by a relatively close 55 - 45 margin -- has reassured financial markets and many governments across the world			1
not only does it secure the future ( for now , at least ) of one of the longest and most successful political unions in the world -- it also makes the prospect of a future @entity5 exit from the @entity17 less likely in coming years			1
numerous world leaders , from @entity20 president @entity19 to @entity22 prime minister @entity21 , had strongly asserted that it is in the best interests of the global community for the @entity5 to stay together			0
this reflects the fact that , while no longer a great power , @entity5 continues to play a significant role on the world stage with wide - ranging international interests			0
however , given the significant size of the " @entity35 " vote , uncertainties remain , including the possibility of another @entity2 independence referendum in the next decade or two			1
these unknowns could impact the @entity5 's ability to continue to punch above its weight on the global stage and will leave residual concerns for allies			1
internationally , it is the @entity20 , @entity45 and other key @entity5 allies which paid keenest attention to the vote outcome			1
this is because @entity5 foreign policy has centered , in the post-war period , around the strategic importance of its alliance with the @entity20 and integration with @entity45			2
in @entity56 , where @entity19 indicated his opposition to @entity2 independence repeatedly , there was perhaps the most significant apprehension of the outcome of yesterday 's vote			1
although @entity20 will be reassured by the result , some concerns will remain particularly about @entity5 's military capabilities , including the future of its nuclear arsenal , which is located in @entity2			1
this is particularly so in the context of the current 2015 - 16 @entity5 @entity69 , which will feature further cuts			0
some in @entity56 ( along with other allies ) will remain apprehensive about the future of the @entity5 @entity74 nuclear deterrent which is due for potential renewal in coming years			2
a further potential complication here is that @entity2 first minister @entity78 ran the " yes " campaign on a pledge that @entity2 would become a non-nuclear nation within five years under independence			0
given the significant support for this proposition , and the fact that most of @entity5 's @entity74 submarines are based in @entity2 , there may be growing pressure for relocation of these bases in coming years , despite the failure of the pro-independence movement to secure a majority			1
such a move will be a very expensive , protracted process which the @entity96 asserts will cost billions and take at least a decade			0
it is possible that this , allied with defence budget cutbacks , could significantly influence the @entity5 debate over renewal of @entity74 in coming years			0
such uncertainty will prompt added anxiety in @entity56 and amongst some other @entity5 allies , including @entity107			2
in @entity110 and @entity45 capitals , today 's decision will be welcomed in many quarters too			0
firstly , there is now a stronger likelihood that the @entity5 will not now leave the @entity17 in any " in - out " referendum			2
this is because @entity2 , in general , are more favorable toward continued membership of the @entity17 than the @entity117 who account for a majority of the @entity5 's population			1
thus , if @entity2 had voted for independence , and did n't take part in any subsequent @entity17 plebiscite , it would have been more likely that -- in a close vote -- that @entity5 could have left the @entity17			1
secondly , the outcome will please leaders in those @entity45 countries where other significant separatist movements exist			0
@entity131 , for instance , faces pressure for a binding referendum for @entity134 in coming months			0
a @entity2 " yes " vote could also have turbo - charged the separatist ambitions of @entity138 campaigners in @entity139 , the @entity140 in @entity141 , and , to a lesser extent , @entity144 separatists			0
while allies across the world will be at least partially reassured , the relatively close vote -- not to mention the significant devolution of powers from @entity149 to @entity150 that now seems likely -- means that the @entity5 is likely to be transformed			0
along with the possibility of another @entity2 referendum in the next decade or two , this means that the territorial integrity of @entity5 can not be taken for granted in the medium to long term			0
the continued possibility of the @entity5 's dismemberment may well undermine its generally high international stature in the eyes of many across the world			2
this is because @entity5 's international reputation rests , in large part , upon its stability as a unified state , as @entity19 has pointed out			2
these foreign concerns will be exacerbated by the fact that there will now be growing pressure in @entity170 and @entity171 for significant additional devolution			0
many foreigners , especially key allies , will therefore wonder if one or both of these areas will also remain in the union too in the long term			0
taken overall , today 's vote will provide reassurance for key @entity5 allies , especially the @entity20 and @entity45 , despite lingering concerns about the future of @entity5 's military capability			1
while the @entity5 's territorial integrity is assured in the short term , a second referendum in @entity2 can not be ruled out			1

@entity198 : @entity5 allies will breathe sigh of relief after @entity2 rejects independence
" no " vote makes @entity5 's proposed exit from the @entity17 less likely
questions remain about what to do with the @entity5 's @entity2 - based nuclear arsenal
@entity211 will please other @entity45 leaders *grappling* with secessionist movements
