-- as same - sex marriage has become accepted in a way that would have been unthinkable a decade ago , the media have -- perhaps unwittingly -- played a crucial role			1
it 's not that most journalists lean left on such social issues as gay rights , though that 's hard to dispute			2
it 's that the power of pictures can neutralize political propaganda			2
once same - sex marriage was legalized in such early states as @entity16 and @entity17 , the photos and footage of happy couples celebrating made clear that no one was really threatened by such unions			1
the visuals put a human face on the debate			0
even as stories quoted people who remained staunchly opposed to same - sex marriage , the pictures conveyed that the sky was not falling -- and by the time @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 legalized same - sex unions , it was , well , less newsworthy			1
but that 's hardly true everywhere , as a stunning backlash in @entity38 makes clear			1
the first known gay wedding in the town of @entity41 , @entity38 , was , naturally , a story for the local paper			1
and it was a story with a heart - rending twist			2
an article in the the @entity47 recounted @entity49 's wedding to @entity50 , who was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and has had three operations in the past year			2
it was a moving piece that described how @entity50 , at the wedding , wore a white cowboy hat to hide the scars from her latest surgery			2
" if chemo does n't work , " she said , " we do n't know what happens after that			0
" watch : is the murdered model 's beauty driving the @entity66 coverage ? the result : a torrent of angry calls , canceled subscriptions and outraged comments on the paper 's website and @entity75 page			2
as recounted by @entity77 , one person wrote : " this is what we have to put up with on the world news every night			0
@entity82 thought i would open my local paper and see such			0
insulting ! ! ! " said another : " it 's a sad day for traditional family values when this is printed on the front of a newspaper			0
" the paper 's owner , @entity90 , responded in an op - ed : " you do n't have to like something for it to be historic			1
the holocaust , bombing of @entity97 , and the @entity98 are all still historic			0
i 'm in no way comparing the downtown wedding of two females to any of these events ( even though some of you made it quite clear that you think gay marriage is much worse ) , i 'm just saying that whether you liked the story or not , the first known gay wedding to take place in @entity111 is still historic			1
" he added : " i ca n't help but be saddened by the hate - filled viciousness of many of the comments directed toward our staff			0
" watch : was the press ready to smear @entity119 over his out - of - wedlock baby ? the leader - call deserves credit for standing by a legitimate story that infuriated part of its readership			2
there was no attempt to glorify gays ; the piece simply recounted the wedding , which was purely symbolic , since @entity38 does n't allow same - sex marriage			1
what was stunning was the way some critics simply ignored the fact that one of the women is fighting for her life			0
maybe this resonates more deeply for taking place in the @entity141 , where many leading newspapers once staunchly defended racial segregation in a way that is now embarrassing -- and which prompted some of them to apologize decades later			0
at the same time , a column in sunday 's @entity148 makes clear that those who believe the press tilts too far toward same - sex marriage have a valid point			1
watch : @entity154 anchor who attacked wife gets the tabloid treatment ombudsman @entity157 reports on an e-mail dialogue he facilitated between a reader and a @entity148 reporter he declines to name			0
the reader complained that the @entity148 minimizes " the millions of @entity162 who believe in traditional marriage and oppose redefining marriage into nothingness			0
" the reporter said : " the reason that legitimate media outlets routinely cover gays is because it is the civil rights issue of our time			1
... the true conservative would want the government out of people 's bedrooms , and religion out of government			0
" that is bias , pure and simple			0
yes , it is a civil rights issue , but the reporter simply ca n't understand why anyone would have a different viewpoint other than that the government should not interfere on such issues as same - sex marriage and perhaps , by extension , abortion			1
if this seems outrageous to you , keep in mind that president @entity193 did not come out for same - sex marriage until the final months of his first term			1
many people are opposed to it for reasons ranging from tradition to religion , and we in the press have to respect that			0
watch : @entity204 launches forgiveness tour in @entity206 there was a time when most gay journalists remained closeted for fear of being penalized			0
a decade or two from now , as today 's younger people move into positions of power , opponents of same - sex marriage may seem as wrong - headed and their views as antiquated as those of people who defended keeping blacks at the back of the bus			1
the media must be even - handed on this divisive issue , but they might also take a page from a small @entity38 paper that bigotry should n't deter them from treating gay couples fairly			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : media has played role in growing *acceptance* of gay marriage
he says a @entity38 paper covered a same - sex wedding and outrage ensued
he says in another *instance* , a @entity33 reporter seemed to show bias on other side of issue
@entity231 : paper right to defend story ; @entity33 reporter shows media 's need to remain neutral
