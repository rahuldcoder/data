@entity0 , @entity1 -- many @entity1 , like @entity3 , @entity4 and others , have been provoked by media reports about a film called " @entity8 " that maligns the @entity9			1
last week , hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the @entity12 in the capital , @entity0 , and broke in			2
clashes between security forces and demonstrators left at least four protesters dead and more than 30 people injured , according to @entity1 officials			1
@entity1 have many problems and difficulties in their daily lives			1
nearly half of them live below the poverty line , almost seven million of them have no secure access to food , and they struggle to send their children to schools			2
such desperate situations are worsened by the ghost of separation in the south , the @entity37 militants in the north and threats from @entity40 , which at times launch suicide attacks			0
in spite of these conditions , @entity1 feel hurt by the film mocking the prophet			1
it is difficult for many outside the country to understand why the film is inflammatory to @entity51 : this , however , can not be explained unless considered within its context			0
the @entity9 is regarded as the highest authority in @entity51			0
through him the teachings of @entity51 and principles are revealed and conveyed : therefore to depict him as " womanizer " or " pedophile " is to claim wickedness at the foundation of the faith			0
besides , the content of the film is hostile , grossly inaccurate and prejudiced			0
it revealed the producer 's attitude toward the prophet rather than the prophet 's character			0
as such , @entity51 felt insulted by such depiction of their prophet			0
but there is disagreement among @entity1 as to how they should react to the film			1
by talking to ordinary people , listening to preachers in the mosques and following posts and comments on @entity83 , it seems that the mood of @entity1 can be divided into three			1
one group believes that the film is insulting and that it is their religious duty to protest against it			0
they encouraged people to protest : it was members of this group who gathered in front of the @entity98 embassy			1
the second group , despite being angry , reject violence as a means of protest			0
they view the embassy incident in @entity0 as an immoral act and believe there are ways to express anger without destroying property and plundering equipment			2
such acts , they say , contradict the teachings and principles of @entity51 -- the religion of peace and tolerance			0
members of this group are , in fact , plenty in number			0
the third group believe it was a kind of stupidity to show any reaction to the film and that it gives its producers the publicity they are looking for			0
they likened its production to terrorist attacks , through which publicity is intended more than destruction and casualties			2
thus , the best way to ensure the film will fail is to completely ignore it			0
yet still the film has triggered plenty of political disputes and arguments in @entity1 , as well as the other countries of the @entity142			1
the remnants of deposed regimes have used it as a political tool to accuse revolutionary forces of being more concerned to preserve their alliance with the @entity98 than to defend the prophet , and also allege that the @entity151 revolutions were planned and plotted by the @entity98 through its allies in the area			1
as such , they say , the region 's new governments , including that of @entity1 , are no more than puppets of the @entity98 administration			1
on the other hand , most of the revolutionaries believe the @entity98 is not to blame for the film			1
during friday prayers , one preacher in the mosque stated the film was intended to irritate @entity51 and drive their anger against @entity98 interests in the area			1
he encouraged @entity51 to be rational than emotional			0
it is an exploitation of resources , he said , for a nation to confront an individual who wants to make a hero of himself on account of @entity51 ' resentment and anger			2
@entity1 generally do not consider such an attack on the prophet as demonstrating freedom of speech , the essence of democracy			2
democracy , for them , does not justify the vilification of other beliefs , but to show respect for them			0
the @entity142 showed that when @entity1 protest , they want justice and dignity , which are the core of democratic principles			2
the @entity142 improved this situation because the @entity98 demonstrated its support for the revolutionary movement in @entity1 and other @entity151 countries			1
but @entity1 reject " democracy " such as this video , which allows the maligning of other faiths and beliefs			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity1 has witnessed protests amid anger at the video " @entity8 "
**academic** : many @entity1 are offended by the video yet differ in how they should respond
@entity207 : one preacher says the video was intended to drive anger against @entity98 interests
**academic** : remnants of deposed regimes in region have used video as a political tool
