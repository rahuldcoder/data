@entity0 , @entity1 -- the tragic death of a trainer at @entity5 last week revived a number of long simmering questions			1
while we still grapple with " how did this happen ? " the central question for many revolves around the role of large mammals -- like @entity13 the killer whale -- in zoos and aquariums : should they be there or not ? animals in zoos , aquariums and museums play an important and powerful part in our cultural and formal educational processes			1
humans are inherently interested in nature			0
we are not very far removed from a time when being knowledgeable about nature was vital to life ; you either knew how to find your dinner or you were dinner			1
today , with well over 50 percent of our populations living in cities , we are rapidly becoming divorced from the realities of the animal world			0
the dialogue we see in the media , read on blogs and hear in conversation makes it clear that many people have lots of ideas about what 's happening in our natural world , much of it not correct			1
this lack of knowledge is concerning in a world beset by environmental problems , where species are disappearing at an alarming rate			0
we need people to understand the changes taking place in our natural systems and appreciate that each of our actions has an impact			1
more interest and knowledge , not less , is essential			0
zoos and aquariums provide access and a vital connection to the world of wildlife and our environment , helping to foster an understanding of nature and how it works , and an appreciation for why it matters			1
most professionally operated zoos and aquariums , such as those accredited by the @entity77 or @entity78 @entity76 , are dedicated to increasing engagement and raising awareness and participation in conservation issues			1
they conduct active programs that aid species survival , research and conservation , both at their public display facilities and in the field			1
the @entity91 has operated our @entity94 ( @entity93 ) program since the mid 1960s			0
each year , hundreds of marine mammals are rescued from situations of distress and rehabilitated by our dedicated team of staff and volunteers , led by our veterinarian			0
their goal is to return marine mammals to good health so they can be released back to the ocean			0
the @entity91 has not had killer whales on exhibit since 2001			0
however , our orca research continues in the field with experts working off the @entity1 coast to observe and study social interaction , behaviors , migrations , and feeding patterns			0
we do have beluga whales , including two calves born recently			0
belugas are ideally suited to an aquarium environment			0
the calves ' births have allowed researchers to study the social structure of a beluga family , and in collaboration with the @entity127 we have conducted beluga vocalization studies since 2002 to understand contact calls and other forms of communication between these beautiful and communicative animals			2
as our visitors see beluga whales and learn about their communication , natural history and the challenges they face due to climate change in the @entity141 , a unique chain is created , moving from initial amazement of observing these creatures to the inspiration to care about them and finally to take action , in large or small ways , to protect their future by conserving their natural environment			2
we see our role as more important now than ever before			2
the time of simply displaying animals merely as curiosities is , thankfully , over			1
our aquarium , and many others like it , represents often the only -- and the best -- opportunity for urbanites ( particularly youth ) to establish a connection with the natural world of animals			2
sadly , many of us will never experience the joy and wonder of encountering animals in their natural habitat			2
but can get learn about them up close and personal in a modern and reputable aquarium or zoo			2
if you have had the good fortune to spend time in such an institution , and have seen the sense of awe and wonder on the faces of youngsters meeting a sea otter , for example , for the first time , you 'll know what this is all about			0
what 's more , having access to , and learning about , @entity13 and other whales in aquariums and marine parks since such amazing creatures were first displayed in the mid- 1960s , has totally changed people 's perceptions about them			1
before then , killer whales were feared , termed " wolves of the sea " , and even had a bounty on their heads in some places ; being able to see them personally helped spark people 's curiosity and interest			2
the resulting change in public perception was dramatic and swift , leading to their protection by the @entity78 government in the 1970s under the @entity209			0
today , most people revere killer whales and understand a great deal more about the challenges this species faces around the world -- with overfishing depleting their food supply , the impacts of climate change and pollution threatening their environment and their ultimate survival			0
with so many changes confronting nature and the animals that make it their home , human understanding and appreciation is critical			1
animals that people are privileged to see in professional zoos , aquariums and similar institutions are vital to engagement , inspiration and conservation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dr. @entity240 .			1

@entity240 says death of whale trainer raises questions about displaying *captive* animals
urbanization make zoos , aquariums vital to education , understanding , he says
such institutions show why preserving environments is important , he says
@entity255 : seeing creatures up close makes people more *inclined* to conservation
