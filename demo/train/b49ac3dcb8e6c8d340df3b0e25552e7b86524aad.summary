-- @entity2 lawmakers considering the closure of the controversial @entity5 detention center will probably be looking at a rehabilitation program in @entity7 that focuses on religious re-education for captured jihadists			1
@entity10 , who took part in a bombing mission in @entity13 , said he was a " wiser man " after taking part in the program			2
president @entity16 issued executive orders relating to @entity5 last week , including one requiring that the detention facility at a @entity2 @entity19 in @entity20 be closed within a year			1
now some analysts are asking not only whether intelligence agencies will be able to get the information they need to keep @entity2 safe but where the prisoners will eventually end up			1
the answer to the second part of this question may lie partly in the @entity7 rehab program that analysts in that country say has helped deal a big blow to @entity32			1
since the 2003 bombings in @entity35 that killed dozens there have been no major attacks in the kingdom , they point out			0
@entity40 is using a similar philosophy of religious re-education , moving away from brutal treatment of militants in jails , and @entity46 is also looking at it			2
the program focuses on religious re-education for young men , all in their late teens to early 30s , captured while engaged in terrorist activities			1
of the 218 people who have taken part , only nine have since been rearrested after trying to rejoin @entity32 , @entity7 officials told @entity0			1
" we have reduced the threat but can not say we have eliminated it , " said interior ministry spokesman gen. @entity56			0
" such a re-education program will help the police to make sure these people get rid of the ideology that penetrated their brains [ and to ] make sure , when they leave prison , [ they ] can lead [ a ] normal life			2
" the key to the government - run scheme 's success is the way it uses imams , or religious teachers , to explain to the young , radicalized @entity75 that not everyone can issue a fatwa			1
it tells them that what they have been taught previously is wrong : you can not just go and kill someone			0
in an @entity32 cell , one person will issue a fatwa to justify whatever violent action the group will take , but the rehabilitation program makes clear that to issue a fatwa you must be a well - trained , experienced imam			2
one young man who had been through the program said he had learned his lesson			2
@entity10 , who admitted driving a truck that exploded in @entity13 , killing 12 people , said he had been brain - washed by @entity32 militants			0
" they told me @entity2 kill @entity75 in @entity13 and @entity99 ... and they brainwash me			1
... they said it 's the honorable thing to do to go fight @entity2			1
" @entity10 said that he was just a regular muslim before he was radicalized but that the program had taught him the error of his ways , and now , " i will never think about the jihad again			1
" " my message to all young people : if you are in @entity13 , leave and come back home and ask governments and elders about religion			0
do n't do what these bad people tell you to do			0
" i used to hate @entity2			1
thank @entity119 i am a wiser man and i know right from wrong			0
in the program , they taught me killing a person -- muslim or @entity124 -- is wrong even if he gets in my way			2
you should help people , not hurt them			0
" the program came about after the @entity7 government recognized that locking up the young radicalized @entity75 and mistreating them in jail was counterproductive and served only to foment anger in the @entity133 world			1
reformed jihadists said @entity137 , for example , the @entity32 leader in @entity7 who was killed in 2004 , was angry about his treatment in jail			1
so officials realized that a better way to deal with the threat of radicalized @entity75 was to rehabilitate them			2
" it 's not easy just to take the behavior or the person with behavior or bad behavior and put him in jail , " said psychologist @entity143			0
" how about his thoughts ? how about his emotions ? that 's why we have the advisory committee to correct the cognitive things and the emotional things			0
" @entity143 said that if the program did not exist , the young men would easily revert to their old ways			0
" if we leave them , someone will take our job like the terrorists or the mujahadeen			0
... they will pass them money			0
" he said he was convinced that the program had greatly cut the number of young @entity75 traveling to @entity13 to carry out jihad			0
officials realize that it will never be 100 percent successful , and it is labor - intensive and expensive , but it may very well be among the approaches that @entity2 officials will consider as they work out how to close the @entity5 detention facility and rehabilitate the 700 or so prisoners .			1
