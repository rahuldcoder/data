it was two years ago that @entity0 , 59 , was told that he had colon cancer and had just three to six months to live			1
" they showed me my scans and said , these are the scans of a dead man , " @entity0 recalled in an interview with @entity12 's @entity11			1
" i said , ' is it curable ? ' and the doctor goes , ' we do n't use that word			0
' " though his doctor could n't cure him , he could work to keep @entity0 alive			2
" and he 's done a remarkable job of it , " @entity0 said			1
i 've never been happier			0
" some of that happiness comes from being " surrounded by people that love me and take care of me and would do anything for me , " @entity0 said			2
" that 's called happiness			0
" but part of his peace comes from his philanthropy			0
when @entity0 learned of his diagnosis , he made a promise to give away his fortune			0
he never did say how much he 's made over his many years in @entity38 , working on " @entity2 " in addition to hits like " taxi " and " @entity42			1
" but what is clear is that however much he has , he wants it to go toward animal welfare and to feed the hungry			0
" @entity46 , who is the founder of @entity47 and one of the most influential people in my life ... she came up with an almost therapy for me , where we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that i get to participate in and enjoy and have something to look forward to at the same time , " @entity0 said			1
there 's also his philanthropic organization , the @entity59 , which aids animals and has a " feeding families program that feeds 400 families a day in @entity63			0
" his passion for these causes comes from a responsibility he feels , @entity0 explained , " to speak for those who ca n't speak for themselves			0
" @entity0 was honest about how difficult his diagnosis has been -- " cancer is a horrible disease , ( and ) i am struggling with it , " he told @entity11 -- but he added that it 's also been a lesson			1
" it has been a fight ; it 's been an adventure ; it 's been an education , " @entity0 said			2
" it 's been the most amazing experience of my life			2

" @entity2 " co-creator was told he had three to six months to live
