-- one man 's trash is another man 's treasure			0
admittedly , it helps if the trash comes from one of the most famous billionaire businessmen on the planet			0
when @entity12 zipped across the @entity13 in the record - breaking time of three days , eight hours and 31 minutes , in 1986 , his magnificent powerboat was held up as the cutting edge of design			1
but almost 30 years later , the $ 2.3 million @entity16 which captured our imaginations , had been left to rot in a remote @entity20 boatyard			1
a @entity22 boat builder -- who as a teenager watched @entity12 thump across the waves in style -- has rescued the iconic powerboat from the scrapyard in an ambitious plan to restore her to former glory			1
" she looked so sorry for herself , tucked away in this boatyard , surrounded by numerous other boats rotting away in a type of nautical graveyard , " said boat builder and new owner , @entity39			1
" it was such an amazing boat and an amazing achievement -- a piece of maritime history			0
we want to restore her and bring her back to the @entity22 where she belongs			1
" @entity12 himself has backed the ambitious project , tweeting : " so many memories on @entity50 , would be great to see it back on the ocean			1
" indeed , footage of a young @entity55 speeding from @entity56 to @entity22 's @entity57 in a sleek 22 - meter powerboat , epitomized the technological spirit of the era			1
after all , this was 1986 : @entity63 had just unveiled its first laptop , the @entity62 was launching the @entity65 and @entity66 kept daring us to fly ever higher in the hit film " @entity68 "			0
yet peer inside @entity16 today , and you 'll find a sagging , faded 1980s time warp			0
" it 's like stepping back in time , " @entity39 said of the boat which had notched up just 800 hours on the clock			1
" it still has all the @entity50 livery , original charts , electronics and seats			2
" " it 's amazing just looking out the window -- a bit like sitting in the front seat in @entity88 , " he added , referring to the 1982 tv series starring @entity82 and a sci - fi car			2
after smashing the record books , @entity50 is believed to have been sold to a @entity91 sultan , whose faded coat of arms still adorns the boat			1
in 2005 it was sold again to a secret owner who " kept it in the @entity99 but rarely used it , " said @entity39			0
" the boat was towed into @entity101 where she started to degrade quite quickly			0
" work is now underway repairing the vessel which had been left languishing in a boatyard for the last eight years , with plans to test her on the open seas next month			2
@entity16 will have a new engine , fuel tank , electronic equipment and interior -- all in keeping with the original style			0
once complete , the legendary vessel will travel 2,400 kilometers to @entity39 ' boat building business , @entity116 in south west @entity117 , with plans to tour her across the country			2
the vessel had been advertised for $ 380,000 , though @entity39 declined to say how much he paid for it			0
" she could have very easily been set for the scrapyard , " he said			0
" many people had seen her , but i think a lot had been scared off by the amount of work needed			0
" @entity16 may have cemented her place in maritime history , but it was n't all smooth sailing for the record - breaking @entity13 crossing			1
@entity12 's first attempt at the @entity135 -- the award for the fastest crossing of the ocean -- ended in disaster in 1985 when @entity140 sunk off the south west coast of @entity117			1
unfortunately for @entity12 , he was denied the @entity135 after breaking two rules of the competition - stopping to refuel and using a vessel which did not have a commercial maritime purpose			1
regardless , he was showered in champagne greeted by cheering crowds upon arrival in @entity22 -- despite the pouring rain			2
today , @entity16 may be a little worse for wear			0
but much like that other 1980s icon , film @entity152 , @entity39 may soon turn back the clock on the legendary power boat .			2
