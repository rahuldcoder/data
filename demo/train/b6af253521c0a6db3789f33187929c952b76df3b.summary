@entity0 -- as @entity4 's top housing official announced sunday the details of plans to build new settlements on disputed territory , critics warned that the construction could derail upcoming @entity4 - @entity11 peace talks			1
opposition @entity4 politicians sharply criticized the announcement , which comes days before @entity4 and @entity11 negotiators are set to resume long - stalled direct talks on wednesday			1
" ( @entity4 prime minister @entity21 ) @entity20 has to decide which government he is heading , a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement , " said @entity17 , head of the @entity18 and the @entity4 opposition			1
new @entity4 settlement plan casts shadow on talks she described the plans for fresh construction as a " ' finger in the eye ' of the @entity36 , @entity37 , the @entity11 and the majority of the @entity4 people that are seeking peace			1
" finance minister @entity42 said the settlements " are not conducive " to the peace - talk process and described the move to build more units as a mistake			2
but housing minister @entity48 stood by his announcement and said the government was asking for bids from construction contractors to build more than 1,000 new settlement units			1
" the @entity4 government is lowering the cost of living in all parts of @entity4 , " he said			1
" no country in the world will accept dictates from other countries where it is allowed to build and where not to			0
" @entity4 will continue to market homes and build all over the country , he said			2
" this is the right thing to do , " he said , " both in @entity65 and economic terms			0
" @entity11 leaders criticize decision but the news that @entity4 authorities have given preliminary approval for new settlements in the @entity72 and @entity0 -- considered illegal under international law -- has angered senior @entity11 figures and prompted condemnation from @entity4 's @entity77 allies			1
the issue of @entity4 settlement - building in the occupied @entity72 and @entity0 derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010			1
@entity4 and @entity11 negotiators agreed to return to the table after intense diplomatic efforts by @entity36 secretary of state @entity85 on a visit to the region last month			1

this is more than poking us in the eye , " he said			0
" this is something absolutely unbelievable , unacceptable and something that should be condemned as soon as possible			0
" @entity98 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity100 , decried what she said was the failure of the international community to hold @entity4 accountable for its actions			2
" we are not surprised , but at the same time , we are dismayed at the @entity36 role , " she told @entity1 sunday			0
" if the @entity36 is serious about peace , it has to stop , it has to make @entity4 stop its settlement activities , it has to curb @entity4 's veracious appetite for @entity11 land and resources , and it has to tell @entity4 that it must abide by international law and the requirements of peace			1
" @entity4 's renewed plans of constructing settlements , she said , are undercutting the proposal to achieve @entity121 peace that officials have long touted : the two - state solution , which would create separate @entity4 and @entity11 states			1
" it has rendered the peace talks entirely irrelevant because it is unilaterally destroying the two - state solution , " she said , " stealing @entity11 land , building more settlements in @entity0 , and then saying it wants to talk about the two - state solution while effectively it is acting to destroy it			1
" @entity132 , an @entity4 government spokesman , said sunday that the construction would not impact peace talks			1
" how is this a problem if @entity4 is building in communities that in any way in any possible future peace agreement will stay part of @entity4 in any case ? " he said			2
" i think there 's more posturing here , there 's more spinning here , than reality			2
the truth is the way to solve all these issues is through negotiations , and we 're ready to do that			0
" a sporting push for peace @entity36 does not " accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity ' @entity157 spokeswoman @entity156 said thursday that the @entity36 had been in touch with the @entity4 government over the decision and was making its concerns known			1
" our position on settlements has not changed			0
we do not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity and oppose any efforts to legitimize settlement outposts , " she said			0
@entity156 said she had no indication that the @entity4 announcement would impact on the negotiations			2
@entity85 , she added , " has made clear that he believes both of the negotiating teams are at the table in good faith and are committed to working together to make progress			0
