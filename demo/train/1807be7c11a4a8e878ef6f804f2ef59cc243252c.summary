-- pending final approval from the @entity4 , @entity2 is preparing to provide a vaccine targeting a strain of meningitis in the wake of a campus outbreak , the school said monday			1
the @entity4 was preparing to recommend that all @entity2 undergraduates and graduate students living in dormitories receive the vaccine , the @entity11 school said in a statement			1
other members of the university community should be vaccinated if they have conditions where the spleen is compromised or immune system disorders , the statement said			0
the recommendations are still pending the review of the @entity4 's @entity24 , the @entity4 said monday			1
" pending final @entity4 approval , the university is prepared to accept these recommendations and make arrangements to provide access to this vaccine as soon as possible , " the @entity2 statement said			1
@entity2 has seen seven cases of meningitis , a potentially fatal illness , since march			2
only one vaccine exists to target meningococcal bacteria known as type @entity37 , the strain that appears responsible for the outbreak			2
this vaccine is called @entity42 and is made by @entity43			1
it has not been licensed for use in the @entity46 , but it was approved this year in @entity47 and @entity48			1
the @entity2 situation is the first outbreak of this strain since the vaccine was licensed in those countries			2
the necessary doses would need one to two months to get to @entity2 , according to @entity43 spokeswoman @entity55			1
@entity56 is manufactured in @entity57 , @entity55 said			0
the university would cover the cost of the vaccine for all students who receive it			1
two doses are required to protect individuals against this rare disease			2
@entity2 hopes to make the first two doses of the vaccine available in early december , and the second in february			1
the meningococcal vaccines already available in the @entity46 to college students would not protect them against this serogroup b bacteria			1
the university , the @entity75 @entity74 and the national @entity4 are discussing options to control the outbreak , @entity4 spokeswoman @entity73 said monday			1
before the news of the possible @entity4 recommendation on monday afternoon , @entity2 's board of trustees had met over the weekend to consider whether to offer students the vaccine on a voluntary basis			1
@entity2 sophomore @entity85 , a politics major , said in an e-mail he has n't seen a lot of serious worry or obsessive hygiene among his classmates , but he has observed " an abundance of caution when it comes to sharing drinks and food			0
" since media coverage began , the meningitis outbreak has been a hot topic of conversation , said @entity101 , a junior majoring in operations research and financial engineering			2
@entity101 and @entity85 both said they would take the vaccine if it becomes available			2
" if the vaccine is offered , i see no reason not to take it , " @entity85 said			2
" if the @entity47 and @entity48 have claimed it is safe , i have no doubt it is so			0
" steps to get the vaccine more decisions must be made before vaccinations can begin , said @entity115 , a spokeswoman for the @entity4			1
last week , the @entity117 told the @entity4 it would allow for the importation of the vaccine for this limited use , the center said			1
" we have been allowed to have the option to import the vaccine , but the decision to vaccinate has not been made , " @entity115 said			2
" we 're in discussions			0
" the final decision , which would come in concert with medical staff and university administrators , could be made sometime this week , @entity115 said			2
if the university gives a nod to the vaccine , another set of decisions will need to be made about how and when vaccinations will take place , @entity115 said			2
informed consent forms would also need to be approved before the vaccine could be offered to students , she said			1
the @entity4 is asking the @entity117 how quickly the vaccine can be imported into the @entity46 and whether it will require label changes , @entity115 said			1
what is meningitis group b ? there are two forms of meningitis : bacterial and viral			1
the bacterial form is rare in the @entity46 , and the @entity37 bacterial strains are even more rare			1
symptoms can include stiff neck , headache , fever , vomiting , rashes , sensitivity to light and confusion			0
untreated , the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment , brain damage , limb amputations and death			0
antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis " should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15 % , although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly , " according to the @entity4			1
meningitis is an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges			2
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the @entity46 , according to the @entity4			1
of those , 160 were group @entity182 " usually , when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus , it 's meningitis c , " said dr. @entity183 , professor of preventive medicine at @entity184 , in a telephone interview with @entity0			1
" this is very , very unusual			0
" @entity183 added that , in the @entity46 , group b meningitis typically strikes infants and only rarely adolescents and young adults			1
though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the @entity46 is " very elaborate , " it would be justified in this case , @entity183 said			1
" if i were around the table with the board of trustees , i would be gently encouraging them to do this			2
" no common link among cases the first reported case at @entity2 developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in march , according to the state health department			0
two months later , after several other students and one visitor had contracted the disease , an outbreak was declared			1
all have recovered except for the most recent case , a student who began experiencing symptoms november 8 and was taken to a hospital two days later , officials said			0
no common link has been identified among the cases , @entity75 health officials said			0
but five cases have the same strain , according to the department , and a sixth case is similar			0
test results on the seventh and most recent case were not yet available			0
the disease is not wholly understood			0
cases of meningococcal disease , including @entity37 , have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s			0
" nobody knows why , " @entity183 said			0
and cases sometimes occur more frequently in @entity238			0
" we 've never understood that , either			0
" the @entity75 outbreak is also puzzling			0
" why this is occurring is not clear , but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it , how to prevent further cases , " he said			0
if the @entity2 board approves , as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine			1
meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing , coughing , sharing drinks and living in close quarters , such as in dormitories , according to the health department			0
the bacteria can reside for months in the back of the throat before causing symptoms , @entity183 said			0
@entity2 's latest health advisory on the situation tells the university community that " increasing hygienic practices , and not sharing drinking glasses , eating utensils , smoking materials and other items " can help prevent the spread of the disease			0
in the meantime , classes are continuing , and so are football games			0
per a tradition dating back to the late 1800s , @entity2 will celebrate this season 's football victories over @entity280 and @entity281 with a bonfire			0
@entity0 's @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 contributed to this report .			0
