@entity0 -- the last time i talked to @entity4 , i made him promise not to become another headline			1
he did n't keep his promise			2
i learned through a headline -- along with the rest of the world -- of his death in @entity11 , apparently of an asthma attack			1
do n't become a headline			2
it was meant as a light exchange with him , after he and three other @entity20 journalists were released from captivity in @entity22			2
i had just watched him and the others in a @entity1 interview on @entity25 with @entity26 , detailing their harrowing captivity at the hands of @entity30 's forces			1
and , at the time , it seemed like a good thing to say			2
@entity20 reporter dies in @entity11 i never believed it would be one of the last conversations i would have with @entity4 , who early in my career had been my mentor and my editor and later my colleague and , i like to think , my friend			1
i am struggling with the news of his death and with the knowledge that i will never get to have another conversation			1
the news stories about his death spell out the extraordinary career that took him from @entity51 to @entity52 , from @entity53 to @entity54 , from @entity55 to @entity56			1
they tell how he worked for the @entity59 , the @entity60 , the @entity61 and , finally , the @entity20			1
they tell of the two @entity63 he won in 2004 and 2010 for his reporting from @entity66			1
they even detail his willingness to stand up to an editor to fight for his story			2
as a journalist , i know that stories are not supposed to be personal			1
they are supposed to be about the facts			2
but the fact is the death of @entity4 is personal			1
the first time i met him was in the @entity59 newsroom in @entity81			1
i already knew him by name , from his byline			2
he had just moved from @entity53 , @entity85 , and was to be my news editor			1
that day , over a cup of coffee , he asked me about stories and subject matter that i found fascinating			2
he asked what i wanted out of my career , where i wanted to go with it			2
neither of us had any idea at the time where our paths would lead , or that we would find ourselves years later standing together at a party in @entity54 talking about career paths			1
that day , in @entity81 , it was a conversation about how to tell better stories			1
i wanted to be better , and he promised to help me			2
@entity4 told me about the stories he loved writing , reading and editing			1
they were stories about people and their conditions			2
and the best stories , he told me , were full of color and context			0
those stories , he said , make a difference			0
when i asked him for an example , something i could read to better understand , he gave me a list of journalists whose work i should follow			0
what i remember most : his name was not on the list			0
during his tenure in @entity81 , he kept his word and worked with me			1
once , after a harried editing session , i asked him if he missed being a reporter			0
" every day , " he said			0
in may 2000 , the news that @entity130 correspondent @entity129 and @entity59 cameraman @entity131 were killed in an ambush in @entity133 sent shock waves through the industry			2
@entity4 knew @entity129 and @entity131			1
he was angry , upset they had put themselves in harm 's way			0
at least that 's how i remember his reaction , and i remember being confused by it			0
was n't that their job ? was n't that sometimes part of the risk ? today , i understand his reaction			0
it was the same one i had when i found out that he had he died			0
when @entity4 took a reporting job at the @entity60 , he called to tell me of the pending announcement that he was leaving the @entity59			1
i asked why he wanted to leave , though i already knew : @entity4 was a reporter , a storyteller			1
he made his first headline in 2002 , when he was shot in the back of the shoulder while leaving @entity157 's compound in @entity158			0
when the news broke , my colleagues tracked down a phone number for him in a hospital in the region			2
i was surprised that he answered the phone himself			0
he was in good spirits , and he laughed over the fact that so many people had managed to track him down half way around the world			0
" does everybody know where i am ? " he said			0
the answer : dude , you 're the headline			0
during that conversation , i reminded him of our discussion two years earlier about @entity129 and @entity131			0
you remember that ? he said , sounding surprised			0
over the years , @entity4 and i managed to stay in touch sporadically through e-mails			1
like many people , i followed his reports from @entity66 during the early days of the war			0
it was his stories about the @entity66 people that gave me the truest sense of what life was like for the millions caught up in the war			0
when i got the opportunity to go to @entity54 in 2008 to cover what would become the beginning of the end of @entity194 involvement in @entity66 , i sent @entity4 an e-mail to let him know			1
he wrote back , warning me to be careful and not to take too many risks			0
he also told me to tell great stories			0
when i got off the plane at @entity199 , among the items i carried with me was @entity4 's book " @entity202 : @entity66 's people in the @entity204			1
" not long ago , unpacking boxes after moving to @entity0 to take a job with @entity1 , i stumbled onto a picture of @entity4			1
it was taken in december 2009 at a @entity210 party in @entity54 that the @entity130 news agency hosted			1
he was smiling , with his arm around his pregnant wife			0
she had made the trip with him from their new home in @entity218			0
he was beaming as he introduced her , clearly enjoying this new chapter in his life			0
when it was revealed that the baby was due shortly before @entity66 was to hold its elections for @entity225 and prime minister , a story the world was following , i asked @entity4 what he was going to do if the delivery was late			1
overheard on @entity1 : readers weigh in on @entity232 his wife , journalist @entity233 , answered for him : the baby will be on time			1
we spent hours that night catching up , recalling assignments , colleagues and developments in our lives			0
i found out later that the @entity4 's wife gave birth to a son , @entity243 , about the same time as @entity4 was making headlines again -- this time for winning his second @entity63 for international reporting			1
i last saw @entity4 in @entity54 in 2010 at my goodbye party			1
i was wrapping up a 17 - month assignment			0
it was a bittersweet moment			0
he asked me what was next			0
i told him i did n't know			0
@entity4 gave me a throaty laugh , hugged me and said , " write well			1
" as the word spreads about his death , there will be many whose lives he influenced and , in some cases , forever changed , that will step forward			2
i am just one .			0
