-- the moment has to happen sometime in a new administration , and the @entity4 speech was it : the end of the @entity7 campaign of limitless aspiration and the acknowledgement of a presidency burdened by harsh realities and difficult choices			1
the candidate who had called the surge in the @entity16 war " reckless " was proposing a surge of his own in @entity4			1
the candidate who criticized president @entity21 's emergency spending bills for the @entity16 war could end up proposing one of his own			1
the candidate who said that defined benchmarks -- and penalties -- were necessary for @entity21 's surge to work in @entity16 provided none of his own in his speech			2
yet , in the end , there was one consistency : the candidate who called @entity4 a " war of necessity " found that , as president , he still believes it to be true			1
there was a clear subtext in the president 's speech on @entity4 : i would n't be in this awful situation if my predecessor had n't sent troops to fight the wrong war in @entity16			1
it 's awfully late in the process to jump - start this war			2
i tried to figure out some other way to approach this , driving my generals and the intelligence community to distraction for three months with all of my questions and scenarios			0
no one can actually be certain that this is going to work , given the fact that we have to depend on the previously -- and notoriously -- untrustworthy governments in @entity4 and @entity61			2
but , knowing the threats that are out there , we have no choice : " if i did not think that the security of the @entity66 and the safety of the @entity66 people were at stake in @entity4 , " @entity7 said , " i would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow			1
" but he found out that he could not			0
nor could he go the leaner troop route initially proposed by vice president @entity72			0
@entity7 himself made it clear that @entity4 is no @entity75 : after all , our enemies there were n't looking for ways to kill @entity66 at home			1
and , by specifying a clear exit ramp , he made it clear that he is n't about to get bogged down in a war , as if saying it could make it true			0
or at least convince his liberal base to support him			0
yet what he could n't escape were the comparisons that he might be morphing into a version of @entity89 : a president with a robust domestic policy agenda fighting an unpopular war at the same time			0
and you can just hear his argument : i 'm not @entity89 ; we 're not getting bogged down			0
we 're getting in fast , and , after 18 months , we 're gone			0
but , like @entity89 and @entity75 , this is now @entity7 's war			1
it 's also @entity7 's economy -- and his high unemployment , his health care bill , his deficit			1
he 's all - in			0
and now , so are we			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity104 .			2
