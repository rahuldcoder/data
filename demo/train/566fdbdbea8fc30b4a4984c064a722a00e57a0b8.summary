-- as it slowly became clear that quarterback @entity4 would not be healthy enough to play for the @entity5 this season , his teammates embraced the following rallying cry : " we 're not just a one - man team , '' they would say defensively			1
" we 've still got @entity11 players here			0
we can still win games			0
'' most of us bought in			0
why would n't we ? there was a culture of winning -- a @entity17 title , another @entity17 appearance , 12 - win seasons as a matter of habit -- and lots of players remaining who were an integral part of establishing that culture			2
look at the remaining roster : top receiver @entity28 and tight end @entity29			0
@entity30 ends @entity31 and @entity32			0
top - tier center @entity34			0
and then they lost their first 13 games of the 2011 football season , and have a chance to become just the third team in the @entity40 's modern history to finish the year without a win or a tie			1
not a one - man team ? now we know better			0
@entity4 , the @entity46 - worthy 35 - year - old quarterback , firmly established himself as the most irreplaceable player in the game this season , and did it without taking a single snap			1
some have even suggested he deserves @entity54 consideration : with him , the @entity5 are a perennial @entity17 contender , without him they 're a laughingstock			1
one player can have this kind of understandable impact in the @entity60 , where a @entity61 can leave @entity62 and reduce them from a 60 - win team to the worst team in the league			2
in the @entity60 , you 're talking about five players on the court at a time			0
nobody could have imagined this would happen in football , where @entity4 is one of 11 players , and does n't play defense or special teams			2
when the @entity76 lost @entity77 for the 2008 season , they still went 11 - 5			0
the @entity5 , who two years ago were in the middle of a debate over whether an undefeated season was possible , are now wondering if they will win a single game			2
we 've always known @entity4 is the face of the franchise ( and , to a certain extent , the entire @entity40 )			1
now we 're finding out he 's the heart , the soul , the brains ... everything			0
the @entity5 are n't just losing this season ; they 're barely competitive , enduring a season that included a nationally televised , 62 - 7 shellacking by the @entity95 in @entity96			2
" i 'm shocked , '' @entity5 guard @entity97 said recently			2
" how can you not be ? '' the @entity5 entered the season believing that @entity4 , coming off his second neck surgery , would become available sometime within the first month of the season			1
but the pain and weakness persisted in @entity4 's shoulder and arm			1
it was then determined @entity4 should undergo his third neck surgery in 19 months , a single - level anterior fusion			2
" that offense has evolved around a special guy , '' @entity110 , a veteran quarterback the @entity5 signed to replace @entity4 , told the @entity111			1
" @entity4 has a football iq that is off the charts and a physical gift as well			2
there is no way to go in there and run the offense like he does			0
'' the bottom line is this : the @entity5 were built around @entity4			1
for more than a decade , that was an understandable approach			0
the @entity5 were beacons of enduring excellence , one of the best franchises in the @entity40 and all of sports			1
but when the foundation is removed , the entire structure crumbles			0
all the @entity5 ' best players are reliant on @entity4			1
the receivers , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity28			0
the tight end , @entity29			0
the two pass rushers , @entity31 and @entity32 , do their best work when their team has a lead , and the @entity5 are n't doing that			1
meanwhile , nobody 's quite sure when and if @entity4 will return			1
he announced two weeks ago that the neck fusion was progressing and he could increase the intensity of his rehabilitation			0
it remains highly unlikely , though , that he will practice with the team the remaining three weeks of the season			0
so now it gets weirdly interesting			0
turns out the @entity5 picked the perfect year to stink			2
if they get the first pick in the draft -- and they have a two - game lead on @entity150 and @entity151 with three games remaining -- they will be in position to pick @entity155 quarterback @entity154 , by most accounts the best quarterback prospect to come out of college since @entity160 @entity159 left @entity155 and joined the @entity161 in 1983			1
not a bad deal : the @entity5 get 13 years of elite quarterbacking from @entity4 , suffer for one season , then get @entity154 for another decade or more of elite quarterbacking			1
but then the question becomes , what do the @entity5 do with @entity154 and @entity4 ? @entity169 video on @entity4 and @entity154 last week , @entity4 's father , former @entity40 quarterback @entity170 , told two different radio shows that @entity154 and @entity4 would not be able to play on the same team			1
the argument was that both would want to play right away and should play right away			0
@entity4 expects to be healthy , and @entity154 is viewed as the most @entity40 - ready quarterback to come out of college in years			1
( @entity170 backtracked on those comments one day later )			0
here 's the rub : the @entity5 have to decide whether to give @entity4 a $ 28 million option bonus in early march			1
the simplest option would be to let @entity4 leave as a free agent -- although it 's never simple when emotions are involved and it involves a transcendent civic icon			1
the other option is to pay the money and then figure things out			0
but it 's not as simple as paying the cash and then trading him			0
the bonus is due in early march			0
the league year , which would be the first opportunity for the @entity5 to make a trade , begins march 15			1
if the @entity5 wanted to trade @entity4 , it would cost them $ 28 million , plus they would take a $ 38 million cap hit ( @entity40 teams have a maximum amount to spend each year on player salaries and bonuses )			1
that 's an enormous number and would not allow them to field a competitive team			2
@entity204 fans would like to keep @entity4 for a couple of years and then transition to @entity154			1
but that 's a tough call , too			0
luck has not yet addressed the situation , but there 's reason to believe he would have no interest in sitting behind @entity4 for two or three years			1
as a first pick , he would have leverage , and could force the @entity5 to trade his pick , as was the case with @entity159 and @entity216			2
let 's say the @entity5 keep @entity4 for a year and then deal him : it 's a $ 28 million cap hit , still enormous , leaving them short of cap money to surround @entity154 with talented players			1
" we are n't close to making any decisions , '' @entity5 vice chairman @entity221 said			2
more and more , it looks like the @entity5 will have to make a clean break and move into the @entity225			2
the more immediate concern , though , is this : they just want to win a game .			0

the @entity5 have gone *winless* without injured starting quarterback @entity4
@entity4 has led the team to *unprecedented* *success* and a @entity17 championship
@entity5 will be in position to draft @entity154 if they finish with the @entity40 's worst record
@entity5 might end up with a decision to make between @entity4 and @entity154
