@entity0 -- between 1969 and 1993 , all 11 justices confirmed to the @entity3 were named by @entity5 presidents			1
now the re-election of president @entity7 promises to continue reshifting the balance of federal courts toward a more progressive stage , a legacy of judicial power that may be felt for decades			1
@entity7 has already named two justices to the top bench -- @entity15 and @entity16 -- and it is possible he might name two or more in his second term			1
" with the president re-elected , i think it 's very likely that @entity24 , the justice who 's the oldest ( at age 79 ) , will retire within the third year of a second term , leaving the president time to get another nominee in there , " said @entity19 , a top appellate attorney and @entity21 publisher			2
" other than retirement , i think -- absent health problems -- the justices are not too anxious to leave			0
they all really like their jobs , it 's a good job , and they all seem to be in great shape			0
" opinion : where @entity7 , and @entity41 , go from here federal judges serve for life , giving the president the political opportunity to shape a legacy that will long outlive his or her public service			1
besides @entity24 , three other justices are in their 70s : fellow liberal @entity53 , who is 74 ; and @entity5 appointees @entity54 and @entity56 , both 76			2
many conservative court watchers predict @entity7 will not dramatically alter his criteria for selecting judges , an approach driven in large part by political reality			1
" as the president himself said , he 'll have a lot more ' flexibility , ' so he could appoint someone who 's more of a hard left , " said @entity63 , chief counsel of the @entity64 , a conservative legal advocacy group			0
" frankly , he has already appointed a very solid , intelligent , articulate liberal in @entity16			0
@entity16 , i think , in many ways is sort of a left @entity54			0
she 's by no means in the center			0
she votes lock - step with @entity77			0
" while @entity78 control the @entity79 -- the body that must confirm all nominees -- the @entity5 minority has been successful blocking two @entity7 appeals court picks deemed to be " activist " and " radical " by the right -- @entity87 @entity86 and @entity89 @entity88			2
for its part , the current conservative - majority high court has not been shy in adding some of the hottest political and social issues onto its docket			2
this year alone , the justices tackled immigration reform , affirmative action and the blockbuster health care reform law -- a late - june majority ruling giving the president a major victory			1
and the justices in coming days are set to decide whether to hear pending appeals on same - sex marriage and voting rights enforcement by the federal government			1
15 @entity3 cases that changed @entity41 " the @entity3 and its ideological divide is really placing the @entity112 and the country in many ways at a crossroads , " said @entity109 , chief counsel of the @entity110			2
" where president @entity7 could have a big impact on the court is if one of the more conservative justices , like swing vote @entity56 or justice @entity54 -- if they retired , then president @entity7 could replace a conservative or a right - leaning moderate with a liberal justice and that would really shape the outcome of @entity3 rulings for quite a while			1
" some liberal groups have criticized the @entity7 @entity130 for being less than aggressive in his first term naming proven progressives to the federal courts -- including district , and appeals vacancies			1
the number of judicial nominations by the current president has lagged by the dozens behind recent chief executives , and those nominees have on average been four years older than those named by president @entity144 , according to @entity145 , a @entity146 expert on judicial nominations			1
but publicly , liberals say they are encouraged the courts will receive greater political attention over the next four years			0
" we look forward to working with the president on a robust justice agenda , " said @entity151 , president of the @entity152			0
" that agenda must include a renewed commitment to civil liberties and leaving a legacy of judicial appointments that support our values of fairness and equal justice under law			0
" @entity130 sources have acknowledged privately that @entity7 put judicial picks on a lower political priority in his first term , for the most part choosing what they characterize as moderate , non-ideological , non-controversial -- and confirmable -- slates of judges			1
those sources said the strategy reflected the president 's own personal views that judges should not bring sharp partisanship to their jobs , but also political reality : @entity7 did not want to be sidelined fighting culture wars over judges with @entity5 , while trying to repair the ailing economy and push health care reform			1
photos : @entity183 on the high court his supporters also blame @entity79 @entity5 for opposing many of the president 's choices , even ones @entity78 deemed well within the mainstream			0
both sides of the aisle blame the other for abandoning an unofficial 2005 @entity79 agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases			0
republicans for their part say they can not be criticized for the president being slow to bring judicial nominees to the @entity79 , and have said the rates of confirmation are consistent with previous administrations			0
@entity130 officials have emphasized diversity of the bench over hard numbers			0
@entity7 has successfully placed 72 women in the federal courts , the most ever in a single presidential term			1
it matches the number @entity144 named in his eight years from 2001 - 09			2
president @entity215 named 111 female judges in his two terms			1
from 1993 to 2017 @entity78 presidents will have served 16 of those 24 years , approaching in judicial impact what presidents @entity220 , @entity222 , @entity223 , and @entity224 did in their terms			0
" i think filling the lower court benches is going to be key , " said @entity227			0
" that 's something , much to my relief , actually , ( that ) president @entity7 has n't focused on as much this past term			1
he did get his two @entity3 nominations , which is huge , and has a great impact			2
but there 's also the long - term impact of filling the district court and the circuit - court spots , and that 's what is going to provide a deeper bench later on			2
" so we 'll see if president @entity7 decides to switch his emphasis and fill more of those judicial vacancies or continues to embrace that as a lower priority			1
" of more immediate concern to the rank - and - file federal courts : the pending $ 7 trillion " fiscal cliff " of mandatory federal tax increases and spending cuts if a budget deal is not reached by early january			1
economists fear another journey back to a recession if things are left unchanged			0
the @entity257 , in a letter obtained by @entity1 , warned a proposed 8.2 % across - the - board sequestration cut in judicial funding would be " devastating , " potentially forcing employee downsizing , and reductions in court security , even fees paid to public defenders and citizens for jury service .			0

@entity7 named two @entity3 justices in his first term
four of the current justices are in their 70s
