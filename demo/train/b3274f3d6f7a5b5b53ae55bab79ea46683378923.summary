@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 on wednesday dismissed a complaint from @entity5 about the " militarization of the @entity7 " as tensions rise regarding the @entity1 , over which the two countries fought a war 30 years ago			1
" the people of the @entity1 are @entity3 out of choice , " the @entity11 said in a statement			1
" they are free to determine their own future , and there will be no negotiations with @entity5 on sovereignty unless the @entity20 wish it			2
" it was responding to a warning from @entity5 president @entity24 that her country would file a protest at the @entity27			1
" i have instructed our chancellor to formally present before the @entity32 and the @entity33 this militarization of the @entity7 , which implies a great risk for international safety , " she said during a speech in @entity29			0
" we 're going to file a protest , " @entity36 said			0
no protest had been filed as of wednesday afternoon , @entity27 spokesman @entity39			1
speculation in recent days had been that she would cut the @entity1 air link to the @entity44 mainland by banning the airline @entity45 from using @entity5 airspace to fly to the islands from @entity48			1
the saturday flights are the only scheduled air service to the @entity1 and carry fresh food as well as passengers			2
the president made no such announcement in her speech tuesday			0
why tensions are flaring over @entity1 @entity5 already bans @entity1 ships from its ports , an action joined by other @entity44 and @entity61 nations			1
" i guess we were all kind of relieved that there was n't anything particularly concrete			0
it seems to be another burst of hot air really -- and to that degree -- we 're relieved , " said @entity67 , a journalist and @entity1 resident			0
@entity3 and @entity5 fought a war over the @entity1 , which @entity5 calls @entity1 , in 1982			1
though @entity3 won the war , expelling an @entity5 military force , @entity5 claims the territory , which has been under @entity3 rule since 1833 , as its own			1
@entity3 maintains that the 2,500 residents of the @entity1 have the right to determine their allegiance , and so far that has been staunchly @entity3			1
" the @entity3 has no doubt about our sovereignty over the @entity1			1
the principle of self - determination , as set out in the @entity83 , underlies our position , " the @entity11 said			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity87 said residents have a right to decide			2
" we support the @entity1 ' right to self - determination , and what the @entity5 have been saying recently i would argue is actually far more like colonialism , because these people want to remain @entity3 , and the @entity5 want them to do something else			1
" addressing @entity87 directly in her speech , @entity36 said : " i simply want to ask the prime minister of @entity99 to give peace a chance			0
" tensions between @entity103 and @entity29 were raised even higher this month when @entity3 sent prince @entity104 to the @entity1 as a military helicopter pilot			2
the prince 's deployment comes as @entity3 is making other moves to support its 1,700 personnel at the @entity111 military complex in the @entity1			2
" we are having what in game theory is called tit - for - tat ... i do n't see an end in sight right now , but i 'm sure that war is not the end , " @entity115 , a professor of international relations at @entity117 , said after the president 's speech			0
so why , besides supporting the @entity1 ' inhabitants , does @entity3 want to hang on to the islands ? the answer may lie in the lucrative fishing grounds around the islands as well as a growing oil drilling industry			2
@entity5 , of course , has economic interests as well , but analysts say the current standoff has much to do with internal politics			0
" the government is being squeezed from lots of different areas , so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the @entity1 issue , " said @entity135 , an expert in @entity137 politics at @entity138 in @entity139			0
" it 's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on			0
" @entity2 's @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
