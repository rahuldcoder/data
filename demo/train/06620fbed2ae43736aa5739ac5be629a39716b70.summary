-- @entity2 's dictator is still missing			1
@entity3 has not been seen in public since early september , and on friday he missed the symbolically important anniversary of the @entity6			1
this absence has fueled speculation that there is political intrigue afoot in @entity11 -- possibly even a coup			0
no one outside of @entity2 really knows what 's happening -- including , almost certainly , @entity16 's troubled $ 50 + billion - per - year intelligence bureaucracy			1
but it seems likely that the corpulent potentate , who exhibited a limp before disappearing , is recovering from some kind of physical problem			0
making a rare allusion to the young tyrant 's health , a government mouthpiece reportedly venerated @entity3 in september as a man " who keeps lighting the path for the people , like the flicker of a flame , despite suffering discomfort			1
" alas , the third supreme leader of the @entity3 dynasty , who has ruthlessly eliminated potential rivals including his own uncle , may now see eliminating calories as the more pressing necessity for regime survival			1
but the speculation and concern in @entity43 and allied capitals over the cloistering of @entity3 is noteworthy in itself			1
it reveals a lack of political intelligence of any real value on the regime			1
in turn , this lapse should remind us that inherently unstable , nuclear - armed @entity2 could someday put @entity54 into crisis without any warning			1
is @entity3 's sister in charge ? professing renewed concern , @entity2 's foreign enablers seem eager to reprise a remedy that has failed repeatedly before : six - party talks			1
that dialogue , pursued intermittently in the previous decade , was intended to eliminate @entity11 's nuclear program -- a goal to which the reclusive state agreed			0
but three separate nuclear tests showed that the talks clearly failed			0
@entity2 pocketed copious foreign aid and relief from sanctions , @entity72 got to play the diplomatic grande dame of the region , @entity71 showed up and @entity78 got ignored			1
@entity79 and @entity80 would now like a repeat performance			0
at the @entity83 last month , @entity72 foreign minister @entity82 said that " the six - party talks remain the only viable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue			2
" a week later in @entity80 , @entity71 foreign minister @entity87 met with his @entity2 counterpart and declared , " the talks today confirmed that resuming the six - party talks is possible			1
" why has @entity2 decided to talk now ? @entity43 and @entity91 have yet to take the bait , but you can rest assured that the foreign policy establishments in both towns will urge them along			1
perhaps seeking to jumpstart this encouragement , @entity2 unexpectedly sent a very senior delegation to @entity99 last week , and agreed to resume formal reconciliation talks between the two nations			1
those talks are perennially ineffective , but they are like catnip to experts convinced that @entity2 can be tamed with the right combination of words and goodies			2
there is another way to handle @entity2 , which involves putting sustained pressure on the regime			1
@entity72 always says it is willing to take this step , but in fact never does -- and never will as long as @entity72 itself is run by a cabal that is terrified of the will of its own people			0
the government that will not now tolerate the modicum of @entity72 democracy it previously agreed to in @entity122 certainly does not want freedom advancing up the @entity124 to its doorstep -- the precise outcome of a regimen of pressuring of @entity11 that @entity43 , @entity129 , and @entity91 ought to pursue			0
the blossoming freedom movement in @entity122 actually offers a guide			0
in a moving letter to his fellow @entity122 students , a young @entity72 man wrote : " looking back at us mainlanders , not only do we seldom care about @entity122 issues , we barely understand our own			0
... " we do n't know that it 's possible to ask , ' what do we want ? ' " " i understand the fear behind your courage			2
if you do n't do anything now , the day will come that you are going to be just another me			2
honestly , this is my fear too			0
" the young man 's eyes were opened forever -- made possible in part by a temporary escape from the repression and media censorship of his home			0
people like him become the fundaments of a world that is freer and safer			0
this type of liberation should come as no surprise : it is the reason that free nations broadcast uncensored news and other media into the @entity163 during the @entity164			0
these broadcasts and other cultural tools , combined with real economic , military , and political pressure , ended that conflict favorably for the side of freedom			0
so it can be with @entity2			2
@entity16 governmental broadcasting today is in irreversible collapse , but the free world can give greater support to @entity2 defectors and others who comprise a nascent uncensored media for those left behind			1
the @entity2 who have undertaken this effort on a shoestring budget over the past decade have proven its effectiveness			2
these free journalists have been effective getting information into and out of @entity2 , which is why the @entity11 regime despises and targets them			1
in turn , this creates more @entity2 whose eyes are open -- who , like the @entity72 student , now realize they should be able to ask , " what do we want ? " fundamentally , we need a policy of truth for @entity2 : @entity199 get the truth			2
grasp the truth that @entity72 will never seriously help the free world with @entity2			2
accept the truth that six - party talks would fail again			0
embrace the idea that the truth will set people free .			0
