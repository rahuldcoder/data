-- as media outlets flourish , and attention spans shrink to hashtag - sized dimensions , advertisers have had to get increasingly creative with how they deliver messages to the masses			1
many brand ambassadors have found salvation in an unexpected source : the airport			1
" the individuals that are passing through generally will have an above - average income , they 're disproportionally more likely to be carrying a smart phone or tablet , and they 're very much in a captive environment			1
they 're basically the sort of people advertisers are striving to get a hold of , " explains @entity19 , the managing director of @entity22 's @entity21 airport division			1
in july , @entity28 utilized @entity29 in @entity30 as part of their wider , ongoing " dropped " campaign			1
a " @entity34 " board was set up at @entity35 , and passengers were invited to drop their current travel plans to be shipped off to an unknown , more exotic destination instead			0
the stunt , conceived by @entity40 , coincided with tv ads and a @entity28 - branded @entity43 series			1
video : is sharing the new way to travel ? " the airport really lent itself to this campaign , " says @entity46 , creative director at @entity40			2
" people are more stressed out at the airport than at any other time , and they 're about to totally surrender to an airline			2
they 're looking for a distraction			0
for us , it 's really the perfect storm			2
" @entity34 not only attracted the attention of the national and international media , but footage from the installation garnered over 2.5 million hits on @entity43			0
@entity46 notes that airports are a gateway to travel , and for that reason seem to capture the public imagination like few other venues			2
it is for this reason , perhaps , that airport marketing campaigns are apt to go viral , adding an extra element of success			1
" when people are traveling , whether for business or leisure , they will share their experiences -- especially if it 's a memorable experience that touches them or wows them , " explains @entity71 , the global head of research and a managing partner at @entity75			1
" for that reason , campaigns that center around the airport can reach a much wider audience , one that goes beyond the physical reach of the airport itself			1

the machine was yawn - activated , and rewarded passengers who could figure out its mechanism with a free cup of coffee			0
like @entity105 , the campaign garnered thousands of @entity43 hits and @entity108 buzz			0
@entity109 , the chief creative officer at @entity110 , the firm that came up with the install , notes that the one - day interaction was relatively inexpensive , but had a big payoff			0
" @entity95 do n't have a big budget			0
we spent about $ 22,000 on development of the machine , and the seeding costs on @entity108			0
it went out to about six million followers , and just went mad , " he recalls .			0
