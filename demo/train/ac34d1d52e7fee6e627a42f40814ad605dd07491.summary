-- @entity1 , the community news sharing site , has now joined the billion - page - per - month club , having served up some 1,000,404,480 pages to almost 14 million unique visitors in january , as measured by @entity6			1
that means @entity1 , once largely seen as a geekier also - ran to @entity8 , has now handily surpassed its better - funded rival in traffic			1
@entity1 was started in 2005 by @entity11 and @entity12 as part of the inaugural class of @entity15			0
@entity16 purchased the site in october 2006 , putting @entity1 under the same corporate master as @entity19			1
@entity1 , with a staff of about 10 now , has seen an extraordinary rise in traffic -- quadrupling page views since january 2010			1
@entity1 got a traffic spike of about 30 % in traffic in august / september , due to an influx of @entity8 users responding to the the spectacular failure of @entity8 's redesign , according to @entity1 engineer @entity30			1
but much of the growth must be attributed to @entity1 's ability to retain a sense of belonging to a club , even as the site grows and grows			2
wired : reddit vs. @entity8 rivalry by the numbers while the front page is still the most popular part of the site , @entity1 also has a wide collection of " sub-reddits " dedicated to particular topics and communities , including the not - to - be missed @entity46			1
that stands for @entity48 , and is a section of the site where people who are something -- from a @entity54 technician to an @entity55 arrested in the anti-government protest -- offer to answer questions from curious users			0
@entity1 announced the milestone to its loyal and demanding userbase on wednesday in a blog post by engineer @entity62 : " there are only about 100 sites on the entire @entity65 that get a billion pageviews in a single month , and now @entity1 can put on its smoking jacket and join that exclusive club			0
" the @entity69 is n't on the membership list , nor is @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , or @entity74			0
in your face , meteorologists ! " this is an accomplishment that all @entity79 should take pride in , because people would n't keep arriving in droves -- and coming back -- if not for the community that you 've created here			0
" as a side note , i first wrote about @entity1 when they were just finished with @entity15 's summer mentorships , and @entity11 was very excited to tell me the site had more than 600 users			2
it 's safe to say the site now has plenty more than that , even as @entity11 and @entity12 , along with the site 's first employee @entity93 are now huddled together working on @entity95 , a airline ticket search site			0
@entity1 remains in capable hands , and the numerically - limited staff has done amazing work with limited resources scaling the site , even when this reporter , who sits about 15 yards away from their office , shoots foam - tipped darts at their glass door for fun			2
