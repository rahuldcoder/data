-- when i first joined the @entity2 , i had no idea that i was gay			1
i was well into my career when i realized this fact , but i was doing well as evidenced by the awards and promotions i was receiving			0
in addition , i really enjoyed what i was doing and felt i was making a difference			0
so i opted to continue to serve , even though i knew that i would have to hide my true identity			0
for most of my career in the @entity2 , i lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last			1
whenever the admiral would call me to his office , 99.9 percent of me was certain that it was to discuss an operational issue			0
but there was always that fear in the back of my mind that somehow i had been " outed , " and he was calling me to his office to tell me that i was fired			0
so many simple things that straight people take for granted could have ended my career , even a comment such as " my partner and i went to the movies last night			1
" do you think " do n't ask , do n't tell " should be reversed ? in spite of the stress of living under " do n't ask , do n't tell " and the constant fear of losing my job , somehow my partner , @entity37 , an openly gay reference librarian at the @entity39 , and i had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices			1
i had pretended to be straight and played the games most gays in the military are all too familiar with -- not daring to have a picture of @entity37 on my desk , being reluctant to go out to dinner with her , telling her not to call me at work except in a real emergency , not going to church together , avoiding shopping for groceries together and generally staying out of sight of anyone i knew when we were together			1
i did n't want to have to lie about who @entity37 was or have someone conclude that we were more than casual friends			1
but it was the events of september 11 , 2001 , that caused me to appreciate fully the true impact of " do n't ask , do n't tell " on our lives			1
at 8:30 a.m. on september 11 , i went to a meeting in the @entity67			0
at 9:30 a.m. i left that meeting			0
at 9:37 a.m. , @entity68 77 slammed into the @entity67 and destroyed the exact space i had left less than eight minutes earlier , killing seven of my colleagues			0
in the days and weeks that followed , i went to several funerals and memorial services for shipmates who had been killed			0
most of my co-workers attended these services with their spouses whose support was critical at this difficult time , yet i was forced to go alone			0
as the numbness began to wear off , it hit me how incredibly alone @entity37 would have been had i been killed			0
the military is known for how it pulls together and helps people ; we talk of the " military family , " which is a way of saying we always look after each other , especially in times of need			2
but none of that support would have been available for @entity37 , because under " @entity94 , " she could n't exist			1
in fact , @entity37 would have been one of the last people to know had i been killed , because nowhere in my paperwork or emergency contact information had i dared to list her name			2
this realization caused us to stop and reassess exactly what was most important in our lives			1
during that process , we realized that the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy was causing us to make a much bigger sacrifice than either of us had ever admitted			1
eight months later , in june 2002 , i retired after more than 29 years in the @entity2 , an organization i will always love and respect			1
we are now committed to doing everything we possibly can to get rid of " do n't ask , do n't tell " so that our military can finally be open to all qualified and motivated individuals who want to serve their country			2
as a retired naval officer , i am especially pleased with the leadership that @entity2 adm. @entity114 , chairman of the @entity115 , has demonstrated on repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" i believe that the end of the policy is in sight			2
i have every confidence that our military will easily adjust to this change and that with strong leadership , we will ultimately be stronger and better for it			0
ironically , it was in the military that i learned to work with people of different backgrounds , different religions , different ethnicities and different skin colors and to focus on getting the mission accomplished			2
i learned the importance of respecting everyone and judging people on their performance and abilities , not on a preconceived prejudice			2
twenty - six countries allow gays to serve openly in their militaries , and from all reports , things are going just fine			0
this is the right step for our country , our military and for gay people both currently serving and those who would like to be part of the world 's finest military			2
i have great love and respect for our country , but i know we can do better than " do n't ask , do n't tell			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

@entity156 says she lived two lives in the @entity2 , wondering if each day was the last
@entity156 says she pretended her partner did n't exist , that she was straight , avoided people
she says a close brush with death on 9/11 caused her to reassess life under policy
@entity156 : " i know we can do better than ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' "
