@entity18 , who also set up @entity19 's effort , could be the next @entity2 to move to the @entity30 -- he 's being linked with @entity31			0
the majority of players @entity7 used on friday ply their trade in @entity36 's top division			0
@entity7 received a further boost , guaranteed of at least second spot , when @entity39 blew an opportunity to go level on points with three matches remaining			1
despite registering nearly 20 shots , @entity39 was upset 1 - 0 by @entity45 in @entity46			1
elsewhere , @entity48 's @entity47 defeated @entity49 1 - 0 to move into top spot ahead of @entity52 's men in @entity53 @entity55 winner veteran striker @entity55 netted on a tap - in in the ninth minute in @entity57 to end @entity49 's perfect 4 - 0 record			1

@entity95 , not @entity91 , tallied for the visitor with eight minutes remaining			0
@entity90 , though , will be favored to reach 11 points next week , as it faces the @entity80			0

striker @entity126 , no stranger to controversy , was dismissed in the second half after receiving two yellow cards			2
he struck defender @entity129 in the face with a forearm to receive his marching orders			0
" @entity126 should control himself better -- he allowed himself to be provoked , " @entity123 coach @entity133 told reporters			2
" there were a couple of fouls that were not given but that 's no explanation for what he did			0
