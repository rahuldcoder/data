-- we 've seen deaths , weddings , dramatic costume changes , surprise hookups and more deaths			1
and that 's just in the past five years or so			2
the world of superhero comics has seen a lot of changes recently , with the demise -- and in some cases , resurrection - of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , professor @entity18 and the @entity19			1
@entity20 walked out on his job and dated @entity22			2
there have been revelations that multiple characters were gay , along with a same - sex wedding or two			1
( there also was a complete reboot in 2011 for @entity29 , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity30 , and a relaunch of many of @entity34 ' books in 2012			2
) so , what 's behind all these headline - grabbing plot twists in comic books these days ? we have asked some of the creators over the years			1
@entity41 , who writes " @entity42 , " including the most recent " @entity44 " story arc , said he writes stories as if this was his one chance to write about a certain character : " it 's not so much to make the books as dramatic as possible or to be shocking , but to try to tell the best story you can that feels organic			1
it 's not been a marching order ( from editors )			2
" when the @entity19 died in a 2010 issue of " @entity62 " ( only to return a year later ) , @entity34 editor @entity60 spoke to @entity0 about deaths in comics , " it 's very easy to develop cynicism about the stories we tell			1
the only way to combat and conquer it is to have a story that touches on the humanness of people that has emotional resonance and truth to it			1
the fact of death is something every human being can relate to			0
i would argue that a well - told story of a character 's demise is not necessarily undone by them coming back later			1
" we recently spoke with three comic book experts , who gave us their thoughts on this phenomenon : @entity0 : why do you think we seem to see more and more of these kinds of stories and changes in comics ? @entity90 , author / actor / comics historian : the industry 's not doing so hot			1
books are in danger of cancellation before the second issue even hits the stands			0
sales are determined by how many books retailers order rather than how many actually sell			0
for some reason , we do n't advertise comic books outside of comic books themselves			1
the tv commercial for " @entity110 " did n't really tell people why they might want to check it out if they 'd never read comics before , it just expected you to be excited and already know the gist of what was happening			1
so these headline - grabbing stories are understandable , because you want to get people talking and you want to enhance curiosity for new consumers			1
but i think it 's a wrong approach			0
does spoiling the ending of a comic in the @entity122 two days before it 's available for purchase really ensure higher sales than if you released that story on the same day or a day after it hits the stands ? i doubt it			1
and it does n't affect retailer sales because they 've already ordered the books at that point			0
we need to advertise good stories and new - reader - friendly stories			1
@entity137 , psychology professor / expert in the comic arts : declining sales have been scaring publishers for a long time			1
not just comic book publishers			1
almost 30 years have passed since @entity143 told us , " print is dead			2
" these publishers have to do something to keep this medium alive , and we want them to survive			0
we want them to thrive ! @entity150 , clinical psychologist , scientist , comic convention speaker : i do n't necessarily see an increase in incidence with regards to these comic book events in recent years , but perhaps we 're more likely to notice them now			1
these events have been going on for as long as i 've been reading comics			2
and that 's been a long time			0
the comic book industry should n't be faulted for having an equivalent to television 's " sweeps week			1
" when you need a hit , you create an event that will bring in the readers			0
@entity0 : which recent big change or story do you think had the best payoff ? @entity90 : " the death of @entity16			1
" that story actually had people mourn and move on from the event ; there was no rush to bring @entity180 ( @entity181 ) back			2
for a few years , we really got to explore what a new @entity16 would be and how the world would be different			0
when @entity180 did come back , surprise , he needed to process the whole experience rather than rush into his old role			0
on the flip side , we were told that @entity42 's " death " was n't real , then saw a former partner questing to prove he was n't dead , followed by advanced art for a miniseries called the " @entity193			2
" they were good stories , but the marketing approach and early advertising made @entity198 seem like a stand - in rather than " the new @entity42			2
" @entity150 : i strongly believe that @entity110 's " @entity208 " can be seen as a great example of a major plot shift or re-imagining of a story that required readers to let go of a long - loved character ( @entity207 ) and begin to believe in @entity208 as a new character , one who 's recovered from a life - threatening attack			1
the character essentially presented the determination , resilience and psychological strength that she needed to put the cape back on after a severe injury , just as readers were challenging her ability to represent a strong rebooted character			0
it 's as if we could relate to the weight on her shoulders , because we were a part of that process			0
@entity227 : the same - sex weddings			2
@entity230 's wedding ( in " @entity231 " ) made sense			0
these characters , in their fictional worlds , are celebrities			0
given how many celebrities made news by marrying their same - sex partners in our world once they legally could , it would have been weird for @entity34 's @entity242 not to have had a same - sex superhero wedding			2
@entity245 's wedding in " @entity246 " is important for the opposite reason , because it 's a down - to - earth relationship			1
both of those weddings reflect our times and say these characters live in worlds that remain relevant to us			0
@entity0 : do you see even more of these plot twists on the horizon , or the possibility of comic companies trying to top each other ? @entity227 : competition has value , of course			2
@entity29 and @entity34 are working really hard to find creative new ways to outdo each other , and it 's interesting to watch			0
@entity34 's growth in the 1960s challenged @entity29 and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories			0
it 's an exciting time , really			0
the comic book industry will change , but i 'm actually a lot more optimistic about its future now than i was at the start of this millennium			1
everything feels so much more alive			0
@entity277 : i see a rising impatience with this kind of headline grabbing and spoilers in the news			0
people are wondering why comics feel so insecure that they need to advertise the endings of major stories whereas everyone was happy to buy a " @entity289 " and " @entity290 " book without knowing the ending			1
@entity150 : i think risk - taking comes with a price , and readers of comics are particularly savvy when it comes to storytelling			1
but competition makes us stronger			0
these companies -- and not just the big ones , but smaller publishers , as well -- want to be known as the best			0
and that 's in the storytelling			0
so with amazing arcs and events , inevitably come happy readers .			0
