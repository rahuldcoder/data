-- with one of his first jokes at the 66th @entity4 , host @entity1 cut to the chase : " @entity6 aired the @entity7 last night			1
that 's right , @entity6 still has an award for music videos even though they no longer show music videos , " he said			0
" that 's like network tv holding an awards show and giving all the trophies to cable and @entity17			1
why would they do that ? " there was loud laughter in the auditorium -- knowing laughter , because that 's what the @entity25 have resembled in recent years : an awards show on network tv celebrating cable tv			1
during this year 's awards telecast , though , viewers could almost see the tug - of - war -- as the networks pulled off some surprising wins and @entity17 found itself shut out of the major categories			1
in fact , monday 's telecast felt at times like an elaborate commercial for network tv , interrupted ever so briefly by an actual commercial that @entity17 paid to air during the first of the three hours			1
it was a reminder that the answer to the question " what 's the future of television ? " is " all of the above			0
" when it was all over , the cable channel @entity50 , home to " @entity52 , " had picked up five emmy statues , but so had @entity55 , the broadest of the broadcast networks			2
one of @entity55 's five was awarded to @entity58 , star of " @entity59 , " in the lead actress in a drama category			0
on stage , she thanked " our writers who never cease to amaze me with 22 episodes a year " -- a jab at cable series that tend to have much shorter seasons			2
another network series , @entity70 's " @entity69 , " came away with three wins , including the outstanding comedy award for the fifth year in a row			1
television critics expressed disappointment on @entity76 -- partly because there were newer , edgier nominees like @entity17 's " @entity79 is the @entity80 " and @entity82 's " @entity81 " that deserved the prize			1
" even for the @entity25 , this is some hardcore repetition , " @entity85 's @entity84 wrote on @entity76			0
but @entity70 was understandably thrilled by all the recognition for the sitcom			0
" someone forgot to tell the voters that the networks were n't supposed to win anything , " opined @entity90 's @entity89			2
for viewers , of course , there 's hardly any network - cable tension at all			2
these days , tv fans barely distinguish between @entity70 and @entity50 and @entity100 , and they do n't have to , thanks to newfangled set - top boxes and streaming video websites			2
case in point : on monday , i watched an old episode of @entity109 's " @entity108 " on @entity17 , then the @entity25 red carpet on the cable channel @entity111 , and then the actual awards show on @entity109			1
furthermore , all of the companies that own broadcast networks also own lucrative cable channels , and in many cases the same companies also license shows to streaming services like @entity17			1
still , there is palpable tension within the television industry : some broadcast executives resent the fact that long stretches of the @entity25 -- which they take turns televising -- amount to celebrations of cable			2
the executives also point out that there are big differences between the business models of broadcast and cable , and in many ways , that favors cable			0
all of this raises a question that gets re-asked every year : can a broadcast series like " @entity141 , " on @entity142 , really compete with " true detective , " on @entity82 , or " @entity52 " ? on monday , the answer was yes , with an asterisk			0
indeed , @entity147 ' best actress win -- her second win in the category -- was all the more notable because " @entity59 " was not even nominated for best drama			0
backstage after the telecast , @entity58 said she felt very strongly that her award was " for the whole team , " for the whole show			0
other network wins included @entity157 for her supporting actress role in the new @entity55 comedy " @entity160 " and @entity161 for his lead actor role in " @entity163			0
" @entity142 's " sherlock " earned three statues , as well			0
there was something of an underdog spirit to these wins -- underscored by the joke @entity1 made upon introducing @entity171 , the @entity172 late - night star who will succeed @entity173 on @entity55 next year			1
" he 's being demoted from cable to network tv , " @entity1 quipped			1
later in the evening , @entity171 won the variety series @entity25 for his " @entity178			0
" next year , his old cable and new network shows could compete with one another in the category			1
but broadcast , cable , @entity82 , @entity17 -- viewers do n't care where the show comes from , as long as the show 's worth watching			2
and the lines between all the different versions of tv will continue to blur .			0
