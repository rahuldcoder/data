-- in 2009 , when @entity2 won the @entity3 , the @entity1 noted that he was attacked in the media and online for being " not really an @entity7 runner			1
" although the runner emigrated to the @entity7 as a 12 - year - old and has called @entity7 home ever since , @entity10 , then of @entity11 , called the " headline " that an @entity7 had won the race " empty , " and compared @entity14 to " a ringer who you hire to work a couple hours at your office so that you can win the executive softball league			1
" ( @entity10 later apologized for his comments			0
) now , winning the @entity24 a year after the bombing , a race longing for nationalist pride , @entity14 's victory was greeted with onlookers erupting in chants of " @entity7 ! @entity7 ! @entity7 ! " it was a wonderful moment			1
in its coverage of this year 's race , the @entity30 website said : " @entity14 is first @entity7 to win men 's race since 1983			1
" the story on @entity14 does n't even note that he was born in @entity37			0
a year later , runners ' take back that finish line ! ' a year ago , the finish line of the @entity24 was blown up , allegedly by two brothers , @entity42 and @entity43			1
a @entity30 story on the @entity43 brothers , written a day after their identity was learned , notes in the first paragraph that both are " from @entity58 " but just two paragraphs later , highlights their foreignness -- " ethnic @entity51 , born in the former @entity53 territory now known as @entity54 and transplanted to a working - class @entity56 neighborhood			0
" @entity2 and the @entity59 : which of them is more @entity7 ? because it turns out that while the geography of our nation is fixed , our identity is treated as malleable -- and , especially for immigrants and people of color , revocable			1
what makes someone an @entity7 ? it 's a profoundly complicated and rich question for us , our identity having been forged out of many strands -- some willingly incorporated , others against their will , over generations and generations			1
but what seems to emerge from the @entity14 / @entity43 example is the ephemeral nature of @entity7 identity			1
after all , @entity81 is a naturalized @entity7 citizen and his brother had a green card and reportedly hoped to naturalize			1
@entity2 is also a naturalized citizen of the @entity7			2
on paper , at least , @entity81 and @entity2 are the same as far as citizenship goes			0
but not in terms of fitting the popular conception of what is " an @entity7			2
" when the @entity90 were identified , the @entity89 wrote : " with their baseball hats and sauntering gaits , they appeared to friends and neighbors like ordinary @entity7 boys			2
but the @entity98 bombing suspects were refugees from another world -- the blood , rubble and dirty wars of the @entity103 , " hinting at the idea that the @entity90 resembled dangerous wolflike immigrants in sheepish @entity7 clothing			1
in a similar vein , although immigration reform advocates call our nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants " aspiring @entity7 , " conservative opponents label these moms and dads and children " criminals " who " broke the law			1
" immigrants who grew up in the @entity7 , who work day in and day out to contribute to our economy and our communities , are denied their essential @entity7 - ness			1
" not only not @entity7 , but rendered as animals			2
although @entity7 the place was forged as a safe harbor for diverse peoples from difficult backgrounds , @entity7 the identity is often treated as a ranking , a way of separating the good from the bad , the deserving from the less - than			2
who gets to be in which group often eerily tracks according to skin color			0
it 's a practice that stands in direct violation of the values that make our nation great			0
when people commit heinous acts , we try to distance ourselves from them , physically and emotionally			0
if we believe those acts were carried out by people who are nothing like us , not people like our friends and neighbors but " others , " it 's a psychological attempt at self - protection			0
but our culture teaches us to maintain our distance with nationalism , and especially racialized nationalism			0
in @entity7 , we make people we do n't like the " other , " especially people who commit evil			1
but some groups of people are more readily dismissed than others			0
i 'm not saying we should embrace the @entity43 brothers as examples of patriotic @entity7			2
but to deny their @entity7 - ness not only rejects our core values but perpetuates a dangerous blind spot about the realities of home - grown terrorism			2
according to a study by the @entity181 for the @entity182 , right - wing @entity7 terrorists -- most of whom were white @entity179 males -- perpetrated 145 ideologically motivated homicides between 1990 and 2010			2
during the same period , " @entity186 affiliates , @entity186 - inspired extremists , and secular @entity189 nationalists " committed 27 homicides in the @entity7 , " involving 16 perpetrators or groups of perpetrators			2
" still , in the moments after news broke this month of yet another shooting at @entity199 in @entity200 , before any details were known , conservative filmmaker and @entity204 contributor @entity205 tweeted , " if there is even one more act of @entity209 terrorism , it is then time for @entity7 to start slaughtering @entity194 in the street , all of them			0
" the 2014 @entity199 shooter was an @entity7 ( and not of the @entity209 faith ) -- though news reports routinely noted he was from @entity214			0
imagine someone making a remark like @entity205 's about conservative @entity179 or @entity179 in general			0
in the wake of the @entity220 bombings , @entity217 was called many things			0
but was his @entity7 identity stripped away ? to the contrary , an autobiography about @entity217 is called " the @entity225			1
" for people of color and immigrants in the @entity7 , the grasp on @entity7 identity can be tenuous and temporary			1
consider the black man whose citizenship and @entity7 - ness were routinely questioned even after he was elected @entity233			0
@entity2 's victory in the @entity24 conjured up a sense of national belonging to which all parts of @entity7 should be entitled -- in our moments of victory , and our moments of defeat or worse			1
rep. @entity243 once said , " @entity7 is more than just a place			0
" yes , and that idea -- that identity -- must never be allowed to flicker with discrimination or hate .			0

@entity251 : @entity24 winner was rightly described as " an @entity7 "
@entity251 : often the term " @entity7 " is used to show *approval* , and *withheld* to *marginalize* people
@entity251 : people of color and immigrants are particularly likely to be stripped of @entity7 label
being @entity7 is not revocable and not *conditional* , she says
