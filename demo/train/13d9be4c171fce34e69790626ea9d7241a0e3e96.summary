@entity0 -- manhattan district attorney @entity4 will not recuse himself from prosecuting the case against former @entity7 chief @entity6 for the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper , his spokeswoman said wednesday			1
" any suggestion that this office should be recused is wholly without merit , " @entity10 said in a statement			1
the announcement came in response to the call earlier in the day from an attorney for the housekeeper			2
" we make this request in order to protect the integrity of the prosecution of mr. @entity27 , to ensure the victim 's rights are not further prejudiced by deliberate acts seeking to undermine her credibility , to insulate your office from the appearance of conflict of interest , and to ensure that future victims of sex crimes , regardless of their backgrounds , are not dissuaded from coming forward , " wrote @entity20 in a four - page letter to @entity4			2
is accused of having attempted to rape the maid when she entered his suite at the @entity42 off @entity43 on may 14 in order to clean it			0
@entity20 said @entity4 's office " apparently has been responsible " for leaks to the news media " that were intended to discredit the victim 's character and , perhaps most importantly , undermine her charges against mr. @entity6			1
" he cited a telephone call he received june 30 from chief assistant district attorney @entity52 , informing him of the prosecutor 's decision to turn over to the defense " certain false statements " that the victim had told investigators			1
during the call , he said @entity52 had told him about an audio recording obtained by the prosecution in which the alleged victim told an incarcerated person a day after the alleged attack " about the possible benefits " of pursuing charges against @entity6			1
" when i asked mr. @entity52 specifically about what the victim had allegedly said during that conversation , he stated that the victim said ' words to the effect ' that ' this guy has a lot of money			0
i know what i 'm doing			0
' " @entity20 said that @entity52 then agreed to turn over a copy of the recording or allow him and the housekeeper to listen to it but , more than six days later , had failed to do so			0
" i am told by mr. @entity52 that the victim must now wait for the prosecutor 's interpreter to prepare a complete transcript of it , " @entity20 wrote			2
he went on to complain that , within a few hours of that call , the @entity85 reported on the " alleged conversation with the incarcerated individual , " in an article that cited " ' two well - placed law enforcement officials			0
' " @entity20 said he believes those officials work for @entity4			0
the lawyer said he was troubled by the fact that , the following day , the newspaper ran another article about the alleged victim that described the reported conversation between the woman and the incarcerated individual			0
@entity20 said the article used language similar to that which @entity52 had used during their conversation			0
" such apparent leaks by members of your office is , without question , an abrogation of the duties and responsibilities of a prosecutor and will , unfortunately , have a chilling effect on other victims of sex crimes coming forward in the future for fear of reprisals from the office that is charged with protecting victims -- not discrediting them through orchestrated media campaigns , " he wrote			0
@entity20 added that he was " truly saddened " to read the response of a " senior prosecutor " who was asked about a @entity128 article that asked whether the victim was " turning tricks while at ( a ) hotel " after the alleged sexual assault and under the protection of the @entity134			0
" i ca n't say with 100 % certainty that it 's not true , " the " senior prosecutor " was quoted as saying			2
" the fact that apparently a prosecutor in your office suggested that it might be true that the victim is a prostitute and had engaged in acts of prostitution while under the protection of your office is appalling , " @entity20 wrote			0
he then pointed to what he said represents a potential conflict of interest that the prosecutor 's office has in the case -- " the chief of your entire trial division is married to one of mr. @entity6 's lawyers in this case			1
" and he blamed the prosecution for failing to have alerted him before he learned of it from the news media			0
" as far as we know , this prosecutor is still assigned to the case and gives us great concern about whether your office can truly determine what is in the interest of justice			2
" @entity4 's spokeswoman 's response did not address each of the concerns raised by @entity20			1
it said , " we strongly disagree with how the office and the work of the assistant district attorneys have been characterized			2
" also wednesday , attorneys for @entity6 said that the defense team had a " constructive meeting " with prosecutors , who maintained that they are not ready to drop sexual abuse and attempted rape charges even after questions were raised about the accuser 's credibility			1
" the investigative process is continuing , and no decisions have been made , " said @entity10 spokeswoman @entity10			2
the two - hour meeting came just days after prosecutors disclosed credibility issues regarding the hotel maid who accused @entity6 of sexually attacking her			1
" we had a constructive meeting today with ( @entity4 ) and his colleagues , " said a statement from @entity196 and @entity197			1
@entity6 pleaded not guilty in june to charges that prompted him to resign from his post as managing director of the @entity7			1
questions about the case surfaced last week when @entity4 indicated that the woman , 32 , had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack at the @entity42 hotel may 14			2
legal analysts suggest that prosecutors are looking for ways to salvage the case			1
" prosecutors correctly regard dismissal as complete humiliation and capitulation , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity215			0
" if they can get a guilty plea , even to a misdemeanor , that would be a slightly face - saving route out of this case			0
" but it seems clear that the defense now very much has the upper hand , " he added			0
the developments in @entity0 come as @entity6 faces separate accusations of attempted rape in @entity232 , which were filed in a complaint by @entity232 writer @entity234			1
a @entity6 lawyer in @entity232 said he has filed a counter-claim against @entity237 for " false declarations			1
" @entity232 prosecutors have received @entity234 's complaint , a spokeswoman for the office said , and it is currently " under consideration " to determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges			1
@entity234 's mother , @entity249 politician @entity248 , said shortly after the housekeeper 's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by @entity6 in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him			1
the statute of limitations in @entity232 for attempted rape is 10 years			2
@entity248 , a member of parliament , said she cautioned @entity234 not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career			0
@entity1 's @entity262 contributed to this report .			0
