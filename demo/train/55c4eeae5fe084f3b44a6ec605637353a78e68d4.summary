-- in @entity2 , there is an old saying : " an uninvited guest is worse than a @entity8 , " referring to the country 's medieval invaders from the @entity6			2
although @entity11 's lawyer calls him " the most wanted man on the planet , " it 's clear that @entity2 's president , @entity14 , would rather he were just about anywhere else			1
after five weeks in @entity19 's transit zone , the @entity17 leaker was allowed to leave on thursday under a grant of temporary asylum valid for one year			0
a taxi spirited him to an undisclosed @entity25 location , where @entity14 's @entity26 will undoubtedly be watching him closely			2
to some in the @entity29 , @entity11 's @entity19 escapade seems to have @entity14 written all over it			1
the @entity2 president , who once compared the @entity29 's behavior abroad to that of the @entity34 , seems to rarely miss an opportunity to score points at @entity38 's expense			1
yet the reality is that @entity14 did not seek out this problem , and now that his agents have presumably debriefed @entity11 , he would much prefer for it to disappear			1
@entity11 was -- and remains -- an uninvited guest			2
@entity2 's intelligence agencies did not lure the @entity17 contractor to @entity25			2
it is not even clear how much they will have learned from him			0
@entity2 intelligence must have known already that the @entity17 was comprehensively monitoring telephone and internet traffic			2
@entity14 , who has never shown a soft spot for whistle - blowers and civil libertarians , is certainly not sheltering @entity11 on humanitarian grounds			1
as a former @entity57 colonel , he understands the @entity29 intelligence community 's desire to get the leaker back			2
he can not extradite @entity11 to the @entity29 without looking subservient			1
at the same time , he has no real interest in further damaging relations with @entity38			0
that might seem strange given the angry rhetoric that regularly issues from @entity25 , in particular from the @entity65 , where @entity14 's @entity67 party dominates			2
just in december , @entity14 signed a bill banning the adoption of @entity2 orphans by @entity29			1
however , @entity71 has always been a complicated game for the @entity2 president			0
on the one hand , it plays well in the provinces			0
since december 2011 , when @entity25 's boulevards erupted into protest , @entity14 has faced the most serious political challenge of his career			0
having lost the support of sophisticated urbanites , his priority has been to shore up his provincial base			0
one key strategy has been to appeal to more traditional and nationalist constituencies			0
@entity87 operatives attempt to discredit @entity14 's critics by portraying them as stooges for an interventionist @entity38 that seeks to interfere in @entity2 domestic life			1
in 2007 , @entity14 compared his opponents to " jackals , " scrounging around outside foreign embassies for handouts			0
although exploiting xenophobia may seem crude , it works with some segments of the population			0
@entity14 wins widespread credit for standing up for @entity2 's rights and restoring the country 's position in the world			1
still , while insisting on @entity2 sovereignty , @entity14 loses the aura of a skilled statesman if his policies provoke genuine crises			1
behind the scenes , and even in public , he has sought accommodation on certain international issues			1
@entity14 , the anti-american in chief , personally faced down communist protesters to permit @entity116 to build a transit hub in the city of @entity119			2
some in @entity38 have urged president @entity120 to skip the @entity122 summit in @entity123 in september			0
sen. @entity124 even suggested boycotting the @entity125			0
@entity14 would clearly like to avoid such snubs			0
but were they to occur , he would cast them as yet another show of @entity29 arrogance , a slap in the face not for him personally but for @entity2			1
assuming the leaders of @entity135 countries -- where many sympathize with @entity11 -- do come to @entity123 , the final impression produced by @entity120 's empty chair might be less of @entity2 humiliation than of @entity29 isolation			1
for this and other reasons , the @entity140 would probably also prefer to move beyond the @entity11 issue			0
the @entity29 public appears ambivalent at this point , uncomfortable about both @entity11 's law - breaking and the scope of government snooping			1
yet the longer the issue remains in the public eye , the more embarrassing it is likely to become for the administration			0
for a @entity29 attorney general to have to guarantee that a suspect would not be tortured if returned shows how much has changed over the past 12 years			0
the more officials turn out to have " misspoken " in denying existing surveillance programs , the lower trust in government is likely to sink			0
at the same time , the @entity29 has a broader agenda on which it needs to negotiate with @entity25			0
although odds of a breakthrough are low , a joint @entity29 - @entity2 peace conference is supposed to take place in @entity165 this fall			1
the @entity167 and @entity168 nuclear programs remain urgent challenges			0
on these and other issues , @entity2 's @entity171 seat makes it a crucial player			2
through 2014 , as @entity29 troops withdraw from @entity175 , the @entity116 transport route across @entity2 territory will remain important			1
if secretary of state @entity179 's latest attempt to revive @entity6 peace talks is to bear fruit , the @entity29 will at least need to persuade @entity2 not to become a spoiler			1
finally , even on @entity11 , the @entity140 may not want to push the @entity2 too far			1
as @entity183 , director of the @entity2 and @entity184 at the @entity185 , points out , the @entity29 could do worse than to have @entity11 remain -- under tight control -- in @entity25			1
if @entity14 honors his pledge to stop @entity11 harming what @entity14 called his " @entity29 partners , " then at least further leaks will be prevented			1
were the @entity2 in frustration to put their uninvited guest on a plane to @entity194 or @entity195 , the next morning 's newspapers might contain additional revelations			2
follow @entity198 on @entity199 join the conversation on @entity201 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity204 says @entity14 often takes anti-american stances to shore up his support
he writes that the @entity11 affair has put @entity14 in a *difficult* bind
he says @entity14 ca **n't** be seen to be subservient to @entity29 but does **n't** want a fight
@entity204 : @entity29 needs @entity2 support on some key international issues
