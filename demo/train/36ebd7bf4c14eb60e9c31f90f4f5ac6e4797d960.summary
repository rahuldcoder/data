the slaying of prominent @entity2 critic @entity1 in the heart of @entity4 has shocked @entity6 and the wider world			1
his murder , two days before a planned opposition march , has also outraged fellow opposition figures and prompted a slew of speculation over who could be behind it			2
some government critics pointed fingers in the direction of president @entity18 or one of his supporters			1
state media reported @entity1 had received threats linked to his stance on the @entity24 attack in @entity25			1
the @entity2 suggested @entity1 may have been killed by enemies of @entity6 intent on creating political discord			1
the leader of @entity6 's @entity30 similarly blamed anti-russian " provocation , " according to the official news agency @entity31			2
so who was @entity1 ? and how did he make so many enemies ? @entity1 , 55 , was a top official with the @entity35 of @entity6 / @entity36 , a liberal opposition group			1
he had been arrested several times for speaking against @entity18 's government			1
the most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against @entity18			1
he had most recently been critical of the @entity2 's handling of the @entity45 crisis			1
opposition leader @entity46 said his friend had been working on a report about @entity6 troops and their involvement in @entity45			1
in a blog entry , published on the website of radio station @entity53 , @entity1 wrote last weekend that the @entity2 now accused him of being behind the protests in @entity56 's @entity55 , or @entity57 , which led to the ouster of @entity45 's @entity60 president @entity59			1
he posted a picture from an " @entity68 " protest held in @entity4 which showed a marcher holding a sign with his face under the words " @entity55 organizer			0
" " the @entity2 has changed its concept , " @entity1 wrote			1
" it used to say it 's the @entity70 who organized the @entity55 , and now they say it 's me			0
" in a hard - hitting interview conducted only hours before his death with @entity75 , @entity1 said @entity6 was " drowning " under @entity18 's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state			1
" due to the policy of @entity18 , a country with unparalleled potential is sinking , an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing , " he said			1
" this government wades into a costly , fratricidal war in @entity45 and into pointless confrontation with the @entity87			1
we all feel the effects of this insane policy			2
" @entity1 accused @entity18 of using " @entity93 - style propaganda " -- a reference to @entity96 's propaganda minister @entity93 -- to brainwash his fellow countrymen			1
one element of this was to implant them " with a virus of inferiority complex towards the @entity87 , the belief that the only thing we can do to amaze the world is use force , violence and aggression , " @entity1 said			1
@entity18 has condemned @entity1 's murder and ordered a swift investigation			1
the @entity2 has denied direct involvement in the conflict in eastern @entity45			1
@entity1 was also known for -- and may have made enemies from -- his anti-corruption stance			1
early in his career , @entity1 won praise for his efforts as governor of @entity119 , a large city and major economic hub			1
@entity1 was also a vocal critic of the @entity122 held in @entity123 , calling them one of the most " outrageous swindles " in recent @entity6 history			1
in a 2013 report , he questioned where $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion had gone , saying preparations for the @entity129 had been characterized by " embezzlement " and " unprecedented corruption			0
" in a restaurant interview with @entity5 's @entity133 last year , @entity1 lamented the situation for business owners			1
" this is a country of corruption			0
and if you have business , you are in a very unsafe situation			0
everybody can press you and destroy your business			0
that 's it , " @entity1 said			1
in the same interview , he did offer a hint of optimism			0
" this is my country			0
the @entity6 people are in bit of trouble			0
@entity6 court does n't work			0
@entity6 education decline every year			0
i believe that @entity6 has a chance to be free			0
it 's difficult , but we must do it , " he said			0
in a statement after his death , @entity159 secretary of state @entity158 said @entity1 had always worked toward a more democratic and prosperous @entity6			1
" in every post , he sought to reform and open @entity6 , and to empower the @entity6 people to have a greater say in the life of their country , " he said			0
years before he became a key opposition leader , @entity1 served as deputy prime minister under former president @entity168 , the first @entity169 president			1
back in the 1990s , he was a high - flier bound for greater things			0
but he lost out in the struggle to succeed @entity168 and had been marginalized since @entity18 was elected , said @entity173 , author of " @entity174 " and a @entity176 reporter			1
" he was a person who had been fierce in his criticism of @entity18			1
he 'd clearly gotten under @entity18 's skin on a number of occasions			2
a number of people had become his enemies , " @entity173 said			0
@entity173 said @entity1 tried to work with @entity18 's regime at first but soon switched to the opposition			1
" history will remember him as someone who took chances , who risked his life literally to speak out in a country where speaking out is not encouraged , to say the least , " @entity173 said			0
opinion : @entity1 killing : a chilling historical parallel ? @entity1 was a man who impressed many who met him with his energy and passion for his homeland			2
sir @entity199 , a former @entity200 ambassador to @entity6 , told @entity5 that @entity1 , whom he knew personally in the 1990s , was a " genuine @entity6 patriot " who opposed what the @entity2 had come to stand for			2
" he was enthusiastic , he was engaging , i think he was always true to his beliefs , he did n't take himself over-seriously , but he did his best to promote liberal reform then , and he had been before a very successful mayor of one of the central towns , @entity119			0
" former @entity159 ambassador @entity208 paid tribute to @entity1 " as a real patriot , who believed in the possibility of @entity6 's greatness " and said he wept for both @entity1 's family and the country he loved			2
" politics aside , he was always a loyal , loving friend of mine for 20 years			0
we all will miss him dearly , " he said			0
@entity18 , in a telegram to @entity1 's mother @entity220 , also paid tribute to @entity1 's integrity			1
" @entity1 , left his mark on the history of @entity6 , in politics and public life			2
he worked on important positions in the difficult transition period for our country			0
he always openly and honestly stated his position , defended his point of view , " he said			0
@entity18 vowed that her son 's killers would be " properly punished			2
" @entity1 's death has shocked @entity6 , but it may not have come as a total surprise			2
@entity1 acknowledged in an interview with @entity6 newspaper @entity240 this month that he was " a little bit " afraid that his mother 's fear -- that @entity18 would have him killed -- would come true			1
but , he added , " i 'm not afraid of him that much			0
if i was afraid i would n't be heading an opposition party and do what i 'm doing			2
" @entity1 's lawyer @entity247 told @entity6 media that @entity1 's life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks			2
but he did n't walk around with bodyguards , noted @entity252 , a contributing writer to the @entity253 who has covered @entity6 politics extensively			0
" it was a very overt message of bravery , " @entity252 told @entity5 's " @entity258			0
" " what we 've seen in return is a very overt message of fear			0
people in the opposition will not believe anything that comes out of the @entity2 in terms of who did this			0
they perceive this as a message directly sent to them			0
when you see @entity1 's body lying with the @entity2 as a backdrop , they understand that 's a message directed to them			2
" in his final @entity75 interview , @entity1 spoke of the need for " an alternative vision , a different idea of @entity6			2
our idea is the one of a democratic and open @entity6			0
a country which is not applying bandit methods to its own citizens and neighbors			0
" crowds mourn @entity1 @entity5 's @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			2
