-- politicians are running for office again			0
despite our best efforts , there is nothing we can do stop them			0
tuesday there will be an election			2
here are 10 things to look for as the election returns come in : 1			2
did voters choose the least recent of two evils ? to adapt a quote often borrowed by my friend , @entity16 , @entity14 said that when faced with a choice between two evils , she usually picked the one she had not tried lately			2
if @entity19 win , even by large margins tuesday night , was it only because they were a less recent evil ? will the @entity19 get the message that they are not being embraced for who they are but only given a shot because who they are not ? if @entity19 do n't get that message , they can write off 2016			1
the " war on women " distraction : @entity32 writes that president @entity40 's " commitment to a more powerful government at home and abdication of @entity38 leadership around the world is being exposed as a historic calamity			1
" whether you agree with @entity32 or not , it is hard to dispute that @entity38 's challenges are overwhelming @entity38 leadership			0
under @entity48 ' watch , polls show that most @entity38 believe our economy has fossilized like an @entity52 mummy			1
the @entity56 has caught on fire , @entity55 has grown from jv team to @entity60 contender , @entity54 's @entity53 strides the @entity61 unchecked , @entity62 turns out to be @entity63 and @entity64 is threatening to become a pandemic			0
yet , the @entity48 theme this cycle is that a @entity19 dominated by old , white men does not understand the concerns of modern women			1
seriously ? is this obvious distraction the best the @entity48 can do ? who would have thought that , when the world is burning down , it would be @entity48 advising women not to worry their pretty little heads about anything other than gender issues ? tuesday night , we will learn whether the @entity48 campaign was too small for the times , insulting and demeaning			1
will tuesday night empower @entity82 ? on @entity83 , count the number of @entity48 in swing or purple states who lose their @entity89 seats			1
an untold story in @entity91 is that @entity48 , like @entity19 , are becoming a much less moderate party			1
it is unlikely the @entity48 base will react to @entity89 losses by calling for moderation instead of purity : fewer moderates means that extreme elements in the @entity48 base will be able to raise an even larger voice			1
losses in purple states such as @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 will empower @entity108 's shrill populism			0
wednesday morning , @entity109 may have to apologize for apologizing for saying that " businesses do n't create jobs			0
does success divide @entity19 ? republicans have been split between establishment types , libertarians , neo-isolationists , tea party supporters , social issue conservatives and a small group that fears trigonometry			1
one man has brought them all together , however : @entity40			0
who would have thought that , if only in this perverse way , @entity40 would succeed @entity124 as a uniter and not a divider ? no @entity19 faction will be credited for tuesday night 's victories or blamed for defeats because @entity19 actually are , if only temporarily , united			1
instead , the @entity19 's challenge will be to hold these factions together if @entity19 gain a majority in the @entity89			1
tuesday night , if @entity19 such as @entity134 are talking about repealing @entity62 or social issues , they are inviting division			1
if , instead , they explain that this election has given them an opportunity to lead an economic renewal , it will be a sign that @entity19 are trying to hold the party together and have actually smartened up a bit			1
does defeat kick off @entity144 within the @entity48 ? @entity145 is all that is left of a @entity48 that once had a sense of humor , declared " the era of big government is over " and understood we have to create prosperity before we share it			1
the party 's base , however , enjoys none of these fine qualities			0
its heart beats with @entity108 's populism and @entity40 's post-clinton liberalism			0
tuesday night , look to see who blames whom for @entity48 losses , and keep an especially sharp eye on pro-growth , pro-business @entity48 and big @entity48 contributors			1
will they engage in any serious self - reflection ? if @entity48 only blame the consumer ( voters ) or the marketers ( the consultants ) instead of the team who made the product ( @entity40 , sen. @entity175 , @entity108 , et al			1
) , they are whistling past the graveyard			0
new @entity48 need to start a war and pull their party back to the center for 2016			1
does @entity40 's presidency effectively end tuesday night ? recently , when we 've seen someone wearing a hazmat suit on the news , it may have been a medical professional protecting us from @entity64			0
or , it could have been a @entity48 candidate trying to protect themselves from a presidential visit			1
president @entity40 has deluded himself that he is not a plague upon @entity48 candidates but tuesday evening , two @entity190 states may set him straight			1
if @entity19 win early on the @entity190 , in tight races such as @entity105 and @entity106 , denial will no longer be an option and the president may be put in quarantine			1
with a bad night in these states , @entity199 may have a better chance of getting invited to speak at the 2016 @entity48 convention than @entity40			1
why does that matter ? because politicians with huge egos rarely fade gracefully from public view , especially while still in office			0
@entity40 is the man who said , " i 'm @entity207 baby , " told us his policies were " on the ballot " and made sure this midterm election was all about him			2
a president without the support of his country , caged in his own @entity217 , bouncing off the walls like a wounded animal , can do great damage to his party and his country			0
tuesday night will shape @entity40 's final two years			0
has the @entity19 seen its future ? the most important race for republicans tuesday night will be the @entity89 race in @entity104 , where the next generation of @entity19 has been born			1
@entity227 , a sunny , optimistic , self - declared " new kind of @entity19 , " may show his @entity19 companions how they can seize the future if they are more than the grumpy old party of " no " and explain how their principles can renew our economy and our country			2
in @entity227 , @entity19 may see the difference between a merely acceptable and a desirable alternative to today 's @entity48			1
watch this state to see what the @entity19 can be			2
is the @entity48 turnout machine still the difference ? in states such as @entity106 and @entity243 , @entity48 have a home field advantage : big , urban areas with large concentrations of targetable voters			1
we should get a good read on the power of the @entity48 turnout machines in the @entity106 and @entity89 races			2
if sen. @entity253 hangs on in @entity106 , credit the @entity48 ground game			2
alert for @entity19 : there is no reason your adversaries ca n't squeeze two or three extra points out of their superior ground game not only this cycle , but in 2016			1
my bet ? @entity253 is trapped with about 45 % of the vote and 3 points from a superior ground game wo n't be quite enough			0
but this is one of the closest races to watch tuesday evening			0
is demography destiny ? the @entity48 is building its future on demography , not ideas			2
short - term , their strategy is to turn around elections they might otherwise lose by driving minority and youth turnout to above average levels			0
long - term , they hope to build an " emerging majority " as their targeted groups become larger parts of the electorate			0
all this , of course , requires that @entity48 remain the overwhelming preference of minority and younger voters			1
any cracks in these elemental building blocks of the @entity40 coalition would not augur well for @entity48 strategy , long term			2
tuesday night , however , will we see new fissures here ? when first elected , @entity40 's messianic candidacy brought masses of rapturous millennials to the @entity48			2
now they find themselves in a stagnant economy , bearing massive student debt , living in their parents ' basements , facing decades of work to pay for debt racked up by their profligate elders and for their parents ' retirement			0
the higher you lift someone 's hope and dreams , the further they may fall			0
now , millennial voters are up for grabs			2
tuesday will give us a glimpse into the future of the @entity48 's " emerging majority			2
is tuesday night 's big loser @entity91 ? for years , both @entity19 and @entity48 have found electoral success promising solutions from @entity91 : " @entity330 , the " @entity331 that @entity332 " and the ever - popular " @entity333 for the job you do n't have @entity330			1
" tuesday night will measure the breadth of the chasm between what @entity91 promises and what voters actually see it deliver			0
if @entity19 sen. @entity342 loses in @entity343 , we will know that heartland @entity38 's patience with @entity91 has been exhausted			2
@entity91 's currency is its ability to promise			0
that currency has been immensely devalued			0
what happens when @entity38 are no longer willing to accept it in exchange for their votes ? we may have reached a tipping point where voters look at promising @entity91 politicians and say , " the emperor has no clothes			0
" and that 's the good news for perhaps , at that point , real change will become possible			0
and for political junkies wondering what to do after this election , the 2016 presidential campaign will be starting right after this commercial break			0
we ca n't stop them either			0
join us on @entity367 / @entity366 .			0

@entity369 : whether we like it or not , here come the election results
@entity369 : if @entity19 does well , is it because voters like its message ? or just think @entity48 are worse ?
he asks : will @entity48 see their troubles as a reason to change course ?
@entity369 : was it a mistake for @entity48 to run on the " war on women " ?
