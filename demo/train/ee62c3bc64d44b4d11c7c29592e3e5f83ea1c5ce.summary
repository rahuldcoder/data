-- when you think of iconic tennis venues , top of the list are @entity6 's sprawling @entity5 , the green grass of traditional @entity8 in @entity9 and the rusty red clay of chic @entity11 in @entity12			1
but next month some of the sport 's top players will grace a new stage : the glittering $ 1.2 billion @entity16 in @entity17 , which hosts @entity18 next year			1
@entity20 star @entity19 plays glamorous @entity22 ace @entity21 in a battle of world number ones present and past , while @entity26 - based @entity25 takes on fellow big - serving @entity20 @entity27 in the men 's match - up			1
@entity25 , who lives in @entity30 300 kilometers away , is excited by the prospect of being able to take the freeway to a tournament , as well as his sport breaking new ground in the hot - bed of gridiron			1
he will be action on july 10 , just six days after the men 's final at @entity8 in @entity41 , where last year he lost an epic title match to @entity44			2
" i can drive there			0
with my friends from home , we might just make a weekend of it and have some fun , " @entity25 said when the @entity26 event was announced			2
" i think it will be cool			0
i do n't know if we 're going to fill it , but tennis getting into kind of mainstream venues like that more often is a good thing			0
selfishly , i like it			0
" @entity25 's fears over filling the 80,000 - seater stadium -- which will expand to around 100,000 for the @entity60 -- are probably misplaced as the matches will be played across one of the end zones			1
the configuration will mean a seating capacity of 20,000 , but still one of the biggest audiences for a tennis event			1
the biggest capacity at a regular tournament is 23,200 for the @entity71 at @entity5 during the @entity72			0
the center court at @entity8 can take 15,000 spectators , and all four players in the @entity17 exhibition will be hoping to be involved in the finals of the grass - court grand slam the weekend before			0
@entity19 took the women 's singles title last year and @entity21 won in 2004 , while @entity25 suffered a heartbreaking five - set loss to @entity44 last year			1
for the @entity84 and owner @entity85 , it is another string to the bow of their new state - of - the - art stadium			1
it has already hosted soccer , this year 's @entity93 all - star game and world title boxing as @entity96 sensation @entity95 beat @entity98 's @entity97 earlier this year			0
" we have seen the flexibility our new stadium has for holding spectacular events of all kinds , and this event should be like no other , " @entity85 said			0
" being able to attract some of the best tennis players in the world under one roof for a night like this will be something special			0
" filling big stadiums for tennis one - offs looks set to become a regular feature on the calendar for the world 's elite players			2
just two days before the @entity17 exhibition , @entity118 rivals @entity119 and @entity120 will be looking to break a world record in a battle between two former top - ranked stars in the 40,000 - capacity @entity125 in @entity127			1
it is an attempt to break the record crowd of 30,492 that assembled for the legendary " @entity131 " match between @entity133 and @entity134 at the @entity135 in @entity26 in 1973			0
" @entity137 " match is expected to easily surpass that attendance , but maybe @entity16 will wrest the honor back for the lone star state in the future .			2

tennis breaks new ground with glittering exhibition in @entity84 ' @entity147 stadium
@entity19 will play @entity21 and @entity25 takes on @entity27
@entity16 , which will host the @entity18 , will be reduced to 20,000 capacity
@entity152 's @entity125 hopes to set attendance record for tennis two days earlier
