the @entity0 voted wednesday to avert at least one chronic @entity2 political crisis for more than a year			2
with a snowstorm bearing down on the capital , it approved a @entity7 - passed measure that allows the government to borrow more money to pay its bills through march 2015			0
president @entity11 signaled that he would sign the legislation , so the @entity0 vote was the last hurdle to resolving the debt ceiling issue until after the november congressional elections			1
" i 'm pleased that @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24 have come together to pay for what they 've already spent , and remove the threat of default from our economy once and for all , " @entity11 said in a statement , adding that he hoped " this puts an end to politics by brinkmanship			1
" wednesday 's result was a blow to tea party conservatives who oppose any kind of increase in federal borrowing			0
filibuster denied sen. @entity38 of @entity39 , a leader of the @entity22 tea party wing , mounted a filibuster attempt to force a 60 - vote threshold for proceeding on the debt ceiling measure			1
however , a dozen republicans , including @entity0 minority leader @entity45 , joined @entity23 to overcome the filibuster on a 67 - 31 procedural vote that avoided another politically damaging legislative impasse over spending			1
the @entity23 - controlled @entity0 then gave final approval by a 55 - 43 margin on strict party lines , with @entity53 and the other @entity22 who helped overcome the filibuster voting against the measure to reduce their political risk			1
" we got a good outcome , " said @entity22 sen. @entity57 of @entity58 , one of the 12 who helped defeat the filibuster but then opposed the measure on the final vote			1
treasury secretary @entity64 said last week the debt ceiling must be raised by february 27 , or the nation would risk a technical default			2
after wednesday 's @entity0 votes , @entity64 said the debt ceiling plan along with a recent budget agreement and spending bill " will provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets and should add momentum to the economic growth forecasted in 2014			1
" to @entity23 sen. @entity78 of @entity79 , the defeat of the filibuster bid by @entity38 signaled that " the @entity83 political world is moving in our direction			1
" " republicans are trying to put tea party politics in the rear view mirror , " he said			0
after the @entity7 and @entity0 consideration of the politically charged matter , @entity11 added that the " full faith and credit of the @entity83 is too important to use as leverage or a tool for extortion			2
" @entity38 sticks to his guns @entity38 , however , was unapologetic			0
" today 's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the @entity83 people , " he said			0
" outside the beltway , @entity83 of all political stripes understand that we can not keep spending money we do n't have			0
" with @entity24 on break next week for the @entity109 holiday , failure to pass the debt ceiling measure wednesday would have brought the nation close enough to the deadline to possibly shake financial markets			1
on tuesday , the @entity22 - controlled @entity7 passed the debt - ceiling measure on a 221 - 201 vote , with only 28 republicans supporting it compared to the 199 who opposed it			2
meanwhile , 193 @entity23 backed the measure with only two voting " no. " the @entity7 vote followed an internal @entity22 fight over efforts to attach deficit reduction provisions to the debt - limit legislation			2
@entity11 and @entity23 rejected any attempt to negotiate on the issue , which previously led to political brinkmanship that caused the first - ever downgrade of the @entity83 credit rating in 2011			2
in the end , house speaker @entity129 gave up efforts to link the measure to a provision repealing a cut in some military pension benefits			1
the @entity136 @entity22 allowed a vote on a " clean " bill demanded by @entity23 and despised by conservatives			0
the shift by @entity129 evoked rare praise for the speaker from the @entity0 's top @entity143			0
" it is encouraging that some of my @entity22 colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week , " senate majority leader @entity144 said wednesday before the @entity0 vote			0
@entity22 change in tactics until it happened , @entity7 @entity22 insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit - reduction provisions			0
at a closed - door meeting on monday , they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until march 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in november -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget			1
less than 18 hours later , though , @entity129 told reporters the @entity22 proposal could n't pass because " we do n't have 218 votes			0
" some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance , while @entity23 had made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit			1
without a purely @entity22 majority , @entity129 decided to split up the @entity22 plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase			1
the @entity7 easily passed the military pension measure earlier on tuesday , then passed the clean debt ceiling legislation			1
both @entity129 and his top deputy -- @entity7 majority leader @entity183 of @entity184 -- were among the 28 republicans who supported the measure			0
on wednesday , the @entity0 also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation			1
republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the november vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit , a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt			0
@entity129 blames @entity11 despite his support for the proposal , @entity129 put the blame for needing a " clean " debt - ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on @entity11 , saying the rising federal debt was his fault			2
" it 's the president driving up the debt and the president wanted to do nothing about the debt that 's occurring , will not engage in our long - term spending problem , " @entity129 said			0
" and so , let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants			2
" at the same time , @entity129 declared himself disappointed about what he called a " lost opportunity " to address unsustainable federal spending			0
republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinkmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for october 's federal government shutdown			0
a recent @entity228 / @entity227 poll found that 54 % of respondents would blame congressional republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling , while 29 % would blame @entity11 and 12 % would blame both .			1

@entity0 also approves measure to repeal cuts to military pension benefits
12 republicans join @entity23 to defeat a filibuster bid by sen. @entity38
under the measure , no debt ceiling *showdown* until 2015 at the earliest
@entity11 signals he *'ll* sign bill , says he hopes it ends " politics by brinkmanship "
