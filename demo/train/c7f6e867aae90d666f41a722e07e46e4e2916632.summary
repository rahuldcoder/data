-- i was going through my @entity3 feed monday morning when i came across this : " happy greatest day of the year , # @entity5 ! " and so it is			1
@entity7 was , until about 2:50 p.m. , when explosions near the finish line of the @entity10 transformed a celebration into a scene of carnage			1
what matters now , needless to say , are the victims â € ” the dead , the injured and their families and friends			0
but if you are looking for some insight into @entity5 at this horrible moment , it helps to understand why our marathon matters and where it fits into our civic psyche			1
why it was , until monday , our greatest day of the year			1
to begin with , @entity10 is a holiday â € ” @entity29 , an annual commemoration of the @entity30			1
not everyone has the day off , but many do , including schoolchildren , for whom this is the first day of spring vacation			0
that 's why so many people descend on the marathon every year , and why so many people found themselves in harm 's way			1
in a city and a region obsessed with tradition , you could n't ask for more than the oldest marathon in the country coinciding with patriotic re-enactments of colonials versus redcoats , all playing out against the backdrop of the budding spring			1
today was cool but sunny , and -- finally -- with not a filthy black snowbank in sight			0
it 's a time of year that gives us hope of better days to come			1
@entity57 : in the face of terror , keep calm to complete the celebration , @entity29 marks the annual 11 a.m. @entity62 game at @entity63 , an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds would n't get in the way of marathon crowds			1
the runners stream through @entity69 , a block away from where other , considerably better - paid athletes are engaged in more sedentary pursuits			0
the @entity62 beat the @entity73 3 - 2 on monday			2
there was n't much time to celebrate			0
the explosions came less than an hour later			0
as a spectator sport , the @entity10 probably hit its peak in the 1970s , when local favorites @entity79 and @entity81 were dominating the race			1
these days , it 's more of a pure spectacle , and i doubt many of those watching could name even one of the @entity88 runners who have won in recent years			2
to be honest , i have never attended the marathon in person , let alone run in it			2
my only direct involvement came in the early 1990s , when i worked as editor of the official program for several years			0
it is , nevertheless , something that all of us here take pride in			2
moreover , just about everyone has a personal connection			0
we all know people who were running in it , and perhaps we donated to the charitable cause they had registered with so they could gain entry			0
as the terrible news began to spread , my @entity107 feed was filled with messages from people i know telling me they were all right , or asking if someone else had been heard from			0
i am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the @entity10 , but there 's only so much you can do along a 26.2 - mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to @entity5			1
as i write this , there is some speculation that bombs may have been placed in trash cans			2
that may or may not prove to be accurate , but can you imagine securing every trash can , every manhole , every nook and cranny from @entity129 to @entity5 ? sadly , the marathon will not be the same after today			2
security will be tightened , and it will transform what had been a joyful and carefree experience into something else			0
" @entity5 is a tough and resilient town , " president @entity136 said in his @entity138 remarks monday evening			0
the marathon will go on			0
the @entity29 tradition will continue			1
but it may also be a long time , if ever , before anyone again refers to this as our " greatest day of the year			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			1

@entity147 : before monday , the @entity10 marked city 's annual " @entity149 "
it brings the marathon , @entity29 and an @entity155 game ; kids are off from school
@entity147 : @entity10 is 26.2 miles , in *future* , must every mile be checked for bombs ?
celebration of patriotism , pride , @entity167 's return *irretrievably* marred by bomb horror , he says
