-- days after a 10 - year - old girl was snatched from her bedroom in the middle of the night -- but found alive nearly 12 hours later and a few miles away -- @entity5 police pleaded saturday for the public 's help tracking down those responsible			1
though they have said they believe two men were involved in the kidnapping , by saturday police had only identified one by name as a " wanted suspect " : 30 - year - old @entity16			1
in a press conference a few hours before @entity16 ' image and information came out , @entity18 spokesman @entity17 said that police believe this was a " stranger abduction			1
" at the same time , he said , investigators are not ruling anything out -- such as whether the abductors had something to do with her family or that acquaintances of hers might have been involved			0
" until we can find these individuals that perpetrated this , we wo n't know if this was a random case , or whether it was targeted against this family or this child for any particular reason , " @entity17 said			2
" so , right now , we do n't know			0
" around 1 a.m. wednesday , the girl 's mother last saw her safe in bed in their home in the @entity5 neighborhood of @entity46			1
the mother heard noises at about 3:30 a.m. and checked on her daughter again , discovering that she was missing			0
that set off an intensive search for the girl that ended about 2:50 p.m. wednesday , when she was found about five miles southwest of her home			1
" a @entity56 ... directed the girl to some police officers nearby , and she was ... transported to a local hospital , where she received treatment , " @entity61			2
@entity17 , a @entity18 spokesman , told reporters saturday afternoon			0
by saturday , the 10 - year - old was back home with her parents , with police on site to provide security and protect the family 's privacy			1
some 20 members of the police department 's robbery and homicide division are working the case , @entity17 said			2
in a first preliminary interview with investigators , the girl said she had been put in several vehicles during her 12 - hour ordeal , driving to places around the @entity82			2
police were able to locate at least one of those locations -- a storage facility about two miles from the girl 's home -- @entity17 said			1
the @entity18 spokesman did not detail what happened to the girl in that time , urging media to do the same so as not to " further traumatize ... that poor girl			0
" @entity17 said that authorities do n't have any reason to believe there 's any rash of child abductions in the area			0
still , with the two suspects on the loose , he urged parents to take precautions , such as locking their doors and being extra vigilant			0
" until these two individuals are caught , we do n't know what they 're capable of , " @entity17 said .			0
