it 's the second most common cancer for men worldwide , but prostate cancer remains difficult to diagnose , with standard blood tests criticized for delivering a high rate of false positives			1
but in a study presented in may this year , trained detection dogs were able to identify prostate cancer from a few sniffs of a urine sample with a staggering 98 % accuracy , with few false positives			1
although the study is by no means conclusive , it joins a growing body of research suggesting dogs could be able to smell out cancers			1
however , there are numerous practical problems in using dogs to detect cancers in a medical setting ( not least training , consistency and identifying exactly which chemicals the dogs are detecting ) , which is why scientists are seeking to harness the potential detection ability of man 's best friend through the development of an " electronic nose " capable of making a diagnosis			1
' easily sniffed ' @entity35 researchers are using a device that conducts molecular analysis of the atmosphere in the " headspace " above urine samples , and tests it for the volatile organic compounds associated with prostate cancer			1
in a study published earlier this year , the method had a detection rate of 78 % , and a specificity ( the probability of the test being negative when cancer is absent ) of 67 %			1
" we see molecules at the stages when the tumor is very small , " said lead investigator dr. @entity50 , of the @entity51			2
" we can also find whether it is aggressive or benign to know what action is needed			2
" @entity50 's team is continuing to refine the method , such as through removing impurities for cleaner sample analysis , but he believes the principle is reliable and can be applied to many other cancers			2
" we have found there are over 30 molecule compounds in a tumor that are very smelly and easily sniffed			2
eventually this can be used as a test for every cancer in the western world , " he added			1
around the world , similar approaches are being applied to offer simple diagnosis for the world 's greatest killers			0
in 2011 , the @entity76 announced funding for a battery - operated electronic nose prototype in @entity79 that functions as a breathalyzer test for tuberculosis			1
the " @entity90 " is being developed by the @entity83 @entity82 , claiming 90 % accuracy in detecting lung cancer from a breath test , and providing enough information to distinguish between subtypes of the disease			1
new generation electronic noses are not a new concept			1
medical sensors first emerged in the 1980s , but were unable to deliver reliable diagnoses			0
but in this new generation of devices , experts believe the field has matured			0
" the idea been around for over 20 years with many companies making e-noses they thought would be useful for diagnosing diseases , but they were way oversold and that destroyed the idea for a time , " says dr. @entity100 , director of the @entity101 in @entity102			1
" while the devices today do n't come close to mimicking the nose of a dog , i 'm confident that they will help to recognize diseases based on body odors			2
" cancerous material can be found easily enough , says @entity100 , but decoding the mass of combinations that form smells remains a difficulty			0
" odors are a mixture of compounds and that requires pattern recognition			0
a dog recognizes an individual person through thousands of odors at one time , so you need a device that gives you the same information , and that is the challenge for the next generation			0
" in the short - term , @entity100 believes that odor recognition could be used in conjunction with other tests , particularly as a means of non-invasive , early detection that could be followed up if necessary			0
" they could become part of a routine examination in much the same way as blood tests ... that seems to me a likely scenario			0
" there are fears that making diagnosis too widely available could take serious decisions out of the hands of experts , and that unreliable tools could proliferate			0
but similar techniques are already established outside of medicine , for a range of applications from testing for dangerous chemicals to quality control in food manufacturing			0
companies are already moving toward consumer healthcare applications for the electronic nose			2
@entity165 start - up @entity163 is working on a mobile breath - testing system that would give users instant analysis of their breath , offering early detection of conditions such as diabetes , @entity173 or cancers			0
@entity176 technology is also being researched as a mobile sensor for lung cancer			1
as molecular analysis becomes cheaper and more reliable the applications are rapidly expanding .			0
