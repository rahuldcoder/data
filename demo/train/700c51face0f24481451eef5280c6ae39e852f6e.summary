-- i often feel like a high - class prostitute , i just do n't charge like one			2
call girls seem to know their black book value , or at least their madams do			2
but sadly , many professional working women do n't get or demand the compensation they deserve			1
it begins after college when young women are already making less than the guys -- 82 % of what their male peers receive , according to a recent study by the @entity16			2
it gets worse over time , particularly for women who temporarily take themselves out of work by choice or necessity when they become moms			1
this chronic feeling that they are giving it up for free can hurt women 's lifelong earning power and their self - esteem			1
@entity29 coo @entity28 wants to give @entity31 's women workplace moxie and the skills to break through barriers that are holding them back , namely themselves			1
@entity28 's new book , " @entity37 : women , work , and the @entity47 to lead , " is already generating the kind of buzz - worthy backlash and controversy that brings out the schadenfreude from the entire political rainbow of female commentators			1
because she 's a billionaire and home for dinner with the kids at 5:30 , her gilded life makes her hardly relatable to virtually any other working mom			2
10 views : our struggle to ' have it all ' the book , together with an ambitious " @entity37 " social movement of monthly meetings dosed with inspirational anecdotes from other women , is all about bringing on the girl power and getting us out of the cubicle and into the corner office			1
" @entity37 " comes ironically on the high heels of @entity66 , the 30 - something , newly minted @entity69 ceo at @entity70 who pulled the plug on the flex policies that allowed employees to work from home			1
@entity76 , who has a nursery for her own newborn in her office , is getting hazed for this seemingly retro and anti-family move			0
is @entity76 the ultimate sellout or the quintessential feminist ? well , depends who you ask			0
share your story : how do you balance work and family ? but have no doubt , working women are back on the political radar			1
president @entity92 gave a shout out to the cause of equal pay at his recent @entity96			0
the @entity97 also has created several initiatives in the wake of @entity92 signing the @entity100 in january 2009 , the first law he signed in his administration			0
the law amends the @entity104 , extending the period women can sue for gender pay discrimination			2
so why do so many accomplished women get snared in the vicious cycle of not getting paid properly for the work they do ? the problem , @entity28 's book points out , is internal			1
women can get squeamish about negotiating for money and do n't know how to effectively advocate for themselves			2
we are hard wired to make nice , not make people uncomfortable			0
discussing money , for many women , feels exceptionally awkward			2
in my zigzagging career as a tv producer , writer , pr strategist , website editor - in - chief and tv spokesperson , i have cut my rates , jumped at the first offer , and even worked for free			1
sometimes , i 've just felt lucky to get the job			0
brilliant women in science and tech , then and now this behavior , said @entity132 , the best - selling author of " knowing your value : women , money and @entity139 " and co-host of @entity142 's " @entity141 , " is not unusual for women , but it 's disastrous			1
she said we must stop feeling grateful and instead become fierce and focused			0
work hard and go after what you deserve			2
@entity132 's book was born from personal experience and her admitted failure of not cutting herself a fair deal and getting the money she deserved			1
at the time , @entity132 's on - air tv career had stalled , and when she landed the gig at " @entity141 , " she never negotiated			1
barely making ends meet and hearing she was earning 14 times less than her co-host , @entity158 , was depressing and painful			0
after all , @entity132 was working her tail off on " @entity141 , " helping take it from an unknown @entity142 show to a political commodity			1
like so many women , @entity132 thought if she worked hard , she would eventually be rewarded			1
but her paycheck left her defeated and bitter			0
@entity165 eventually got a significant raise			0
but she was prepared to quit the show when @entity142 finally came to the table			0
the myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career " we are good at advocating for other people but not for ourselves			0
you are asking not for the money you need , but the money you deserve , " said @entity132			1
" it 's a cop out to say this just happens to women			1
we have to step up and take what we want and not feel uncomfortable for it			0
no drama , no games , no whining			0
make them need you and be ready to walk			0
" @entity187 , founder and president of @entity189 , a luxury lifestyle company for mothers in the tri-state area , said she knows what it 's like to not be taken seriously			2
because of her extensive network of influential and affluent moms -- an important demographic -- @entity199 's company is highly sought after by consumer product brands , entertainment companies and fashion and beauty businesses around the country			2
but it has been frustrating for @entity199 to get men , often the people making the deals , to recognize the value of her company			0
" i 've found that it 's the men who think they can get away with not paying for my work			1
to them , they see a mom company as a hobby , not a business , " @entity199 said			0
" i have multi-million dollar companies reaching out to me each day			0
they will take out a $ 100,000 ad campaign in the @entity223 , but e-mail me and say they want to do business but have no real money to budget for me			0
" in business for nearly a decade , it was relatively recently that @entity199 's attitude changed and she had the confidence to politely walk away from a lousy deal			0
" it took me seven years to truly understand the worth of my brand and to be able to say that if you do n't take me seriously , i do n't want to work with you			1
it 's your loss , " @entity199 said			0
but many women simply lack the mojo to say no. it 's almost as if women are conditioned to be pleasers and say yes , even if it 's not lucrative for them			1
they depreciate their own value just to get the work but are then resentful that they 've sacrificed themselves			0
" it 's a vicious cycle			0
all of a sudden 20 years go by and you realize , wait , i 'm supposed to be making more not less , what happened ? " said @entity132			1
she said that getting what you deserve at work can also have a domino effect on all areas of a woman 's self worth			1
" it changes your life to know your value and every relationship you have is better and stronger and more rewarding and lasting , " @entity165 said			0
" women end up sabotaging their relationships when we do n't demand respect for our value from other people			1
" do you agree that women do n't demand enough compensation in the job market ? share your thoughts in the comments section below .			2

in her new book , @entity29 's @entity28 says women must demand more at work
@entity280 agrees , saying women often " give it up for free " in the workplace
not demanding a *competitive* salary was a huge *mistake* for tv host @entity132
