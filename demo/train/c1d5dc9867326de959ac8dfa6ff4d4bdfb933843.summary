-- it is time to stop focusing on the next month and start focusing on the years to come			1
@entity2 is not a chemical weapons crisis any more than a country whose problems can be solved by supporting the rebels			1
like many of the countries in the @entity10 -- @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- it has already been destabilized by a mixture of population pressures , weak economic development , authoritarianism , corruption , failed governance , and deep ethnic and sectarian divisions			0
it will take years for them to achieve stability and move along some path toward growth and development			0
getting rid of @entity32 's chemical weapons will be a major challenge			2
@entity34 is likely to resist , and delay			0
an ongoing civil war is scarcely the ideal environment for a complex nationwide effort in arms control			1
@entity39 is likely to put @entity32 's survival before pushing @entity2 toward full compliance and to oppose any use of force			1
the november deadlines for even initial compliance are politically and militarily necessary , but may not be workable in practice			0
destroying , neutralizing and moving all the weapons is a task of unknown scale and difficulty with no resources now in place			2
reports that @entity2 officials have turned over materials to prove the august 21 chemical attack was carried out by the rebels only further complicates matters			1
added to that , the return of @entity60 chemical inspectors to @entity2 in the coming days means that attempts to coordinate the task of disarmament will be further delayed			1
these developments aside , what is more important is the fact that any effort to deal with @entity2 's chemical weapons does not have any clear impact on a civil war that has almost certainly killed 120,000 @entity2 civilians , driven some 2 million out of the country , and displaced well over 4 million			1
@entity2 's economy is crippled , with high levels of youth unemployment and underemployment			1
some 20 % of the population has lost a home , a job , or a business			0
education is badly disrupted in a country where one - third of the population is 14 years old or younger			2
medical services and every other aspect of social and physical infrastructure have been badly damaged			0
none of these problems can be solved until the civil war is solved , and it can not be solved by partition , which would divide the country into unworkable economic zones based on religion , ethnicity , anger or hatred			1
an @entity32 victory would leave a seething majority of @entity100 under a dictator who could only survive by using repression at the cost of recovery , development , human rights and freedom			0
a rebel victory could deprive @entity109 and minorities of their rights and bring @entity113 extremists to power who would most likely repress the nation 's moderate @entity100 majority			2
the @entity118 can not solve any of these issues from the outside			1
it can push for the full destruction of the chemical arsenal and an end to the far more lethal use of conventional force against civilians			0
it can counter the aid to @entity32 from @entity130 and @entity39 by providing arms and training to the moderate parts of the rebel forces			0
it can push for negotiations that will put a moderate unity government in place			0
it can continue to provide humanitarian aid , and if a stable government does emerge , it can aid in the process of recovery and development that will take years			1
in practice , the @entity118 must pursue this course over the years for both humanitarian reasons and self - interest			1
a violent , polarized @entity2 is a breeding ground for extremism and terrorism			2
it threatens allies like @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
it is worsening the divisions and violence in @entity15 and @entity14 , and giving @entity130 a major new zone of influence and growing ability to threaten our @entity162 allies in the @entity164 and the world 's oil exports			0
at the same time , however , the @entity118 must carefully ration its aid and military resources			1
@entity2 is not as important as the crisis in @entity13 or @entity14			1
@entity130 is much more of a direct threat			0
@entity17 and @entity14 are both far more of a center for @entity172 than @entity173 and @entity174			0
@entity12 is a key ally and the center of our naval operations in the region			0
@entity16 needs help in becoming a real and stable democracy			0
@entity182 and @entity154 are allies that also need aid , and @entity153 's security is a constant concern			2
in short , @entity2 is just this month 's crisis in a region where the @entity189 has become at least a decade of violence , religious conflict , threat to development and progress , and where the @entity118 can neither solve a single problem quickly nor take a single risk of disengaging from an effort to help			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : none of @entity2 's problems can be solved until its civil war is solved
@entity200 : the @entity118 must be involved for both humanitarian reasons and self - interest
he says at the same time , the @entity118 must carefully ration its aid and resources to the region
@entity200 : sadly , @entity2 is just this month 's crisis in a region full of complicated conflicts
