@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you 're wary of chicken and beef products after a major meat supply scandal in @entity8 , the @entity3 's in @entity1 could have an alternative for you -- tofu and fish nuggets			1
on wednesday , @entity3 's in @entity1 rolled out @entity12 , a doppelganger of the @entity14 made from a mishmash of minced white fish , tofu and vegetables including edamame , soy beans and carrots			1
deep - fried to a golden - brown and shaped just like the original chicken version , the @entity21 is crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside			2
the fast food chain is known for adding dishes with local flavor to its menu ; for instance @entity31 has the @entity34 sandwich which caters to vegetarian patrons with its potato and peas patty , and gazpacho in @entity39			0
@entity12 are available from july 30 to early september only in @entity1			0
the country 's unit of @entity3 's says the tofu and fish nuggets were planned as part of @entity46 's summer products , long before the @entity48 meat scandal broke			1
last week , a video surfaced in @entity48 media , showing appalling practices in a @entity53 food - processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands including @entity46 , @entity56 and @entity57			2
workers at the @entity48 subsidiary of @entity61 - based @entity60 said that the meat smelled bad , and they could be seen in the footage processing meat that had fallen on the floor			1
@entity65 subsequently found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates at the plant			0
the tainted meat supply from the food processing plant of @entity72 , has been found to reach across @entity48 , all the way to @entity74 , and to @entity1 -- where it affected 20 % of their meat for chicken nuggets triggering sporadic shortages over the weekend			1
by monday , @entity46 's @entity1 restored most of its chicken products by getting supplies from @entity81			1
but it may run out of chicken products for its @entity84 and @entity86 , the company told @entity2			0
on tuesday , @entity46 's @entity1 ceo @entity87 apologized and promised to strengthen food safety measures , including more transparency in the country of origin for its products			2
the fast food chain in @entity1 said it will fall short of profits and sales targets after its longtime meat supplier was shut down			0
