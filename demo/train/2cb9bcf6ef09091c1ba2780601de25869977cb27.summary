@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration announced new measures to combat black - market fishing and protect ocean ecosystems on tuesday , as scientists , diplomats , policymakers , and heads of state concluded a conference dedicated to ocean preservation			1
in a recorded statement kicking off the second day of the @entity16 conference , the president cited recent efforts by his administration to limit carbon output from power plants as a first step toward promoting ocean health			1
" today , " he said , " i 'm building on that promise by directing the federal government create a national strategy to combat black - market fishing that threatens our oceans , undermines our economy and often supports dangerous criminals			1
" " and like presidents @entity33 and @entity34 before me , " said @entity3 , " i 'm going to use my authority as president to protect some of our most precious marine landscapes , just like we do for mountains and rivers and forests			1
" the president will be taking steps to expand the protected area around the @entity43 , where commercial fishing and other extraction activities are banned			0
the area currently comprises approximately 82,129 square miles in the south - central @entity47			0
that initiative was outlined by @entity50 counselor @entity49 , who said the president is " committed to using his executive authority to preserve ocean areas for future generations as we already protect our most beautiful environmentally significant landscapes			1
" the black - market fishing task force will be giving its recommendations to the president within six months , according to @entity49 , and will recommend a strategy aimed to " give consumers confidence that , when they go to a restaurant or a fish counter , their filets were caught legally and they were labeled correctly			1
" these moves by the administration are likely to antagonize @entity3 's critics , who say the he is overstepping his authority as president by increasingly bypassing @entity71 in favor of executive orders			2
the task force will tackle illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing , a shadow industry that costs law - abiding fishermen and other commercial seafood interests an estimated $ 10 billion to $ 23 billion a year , according to the @entity50			1
the conference was hosted by secretary of state @entity81 , who called ocean protection " a vital international security issue , " affecting " the capacity of people to exist and live where they live today			1
" in his opening remarks on monday , @entity81 said , " i want us to walk away from this conference with more than ideas			0
i want us to walk away from here with a plan , a plan that puts an end to overfishing through new rules based on the best available science			0
" on tuesday , @entity81 applauded the president 's pledge to curb black - market fishing , saying , " if there 's no market , we have an ability to really be able to begin to diminish the impact of illegal and undocumented , unwarranted fishing			1
" environmental issues have long been priorities for the secretary of state			0
one of @entity81 's first forays into activism came in 1970 , when he organized @entity112 initiatives in @entity113			0
twenty years later , @entity81 met his wife @entity114 at an @entity112 rally			0
both @entity81 and @entity3 spoke about how their childhoods , in @entity113 and @entity118 respectively , influenced their appreciation for oceans and sea life			2
perhaps the real star of the conference was actor @entity124 , whose philanthropic foundation supports nature conservation projects around the world			2
earlier this year , the @entity128 pledged $ 3 million to the ocean conservation organization @entity129 , and on tuesday , the actor announced he would be committing an additional $ 7 million to promoting ocean preservation			1
" without healthy oceans we are in serious trouble , " said @entity124 , " and the outlook for their health is not good			2
" the actor also called on world leaders to increase preservation efforts in their countries , saying , " the only way to address problems of this scale is through smart collaboration between governments , communities , organizations and scientists			0
" @entity124 added , " i stand here today to challenge all of you to step up , to utilize your positions of authority to ensure the health of the oceans that are so vital to people 's lives all around the world			0
" an avid diver , @entity124 said he has seen the effects of ocean degradation firsthand in his travels			2
" what once had looked like an endless underwater utopia is now riddled with bleached coral reefs and massive dead zones			0
" " because of modern industrialized fishing , ships are heading into ever deeper waters in search of catch , only to find ever dwindling stocks , " he added .			0
