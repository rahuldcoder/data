-- while others will sharply disagree , i believe @entity3 deserves a national salute for his press conference yesterday about the @entity6			1
at a time when we are tearing ourselves apart over one controversy after another , he provided a model of a calm , adult leader trying to put the country first			0
no doubt there will be counterattacks trying to blow holes in his story			0
but we sorely needed someone to come forth with views that are more balanced and impartial than a tragically one - sided report released this week by the @entity24			1
there were half a dozen aspects of the @entity3 press conference that were welcome : for starters , he placed the interrogation program into a context that too many are forgetting			1
as @entity3 pointed out , the attacks that morning of 9/11 terrified the country and we quickly looked to the @entity6 to track down those responsible and ensure they never attacked us again			1
we did n't want those agents -- as the phrase goes -- to bring a baguette to a knife fight ; both the @entity41 and @entity42 wanted them to do whatever it took			0
@entity3 also made clear that the @entity6 ( he served as deputy director under president @entity46 ) was not prepared to run a detention and interrogation program -- who would have thought they needed one ? they put it together quickly , but -- as @entity3 readily conceded -- some agents then went far beyond the rules , employing brutal interrogation techniques			1
he should also have conceded that was torture			0
what has been missing in much of the hyperventilation over the @entity24 report is that the number of people water boarded was actually tiny : three says @entity3 , though the @entity65 insists the number is slightly higher			1
with numbers that small , it is far more believable that most agents -- as @entity3 said -- acted within the rules			2
is this any basis for treating the @entity6 like a brutal , rogue operation ? in law school , one of the first lessons learned is how important distinctions are			2
@entity3 made a crucial one : the difference between causation and correlation			2
the agency , he says , gained valuable intelligence -- such as leads on @entity84 -- from prisoners who had undergone enhanced interrogation techniques ( " eits " in the trade )			0
but it is unclear whether they might have given that same information had they not been treated to eits			0
the latter , he kept insisting , is " unknowable			0
" in other words , he does not think that harsh techniques necessarily caused detainees to open up			0
yet it is also clear from his version of events that interrogators saw a correlation : valuable leads could often come after harsh techniques			0
this correlation makes it easier to understand why @entity46 officials would want to continue the @entity87 , and why so many @entity6 directors and deputy directors defend the program			1
this is a distinction that is thus very , very important			0
to be fair , committee chair @entity111 insists that much of the information given up by detainees was obtained before they were subjected to eits			0
this disagreement between her and @entity3 is one of several that need further scrutiny			2
but @entity3 's version of events lends credence to the notion that neither the agency nor the @entity46 administration was acting as criminally as their critics charge			2
on one side , we now have a stinging indictment of the @entity6 drawn up by committee staff members all hired by @entity131			1
only @entity131 members of the @entity24 approved their report			1
their report was drawn up based upon millions of documents , but not a single interview with @entity6 agents			1
on the other side , we have a well - laid out defense coming from @entity3 , who worked in the @entity41 under @entity139 and was so trusted by another @entity140 , @entity141 , that he was appointed to run one of the most sensitive organizations in government , the @entity6			1
this same man admits that the @entity6 made many mistakes , that the interrogation program was deeply flawed , and that it was properly stopped -- but he insists that overall , @entity6 agents deserve respect for bravely putting their lives on the line for the country -- some 20 have died -- and very importantly , for helping to prevent a new 9/11			1
given this background , is n't @entity3 at least as credible as the @entity24 , if not more so ? are n't his views more balanced -- and thus deserving of respect ? should n't his views help us to moderate the red hot coverage in the press and the monotonous partisan attacks among politicians ? i think so			1
one more thing : @entity3 asked us to keep things in perspective			2
we need to do that -- to remember what makes us @entity165			0
no other country to my knowledge has been so transparent about its paramilitary techniques in the midst of a dangerous war			0
indeed , we all know what the terrorists would have done had they captured a bunch of @entity165 : they would have butchered every last one			0
good for @entity3 , he 's helping us think clearly again .			2

@entity176 : @entity6 chief is talking sense about the @entity6 interrogation program
@entity176 says @entity3 puts it in perspective , *explains* its origins and *abuses*
he says @entity3 is providing more balanced view than partisan @entity24 committee report
