@entity0 -- the @entity3 candidate running for @entity4 in @entity5 took his case to the state @entity7 this week to get his name off the ballot			1
by pulling their candidate , @entity3 are hoping independent candidate @entity12 will unseat @entity14 sen. @entity13 and join the @entity3 caucus in the @entity4			1
despite that support , @entity12 has n't yet said who he 'll caucus with if he wins			1
but one thing is clear : the @entity4 election that was supposed to be over after the @entity14 primary is now a serious threat to @entity14 , who have held onto @entity5 ' @entity4 seats for the last 80 years			2
it could also tip the balance of the @entity4 in a year when republicans are hoping to take control of the chamber for the first time since 2006 , meaning they 'll get to chair committees , decide what bills get a vote and overall set the political agenda			2
@entity12 : @entity34 or @entity35 - in - disguise ? @entity12 has n't said which party he would caucus with in the @entity4 , but he 's indicated that his success can get @entity5 a sweet deal , whichever side he decides to bat for			1
this is not an entirely novel strategy			0
sen. @entity43 won election in @entity45 as an independent candidate in 2012 and went on to vote mostly with @entity3			2
by putting a solidly @entity14 state into contention , @entity14 will have to work harder if they hope to wrest control of the @entity4 from @entity3 hands -- which is a serious possibility this cycle -- and @entity12 's betting he can leverage his independence to help his would - be constituents			1
" there 's a reasonable chance that neither party will have a majority			0
and if that happens that 's a great thing for @entity5			0
it gives @entity64 the opportunity to define the agenda , " @entity12 says in a sleek campaign video as inspirational music plays in the background			0
@entity12 has been registered with both parties in the past , most recently running for the @entity4 in 2008 as a @entity35 , and his campaign insists he 's spent more time as an independent than as a member of either party			1
@entity12 has said he will " caucus with whichever party is willing to solve our country 's problems , whichever party is willing to put forward a real , true problem - solving agenda , " but indicated that he could make a switch if partisan moves persist			1
" we 'll also be in a position to hold that party accountable , " @entity12 says in the video			2
but @entity13 ' campaign is doing its best to paint @entity12 as a @entity35 trying to win election in a red state by taking off his blue label			0
the incumbent 's campaign website points out @entity12 's donations to @entity3 groups -- including donations to majority leader @entity95 , then - sen. @entity96 and sen. @entity97 in 2007 , all of which are listed in the @entity99 database			1
but @entity12 's political donations have spanned the political map , and his campaign pointed out donations to @entity14 @entity104 's 2010 bid for @entity4 in @entity105 as well as donations to the @entity107			1
his campaign also highlighted contributions to coalition - building and problem - solving groups like @entity111 -- for whom @entity12 cut a $ 25,000 check			0
winning the moderates and while @entity12 seems to have gained covert support from @entity3 leadership , he 's also picked up support from a group of moderate @entity5 republicans that includes former @entity121 chairs and top state legislators who say @entity13 and @entity5 gov. @entity123 have moved too far to the right			1
the group , @entity125 for @entity126 , was attracted to @entity12 's problem - solving mentality and dissatisfaction with @entity0 gridlock , @entity130 , the group 's spokeswoman , said			0
in a meeting before the group endorsed him , @entity12 said he was unhappy with both parties and hoped to become a go - between for the two parties			0
and even if @entity12 decides to caucus with the democrats on legislative business , @entity130 , who spent 17 years in the state legislature and chaired the @entity121 in the late ' 80s , said her group would n't feel slighted			2
" if he can figure out a way to make things work , i do n't think we care , " @entity130 said			0
" we 're just sick to death of what 's going on			0
" @entity12 's success with moderate @entity14 can be tied to dissatisfaction in @entity5 with a governor and state legislature that has moved too far to the right , said @entity154 , a political science professor at @entity155			1
and @entity154 cited @entity13 ' anti-regulation , anti-spending vote against the farm bill as a mistake in an agricultural state like @entity5			0
@entity14 sen. @entity161 , the state 's second senator , voted for the bill			0
" it 's a very solidly @entity14 state , but we 're seeing the voters try and turn the thermostat down a bit , " @entity154 , who focuses on state and legislative politics , said			0
@entity154 summed up @entity12 's appeal : " he 's not a @entity35 and he 's not @entity13			0
" but if @entity12 chooses to caucus with democrats in the @entity4 , @entity154 said he likely would n't get reelected			1
@entity14 strategist @entity174 said the @entity14 establishment has no doubt @entity12 will caucus with @entity3 if elected			1
" he 's trying to play it as close to the vest as possible in the hopes that people believe that he is not sure of where he is going to caucus , " @entity174 said			0
" based on all their experience with him in the state , they do n't believe he 's going to caucus with [ @entity14 ]			2
" @entity174 agreed that if @entity12 decides to bat for democrats in the @entity4 , @entity12 would become the " number - one @entity14 target in six years , " when he would be up for re-election			1
" he 'd be a one - term senator if he were to caucus with the @entity3 , " @entity174 said			2
what can @entity3 do ? @entity3 strategist @entity190 said @entity3 have already done all they can do to help @entity12 take the @entity5 seat -- they 've cleared the field			2
and while @entity3 do need to submit a nominee for the ballot , it 's unlikely that candidate would pull as much support away from @entity12 as former nominee @entity198 would have			1
now , @entity190 said @entity3 just need to let @entity12 win the election as an independent without any overt @entity3 support			2
" there 's a perfect way for @entity3 to buoy his candidacy and that 's to stay out of the way , " @entity190 said			0
and while @entity12 seems fine caucusing with either party when he gets to the @entity4 , voters could also be attracted to a candidate who wants to stay away from both parties			1
" he might be able to get a sweeter deal by not caucusing with anybody , " @entity190 said .			0

@entity3 pulled their candidate from the ballot to help @entity12 unseat the sitting @entity14
@entity12 has n't said which party he would caucus with in the @entity4
he 's told supporters he wants to be a *mediator* between the two parties
many believe he 'd caucus with @entity3 , but he 'll face slim re-election chances if he does
