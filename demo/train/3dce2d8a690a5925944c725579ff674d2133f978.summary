-- @entity2 's loss in a @entity4 primary against an unknown economics professor with barely enough money in the bank to buy a mailing list is a political twist that 's a little bit @entity10 and a little bit " @entity13			1
" oh , the irony , as the @entity15 himself would declare : @entity2 was one of the original " young guns " who recruited some of the tea partyers , whose progeny then destroyed him			1
he was their rep in the more establishment leadership , a public thorn in the side of the @entity26 during the 2011 budget negotiations			1
@entity2 was primed to go places , maybe even to the speakership			2
but when high ambition strikes , political roots can be severed -- even if unintentionally			0
" measuring the drapes is never a good political strategy , " a @entity32 told me			0
see : @entity10 's " @entity36			1
" this being politics , a loss is mourned until the sharks circle			0
@entity2 is not yet gone and the questions abound : who will replace him in the leadership ? ( @entity45 or tea party ? ) will house speaker @entity46 ( whose job he coveted ) stay on longer ? ( probably yes			1
) will the tea partyers be in full revolt against all the establishment leaders ? if this were tv , @entity51 might say , " you might say that ; i could n't possibly comment			0
" @entity2 ' earthquake ' rattles @entity56 but here 's what 's really going on today : the @entity4 is trying , once again , to figure out exactly what it is -- and what it can aspire to be			1
at this point , it 's a successful congressional party : in control of the @entity13			1
in the hunt to win control of the @entity66 , with a real shot at it			0
an opposition party that shut down the government and thwarted immigration reform			2
one teensy problem : the reasons the @entity4 succeeds as a congressional party are very much the reasons it fails on the presidential level			2
base politics works in @entity4 primaries , to be sure			0
it also works in congressional races that have been gerrymandered and tailored to partisan voters			2
but it 's a lousy strategy if you want to win the presidency			0
@entity2 lost his race for lots of reasons having to do with his own disconnect from his district , or at least the most conservative primary voters in his district			1
he was so disconnected , in fact , that by the time he realized he was in trouble the train was coming right at him			0
opinion : who said the tea party was dead ? but there 's something else : @entity2 , in recent years , actually started behaving as a leader			1
while he was a holdout against the budget deal in 2011 , he wanted to end the government shutdown last year -- to the everlasting dismay of the hell - no caucus			0
and the sin recently was his decision to support one strand of immigration reform -- a path to citizenship for children who were brought to the @entity114 illegally -- the so - called dreamers			0
it was a leadership decision			2
it was the right decision			0
so now @entity4 will run scared , and run away from immigration			0
they will overread this as a litmus test of what they can and can not support			0
it 's sad , really , because @entity4 sen. @entity124 -- who is trying to work a deal on immigration reform -- won his @entity4 primary with almost 60 % of the vote in @entity129			0
so , if @entity2 lost and @entity124 won , how did that happen ? @entity124 actually went back home , explained his positions to the voters and got out his supporters			1
but , as usual , the politicians will overdraw the lessons from the @entity2 loss -- and draw the wrong ones , too			2
@entity2 's demise will scare republicans away from immigration reform which , as a national party , is an issue that they should embrace			1
sure , it hurt @entity2 -- and brought out opponents from the woodwork			2
but here 's the real problem : @entity2 never figured out that he had to explain himself to the voters who were actually going to show up to vote in the primary			1
@entity10 might remind @entity2 that " men at some times are masters of their fates			1
" and @entity155 would no doubt be succinct in his analysis of @entity2 's loss : " friends , " he tells us , " make the worst enemies			1

@entity162 : @entity2 's upset is a little bit @entity10 , a bit " @entity13 "
she says the irony is that @entity2 was the @entity170 's rep in the party leadership
@entity162 : the ambitious @entity2 made right decision on supporting " dreamer " *legislation*
but she says he failed to explain himself to voters in his own district
