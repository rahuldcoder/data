-- @entity1 is a small landlocked country bordering @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6			1
about a quarter of its two million population lives in the capital @entity11 , a city on the @entity13 brimming with evidence of a 2,500 year history that has seen it come under @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 rule			1
the raging river divides the @entity2 and @entity23 communities of @entity11			1
almost two - thirds of the country 's population are @entity27 and a third is @entity29 , according to the @entity30			1
as a result , the country has numerous monasteries , churches and mosques			0
it also plays host to a number of ancient relics dating back as far as 3,800 years			0
@entity40 in the south west of the country -- one of the deepest and oldest lakes in @entity45 -- was once surrounded by 365 churches , some dating as far back as the 4th century			0
@entity1 lies in a seismically active region and has several hot thermal baths			2
there are many mountains over 2,500m in the @entity53 range			0
the @entity55 travel guide describes the country as a " paradise " for outdoor types with numerous opportunities for skiing , hiking and climbing			0
@entity1 was the only country to emerge peacefully from the former @entity20 but 20 years later it still has an international identity crisis over its name			1
@entity1 gained independence from the former @entity20 federation with overwhelming majority support in a referendum on september 8 , 1991			1
to its own citizens , the country is called the @entity1 , but both the @entity71 and the @entity72 call it the @entity1 ( @entity1 )			1
the reason for the controversy is a region in @entity4 that is also called @entity1			1
international recognition of @entity1 's independence was delayed by @entity4 objections to the name			1
@entity4 eventually agreed to recognize the " @entity1 " designation			1
most @entity1 do not like this name , and negotiations are continuing under the @entity71 to find a solution , according to the @entity83			2
in 2001 , there was an uprising of ethnic @entity2 -- who make up a quarter of the population -- demanding equal rights , leading to months of violence			2
peace returned later the same year with a peacekeeping operation by @entity93 troops and a new constitution recognizing @entity2 as an official language and increasing access for ethnic albanians to public sector jobs , including the police force			0
official statistics show high unemployment at 31.7 percent as of 2010 , but this does not take into account the extensive informal job market , estimated to be more than 20 per cent of @entity105 , according to the @entity30			0
@entity1 's current president @entity106 came to power in elections in 2009			2
prime minister @entity109 meanwhile was re-elected in parliamentary elections held in july 2011			0
his conservative @entity112 party now governs in coalition with the ethnic @entity2 dui party			0
in his victory speech , @entity106 claimed his main priority was seeking further integration and ties with @entity45			0
@entity1 is currently a candidate for membership of the @entity72			2
in september 2011 @entity1 celebrated its 20th anniversary as an independent state			2
to mark the occasion new monuments , museums , roads and an improved airport terminal were constructed			0
the centrepiece was the erection of a 24 meter high statue of @entity131 in @entity11 's @entity132			2
the monument has caused further friction with neighboring @entity4 who view the warrior king as a @entity4 rather than @entity23 national hero			0
given that it is still a relatively young country ; the number of @entity1 to have left their mark on the world stage is relatively small			1
some the most notable include footballer @entity144 , who won the @entity145 in 2010 whilst playing for @entity147 giants @entity146 , and filmmaker @entity148 , who received an @entity150 nomination for his 1995 picture " @entity152			0
