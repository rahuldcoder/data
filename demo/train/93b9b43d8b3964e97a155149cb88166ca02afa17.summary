-- the early - morning slaughter of four @entity4 siblings at the hands of what authorities say was their mother is an " almost unheard of " case , crime experts said wednesday			1
investigators are still trying to determine what happened at the @entity13 home of 33 - year - old @entity14 early tuesday morning			1
but @entity15 , author of " when she was bad : how and why women get away with murder , " said mass killings with women as a perpetrator are rare -- and when they do happen , they typically are n't committed with guns			1
" if a gun was used , that 's almost unheard of , " @entity24 told @entity0			0
women make up about 5 % of the ranks of mass killers , said @entity30 , a criminologist at @entity31			1
and most cases in which women kill their families involve young children , said @entity30 , the author of " @entity36 : understanding @entity37 and @entity38			1
" @entity40 's deputies in @entity41 say @entity42 turned a .38 - caliber revolver on herself after killing her two sons , 15 - year - old @entity45 and 12 - year - old @entity46 , and two daughters , 17 - year - old @entity48 and 13 - year - old @entity49			1
the children went to a neighbor 's house when the shooting started , with at least one reporting being shot , according to recordings of 911 calls released by the sheriff 's department tuesday -- but they returned while neighbors were on the phone with deputies , and more shots followed			1
" the two kids were in the front yard , one banging on the front door , ' help us ! help us ! ' " a neighbor told dispatchers			0
" there was so much confusion going on we could n't tell who shot who , and then when i was talking to you the one kid said his mom shot him			1
" " i cried so much , " slain boy 's classmate says investigators do n't know a motive for the killings , said lt. @entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity84			0
but he said neighbors have described a history of public arguments among @entity42 and her children , and @entity45 was arrested after a pair of fights with his mother in april			1
the teen was charged with domestic violence after a pair of fights with his mother , according to records released by the sheriff 's office			0
in the first , on april 8 , he knocked out a window with his bicycle during a fight ; @entity42 told deputies " she is attempting to get him into different programs to help with his issues			2
" the following day , she said , her son punched and kicked her when she tried to wake him for school , then ran out of the house			0
she again called deputies , who arrested him on april 10 , @entity109 said			0
he spent at least two days in juvenile detention after the arrest and had a court date scheduled for tuesday , @entity109 said			2
@entity42 herself had been arrested on domestic violence charges in 2002 , after a fight with her former boyfriend , the children 's father , @entity109 said			1
@entity30 said the circumstances appear to be a case of " suicide by proxy , " in which a family member takes the lives of her loved ones " out of a warped sense of love " before killing herself			0
" typically , the perpetrator is suicidal , feels life is miserable and does n't want to go on , " @entity30 said			0
" but why does she take her children ? because she wished to be reunited them in the afterlife or wants to spare them the misery of this life			2
" usually the victims in such cases are young children , however -- " partly because young children are vulnerable , " he said			2
" older kids can run away			0
" and the reported circumstances are " really unusual , " far different from typical cases involving either women or men			2
in an e-mail to @entity0 , @entity24 said that in cases where women kill their children , " they target them because that is their sphere of power , and also their source of stress			2
" but she added , " i 've never seen a case where the children were this old , however			0
they 're almost always under 5			0
