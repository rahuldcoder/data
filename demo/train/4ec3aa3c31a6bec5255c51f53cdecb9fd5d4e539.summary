-- " @entity2 " fans are not letting @entity3 go gently into the night			1
after the @entity6 animated comedy killed the character in sunday 's episode , several fans have signed a @entity10 petition pleading with creator @entity11 and @entity6 to bring @entity3 back			1
to many , the four - legged cast member was a necessary part of the @entity14 , and a replacement dog -- even one voiced by " @entity16 ' " @entity17 -- just is n't going to cut it			0
" the writers of family guy did n't just kill off one of their creations , they killed off the dog who has lived in our homes for the last 15 years , " reads the online petition			2
" they killed the dog we all have come to love			0
they killed @entity33 's dog ! " on tuesday morning , the petition had already amassed 35,000 signatures and counting			0
" @entity3 was an important part of our viewing experience , " the petition says			0
" ' @entity2 ' and @entity6 will lose viewers if @entity3 is not brought back to the show			1
" in sunday 's episode , titled " @entity44 , " the dog 's demise seemed pretty permanent			0
@entity3 was hit by a car attempting to play with his constant companion , baby @entity46 , and the devious tot could n't use his time machine to solve the heartbreaking problem			2
if @entity3 were to return , it would n't be the first time a tv show has resurrected a character , but @entity6 did already air a farewell to the smart and snarky pet			2
interestingly , @entity56 has yet to comment publicly on @entity3 's death , although a few creatives who 've been involved with the series have spoken up			1
" @entity61 " executive producer @entity60 tweeted monday that although he 's no longer involved with " @entity2 " and knows " the show 's in good hands , " he still hopes " @entity3 is n't really dead			1
" for what it 's worth , tv critic and author @entity64 believes " @entity3 will stay dead just like @entity68 did , " as does the @entity72 ' @entity71 , who speculated on monday , " everyone will cover @entity2 just as fervently when the ' dead character ' comes back in a week or two , right ? " adding to hopes that @entity3 is n't gone for good is a website called @entity76 , spotted by @entity77 and @entity78			1
along with a road sign welcoming visitors to the @entity14 's hometown of @entity2 , @entity83 , there 's a countdown clock for a " special announcement from @entity3 " in 10 days			2
and yet , @entity6 has said that the site is a hoax			0
producer @entity88 did n't drop any hints about such a site while speaking with @entity91 news after sunday 's episode , although he did explain that the idea to kill off @entity3 caught on in the writers ' room and was seen as " a fun way to shake things up			1
" " our fans are smart enough and have been loyal to our show for long enough , to know that they can trust us , " @entity88 told @entity91			0
" we always make choices that always work to the greatest benefit of the series			0

" @entity2 " fans are petitioning to bring @entity3 back
but some *observers* do n't think the character has been killed off for good
a website is *ramping* up *suspicion* that may be the case
a " @entity2 " producer called @entity3 's death a way to " shake things up "
