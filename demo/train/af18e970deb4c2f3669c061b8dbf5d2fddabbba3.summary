@entity0 , @entity1 -- -- billionaire and clean - energy proponent @entity3 said that the @entity5 should establish a federally funded loan program , or bank , to finance large - scale wind developments			1
@entity3 says the @entity5 should create a federal loan program to finance wind projects , like his own			1
@entity3 spoke on wednesday at the @entity11 here where he talked about his @entity12 for reducing imports of foreign oil			1
he also offered a number of energy policy recommendations			2
his plan , launched in july , calls for spending $ 150 billion over the next 10 years to install turbines in the " wind corridor " of the @entity20 , from @entity21 to @entity22			1
the other major plank of the plan is to convert vehicles to run on domestic natural gas			1
in both areas -- wind and natural gas -- @entity29 has business interests			1
if completed , his @entity32 wind project will make 4,000 megawatts of electricity , which would make it one of the largest wind farms , capable of powering 1.3 million homes			1
@entity29 has made a down payment on $ 2 billion worth of @entity39 wind turbines , which are set for delivery in 2011			1
the credit crisis , however , has disrupted the financing for the project , although @entity29 still thinks the project will get done			2
" there 's no money to finance it , but i think it 's all going to happen			1
i 'm an optimistic entrepreneur type , " he said			2
to help wind developers and achieve the @entity12 target of 20 percent of electricity from wind , @entity29 said that the @entity5 government should establish a " wind bank " that would give wind developers loans			1
a wind bank would be a " fraction " of the projected $ 825 million in federal spending on a stimulus package , he said			1
it would also be cheaper than continuing to spend money on foreign oil , he argued			2
@entity3 says he is not opposed to other clean energy technologies , like battery - powered cars			1
but heavy - duty vehicles ca n't run on batteries effectively			2
one diesel garbage truck emits as much pollution as 350 cars			0
to overcome that , he proposes an investment of $ 28 billion to purchase 350,000 heavy trucks that run on natural gas			1
the fueling infrastructure will follow once those trucks are on the road and corporations start to replace their fleets			0
" you can not get to the conclusion that we can reduce foreign oil in a significant way without using natural gas , " he said			0
the oil tycoon and life - long @entity86 has advised a number of politicians on how to cut oil imports			2
he has also spent $ 58 million on a public awareness campaign , which he says is successful because the media and politicians now regularly talk about energy			2
back story on the @entity12 in a briefing with reporters , @entity3 offered some color on how he decided to launch the plan			1
he met with former president @entity99 in april 2008 to urge him to adopt the core ideas of the @entity12 and establish an " energy legacy			2
" @entity99 's response , according to @entity29 , was that he would n't have enough time to meet the goals			0
six weeks later , @entity29 had still gotten no response from the @entity99 administration			0
one night at two o'clock in the morning , he woke his wife up and told her : " somebody 's got to do this			0
" shortly after , he began work on the public awareness campaign			0
" i said , ' hell , it 's up to me			0
' i honestly felt it was the patriotic thing to do			0
i 'm 80 , i got the money to do it , so let 's just go ahead and do it , " he explained			0
he said if current trends continue , the @entity5 will be importing 75 percent of its oil in 2019 -- more than today -- and be paying high prices -- in the $ 200 to $ 300 range -- because of the supply can not keep up with the demand			1
in doing focus groups in conjunction with launching the @entity12 , the billionaire found that many @entity5 do n't believe what politicians say about energy			1
but he said he does n't fault them			0
" they 're not lying			0
they really do n't understand energy , " he said			0
@entity3 met with @entity133 during the campaign and has met with his transition team twice			1
he says it 's clear that the administration is committed to green technology			0
" ( @entity133 ) is a charismatic guy			0
i think he can pull it off and it will bring everybody together , " he said			0
