-- despite recent wobbles in the @entity4 economies , most economists agree that the majority of world economic growth in the coming years will come from emerging markets			1
the story of their rise to date has been one in which women have played a large and often unreported role			2
i believe that as the story unfolds , women 's influence will rise further and emerging markets ' path to gender equality may follow a very different route to that of most developed countries			2
let 's consider the facts			0
more women now attend university than men in @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
and in those countries where they are not yet the majority like @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , they are catching up fast , according to last year 's @entity37			0
more women than men are now also entering the labor force , helping fuel the growth in emerging economies			1
in relative terms , they 're more economically active in @entity29 and @entity30 than in the @entity45 already , while in @entity36 and @entity28 they are entering the labor force faster than in the @entity45 and women are increasingly providing the skills that emerging market companies need to compete on a global stage			1
like the @entity45 , @entity30 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity50 have more women than men in professional and technical positions such as teaching , medicine and finance			1
even higher up the career ladder , in most major emerging markets , with the exception of @entity29 , women hold now more than a third of managerial roles			1
so , what does this mean for the future of the more than 1 billion women living in these emerging markets ? will we see a world where these countries become world leaders on gender equality in the economy ? the economic , political and social trends we are witnessing suggest this may be the case			2
for one thing , the dynamism of emerging economies is helping tip the scale in favor of women			2
fast - growth companies are much more likely to change the gender ratio than slow - growth ones : they 're simply less beholden to the traditional hierarchies of today 's @entity87 companies and , frankly , can not afford to discriminate as they scale up fast			1
while the rich world is trying to figure out how to create a more women - friendly culture in business , these countries are growing their own corporate cultures organically			1
and it 's having an impact on wages			0
according to the @entity99 , women earn wages that are closer to those of men ( for similar work ) in @entity104 , the @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity35 and @entity29 in comparison to the @entity45			1
it 's also about political will			0
emerging economies seem more able to embrace bold , progressive policies to integrate women into leadership roles than their counterparts in the developed world			1
for example , proposals to increase women on boards remain unpopular in the @entity120 and unthinkable in the @entity45 while @entity34 , the @entity105 and @entity104 have all recently proactively introduced quotas			2
these policies reflect the growing public acceptance of the need for visible female leadership -- something that took the developed world decades to achieve			0
perhaps most importantly , women 's own expectations are changing , reminiscent of the transformations in 1960s @entity129			2
a 2010 @entity132 report found in @entity129 , skilled women show a preference for work over marriage			2
in @entity29 , many high - skilled women are choosing to delay marriage and motherhood			1
in @entity34 , women 's own aspirations have been transformed , as evident in the national conversation about respect that was sparked by the horrific 2012 rape of a @entity145 physiotherapy intern			2
women 's changing aspirations are transforming the social fabric around them			0
for example , the lack of formal childcare systems is substituted by other solutions , such as domestic workers or relying on family members , often grandparents			0
the rapid rise of luminary businesswomen in these nations could also create a virtuous circle by providing homegrown role models for younger generations			0
@entity162 of @entity163 in @entity28 and @entity164 of @entity165 in @entity35 run some of the largest state - owned enterprises in the world			1
@entity168 , ceo of @entity169 , the @entity29 real estate developer , is a feted role model with millions of followers on social media			1
emerging market women leaders are vocal on gender issues , too			0
@entity176 of @entity177 , for example , is one of the most powerful women in @entity179 and is publicly committed to addressing gender parity in her country			0
emerging markets ' ability to couple growth with unprecedented numbers of women in the workforce is good for women , good for their countries ' economy and good for the world			1
while much still remains to be done to ensure that women 's safety , rights , political empowerment and health are more fully secured in these countries , their economic progress to date indicates that change is possible and that economic empowerment can contribute to that change			0
ten years from now , rankings of the most economically competitive -- and the most gender equal -- countries in the world may look very different than they do today			0
only time will tell , but closer competition on gender equality means that there are more winners all around			0
