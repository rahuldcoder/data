-- what do you do if you 're a " crazy kid " growing up in @entity3 ? you clip on your skis and go downhill fast -- very fast -- that 's what			0
" i 'd say most of the time i 'm basically on the verge of crashing , " @entity6 -- the " @entity9 " and arguably the best male skier in the world right now -- told @entity0 's @entity11 series			1
" the fastest way down is just being -- one little slip up and you are done -- so that 's the fastest way to go down			0
we 're riding a fine line most of the time			0
" known as " @entity24 " for his fearless attitude on the piste , @entity6 's approach to gravity -- traveling at speeds that even motorists might start to feel nervous about -- has served him well since making his pro debut a decade ago			1
see @entity6 's downhill run via headcam " for me i think it 's one of the most fun sports out there too because it 's such an adrenaline rush -- you 're just using gravity , " he said			1
" we have courses where you reach speeds of 100 mph ( 160 kph ) so it 's very unique in those ways			0
" securing a stunning hat - trick of titles at this month 's world skiing championships in the @entity44 resort of @entity45 , the 28 - year - old from @entity47 matched a feat last achieved by the legendary @entity49 back in 1968			1
in doing so he all but singlehandedly hoisted the @entity51 to the top of the medals table in @entity44			1
those victories in the super-g , super combined and his specialty giant slalom , where he was defending his 2011 title , showed @entity6 's all - round versatility and catapulted him to superstar status			1
no - nonsense approach not that he is letting his recent success go to his head			2
the @entity51 has even bigger goals ahead -- trying to overhaul @entity44 @entity64 at the top of this season 's overall @entity67 standings and then challenging for gold at the @entity70			1
" i still believe the overall ( @entity67 ) title winner is the no. 1 skier in the world , " @entity6 said			1
" i have been having a great season but i 'm a little way back in the overall , so to me @entity64 is the no. 1 in the world			0
" i had a really hot couple of weeks and luckily that fell during the world championships			0
i am hopeful i can continue the success of the worlds into the other events besides giant slalom			0
" @entity6 's no - nonsense approach and relentless quest for improvement means he has swerved the media hullabaloo which accompanies his fellow @entity51 teammates such as @entity90 and @entity91			1
" i 'm not doing ski racing to become famous			0
i do it because i love it and i 'm competitive			0
that 's what drives me			0
my main focus is on ski racing , not the red carpet , " he states on his official website			0
@entity90 's fall in the women 's super-g at @entity45 , suffering a serious knee injury , brought her season to a premature end , and with @entity91 still recovering from a knee injury of his own , @entity6 might have to start getting used to a more intensive media glare			1
unexpected triumph suddenly all the attention is on him , and even he admits that his success was a little unexpected			0
" i knew i had very good chances at medals in both the super-g and combined , but to win both was definitely a surprise , " he said			2
" my main goal for the worlds was to defend my giant slalom title , so winning the super-g and combined added a little extra pressure			2
" i was so focused on the giant slalom i did n't realize what i had done until it was over			0
though it 's still hard to fathom that i won three golds and that it has not been done since @entity128 in 1968			2
" there is also the smaller matter of @entity70 , where @entity6 hopes to add to the @entity132 gold he won as a 21 - year - old in the super combined at the @entity134 in @entity135			1
@entity6 insists he is " not focused on the @entity136 yet " but memories of his earlier success leave a warm glow			1
" winning the gold medal in the @entity134 was pretty surreal , " he said			0
" i still kind of shake my head when i think about winning the gold medal because i was so young and it was really cool to win the gold			2
to hear the national anthem and stand on top of the podium was a really surreal experience			0
" while his career is on an upward trajectory , @entity6 downplays suggestions that he will be carrying main @entity51 hopes at the @entity153 resort next february			1
" it 's far enough away so much can change between now and then			0
@entity91 and @entity90 should be healthy for the @entity136 so we will have a very strong team besides myself			2
" commercial venture that 2006 victory opened up other commercial opportunities , and @entity6 cleverly exploited his nickname to start a similarly - titled company specializing in custom - made helmet and goggle combinations			1
" i was a crazy kid and would go straight line moguls and was willing to push myself to another level			0
and , you know , it rhymes with @entity6 , so ' @entity24 ' was what i was called			1
" @entity6 may have had a wild streak as a teenager , but he has adopted the same levelheaded approach to business as his skiing career , partnering a friend who brought technical expertise to the venture			2
" it 's nice to have the distraction of running a company			0
i would n't say i do the day - to - day business side of it just because it would be impossible with my schedule , but it 's a fun distraction to take it away from the grind of always traveling and ski racing			0
" his products are worn by a growing number of fellow @entity67 skiers , including @entity190 , a young @entity191 who beat @entity6 into third place as he claimed his maiden @entity67 giant slalom win at @entity194 last weekend			1
it was a rare defeat in giant slalom this season for @entity6 , who has taken advantage of a change in the length of skis and their turning circle to dominate the discipline			2
outspoken critic ironically , @entity6 was an outspoken critic of the rule changes introduced by world governing body , the @entity209 , and was perplexed that as a leading competitor he was n't consulted on the changes			2
" i was n't even talked to about it or asked if i thought it was a good idea , it just happened and i thought it was done in a very improper manner , " he said			0
he quickly put that lack of consultation to one side when he won an early - season race by more than two and a half seconds -- the margins are usually tenths of seconds -- and @entity6 is still waiting for the rest of the world to catch up			1
the @entity51 believes the new regulations play to his strengths as a near 10 - year veteran of the circuit and because of his style of starting the turns around the gates a little earlier and finishing a little later			1
" it allows me to be cleaner on the edge and accelerate more out of the turns , " he said			0
using gravity as a youngster he was inspired by the exploits of @entity238 -- " my first ski hero " -- who won gold and silver at the 1994 @entity136 in @entity243			1
skiing since the age of two , @entity6 started competing seriously as a 10 - year - old , progressing through the ranks to make the full @entity51 ski team by the team he had left high school			1
however , his early @entity132 success in @entity135 , becoming the first @entity51 since @entity238 to claim a skiing gold , was not matched in the @entity252 in @entity253 where he finished fifth behind teammate @entity91 in his super combined title defense			1
a ninth place finish in the giant slalom was also a disappointment			0
but 2011 saw @entity6 claim his first world title , winning the giant slalom at @entity194 and then going on to clinch his third @entity67 crown in his favored discipline			2
for @entity6 , the 2013 - 14 season will bring promise of finally winning the overall @entity67 title -- " that 's been my goal since i was a little kid " -- and truly cementing his status as the @entity269 racer			1
" i think a lot of guys are faster skiers than me but they might not necessarily have the same mental fortitude as me , " he said			0
@entity6 will spend the offseason hanging out with friends , taking part in other sports such as mountain biking and keeping track of the progress of his favorite basketball team -- the @entity281			2
then the hard work will begin in his quest for @entity67 and @entity132 glory : six months on the road with the @entity51 team when he hopes to fulfill his remaining ambitions in alpine racing			1
" i just try to work hard and play hard and have fun with it			0

@entity6 won three gold medals at the 2013 @entity293 in @entity45
the 28 - year - old @entity51 first man for 45 years to achieve the hat - trick
@entity6 won super combined @entity132 gold at the 2006 @entity136
nicknamed " @entity24 " for his fearless *behavior* as a young skier
