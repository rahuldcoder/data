" i saw a headline for an article in one of those things in the supermarket saying that you were married allready			0
i am sure they made it up , but i allmost broke down right then and there and i have still been sick for the last several days			0
" but it was n't all love talk			0
the man , who the @entity12 said was a @entity146 veteran , talked politics			2
in one letter he said he wanted to raise taxes on the rich , cut taxes for anyone who does't make enough money " to live at an acceptable level " and give them free health care			0
he was also for a balanced federal budget			0
" i believe that even if the rich people of this nation paid very high rates on their upper levels of income that they would still live better than over 99 % of the people on this planet , " he wrote to @entity7			1
he worried his political views might keep her from loving him back			0
" you might not think much of a guy who wants you to send most of your money to the federal government			0
i hope that you do not hold that against me but i will understand if you do			0
" after the 79th letter to @entity7 -- and 16 to her family , friends and business associates -- an @entity12 agent knocked on the door of his " small , cluttered one - room apartment , " the @entity12 files said			1
he explained that he would never do physical harm to anyone , but his letter 's reference to doing something " crazy or stupid or really dumb " meant the possibility that he would go on tv 's " the @entity186 " to talk about his love for @entity7			1
