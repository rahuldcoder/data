-- i feel incredibly lucky to have the health and the years needed to run a marathon in each of the 50 states			1
when i was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma nine years ago , only half of newly diagnosed patients survived more than five years			2
since then , i 've run 70 marathons , the most recent in @entity9 , my 50th state			1
hot , exhausted , sore , bent a little to the right , and walking a lot , i finally trotted across that finish line in @entity15			1
i 'm sure i had a big grin on my face because it was the end of a long quest , the completion of which was never a certainty			2
there are more people who climb @entity24 each year than there are runners who finish 50 states of marathons			1
i remember laughing a little , feeling a mixture of joy and relief , as i limped to the table where i could pick up my finisher 's shirt and medal			2
i did n't dare sit down at first , afraid that my muscles would cramp up -- i had to keep walking for a few minutes at least			2
but muscles recover , and i was soon off to the other events of the day : an interview , then to collect my wife and daughter ( who also ran the full marathon )			1
we checked out of the hotel and hustled to catch a plane , where i could finally relax			0
@entity49 came easily , even on the plane			0
' @entity52 ' favorite overcomes @entity53 's , @entity54 's since then , the @entity55 has accepted my documentation , so i 'm a certified " @entity57			0
" it 's done and official			0
right now i 'm savoring the temporary freedom from goals and running just for the joy of it			1
one big reason that i can run with myeloma is a drug called pomalidomide			1
it 's just a little red pill that i take every night			0
it does n't cure the cancer but has kept it at bay for almost five years , without the severe side effects and clinic visits of regular chemotherapy			1
it 's a miracle drug for me			2
a cookbook for cancer treatment when i started taking pomalidomide , it was an investigational drug , not yet approved by the @entity77			1
i wish that life - saving experimental drugs such as it could be much more widely available to people whose lives are threatened by illness			2
happily , pomalidomide has been approved by the @entity77 and will be available to those who need it soon , marketed under the name @entity86			0
it has the potential to do for thousands more what it has done for me			0
we do n't know what 's next for us yet , but whatever it is we 'll continue to do it as a family			0
my wife and daughter have 48 states , including their marathons and their half - marathons , so we 'll certainly run in their remaining states , @entity104 and @entity105			1
and whatever we do , it will be in support of worthy charities			0
live one day at a time and make it a masterpiece			0
