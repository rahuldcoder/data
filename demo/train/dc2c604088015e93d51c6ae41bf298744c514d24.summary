@entity0 -- the @entity2 on friday ordered re-testing of all radiation - emitting full - body scanners after an internal review showed calculation errors , missing data and other discrepancies on paperwork by contractors who routinely check the machines ' radiation levels			1
as recently as wednesday , the agency vouched for the safety of the machines , with homeland security secretary @entity18 telling a @entity20 committee that independent studies concluded the machines are " more then safe			0
" " the amount of radiation is approximately ( the same as that received ) as two minutes in the air , " @entity23 said			0
the @entity2 reiterated that position friday , characterizing problems as " record - keeping errors			1
" but sen. @entity32 , @entity33 , said the @entity2 found problems with more than one - quarter of the reports it reviewed , " including gross errors about radiation emissions			1
" " that is completely unacceptable when it comes to monitoring radiation , " @entity40 said			0
" if @entity2 contractors reporting on the radiation levels have done such a poor job , how can airline passengers and crew have confidence in the data used by the @entity2 to reassure the public ? " the @entity2 said all " backscatter " full body scanners will be re-tested by the end of march , the @entity2 said			2
it will also require contractors to re-train machine testers , while increasing @entity2 oversight over the tests			1
further , the @entity2 said it would ask the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) to update its 2008 report			2
the announcements came as the @entity2 , responding to public pressure , posted raw data about radiation tests on its website			0
the agency also promised to post all future radiation checks on the web site for public review			0
the @entity2 said its internal review looked at randomly selected reports generated over the last two years at 15 airports			2
the tests are conducted by manufacturers and contractors			0
" these reports confirm that each piece of technology reviewed meets all national safety standards , " the @entity2 said			1
but , the @entity2 said , the reports contained " inaccuracies			2
" those inaccuracies included " calculation errors not impacting safety , " no reading of background radiation levels , and missing " non-measurement related information			0
" @entity2 spokesman @entity88 said friday that numerous independent tests have confirmed that body scanners are safe , " but these record - keeping errors are not acceptable			1
" " we 're taking a number of steps to ensure the mistakes are n't repeated and the public will be able to see for themselves by reviewing all future reports online , " @entity88 said			0
@entity99 , president of a privacy rights group and a critic of the full - body scanners , said the latest development is " more evidence " that the @entity2 should suspend use of the machines			1
a @entity108 government oversight subcommittee will hold a hearing on @entity2 oversight of the full - body scanners on wednesday .			1
