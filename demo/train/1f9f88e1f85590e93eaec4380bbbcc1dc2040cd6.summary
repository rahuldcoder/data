@entity0 , @entity1 -- what happens to the 3,100 students who enrolled in fake classes and now have a degree stamped with the seal of the @entity1 , @entity0 -- an institution consistently ranked among the nation 's top public schools ? likely nothing			1
the @entity12 is currently reviewing a scathing report , prepared by former federal prosecutor @entity14 , which showed thousands of @entity1 students took fraudulent classes , some of them multiple times			1
but @entity20 , the president of the association -- which is charged with accrediting degree - granting higher education institutions in the @entity23 , from @entity24 to @entity25 -- told @entity2 that her group ca n't take away degrees			1
" @entity1 has to verify every degree they give all the time			2
we ask them to make sure all courses really are legitimate , " @entity20 said			0
" all we can do ... is put them on sanction for lack of integrity			0
" as far as taking those degrees back , there 's nothing we can do			2
" @entity1 officials told @entity2 say they are still deciding how to try to remedy the fact that so many students graduated with credits from the so - called " paper classes " on their transcripts			1
some students earned many credits taking multiple " gpa booster " classes			0
one student was enrolled in 19 different paper classes , @entity14 said			1
" we 're considering options on these matters and are working closely with @entity12 to evaluate possible courses of action , " said spokesman @entity52			0
@entity1 report : 18 years of academic fraud expert : ' nearly impossible ' to take away degrees @entity62 , president of the @entity63 for academic integrity in collegiate sport and the former president of the @entity67 , called the @entity1 fraud the largest and most nefarious academic scandal in the history of the @entity71			1
" the depth and breadth of the scheme -- involving counselors , coaches , academic administrators , faculty , athletic administrators , etc. -- eclipses any previous case , " @entity62 said			0
but , while @entity62 believes the @entity71 should punish the university , he does not think that the students could lose the legitimacy of their degrees			0
" lifting diplomas from students who were advised to take these classes is nearly impossible , " he said			0
the last time @entity12 investigated the paper classes -- when @entity1 insisted they existed on a much smaller scale -- the association made @entity1 offer new classes to students who had been enrolled in the fake ones			1
but the enrollment in the remedy class was optional , @entity20 said			0
@entity1 told @entity2 that 11 students opted to retake a class			2
the suspect classes were started by a professor 's assistant in the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) who had sympathy for those at the school who were " not the best and the brightest			2
" that assistant , @entity109 , and professor @entity110 then worked with several advisers in athletics to help student - athletes on the brink of eligibility keep their gpas up , according to the report			2
one former football player , @entity118 , told @entity2 earlier this year that his adviser told him to major in @entity102 , and then put him in several paper classes , even though he had interest in majoring in something else			1
from emails that were attached to @entity14 's report , it 's clear that some athletes were placed in these classes because they were struggling			1
one email , written by former women 's basketball academics adviser @entity130 , suggests an athlete is only enrolled in " two real courses			0
" other emails show how counselors were calculated in adding , then dropping , and shifting athletes from class to class trying to keep them eligible to play			0
@entity1 fake class scandal and @entity71 's response wind their way to @entity142 report : nearly half of 3,100 students were athletes this all comes as no surprise to whistleblower @entity148			1
she sounded the alarm on paper classes and was a lone voice against the university when it insisted that the whole scheme fell to the shoulders of @entity157 and @entity109 alone			1
@entity148 told @entity2 that many people were involved and that the paper classes were used as a crutch for underprepared athletes			1
she said that in january -- a month before the @entity162 and his firm , @entity163 , was hired by @entity1 to do another investigation into what happened over the last two decades			2
whistleblower in @entity1 paper class case files lawsuit what @entity162 found was significantly bigger than what @entity1 had admitted to for the last five years			1
nearly half of the 3,100 students were athletes			0
" a good number of these student - athletes were " steered " to the @entity102 paper classes by certain academic counselors in @entity180 , " @entity14 's report says			1
his report says paper classes served as " @entity184 boosters " for athletes who were on the brink of eligibility			1
why ? @entity148 says it 's because they were admitted to @entity1 just to play -- and they could n't keep up in the classroom the way they could keep up on the field , she says			1
@entity148 has been attacked for saying that			0
one @entity1 official even publicly said she was lying			2
now , the 131 - page report and hundreds of supplemental documents appear to back her up			0
@entity148 sat at her kitchen table this week , watching the @entity1 admit to nearly two decades of academic fraud			2
all she could think about were the athletes she tutored who she says were terribly unprepared for real classes at @entity1			1
many , she says , could barely read			0
" i think about where they are , you know , what are they doing , " she said , sitting at that same table the next day			0
" it 's hard to find a lot of those guys			0
and so i was wondering if they were paying any attention to this and if it had any meaning for them			0
" federal education privacy rules forbid the university from publicly identifying the students involved in the paper classes			1
@entity1 in january : we failed students ' for years ' @entity223 : ' we tried to do the right thing ' @entity1 said the @entity162 report came to a different conclusion than previous investigations because he had the cooperation of @entity157 and @entity109 , who previously were n't talking			1
@entity110 was charged with fraud -- a charge later dropped when he began cooperating with @entity14			0
but it 's unclear why previous investigations did not uncover the damning emails , or whether the statements of the athletic advisers were different in the past			0
the latest one , though , did find that some coaches knew what was happening			0
former head football coach @entity241 , for instance , told investigators he knew of the paper classes			1
his successor , @entity244 , who was fired a few years back for his role , also admitted some knowledge			0
the investigators made no findings about @entity249 , the legendary basketball coach and sports icon who coached 36 years at @entity1			2
and the current basketball coach , @entity223 , has adamantly denied knowing anything			0
reacting saturday to the report , @entity223 told reporters " it 's a very sad time for me " as not only @entity1 's head basketball coach , but also a former assistant coach and student there			1
as to what happens next , @entity223 said he does n't see anything in @entity162 's report pertaining to " men 's basketball that somebody can immediately look at and say this is going to happen or this is not going to happen			1
" " the thing about it is that we tried to do the right thing , " the coach said			0
" i ca n't determine what the @entity71 is going to do			2
" @entity2 analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like fifth - graders @entity2 's @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			2

accrediting group : ca n't take degrees from those who took fraudulent classes
@entity1 could be sanctioned for the fraud , this group 's president says
report by investigator found advisers *funneled* athletes to " paper classes "
men 's hoops coach : " very sad time " for @entity1 ; " we tried to do the right thing "
