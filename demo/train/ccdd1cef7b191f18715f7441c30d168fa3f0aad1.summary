@entity2 , @entity3 , public schools suspended their @entity4 after an administrative law judge ruled it violated a new state law and the state said the local district was going to lose $ 15 million in annual aid , officials said			1
the @entity10 of the @entity11 voted late tuesday to suspend immediately the @entity12 , marking a turning point in a yearlong controversy over a new state law banning certain ethnic studies			1
" the district shall revise its social studies core curriculum to increase its coverage of @entity23 - @entity22 history and culture , including a balanced presentation of diverse viewpoints on controversial issues			0
the end result shall be a single common social studies core sequence through which all high school students are exposed to diverse viewpoints , " the governing board said in a statement			2
" the district shall study and bring to the board new measures designed to narrow the achievement gaps for traditionally underserved and economically disadvantaged students , " the board said			0
the board action came in the wake of friday 's order by @entity43 superintendent @entity42 to withhold 10 % -- or about $ 15 million a year -- of state aid to the @entity2 district retroactive to august 15 , 2011 , according to a copy of the order posted on the district 's website			1
the state superintendent 's order was , in turn , made after last month 's ruling by an administrative law judge that found the program 's curriculum was teaching @entity59 history and culture " in a biased , political , and emotionally charged manner , " and upheld state officials ' findings that it violated a state law passed in 2010			1
the @entity11 had appealed a decision by the law 's chief backer , then - state schools superintendent @entity69 , to shut down the program			1
@entity69 left office at the end of 2010 , but his successor , @entity42 , backed @entity69 's ruling in june			0
under the law , the state can withhold 10 % of its funding for the school district until the district changes the course			1
during their appeal , district officials pointed out that an audit commissioned by @entity42 praised the program and found " no observable evidence " that the classes violated state law			1
a witness for the school system argued that teaching students " historical facts of oppression and racism " was less likely to promote " racial resentment " -- something specifically banned by the 2010 law -- than ignoring that history			2
in last month 's ruling , administrative law judge @entity99 said the auditors observed only a limited number of classes			1
he added , " teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased , political , and emotionally charged manner			0
" @entity2 educators who have challenged the constitutionality of the new law in court have defended the @entity4 as no different than @entity22 or native american studies classes			1
@entity2 school board member @entity112 has charged that the new law provided no due process and was unconstitutional			1
she has said the new law is part of an anti-immigrant political climate in the @entity3 statehouse			0
at tuesday night 's meeting , @entity112 unsuccessfully urged the board to preserve the program , saying the district should appeal , according to @entity123 affiliate @entity122			2
" this is a group of passionate people about their education and the education of their children			0
this is not a militarized group that wants to overthrow the government			0
this is not a group that is seeking ethnic solidarity			0
this is a group that wants their children to understand about their culture and their role in our @entity22 history and our lives , " @entity112 said during the board meeting			0
@entity112 was the sole " no " vote in the board 's 4 - 1 decision to suspend the program			2
the new schools law is the latest controversy in a state already roiled by an immigration crackdown law , known as @entity152 , that is being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court			2
the @entity3 - @entity156 border is considered the nation 's busiest for illegal immigration			0
the law authorizes the state superintendent to stop any ethnic studies classes that promote the overthrow of the @entity164 government , promote resentment toward a race or class of people , are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals .			0
