-- the number of @entity4 fighting off hunger stayed level last year , though food insecurity rates remain the highest they have been since the federal government began keeping track 15 years ago , a @entity2 report released monday found			1
about 14.7 percent of @entity4 households were " food insecure " in 2009 , meaning they had difficulty feeding one or more of their members at some point last year due to a lack of financial resources , according to the report			1
that equates to 17.4 million households total , or roughly 45 million people			0
this year 's rate marked a slight increase in percentage from 2008 , when 14.6 percent of @entity27 households had trouble putting food on the table			2
the situation was especially dire for more than one - third of those households -- 6.8 million total , equating to 5.7 percent of all @entity4 households -- that the report 's four authors classified as having " very low food security			1
" this number , too , changed little in 2009 compared to the previous year			2
a lack of resources prompted one or more members of these households to eat much less or otherwise adjust their eating patterns			0
the typical household in this category struggled with food issues for at least a few days a month over seven months of the year , the report said			2
households headed by single parents were more likely to struggle with food insecurity than those with two parents at home			1
hunger - related issues were more prevalent among @entity27 and @entity56 households than white ones , the study found			2
access to food was also more common in large cities than in rural areas , exurbs or suburbs			0
most of those classified as " food insecure " reported getting benefits from the federal government 's three main anti-hunger initiatives : the @entity72 , the @entity70 and the @entity71 , better known as @entity71			0
in a press release , the @entity4 @entity2 reported that 18.7 percent more people had participated in the former program in 2009 over 2008			1
rates also rose for the " free lunch " program ( up 5.4 percent ) and @entity71 ( up 5.8 percent )			0
" this report highlights just how critical federal nutrition assistance programs are for @entity27 families , " @entity2 under secretary for food , nutrition and consumer services @entity78 said in a statement			1
the annual report from the @entity84 extrapolated from surveys of 46,000 households conducted on the @entity2 's behalf by the @entity88			0
people responded to questions such as their ability to afford balanced meals , whether they adjusted the size of meals due to lack of money , or if they ever went hungry due to a lack of financial resources .			0

" food insecurity " rates in the @entity4 changed little from 2008 to 2009 , a report says
levels of fighting hunger are as high as they *'ve* been since *record* - keeping began
participation in federal food assistance programs increased over the past year
