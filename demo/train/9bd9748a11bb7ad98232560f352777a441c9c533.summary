-- president @entity1 needs to learn a simple lesson : saying something does n't make it true			2
though the president has claimed victory touting 8 million " enrollments " under his health care law , @entity5 can not and will not wipe their memories clear of the botched rollout and continual failings of @entity13			1
@entity14 have sustained their tactic of telling everyone the health care law is working , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary			2
perhaps if they say it enough , their reasoning goes , it will become true			0
well , @entity1 can have his own opinions and he can even assert falsehoods as truth , but he ca n't conjure fact			2
a new @entity30 / @entity29 poll lays the facts out bare			0
the president 's approval rating has slipped to 41 % -- the lowest of his presidency in @entity30 / @entity29 polls			1
and only 37 % approve of the president 's handling of @entity13 's implementation			1
despite the 8 million enrollees vaunted by the administration , a mere 44 % of @entity5 approve of the president 's signature law			1
this negative view of @entity13 persists even upon the assumption , parroted by many in the media , that the 8 million enrollment figure is accurate			1
however , the administration refuses to tell the @entity5 people any details about that number			0
how many of those " enrollees " are insured , having paid their first month 's premium ? how many were previously uninsured ? how many were forced off their former coverage that they liked ? what will the quality of coverage be for those who actually receive coverage ? these questions have been met with deaf ears and defensive posturing			1
" the debate over the repeal of the law is over , " the president said			0
" this law is doing what it 's supposed to do -- it 's working			2
" the president has confused reported high enrollment numbers with success , disregarding that while millions may be signed up under threat of penalty , @entity5 are not sold on the failed law			0
to provide @entity5 answers to the unanswered questions , the @entity77 passed in january the @entity80 , which would require transparency from the administration regarding the @entity13 insurance exchange			2
yet @entity85 majority leader @entity84 has blocked the bill in the @entity85 , unwilling to give the @entity5 people access to information they have a right to know			0
in an attempt to get the data directly from the source , the @entity90 sent letters in march to every insurance provider participating in the federal exchange requesting enrollment data , including the number of individuals who have paid their first month 's premium or were previously uninsured			1
the results finally came in			0
as of april 15 , only 67 % of individuals and families that selected a plan had paid their first month 's premium , data provided to the committee by every provider in the @entity106 shows			1
insurers informed the committee that , by the same date , only 2.45 million had paid their first month 's premium for coverage obtained through the @entity106			1
the purpose of @entity13 , if the president remembers , was to insure , not merely to sign up , and it seems the president 's enrollment numbers far surpass the number of insured			1
of those who have enrolled and paid their premiums , some surely liked their health insurance , were renewing their health insurance and were booted off their health insurance because of @entity13 regulations			1
this law is not a success			0
even before the @entity90 released their findings , @entity5 still viewed @entity13 unfavorably			2
in tuesday 's @entity30 / @entity29 poll , 47 % of @entity5 reported that the @entity13 has raised their health care costs and 60 % blame @entity13 for increasing costs nationally			1
@entity5 -- faced with @entity13 's burdens and disappointed with the president 's handling of the economy , foreign policy , and more -- want a @entity139 - controlled @entity138 to act as a check on the president 's policies by 53 to 39 %			1
the debate is far from over , mr. president			0
instead of taking responsibility for the failed health care law , @entity1 prefers to call major problems " glitches " and forced re-enrollment of millions who were previously insured " success			0
" he has claimed victory with a number that includes millions who remain uninsured			0
the first step toward fixing a problem is admitting the problem exists			0
instead of taking responsibility for the disaster they 've created and the unnecessary hardships they 've imposed on the @entity5 people , @entity1 and the @entity14 are trying to rewrite the facts			0
unfortunately for them , facts do n't work that way			2
join us on @entity170 / @entity169 .			0

rep. @entity172 : selling of @entity13 omits the *reality* that not everyone is paying
eight million " enrollees " does n't equal 8 million paid *customers* , he says
@entity181 : only 67 % of enrollees had paid first month 's premium
