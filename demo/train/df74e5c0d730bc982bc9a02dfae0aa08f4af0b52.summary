@entity0 -- the names involved in the escalating crisis in @entity4 -- @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 -- make it sound far away and far removed from @entity9 's allies and its interests			1
but the tensions there in fact hit very close to home for the @entity9			2
first , @entity4 is not a distant empire but an integral part of @entity17			0
its capital , @entity19 , is just a short flight from cities @entity9 visit all the time : @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25			0
and , it is neighbors with some of @entity9 's closest allies			2
just along its western border are @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34			0
all four are members of @entity36 and , as a result , the @entity9 is obligated to defend them militarily if they come under threat			0
@entity4 is not a @entity36 member , but there had been discussions in recent years of enhancing ties			0
second , a tug of war is playing out inside @entity4 between @entity44 and @entity45			0
president @entity46 has said the @entity4 crisis is not part of " some @entity50 chessboard , " but @entity50 - era divisions are evident on the ground			2
@entity4 's east is predominantly ethnic @entity55 and @entity55 speaking			1
the percentage is as high as 75 % in the easternmost areas			0
@entity4 's west , by contrast , is dominated by ethnic @entity4			0
in the westernmost areas , fewer than 5 % speak @entity55			0
@entity46 : @entity9 weighing steps to ' isolate @entity55 ' over @entity4 crisis those cultural and historic divisions pull western @entity4 toward the @entity45 and @entity17 , and eastern @entity4 into the arms of @entity55			1
now , it is not black and white			0
even in the hotly contested @entity5 peninsula , two out of five residents are not @entity55			2
but @entity4 's demographic map displays a clear division , which is now playing out in cities and towns and -- it appears -- even inside military bases			2
" to be sure , there is an @entity77 divide in @entity4 , but i think it 's often overstated in the @entity45 , " said @entity74 , a former @entity9 ambassador to @entity4			1
" certainly in the last two decades of @entity4 's independence , that line has blurred a lot , " @entity74 said			0
" bear in mind , in eastern @entity4 , while the majority of the people there may speak @entity55 , it 's still a majority population that are ethnic @entity4			1
the only place in @entity4 where @entity55 are an ethnic majority is @entity5			1
" " my sense is that in eastern @entity4 while they might not be wholly comfortable with what has happened in @entity19 in the last 10 days , they are not talking about separatism			0
it 's a very big distinction between eastern @entity4 and @entity5			1
third , as secretary of state @entity95 said sunday , @entity55 's military intervention violates international law , the @entity98 charter and several post-war military agreements -- all of which designed to keep the peace in @entity17 following several 20th century wars			1
@entity55 's violation of those agreements calls into question its ability to keep the peace going forward as well as basic principles such as the sanctity of international borders			1
@entity95 rebukes @entity55 's ' incredible act of aggression ' in move into @entity4 @entity55 is claiming that ethnic @entity55 in @entity4 are calling for @entity55 help , a claim with little so far to support it on the ground			1
and , looking forward , experts note there are many more @entity55 in , for instance , the @entity121 state of @entity122 , which , unlike @entity4 , is a @entity36 ally			2
what would happen if @entity55 did the same there ? so what are @entity55 's interests ? why would it risk so much for a seemingly tiny corner of @entity4			1
the answer lies with one of those distant - sounding places mentioned at the start of the piece : @entity6			0
@entity5 caught in a ' war of information ' @entity6 is home to the base of @entity55 's @entity137			1
it is @entity55 's only warm - water port , the only port @entity55 has that provides access to the @entity143 , the @entity144 and the @entity145 year - round			1
this is an essential tool for projecting @entity55 military power abroad			0
when @entity4 's government abruptly shifted from @entity149 to @entity151 following protests in @entity19 , @entity55 appeared to identify a threat to its core interests			1
" i think what were really seeing are the initial steps in some form â € ” maybe premature on my part , but that 's ok -- of an annexation by @entity55 , " said retired @entity162 gen. @entity161 , a @entity1 contributor			2
its response is the massive military intervention the world is witnessing right now			2
@entity161 said the key thing is to ensure that the crisis does n't escalate			0
" i think the @entity9 and the international community is probably going to have to accept a half a loaf -- in other words , the annexation of @entity5 may be a fait accompli			1
we have to accept that and have to acknowledge that if ( @entity55 president @entity180 ) @entity179 is not going to act against @entity4 , it 's certainly in our best interest , " @entity161 said			1
" this might , in fact , be @entity183 of containment -- in fact i 'd suggest it is			0

@entity4 *uprising* stokes @entity50 tensions
@entity4 *melting* pot of cultures and *loyalties* *complicates* politics
@entity55 's military intervention calls into question sanctity of international borders
@entity9 , international community may have to accept @entity55 annexation of @entity5 , if it occurs
