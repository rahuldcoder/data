@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 has voted that former finance minister @entity4 should face criminal prosecution for allegedly wiping the names of at least three relatives from a list of more than 2,000 @entity3 with @entity10 bank accounts			1
the list of those with accounts at a @entity15 branch of @entity16 is known as the " @entity8 , " because it was given by @entity17 , then @entity18 's finance minister , to her @entity3 counterpart in august 2010			1
however , its existence was not revealed until september 2012			2
information that the list had been misplaced , copied and altered so as to exclude certain names then started coming to light , causing a major uproar			0
the three charges against @entity4 are breach of trust , doctoring an official document and dereliction of duty			2
if convicted , he faces a prison sentence			0
@entity4 served as finance minister from october 2009 to june 2011 , and was finance minister when @entity3 negotiated its first international bailout			1
because he is a lawmaker , @entity2 has to approve the lifting of immunity before any prosecution can proceed			1
in a secret ballot late monday , 220 deputies in the 300 - seat @entity2 voted in favor of the former minister being prosecuted for at least one charge , and 166 for all three			0
addressing lawmakers before the vote , @entity4 denied wrongdoing and said he was being targeted " for one simple reason , being the finance minister who put the country in the bailout process			2
" a council of judges will convene , probably later this week , to decide whether @entity4 should face the criminal charges outlined in @entity2			1
while it is not illegal to hold a @entity10 bank account , and there is no evidence that anyone broke the law , suspicions are high in @entity3 that some of those named in the list may have opened the accounts to avoid paying taxes to the @entity3 state			1
a parliamentary committee was set up last year to look into why no investigation was carried out under either @entity4 or his successor as finance minister , @entity71			0
@entity3 media questioned whether the failure to investigate those named for possible tax evasion might have been the result of an attempt by politicians to protect a wealthy elite			0
@entity17 is now the @entity80 chief			0
journalist @entity81 reported in @entity0 and @entity1 's @entity82 wrote in @entity83 .			0
