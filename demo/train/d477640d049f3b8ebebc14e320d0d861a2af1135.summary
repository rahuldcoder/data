-- if the one great book of @entity4 popular music is ever written , @entity1 might not even need his own chapter			1
he has a solo -- or a harmony part , or a lead vocal , or a single perfect guitar lick -- in all the important chapters of the past 50 years			0
@entity1 , who died on tuesday at age 89 , is most closely associated with the melodic style of flatpicking that cemented the guitar 's role as a solo voice in bluegrass and acoustic country music			1
but unlike the three - finger " @entity21 style " named after banjo pioneer @entity22 , who crossed musical paths with @entity1 a number of times across the decades , there is n't a single " @entity1 style			1
" the flatpicking turned heads , but the tune that followed it might be a fingerstyle blues , a @entity34 - flavored country bounce or a parlor song from the @entity37 repertoire			0
@entity1 was a master tailor , not a designer ; he fitted techniques to the needs of the song or the generations of players who sat next to him , as if they had been designed that way from the start			1
@entity1 , blind from childhood , took an understated pride in being able to support his family independently			1
he was already a seasoned local and regional performer , playing both old - time music and what he called " rockabilly and pop standards , " when the folk boom of the 1960s put him in front of a new set of audiences with his voice , banjo and acoustic guitar			1
for some performers , the welcome influx of new audiences also brought calls for a change in repertoire			2
@entity1 merely changed gears ; he was comfortable with the ballads and tunes he 'd grown up with , and he was equally deft at re-creating the brother duets he had heard on the radio when he played them with their author , @entity74 , the prickly creator of bluegrass music			1
by the late 1960s , @entity1 was well known to urban folk audiences and increasingly in the country stronghold of @entity79 as well ; he had even joined @entity21 and @entity80 , the former @entity74 sidemen who had become the best - known names in bluegrass , for an instrumental album			1
his neutrality in personal and stylistic feuds reflected his own musical open - mindedness and served him well when the @entity89 was recruiting traditional performers for a three - album tribute to its own country roots , " @entity85			1
" the " @entity98 " helped define the sound of dorm rooms and hallways and the song lists of bar bands			0
audiences that had never listened to the @entity101 itself would applaud the " @entity110 , " and they expected the @entity1 touches that knitted the album together : the instrumental styles , the vocals , the playful treatment of tunes like " @entity109			1
" that milestone album could have capped a career			0
for @entity1 , it was n't even a halfway point ; he had nearly four decades still to go			2
( indeed , he was scheduled to perform next in june with a number of longtime collaborators at a celebration of his work at the @entity119 ) the newly world - famous @entity1 was strikingly consistent with the original			2
he continued to tour primarily with his son , @entity121			0
he recorded music he liked with performers he liked , and he kept an ear out for the generation that was coming up behind him			0
the @entity1 you saw on the national stage or heard on public radio was the same one you saw at small festivals in out - of - the - way parts of @entity131 : intimate , genial , as distinctive playing rhythm as he was in the spotlight			2
there was never a public watershed where @entity1 formally broke with his roots or humbly returned to them			2
his roots were always part of what he did ; he just kept adding new roots			0
that 's not to say there were no changes ; @entity121 's death in a farming accident in 1985 was an unimaginable loss , personally and professionally			0
@entity1 adapted , with the help of players who could tour and play in the way @entity121 had			2
the genre - blending @entity150 , held each year since 1988 as a fundraiser for @entity153 , is a lasting tribute			0
@entity1 continued to record : with country giants like @entity156 , newgrass superstars like @entity158 and @entity159 , and by the end of the century with @entity121 's son @entity161			0
he was onstage with @entity21 again in 2003 -- as " the three pickers , " with @entity163 and such next - generation guests as @entity165 -- in a concert that @entity167 called " one highlight after another			0
" the @entity171 folk rebels of the early 1970s explained their rocked - out child ballads as a way of taking folk music out of museums and giving it back to folks			0
@entity1 made his share of music for museums and dignitaries and international audiences , but it was the same music he would have made in your living room : extraordinary music for ordinary occasions .			1

@entity1 switched gears to adapt to changing musical scene
1960s put him in front of a new set of audiences
@entity89 brought him to an even *broader* audience
