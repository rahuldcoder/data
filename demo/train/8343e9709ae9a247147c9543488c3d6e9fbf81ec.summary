@entity12 , 76 , is a humanitarian with a big mission on the most modest of budgets			0
twice a year , she tries to instill the importance of saving money for college by offering any youth $ 5 -- if and only if the youngsters place that money in a savings account			1
while some may doubt whether such a notion could succeed , @entity12 can count 40 youngsters who took up her offer over the past three years -- and are now going to junior college			1
" the majority of the people who 've opened an account have stayed in school , " said @entity12 at her community center called @entity29 ( pow ) , a nonprofit youth outreach group she began in 1979 to keep kids off the streets and in school			1
on saturday , @entity12 held her latest " back - to - school community event , " in which 96 kids applied for a savings account that holds $ 5 , donated by @entity12 ' organization			1
in exchange for accepting the $ 5 , the youngsters have to pledge that the money will be used for their college education and that the youths will contribute to their own savings over time , @entity12 said			1
@entity12 , who has been living in @entity0 at least since its 1960s riots , said the savings account program teaches youths discipline and the importance of savings -- as well as letting them know she and her group are there to support their college dreams			1
@entity12 operates her micro-giving program through @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity66 , 16 , was one of the many to open an account saturday			2
she hopes to save the money for college , because she says , " @entity71 costs a lot of money			2
" through summer jobs and babysitting in the next few years , she hopes to make her dream possible and wishes to open up her own business one day			0
@entity78 , 13 , of @entity79 , @entity1 , signed up for one of the $ 5 accounts two years ago and now she has saved $ 700 , through an allowance from her mother and cash gifts to her during her birthdays and @entity86			1
she dreams of attending @entity87 at @entity88 -- and wants to become a veterinarian			0
" the other kids , maybe , they want to be spoiled			0
i want to be independent , buy my own car and buy my own house , " @entity78 said at the community center , near a booth set up by the banks			0

" we want to keep encouraging her to save , " said @entity108 , the executive vice president of @entity109 and @entity65			0
" we were very proud of her , she had a lot of discipline in her savings			0
" @entity12 said she gives out the money for the savings accounts through the donations she receives through her community group			1
she feels strongly about the programs she runs because of the inspiration she personally received : it was her own mentor who opened up @entity12 's savings account for her decades ago			1

for @entity12 , the @entity0 riots are n't forgotten : 46 years after the violence , the neighborhood still faces deep problems			2
capt. @entity145 of the @entity9 police 's southeast station said that @entity0 " is a very hard community and influenced by violent street gangs			2
" the four housing projects in @entity0 have traditionally been violent , with large amounts of drug dealing , he said			2
but he applauds how " @entity11 " @entity153 is pushing the youth in the community to be financially independent			2
regarding the $ 5 that @entity12 donates , @entity145 stated : " it 's very symbolic on one hand and on the other hand , probably more money than anyone 's legitimately ever given many of them			1

" @entity11 " @entity4 of @entity0 , @entity1 , gives $ 5 to any kid who wants a saving account
the kids must pledge to stay in school -- and seek to go to college
