@entity0 -- a preliminary @entity3 plan to allow its chaplains to perform same - sex marriages in military chapels after the end of " do n't ask , do n't tell " has fired up congressional opposition			1
all services are moving forward with the transition from the present ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in uniform			0
@entity16 officials are expected to sign off on the new rules and the progress of training in coming weeks			0
an april 13 memo from the @entity3 officer in charge of chaplains says they " may " officiate at same - sex marriages or civil unions , depending on both local laws and their religious organization			1
it is not clear if the other services would have a similar provision			0
" regarding the use of base facilities for same - sex marriages , legal counsel has concluded that , generally speaking , base facility use is sexual orientation - neutral , " rear adm. @entity32 , the @entity3 's chief of chaplains , said in the memo			1
" this is a change to previous training that stated same - sex marriages are not authorized on federal property			2

a letter from rep. @entity53 , @entity54 , to the secretary of the navy asking him to block the change has been signed by 63 members of @entity51 , according to @entity53 's website			1
