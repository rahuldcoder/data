-- it 's 7:20 a.m. and @entity2 has n't worked out yet			2
not a big deal for the 49 % of @entity4 who do n't exercise regularly , but it 's going to bother him all day			2
the problem is the ceo of @entity9 , the company behind @entity11 and @entity9 , does n't like to work out			1
so much so that he sometimes has to " trick " himself into the gym			2
like the time he decided he could n't brush his teeth before he worked out for at least 10 minutes			2
that little ploy inspired @entity9 's 10 - minute trainer program			1
the fitness industry is constantly coming up with similar tricks to get more of us off the couch , @entity2 said			1
the result is a rotation of incoming and outgoing trends -- from @entity28 's @entity27 tapes in the early ' 80s to @entity9 's dvd programs that are popular today			1
@entity2 compares fitness to fashion			1
" somebody starts wearing a certain shoe in @entity34 or @entity35 and suddenly everybody wants to wear it , " he said			2
" it does n't just solve the problem -- like shoes cover your feet			2
it makes you feel like it 's ( a part of ) your identity			2
" @entity46 teaches youth video classes at the @entity48 in @entity49			1
she has a 19 - month - old son and not a lot of time for a workout program that does n't work			2
she tried kickboxing , aerobics and just going to the gym , but nothing really stuck until she got one of this year 's hot trends , @entity11			1
" this is the first actual program i 've done , " she said			0
i feel like i have more energy			0
i 've lost 9 pounds so far			0
" the @entity62 publishes a yearly survey of the top worldwide fitness trends			1
the top 10 list for 2011 includes boot camps and programs aimed at older adults			0
trends depend on many factors , said the survey 's lead author , @entity71			0
take @entity73 , which dropped off the survey 's list from no. 9 last year			0
@entity71 believes the economy made @entity73 equipment and specialized instructors too expensive for clubs to maintain			0
he 's not sure if @entity73 will make a return to the top 20 , but he does n't expect a few of this year 's trends to stick around long			0
" the problem with the high - intensity kind of programs is that they deliver a punch like severe weight loss programs do , but they 're difficult to comply with in the long haul , " he said			0
remember the slide board ? @entity92 ? step aerobics ? all trends @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity98 senior program director @entity97 has seen come and go in her 28 years of teaching group fitness			1
" the reason why programs like that do n't stick is because they 're too hard to do , " she said			0
" the things that really stick are programs that cross over multiple ( ability ) levels			0
" @entity46 said when she first attempted the @entity108 it was " too much " so she dropped it after two weeks			0
but when she started attending a class with an instructor who taught her how to modify the moves , she found herself returning six days a week at 7 a.m. @entity97 cites classes like @entity114 , body pump and spinning as success stories			1
they 're consistent , easy to follow and include that always important element of fun			0
" they make people feel successful , " @entity122 editor - in - chief @entity121 said			0
" that 's a huge key in good programming is to make people feel like ' wow , i get it			0
' " @entity122 is the world 's largest association for fitness and wellness professionals			1
it also does a yearly survey of fitness trends			1
this year , aerobics , water fitness and martial arts - based classes had the largest decline in popularity			1
dance and boot camp classes showed the largest growth			1
" think jazzercise classes -- they 're fun			1
they combine good music , easy choreography ( and ) social aspects , " @entity121 said			0
@entity149 is one of those trends that stuck			1
@entity152 founded the company in 1969 and the dance - based classes are still popular across the world			1
in fact , @entity157 recently named @entity149 2011 's most successful fitness franchise			1
" it 's not like you can take a six - week course and be fit the rest of your life , " @entity152 said			0
" it 's really good that people are coming up with different ways to move			1
i 'm happy for anybody doing anything , anything that gets them off the couch and on their feet			1
" she continues to choreograph routines to approximately 30 new songs every 10 weeks to keep her high member retention rate			0
it is the beauty and curse of the industry , @entity97 said			2
old trends evolve into new ones , forcing gyms to stay cutting edge , but keeping customers excited about working out			0
" the trick only lasts so long , " @entity2 said , going back to his fashion analogy			0
" the best designers are n't looking for trends ; the best designers set the trends			0
