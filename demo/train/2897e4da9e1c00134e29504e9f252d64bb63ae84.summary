billionaire @entity1 media mogul @entity0 says she was the victim of racism on a recent trip to @entity4 when a shop assistant refused to show her a handbag because it was " too expensive			1
" @entity0 was in @entity7 for @entity9 's wedding in late july when she left her hotel alone and popped into an upscale handbag shop			1
she told @entity12 : " i was in @entity7 the other day at a store whose name i will not mention			2
i did n't have my eyelashes on , but i was in full @entity0 gear			0
i had my little @entity20 skirt and sandals , but obviously the @entity22 is not shown in @entity7			0
" " i go into a store and say to the woman , ' excuse me , may i see that bag over your head ? ' and she says to me ' no , it 's too expensive			0
' " @entity0 says she asked again to see the bag -- a $ 38,000 crocodile skin number by @entity34 -- and the woman again refused , saying , " no no no , you do n't want to see that one , you want to see this one , because that one will cost too much and you will not be able to afford that			2
" @entity0 says she asked a final time to see the bag : " one more time i tried -- i said , ' but i really do just want to see that one , ' and she said , ' i do n't want to to hurt your feelings , ' and i said , ' @entity40 thank you so much , you 're probably right , i ca n't afford it and walked out of the store			0
now why did she do that ? " while @entity0 did not specifically identify the shopping trip as a racist experience , she described the incident when asked about her encounters with racism during an interview			1
the talk show host is the first and only female @entity52 - @entity1 billionaire , with an estimated net worth of $ 2.8 billion			1
she said : " i could 've had the big blow up thing and thrown down the black card and all that , but why do that ? " five trailblazer ceos who reinvented their brand @entity0 chose not to identify the shop , but the name of the high - end boutique -- @entity64 -- was soon revealed			2
the shop 's manager told @entity67 the entire incident was a " 200 percent misunderstanding " and had nothing to do with racism			1
" mrs. @entity0 said she just wanted to look at the bag , she did n't want it taken down , and because my sales assistant felt a little embarrassed about the price , she quickly said that she also had the model in other materials such as ostrich and suede , which were n't so expensive , " explained @entity72 , the manager of @entity73			1
calling it a " normal selling discussion , " @entity72 said : " mrs. @entity0 got the impression she did n't want to sell the bag to her because she wanted to show her other bags			2
this had nothing whatsoever to do with racism			0
" " who would n't want to sell a bag like that ? everyone would			0
my saleswoman just wanted to do her best			0
she feels very bad because she feels the way it 's being represented is very unfair			0
" @entity72 added that @entity9 was her " best friend " and that she , like @entity0 , attended the singer 's wedding			1
