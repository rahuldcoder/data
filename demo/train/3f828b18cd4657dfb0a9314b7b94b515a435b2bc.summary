-- november 8 , 1994 : it was a slaughter			2
in one night , @entity2 seized 54 seats in the @entity4 and eight seats in the @entity6 , capturing @entity7 for the first time since 1954			1
the newcomers , many from the @entity10 , were predominantly white , male and angry			0
" you 're going to have a difference in style , " predicted an @entity12 - based @entity2 pollster			1
" with the @entity16 , you get a more aggressive , assertive conservatism			0
this is a conservatism that has been built on confronting @entity20 and liberals , not accommodating them			0
" conservative leaders credited @entity23 , king of angry white men , with propelling the @entity2 revolution			1
" he was the standard by which we ran , " said former house majority leader @entity26			0
the @entity29 , a conservative think tank , invited @entity23 to deliver the keynote at its orientation for new lawmakers			1
@entity23 encouraged the newcomers to stay mean : " this is not the time to get moderate			1
this is not the time to start trying to be liked			0
led by house speaker @entity39 , the angry white men of @entity38 shut down the government and spent the next six years trying to drive @entity41 from office			0
those were the days , my friend			0
we thought they 'd never end			0
november 2 , 2010 : four years after recapturing @entity7 , democrats are again cowering in expectation of a brutal election day beating			2
@entity23 is still angry , but some of this year 's @entity2 candidates take their cues from someone new : @entity54			1
where @entity23 was angry , @entity54 is paranoid			1
in his land of make - believe , devious enemies have infiltrated the government and are plotting to destroy @entity59			2
every significant phenomenon , from the recession to the @entity62 oil spill , is part of their master plan			0
their final objective is a fascist - communist - big brother - world - government - Ã¼ber - tyranny , and they will annihilate anyone who interferes , which is why @entity54 frequently asks listeners to pray for his safety			1
just as @entity2 channeled @entity23 's anger in 1994 , many of today 's @entity2 nominees exhibit @entity54 's paranoia			1
for instance , @entity78 , the @entity2 @entity6 nominee from @entity79 , has described a secret plot to merge the @entity59 into a @entity82 under a single currency , sealed by a colossal 10 - lane highway from @entity85 to @entity86			1
" it 's gon na go up through @entity88 , i guess , all the way to @entity90 , " he explained			2
" if you talk about it like it 's a conspiracy , " he said , " they 'll paint you as a nut			2
... but i guarantee you it 's one of their long - term goals to have one sort of borderless mass continent			2
" @entity101 , a @entity2 congressional nominee from @entity102 , speculated that the government has colluded with @entity62 to create the oil spill : " now , i 'm not necessarily a conspiracy person , but i do n't think enough investigation has been done on this			1
... i do n't know how or why , but in that situation , if you have someone from a company proposing to violate the safety process and the government signing off on it , excuse me : maybe they wanted it to leak			0
" @entity115 , @entity2 @entity6 nominee from @entity116 , has spoken of armed resistance to tyranny			1
" you know , our founding fathers , they put that @entity123 in there for a good reason , and that was for the people to protect themselves against a tyrannical government , " she warned			0
" i hope that 's not where we 're going , but , you know , if this @entity7 keeps going the way it is , people are really looking toward those @entity123 remedies and saying , my goodness , what can we do to turn this country around ? " @entity138 , @entity2 @entity6 nominee from @entity139 , checks for political opponents hiding in her bushes			1
" they 're following me , " she insisted			0
" they follow me home at night			0
i make sure that i come back to the townhouse , and then we have our team come out and check all the bushes and check all the cars to make sure that -- they follow me			2
" some @entity20 have cheered these wild - eyed candidates , believing that extremists wo n't win elections			0
but history contradicts faith in @entity59 ' moderation			0
when militant conservatives seized control of the @entity2 in december 1992 , one @entity20 analyst gloated , " they are silencing the more moderate elements in their party and seeking an ideological purity from the right			1
a marginalized , right - wing @entity2 will be less competitive with @entity41 in 1996 than a more inclusive and centrist @entity2			1
" but while the relatively moderate @entity165 lost to @entity41 , conservative shock troops swarmed into @entity7 and hobbled his presidency			0
the way things are going , the incoming @entity2 of 2010 will make the class of 1994 look like pragmatic centrists			1
if so , we can look forward to years of partisan gridlock and poisonous incriminations			0
in the words of @entity54 , " buckle up , because trouble is coming			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity178 says @entity23 helped propel 1990 's @entity2 revolution
but in 2010 *midterms* , candidates take cues from @entity54 , who uses paranoia
@entity2 candidates such as @entity138 , @entity78 have taken up paranoid theme to tar opponents
@entity178 : @entity2 of 2010 will make class of 1994 look like pragmatic centrists
