they are the latest political pawns in a partisan battle over @entity3 immigration : thousands of children who have risked their lives fleeing poverty and violence in @entity9 seeking " permisos " or a pass to stay in @entity9			1
it is a political chimera that touches on thorny issues like immigration reform , foreign aid , human trafficking and the @entity3 - @entity19 drug trade , which has helped fund violent @entity9 cartels that are destabilizing that region , federal officials told lawmakers at a @entity24 hearing on tuesday			0
during the session , the partisan differences on immigration reform and border security were stark			1
" why are n't we putting them on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to @entity33 ? " @entity35 @entity34 rep. @entity34 asked about the children pouring across the southern border and being held in detention facilities			2
" because the law requires that i turn them over to ( @entity42 ) sir , " responded homeland security secretary @entity39			0
" well the law required @entity45 to be kicked in two years ago and that has n't stopped the administration before when it wants to do something different , " @entity34 replied			2
" this is a humanitarian crisis			0
... it is a national security crisis for our country and i do n't know why these children are being treated any differently			2
" and so it went as lawmakers and federal officials went round and round , hotly debating how best to deal with the thousands of children awaiting their fate in hot , cramped detention facilities and the thousands more expected to flood the southern border by the end of the year			1
" this is a crisis			0
it is a crisis that has been in the making for years , one that we should have seen coming but few concrete actions have been taken , " said committee chairman @entity65			0
" the @entity72 and the @entity3 government as a whole has been slow to act , turning a blind eye to the warning signs , " the @entity71 @entity34 said			0
" the tragic fact is these children are making a dangerous journey based on misinformation and the false promise of amnesty			2
" immigrant children tread treacherous political landscape partisan back and forth @entity85 blame the @entity86 and say relaxed deportation policies toward immigrant kids and their families are encouraging an estimated 60,000 @entity9 children who , federal law enforcement agents say , will cross the southern border into the @entity3 this year			1
" i think this humanitarian crisis can be laid directly at the feet of the president and his policy in 2012 , " said rep. @entity93 , a @entity94 @entity85			1
she was referring to a program backed by the @entity101 administration that defers deportation for children brought to the @entity3 previously by their parents or guardians illegally			1
though most of the children pouring across the border now would not qualify for " amnesty " under the policy , immigration law and policy experts say there is strong evidence to suggest the administration 's position motivated others to make the difficult journey to the @entity3 in the hopes that they will be granted a similar reprieve			1
" what is critical here is that we correct the record , we straighten the misperceptions , " @entity39 told the committee			0
" the smuggling operations are creating a misinformation campaign that there is a ' permisos ' , or free pass			0
" influx of immigrant children expected to last through summer president @entity101 and fellow @entity133 blame @entity134 , for refusing to take up a @entity136 - passed comprehensive immigration reform package last year and for continued fighting over incremental proposals			1
they also stress that the surge of children on the nation 's southern border is a multi-faceted problem			1
" those out there who are looking for simple answers to lay the blame on president @entity101 's policy on deferred action for childhood arrivals , or even the @entity136 passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation , i would note that neither would apply to these kids , " said rep. @entity145 , the panel 's top @entity146			1
" hence the assertion that the recent surge in unaccompanied children is due to lax immigration enforcement does not pass the smell test			1
" an analysis by the @entity164 , found that the " deep root causes for this child migration , and for the recent surge in arrivals " are complex			2
" in reality , there is no single cause			0
instead , a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge , " the report found			0
" recent @entity3 policies toward unaccompanied children , faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in @entity9 countries , the desire for family reunification , and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged			2
" a multi-faceted problem in the meantime , the administration is trying to stem the problem on several fronts by employing a multi-agency approach and drawing on @entity72 , @entity193 and @entity194 , among others			1
should @entity101 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? @entity101 has spoken with @entity201 president @entity200 about that nation 's role in helping to quell the problem			1
vice president @entity205 also has traveled to @entity33 to discuss strategies for stemming the problem with @entity9 leaders			2
@entity39 , who will travel to @entity33 later this summer , also made a public service announcement in @entity210 and @entity211 last week aimed at @entity9 parents			0
he stressed that sending their children to smugglers who then sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal			2
the administration is aggressively working to break up smuggling rings which , @entity39 said have a financial incentive to spread misinformation about amnesty for children immigrating to the country illegally			1
he told the congressional panel that he is also weighing sending more border patrol agents to the frontlines of the problem			0
@entity86 to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border the administration unveiled a plan to spend roughly $ 100 million in aid to @entity33 , @entity233 and @entity234 to help the children reintegrate and remain in their home countries once they are sent back by the @entity3 , according to a @entity86 statement			1
the administration also announced it will set aside $ 161.5 million this year for programs aimed at helping countries in that region better " respond to the region 's most pressing security and governance challenges			0
" @entity85 want the administration to do more			1
" instead of increasing funding we need to stop @entity3 aid in the centrals , " @entity93 said			0
" i would say no more money from @entity9 until they step up to their own responsibilities and stop their citizens from migrating to the @entity3			0
... we need to whack our neighbors to make sure they understand they 're not going to be taking our money			0
we are not the atm machine			0
