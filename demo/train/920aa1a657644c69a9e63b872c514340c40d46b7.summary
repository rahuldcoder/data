-- if you 're looking to unload your current @entity2 or other smartphone , now 's the time			1
beating the potentially millions of folks who will be buying a new @entity2 and selling their old one could put more money in your pocket			0
with @entity8 virtually certain to announce a release date for the next - generation @entity2 next week , lots of current @entity2 owners ( always an excitable bunch ) are no doubt counting down the minutes -- and wondering what to do with their current phones			1
while some retailers offer discounts for a trade - in ( @entity21 was offering $ 100 for some previous models when the @entity2 was released ) , @entity8 stores and their designated carriers generally do n't give back as much cash , or credit , as an owner might earn outside the store			1
but a growing online resell market has emerged to give folks another option			1
between now and monday , the day before @entity8 has scheduled an @entity2 - related event , one of those sites , @entity35 , is offering $ 250 for @entity37 and @entity36 that are in good shape			1
the company , which also has trade - in programs at some retail stores , bills itself as a way to get value out of your aging electronics while keeping the products out of landfills , where they can cause environmental problems			0
the services wipe all data from your phone as soon as they get it , they say			0
@entity35 , and others like them , refurbish used electronics and resell them			2
in the case of items like the @entity2 , they sell them in countries where the items are typically unavailable , presumably bringing a healthier price			2
@entity63 is offering $ 250 for a @entity64 iphone 4 in " flawless " condition and $ 169 for one in good condition			1
got a busted model ? it 'll give you $ 85 for one even if it wo n't turn on or is physically damaged			0
of course , there are always the direct - sale sites like @entity74 and @entity75			1
you might earn more in exchange for the hassle of posting , selling and delivering the phone yourself			0
folks were selling @entity36 on @entity74 on friday for prices ranging from $ 245 to $ 634			2
in @entity83 , people had listed @entity85 iphone 4s for prices ranging from $ 290 to $ 450			0
( we 're using prices on that model because it 's the top of the line			0
older phones , like the @entity92 , and @entity37 and @entity94 models obviously have a market as well , generally at lower prices )			0
of course , the low - effort way to deal with a phone upgrade is to buy the new one at full price and just hold on to your current model			2
even retired , your current phone can be a music player or internet - surfing device when you have a @entity108 connection .			1

as @entity110 nears , resell market for current models emerges
sites like @entity63 , @entity35 offer up to $ 250 for used @entity2 4s
there 's always @entity74 , @entity75 , etc. -- price might be better , but it takes more work
worst case , you can always make your current phone an @entity124 and @entity108 web device
