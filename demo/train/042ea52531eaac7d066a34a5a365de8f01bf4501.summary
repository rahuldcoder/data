-- a polo handicap , it has been said , is a passport to the world -- and this has certainly proved true in my case			1
i first took up polo eight years ago on a trip to @entity10			1
it has long been my philosophy that no hour of life is wasted that is spent in the saddle , and i have dabbled in equestrian sports ranging from eventing to flat racing			2
but few sports can match the all - consuming thrill of galloping up and down a 300 by 160 yard field waving a big stick			2
from my very first chukka i was , as the pun goes , ' hooked '			2
@entity10 has been polo 's spiritual home since @entity25 and @entity26 engineers introduced the sport in the late 19th century			1
there , it found fertile soil among the gauchos ( @entity10 cowboys ) and their brave , nimble horses			1
today , several estancia ( private estates ) throughout @entity10 offer fully - immersive polo holidays , to which new entrants to the sport flock like pilgrims to the holy land			1
there , beginners can learn how to ride one - handed , swing a mallet and swear in @entity45			2
the attraction of polo is easy to understand			1
from @entity49 to @entity50 , polo has been used as shorthand to suggest a glamorous , dangerous world of sleek horses and brooding players			1
traveling at speeds of up to 60 kilometers - per - hour ( 37 mph ) , teams of four aim to drive the ball through a set of vertical posts to score a goal			2
like all equestrian sports , men and women compete side - by - side , making it the only mixed sport which is also a contact sport : players can ' ride off ' opponents by using their mount to barge the other player out of the way			1
around 3,000 people in the @entity25 currently play polo , of which fewer than 10 % are professionals , according to the @entity78 , the governing body for polo in the @entity25			1
i am firmly in the amateur camp , brandishing a -1 handicap which has shown no signs of budging off its mark for several years			2
@entity87 players are rated on a scale of -2 to 10 according to their skill , where 10 is the highest rating possible			1
although expressed in ' goals ' , a player 's handicap is not an estimate of the number of goals a player might score in a given match , but rather an overall measure of his or her horsemanship , skill and strategy			1
it is so difficult to reach 10 there have never been more than a dozen or so 10 - goalers in the world at any time			1
almost all 10 - goalers , past and present , have hailed from @entity10			1
one of these highly acclaimed individuals is 28 - year - old @entity111			2
having held the ultimate ranking since the age of 19 , @entity111 is now ranked inside the top two in the world ( he disputes the number one spot with fellow @entity10 @entity117 )			1
during the @entity118 high - goal season , @entity111 plays for the all - conquering @entity119 ( which won the coveted @entity120 this weekend )			2
he gamely agreed to coach me and give me some pointers			0
the venue is @entity125 's private training facility , on a pitch so immaculate it would not look out of place at the @entity128			1
as i prepare to take to the field i ask @entity111 what he thinks is the most important quality in a player			0
unsurprisingly , he cites horsemanship : " it 's all about feeling comfortable , " he says			1
" if you do n't feel comfortable on the horse you will not be able to hit the ball			0
" so far , so good			0
@entity137 , the 8 - year - old mare @entity111 has lent me , is a dream to ride , with a canter as smooth as silk and the ability to turn on a sixpence			0
" she is one of the best ponies i have , " says @entity111			0
" anyone can play her			0
" subtext : even me ! ( @entity87 horses are still referred to as ponies , an alliterative hangover from the days when height limits applied )			1
" the next most important thing to have is a straight , fluid swing , " continues @entity111			0
he can loft the ball in excess of 100 yards while traveling at a flat - out gallop			0
my shots have a tendency to dribble weakly for 10 or so yards before coming to rest in a divot			0
@entity111 and i do have something in common , however			0
we both like to play in attack			0
" my first instinct is always to attack and not to defend , " he explains			0
polo teams are divided into four positions on the field , designated by numbers			1
players 1 and 2 are attackers , 3 is a playmaker and 4 , or back , is a defender			1
@entity111 and i both play at @entity175			0
i am always working out how to get the ball and attack all the time			2
" here the similarities end , because my strategy is usually to hang out by the goal and wait for the ball to land in front of me			0
the final piece of the puzzle is , of course , practice			0
" when you practice , you will get better and you will feel more confident with every shot. , " he explains			0
as a plucky amateur , finding time to practice is certainly my biggest challenge , even without the @entity118 weather conspiring against me			2
so how does my instructor rate my performance ? " you 're a -1 but you 're getting close to 0 , " he enthuses , almost convincingly			0
@entity111 is , of course , being far too generous			0
we both know that i wo n't be pulling on the famous black and white of @entity198 any time soon			1
but i have polished my boots just in case .			0

@entity87 is often considered a past time of the rich and famous
