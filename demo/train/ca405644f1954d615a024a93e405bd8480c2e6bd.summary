-- @entity1 is an @entity2 - winning comedian , devoted husband and loving father -- but it 's time to get to know a new side of this funnyman			1
meet @entity1 , hair expert			1
it 's a detour he took after an innocent carpool ride left @entity11 with an idea he just could n't shake			0
" i was with my daughter one day , and we 're in the car and she 's with one of her friends in the back seat , a little white friend , " he says			1
" she was just kind of raving about her friend 's hair a little too much for my comfort [ saying ] : ' you 've got great hair			2
oh , your hair 's so good			2
' " not wanting to make her comments a big deal , @entity1 says he tried to play his them off			1
" [ i said ] : " oh , baby , your hair 's beautiful			2
come on , ' " he says			0
" if i would have really reacted , then she would have a complex about her hair			2
" still , @entity1 could n't let it go			1
" it sparked something in me , " he says			0
@entity0 : @entity38 's hair throughout the years ! what rock discovered is a $ 9 billion industry that affects the daily activities , wallets , self - esteem -- and even the sex lives -- of black women			1
because women spend so much time and money on their hair , @entity1 says men are forced to adopt a hands - off policy			1
" you can not touch a black woman 's hair			1
you are conditioned not to even go there , " he says			0
" when i was a dating guy , i dated women from different races			0
anytime i was with an @entity60 or a @entity62 girl or a white girl , my hands would constantly be in their hair			1
like my hands were thirsty			0
" one of the first lessons @entity1 learned on this journey was that women do their hair for one another			1
" they say it 's for the men , but it 's really for the women			0
because guys do n't care , " he says			2
" there 's no point in the history of the world where men were not sleeping with the women in front of them			0
we take what we can get			0
" actress @entity82 , who @entity1 interviews in the film , agrees			1
" there 's always this sort of pressure within the black community like , if you have good hair , you 're prettier or better than the brown - skinned girl that wears the @entity94 or the dreads or the natural hairstyle , " she says			1
@entity0 : @entity38 's stylist reveals his hair secrets @entity1 found the biggest moneymaker in the hair business to be weaves			1
black women can spend six to eight hours getting their hair braided into tiny sections			1
stylists then delicately attach tracks of hair -- which can be simple extensions or full wigs -- to the braids			2
" if you 've got a weave , your scalp 's like a beat up highway , " @entity1 jokes			2
women who wear weaves stop by the salon for regular washes , conditioning and tightening , but the real expense lies with the hair itself			2
@entity1 says he was shocked to learn that regular women spend thousands of dollars on weaves -- and even put them on layaway			1
" @entity129 spends $ 5,000 to go to the @entity130 on her hair			1
i did n't know @entity132 was spending $ 5,000 to go to @entity133 and answer the phone , " he says			1
" @entity1 discovered the hottest hair on the market is found in @entity138 , where human hair is the number two export behind software			1
" this is some of the worst poverty in the world , " he says			0
" i do n't think [ people ] know they 're walking around with $ 1,000 on their head			2
" while in @entity138 , @entity11 witnessed a tonsuring ceremony at the @entity148			0
every year , more than 10 million people cut their hair off as an offering to the @entity153 gods			1
" in @entity138 , hair is considered a vanity , and removing hair is considered an act of self - sacrifice , " he says			0
" these people have no idea where their hair is going or how much it 's worth			0
the money made at this temple is second only to the @entity165			0
the hair collected here is auctioned off to exporters who distribute it around the planet			0
" another staple of the industry is relaxers -- also called " creamy crack " by some			2
while women of other races use perms to add curl , black women use them to straighten their hair			2
" you name a black woman , any black woman , " @entity1 says			1
" they 've either had their hair relaxed , or they 're having their hair relaxed right now			0
" the active ingredient in relaxer is a substance called sodium hydroxide			0
the chemical is so strong it can burn a woman 's hair off -- which is why @entity1 is urging parents to stop the relaxing addiction now			1
" this kiddie perm has to stop , okay ? they should n't have to worry about that till they 're in their teens , " he says			0
" putting those chemicals in that child 's hair is just not cool			2
" @entity1 says he tells his own daughters they 're beautiful every moment he can -- and has only one answer when it comes to questions of having good hair			1
" whatever makes you happy is good hair , " he says			0
" do your hair for you , and you will be happy			0
