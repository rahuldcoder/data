in a match played against a backdrop of escalating tensions between @entity14 and @entity15 , the home team @entity10 triumphed 5 - 1 in the opening round of the @entity18 tournament			1
with @entity14 having announced the expulsion of @entity15 's ambassador last week and the suspension of military agreements following a naval incident in may , there were fears the match might not go ahead			2

last season 's losing finalists @entity67 beat @entity58 debutants @entity71 3 - 1 away in @entity72 , while @entity74 's @entity73 won 2 - 0 at home to @entity77 's @entity76			2
@entity78 , who won the 2009 - 10 title , cruised to a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity84 side @entity83 -- playing after @entity86 club @entity85 lost an appeal after fielding ineligible players			0
