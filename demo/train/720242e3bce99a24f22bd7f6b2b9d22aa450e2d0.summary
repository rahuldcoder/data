-- as the run - up to the 2012 @entity1 elections gains momentum , @entity2 @entity1 may prove to be an especially influential political force			1
according to a new report , the political mobilization of @entity1 hispanics is an increasingly mobile ( as in cell phones ) phenomenon			1
according to @entity8 and @entity12 , published recently by the @entity13 , " the use of cell phones builds upon the cultural affinity for close connections and opens the way for organized political and social action			1
three areas in particular demonstrate the power of mobile technology in the @entity2 community : immigration , education and voter registration / mobilization			1
" the report points out that @entity8 have been leading the @entity1 population in terms of embracing mobile technology			1
for example , last summer @entity31 found that more than 87 percent of @entity33 - speaking @entity1 @entity8 owned a cell phone , vs. 80 percent of non-hispanic whites			1
another @entity31 study found that , compared to the general @entity1 population , @entity8 use their cell phones more often , and they use more features on their phones			1
additionally , @entity31 found in 2009 that @entity8 were leading other ethnic groups in mobile internet access			2
@entity2 mobile civic engagement is n't just limited to smartphones , which so far comprise less than one third of the cell phones in use in the @entity1			1
much of this activity is happening via text messaging , e-mail , the mobile web and social media -- tools available on most " feature phones " ( the next step down from smartphones , and usually the most affordable type of cell phone )			0
for example , the report notes that in 2006 " a group of 4,000 @entity2 high school students used @entity63 , e-mails , and texting to organize a walkout in protest			2
the students ' success served as an inspiration for a subsequent major demonstration in april 2006 in @entity71 with 350,000 participants			0
" and in 2009 , two immigration advocacy groups ( @entity73 and the @entity75 coalition ) , ran a successful text messaging campaign			0
they sent out simple alerts containing key information , calls to action , and quick responses to breaking news			0
they gathered feedback via text messaging			0
organizers credit this with increased attendance at rallies and hearings in 2009 compared to previous rallies in 2008			0
cell phones also played a leading role in mobilizing the 10,000 @entity94 voters that the @entity13 signed up during its 2009 voter registration drive : " once individuals were registered to vote , they were sent numerous text messages to remind them about early voting , voting site locations , availability of transportation to the voting sites , updates about ballot initiatives , and other information			2
additionally , voters were given contact information and a central location for in - person contacts			0
this two - way mobile network allowed voters to access information when it was most convenient to them			0
" furthermore , " @entity115 staff were able use text messaging to gauge how many of the newly registered voters had taken part in early voting or were likely to wait until nov. 2			0
with this real - time data , @entity115 staff were able to then target particular neighborhoods , and even specific addresses , for additional in - person follow up			0
" @entity115 believes that mobile apps increasingly will drive @entity2 civic engagement			1
a 2010 @entity31 report indicates that @entity1 hispanic smartphone owners are avidly embracing apps , for everything from video sharing to banking and more			1
and in general , apps are becoming a key tool for all kinds of political and advocacy campaigns -- from candidate - driven to grassroots			0
apps may indeed fuel future @entity2 civic engagement			1
but if the goal is to reach a large and economically diverse group such as @entity8 , smartphone apps are just one part of an integrated mobile strategy			2
other vital components of effective engagement efforts include simpler @entity144 - based apps ( designed to run on feature phones via platforms such as @entity147 and @entity148 ) , mobile web sites , social media , e-mail , and text messaging			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity155 .			0
