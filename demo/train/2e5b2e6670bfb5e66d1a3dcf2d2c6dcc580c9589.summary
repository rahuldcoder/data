i suppose we should have seen it coming , really			2
back in the fall , when @entity6 was buzzing about another candidacy , the storyline was this : it 's in the realm of the " truly hypothetical , " i was told , with a strong suggestion that @entity11 would only run as part of a late - entrant party - savior scenario			1
" a lot of people ... are rooting for him to get in , " said one inside source			0
" @entity11 's not one of them			1
" well , i guess he is now			0
what a difference a few months makes			2
now , multiple sources inside the @entity11 bubble tell me ( and everyone else ) that they " bet " that he gets in the race			1
and we will know something within " the next few weeks			0
" he had a great midterm election , they point out			0
( as in : he campaigned like crazy for candidates who won in red states that @entity11 had won			1
) he believes that he was right on foreign policy positions that he was " mocked " for during the 2012 campaign			0
( as in : @entity37 is our " no.1 geopolitical foe			0
" ) oh , and by the way , he still thinks he can manage the economy better than anyone out there			0
but , almost to a person , those close to @entity11 also say this : do n't get too analytical about this new decision			1
one source close to @entity11 , who has spoken with him about this calculation , puts it this way : " this is about the burning ambition of a guy who believes he would be a great president			1
he believes he is the right guy for the job			0
" which brings us to the rationale for the rest of the ever - expanding field , which is also not complicated : why not run ? it 's not very often that you have the conjunction of two key situations -- an open @entity63 and a party without an obvious frontrunner			1
the @entity67 establishment has not coalesced around @entity69 gov. @entity68 , as some thought might happen			1
@entity71 , another somewhat unexpected contender , has never run in a presidential primary			2
the tea party has a gaggle of candidates to choose from , and has n't settled , either			0
so , from a cost - benefit standpoint , there 's no downside for those entering the presidential sweepstakes for the first time			1
let 's say you know you probably wo n't win , but -- looking back at the last campaign -- you 'll probably get your 15 minutes of fame			2
( can you say @entity87 ? ) it 's a good way to elevate yourself if you bring anything at all to the table			2
and even if you do n't , it 's still a good platform from which you can increase your speech fees , board availabilities and tv appearances			2
so get behind that podium , asap			0
@entity11 , of course , is in a different category : he has more to lose			1
he 's a man who lost in 2012 with grace and carried on in the same manner			2
he was indefatigable during the midterms			0
here 's the rub : once you have been a party 's nominee , and you vie again , you need to do well			2
looking back into semi-recent history , @entity105 stands out as a winner on that level , nominated in 1960 , nominated again by @entity67 and winning in 1968			1
@entity110 nominee @entity109 , the other hand , not so much			0
he ran against @entity112 and lost in 1952 and lost again in 1956			0
generally , one - time presidential nominees who lose tend to decide they 're not up for the thrill of it all again			2
and while @entity11 allies swear this decision is n't about the qualifications of the rest of the field , he clearly has n't looked around and found a candidate he thinks is as good as he is			1
" he 's not motivated by some sense of entitled ambition , " says a @entity11 ally			1
" it 's just that @entity11 looks at the field and believes he has a lot to offer			1
and we think experience is an advantage			0
" translation : these other guys have no idea what they 're in for , and i do			0
a favorite analogy of @entity11 supporters is the @entity138			1
" it makes a big difference to have been there before , " says one adviser			0
another finds the analogy helpful when referring to @entity71 's now - famous declaration ( and @entity11 jab ) that the @entity67 nominee needs to be willing to " lose the primary to win the general " to keep principles intact			1
" the process is the process , " this @entity11 supporter says			1
" you ca n't show up at the @entity138 and say ' i wish it was an 80 - yard field			2
' " in other words , @entity71 , you have to win the primaries in order to win the nomination			0
underlying all of this are two @entity11 presumptions			1
first , that he would be a better candidate			0
and next , that he would run a better campaign			0
that remains to be seen			0
but here 's what is already obvious : @entity67 see @entity165 as probably inevitable as the @entity110 nominee and completely gettable as their opponent			1
they believe the @entity110 ca n't duplicate the @entity169 coalition without @entity169			0
they understand the gender gap will grow , but they figure @entity174 's liabilities will grow , too -- as a candidate and as a former secretary of state			2
" @entity11 was a poor candidate up against a machine and he got 47 % of the vote , " says a @entity110 strategist			1
" i do n't blame them for thinking they can win			0
" @entity11 could not have said it better himself .			1

@entity184 : @entity11 seemed *uninterested* months *ago* , but now he 's looking at it seriously
he likes his chances in the very *crowded* @entity67 presidential field
