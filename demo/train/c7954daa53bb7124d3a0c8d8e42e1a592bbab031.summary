-- less than a year after four strangers risked their lives to save @entity4 and her sons from an icy @entity6 , the mother is accused of slashing the two boys ' throats and leaving them to die			1
@entity4 was arrested november 15 after leaving the hospital where she had been since the attack			1
@entity4 's 2 - year - old son was found dead the morning of october 27 outside the family 's van , which was parked a short distance from the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity6			1
her 7 - year - old son was injured but still alive inside the van			1
he was rushed to the hospital for surgery , according to the @entity6 @entity21			2
scars on his neck underscore the chilling account he gave police , contained in a police affidavit filed in @entity29 court			0
the boy said his mother started with him , taking him from the van before covering his eyes , ears and mouth with duct tape , according to the affidavit			1
then , he told police , she cut his throat			2
she then moved on to his younger brother , he said			0
he could hear his brother 's cries as she repeated the attack on him , the 7 - year - old told police			1
@entity4 initially denied involvement in the attacks , blaming them on a stranger			1
eventually , she admitted to acquiring the knife and duct tape weeks earlier but could not explain why , the affidavit says			1
@entity4 faces life in prison on charges of first - degree murder , attempted murder and child endangerment resulting in serious injury			1
she is being held on $ 2.5 million bail , county attorney @entity61 said			0
she has not entered a plea but is scheduled for arraignment december 2			1
repeated calls to @entity65 , @entity4 's public defender , were not returned			1
@entity0 was unable to find any public comments by @entity65 on the case			0
the attacks have rattled the community of @entity70 , a suburb of @entity71 where @entity4 and her husband , @entity73 , lived with their sons			1
the arrest comes just three months after @entity6 gov. @entity77 honored four men for diving into the @entity6 to rescue @entity4 and her sons on a cold december afternoon last year			1
the governor 's office gave the following account : @entity4 was driving the boys to the library when the car hit the curb , skidded on ice and then plunged into the river			1
as rushing waters filled the car , three passers - by who had watched it veer off the road plunged after it into the icy waters			2
inside the car , @entity4 dislodged her older son from his booster seat and passed him through the window to @entity101 , who brought the boy ashore			1
@entity4 removed her younger son , then 14 months old , from his car seat and handed him out the window to @entity106			1
@entity106 began to swim with the boy and then passed the boy to @entity107 , according to the governor 's office			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , had escaped from the car and was fighting the rough currents pulling her underwater			1
bicyclist @entity112 noticed her struggling and dropped his bicycle to dive in after her			0
the dramatic rescue formed a bond between the @entity117 and their four saviors , especially @entity101 , who befriended the family			0
he did not respond to @entity0 's phone calls but spoke recently with a local television station			0
" your heart sinks to hear that something was happening again , " @entity101 told @entity123 , a television station in @entity124 , @entity6			2
" i mean , we just rescued these kids and mom from the river last december			2
" @entity101 told @entity123 he was grateful that the older boy had survived but worried about the rough times ahead for him			2
" dying at the age of seven would have been really , really tragic , " he told @entity123			2
" i 'm also saddened that there are certainly difficulties he will have in the days and years to come that are troubling to think about			0
" police have said they are not re-examining last year 's accident in light of the recent attacks on the boys			1
prosecutor @entity61 would not comment on whether they were related			0
the 2 - year - old 's slaying also marks the first homicide in five years in @entity29 , the prosecutor said			1
" murder cases are pretty few and far in between here			0
we 're a small rural community of 21,000 people , " @entity61 said			0
" any time you have a case with these kinds of facts , it 's going to draw some kind of attention			0
but i was not prepared for this degree of attention			0
" for many , the grisly nature of the attacks is compounded by the fact the boys ' own mother is charged with plotting and carrying them out			2
cases of mothers who kill their children , like @entity170 and @entity171 , continue to fascinate the public , even as the rates of filicide -- the act of a parent who kills his or her own child -- have remained fairly stable			2
" because these cases are so tragic , they pull at your heartstrings , but they happen all the time , " said @entity179 , a professor at @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity182			0
in 2005 , 555 children under the age of five were victims of homicide , compared with 544 in 1976			2
the rate peaked in 1991 at 778 and bottomed out in 1971 at 511 , according to statistics from the @entity192			0
another fairly stable statistic : in more than 50 percent of child homicides , the killer is a parent			0
" the natural defense to anticipate is insanity , because why would a mother kill her own child ? " @entity179 asked			0
" it certainly can be insanity , but it 's not always the case			0
perfectly sane people can do horrible things , and they do , every day			0
" mothers can be motivated to kill their children by several factors , according to criminologist @entity208 , @entity209 professor of criminal justice at @entity211			2
some act on genuine psychotic delusions , as jurors determined to be the case with @entity216 mother @entity171 , who told doctors she drowned her five children because @entity220 told her to do so			1
others can be motivated by selfish reasons : @entity170 's alleged motive for killing her children was that she perceived them to be an obstacle in her relationship with her boyfriend			2
" it 's a crazy thing to do , but crazy describes the behavior , not the mind , " @entity208 said , adding that between 300 and 350 children have been homicide victims in 2008			1
" it does n't make sense to most of us , but that does n't mean the state of mind of the person is mentally ill. you may know what you 're doing and have very selfish motivations , " he explained			0
@entity4 said she could n't explain why she did what she did , according to the affidavit			1
police said she initially told a false but chilling tale of how a normal , two - hour sunday drive to visit relatives was interrupted by a brutal attack on her family			1
on that monday morning in october , she showed up on the doorstep of a home in @entity16 , claiming that a man she could n't identify had abducted her and her children			2
the person who answered the door called 911 , and sheriff 's deputies located the van with @entity4 's help			1
initially , she denied involvement in the attacks and stood by the statement that she 'd been attacked by a stranger			1
when pressed by investigators , however , @entity4 said she had purchased a knife a month earlier and duct tape two months earlier , the affidavit states			1
the document also says that before she and her sons left home sunday , she wrote a note detailing the abduction by a stranger			2
the note was found in the van , according to the affidavit			0
the document went on to say : " she stated that it all happened within five minutes and prior to 1:30 pm			0
she stated she could n't explain why she had done it			0
she stated that she could n't face anyone			0
she stated that she wanted to die or be locked up where she could n't hurt anyone			0
" after speaking with investigators , @entity4 was taken to the hospital to be treated for her own wounds and trauma , said prosecutor @entity61 , declining to elaborate			1
she remained there until she was arrested and taken to jail a week ago saturday			0
a plea of not guilty would open the door to a criminal trial , where @entity4 's state of mind would become a key issue , experts say			1
@entity294 , a forensic psychiatrist and chairman of @entity296 , interviewed @entity171 and testified for the prosecution at her trial			0
he said the successful insanity defense in @entity301 ' case made what was once an " unthinkable " strategy into a viable defense .			0

@entity4 allegedly first told investigators a stranger attacked her and boys
authorities say she admitted buying duct tape , knife weeks earlier
2 - year - old is one of about 300 children slain this year
@entity4 is scheduled to be arraigned on december 2
