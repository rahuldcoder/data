-- i was 5 years old when the person who took my innocence touched me inappropriately			1
what he did to me went on for a period of time , though i do n't remember how long exactly			1
he was a teenage babysitter			2
his sister also participated in the abuse			2
she taught me things that no child should know about sex			1
to this day i do n't understand why they did what they did			2
i 'm not sure i care why they did it			2
what matters to me now is talking about it			1
as a victim , i want to start a conversation about sexual abuse			2
as a society , i 'm well aware that many people -- victims like me -- are afraid to speak out because they feel ashamed or scared			1
but by remaining silent , victims like me feel like we 're taking responsibility for a crime committed against us that we know is wrong			1
i wanted nothing to do with the abuse			2
i did n't want it to be a part of me , so i ignored it for almost 25 years			2
during that time , the memories haunted me and i developed unhealthy coping mechanisms to compensate for the negative way i saw myself			2
i tried to be outwardly perfect			2
i withdrew and became defensive when i faced criticism			2
but in order to heal , victims need to be able to talk about what happened to them , to acknowledge the horror of it , to condemn it and to demand punishment			1
for example , if we pretend that armed robberies do n't happen because they are bad , we would probably have @entity47 and @entity48 running around everywhere			2
by talking about sexual abuse , we send a message to society to pay more attention to this problem			1
it 's not easy for me to disclose this part of my life			1
but with the love of my family and friends , i have begun to address the problem			2
part of that includes seeking the help of a therapist to understand the impact of the abuse			0
and then something happened the other day			1
when @entity71 received a lifetime achievement award and got a standing ovation at the @entity74 on sunday night , his ex-wife @entity68 and her son @entity70 sent out tweets that alluded to alleged sexual abuse of @entity68 's adopted daughter @entity78 , who was 7 when @entity71 and @entity70 were married			1
@entity71 denied the allegation and was never charged , but @entity68 and @entity70 believe otherwise			0
their tweets made me think of my own past			0
i remember reading an article a few months ago about the allegation			0
when i read about @entity78 and the @entity85 trying to put forward her voice and her story , i wondered what was holding me back in telling my story			0
now , i 'm revealing to the public something so personal i 'm not sure what 's going to happen as a result			1
i am not sure how people will treat me			0
i do n't know if people will think i am damaged			0
i 've been told i am brave for talking about it			1
but i wish i never had to be brave			0
i wish it had never happened			1
it 's a punishment to me every day knowing that the people who abused me -- who impacted my life in such a harmful way -- escaped justice			1
as much as i want to bring my case to justice , it is difficult to do so because it happened more than two decades ago in a foreign country			1
at the time , i did n't understand what was happening to me			0
i was 5 , and i was n't going to take anyone to court			0
i am not entirely sure that going public with my story is a good idea			0
i do know that the alternative - denial and silence - is no way to live			0
i felt ashamed of something i did n't do			1
but as i have begun to talk about the abuse , i have discovered that i have no reason to feel ashamed			1
there are many adults who may feel ashamed about sexual abuse in their own life			1
they may be confused about what to do			0
they may think -- " what if i am wrong and i accuse this person and create a mess " -- and they balk at action			0
they should take action -- when they are ready			0
whether that means taking their perpetrator to court , speaking out about how to help victims , discussing with their communities about ways of prevention , or advocating for more resources to help those who are being sexually abused or were sexually abused			1
the therapy i have been lucky enough to have access to has changed my life			0
an important part of overcoming sexual abuse is addressing the stigma of seeking the help of a therapist , because some people may think you 're crazy or unstable			0
therapy has helped me begin to heal that wound			1
according to @entity158 , one in five girls and one in twenty boys are victims of sexual abuse			1
such abuse causes children to " develop low self - esteem , a feeling of worthlessness and an abnormal or distorted view of sex			0
" and when they grow up , they can become withdrawn and suicidal			0
as a journalist , every day when i show up for work , i ask other people to tell their stories from staring down the @entity174 shooter to surviving the @entity175 , @entity177 tornado			0
i ask these people to be fearless in telling the world about their stories			0
but when it came to my own story , i have n't done it ... until now			0
i believe in telling the truth -- and i believe telling the truth can set you free , however trite that is			0
if you can find your words , you should use them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

@entity193 : i was sexually abused when i was a child ; it 's not easy to reveal this
@entity198 : to heal , victims need to be able to talk about what happened to them
she says many victims are afraid to speak out because they feel ashamed or scared
