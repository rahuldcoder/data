@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has never been to @entity4			1
he has no friends and family there			1
nor does he have any military experience or background in weapons analysis			1
but when he lost his job last year , he used the extra hours to indulge an interest in current events , particularly the @entity14			2
sitting in his living room in @entity0 , @entity1 , he started a blog under the handle @entity18 , after a @entity20 song			2
" i literally thought : no one is going to read this			2
but i 'm doing it for my own entertainment			0
" in fact , by sifting through hundreds of battle videos posted online , @entity3 has shown the @entity4 army 's use of cluster bombs -- now documented by @entity30 -- although @entity4 has denied using cluster bombs			1
he 's also showed a trail of @entity34 weapons supplied to @entity4 's rebels by @entity36 with the consent of @entity39 allies -- an investigative expose published in the @entity40			1
" it 's really about finding the patterns of what 's going on , " @entity3 says			1
" with the cluster bombs the @entity4 government still seems to have the official policy of refusing to state that they are using them			1
and i 've collected a vast amount of evidence of cluster bombs in @entity4			1
there is video of cluster bombs dispersing from helicopters			1
that 's something that ca n't really be faked			0
" he tracks the weapons of the war in @entity4 on his laptop from a cream - colored sofa in his living room			1
" when the @entity4 air force started using helicopters , i was looking at that , " he recalls			1
" then i saw my first partly exploded bomb and identified that			0
that was really the start of weapons identification			2
" @entity3 describes a daily routine that 's part mr. @entity72 , part intelligence analyst			1
" i have to take care of my 18 - month - old daughter during the day			0
so , i 'm sort of checking my e-mails off and on , just keeping an eye on @entity78			0
and when my daughter 's in bed , i 'll sort of sit down and look at videos			2
i 've got a list of about 450 activist channels on @entity84			0
" @entity85 shows @entity2 one video of a @entity4 rebel fighter with a grenade launcher tucked into his shoulder			1
he freeze - frames and points to two tiny bolts that he says prove this is a @entity34 weapon , not a @entity95 version			0
" it shows a @entity34 rpg - 6 grenade launcher			0
and one of the things i was looking for was the specific type			0
because they 're an exact copy of another grenade launcher that 's virtually identical			0
" it 's this unerring eye for detail that has made him a bona fide member of an online community of experts that 's monitoring the war and has put him in high demand with @entity4 watchers			1
he now contributes to @entity114 and helps to compile a cluster bomb database for @entity30			1
" i think i 'm sort of a hybrid between an analyst , a researcher and an archivist , " @entity3 says			1
" one thing , i do n't consider myself a journalist			0
i find things that i want journalists to make use of themselves			0
" but as far removed from the war as @entity3 is , the images of war can still be disturbing			2
he never watches these videos with his daughter in the room and he tends to play them with the sound turned down			2
he shows @entity2 video of a 4 - year old being handed an @entity135 , his tiny finger on the trigger			0
" some of the videos are disturbing just because of content			2
it sort of amazes me the sort of footage you see			0
some of it is incredible			0
" he shows another video where his talent for weapons spotting reveals a terrifying image			2
" this is a group of children and that 's a 240mm mortar that 's not exploded and that 's the largest kind of mortar in use today			0
look , they 're kicking at it			0
