-- the @entity2 boys are a true band of brothers			0
all seven served in the military , yet they fought on opposing sides			1
" we were seven brothers -- seven soldiers , " says 91 - year old @entity6 , a @entity7 veteran now living in a retirement home in @entity9			1
" five of us for the @entity12 and two against us because they were stranded in @entity14 " when the war came			1
they 're all @entity12 citizens born here in the @entity12			1
in the 1920s , @entity6 's parents operated a migrant labor hotel in @entity21 , a farm town in central @entity22			1
but their dreams of riches never materialized , and the entire family returned to @entity14			1
in 1937 , three of the older brothers -- @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- returned to the @entity12 in search of a better life			1
they worked in the wholesale produce business , and @entity29 enrolled at @entity34 in @entity9 , hoping to be a fine artist			0
then on december 7 , 1941 the @entity14 bombed @entity36 and the brothers ' dreams were put on hold			1
they received draft notices , and while many of their fellow @entity43 -- second - generation @entity14 - @entity12 -- were being booted out of the @entity44 , classified as enemy aliens , the brothers found their niches			1
" all of us served -- three of us at first for @entity48 ( the @entity44 's @entity48 , as @entity14 language specialists ) , and two younger ones ( @entity50 and @entity51 ) for the @entity14 navy and army			1
the youngest ones were stuck in @entity14 but too young to serve			1
after the war , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and @entity57 ( @entity58 ) came back as @entity12 citizens , and when the @entity61 started , they volunteered also with the @entity48			1
" " @entity6 's memories of war are still vivid			1
clutching a crumbling photo album , he peels back pages filled with fading photographs and hand - drawn cartoons of his @entity44 life			1
the stories spill out like the loose pages in his album			0
perhaps @entity6 's most vivid memory is also his most poignant			1
on christmas eve , 1944 , he remembers running for cover while his younger brother @entity51 -- a pilot -- dive - bombed an @entity12 camp on @entity76 in the @entity77			1
" i remember the attack " , @entity6 says , " because i was on @entity76 , and here comes a plane			1
i look up in the sky , it was at night , and i saw those planes in a searchlight and they were shooting			0
i could hear the bullets coming down , and we rushed out			0
" as @entity88 returned to his base in @entity14 , he was shot down			2
the wreckage and his body were found on an island near @entity93 " i knew he must have been serving because he was at the age , but i did n't know until it was all over and i came back and found out he died " @entity94 says			0
" i was just hit so hard that i did n't feel right			0
" @entity6 picks up two photos from his tattered album			2
in one photo , @entity51 is seated , wearing his @entity14 @entity102 uniform and gripping a samurai sword			2
the other is a photo of @entity51 's grave marker in the family 's village , @entity109 near @entity110			0
" what a waste , " @entity6 says			2
" i wish he [ @entity51 ] were alive			0
" by 1945 , @entity14 was losing its grip in the @entity114			2
@entity51 's younger brother , @entity50 , was conscripted into the @entity14 army			2
he was on a troop ship sailing with hundreds of recruits toward @entity119 as reinforcements			0
the ship was attacked and sunk by @entity12 planes			2
@entity123 was wounded and died several years later			0
@entity124 , the oldest brother , was to ship out with the celebrated 442nd @entity125 to @entity126			0
two days before , he heard the question , " who speaks @entity14 ? " he answered simply , " i do ! " and was also transferred into the @entity48			2
@entity124 served in the @entity129 and became known as the " voice of @entity12 propaganda			1
" using shortwave radio , he broadcast @entity14 music and read news and commentaries whose goal was to demoralize @entity14 soldiers throughout the @entity138 and urge the citizens of @entity14 to surrender			2
on july 27 , 1945 , a day after it was released , he broadcast the @entity141 -- the terms of @entity14 's @entity7 surrender			1
" i do n't know how the reception was , but i was really happy the war was over " he says			0
@entity28 , the second - oldest brother and last of them drafted , saw occupation duty in two of @entity14 's major cities , @entity148 and @entity150			2
for @entity94 , the third - oldest brother , service was n't always so metropolitan			0
on @entity76 , he said , " i saw bodies everywhere " after a nine - day @entity154 battle there in 1944			0
eight thousand @entity155 were killed			0
by comparison , the 2nd and 4th @entity154 divisions lost 328 men			0
hundreds of @entity14 troops held out in the jungles for months			2
around the camp 's perimeter , he saw starving @entity14 soldiers scavenging for food			2
he 'd yell , in @entity14 : " @entity7 is over around here ! many @entity155 have surrendered and are in camps under our care			1
please come out and surrender ! " " maybe my @entity14 was bad ... they did n't come out , " @entity6 says			1
the following summer , the b - 29 bomber @entity170 flew from @entity76 airfield to drop the first atomic bomb on @entity110			0
as part of his duties on @entity76 , @entity6 was asked to start a school for hundreds of @entity14 and @entity177 children			1
with the war in the @entity114 over , @entity6 helped @entity154 in occupied @entity14			1
they scoured the countryside for the wreckage of downed @entity12 bombers and their missing servicemen			2
@entity6 was with the first @entity154 unit to meet @entity14 civilians in the @entity189 region on the @entity14 island of @entity191			1
" i was a little frightened , " he says of his initial contact with the @entity14 civilians -- worried about perceptions that he , a @entity14 - @entity12 , was consorting with the enemy			1
to his relief , he discovered that his shared heritage and translation skills , coupled with a respectful @entity154 presence , calmed everyone 's fears			0
the war in the @entity114 ripped apart nations and families , and it divided loyalties			0
but @entity94 is pleased with all of his brothers ' achievements			0
" i 'm kind of proud , " he says of their military service			0
" but at the same time , i really hate war from the beginning			0
" he adds : " those brothers of mine did n't hate me			0
i did n't hate them			0
we were just called to do the job , and we did it			0

all seven @entity6 brothers served in the military : some for the @entity12 and some for @entity14
@entity222 were in the @entity44 during @entity7
two who were left behind in @entity14 fought against the @entity12 during the war
two others stuck in @entity14 were too young to fight ; they served on @entity12 side during @entity61
