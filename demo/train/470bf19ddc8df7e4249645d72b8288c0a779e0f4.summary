@entity0 , @entity1 -- before it 's signed , the freshly minted security agreement between the @entity4 and @entity1 must face the scrutiny of the @entity1 people in @entity0 , starting thursday			1
thousands of tribal elders , who have made their way to the capital , have kicked off the loya jirga , a grand assembly , to confer in the coming days on a key issue : whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of @entity4 troops beyond next year , when @entity18 plans to end their combat mission			1
" they have to pass it , " said @entity4 secretary of state @entity20 , who announced wednesday that he and @entity1 president @entity21 had arrived at the agreement			1
" it 's up to the people of @entity1			1
" but is the jirga 's decision binding ? and what happens next ? what is the loya jirga ? a loya jirga is a uniquely @entity1 way of debating and resolving issues of national importance			1
for centuries leaders of the rugged , tribal - based @entity38 nation have called the assembly to choose new kings , debate political matters and factional disputes , or adopt new laws and constitutions			0
the meetings are intended to bridge divides between the country 's divergent ethnic groups and create consensus among them			1
is the loya jirga 's decision binding ? not really			1
the loya jirga is by no means fully democratic , but the opinions of its 2,000 - plus members are an important indicator of how the @entity1 people feel			1
in the past , @entity21 has said he respects the body and would acquiesce to its decision			1
the elders have come to this loya jirga at @entity21 's invitation , but that does not guarantee that they will support him in approving the security agreement			1
he has been heckled at least once at a past gathering			0
how does the assembly work ? after the opening session thursday , the jirga will break up into smaller working groups for the next three days			2
the members will discuss the agreement among themselves and then present their recommendations to the full gathering			0
if the loya jirga passes the security agreement , what 's next ? once the elders have weighed in , @entity1 's parliament will vote on the proposed bilateral agreement			1
then it will wait for signature by the president			0
that may not be @entity21			2
on thursday , he told the tribal elders that the arrangement wo n't be signed until after elections scheduled for april 2014 , and @entity21 has reached the term limit set by his country 's constitution			1
he told @entity2 's @entity92 it 's " absolutely time to go			0
" if all goes well , when does the agreement go into effect ? the agreement would go into effect january 1 , 2015 , and last " until the end of 2024 and beyond , unless terminated " by mutual agreement , according to a copy of the deal posted online wednesday by the @entity1 government			1
a @entity4 official confirms the copy is authentic			0
the agreement says that either side will have to give two years ' notice if they want to terminate it			0
what are the key takeaways in the tentative agreement ? the final language of the security agreement -- which @entity20 and @entity21 reached a deal on -- guides the role of @entity4 troops in @entity1			1
according to the tentative deal : -- @entity4 forces will play a support role in @entity1			2
-- but it also says that @entity4 military operations " may be appropriate " to defeat @entity122 and its affiliates			0
-- it says the @entity1 military will take the lead in counterterrorism operations and the @entity4 will complement that " with full respect for @entity1 sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the @entity1 people , including in their homes			1
" -- it mentions @entity4 government funding for @entity1 security forces			2
-- it gives the @entity4 military strict jurisdiction if a @entity4 soldier is alleged to commit unlawful acts on @entity1 soil			2
-- on the other hand , @entity1 authorities may request that anyone be removed from the country			2
so , what are the sticking points ? military raids and strikes have long been a sore point between the two countries , given a number of incidents in which civilian men , women and children were killed			0
the proposed deal contains references to respecting " @entity1 's sovereignty and territorial integrity " and adds that @entity4 forces " shall not target @entity1 civilians , including in their homes			1
" but the agreement does not address past transgressions			0
why not ? because @entity20 says that during his back - and - forth with @entity21 , a demand for a @entity4 apology was " not even on the table			1
" some published reports have suggested otherwise			0
" i do n't know where the idea of an apology started , " @entity20 said			0
" president @entity21 did n't ask for an apology			1
... there has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever			0
" but the @entity4 has made a promise , @entity21 told the loya jirga thursday			1
president @entity186 has vowed that @entity4 troops wo n't raid @entity1 homes barring exceptional cases involving direct threat to @entity4 citizens			1
in a letter from @entity186 to @entity21 , made public by @entity1 officials , the @entity4 president reiterates that @entity4 forces in @entity1 will " continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of @entity1 in their homes and in their daily lives , just as we do for our own citizens			1
" " as this new agreement states , @entity4 forces shall not enter @entity1 homes for the purposes of military operations , except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of @entity4 nationals , " @entity186 wrote			1
" the @entity4 commitment to @entity1 's independence , territorial integrity , and national unity , as enshrined in our @entity216 , is enduring , as is our respect for @entity1 sovereignty			2
" what 's another stumbling block ? another stumbling block is whether @entity4 soldiers accused of a crime can stand trial in an @entity1 court			2
the agreement gives the @entity4 strict military jurisdiction			0
but many @entity1 feel that that compromises the country 's sovereignty			2
is the issue of immunity a deal - breaker ? the @entity4 has said that unless @entity4 troops get immunity from @entity1 prosecution , it will pull out all its troops by the end of 2014 -- like it did from @entity241 at the end of 2011			0
that could have significant consequences for @entity1			0
it needs some troop presence for training its forces and for stability			0
can this obstacle be resolved ? @entity21 says he can convince the loya jirga to allow that			1
" i can go to the @entity1 people and tell them that , well , if we are to ask for a @entity4 presence in @entity1 for that broader security and stability , there are things that they want in return , " he told @entity92 in january			2
" and immunity is the principle thing that they want			0
so i will argue for it			0
and i can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say , all right , let 's do it			0
" what 's the takeaway : will all @entity4 troops be home by the end of 2014 ? no. president @entity186 has promised to end @entity4 combat mission by the end of 2014			0
the key word here is " combat			0
" speaking on wednesday , @entity280 spokesman @entity279 stressed that same point : " the war in @entity1 will end next year , as the president has promised			2
the combat mission will be over			0
" but the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for @entity4 troops to remain on the ground in @entity1 beyond that			2
@entity20 said the @entity4 military 's role in @entity1 would be " very limited , " adding " it is entirely ( to ) train , equip and assist " @entity1 forces			1
@entity2 's @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
