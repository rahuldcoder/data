@entity0 -- @entity3 moved one step closer to prosecuting the senior commanders behind a military coup in 1980 when a @entity3 court approved on tuesday a prosecutor 's indictment of retired army general and former president @entity11 , semi-official @entity2 reported			1
@entity13 's 12th @entity12 also announced retired air force chief @entity14 was included in the indictment			1
according to @entity2 , the indictment suggests life imprisonment for @entity11 and @entity14 for allegedly committing " acts against the forces of the state			1
" some @entity3 media have drawn parallels to the landmark prosecution of @entity24 's once unassailable military dictator @entity23			1
@entity11 , now 94 , led the overthrow of the @entity3 government when he ordered tanks out into the streets of the capital in the pre-dawn hours of september 12 , 1980			1
the overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right - and left - wing @entity3 militants , and many prominent voices in @entity3 and abroad initially welcomed the coup			1
a @entity37 cover from the time even featured a " paternalistic portrait of @entity40 clasping a collage of the @entity0 skyline in his arms with the caption ' holding @entity3 together ' , " according to " @entity3 unveiled , a @entity38			0
" but in the aftermath of the military take - over , accounts of human rights abuses began to emerge			1
hundreds of thousands of people were thrown in jail , many of them tortured			0
the military junta also disbanded political parties , jailed senior politicians , and sentenced hundreds of people to death			1
" september 12th is the mother of all coups in @entity3 's history , " said @entity58 , columnist and deputy editor of the @entity3 daily newspaper " @entity61			2
" " it damaged the whole country and probably caused incurable damage on one whole generation of the youth in this society			0
" @entity71 , co-author of " @entity3 unveiled , " said the coup " brought @entity3 politics back to the kindergarten			2
" " [ @entity75 ] somehow wanted to force the politicians to be less conflictual , but he did so by dumbing them down to the point that @entity3 's political system is still recovering from it , " he said			1
" unfortunately the consequences of his actions ruined so many people 's lives			0
one has to wonder how @entity3 is going to deal with that			0
" according to an article in the @entity3 constitution , which was written by the military junta in 1982 , @entity11 and his fellow officers were protected from prosecution			1
but recent constitutional changes drafted and ratified by prime minister @entity92 's ruling @entity91 cleared the way for a prosecutor to question @entity11 at his home last year			2
@entity92 's government has also overseen the arrest and trial of dozens of other army generals accused of a much more recent military coup plot , which was never successfully carried out			1
according to @entity2 , authorities arrested retired general @entity102 on tuesday in connection to the more recent plot			2
and last week , authorities detained retired general @entity106 , who commanded the @entity3 armed forces until 2010			0
some critics have called the prosecutions a witch hunt , targeting political opponents of @entity92 's government			0
other argue it has been a vital process to bring the military under the control of elected civilian leaders			0
since 1960 , the once politically - dominant @entity3 armed forces have overthrown four governments			0
" ending the belief of impunity is very , very important , " said @entity58 of ' @entity61 ' newspaper , which has published many damning reports about the @entity3 military in recent years			2
" it 's a huge step , obviously very late			0
these generals are very old			0
but it 's still symbolically very important for this country			0

@entity3 court approves indictments in 1980 military coup , @entity2 reports
former army general @entity11 and air force chief @entity14 are named
while initially welcomed , @entity11 's military junta was blamed for human rights abuses
the country is still *struggling* with the coup 's aftermath , *observers* say
