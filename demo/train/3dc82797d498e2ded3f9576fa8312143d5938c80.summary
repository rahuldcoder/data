@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of towns along the swollen @entity5 on sunday packed up their valuables and made last - ditch efforts to place sandbags and makeshift levees outside their homes , trying to protect themselves and their homes from rising waters			1
" i have never experienced anything like this in my life , " said @entity13 , 24 , as he was hitching up his trailer home in @entity0 , @entity1 , to move it to higher ground			0
" these efforts occurred as the @entity22 opened two additional gates sunday morning on the @entity24 , located about 115 miles northwest of @entity25			1
this is after opening the first two bays the previous day			0
a collective gasp as @entity1 town braces for flood the plan is to let out water from as many as one - fourth of the spillway 's 125 bays to spare the @entity1 cities of @entity37 and @entity25 from severe flooding , corps spokesman @entity31 has said			1
but it maystill affect nearly 4,000 people who live along the river , as it sends water toward homes and farmland in the @entity45 , according to @entity1 gov. @entity46			0
" at this time , we are currently monitoring the river , but it is too early to know if additional gates will be opened today , " @entity31 wrote in an e-mail to @entity2			0
some of the spillway 's gates will likely be open for weeks , and it 'll be at least that long before the river falls safely below flood stage and those who have evacuated can safely return , said col. @entity55 , the @entity56 district commander			1
stars talk about the flooding and response @entity55 said the decision to open the spillway , along with similar decisions made in recent weeks as the floodwaters moved southward , was done to address a historic excess of water in the @entity5 and its tributaries			1
while the spillways will divert water away from @entity1 cities , low - lying central parts of the state will be flooded			1
across the @entity73 and lower @entity74 , floodwaters have already covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said			0
authorities in @entity83 issued a mandatory evacuation that affected about 2,000 people -- including about 750 people living in 240 homes in @entity0			1
residents in other areas were under a voluntary evacuation , with authorities encouraging but not ordering them to leave			1
@entity91 , the parish 's president , said sunday afternoon that water levels in @entity0 appear lower than expected -- though he said he thought they 'd rise considerably after midnight , and especially if and when more floodgates are opened			1
@entity97 's @entity96 inspired by fans in flooded @entity99 " it 's the fear of the unknown , " @entity91 said , noting estimates that the water could rise 10 to 15 feet in spots			1
" these are predictions , no one knows for sure what will happen			0
" @entity108 posted a video of flooded homes in @entity111 , @entity1 , about 30 miles north of @entity37			0
he said he shot the video on saturday , after the first gate was opened on the spillway			0
@entity116 said he lives in @entity37 and was visiting his fiancee 's parents in @entity111			2
some city residents " were waiting until the last second to leave , " he said sunday , while others used whatever they could to try to minimize damage to their homes for when the high waters roll in			0
" there were a few seemingly futile attempts to put sandbags up , " said @entity116			0
following the opening of the spillway , the @entity128 revised its flood forecasts and lowered projected cresting levels in some @entity1 towns			0
forecasters also said the river may crest earlier than first thought in some areas			0
" the river at @entity37 through @entity25 will crest sooner than upstream locations due to @entity24 spillway operations , " said the latest forecast , issued saturday			1
" after crests , stages will remain at the same levels and @entity25 will fluctuate near flood stage while @entity145 and @entity24 are operated			1
" authorities previously opened gates on the @entity145 , located upstream from @entity24			1
already on sunday , waters in @entity150 , @entity5 , had reached record levels of 56.2 feet , the weather service reported			1
this is well above the 43 - foot flood stage , but still short of the forecasted crest of 57.5 feet on thursday			2
levels in @entity156 , further south downriver , were two feet higher than the record set in 1937 on sunday , but just under three feet shy of the 63 - foot crest expected saturday			2
the weather service said the river was also cresting sunday in @entity25 and @entity161 , @entity1 , because of the spillway operations			0
at @entity161 , the river was cresting at 28.2 feet , above the historic 1929 flood level of 26 feet			0
at @entity25 , however , the crest was 17 feet , about four feet below the historic level of 1922			0
@entity166 explained residents were counting on a levee for protection			2
in addition to the mainline levee along the river , starting near @entity150 and extending northeast for more than 20 miles , a so - called backwater levee offers shelter			1
the backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the @entity177 delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it			2
@entity181 , the @entity182 's chief engineer , said sunday there was a " remote " chances the levees could be breached , though he expressed confidence they would hold			1
even if it stays intact , the expectation is excess water will rush over them for several days			2
" there will be a lot of sleepless nights , when this thing starts overtopping , " @entity181 said			0
" it will be a very stressful time for everyone			2
" @entity2 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			2
