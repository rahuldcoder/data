@entity0 , @entity1 -- for more than a year , experts have been at work in a quiet cove on the @entity6 , teaching a pair of male bottlenose dolphins how to catch their own food			1
every day , the team releases dozens of live fish into giant sea pen where the dolphins named @entity14 and @entity15 live			2
the two males then race around the pen , diving , darting and somersaulting down to depths of 45 feet in pursuit of their frightened prey			0
like a proud father , trainer @entity22 watches from the narrow dock that encircles the pen			1
not long ago , he said , @entity14 and @entity15 had no idea what to do with live fish			2
" we had literally thousands of fish in the pen , and they just would n't look at them , " @entity22 said			1
" they had just been so used to being hand - fed in a captive situation that they did not recognize fish as a food source			2
" when @entity22 first met the dolphins more than a year ago , he said they would only eat if humans placed dead fish directly in their mouths			1
if fish was thrown into the pen , it would go untouched and end up rotting at the bottom of the sea pen			0
@entity14 and @entity15 are part of the @entity48 to the @entity50 project , an expensive , risky and somewhat controversial experiment to reintroduce captive animals into the wild			2
" it would be like taking your dog and releasing it into the woods , " @entity22 said			1
" if you do n't prepare your dog for that , it would never happen			0
" @entity22 , a @entity61 - based expert on marine mammals , had experience with another high - profile release program that ultimately ended in failure			1
more than 10 years ago , he worked in @entity66 as part of a multimillion - dollar effort to prepare the killer whale @entity69 from the 1993 movie " @entity72 " for release into the wild			1
less than a year after his release , @entity69 died off @entity76			1
but @entity22 said he believes @entity14 and @entity15 stand a much better chance of survival			1
" these animals have n't been in captivity as long as @entity69 , " he said			1
" @entity69 was held in captivity for more than 20 years			1
he was held as a solitary animal for many of those years			1
" the two dolphins , who are both about 12 years old , have been in captivity for five or six years , he said			1
" they 've probably spent the majority of their life out in the wild , " @entity22 said			1
" because we 're dealing with two males , you can develop competition feeding with them			0
... they 're ideal candidates for reintroduction back into the wild			2
" @entity14 and @entity15 first attracted the attention of wildlife conservation activists in 2010			0
at the time , they were kept at a @entity1 resort , where tourists paid to swim with the dolphins in a shallow , filthy swimming pool			1
" the pool in @entity107 , @entity1 , where @entity14 and @entity15 had spent the summer months of 2010 had such a high bacterial count ... that it was a significant health hazard to the dolphins and for the unsuspecting tourists who paid to swim with them , " @entity110 , a representative of the @entity111 , wrote in an e-mail to @entity2			1
" the water was filthy with feces and dead fish and a layer of ' sludge ' at the bottom			0
" according to @entity111 , a nonprofit conservation group based in the @entity122 , the dolphins were underweight and listless and would not have survived much longer in the pool , which " having been hastily constructed , was in danger of collapse from subsidence			2
" a coalition of environmental groups successfully campaigned to rescue the animals and transport them in the back of a truck to a sea pen in the @entity6			0
@entity111 has taken over the costly and time - consuming program to rehabilitate @entity14 and @entity15			2
so far , the effort has cost $ 800,000			0
both dolphins are expected to be released within a matter of days			2
@entity111 is keeping the exact time and location of their release secret to protect the animals from curious human visitors , excessive boat traffic and the threat of poachers			2
@entity14 and @entity15 's progress will be monitored with specially designed satellite tracking devices that will be pinned to their dorsal fins			0
even the sponsors of the program admit there is no guarantee of success			0
" there have only been a handful of reintroduction ( programs ) with mixed results , " @entity110 wrote			0
" returning any captive wild animal to the wild is never without risk			1
" one of the only successful cetacean reintroductions on record involved an orphaned female orca named @entity164			0
@entity22 was a member of the team that helped rehabilitate the emaciated animal and eventually reintroduce her to a pod of related killer whales off @entity171 's @entity170 a decade ago			1
she has reportedly survived and thrived in those waters			0
@entity174 , a marine mammal expert at the @entity175 , predicted major challenges for @entity14 and @entity15 in the weeks and months ahead			0
" can they break the bond with humans , and can they create a bond with other ( wild ) dolphins ? " he asked in a phone interview with @entity2			2
" the irony is that if these animals do get released into the wild , it 's a big , bad world out there , and they will have to learn how not to get entangled in fishing gear			0
" according to @entity174 , @entity14 and @entity15 's release will have virtually no impact on the world 's wild dolphin population , which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets , decimated fish stocks and polluted seas			1
but he and other dolphin experts say successful reintroduction could both increase biodiversity awareness in @entity1 and set an important example for the multimillion - dollar captive marine mammal entertainment industry			1
there has been a rapid increase in the number of dolphinariums and " swim - with - dolphin " programs cropping up across @entity1 over the last decade			1
" @entity1 , being a very popular and beautiful holiday destination , is sadly responding to the public demand for that ' dolphin experience ' by providing more captive dolphin facilities than anywhere else in @entity212 , " @entity111 's @entity110 wrote			1
" conditions in general are very poor			0
" @entity22 said he hopes @entity1 will start implementing some regulations for its marine mammal facilities " because there really are n't standards right now			1
" one fear is that @entity14 and @entity15 , who enjoy being rubbed down and handled by their trainers , could be captured by poachers hoping to sell the valuable animals to dolphin parks			1
despite the risks , perhaps one of the great assets shared by the two dolphins is their adaptability			0
" they are not lions and tigers , " said @entity174 of the @entity175			0
" they 're fundamentally more plastic and more adaptable			0
" proof of this adaptability is on display nearly every day in the congested and polluted waters of the @entity237 , which courses through the center of @entity240			0
a vibrant pod of dozens of wild bottlenose dolphins feeds here , dodging the constant traffic of oil tankers , cargo ships , ferryboats , fishing boats and yachts			2
occasionally , the animals can be seen leaping and surfing off the bows of enormous tanker ships			0
@entity15 and @entity14 are to be released in much less hazardous waters hundreds of miles from @entity240			0
but even their " coach " does n't know how they will fare in the days ahead			0
" we just really do n't know how they 're going to respond , " @entity22 said , stroking @entity14 's glistening hide after the 600 - pound animal obediently lept onto a floating dock at his trainers ' command			1
clearly , freedom will expose these dolphins to stimulation they have not encountered in years , including waterbirds , fish and female dolphins			2
after a wave from his trainer 's hand , @entity14 slipped back into the water			0
he issued a high - pitched call before accepting a fish as a reward			0
underwater , the vocalizations of both @entity14 and @entity15 could be distinctly heard , even by the human ear			0
despite years of close interaction between humans and these highly intelligent animals , scientists have not found a way to answer one fundamental question : after years in captivity , do dolphins such as @entity14 and @entity15 want to be free ?			2

trainer @entity22 is working to release two dolphins into the wild
two years ago , the dolphins were the main attraction at a run - down @entity1 tourist park
@entity22 worked to help release @entity69 , the orca from the 1993 movie " @entity72 "
popular " swim with dolphin " parks in @entity1 are a concern to animal *welfare* *advocates*
