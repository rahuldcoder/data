-- my sixth grader has a secret life online			1
it was n't so secret about a week ago when i discovered his public profile on @entity6 , where he was posting dramatic photos and soulful " @entity10 " ( graphical text messages ) , for all the world to see			1
one moment he was in love , the next full of despair			0
my 11 - year - old son has never let on that he is remotely interested in girls			2
and he 's not exactly the middle school kid with swagger			0
he 's a relatively shy guy			0
yet , his @entity6 avatar was boldly flirting with a girl , prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends , but also from a far - flung social network of kids from @entity31 to @entity32 who i am certain he 's never met in person			1
his phone was beeping nonstop for three days , with a stream of frenzied text messages and @entity6 posts			1
something big was going on			0
my son wanted to ask a girl out			2
did she like him , too ? he was n't sure , but from what i saw online , this was hardly confidential information			1
his plan for asking her out was getting circulated in cyberspace and he had several kids weighing in on both the strategy and his likelihood for success			0
he was fully exposed on multiple virtual platforms , and that was terrifying to me			0
he clearly did n't understand the full impact of online activity			1
what should i do ? young people and social media : docs examine pitfalls when my son was sleeping , i was checking the text messages and followed the @entity6 updates -- after all , this was n't really sneaking if my son maintained a public profile			1
but what could i say ? should i tell him that i am monitoring his moves ? was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary ? was i violating my son 's privacy and simply making too much of this ? my husband told me to back off , that our son was merely a kid with a crush who needed to experience this rite of passage on his own , without a hovering mother			1
but i was n't so sure			2
like many parents , i am struggling with the boundaries of monitoring my kids ' online activities			1
is it an invasion of our children 's privacy to intercept or check their text messages , or have the rules changed for parents because of the pure power and danger of technology ? am i justified in cyberstalking my own son ? a first crush is hard enough , but i am trying to protect him from the embarrassment that can come from exposing this personal experience online			1
adults know that a careless e-mail , text message , tweet or photo posting can cost someone not only their reputation , but also their career			0
the scandal over former cia director @entity112 ' extramarital affair apparently started with an e-mail breach			0
if the @entity116 director can get sloppy with personal e-mails , how can we trust a kid to handle these tools any better ? how to raise a winning child experts say that it 's important for parents to proactively monitor their kids ' online behavior			1
" it 's snooping only if we do n't tell them we 're doing it , " said @entity126 the author of the best - selling " @entity129 " series			2
" you need to have the discussion up front about why you are there and why you are monitoring their online activity			1
passively knowing that a parent is present can alter kids ' behavior online			2
parents wo n't intrude on their kids ' experience if they do it in a way that 's upfront and straightforward			2
" parenting in a @entity148 era where a new , must - have , social media app is churned out every two minutes makes monitoring exhausting , if not impossible			2
but while i believe my son knows not to communicate with " strangers , " the way he 's exposing his life in cyberspace is making me tense			1
but he 's hardly alone			0
the photos and messages that his fellow tween friends post on @entity160 between silly and provocative			0
maybe it 's the digital photo - filters , but the girls seem sexy beyond their years			0
while it 's our duty as parents to teach our kids responsibility with technology , how much can we interfere with their freedom of expression ? @entity126 says it 's important that parents are educated about what 's out there and are on top of their kids ' online behavior without getting totally crazy			2
he says that parents ca n't just hand their kids digital devices and expect that they understand netiquette			1
but at the same time , parents need to respect boundaries			0
confessions of a busy mom : 5 lessons " just because you can see what 's online does n't mean that you should obsess over it and micromanage every text message , " @entity126 said			1
" there are boundaries for parents as well			0
and at the end of the day , you do n't want to become paranoid			2
you really just want to open an honest dialogue and positive computing			0
you ca n't put your kid on a leash , virtual or otherwise			1
" after agonizing for a few nights over how to handle it all , i told my son that he needed to change his settings to private so pedophiles and other " creepy people " ca n't follow his posts			1
he 's a clever kid and understood that i was on to him			0
it was an unspoken acknowledgment that i had seen what he was putting out there			0
so he 's gone private			2
i asked if i could follow him on @entity6 and he immediately said no. @entity126 would say that parents need to " friend " their kids or follow them online			1
but what if they refuse ? it 's well known that kids can be stealth and may " friend " their parents on one site or app , but post on another			0
parents can pull the plug on the technology perhaps for a little while , or you can sneak a peak at their phones and devices , like i do regularly now , without any guilt			0
like @entity233 on @entity234 do you use events like the @entity238 case to educate your teens ? share your take in the comments section below .			0

@entity243 found out her son had a secret @entity6 *account* and considered intervening
finding the balance between monitoring online activities and *invading* privacy is a *challenge*
one *solution* : have your child change their settings to private , so strangers ca n't follow them
