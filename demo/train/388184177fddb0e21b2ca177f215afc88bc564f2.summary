-- sen. @entity1 , saying he sees few tangible benefits for passengers , called sunday on the @entity4 to reverse its decision to allow small pocketknives on airplanes			1
at an afternoon news conference in @entity9 , @entity1 said @entity4 agents would be distracted by having to measure knives and other items like baseball bats			1
" these items are dangerous , and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes , " the @entity9 @entity14 said			1
" now is not the time for reduced vigilance , or to place additional burdens on @entity4 agents who should be looking for dangerous items			1
" during the news conference , @entity1 held up a slender bladed object that he said would be allowed under the new rules			0
" it looks dangerous and it is dangerous			0
this can kill someone , " he said			0
a representative from @entity1 's office later identified the object as a knife similar to ones made by office supply companies			0
the @entity4 subsequently responded by saying that knife would not be allowed on flights under new regulations because the blade can be locked in place and because the blade appeared to be a razor blade , which remain banned from passenger airplanes			1
@entity1 's request on the @entity4 rule change came a day after @entity45 rep. @entity44 also came out against the @entity4 's move			1
in a letter to @entity4 administrator @entity49 , the @entity47 @entity14 expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed			1
" the attacks on september 11 , 2001 , demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane , even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster , " wrote @entity44 , who is running for the @entity60 seat recently vacated by @entity61			1
" in addition , the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at @entity4 checkpoints , potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security			2
" knives on a plane ? really ? under the rules outlined this week , knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) and less than a half - inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place			2
razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited			0
the rules also allow a passenger to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry - on luggage			2
@entity49 said the move brings the @entity45 into alignment with international rules and is in keeping with his " risk - based security " approach			0
@entity95 , who oversaw the @entity4 from 2005 to 2009 , said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft			2
@entity104 chief backs decision but others have sharply criticized the change , which takes effect april 25			1
they include the @entity109 , a nearly 90,000 - member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the @entity4 's decision			2
the policy is also opposed by the @entity114 , a union representing more than 26,000 officers from 65 agencies			0
@entity118 ceo @entity117 said friday he shares the same " legitimate concerns " as his flight attendants			0
@entity118 ceo opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft " if the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow , there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk - based screening mechanisms , " he wrote in a letter to @entity125			0
@entity0 's @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this story			0

senator from @entity9 says " now is not the time for reduced vigilance "
@entity4 will allow some pocketknives , sports *equipment* as of april 25
they were banned after september 11 , 2001 , attacks
some airline officials also have called for reversal
