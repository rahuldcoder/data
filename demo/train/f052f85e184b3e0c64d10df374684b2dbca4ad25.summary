-- on any given day here at " @entity3 , " there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 69 very talented , extremely detail oriented , high - energy , hardworking women and men all doing their jobs and doing them well			1
i love a few of them , i like a lot of them , i despise one of them			1
she is the @entity16 to my @entity17 , the @entity18 to my @entity19 , the @entity20 to my @entity21			1
it 's a typical tuesday ; the office is humming along			1
i 'm answering e-mails , writing cover lines , scheduling a dental appointment here , partial highlights there , kicking myself for not getting sushi at lunch			1
the sun is shining , the color printer is working -- my life is good			1
i mosey into the ladies ' room , glance at the mirror , remind myself that fluorescent lights make everyone look as if they 're in the final stages of tuberculosis , and head for a stall			1
and then i see it : the seat , even the floor , is covered in little yellow droplets			1
to date , i have been able to deduce only four things about her : 1			2
she attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. 3			2
she was raised in a barn			2
i 've been her victim more times than i can count , and it has turned me from a happy - go - lucky columnist into a bitter , paranoid germaphobe			1
she has become the bane of my existence			2
we live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor , where @entity67 is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news , where the @entity74 still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the @entity78 case was closed , where studies indicate that worrying you 're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet i am devoting an entire column to @entity49			2
any shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family			2
but what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they do n't feel like it and think it would n't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while ? i 've been earning a paycheck for 30 years			2
whether rinsing conditioner off a @entity109 apso during my stint as shampoo girl at mr. @entity112 or breathing on the chicken breast i was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days , i 've always found that the people i work with matter to me			2
their moods , their opinions , their style influence my life			2
they 've appreciated me , humiliated me , surprised me , and antagonized me			2
i 've gotten flowers and i 've gotten fired ( and i 'm pretty sure i did n't do anything to deserve either ) , but i 've never experienced anything like @entity22			1
" dammit ! " i say upon encountering her latest @entity126 imitation			2
@entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 each come out of their stalls to see what 's wrong			1
@entity128 groans , @entity129 moans , @entity135 throws up her hands in disgust , and we fall into silence			2
then i rally , " at least we know it 's not one of us			1
" but everybody else is a suspect			2
" it ca n't be @entity145 , " @entity129 volunteers			2
" what are you basing this on ? " i ask			0
" i 've seen her , " she answers , " she always heads straight for the paper seat protector			1
" " and , " @entity130 adds , " we can cross @entity155 off the list -- it happened twice while she was in @entity158			0
" sixty seconds ago , the four of us were editors ; now we are @entity160 profilers			0
" she probably likes to burrow into small spaces , " @entity128 conjectures			0
" this never happens in the big , wheelchair - accessible stall ... " " it 's very primitive , as if she 's marking her territory			1
this is clearly a hostile gesture , " @entity129 declares with authority			0
we 're finally getting somewhere			0
" so , really , " i say , " we just need to be on the lookout for an aggressively mean - spirited , mole - like cavewoman who is not confined to a wheelchair			1
. is that right ? " @entity135 is the first to realize that we 're losing our minds			0
" i 'm out of here , " she says , and exits the ladies ' room			0
later , i complain to @entity180 , poor , naive little @entity180			0
. she tells me that it ca n't be any of us , that the toilet is somehow to blame			0
i leave @entity180 in her special world -- a place where troubles melt like lemon drops and @entity188 acted alone -- and resume writing my column			0
@entity190 drops by and reads over my shoulder			0
suddenly she has an epiphany : " it 's you ! " she announces , pointing at me like she 's @entity194 accusing @entity195 of stealing silver candlesticks			1
" think about it , " she says			0
" what better way to cover your tracks than writing an outraged piece on the subject ? " i kind of like that @entity190 believes i am an evil genius , and i do n't have the heart to tell her that i once refused to sit my daughter on the lap of a department store @entity208 because i had no idea who else had been sitting there			0
another day , another bathroom break			1
" steer clear of the third stall , " @entity213 warns as she dries her hands and heads for a meeting			0
@entity218 emerges from door number four to see what exactly 's going on behind door number three			1
she is appalled yet philosophical			0
" believe it or not , every place i 've ever worked has had a @entity49 -- maybe sharing a ladies ' room just sends certain people into a passive - aggressive snit			1
it 's the dark side of office life			1
" lately , my daydreams bear a striking resemblance to one of those black - and - white @entity234 movies : the entire team sits , sipping brandy in an ornate drawing room			1
" i suppose you 're wondering why i 've gathered you here today , " i begin in an inexplicable @entity239 accent			0
" well , my friends , one of you is the @entity49			0
" the research department averts their eyes			0
the art department fidgets nervously			0
" and , " i go on , " nobody is leaving this room until i reveal the person who refuses to work and play well with others			0
" my assistant , @entity251 , looks up			0
" you mean you 've figured out the identity of @entity22 ? " she asks , filled with an admiration for my powers of reasoning that she has never once expressed in real life			1
" it was elementary , dear @entity258			0
i merely -- " but before i can unmask @entity22 or explain why i refer to @entity251 as dear @entity258 , the lights suddenly go out ... i could go on , but i 'm bored silly whenever someone feels compelled to relay every nanosecond of a dream			1
suffice it to say that i usually wind up in the arms of @entity266			0
as for @entity22 ? she 's still on the lam			1
there are lots of days when i find myself wishing life were closer to a gorgeous movie from the ' 40s -- women wore fabulous hats and pearl chokers , and i do n't think they actually went to the bathroom back then			1
they were too busy dancing with @entity279 and smoking unfiltered cigarettes to schlep to an office every day			0
now , some of us are running the offices , but it seems we 've brought a few low - grade lunatics along for the ride -- and they 're wreaking havoc in the ladies ' room			1
where have you gone , @entity293 ? i 'm not asking for cloth napkins and classical music			0
i do n't need a mint on my pillow			0
i just want a bit of common courtesy , a modicum of civility , @entity302 , or , failing all that , a good supply of @entity304			1
