@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is cramming college into three years to cut down on the cost of her student loans			1
as it is , the @entity8 sophomore expects to graduate in a few years with $ 20,000 in debt			0
" i try not to think about it too much , " said @entity3 , " the last thing i want is to be financially dependent on my parents			0
" @entity3 is scared of the student loan bills she may face when she graduates in a few years			1
but come july , millions of college graduates may see their payments jump			2
that 's when the interest rate on federally subsidized college loans is set to double			1
unless @entity21 decides to freeze current interest rates , the more than 7 million @entity20 will see their annual rates jump from 3.4 % to 6.8 %			1
just the thought of that , said @entity3 , " definitely makes my anxiety go up several notches			0
" the issue is fast becoming a political football , and one president @entity30 hopes to score with young voters			1
but his likely @entity33 opponent is trying to take the ball off the field by also supporting the freeze			0
@entity38 camp : why we will get the young people this week , @entity30 begins an all - out push for @entity21 to extend the low rates on these loans			1
" we ca n't make higher education a luxury , " he said during a rally in @entity1 tuesday			2
" it 's an economic imperative			2
every @entity20 family should be able to afford it			0
" that message is red meat to the college crowd , a group the president has to energize in big numbers before november			2
in 2008 , the president won two - thirds of 18 - 29 year olds			0
sen. @entity59 won 32 %			0
that year young voters made up one - fifth of the electorate			0
that may not sound like a large enough voting block to decide an election but , on the state level , young voters can make a big difference			0
in @entity1 during the last election , @entity30 won by just 1 % , or 14,177 votes			1
but he carried the state 's young voters by an overwhelming 74 %			0
the youth vote clearly helped provide a cushion for his upset victory and the state 's 15 electoral votes			1
since then , the dynamic has changed			0
youth turnout dropped 6 % between the 2008 presidential election and the 2010 midterms			2
though a drop off in turnout among young voters is predictable when there 's no presidential candidate on the ticket , there are other reasons the @entity30 team has to worry about a lower turnout			1
young people have been hit especially hard during the recession , with more than half of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed			1
and a recent @entity96 survey showed that while young people still overwhelmingly support @entity30 , they are now less likely to vote this fall , more disillusioned about the economy and politics in general			1
" it 's not too late for @entity30 to relight some fires , " said @entity101 , public policy professor at @entity8			1
" i do not think it 's possible for him to ignite the kind of conflagration in the entire youth that he did last time			2
" @entity101 believes young voters are easily disillusioned by the gridlock in @entity111			0
they " essentially looked up and said ' but it did n't work right away so the hell with it			2
' and that 's always a problem with the youth vote			1
" student loan rate hike : what you need to know so the president is now stepping up his effort to appeal to young voters			1
this week he 's visiting college campuses in states he carried in 2008 and those that will be in play in 2012 -- @entity1 , @entity129 and @entity130			2
he is pushing the " keep - college - loans - affordable " message and pointing the finger at @entity33			1
his speech in @entity1 included an attack on a @entity33 congresswoman for her position on student loans			2
he did n't mention her name but the president recounted the comments of rep. @entity142 ( @entity143 ) who had told a talk radio host that she had " very little tolerance " for students who graduate with large amounts of debt			2
" can you imagine that ? " the president asked the crowd , which responded with loud boos			0
what he does n't mention is that @entity38 came out this week in favor of extending a freeze on the current interest rates			1
" with the number of college graduates who ca n't find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level , i fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans , " @entity38 said before a campaign event in @entity161 , @entity162 on monday			1
@entity38 is making a play to dampen enthusiasm for the president among young voters			1
at the @entity162 event he told reporters , " i think this is a time when young people are questioning the support they gave to president @entity30 three and a half years ago			1
" one issue the @entity38 campaign is certain to hit on : the unemployment rate among 20 - 24 year olds is five points higher than the national average			2
in his comments on the youth vote , @entity38 added , " he ( the president ) promised a future with good jobs and good opportunity ; that has n't happened			1
" but it may be in the administration 's interests to keep the subject in the headlines , continuing to suggest that the @entity33 will stand in the way of a deal			0
it will cost the @entity20 $ 6 billion to extend the student loans for just one year , according to the @entity205			0
@entity206 , the @entity33 chairman of the @entity207 , has called it an " untenable situation " in which " we must now choose between allowing interest rates to rise or piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers			0
" @entity206 said he is working to find " a responsible solution " -- a way to pay for an extension of the freeze			0
on tuesday , @entity30 attacked @entity21 for continuing subsidies for oil companies and for its failure to increase taxes on the wealthy , leading the crowd to chants of " no ! " to questions such as " do we want tax cuts for the rich ? " the current interest rate reduction passed with bipartisan support in 2007 , but @entity33 have pointed out that then - sen. @entity30 missed two votes on the issue			1
the @entity230 has pointed out the president was campaigning at the time and was prepared to return to cast his ballot if needed for the vote ; then - sen. @entity235 and sens. @entity236 and @entity59 also missed the vote			0
the back and forth in @entity111 is seen as just more noise to the students who face a rate increase on july 1			0
@entity3 , the @entity8 sophomore , said her biggest fear is the possibility she 'll be so deeply in debt , she 'll have to move into her parent 's home after graduation			0
" yeah it 's the 800 - pound guerilla in the room			0
it 's everyone 's plan @entity253 wants to go all the way to that			0

college grads face student loan rates that could double if @entity21 does n't act
@entity30 pushing hard for freezing rates while *shoring* up youth vote
@entity38 also supports plan , but *blames* @entity30 for economic problems of youth
