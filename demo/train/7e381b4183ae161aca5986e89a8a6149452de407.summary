-- @entity2 presidents have come and gone -- but one club tends to unite them all			1
so often a meeting point for the captains of politics and industry , the golf course has been one of the most popular friends of @entity2 leaders since the early part of the 20th century			1
from @entity14 , the 27th president , who introduced the game to the @entity16 , through to @entity17 , the game has remained a constant in @entity2 political life			1
if @entity17 has been criticized in recent weeks for spending too much time on the course , there are other presidents who have been equally ardent golfers			2
" @entity25 has inspired presidents throughout history , " @entity23 , historian at the @entity24 , told @entity0			1
" it 's good exercise but there 's also the chance for dialogue with people in politics			0
" it 's a game of integrity and presidents have seen golf as the sport of leaders			1
" all but three of the 18 presidents since the start of the 20th century have picked up a club during their time at the @entity16			1
@entity45 felt it was inappropriate to be seen on the golf course during the @entity48 , while neither @entity49 nor @entity50 were particularly keen on the sport			2
@entity52 was a keen golfer , but like @entity45 , he too was wary of public perception so curtailed his playing when in office			0
while @entity2 troops were fighting in @entity56 and @entity57 , he would later recall , he refrained from playing as a mark of respect			1
according to @entity61 , it was @entity14 who was one of the first presidents to take up golf during his 1909 - 13 tenure			1
a big man , @entity14 struggled with the more physically demanding sports , and local newspapers often published cartoons mocking his size			1
but even though he was a rather portly figure , golf was one sport he managed to play without too many problems			2
his love for golf was nothing compared to his successor , @entity79			2
@entity79 was fanatical about the sport , says @entity61 , even ordering his secret service guards to paint his golf balls so he could practice his driving in the snow			2
during his time in office , which lasted for eight years until 1921 , @entity79 played over 1,000 rounds of golf			2
he often spent time swinging his clubs while debating policy and even met his second wife , @entity91 , after playing a round of golf -- and she later took up the game as first lady			0
while several commanders in @entity98 enjoyed golf , it was @entity100 who really established it as the sport of presidents			1
" @entity100 played over 800 rounds during his tenure , " says @entity23			1
" he would practice every morning and had a putting green just outside his office where he would dictate to his secretary			0
" it was @entity100 's friendship with leading professional @entity111 which really helped to establish golf in the @entity2 , according to @entity23			1
the men were two of the nation 's most famous faces during the 1950s and 1960s and their friendship blossomed through the sport			0
@entity111 won seven major titles during his illustrious career , four of which came at the masters at @entity123 , a particular favorite with @entity100			1
" both @entity111 and @entity100 peaked at the same time , " says @entity23			1
" they had a shared passion for the game and played lots of rounds together			0
they really helped to create a secondary boom for golf in the @entity2 " @entity111 in particular had great appeal			1
he was handsome , played with a real swashbuckling style , was a risk taker and was exciting to watch			0
" both him and @entity100 transcended the sport			1
" @entity100 made 45 trips to @entity123 -- five before he took up residence at the @entity16 , 29 as president and 11 after his time in office			1
the @entity142 , which was built in the 1950s , still stands and is one of 10 cabins on the course			0
@entity100 's @entity147 , a three - acre water hazard which sits next to the eighth and ninth holes , still remains but the famous old tree which once adorned the course is no longer			1
the @entity152 , which stood next to the 17th hole , was removed in march 2014 after suffering structural damage			0
the @entity155 , standing at some 65 feet , was estimated to be over 120 years old and was a constant nuisance to @entity100 , who wanted it removed			2
at a club meeting in 1956 , @entity100 , who had a habit of managing to hit the tree on many an occasion , was overruled by @entity123 chairman @entity162 , who refused to have the tree torn down			2
while @entity100 's enthusiasm for golf could not be doubted , his skill levels failed to match those of other presidents			1
according to @entity23 , @entity169 was the most talented golfing leader , while @entity170 could also unleash a mean drive			1
@entity172 was also an aficionado , occasionally putting down the aisles on @entity175			0
" @entity169 was probably the best golfer to have been president , " says @entity23			2
" he did n't play as much as the others but he was keen not to attract attention			0
" he played on the @entity180 golf team and was a single - digit handicapper			0
" @entity170 played in tournaments and while he could be erratic , sometimes hitting people in the gallery , he was a good athlete and had a good drive			0
" in more recent times , @entity186 has entertained on the golf course , even joking that he 's the only president whose handicap went down during a term in office			0
while @entity192 had previously removed the @entity16 putting green , @entity186 had it reinstalled			2
@entity186 now hosts his own @entity194 tournament in @entity195 , having taken over the ailing @entity196 a decade after the comedian passed away and renaming it the @entity196			0
in 1995 , while in office , @entity186 played at the event in a pro-am team with @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and defending champion @entity204			0
" presidents need to rest their minds , not just their bodies , " @entity186 told @entity205 in 2012			0
" they need the exercise , the fresh air			0
and they need to do something that , literally , takes them away from what they 're doing			0
" the day i played with president @entity17 , i 'd had about three hours ' sleep , and i was so exhausted i could barely stand up			0
" but when the president calls and asks you to play golf , you show up			0
" @entity220 : @entity221 brings lessons for @entity224 generation @entity220 : @entity225 shows @entity2 patriotism with haircut			2

golf has been a *pastime* for @entity2 presidents for over a century
