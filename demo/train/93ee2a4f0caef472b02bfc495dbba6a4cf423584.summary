@entity0 , @entity1 what would @entity3 do ? the central figure in " @entity11 , " the hit sci - fi series about an oppressed people 's struggle against a totalitarian regime , is being evoked for real , now , in @entity1 among university students expressing their opposition to that southeast @entity16 nation 's military rulers			1
several students , from @entity0 to about 450 kilometers ( 280 miles ) away to the northeast , have been detained in recent days after flashing the signature anti-establishment , three - fingered salute from " @entity11			1
" by thursday evening , all of those held had been released , according to lawyers			0
at that point , according to @entity27 's @entity26 , about 100 police and military troops had congregated then at a busy cinema in the @entity1 capital where " @entity11 : @entity31 " was set to debut			1
' prohibited by martial law ' asked about the arrests of students who flashed the salute and others accused of organizing a protest meeting revolving around the @entity40 - starring movie , a government official told @entity2 that the " military is working on reducing conflicts from various political groups			1
" allowing such political statements , he said , could inflame tensions in the unsettled nation			0
" seeing a movie is a personal thing , and they all have a right to do that , " said maj. gen. @entity47			0
" but if , after seeing the movie , there are political activities involved , this is prohibited by martial law , which has been imposed since ( last may 's ) military intervention			2
" @entity47 added , " if we allow one group to hold political activities , then ( other ) groups would want to do the same thing			0
we would never achieve peace and order , which we are trying to restore			0
" yet there 's little indication the opposition is going away , nor is there anything like national elections on the immediate horizon suggesting a return to civilian rule			2
military takes over in @entity1 opposition uses pop culture such political turmoil is hardly new to @entity1			1
its military has attempted 19 coups -- 12 of them successful -- in the past 80 years			2
the world , of course , has changed a lot over that time , as have the tools and inspirations of opposition groups			0
one protest leader , @entity86 , has been especially pivotal in using pop culture references straight out of @entity88 to spread the movement 's message			2
that includes the story of @entity93 -- a teenage girl who competes in a spectacle of blood lust known as the @entity97 and becomes a leader in the revolution against a tyrannical government			2
a " @entity97 " fan club , which consists of university students calling for democracy in @entity1 , had planned to meet for the latest film 's showing thursday at one @entity0 theater			1
but the showing at that theater and three others that are part of the same @entity111 chain was canceled -- for " technical " reasons , according to the chain			0
@entity114 , from the @entity115 , said the theater 's management gave them refunds for tickets they had bought in advance			2
that meant they could n't watch the movie there , but -- with it opening elsewhere around @entity1 -- the group still planned to meet and see the film somewhere else			2
some detained students sign agreement a young activist , @entity134 student @entity132 , was taken to a police station and then to a military facility for flashing the @entity97 salute at a @entity0 cinema , according to her friend @entity139			1
@entity145 was let go hours later , after signing an agreement promising not to take part in future political activities , human rights lawyer @entity140 said			2
five @entity147 students were asked to sign the same such agreement thursday , a day after they were detained for eight hours after throwing up the three - fingered salute while wearing shirts bearing the words " do n't want a military coup			1
" video from @entity2 affiliate @entity157 shows students being led away by authorities , a few feet from prime minister @entity153 , after revealing their shirts and holding their fingers aloft			1
" it is ok , just gently take them away , we will definitely take care of them , " @entity153 said from a stage , where he was addressing civil servants			0
" this just makes things more difficult if we do n't understand each other			0
" the grinning prime minister then elicits laughs by saying , " anyone else want to protest ? " two of the students ending up signing the agreement vowing not to partake in political activities , but the others refused			1
after intense talks , those three were let go without any conditions -- though by then they did n't want to go home out of fear of the military , according to @entity184 , from the group @entity185			0
invited to have an ' attitude adjustment ' @entity47 , the military government 's spokesman , said @entity153 -- who was the army 's chief before taking over as prime minister following the may coup -- told him what happened in @entity192 was " very minor " and that he thinks " they are still very young			1
" " when they grow up they will understand in what we are doing , " @entity47 said , summarizing @entity153 's sentiments			0
as to how the government is handling dissent , the major general insisted the " military have been very lenient toward these activists			1
" " we 'll try to negotiate first , but if they still refuse to listen to us , we 'd try to convince them through their parents , " he said			0
" and lastly , we would invite them to have attitude adjustment			0
" @entity211 , @entity27 's @entity212 , thinks it 's @entity1 's military government that needs an adjustment			1
" life in @entity1 is growing more absurd by the day , " he says , and " all evidence suggests the so - called roadmap to democracy ... is really a roadmap to nowhere			1
" " someone needs to inform @entity153 that if his system of government is threatened by young people emulating a @entity88 movie , " @entity211 adds , " it is ( a ) pretty sure sign that things need to change			0
" @entity2 's @entity227 reported from @entity0 and @entity228 wrote this story from @entity230 .			0
