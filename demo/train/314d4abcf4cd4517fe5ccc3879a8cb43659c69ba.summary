-- reports that @entity2 is plotting to attack @entity4 targets in @entity5 in response to @entity4 intervention in @entity8 should come as no surprise			1
armed conflicts are unpredictable and risky			0
but this latest communication , allegedly intercepted by @entity4 intelligence , may prove less ominous than it sounds			0
according to an article in the @entity14 , the @entity4 intercepted a message sent from @entity16 to militants in neighboring @entity5 , ordering them to target the @entity4 embassy in @entity20 and other @entity4 interests if @entity4 forces strike @entity8			1
assuming that the information is correct -- and not meant by @entity2 to get into @entity4 hands to send a threat -- it would seem that @entity2 will resort to its long - standing practice of using proxy militias and assorted terrorist groups to do its dirty work			1
this is as an alternative to stepping into the conflict with its own forces , which would escalate the war in @entity8 much more dangerously			2
in fact , it does n't make a lot of sense for @entity40 to jump in against the @entity4 , even if @entity8 is @entity2 's closest ally and @entity2 is already providing president @entity42 with weaponry and other support			1
@entity2 , incidentally , has also coordinated with its @entity46 ally , the @entity48 militia @entity49 , which has gone all in , fighting alongside @entity42			1
despite their many threats , neither @entity49 nor @entity2 want to take on the @entity4 , or @entity51 for that matter , to fight in a war they can not win			1
since @entity4 president @entity57 announced he wants to launch military strikes against @entity8 president @entity42 in response to what many nations agree was a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of civilians on august 21 , opponents of @entity4 intervention have expressed fear that the war would spread to a much larger regional , even global conflagration			1
again , there is no way of predicting with certainty how the conflict would unfold , but an @entity2 decision to launch its own armed forces , or even to take major action in other ways against the @entity4 , does not make strategic sense			2
@entity40 fervently wants to see @entity42 emerge victorious in this civil war against a @entity78 opposition			2
but the ruling establishment in @entity2 today is deeply divided over how far their country should go in protecting the @entity8 dictator			1
@entity2 's hard - liners want to push ahead with nuclear enrichment			1
starting a war with the @entity4 before that process is completed would defeat its purpose			2
@entity2 's more moderate politicians , led today by the newly elected president @entity89 and his team , have engaged in an extraordinary campaign of image repair			1
@entity89 tweeted a " @entity94 " greeting on the occasion of the @entity96 , and his foreign minister condemned the @entity98 , a statement that would not be remarkable from almost any other country , but coming from @entity2 is an eyebrow - raiser after the extraordinarily low bar set by former president @entity102			0
in more signs of some powerful @entity2 distancing from @entity8 , another moderate ( by @entity2 standards ) , former president @entity105 , blamed @entity42 for the chemical gas attack			1
@entity2 are sensitive to those charges , since they suffered horrific gas attacks during the war against @entity5 in the 1980s			2
on this issue , @entity105 has now put himself squarely on the opposite side of the hard - liners , who vow @entity4 will suffer the consequences of interfering in @entity8			2
@entity89 , meanwhile , issued a startlingly nonbelligerent warning to @entity4			0
" if something happens to the @entity8 people , " he told the assembly of experts , a key decision - making body in @entity16 , " the @entity120 will do its religious and humanitarian duties to send food and medicine			0
" while @entity89 was launching his @entity94 charm offensive , the head of the @entity127 ' elite @entity126 , @entity128 , darkly warned that a @entity4 attack on @entity8 would result in the " destruction of @entity51			1
" it was @entity128 who reportedly contacted @entity48 militias in @entity5 , some of them trained by the @entity2 , with the instructions to target the @entity4 embassy there			1
@entity49 , too , which is closely linked with the @entity127 , is reportedly awaiting instructions from @entity16 on how to respond to an @entity4 strike			2
@entity49 's leader , @entity141 , took a risky gamble entering the war in @entity8			2
he was once one of the most popular leaders in the @entity146 world , proclaiming that his organization 's only reason for being was to fight @entity51			0
he has now allied himself with @entity8 's @entity42 , a man with blood on his hands , for the sake of protecting the @entity8 regime and @entity2 interests			1
according to the @entity157 newspaper @entity155 , a @entity46 source said @entity49 will attack @entity51 only " after receiving a specific order from @entity2			2
" @entity49 might try to launch some symbolic attack , perhaps a few rockets			0
but the group is bogged down in @entity8			0
the last thing it wants is to trigger a massive @entity51 -- much less an @entity4 -- retaliation			0
whatever the divisions among @entity2 and the concerns of anti-american militias and terrorist groups about taking on the @entity4 , the threats have to be taken seriously			1
and it 's worth remembering that attacks against civilians and other nonmilitary targets can be launched by small groups , providing deniability to their masters			0
the @entity4 is already evacuating nonessential personnel from a number of diplomatic facilities in the @entity180 and has advised @entity4 citizens to stay out of @entity5			0
some of those warnings , however , went into place before the august 21 nerve gas attack and before @entity57 's call for action			0
the @entity8 war was already spreading to other countries			0
the risks did not begin with the @entity4 debate over intervention			0
the plot warnings are a reminder that war is always dangerous			0
but we all knew that			0
the threats do nothing to change the moral and strategic calculus about whether or not to the @entity4 should strike @entity8			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity205 : reports @entity2 urging militants to target @entity4 sites if @entity4 hits @entity8 not surprising
she says it may show @entity2 using proxies to attack rather than take on war it ca n't win
she says @entity2 's @entity48 want @entity42 to prevail but its rulers divided on how much to help
@entity216 : threats must be taken seriously , but moral reason for strike is *unchanged*
