-- world football 's governing body is threatening to take a more hard - line approach to racist abuse after @entity6 president @entity5 called for clubs to be punished with points deductions and relegation if they are found guilty			1
since @entity11 forward @entity10 walked off the pitch in a friendly match earlier this month , both @entity6 and @entity15 's governing body have faced criticism over their perceived leniency towards players being racially abused			1
" it is not enough to give a fine , " @entity5 told @entity6			1
" playing a game without spectators is one of the possible sanctions , but the best would be the deduction of points and the relegation of a team , because finally the club is responsible for their spectators			1
" @entity5 's stance is something of a volte - face given two years ago he said racism did not exist in football and that any problems could be solved with a handshake			1
but the 76 - year - old , who has spent the past 15 years in charge of @entity6 , has changed his view following a number of recent unsavory incidents			2
@entity42 presses charges after @entity11 soccer racism " it is a phenomena where football is a victim of our society , " added @entity5			1
" discrimination and racism is everywhere in our society			0
we in football can not be made responsible for what happens in our society			0
" but nowhere in the world -- regarding all the problems you can have in your private life , in business , in politics -- can you solve a problem by running away			0
" i agree with and support the movement of @entity10 -- as i have said -- as it was a strong warning			2
it is now up to us to take the adequate steps			0
" what i feel we should do is give instructions to our national associations and the confederations -- specifically to the disciplinary committees -- to be very strong			0
" the ugly face of racism has reared its head far too often over the past 18 months with several high - profile incidents catching the headlines			2
@entity77 fined , suspended over racist remarks in december 2011 , @entity79 striker @entity77 was hit with an eight - match suspension and $ 63,000 fine after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity82 's @entity81			1
last september , @entity84 captain @entity83 was given a four - game ban and fined $ 347,000 for racially abusing @entity87 defender @entity86			0
then in october 2012 , @entity89 's under - 21 players were subjected to racist chanting during the @entity92 qualifier in @entity93			2
the punishment of a $ 105,000 fine and the order to play one under - 21 match behind closed doors handed out by @entity15 's disciplinary commission was then appealed by the organization as it was seen to be too lenient			1
@entity15 appeals @entity101 sanctions however in an interview with @entity105 radio station @entity104 , @entity15 president @entity102 insisted the @entity107 governing body was in great shape to tackle racism			1
" we have put rules in place with the referees in the @entity114 and @entity115 , " said the @entity105			2
earlier this month @entity6 imposed a one - match spectator ban on @entity117 for racist abuse by their fans of a @entity121 player			2
it was the first time the body had imposed anything more than a fine for racism @entity10 makes racism walkout vow @entity10 - @entity10 walked off the field of play after being subjected to racist chanting by supporters during a friendly game at fourth - tier club @entity134			1
speaking to @entity0 in an exclusive interview following the incident , the @entity11 midfielder insisted he would walk off the field again if he was subjected to more racist chanting			2
" " if it happens again i 'm not going to play anymore , " he said			0
" the referee said : ' do n't worry ' but i said i do worry , it 's not very nice			0
" i was angry and i was sad , but it all came together and i said i do n't want to play anymore			0
there were so many negative emotions that came up with me			0
" i 'm surprised we 're still hearing these things in 2013			0
it 's not the first time in my life that i 've heard these things , but i 'm 25 now and i 've had enough this bulls * * *			0
" @entity10 's decision to walk off the field was applauded by @entity102 , who told @entity104 : " i appreciated this very much			1
i also sent a message of congratulations to @entity11 's [ vice-president ] mr @entity158			1
i found [ the decision ] a good thing to do			0
