-- visitors be warned : security around the @entity3 about to intensify			1
in the wake of last week 's unprecedented security breach , the @entity4 is planning to increase surveillance around @entity8			1
@entity4 director @entity9 has ordered a full review of friday 's incident			2
@entity12 , an @entity13 war veteran , is accused of carrying a small knife , scaling the @entity3 fence , sprinting roughly 70 yards across the @entity16 and making it pass the @entity19 doors , which were not locked			1
investigators said they later found more than 800 rounds of ammunition , plus two hatchets and a machete , in his car			2
here 's a look at four possible measures the @entity4 could implement to increase the security around what 's supposed to be the most fortified residence in the country : 1			1
increase the number of agents patrolling the grounds the uniformed division of the @entity4 -- the part of the agency responsible for patrolling the premises -- is immediately visible walking past the @entity3			1
they 're on the lawn , they 're on the roof , and most notably , they 're carrying some very intimidating rifles			0
@entity3 security was increased immediately after friday 's breach , but permanently adding more guards on the lawn and around the entrances would help prevent jumpers and make it easier to catch anyone who successfully jumps in the future			1
a federal law enforcement official tells @entity0 's @entity55 that this is a step the service plans to take , with officers patrolling the area in greater numbers and " looking for individuals who do not look like tourists			1
expand the barrier around the entrance creating an additional no - go zone around the fence separating the public from the @entity3 grounds is another possible option for the @entity4			1
despite the fence and the armed guards , the @entity70 is relatively accessible to the public			1
pedestrians can walk right up to the wrought - iron gate , and partial closures of the @entity16 -- because someone on the public side of the gate threw a bag or dropped something on the @entity3 side of the gate -- are common			0
earlier this year , a toddler even managed to squeeze through the gate			0
the approachability of the @entity3 is of course a major draw for visitors , and the optics of an additional perimeter could be problematic			0
" the @entity3 is still the people 's house , and we are long passed the days when anybody could walk up and get in , but the fact that anybody could walk so close to it -- i think makes an important and powerful statement in a democracy , " said @entity98 , director of the @entity99 at @entity100 , told @entity0			0
" keeping the @entity3 within public reach , if you will , sends an important political message , " said @entity98 , who specializes in presidential security			1
set up metal detectors around the premises this would be the most complicated and likely controversial security measure to implement			1
metal detectors are set up inside the gates that visitors must pass through to continue to the @entity3 , but nothing is on the outside of the gates			1
in addition to the optical problems , setting up this measure would bring about a lot of logistical questions : where exactly would they be ? which law enforcement agency would be responsible for staffing them ? which agency would pay for them ? this step is also the most unlikely ; law enforcement officials tell @entity0 that they wo n't be going up on @entity8 's pedestrian area			1
always lock the doors all of the details of friday 's breach are surprising , but perhaps the most shocking of all was that the @entity19 doors -- a large main entrance to the @entity3 -- were not locked			1
" they should lock the door , " @entity136 , author of " @entity137 " and outspoken critic of the @entity4 , said			0
" it 's just common sense			0
" the @entity144 entrances are frequently used , and that 's why they are not always locked , but the doors were not in use on friday at the time of the intrusion			2
@entity150 , @entity3 press secretary , told reporters on monday that going forward , those doors will be locked when not being used			2
tough time for the @entity4 friday 's breach is just the latest embarrassing incident for the @entity4			2
the agency has not had a great run of it in recent years -- from the prostitution scandal in @entity158 in 2012 , to the incident in the @entity160 earlier this year in which three agents were sent home for drinking			2
the attention on the @entity4 is counter to the entire purpose of the organization , @entity98 notes			0
" they would love to be secret			2
if you never see them , then they are doing their job , " @entity98 said			0
" if we are never talking about them , then they are doing their job the way that they want			0
the last thing that they want is for people to be discussing them			0
" president @entity181 reiterated his support for the agency that protects him on monday			0
" @entity184 does a great job			0
i am grateful for the sacrifices they make for me and my family , " he told reporters			0
@entity0 's @entity55 contributed reporting			0

secret service under criticism after an armed man was able to enter @entity19 doors
new security measures are being considered in wake of the breach
one measure could be increasing the number of agents patrolling the grounds
another one would be the *installation* of more security *cameras* outside the gates
