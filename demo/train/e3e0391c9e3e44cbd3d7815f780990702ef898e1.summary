-- @entity1 wakes up every day and goes to work with one mission : connecting people in her community with the @entity6 , so that in november they can be proud to cast a ballot for our candidates			2
@entity10 is the @entity12 regional director in @entity13			2
she 's been on the ground since september of last year , earlier than field staffers like her are usually hired			1
and she was n't alone			0
following the release of the @entity18 report -- a comprehensive post- 2012 election review i commissioned -- the @entity21 committed to building a permanent , year - round ground game			1
we immediately began locating and hiring field staff all across the country			1
@entity10 has the full support of the @entity21 and our resources			1
thanks to our multimillion - dollar investment in technology , and the private sector talent we 've brought on board , she has at her fingertips a suite of tools that allow her to identify voters we need to target in her community			1
the data she 's plugged into is the best in politics			1
we 've collected data from commercial and political organizations to make sure that we have the most current information needed to contact voters effectively			0
we 've invested in new predictive analytics that are revolutionizing how our campaigns understand what matters to each individual voter			0
not only are we making the data better , we are improving how other @entity6 can access our data and provide data back to us			0
our new voter relationship management tool , @entity56 , makes it easier for people to download and see the data			0
our new connecting tool , or application programming interface , allows other committees , candidates and vendors to receive our data automatically and send data back to us in real time			0
to ensure we recruit the best talent to develop the best tools , we launched a startup - style initiative within the @entity21 called @entity70 , and we opened a field office in @entity72			1
in addition to all these data resources , field staffers like @entity10 are given a communications playbook with media lists , information on important surrogates , suggested events to attend and messaging on key issues , as well as access to media training , research and social media help			1
this is n't just one person 's story			1
it 's the story of our field staffers across the country -- state directors , data directors , and @entity96 , black , and @entity98 - @entity97 engagement staffers			1
the @entity21 has also hired staff dedicated to engaging better with women , youth , people of faith and conservative allies and groups			1
we have hundreds of staff fanned out , especially in critical midterm states , supporting our candidates and growing our party			0
today , 91 % of our political staff is in the field			1
they support whole teams of precinct captains			0
we 've recruited more than 12,000 captains nationwide			0
those captains have teams of volunteers whose job it is to maintain lasting relationships with sets of people in their communities			0
they 're listening to their concerns and making sure they hear about the issues they care about			0
this is all done alongside our state parties and sister committees			0
that 's why we 've invested millions in our state parties to date			1
in addition to our on - the - ground work , we 're looking ahead and changing the 2016 presidential primary process so that we have better debates , handpicked moderators and an earlier convention			1
we have two overarching goals : holding a primary that is more informative and engaging for voters , and having a nominee who enters the general election in a position of strength			2
it 's been one year since i announced the first actions we 'd take in response to the @entity150			1
today , i can report that we 've fundamentally reshaped the way we do business			0
the power of our new tools and new strategy was on display last week , when we helped @entity157 win an important special election in @entity160 's 13th @entity159			1
that victory has @entity162 worried about november			2
of course , this is just a snapshot			0
and it 's also just the beginning			2
there 's much more ahead , including an ad campaign we 're launching this week -- a six - figure ad buy in 14 @entity170 target states			2
this campaign is about answering the question , " why should i be a @entity6 ? " people have told us that we need to better communicate what it is @entity6 stand for			0
but instead of the @entity21 telling people , we asked @entity6 to tell the @entity21 -- and the rest of the country -- what they stand for			1
why are they @entity6 ? and that 's what you 'll see in these ads. we hope this campaign will help us have that important and ongoing conversation			2
as for me , i 'm a @entity6 because i believe all @entity97 , regardless of where they come from , regardless of where they 're going , should have the chance to create their own @entity191			0
that 's a message we 're taking to every @entity97 , to every community			2
and thanks to the actions we 've taken in the last year , we 're better equipped than ever before to do that			2
we 're going to keep working to earn every voter 's trust , and we 're going keep fighting to earn every @entity97 's vote			2
we 're guided by the principle that no voter should be taken for granted ; no voter should be overlooked			0
because as the great @entity205 , former coach of my @entity206 , said , " the only place success comes before work is in the dictionary			0
" join us on @entity211 / @entity210			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 marks a year of changes at the @entity21
the @entity21 created a *continuous* ground game to put better tools in the field , he says
it 's changing how presidential primaries , debates will run
@entity214 says shift proved successful in @entity160 special election victory
