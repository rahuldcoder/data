@entity0 -- @entity2 is making some changes to its most well - known product : search			1
the tweaks , updates and beta projects are all part of @entity2 's attempt to make searches faster and more relevant			1
for starters , @entity2 is bringing its siri-esque voice search feature to the @entity14 and @entity15			1
the company expects to roll out an update to its free @entity19 app later this week with the new feature , which uses speech - recognition technology to understand spoken , natural language search requests			1
though it has not yet been approved , @entity2 said it is working with @entity23 to get the app out			1
depending on how you phrase your question or request , the app will bring up text answers and images or play @entity32 videos			2
the app also can give answers specific to your location , such as movie times or weather			2
for example , " play the sleepy kitten video " should automatically bring up and start playing a video of said exhausted feline , and " what 's the weather here next week ? " will show a weather report for that exact period			0
the version of this search - by - voice feature was already available for @entity49 4.1 users , and @entity2 says it will be available for older versions of @entity49 at some point in the future			1
there also are some subtle changes coming to @entity56 versions of the search engine around the world , starting thursday			1
auto - predict , the sometimes amusing feature that shows popular search terms that start with the words you are typing , will be joined by smarter , more relevant suggestions			1
the feature works by tapping the company 's knowledge graph , which is a database of more than 500 million " objects			0
" an object can be anything in the real world , such as a location , public figure , movie , sports team or company			0
for example , a search for " @entity78 " will suggest the @entity81 casino , the city and the original @entity84 temple in search field			0
another new feature is the knowledge carousel -- a collection of frequently mentioned results for certain search terms that will appear as a row of thumbnail images at the top of the screen			0
a search for famous astronauts will bring up images of relevant people , along with dates of birth and death			0
clicking on one of these links updates the page 's search results to show links about that person			0
it also works for other things such as locations , museums , animals or albums			0
the final feature announced wednesday is a beta project that loops your @entity117 account into the search results			1
when the feature is on , @entity2 will search the @entity121 as well as all the e-mails in your account and include a list of relevant e-mails or contacts on the side of your screen			1
for some common queries , @entity2 will parse the e-mails to isolate key bits of information , much like travel app @entity133			1
a search for " my flights " will pull flight information for upcoming trips you may have booked , and present it along with data from the @entity121 , like an updated flight status			0
the feature has been tested by several thousand @entity2 employees , and now the company is opening up the trial to a test group of a million			2
anyone can sign up to try the feature at g.co / searchtrial , although it will only work on the main @entity19 site in @entity56			0
these tweaks are the survivors of a huge number of experiments @entity2 has done for search			2
in 2011 , the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works			0
@entity2 says it has found more than 30 trillion unique urls on the @entity121 , crawls 20 billion sites a day and processes 100 billion searches every month			2
@entity165 , @entity2 's senior vice president of engineering , said the changes bring @entity2 one step closer to his dream of being like capt. @entity169 on " @entity170 " and using the starship computer to find out anything he needed to know			2
" the destiny of search is to become that ' @entity170 ' computer , " he said .			0

@entity2 is bringing @entity178 - like voice search features to its @entity15 and @entity14 app
search engine will now return suggestions for topics you are trying to search
a new @entity117 search tool is available as a beta project
