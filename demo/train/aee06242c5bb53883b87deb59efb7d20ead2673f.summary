@entity0 -- as the now - former presidential hopeful @entity3 moves to @entity4 , black conservatives say it 's time to stick with their @entity6 , and use the leverage that the @entity9 candidate gave them			1
" the movement should ... work actively , consistently , and thoroughly to bring the conservative message to new audiences with a firm grasp of the issues , " conservative commentator @entity10 said			2
but @entity3 's rise in the polls -- strong enough to have been taken seriously as a legitimate candidate â € ” seems as unlikely as the rise of a young , black conservative @entity9 movement			1
both seem an anomaly , especially among the @entity25 - @entity24 community			0
" it can be rough out there being a black conservative , particularly in @entity0 and @entity32 , " said @entity26 , who runs the blog @entity28			2
" we 're angry , we 're frustrated and we want to do something about it			0
" @entity36 said the @entity9 is fast becoming an alternative for @entity25 disproportionately affected by the failing economy			0
" what we believe is to vote @entity41 out of office , " she said			0
black conservatives say high profile @entity9 candidates like @entity3 and @entity45 , who once headed the @entity46 , have helped their visibility and recruitment efforts			1
" more people have come out of the closet as black republicans , " @entity10 said			0
but all agree , there is no collective voice among black conservatives , and @entity3 certainly did n't enjoy all of their support			1
" ... even prior to the allegations , all of the opportunities where he misspoke and contradicted himself on different things , " @entity10 said of @entity3 's announcement to suspend his campaign today			1
" a stronger campaign would have done a lot more for black conservatism			0
so there are definitely some out there who feel a little betrayed and feel a sense of disappointment , and a lost opportunity as well , " he adds			0
earlier this week , another @entity74 darling -- and one of two black congressmen -- rep. @entity77 ( @entity78 ) called for @entity3 to step down , saying on @entity80 's morning radio show , " ... he probably needs to understand that he 's a distracter for what 's going on right now and we should move on			1
" but @entity3 's legacy is n't lost on those who say they were happy to see a face like theirs in the race and with a message closely aligned with what they believe			2
" there were probably many black conservatives who were n't sure if the tea party movement were accepting of them , but @entity3 proved that they were , " says @entity93 , publisher of the @entity94 , which caters to urban republican and libertarian voters of color			1
@entity93 , whose site has had nearly a million views since its launch in 2004 , says , " i think the best thing that @entity3 has done for the black [ conservative movement ] ... and this is one thing that no one can take away from him -- is that @entity3 has shown that a black conservative in the future can actually rise through the @entity9 primary to become president of the @entity24 , if he 's very strategic			1
" even though @entity3 's strategy failed to keep him in the race for the @entity9 nomination , it succeeded in adding his voice to the political dialogue within the diverse landscape of conservative @entity25 - @entity24 voters			1
" just because my parents vote @entity125 party , why am i really voting for them ? " said @entity36 , whose mission is to encourage more black voters to examine candidates rather than vote emotionally			2
she thinks the @entity9 's policy stances on education , family values and tax rates for entrepreneurs will attract many among the young and college educated			0
" the pulse of black conservatism rests primarily with its younger generation , " said @entity93 , adding that they have been " watching curiously , via blogs , @entity134 and @entity135 , but who for the most part are n't huge fans of any of the current candidates			0
" so what gains can those pushing the conservative black movement make going forward ? " i think black @entity9 understand that you have to be within the system to make changes to the system , where there needs to be changes made to the system , " @entity10 said			2
but , for now @entity3 says , " we will change it from the outside			0

some young black conservatives view @entity3 's *downfall* with mixed feelings
his many *mistakes* , they say , hurt their cause
but his early success and tea party support show the movement could embrace a black conservative
