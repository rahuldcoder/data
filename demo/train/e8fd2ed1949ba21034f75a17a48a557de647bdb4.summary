-- like many of @entity5 's victims , @entity2 coach @entity1 was caught in a web of despair			1
as @entity9 headed home the winning goal in @entity14 's 2 - 0 @entity13 triumph , the forward pulled on a @entity5 mask and celebrated wildly			1
it was no less than @entity14 deserved -- victory at its home stadium in the traditional curtain raiser before the @entity22 @entity21 season against an arch rival is not to be dismissed lightly			2
@entity25 's first half effort gave @entity14 the advantage on 23 minutes before @entity9 sealed the triumph by converting @entity29 's cross			1
" we played very well at the back , " @entity14 coach @entity30 told reporters			2
" the @entity34 did not have a lot of chances and we defended superbly			0
the engine is gradually starting to work well but we are still not at 100 %			0
" while neither coach will read too much into the result given the number of absentees , particularly in the @entity2 squad , the victory was particularly sweet for @entity14			1
if @entity9 was cast as the superhero , then @entity2 arrived in town as the arch villain			1
@entity2 , which has made a habit of plundering the @entity14 talent in recent seasons with the acquisitions of @entity51 and @entity52 , raced to last season 's league title			1
add to that a number of off - field spats , including @entity2 's @entity59 's ill - judged chanting which went viral , for which he subsequently apologized , and it 's easy to see why these two clubs just do n't get on			2
@entity2 , favorites for the title once again this year , boasts one of the most talented squads in world football with @entity67 and @entity68 joining the @entity71 's @entity70 winners in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
but its coach @entity1 is under pressure -- a pressure which has been mounting since his side was brutally dumped out of last season 's @entity80 by @entity82			0
when @entity2 defeated @entity14 in the 2013 @entity80 final at @entity85 on their way to the treble under @entity88 , it appeared the club was set for a new era of domination			1
but @entity2 failed to retain its @entity93 title last year and its form dropped off in alarming fashion after ensuring another @entity21 success			2
@entity1 's side will begin its title defense with a home fixture against @entity102 on friday august 22 and according to @entity74 , a second half substitute , there is much work to be done			0
" many of us only recently returned to training and we also have some players injured , " he told @entity22 television			0
" it was not easy			0
we did not have that many chances but we are still in the middle of our preseason preparations			0
" meanwhile , @entity114 announced that he will be concentrating solely on club football after retiring from international duty			2
@entity68 , who won 81 caps and scored 16 international goals after making his debut for @entity121 in 2006 , missed the recent @entity70 through injury			1
" i am stopping , " the 31 - year - old told @entity22 magazine kicker			0
" i realized that this moment has come			0
" one has to know when to stop			0
i have experienced so much and now is the time for others to come forward			0
" you could see at the @entity70 that we should have no concerns about @entity121 's future			1
