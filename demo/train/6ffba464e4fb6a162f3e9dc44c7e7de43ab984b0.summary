-- with its $ 315 million purchase of @entity4 this week , a company best known for distributing free @entity2 has succeeded where mainstream media outlets failed : spotting the potential of one of the @entity9 's fastest growing media brands			1
@entity10 , widely thought to be the imminent victim of a dying @entity13 dial - up business , now owns a property that may help define the future of news			1
how big is the @entity4 , exactly ? a recent report from @entity18 put the upstart media company just behind the @entity20 in terms of web traffic -- and set to overtake @entity20			1
the @entity20 started in 1851 ; the @entity4 began in 2005			1
perhaps it 's the @entity4 's relative youth that 's stimulated such derision among media executives			2
rapidly changing markets are easily dismissed as fads until it 's too late			0
is it pride , perhaps , that 's prevented many of the leading media brands from experimenting with aggregation , populist content and a blogging community that may at times appear amateurish ? is it a fear of the unknown , or of irreparably damaging a brand built up over decades ( and in some cases , more than a century ) ? or a compulsion to serve up the news we need to know , rather than the news we want ? perhaps it 's simply that the news media , comforted for years by the defensibility of its distribution channels -- ordinary citizens could n't afford a printing press or start a television channel -- has been slow to mobilize in response to the threat of a million niche blogs and thousands of new ways to discover , parse , aggregate and reorganize the news			2
whatever the cause , the market has spoken			0
the @entity4 and rivals like @entity59 are racking up the page views as older -- and supposedly wiser -- brands find this rapid growth evasive			2
but the signal is clear and startling			0
a $ 315 million web property is no longer a blog			1
it 's a fully fledged modern media company			0
the effect , i think , will be to shock the news media into action			0
not only will we see a rapid consolidation of the industry as the old guard seeks to buy or merge its way into this emergent online market ( see also : the @entity79 merger ) , but we 'll see increased investment in those upstarts that choose to go it alone			0
most of all , i hope we 'll see a news industry more willing to embrace risk , experimentation and occasional failures -- or face losing the war to a former dial - up provider with nothing to lose and everything to gain			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity93 .			0

@entity10 's $ 315 million purchase of the @entity4 is a bold *bet* on the @entity9 's potential
once thought to be a dying dial - up business , @entity10 now may help define the future of news
@entity4 is just behind the @entity20 in terms of web traffic
