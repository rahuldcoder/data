-- it started because @entity2 gave someone a ride home			1
when the actor was given the script for " drive , " he was also given the option to choose the director			1
" whether i did it or not depended on who was going to direct it , " @entity2 said			1
having seen the films of @entity15 ( " @entity16 , " " @entity17 " ) , he thought the @entity19 director might be the right guy			1
but then they had an " awful meeting , " probably because @entity15 had the flu , and @entity2 wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible			1
one catch : @entity15 could n't drive and needed a lift			1
" on the ride home , we were just playing music and driving , " @entity2 said from a @entity27 hotel suite with his director nearby , eating his lunch of soup and hard - boiled eggs			1
looking back at that meeting , he said , they had " an epiphany " when the @entity40 song " @entity38 " came on the radio and @entity2 started singing along			1
" i think we both saw the movie in that moment			2
conversation was n't really part of that moment			0
it was n't based on ideas			0
it was based on this experience , this quick experience			0
it was only 10 minutes in the car , but it was a feeling that was a relatable experience , and we thought , ' why not make a movie about driving that 's really about driving ? not stunts ? ' it came to us in a flash , and we both had that as a benchmark			1
" " drive " was the first time @entity2 got to pick a director for one of his movies and take charge			1
it was the first time since 2002 's " @entity66 " that he 'd made a " really violent film , a gory film			2
" it sparked a daredevil streak in his career , which is reaching a new height ( or low , according to some critics ) with his latest @entity15 collaboration			1
the controversial and ultraviolent " @entity79 " features a lot of limbs and other body parts getting lopped off , drenched in blood and red light			1
one act of violence begets another in an elliptical and relentless revenge cycle that includes a man sticking his hand inside a dead woman 's body , perhaps to reclaim her womb			0
but for @entity2 , it was one way to put an end to any idea that he was just a @entity92 heartthrob ( or sexy internet meme ) , his pretty - boy face as bruised and beaten up as possible on the film 's poster , a trademark of @entity15 's			1
@entity2 's career , which started as on the " @entity99 " ( along with @entity99 @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 ) , gained traction in 2004 with the tearjerker romance " @entity106 , " which won him such accolades as @entity108 at the @entity108			1
see more kid stars all grown up but it was n't until " @entity111 " in 2006 ( which got him an @entity114 nomination ) and " @entity115 " in 2007 ( which got him his first @entity117 nomination ) that he was taken seriously by the critics			0
he could have had his pick of projects , but instead he took a break for a few years , until he found a handful of films by auteur - type directors that would break convention and would mean something to him : " @entity129 , " with director @entity127 ( with whom he reteamed on this year 's " @entity128 " ) , and " drive			1
" @entity15 , like @entity2 , was placed in a prime position to do " more of a @entity92 film " after the critical acclaim and commercial success of " drive			1
" he chose not to			0
" i admire that , " @entity2 said			2
" he makes films for personal reasons , and that was an experience i wanted to have , to keep having			0
" when he worked with a revolving door of directors on @entity92 films , @entity2 said , it was n't satisfying			2
" i just feel , after a while , like it 's serial dating , " he said			0
" and at a certain point , you want to settle down and see what 's really there			0
it takes more than one film to do that , because you waste a lot of time on a film getting to know somebody , being polite , getting to see how the other person works			0
it 's nice to have a history with someone , so you can keep in touch with each other , so you can trust what they 're saying to you			2
" @entity2 knew that " @entity79 " would be a " difficult film " that would " divide people " ( and divide them it has ; the festival audience booed the film at @entity175 )			1
still , he plunged into it headfirst , even though , he admitted , he did n't know what it was			0
" @entity179 makes his movies chronologically , " he said			0
" you find it while you 're making it			0
you have to just follow your intuition , and there 's really no other experience making a film quite like that			2
it 's like taking a drug			0
you go on a trip			0
" since his job was to have the same deadpan expression no matter what happened , @entity2 calls " @entity79 " " basically a silent film			1
" " we 're so accustomed to words , " @entity15 said			1
" turning down the sound on a television is an alien concept			0
" with little conversation between them , the characters become ciphers , inscrutable ( save for @entity204 as @entity2 's psycho of a mother , who has a lot to say , often in the crudest terms possible )			1
without words , most of the communication is physical and symbolic			0
@entity2 holds out his hands , either to examine them , to reach for a prostitute he wants to pretend is his girlfriend or to punch the cop who killed his brother			2
he leaves the amputations to other characters , but @entity2 is n't tentative about violence onscreen			2
( he counts " @entity220 " and " @entity221 " as some of his childhood favorites			0
) some critics objected to the lack of dialogue , lack of character motivation and style over substance in " @entity79 , " but @entity15 enjoys the criticism			1
" if everyone loves it , we 're not different , " he said			2
" how can we all love and hate the same things ? if people love it for the exact same reason other people hate it , it penetrates			0
your penetration has been successful			0
" and it 's this lesson that @entity2 has absorbed for his first film as a director , " how to catch a monster , " which he 's currently editing			1
on the set of that film , which includes his " drive " co-star @entity248 , he practiced the most peaceful , nonviolent thing he ever saw @entity15 do : listen to his own instincts first but listen to everyone else involved in the project as well			1
" there was a guy auditioning for a stunt role , like @entity257 15 , who gets his head chopped off , " @entity2 said			2
" @entity179 talked to him for like two hours : what he thought of the story , what he thought about the film			0
he just really engages everybody and collects their ideas , and i think it 's a really smart way to work			0
all these people come to you with an entire history and they can offer a perspective to what you 're doing , whether you like it or not			0
it seems strange now to work in a situation where people are closed off to everything but their own ideas			0
" sounds like @entity2 wo n't be going back to that anytime soon .			2
