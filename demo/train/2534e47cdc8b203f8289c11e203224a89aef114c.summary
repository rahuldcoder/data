-- @entity1 made history by becoming the first female jockey to win the $ 2 million @entity4 friday -- then she dropped the real bombshell by revealing she was seven weeks pregnant and would retire after racing again on saturday			1
the 26 - year - old guided the three - year - old fillie , @entity8 , to a one and a quarter length victory over its closest rival at the prestigious event in @entity13 , @entity14			1
she then took to the podium to reveal the baby news in front of her stunned mother , who she had still to inform of her pregnancy at this point , and a live television audience			0
" was n't planning to announce until after i finish riding tomorrow but winning the @entity22 on @entity23 was just too special , " @entity1 later tweeted			1
" looking forward to 4 live mounts tomorrow ( saturday ) and making my retirement even more special by going out with a bang , " she later added			1
a two time winner of the @entity28 and the @entity29 in 2012 , @entity1 is married to @entity30 who is a racehorse trainer himself			1
she is currently the sixth highest earning jockey on the @entity33 circuit , winning more than $ 13 million of prize money in 2014 alone			1
in the past she has spoken about the challenges female jockeys face compared to their male counterparts			2
" for a female jockey it 's a little bit harder to get yourself established			2
but once you can get over that hump and prove that you 're a competitive rider , and win races , it 's irrelevant what gender you are , " she told @entity0 in 2013			0
" to be honest , the female aspect has worked to my advantage in a lot of respects -- just with publicity and being recognized for things that i 've accomplished which may not have been such a big deal if it was just another male jockey			2
" but perhaps the racing world should n't be too surprised @entity56 has decided to chose motherhood over the saddle			0
she revealed in the run - up to last year 's @entity61 that she planned to start a family before long			0
" there 's still a lot of things that i want to accomplish in my career so i 'm going to try and get all of that out of the way first -- my husband and i are very excited about having a family , " she said at the time			0
that said , there can be hardly anyone who expected the announcement so abruptly after a historic triumph .			0
