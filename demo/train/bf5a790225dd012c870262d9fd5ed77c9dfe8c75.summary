@entity25 later returned to @entity27 , married and had nine children , one of whom was @entity2 's father , @entity40			0

the stories must have been convincing			0
the eldest of his nine children , also named @entity10 , moved north to @entity11 in 1951			0
@entity47 , @entity2 's father , later joined his older brother in @entity12			0

between 1940 and 1970 , more than 5 million african - americans left the @entity50 , migrating to cities like @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 ; @entity58 , @entity12 , and @entity59			1
" you have this incredible movement of black people across the width and breadth of this land and [ they ] establish themselves as a national presence , rather than a regional one [ based ] in the @entity50 , " @entity36 said			1
interactive : explore the @entity20 - @entity19 journey that movement of african - americans -- called " the @entity71 " -- had a clear and direct impact on the country			1
" it made race a national issue , " said @entity74 , author of " @entity75 : the @entity79 and how it changed @entity80			0
" " you could say it was always a national issue and have a very powerful case ... but it was possible to say , ' it 's a @entity87 issue , ' " he said			0
" after the @entity71 , it was no longer possible			0
" african - american culture was interacting with other cultures across the whole of @entity19 society , @entity74 said , " affecting everything from government policy and music to sports and everything in between			1
" the return south civil rights legislation passed during the 1960s helped set the stage for the next era of @entity19 migration : a return to the @entity50			1
around 1970 , many african - americans began moving back to the @entity50 , historians and demographers say			1
the trend accelerated during the 1990s and this decade , according to @entity109 , a demographer at the @entity110 , a @entity112 - based think - tank			2
from 1965 through 1970 , the @entity50 experienced a net migration loss -- the number of people who moved into the region compared to the number of people who moved out -- of more than 287,000 african - americans			1

the numbers of african - americans returning to the @entity50 are not as large as those seen during the @entity71 , but the trend has resonance because of the place the region occupies in black history and mythology			1
the ascendance of the @entity87 's economy was a key factor behind the return migration , @entity109 said			1
" i think there 's a push and a pull involved with the movement , " he said			0
" a lot of it had to do with the decline of heavy industry , which employed a lot of blacks and blue - collar whites , in a whole set of @entity156 states , " he said			1
meanwhile , states like @entity24 , @entity158 , @entity159 , and increasingly the @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 were booming , @entity109 said			2
civil rights legislation and a more educated society made the @entity50 more tolerant and hospitable			1
the booming economy provided jobs and opportunity			0
but there is also an emotional element for many african - americans when it comes to the region			1
" i think a big part , aside from the economy , is the kind of historic roots that blacks have had there , " @entity109 said			0
" there is something culturally attractive about the @entity50 to the @entity20 - @entity19 population even though they spent many decades surviving brutal treatment during the @entity185 period and a lot of the racial discrimination that occurred			1
" @entity36 , the historian , said many people , especially retirees , made decisions to return out of a desire to connect with ancestral homes , churches and communities			0
@entity2 's parents still live in @entity11 , though they spend the winters in the @entity50			2
her uncle , @entity25 , moved to @entity23 , the place of his father 's birth , in 1998			0
when asked for the reasons behind her uncle 's move , @entity2 said it was a love of the land , the slower pace and something almost " mysterious			0
" " they wanted to get out of the @entity50 , but it still calls them , " she said of her family 's journey during the past few decades			2
there 's " something about the land and it just calls them back like a song			0
