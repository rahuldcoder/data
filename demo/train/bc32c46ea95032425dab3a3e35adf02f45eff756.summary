@entity0 -- when @entity4 citizen @entity3 decided to flee to @entity0 because of its " spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent , " he may not have anticipated that some in the city would launch a protest backing him			1
several hundred demonstrators took to @entity0 's streets in the rain saturday voicing support for @entity3 a week after the 29 - year - old computer technician , who is believed to be hiding out somewhere in the city , revealed himself as the source of leaked documents exposing an international surveillance program of internet and telephone communications operated by the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
the revelation of his presence -- as well as his claims that @entity0 had been subject to the surveillance -- has sparked heated speculation whether @entity0 , a special administrative region -- one that is semi-autonomous -- of the @entity33 , would prove to be a safe haven for him			1
@entity3 said his intention was to " ask the courts and people of @entity0 to decide my fate			1
" " we 're rallying in order not to disappoint him and to ask @entity0 to protect his well - being , not to extradite him , and to uphold @entity0 law , " said blogger , activist and protest organizer @entity40			0
amid the blowing of whistles and chants of " @entity52 ! " and " @entity24 has no say ! " the protest brought together representatives from 27 civil rights , labor rights , and left - wing democratic groups , as well as many ordinary members of the public as well as media			0
under the drizzling sky , protesters determined to show their support held laminated placards and umbrellas painted with slogans			0
@entity69 and @entity70 , students from the @entity67 who are studying abroad in @entity0 , said they found the protest " really refreshing			0
" " as @entity4 , it 's kind of disheartening to know [ the surveillance program ] is going on behind our backs and we do n't have a say in it , " said @entity69			2
" it 's empowering to see people who are n't necessarily @entity4 fighting for something they feel is a universal human right			2
" @entity82 brought her daughters , @entity84 , aged eight , and three - year - old @entity85 , along to the protest ; the children held cut - out masks on sticks bearing @entity3 's image			2
" it 's not just about our generation , but the next generation as well , " @entity82 said			0
@entity84 echoed her mother 's sentiment : " when i grow up , i can tell my children about this			0
" organizers claimed an overall turnout of 900 protesters ; police said the demonstration had a peak turnout of 300 -- a relatively small showing compared to major protests in @entity0 , which have attracted hundreds of thousands of people			2
@entity40 said plans for the protest only began on monday , and that he would be pleased if 1,000 people turned out in the end			0
the three - hour protest , which kicked off in a garden in the city 's business district and went on to the @entity4 consulate and the @entity0 government headquarters , failed to gain a strong sense of momentum , hampered in part by the narrow looping route allocated by the city 's authorities			1
at each rallying point , only a small group was able to gather around to hear the keynote speakers ; most protesters were relegated to standing single or double file some distance away			0
by the time the protest moved outside the government headquarters to deliver an open letter to the city 's leader , chief executive @entity130 , the crowd had dropped to about 100 people			0
@entity3 's arrival in the city has heightened simmering fears about the ever - encroaching hand of @entity137 in the city 's affairs and freedoms			1
while @entity0 has its own de facto constitution , judiciary , and legal system under the " one country two systems " policy , a deep mistrust runs in the city toward the government under @entity130 , who is widely viewed as being under the thumb of the @entity33 central government			0
in a televised interview with @entity153 wednesday , @entity130 repeatedly insisted he " does not comment on individual cases , " when asked how @entity0 would handle @entity3 's case			1
his stonewalling infuriated many hong kongers			0
" judging from [ this interview ] , i think he 's waiting for instructions from @entity137 , " said @entity158 , a blogger and activist with in - media , the civil advocacy group that organized the protest with @entity40			2
according to @entity0 law , if the @entity4 was to request the city to surrender @entity3 , @entity137 could step in only if its defence or foreign affairs would be significantly affected by @entity0 's actions			1
@entity137 is not allowed to interfere with any asylum proceedings			0
nevertheless , many have expressed fears that @entity137 will quietly influence @entity0 's handling of @entity3 's case			1
" @entity0 's decisions are all based on the @entity33 government , " said @entity174 , 24 , a graduate student at @entity175			1
" i do n't think @entity0 can help @entity3 , " she added , although she said it was important to show her support at the protest			1
others also note that @entity0 has a track record of cooperating with the @entity4			1
in particular , they fear @entity0 will not respect due process in the @entity3 case , instead enabling him to be quietly whisked away			1
local media in @entity0 last year reported on the case of a @entity188 dissident who launched legal action against the city 's government , accusing them of aiding in his " extraordinary rendition " and subsequent torture in prison			2
" the biggest @entity197 government -- the @entity4 government -- is his enemy			0
now he can only count on us , the power of @entity0 civil society and our legal system , " @entity199 of in - media told protesters			2
" i see this incident as a stress test for @entity0 society and its legal system			0
" @entity210 , a member of the @entity0 legislature who addressed the protesters , said the city of @entity0 " owes @entity3 at least some response			1
" " the @entity4 is supposed to be the champion of democracy , but it 's been conducting blanket surveillance on a global scale , " she said			2
" if the guy at the top has access to all our lines of communication , how is ... anyone ever going to start a revolution ? "			0
