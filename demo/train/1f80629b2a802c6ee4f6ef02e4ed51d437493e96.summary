at the other end , @entity1 goalkeeper @entity53 had to be alert to make a smart save from @entity2 defender @entity56 's header			1
@entity43 brought on midfielder @entity57 at the start of the second period to offer an aerial threat going forward and the tactic almost paid immediate dividends			2

@entity2 , themselves seeking points as they attempt to move away from the relegation area , pressed forward in search of an equalizer but were caught on the break in injury time			1
