-- it was barely floating , perhaps minutes from sinking , a small skiff , washed up against an unforgiving cement breakwater			2
the flat - bottomed boat was homemade , cobbled together with no evident craftsmanship , from scarce and salvaged materials			2
it was about 14 feet long and 4 feet wide , with a hand - hewn pole for a mast and fallen sails that looked like burlap			2
as waves and a relentless tide drove it into the concrete wall , the boat was going under , surrendering to the ocean that had brought it to @entity20 , @entity21			2
a small crowd had gathered			2
my wife and i asked what was happening			2
one in the group told us that some men came over from @entity30 in this boat the previous night			2
they had given themselves to the ocean and whatever fate their desperate journey might bring them			0
they had traveled nearly 200 miles , day and night , through rough and open waters , sailing this pitiful craft on pitiless seas			0
local security had found them , walking around , lost			0
they had no destination beyond @entity45			1
they were picked up and turned over to @entity47			0
we asked how many there were			0
someone in the group told us , " nine men risked their lives to come to the @entity54 on this			1
" what is exceptional about this story is that it is not exceptional			0
immigrants constantly risk not only their own lives , but also their children 's , for the economic opportunity we enjoy with indifference			1
while these men apparently were from @entity30 , covered by the decades - old " wet - foot - dry - foot " @entity30 immigration policy , a trickle of immigrants from @entity45 has suddenly become a flood of women and children , swamping our border security offices			1
tens of thousands of @entity73 and @entity74 have been drawn by the luster of an @entity54 economy we find tarnished			1
unlike those nine @entity30 men , however , these immigrants have an additional reason for coming : president @entity81 invited them here			1
as @entity85 explained in the @entity86 , " president @entity81 's @entity83 decree -- @entity83 , which allowed thousands of illegal immigrants to stay in this country if they came at a young age -- created , in effect , a magnet for young people to try to enter the @entity54 illegally			1
" this degree , announced in june 2012 , allows immigrant children to stay if they had been in the @entity54 continuously from june 2007 to june 2012			1
some say , however , the decree has swept through @entity45			1
according to the @entity101 , a recent leaked memo by @entity100 agents spoke of this wave of new immigrants , saying they were motivated to come now , in this surge , because they had heard of the change in @entity54 policy that would allow them to remain in @entity45			1
@entity83 must have sounded like popular politics to this president , yet it was cruelty disguised as kindness			0
our president 's incompetence has created a humanitarian crisis : he has lured an endless stream of children and mothers to risk everything to travel here			1
we are a country divided today			1
the prevailing debate is what is wrong with @entity45 and who among us should be blamed for it			1
yesterday 's newcomers blame today 's arrivals			1
those who have already walked through the golden door of opportunity would ungenerously close it behind them			0
we confront each other over what we lack , forgetting the greatness we have built together and how much better we could still be			0
@entity136 demand too much of immigration reform			0
the stalemate serves both their political ambitions			0
and as we watch men risking their lives on what can barely be called a boat and children desperately throwing themselves across our borders , we harbor a shame : no immigration reform will pass @entity149 this year			0
perhaps both @entity136 and @entity138 should remember : once , many of our families , in either this or a previous incarnation , came here as immigrants , seeking a better life and freedom			1
imagine that you are one of the nine men on that boat			0
or a muddied child in the @entity161			0
we may never be called upon to make those journeys , but what would each of us risk to live in the greatest country in human history ? much more , it appears , than our leaders would risk so we can keep living there			0
join us on @entity170 / @entity169 .			0

@entity172 says a new wave of young immigrants were practically invited by @entity81
he says a recent change in @entity54 policy allows them to remain in @entity45
