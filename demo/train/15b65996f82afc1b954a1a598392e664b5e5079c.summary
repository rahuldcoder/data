-- not long ago i received a complaint from a co-worker that i had used the f - word in a tweet			1
i was quoting a lyric from the band @entity7 : " who gives a f --- about an @entity11 comma ? " my answer was , of course , " i do			0
" the full quote , without the fig leaf , appears in my book " the @entity17			0
" i come by my f - wordiness honestly			1
my grandmother used it easily and could swear in three languages			0
my mother -- at the age of 94 -- drops an f - bomb in every telephone conversation			1
during a trivia game at her assisted living home , she could not think of the name of @entity30 's magic dragon , so she blurted : " f --- the @entity31 , " which now has become the family 's official title for the song			1
the f - word is almost everywhere			1
while still not fit for polite society , it no longer carries the depth of taboo attributed to it in 1978 by that hero of foul mouthery @entity42 , who said in a comic monologue : " the big one , the word f --- , that 's the one that hangs them up the most			1
" its common usage in popular culture today may have transformed it into one of the most versatile words in @entity54			1
it might qualify as the word of the new century			2
but is that a good thing ? setting records on screen the recent opening of the @entity62 film " @entity63 of @entity64 " has inspired critical and popular complaints about its excesses , including its language			2
i have not yet seen the film , but am grateful to the dirty word counters , who have recorded a total of 506 uses of the f - word in the three - hour movie			1
@entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and various other sources cite this as a record for a non-documentary film , beating @entity84 's " @entity83 " ( 435 ) , and two earlier @entity62 projects : " casino " ( 422 ) and " @entity87 " ( 300 )			2
versions of the f - word appear so often in " @entity90 " that an accurate count might be impossible			1
@entity93 's total comes in at 544			2
( i hope i do n't see a @entity95 report contesting these numbers			0
) ( " @entity83 " appears to keep the record for most fpm : f - words per minute , at 3.1			1
" @entity90 " does beat " casino " on this metric			0
in his mischievous book of lists , @entity101 calculates that a viewer of " casino " will hear the f - word on the average of 2.4 times per minute			1
for " @entity90 " it 's 2.8 times			1
) how things have changed			0
i remember with surprising clarity the first time i used the f - word			1
one of the @entity114 brothers told me a joke , and he thought it was so funny i ran home to tell my mother			0
she did n't laugh and made me repeat it to my father			0
it was 1956 or so			0
i was , maybe , 8 years old			0
things did not go well			0
i went to work with my dad one day , a @entity128 officer on one of the @entity131 piers			0
a group of men stood inside , including some rough - looking longshoremen , who dropped the f - word loudly and often into their gritty conversation			1
several men , alerting them to my presence , told them to stick a cork in it			0
even in their gruffness , they looked sheepish and apologetic			0
first encounters i remember exactly where i was standing the first time i heard a girl my age use the f - word			1
it was 1967 and i was a sophomore in college			0
she sat on the ground , a hippie chick , smoking and grousing about her inability to score tickets for the @entity155			0
and i know exactly where i first encountered the f - word in print			1
i was a freshman in high school , and the book was called " @entity160 , " a work on many lists of the most often banned books			0
@entity164 uses the word five times in " catcher " with great power and specificity			1
i still own the book where i underlined each use of the word			2
i remember the teachers who tried to convince me that the main problem with the f - word was not its power to offend , but the evidence it gave of your limited vocabulary			1
i blew that criticism off back then , but i 'm beginning to think they were on to something			0
not that the f - word is n't an amazingly versatile piece of our four - letter @entity187 heritage			1
it can express surprise , outrage , anger , humor , delight or desire			0
and it can stand in for several parts of speech : noun , verb ( in any tense ) , gerund , participle , imperative , interrogative , interjection , to mention just the most common uses			0
it can be used with other little prepositional helpers			0
you can f --- with someone 's mind			2
you can be too f --- ed up to walk			0
you can get f --- ed over by the @entity213			0
a rare language form let 's not forget use of the f - word as one of the rarest of language forms , the infix			1
a prefix comes before a word			2
an infix appears in the middle of a normal word or phrase , as in " you are damn f --- ing right			2
" or " un-f --- ing - believable			2
" or as they like to moan in @entity232 when thinking of the @entity234 victory in the 1978 playoff game : " @entity236 --- ing @entity237 ! " it was the light - hitting @entity237 's timely home run that ruined the @entity240 season			1
all this and more is chronicled in the recent 270 - page lexicon titled " @entity243 , " by @entity244 , editor at large of the @entity246			2
perhaps the ultimate expression of the f - word 's versatility comes in a famous scene from @entity255 's @entity254 series " @entity256 " in which two detectives explore a crime scene			1
the scene takes less than four minutes , during which the cops use versions of the f - word , by my count , 34 times			1
it is the only word used in the scene			2
as they look at crime scene photos of naked and murdered women , the word expresses disgust			2
as they examine the conflicting evidence , the word describes frustration			2
as they begin to piece things together , it describes mounting excitement			0
when they find a key piece of evidence , it is a word of celebration			2
offensive from the beginning the f - word has a long history , and , unlike some other taboo words , seems to have been offensive from the start			1
just as newspapers and this website put a veil over the word by eliminating some letters , the earliest known version of the word in @entity54 was written in code			1
according to the @entity300 , an @entity54 poem dated about 1500 makes fun of clerics who do n't keep their vows , including a line that translates : " they are not in heaven because they f --- wives of @entity309 " ( a town near @entity311 )			1
in the text , the f - word appears in the form of a letter substitution code			1
though still considered vulgar slang , the f - word is more prevalent than ever , and is often cited as evidence of the coarsening of our culture			1
the publisher of " @entity323 " asked @entity324 to substitute " fug " in 1947			0
six decades later , the f - word is a staple in hip - hop music , stand - up comedy routines , locker room harangues , pornographic repartee , and any movie or cable television series that tries to portray gritty , realistic dialogue			1
cops use it , thugs use it , even grads with @entity340 use it			0
i am making the case that , given its ubiquity and versatility , the " f - word " is one of the most important words of the 21st century , which is why we should pay close attention to how it can be used well			1
in previous essays on language , i have offered these justifications for dropping the occasional f - bomb : 1			1
as an authentic expression of realistic human speech			0
as a single , shocking , almost - out - of context blow to the solar plexus			2
as a neutralizer to the poison of piety , fastidiousness and erudition			0
as a way of defining character			0
none other than @entity368 , the influential style czar of the @entity370 , once published this opinion : " there is not ... a single transitive verb in respectable or even in scientific language that expresses the idea of the slang verb f ---			2
" using and overusing the f - word perhaps the most moving use of the f - word i ever encountered came in the documentary 9/11 by two @entity383 brothers , who were telling the story of a firehouse in @entity131			1
during the filming , two jetliners flew into the @entity388 , changing the way @entity390 look at the world			0
even though the show ran on commercial television , we were given a chance to hear , uncensored , the rough emotional language of a fraternity of brave men facing their greatest challenge			2
there is a numbing quality to overuse of the f - word			1
shock and stark realism can be created without it			0
you wo n't find it in the novel " @entity410 , " or the recent film version , which , like " @entity90 , " stars @entity412			0
i do n't remember hearing it in a @entity417 monologue			0
i like it best when it is used rarely and in a perfect context , as when it comes out of the mouth of the character @entity422 , the high school chemistry teacher who becomes the drug lord of " @entity424			0
" when he first utters it in rage and frustration at a moment of great pain , it has as much power as a gun blast			0
it works best when delivered at just the right dramatic moment			0
to keep up with the @entity62 rate , the characters in " @entity424 " would have to utter the f - word about 140 times -- in each 47 - minute episode			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity443 .			1

@entity443 notes that " @entity447 " uses f - word hundreds of times
he says the word has become more *acceptable* , though still not fit for polite society
the f - word is one of the most versatile words in the @entity54 language , he says
@entity443 : there 's a numbing quality to overuse of the f - word
