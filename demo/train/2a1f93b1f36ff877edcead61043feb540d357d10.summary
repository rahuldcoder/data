@entity0 -- confronted with recent polling suggesting rising gas prices may already be damaging president @entity6 's political standing ahead of the summer driving season , the president on thursday reiterated the case that neither he , nor any other politician , has the power to bring down prices in the short term			1
" we are starting to see a lot of politicians talking a lot and not doing much , " @entity6 told an enthusiastic crowd at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
" we 've seen this movie before			0
" " every time prices start to go up , especially in an election year , politicians dust off their three point plan for $ 2.00 , " the president continued , deviating from prepared remarks the @entity23 had distributed to reporters before the speech			2
" i guess this year they decided they were going to make it $ 2.50			2
" that was a direct reference to former house speaker @entity34 , who has pledged of late that he will dramatically lower gas prices to $ 2.50 - a - gallon if he is elected president			1
fellow @entity38 presidential candidates @entity39 and @entity40 have also pledged to bring down the cost of gasoline , though not with same rhetorical flourish as @entity44			0
" you know better , " @entity6 said monday			0
" there 's no such thing as a quick fix when it comes to high gas prices			1
there 's no silver bullet			0
anybody who tells you otherwise is n't really looking for a solution -- they 're probably just looking to ride the political wave of the moment			0
" it 's the same argument the president made during a recent speech in @entity62 and at his presidential news conference last week , trying to counter @entity38 arguments that the president is sitting idle as prices at the pump soar			0
on monday , the president ticked through a series of measures his administration had already taken to wean the country off foreign oil in the long - term , including opening new lands to domestic drilling , investing in alternative sources of energy , and raising fuel efficiency standards			0
still , both @entity38 and the president 's political advisers recognize such long - term arguments bring little solace to @entity84 who are feeling the pinch of higher gas prices now			1
indeed , a series of recent polls suggest the president 's approval rating has begun a slide into the mid 40s as gas prices tick up			1
the same polls show the president losing significant support with lower income earners who report feeling the pain of higher gas prices most acutely			1
an @entity102 / @entity101 poll reported about half of those who make less than $ 50,000 a year consider the higher gas prices a " serious hardship			1
" of that group , the president 's approval stood at 44 % , down eight points before gas prices began their climb last month			1
moreover , a @entity114 / @entity113 poll last week found 54 % feel the president does have the ability to control gas prices , compared to 36 % who say he does not			2
it is poll results like those that led the president in recent weeks to engage in an education mission of sorts over just what drives the prices of gasoline , hoping he does n't become the target of @entity84 ' frustration if prices continue their march well over $ 4.00 a gallon			2
" every time there 's instability in the @entity138 , we 'll feel it at the pump , " he said			0
" as rapidly - growing nations like @entity144 or @entity145 keep adding more cars to the road , the price of gas will rise			0
that 's not the future i want for the @entity84			0

@entity6 reiterates that no politician can bring down gas prices in short term
" we are starting to see a lot of politicians talking a lot and not doing much , " said @entity6
@entity6 targeted @entity34 's promise to lower gas to $ 2.50 a gallon , if elected
polls show link between president 's approval rating and rising gas prices
