@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 'm an attorney and i represent incarcerated people , both in my home state of @entity1 and across the @entity6			1
i spend every day with people who are poor , disadvantaged , condemned and marginalized			1
i am persuaded that we can and should do better to create more hopeful and encouraging solutions to poverty , crime and inequality in this country			0
in the last 40 years , our society has witnessed unprecedented technological change , incredible innovation and a great deal of promise and success in many areas			0
watch @entity22 's @entity21 we have also seen growing inequality , increased levels of poverty and unprecedented rates of imprisonment			1
i have come to believe that , for all the things we have accomplished , injustice , poverty and mass incarceration are stains on our society			1
they can not be ignored			0
in 1970 there were roughly 350,000 people in our jails and prisons			2
today there are more than 2.2 million			0
that 's not counting the nearly 5 million people who are on probation or parole			0
one in every 31 @entity6 is subject to some form of correctional control			1
this policy of mass incarceration did not come out of nowhere			1
it was born out of a politics of fear and anger based on now discredited theories			0
it was our response to problems in our society that we were not creative enough -- or perhaps not courageous enough -- to solve			0
public safety is a legitimate priority for any nation , but it does not explain the fact that the @entity6 now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world			1
@entity21 : @entity6 's native prisoners of war mass incarceration has been our response to poverty			1
the boom in imprisonment coincided with a retraction of programs intended to pull @entity6 out of poverty			1
and incarceration itself has a lasting impact , not just on the economic mobility of former prisoners , but on the mobility of their children and families			1
there are now more than 46 million people living below the federal poverty line in the @entity6			1
mass incarceration has been our response to mental illness			1
more than half the people in our jails and prisons have mental health problems and most are not receiving treatment			2
many of these individuals also have substance abuse disorders			0
veterans , suffering from @entity97 from their combat experience , are at increased risk of suicide in prison			0
mass incarceration has been our response to the oldest and most enduring problem of our nation : the problem of race			1
while more than one in 100 adults in @entity6 are behind bars , that number is one in 15 for @entity112 men			1
we frequently target communities of color with unequal enforcement of the law and subject too many young black and brown people to a presumption of guilt that results in disproportionate sentences and mistreatment			0
but the numbers alone do n't tell the full story			0
our sentencing practices in individual cases reveal the gross excesses of our system			2
@entity21 : @entity129 's new insights on poverty as we 've locked up more and more people , sentences have gotten harsher			0
misguided three - strikes laws have had the perverse result of sending people to prison for the rest of their lives for petty crimes like stealing a set of golf clubs			0
we are the only nation in the world that sentences children as young as 13 to die in prison			2
and we continue to have a death penalty that not only costs billions , but also produces unfair and unreliable results			0
for every nine people we have executed in the last 40 years , we have found one person on death row who was innocent			0
this error rate would be intolerable in any industry , yet where the difference is that of life or death , we are unwilling to speak up			2
why ? how has a problem that affects one in 31 @entity6 ( not to speak of their children , families , and communities ) been ignored for so long ? the answer is that mass incarceration impacts mostly the poor , the historically disfavored , the racial minority : those whose voices are rarely heard			1
spending on jails and prisons has required taking money away from education , public benefits and social welfare in too many states			2
some conservatives and progressives have begun to recognize that it 's time to dismantle the policies of mass incarceration			1
more of us must speak up			0
we must take responsibility for human suffering and despair even when we are conditioned not to see it			0
we need to challenge ourselves to work toward meaningful solutions , like rehabilitation and reform			0
we need to talk about the ugliest chapters of our history ; we need to talk about race and poverty			0
most of all we need to talk about injustice			2
because until we confront injustice , i believe its stain will shadow all of our accomplishments			2
we need to talk about injustice , because who we are as a society can not be accurately defined by our wealth , our technology , or our celebrities			2
we will be ultimately defined instead by our treatment of the poor , our compassion for the condemned , our commitment to our own humanity			1
we need to talk about injustice , so that we can create justice			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity22 .			2

@entity22 : the number of @entity6 in prisons has grown *tremendously*
he says mass incarceration is an injustice that stains @entity6
@entity22 says justice system incarcerates minor *criminals* , locks up children for life
he says @entity6 will be judged for its compassion for poor and condemned
