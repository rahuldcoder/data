he ventured out for some fresh air after police lifted their order to stay indoors			2
he looked at the boat parked in his yard			2
what he saw brought an end to the authorities ' sweeping manhunt			2
it would lead them to a fugitive , who was hiding on the floor of his boat			2
" the tarp on his winterized boat had sort of been flapping in the wind , " his stepson @entity21 told @entity0 's @entity22			1
' a million questions ' for suspect @entity2 had tied down the covering on the vessel in his backyard so firmly that it had not budged all winter long , not even through this year 's blizzards			1
" he got closer and realized that one of the retention straps had literally been cut -- not chafed , not broken or unhooked , " @entity21 said			2
@entity2 saw something else -- something on the tarp that looked like blood			1
the @entity39 resident thought some animal had forced its way into his boat			1
maybe it was a squirrel , he told his stepson			0
@entity2 climbed a stepladder to look inside			1
" he basically stuck his head under the tarp ( and ) noticed a pool of blood , " @entity21 said			1
watch : 5 days in 3 minutes ' crumpled up in a ball ' it was dark under the tarpaulin , so the boat owner could only make out vague contours , " but he definitely noticed there was something crumpled up in a ball , " the stepson said			1

@entity77 hoped to start new life in @entity79 frantic phone calls @entity21 said he tried frantically to call his mother and stepfather as he watched on tv while law officers unleashed a hailstorm of gunfire into the backyard			1
" we only saw the bullets ; we only heard that there was a man covered in blood in the boat			1
" his stepfather , @entity21 thought			0
as @entity96 reeled , younger suspect partied the couple 's landline gave him a constant busy signal			0

as soon as he arrived , his sister called him			0
" @entity107 's called , they 're safe , " she comforted him			0
" at that point , my tears of horror went to tears of joy , " @entity21 said			0
watch : final moments of standoff an end to the hunt @entity2 's call to police put an end to the hunt for the man suspected of planting one of two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the @entity6 , killing three and inflicting injuries on dozens more that are typical of wounds sustained in conflict regions such as @entity129 and @entity130			1
before police stopped him , @entity132 , with his older brother , @entity133 , allegedly shot a university policeman dead , hijacked a car at gunpoint , then fired upon and threw grenades at officers pursuing them			0
