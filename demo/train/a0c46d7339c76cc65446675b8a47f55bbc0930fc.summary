-- since the 1999 debut of his hit series " @entity4 , " @entity1 has been best known for his filthy fiefdom of anarchic , envelope - pushing cartoons			1
lately he 's been expanding his empire , hosting " snl , " recording a @entity17 - nominated album of standards and show tunes , and directing a @entity10 blockbuster , " @entity14 , " in which @entity11 gave voice to a horny , drug - abusing toy bear			1
his official coronation as a showbiz don came earlier this month , when he was announced as next year 's @entity22 host			1
but the 39 - year - old confesses , " i love a good fart joke			1
" @entity25 to host 2013 @entity22 why do the @entity22 frequently suck , and how will you make them better ? all of them have had redeeming qualities			1
it 's about finding that balance between doing what i do but acknowledging that this is the @entity22 , not the roast of @entity35			1
it 's walking that line between old - fashioned showmanship and allowing it to be contemporary with a little bit of bite			1
@entity42 and @entity43 are two hosts who walked that line			1
there 's a moment on " @entity4 " that 's just @entity48 dancing with @entity49 -- that 's what we have to achieve , a dance between the traditional and the new			1
are you going to write the show with your " @entity4 " team ? the staff has n't been assembled			2
but this is not going to be " @entity4 meets the @entity22			1
" hosts who come in with a specific brand and try to turn the show into the brand , it never works			2
you have to adapt yourself to the @entity22 , not vice versa			1
for all its success , " @entity4 " is sometimes dismissed as frat - boy humor			1
does that surprise you ? a lot of that comes , i think , from people who have n't actually seen the show			2
they 're going with what they 've heard			2
the show itself contains a degree of frat - boy humor -- there are fart jokes , there are shit jokes			1
but we try to include an equal amount of intelligent humor			2
if it makes you laugh , what 's wrong with that ? there 's room for both highbrow and lowbrow			2
' snl ' recap : @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 @entity100 has said he loves " @entity4 , " but the show has also been mocked by " @entity102 " and " @entity103			1
" did you ever feel like you were on the outside of some comedy in - crowd ? at one point , that was the case			1
but the " @entity4 " crowd and the " @entity102 " crowd have become friendly over time			2
i thought the " @entity103 " episode making fun of us was funny and accurate			2
but what i do n't understand is the personal venom that they spew in the press about the show and about me , where it 's not in the context of a joke			1
that 's a little baffling			2
they let loose with this vitriol in every interview i read with them			0
it 'd be interesting to know where it comes from , because i do n't know them			0
as someone who pokes fun at pieties , what are your thoughts on the " @entity138 " video and the riots it provoked ? in all honesty , i glaze over with this stuff because it happens all the time over there			0
there 's just constant boiling rage -- it 's like , " what else is new ? " it 's just another round of religious - based fury			1
it 's like following the presidential race			0
review : ' @entity14 ' you 're rebooting the @entity156 science show " @entity157			1
" do you hope creationists tune in ? among others			0
the show does n't have an agenda			0
it 's going to be educational			0
science has become politicized , and that 's an embarrassment			0
evolution does n't care whether you believe in it or not , no more than gravity does			0
i want to rekindle excitement over what we 've achieved as a species with the space program			0
we ca n't afford to regress back to the days of superstition			0
surreal @entity175 staged at @entity176 " @entity14 " was about a kid who retains a childhood fantasy into adulthood			1
you 're unmarried , and you make your living in cartoons			0
do you feel a bit like an overgrown kid ? oddly , i do n't relate a lot to that character			0
i never had a stuffed animal i wished would come to life			0
the story felt universal enough to resonate			0
but working in entertainment , you have to retain a degree of childishness			0
that 's one reason @entity196 has been so successful : he 's been able to maintain that sense of wonder into adulthood			0
i suppose that makes people like us a little more stunted than everyone else , emotionally			0
