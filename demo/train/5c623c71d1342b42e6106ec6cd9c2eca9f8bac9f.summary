@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a chilly morning after thousands took to the streets to protest yet another grand jury 's refusal to indict a white police officer for killing an unarmed black man , tourists vied for spots on the @entity11 to photograph the @entity12 and @entity13			1
the ferry is the only way to get from lower @entity16 -- without a car , of course -- to the north shore of @entity1 's least populated and whitest borough			1
on the other side of the harbor , just blocks from the ferry terminal , is @entity24 , the neighborhood where @entity25 lived and died			1
@entity25 , 43 , was a father of six and a grandfather			1
he died july 17 after police officer @entity27 tackled him to the ground in a department - banned chokehold during an arrest for selling cigarettes illegally			2
@entity25 's death occurred weeks before @entity34 , @entity35 , police officer @entity36 shot unarmed teenager @entity37 to death on august 9			1
a @entity40 grand jury last week declined to indict @entity36 , setting off days of unrest			0
on the journey from @entity16 , where hordes of protesters stopped traffic on wednesday and thursday , to the @entity0 street where @entity25 was killed , people were asked three questions			1
what do the deaths of @entity37 and @entity25 say about race in @entity52 ? how would your life be different if you were of a different race or class ? do you believe justice is colorblind ? @entity59 and his daughter @entity61 sat on the @entity0 - bound ferry , watching tourists snap photos of the @entity12			1
the @entity52 is not all it 's made out to be , @entity59 said			2
the grand jury decision to not indict @entity66 was not unexpected			0
" we 've become desensitized to these murders , " said @entity59 , whose son was friends with @entity25 , known in the neighborhood as " @entity70 " " it 's business as usual in @entity52			1
" " it 's bad , " his 14 - year - old daughter said			2
" we die and they do n't do anything about it			0
" @entity59 said his son and @entity25 sold " loosie " cigarettes to make a few dollars " instead of stealing			1
" his son saw @entity25 die , he said			1
" he said , ' @entity82 , i had to walk away			0
they killed @entity84 and i could n't do anything about it			0
' " asked if life would be different if his race was different , @entity59 smiled			0
" it 's called the privileged race , " he said			2
" i 'd probably be president			0
" @entity91 and his wife , may , on wednesday stood near @entity93 in @entity16			0
they watched hundreds of protesters on the streets			0
on thursday , waiting for the ferry , the couple visiting from @entity98 read a front - page newspaper article about the protests			0
" both these two guys are black and they were killed for small crimes , " said @entity91			0
" police use tough measures against unarmed black people			2
it looks like white policemen are trained to act like that			0
" " racism is more of a problem than we hoped it would be , " he added			0
@entity25 's father , @entity115 , has been holding an almost daily vigil near the makeshift shrine at the spot where his son died			1
" i just want to make sure that people come here to honor and remember my son , " he said			1
" @entity124 was on display on the streets of @entity1 , but there was none of the looting and violence seen in @entity34			2
to @entity133 , who knew @entity25 for 25 years , the sidewalk where his friend died is sacred ground			1
so many young black men are dying , he said			0
" the government worries about all these other countries , but what about folks being killed by the police on our streets ? " he asked			0
@entity143 , who is @entity144 , has run @entity145 on @entity146 for 15 years			0
as @entity66 grabbed @entity25 in a chokehold , the officer and the man he took down nearly crashed through the window of @entity143 's shop			1
a memorial of white flowers , handwritten notes and burning candles marks the spot on a sidewalk where @entity25 uttered his last words : " i ca n't breathe			1
" " why do we have to be scared of the cops ? " @entity143 asked			0
@entity161 has owned @entity162 © on @entity146 for three decades			0
she looked down the street at the people gathered around @entity25 's memorial and lamented that @entity52 was far from guaranteeing " equal justice for all			1
" outside a pharmacy on @entity170 , @entity168 said the @entity25 case was not about race			1
though @entity0 is more than three - quarters white , the north shore is more diverse			1
" it 's sad what happened but most people here get along , " she said			1
the borough -- the only one not reachable by the city 's subway system -- is home to many firefighters and police officers			2
on september 11 , 2001 , more than 250 @entity184 died when the @entity186 towers fell			2
" justice is colorblind , " @entity168 said			0
" a lot of people do n't care about race			2
but there are always some people who are prejudiced			0

@entity24 is the @entity0 neighborhood where @entity25 lived and died
his friends and neighbors share their thoughts with @entity2
@entity25 's father wants people to honor his son ; " no violence . we live here "
