-- in that never - ending search for " the next big thing in tech , " talk has turned to wearable gadgets , especially in the form of a smartwatch that syncs with your smartphone			1
just about every major tech company from @entity11 to @entity12 to @entity13 is reportedly working on its own take on the concept			1
assuming the reports are true -- and they 're far too numerous and consistent not to be -- a big wave of new smartwatches is coming soon			2
but these wrist gadgets are nothing new			0
in fact , smartwatches have a long history of failure , especially in recent years as the modern smartphone market began its explosive growth			2
too many companies tried too hard to make the dream of a @entity27 - style watch happen before we were ready for it			1
there 's an extensive list of smartwatch blunders in recent years			2
@entity33 created a software platform called spot that delivered news updates to watches via fm radio waves for $ 59 a year			0
companies such as @entity40 and @entity41 signed on to make compatible devices , but spot bombed			1
@entity33 killed it in 2008			0
then there were watches that doubled as smartphones			0
@entity47 and @entity12 gave that category a whirl late last decade , but the devices were way too expensive and not nearly as functional as a traditional smartphone			1
and @entity52 , a company desperately trying to remain relevant in today 's mobile - centric world , still sells an @entity55 - based smartwatch that it introduced last year , but reviews of the device are pretty bad			1
so are @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 setting themselves up for failure ? no way			1
look at it this way			0
tablets were nothing new when @entity11 introduced the @entity63 in 2010			1
@entity33 was even noodling around with making a bigger push in the space at the time until @entity11 came along and completely redefined the category			1
in three short years , tablets have started eating into traditional pc sales as people prefer to buy a device that can do most of the things their laptop can at a fraction of the price			0
it seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted @entity11 's @entity63			1
last year , a company called @entity80 caused a lot of hype when it raised a whopping $ 10.3 million on @entity83 from 68,000 people			0
@entity80 makes a smartwatch with a black - and - white screen similar to the @entity88 display on your @entity89			2
it can connect to your @entity55 phone or @entity94 via @entity95 and display incoming text messages and other notifications			0
plus it lets you control basic phone functions such as the music player			0
with all the hype surrounding this tiny startup , it feels like the hokeyness of a wrist computer has all but evaporated in the public 's eye			0
the answer seems to be to make a device that is n't a replacement for your smartphone , but a clever companion , something that takes away the need to pull out your phone from your pocket or purse			2
instead , you 'll just glance at your wrist , as if you were simply checking the time , to see what 's going on in the world			0
or , with @entity13 's much - anticipated @entity123 connected headset , you 'll glance up at a tiny screen above your eye			1
according to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site @entity129 , the top five features respondents said they 'd like to see in a smartwatch were e-mail and texting , phone calls , @entity136 , @entity137 and weather updates -- the same features people now rely on in their smartphones			2
we were n't ready for smartwatches before , but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives , @entity11 and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance			1
