records of dead veterans were changed or physically altered , some even in recent weeks , to hide how many people died while waiting for care at the @entity6 , a whistle - blower told @entity7 in stunning revelations that point to a new coverup in the ongoing @entity11 scandal			1
" deceased " notes on files were removed to make statistics look better , so veterans would not be counted as having died while waiting for care , @entity12 said			1
@entity12 is the actual scheduling clerk at the @entity11 who said for the better part of a year she was ordered by supervisors to manage and handle the so - called " secret waiting list , " where veterans ' names of those seeking medical care were often placed , sometimes left for months with no care at all			1
for these reasons , @entity12 is among the most important and central people to the @entity11 scandal over a secret wait list , veterans ' wait times and deaths			1
despite being in the center of the storm , @entity12 has never spoken publicly about any of it -- the secret list , the altering of records , the dozens of veterans she believes have died waiting for care -- until now			1
records changed it was one of @entity12 's roles to call veterans when appointments became available to schedule them to get a consultation			1
sometimes when she made those calls , she 'd find that the veteran had died , so she would enter that on their records			0
but at least seven times since last october , records that showed that veterans died while waiting for care -- records which @entity12 personally handled and had entered in details of veterans ' deaths -- were physically altered , or written over , by someone else , @entity12 said in an exclusive interview with @entity7			1
the changes , or re-writes , listed the veterans as living , not deceased , essentially hiding their deaths			2
the alterations had even occurred in recent weeks , she said , in a deliberate attempt to try to hide just how many veterans died while waiting for care , by trying to pretend dead veterans remain alive			0
" because by doing that , that placed ( the veterans ) back on the wait list , " said @entity12 , explaining she believes that the purpose of " bringing them back to life " in the paperwork and putting the veterans back on the electronic waiting list was to hide the fact that veterans died waiting for care			1
" i would say ( it was done to ) hide the fact			0
because it is marked a death			0
and that death needs to be reported			0
so if you change that to , ' entered in error ' or , my personal favorite , ' no longer necessary , ' that makes the death go away			0
so the death would never be reported then			0
" ' into a desk drawer ' beginning early last year , @entity12 said she was also instructed to hide the crisis at the @entity11 medical center by concealing new requests for treatment			1
this was at a time when the @entity11 was paying bonuses to senior staff whose facilities met the goals of providing care in a timely manner for veterans , typically within 14 days			1
new requests by veterans wanting treatment were actually stuffed into a drawer , to make the books look better , according to @entity12			1
asked what happened to the new requests for appointments , @entity12 said : " they went into a desk drawer ...			1
that would be the secret list			0
" there was " no doubt " it was , in fact , a secret list , she said			0
@entity12 's claims support those of dr. @entity130 , now retired from the @entity11 , who spoke to @entity7 in march and raised the lid on the @entity6 crisis and allegations that up to 40 veterans died while waiting for care			1
since november 2013 @entity7 has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across @entity11 hospitals around the country			1
massive investigation the concerns over delays in care and deaths of veterans across the country created a national furor during the last six weeks that prompted @entity151 hearings and ultimately led to the resignation of president @entity154 's @entity153 , @entity155			1
investigators from the @entity11 's inspector general 's office have been in @entity159 looking into the charges by @entity12 , @entity130 and other @entity11 whistle - blowers			1
the teams include criminal investigators			0
the @entity11 's @entity164 also has investigators in 69 other locations , looking into charges of other data manipulation , delays and deaths , and allegations of whistle - blower retaliation			1
report : veterans neglected for years in @entity11 facility @entity12 said she has " submitted evidence " to criminal investigators about the altering of records and also the secret list and how it worked			1
officials at the @entity182 @entity181 did not respond specifically to any of @entity12 's allegations			1
instead a spokesman sent @entity7 a generic statement stating : " as acting secretary @entity186 has said at @entity11 facilities around the country , we must work together to fix the unacceptable , systemic problems in accessing @entity11 healthcare			1
we know that in many communities , including @entity6 , veterans wait too long for the care they 've earned and deserve			2
that 's why @entity11 is taking action to accelerate access to care and reaching out to veterans to get them off wait lists and into clinics			1
" the statement added : " we respect the independent review and recommendations of the @entity164 ( @entity164 ) regarding systemic issues with patient scheduling and access , and we await the @entity164 's final review			2
" ' beyond horrible ' it has been an horrific year for @entity12			2
in early 2013 , the waiting list at the @entity11 was so long that 1,700 veterans were on it , and many vets could not get an appointment for as much as nine months , or longer , @entity12 said			1
on average there were requests from 40 new patients a day , she said			0
@entity12 says the hospital administration knew it , but was so focused on meeting an immediate goal , the patients did n't matter			2
" it 's beyond horrible , " she said , tearing up at times during the interview			2
@entity12 said in addition to keeping the secret list and keeping quiet when she learned veterans on the list died , she was also pushed to clear up the backlog on the electronic waiting list , which put pressure on follow - up care as well			1
there simply were not enough doctors -- and not enough appointments -- to handle new patients , backlogged patients and even very sick patients			0
@entity12 , a scheduling clerk , was suddenly making life and death decisions			1
doctors , nurses and emergency room providers were calling her trying to get appointments for individual patients who could n't wait			0
" and that really overtook even the wait list , " @entity12 said			2
" because now i have a consult where veterans are very sick			0
so i have to ease up on the wait list			0
it sounds so wrong to say , but i tried to work these scheduled appointments so at least i felt the sickest of the sick were being treated			0
" @entity252 action on @entity11 : too little , too late the stress , @entity12 said , was unbearable			1
then came the call she had to make in early december			0
she finally had an appointment available for a @entity257 veteran who had come to the @entity11 months earlier urinating blood			2
" i called the family			0
and that 's when i found out that he was dead , " she said			0
turning point @entity12 would not tell @entity7 the patient 's name			1
but @entity7 interviewed @entity265 and @entity266 earlier this year , and the stories match			2
@entity268 , @entity266 's father and a @entity257 veteran , died in november 2013 after being repeatedly denied care at the @entity11			2
@entity12 called the home and reached @entity272 , telling her the @entity11 finally had a primary appointment for her father - in - law			1
@entity266 told @entity7 she was incensed , as @entity266 had just passed away			2
" i said , ' really , you 're a little too late , sweetheart , ' " she told @entity7 previously			2
@entity12 said that conversation was a turning point -- hearing the anger from the family and details on how the veteran died screaming that veterans did not deserve such treatment			1
" and i promised her that i would do everything in my power to never have this happen to another veteran again , " she said			0
going public @entity12 said that 's when she and @entity130 began seriously talking about what could be done			1
in december of last year @entity12 and @entity130 told everything to the @entity11 's @entity164			1
" i thought that was a saving grace , " @entity12 said			2
" i thought , ' okay , this is it			0
this is gon na be all over , ' you know ? then it was n't			0
and we were waiting , and waiting , and waiting , and waiting			0
and nothing ever happened ... nothing			0
we did n't hear anything			0
the leadership ( in @entity159 ) was telling us , ' oh , we passed everything			0
we 're not doing anything wrong			0
' and i 'm like , ' we 're not doing anything wrong ? but people are still dying ? ' " @entity12 said they were giving up hope and decided for @entity130 to contact the media			2
@entity12 said until now she was simply too scared to come forward			2
and she is still scared			0
" my life will change after this comes out			0
i will have people at work who are not going to like me because of what i 've done			0
and i 'll have other people at work who will say thank you for doing what you 've done			0
" @entity12 believes her information on what she says is an ongoing coverup at the @entity11 is in the hands of the @entity324			1
performance reviews at troubled @entity11 showed no bad senior managers @entity11 officials still on payroll during termination process @entity324 launches criminal probe of @entity11			0
