-- the letter in the @entity3 mail came as a surprise			0
not the return address -- @entity6 had been corresponding with her old fifth - grade teacher for several years , so she recognized the address of the retirement community in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but when @entity6 , who lives in @entity12 , opened the envelope , she found something she was n't expecting			0
it was a photocopy of an old @entity17 card			1
there were many signatures on the card			1
she found her own name among them			0
she was @entity24 back then , a fifth - grader at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity11			1
miss @entity27 had been the teacher			1
that 's how all of her students , all of the 10 - and 11 - year - olds in that 1958 classroom , referred to her			1
@entity27 was her full name			1
" she 's still @entity36 to me , " @entity6 , now 65 , told me the other day			1
" she was such a wonderful teacher -- she brought such excitement and enthusiasm to her job			2
you could tell she was n't just going through the motions			0
my own love of history started in that classroom			0
" her admiration for @entity36 is what led @entity6 to seek her out and start writing to her			1
at 86 , miss @entity27 chooses not to use e-mail -- she writes her letters in elegant longhand			1
the old card -- the kind you would buy at a drugstore -- featured the embossed message : " you 're such a sweet person , so thoughtful and kind , that days such as this , always bring you to mind			2
" surrounding those words were all the signatures -- written neatly in fountain pen , in children 's script			1
the names were of the students in miss @entity27 's class : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , many more			1
there was the signature of one child -- @entity77 , is what he wrote -- a sprightly , friendly boy who , three years later , would lose his life in an automobile accident			0
miss @entity27 , in 1958 , was unmarried and had no children			1
yet the boys and girls had decided to present her with the @entity17 card			1
and she had saved it for all these years			0
i called her last week at the retirement community in @entity11			0
she has been a widow since 2011 ; at age 39 she married @entity89 , an electrical engineer in the aeronautics field , and they remained wed for 46 years until his death			0
" i 'm not mrs. @entity93 to my old students , " she said			2
" i 'm always @entity36			1
which is fine with me			0
" i asked her about the card			2
" i was surprised , and so touched , that they would give that to me , " she said			0
she said that she had kept it in a " treasure chest " -- a footlocker where she has preserved all of her most precious memories			0
" to me , the card meant that the boys and girls knew how much i cared for them , " she said			2
" as a teacher , you always hope that you mean something to the children , and you hope that they understand how much they matter to you			1
" as i look at the card from time to time , i see also that it is a sign that we accomplished one of our goals that year			2
in the fifth grade , students were expected to learn how to write in cursive , in ink			1
when you use ink , in a fountain pen , there is no erasing , no way to cover your mistakes			0
so i think they were showing that to me , too			0
" she told me that she grew up an only child in @entity132 , @entity11 , a town of just 250 people			0
she said that a career teaching fifth grade -- she spent 30 years doing it -- was a full and satisfying way to spend her life			2
at @entity25 , where she taught for 16 of those years , she said her classroom was on the top floor , overlooking @entity142			2
" it was @entity144 40 , " she said			0
i would tell the boys and girls to look out the window at the cars on the street , and to try to imagine the covered wagons moving west all those years ago , right there , carrying people who had left everything behind to start a new life			0
" the main reason she has kept the @entity17 card , she said , was a simple one : " i never had children of my own			1
" it is the only @entity17 card i ever received			1
" she said that , as a teacher , " you sometimes look out into your classroom and silently think , ' i wonder what will happen to them when they grow up			2
' " fifty - five years later , it is a sunday in may again			2
she is 86 , and on her own			0
in those 30 years of teaching , more than 700 boys and girls moved through her classrooms			2
i know every person who signed that card ; i know those who are living , and i knew those who have passed away			0
and on this , i think i can safely speak for all of them			0
the words on the card still hold true : "			0
so thoughtful and kind , that days such as this , always bring you to mind			0
" happy @entity17 , @entity36			1

@entity187 : former *classmate* 's fifth - grade teacher sent copy of 1958 @entity17 card

@entity187 : miss @entity27 says she treasures card ; only @entity17 card she 's received
@entity187 : she 's taught 700 kids ; all would surely say : happy @entity17 , miss @entity27
