-- @entity2 's shock resignation in february -- the first for almost 600 years -- sent experts inside and outside the @entity5 rushing to consult church law to work out what will happen next			1
the ensuing conclave fever has unearthed some quirky facts alongside the more significant			2
here 's a selection to drop into conversation			0
conclave means " with key			2
" the elaborate voting process dates to the early @entity15 and was born out of frustration after a gathering of cardinals took nearly three years to select a pope			1
the locals got so fed up , they tore the roof off the building where the cardinals were meeting and then decided to lock the cardinals in , to speed up a decision			2
why cardinals once took three years to choose pope bread and water eventually pope @entity31 was chosen			1
he wanted to avoid a repeat of his own experience and thus the conclave became a tradition			2
cardinals in the future would get only one dish at their noon and evening meal if they took more than three days to decide ... and only bread , water , and wine if it went beyond eight			2
gone are those food restrictions but pope @entity31 would be proud , more recently , that the cardinals have , on average , chosen a pope in roughly three days			1
@entity48 luxury while @entity31 's approach had been to make conditions so spartan that the cardinals were pressured into making a decision fast , historian and author @entity54 said the cardinals of the @entity48 expected to live more comfortably			2
they moved the conclave from the @entity58 of @entity59 -- or the @entity60 -- to the @entity5 because the palace had become so rickety			2
voting was initially held in the @entity5 's @entity63 but since 1878 the @entity64 has consistently been the venue			1
conclave doctor while the cardinal - electors are locked in the @entity64 on their own for the actual balloting process , they 're not entirely alone for the length of the conclave			1
alongside officials such as the @entity74 and masters of ceremonies , priests must be available for hearing confessions , two medical doctors for possible emergencies , and an adequate team of domestic staff to prepare and serve meals , and for general housekeeping , according to monsignor @entity84			0
in his guide to the @entity86			0
@entity84 said these staff are also bound to observe total confidentiality and must swear an oath in @entity90			0
male and unmarried ? there is nothing to prohibit votes being cast for someone outside the @entity96			1
@entity0 's @entity5 expert @entity97 said any person who would be eligible for ordination to the catholic priesthood -- therefore an unmarried male -- could be elected as pope			1
but he said in practice the new pope will be elected from among the cardinals who are voting			1
only one man elected pope has not been a cardinal			1
archbishop @entity109 of @entity110 in @entity90 was named pope @entity109 back in 1378			2
@entity84 warned that this led to the @entity113 , which divided @entity114 for almost 40 years -- until pope @entity116 's resignation			1
bookmakers are also allowing bets on outsiders ranging from @entity121 singer @entity120 to disgraced @entity123 cyclist @entity122 to lead the church			0
the 10,000 - 1 odds are perhaps an indication that the outcome of the conclave will remain traditional			1
gambling with @entity129 : staking a wager on the next pope @entity90 advantage ? @entity90 have clearly had the home field advantage , dominating the papacy through the centuries			0
the conclave of 1978 produced the closest thing to a genuine surprise we 've had in decades , in @entity140 , the first non-italian in 500 years			0
and while the election of this @entity145 cardinal was a shock , the cardinal electors had looked outside @entity90 before , though not often			1
in 1492 , the conclave selected a @entity148 , pope @entity149 ... and in previous centuries , a pope was chosen from @entity152 and another from the @entity153			1
why me ? behind @entity156 's " @entity157 " painting lies the @entity158 -- the @entity159 , where the newly elected pope goes to change out of his red cardinals robes into the white vestments of the pope			1
@entity165 @entity164 said the room was so - named " because the poor man obviously breaks down at being elected			1
" what to wear , what to wear @entity111			0
@entity84 said three sizes of soutane , large , medium and small , would be laid out in the @entity158 , ready to be adjusted to fit the pope - elect			2
if he is not already a bishop , the @entity173 would ordain him			0
red slippers @entity176 gave popes the privileges of emperors -- meaning they could wear red shoes			0
it had been believed that @entity2 's slippers were made by @entity90 fashion house @entity183			2
@entity0 's @entity185 revealed that it was not in fact so			0
and @entity187 spoke to a @entity189 cobbler as well as some designers responsible for the papal robes			0
wrong ransacking @entity54 said there had been a tradition that the residents of @entity195 would ransack the dwelling of the cardinal that was elected to be pope -- on the grounds that he did n't need it anymore			1
there was at least one example of the @entity203 people ransacking the house of the wrong cardinal , during the 400 to 500 years the tradition was followed , he said			0
" not only did he not become pope but he did n't have anything left in his house			0
" you have been watching @entity5 spokesman the rev. @entity211 told @entity0 that @entity213 @entity212 watched on television as cardinals took their oath of secrecy in the @entity64 to begin the conclave to elect his successor , and also saw on television the black smoke from the @entity64 tuesday night to indicate they had not agreed on anyone yet			1
definitely not @entity223 it was n't until the end of the 10th century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with , said eminent @entity90 church historian @entity230			0
but since then only one , @entity231 in the 16th century , has kept his baptismal name			0
in the long history of popes , stretching back two millennia to @entity223 , some names have picked up negative associations , while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change			0
while we wait to hear what the 266th pope of the @entity227 will call himself , we can be sure of only one thing , according to @entity230 : the new pope will not be called @entity223			0
this is out of respect for the first @entity223 , the @entity250 -- but perhaps also reflects a centuries ' old prophecy that a @entity253 will be the very last pope to serve .			0

*115* cardinal - electors are gathered in the @entity64 to choose a new pope
conclave follows the resignation of @entity2 and is conducted in secrecy
in theory , any unmarried male @entity263 could be elected as pope
in practice , it will be one of the cardinals involved in the voting process
