-- it was over seven months ago , but @entity2 clearly remembers when he was struck by the butt of the @entity4 and feeling the heat of the gunman 's breath as he hissed : " i will cut your neck , i will throw you overboard			0
" @entity2 was the senior crewman aboard the @entity11 1 when it was boarded by nearly a dozen pirates off the west coast of @entity15			1
when the leader of the pirates asked for the highest ranking crewman , @entity2 stepped forward only to be kicked and beaten			1
@entity2 , who had been a seafarer for 22 of his 52 years of life , believed he was about to die			0
for eleven days the multi-national crew of 25 , including 14 @entity22 , were held hostage , but thankfully their lives were spared			1
during those difficult days @entity2 thought back to a simple eight - hour training course he took at the @entity26			0
the course was a simple one involving simulations and classroom sessions that focused on dangers at sea , including surviving a hostage situation			1
that course is mandatory for all seafarers by the @entity22 government			1
a third of all international seafarers are @entity22 , which also makes them the largest group of hostages at sea			1
" i remember , make friends with ( the pirates ) , " says @entity2			1
" do n't make war			0
" everyday i say , ' my brother , my brother , please do n't kill us			0
please , i have family also			0
my son is in school			0
' one of the pirates , i think he 's a @entity55 , so we make a bible study			2
" those odd moments of a @entity59 hostage studying the bible with his pirate captor , is what @entity2 believes led to his and his crew 's survival			2
on september 24th , eleven days after their ordeal began , the pirates took as much cargo and money as they could carry and took off			2
@entity2 credits the anti-piracy course for his survival , but the @entity76 's @entity75 , the country 's second largest union of seafarers , says the course is simply not enough			2
" anti-piracy training is not totally the solution , " said union head @entity78			0
the union believes what 's really needed is a naval escort or private armed security on - board			0
the union readily admits the @entity22 's navy is too poorly financed to even consider a naval escort for every citizen at sea , but wants the vessels ' country of origin to provide the protection			1
the union knows that it 's an empty call to action , asking other governments to protect foreign workers aboard ships in international waters			2
what the union wo n't do is urge its members to stop working at sea , even in the regions where pirates readily take seafarers hostage			1
the reason is that life at sea pays far better than a job on @entity22 soil : 40 % of @entity22 live on less than two dollars a day , while the starting salary for seafarers like @entity2 is $ 1,500 a month			1
thirty - year - old @entity112 was on the same ship as @entity2 , and says he will go back to sea because he needs to support his family			2
" going abroad as a @entity22 , it 's better			1
the salary there , we can not find here			0
so by going abroad , you can easily build up your dreams , have a house , own a car , support your family and send your kids to a good school			0
" " if i get hurt , it 's a part of life , " he adds .			0

one third of all seafarers on international vessels are from the @entity22
perils of being taken hostage or killed by pirates a very real threat
those who have survived hostage situation say they will return to the sea
pay for sailors is far higher than for many in the @entity22
