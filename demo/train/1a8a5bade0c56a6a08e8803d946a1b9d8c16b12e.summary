-- @entity1 is gone , replaced by a new feature that combines its @entity4 social site and renowned restaurant reviewers @entity6			1
announced wednesday , @entity7 is the latest push by @entity7 to incorporate its networking site into more of its other products , with the goal of creating a single , seamless web experience			1
@entity7 is designed to let users discover and share information about local restaurants , shops and other sites			1
" finding the best places to go is an essential part of our lives , as are the people and resources that help us make those decisions , " @entity7 product manager @entity19 wrote on the company 's official blog			0
" in fact , the opinions of friends , family or other trusted sources are often the first we seek when looking for the perfect restaurant for date night or the cafe that makes the best latte ever			0
" a new " local " tab on the side of a @entity4 page lets users click and search			1
results will include reviews from @entity6 , which @entity7 bought in september , as well as ratings and comments from friends			1
the results also will appear when @entity7 users search for a local site using @entity7 search or @entity1			1
companies listed on the less - social @entity1 can be converted over to @entity4			2
according to the blog @entity55 , roughly 80 million businesses ' pages already had been converted wednesday morning			0
@entity4 reports being up to about 100 million users since opening to the public in september			2
that 's a far cry from @entity61 's roughly 900 million accounts			0
some in the tech world were saying wednesday that @entity63 might be a way to begin catching up			0
" what @entity7 still lacks in @entity4 is a way of getting different businesses ' networks to interact with each other -- meaning , @entity61 may have its own @entity73 , but it also has a range of apps from others , like @entity77 and more , that enhance that experience , " wrote @entity65 of @entity66			2
" @entity7 is still largely relying on its own data to get the job done			0
that could make the experience more cohesive , or ( the problem @entity4 has been having up to now ) a little too quiet			0

@entity63 will replace @entity1 for local *recommendations*
the tool incorporates reviews from @entity6 as well as from users ' friends
@entity7 is working to incorporate @entity4 with its other products
