-- flying @entity1 ? you might have to wait until your flight crew rests up if your travel includes @entity6 's @entity5 or the three @entity8 - area airports			1
blaming a weekend of bad winter weather and new @entity11 rules on pilot duty times , @entity1 canceled nearly all operations from monday afternoon into tuesday morning at @entity5 , @entity8 's @entity15 and @entity16 airports , and @entity17 in @entity18			1
@entity1 , the only airline to say publicly that the new pilot rest rules contributed to its cancellation of flights during this week 's winter blast , had asked regulators for a delay in implementing the changes			1
@entity11 spokeswoman @entity26 said that @entity1 last year requested an extension to the january 4 , 2014 , implementation deadline			2
@entity1 was the only airline to request an extension , she said			2
the @entity11 denied the airline 's request			0
on tuesday morning , @entity1 planned to ramp up operations to about 25 % of its regular schedule and expected to become 100 % operational by 3 p.m. et , according to @entity1 spokesman @entity35			2
@entity35 said tuesday that the new scheduling rules related to pilot rest time " are a factor , not a driver , in our recovery from two winter storms and @entity15 infrastructure issues			1
" statements from the airline on monday suggested the pilot rules were a bigger factor in the carrier 's near - halt in the @entity49			1
while saying @entity1 was prepared for the new rules that increase rest requirements for pilots , scheduling pilots and crews is a " delicate " operation under normal circumstances , spokeswoman @entity50 wrote via e-mail			1
" delays or cancellations disrupt those handoffs placing crews or planes ' out of position ' for their flights			2
" " in the midst of us repairing those schedules disrupted by this week 's winter storms , we 're facing an additional challenge as new @entity11 rules went into effect for crew rest , " she wrote			2
" these rules further impact our ability to operate an already disrupted schedule , causing our pilots to ' time out ' even sooner			0
as a result , additional cancellations are likely to occur as we work to reset the operation			0
" more than 400 @entity1 flights were canceled monday , with 120 flight cancellations on tuesday , the airline said			1
nationwide , more than 4,500 flights were canceled monday , and more than 2,300 flights have been canceled for tuesday , according to flight tracking site @entity89			0
@entity1 said it is scheduling extra flights to address the backlog and will extend apologies and compensation offers to passengers			0
passengers whose flights have been canceled should not go to the airport , the airline said			0
the airline has compiled its advice to stranded passengers in a blog post , with links to the fee waiver policy and rebooking page			0
the @entity11 announced the pilot changes in december 2011 , and they went into effect saturday			0
pilot fatigue became a top priority for the @entity109 , which oversees the @entity11 , after the february 2009 crash of @entity111 near @entity112 , @entity8			0
the new rules require a minimum 10 - hour rest period for pilots before their flight duty period , which can range from nine to 14 hours , depending on the start time and the number of flight segments and time zones crossed			1
while other @entity122 airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights because of severe weather patterns , no other major @entity122 airline contacted by @entity0 has cited the new rules as a cause			1
an airline pilots union said the airlines had sufficient time to adjust to the new @entity11 work rules			1
" they had two years to anticipate this ( work hour rule ) and to adjust accordingly , " said @entity130 , vice president of the @entity131			0
" so i think it 's overly simplistic to suggest that they could ascribe this disruption -- which happens to coincide with this major , major winter snowstorm -- and just hang it all on that rule - making change			0
" while the new pilot rest rules may be one of the many things that have disrupted air travel this week , @entity140 's @entity139 said the airlines are looking to blame others for not hiring enough pilots to withstand disruptions to their schedules			1
" the rules are necessary for passenger safety , ( and ) the airlines have had years to prepare , " he said			1
at the end of the day , " the airlines really ca n't withstand irregular events like these , " @entity139 said			2
" they have really bad emergency management plans in place			0
" @entity0 's @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
