@entity22 , @entity23 : i 'm @entity25 and this is @entity0 ! it is the first day of june and our last week before summer break			2
thank you very much for joining us			2
first up : a look back @entity32 : first up , a major move for the country 's largest automaker as @entity36 is expected to file for bankruptcy today			1
this comes one month after @entity39 , another of the so - called " @entity42 " @entity6 car companies , did the very same thing			1
under the terms of @entity36 ' bankruptcy , the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government			2
thirty years ago , @entity36 made up more than 40 percent of @entity6 auto sales			1
today , that number is 19 percent			2
the company 's reported more than $ 90 billion in losses since 2005			1
as the bankruptcy process begins , @entity52 looks back at the history of @entity36 and the @entity6 car			1
( @entity56 ) @entity57 , @entity58 business correspondent : @entity59 started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board ; 1908 was the birth of @entity6 car culture			1
that same year , @entity36 was formed in @entity65 , @entity66			2
it was n't until 1925 when the " @entity42 " was complete with the formation of @entity39			2
@entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 : when the @entity42 emerged , they not only emerged as rivals that really gave @entity6 much better automobiles at the time , but they also cemented the @entity6 automobile as a world standard			1
romans : " as goes @entity36 , so goes the nation			0
" that phrase defined @entity6 's economic power for much of the last century			1
@entity81 , economist , @entity83 : so many folks were either employed at @entity36 or the other two major car makers , making steel and all the other components that go into cars			0
it just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering , the country was prospering , too			0
@entity77 : today , there are 74,000 rank - and - file @entity36 workers in the @entity6 but in its heyday , @entity36 was the largest industrial company in the world ; a technology leader			1
by 1979 , 600,000 people worked for @entity36 those good jobs helped build @entity6 's middle class			1
@entity100 : it also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb , to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas			0
@entity77 : @entity36 was the company that revolutionized what we drove , how we thought about our cars , and how we paid for them			0
@entity36 invented auto loans and the model year			1
it was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts ; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s			0
@entity120 adopted flashy fins with the @entity122 , as did @entity39 with the popular @entity123			0
automobiles from the @entity42 put their stamp on popular culture , from music to movies to television			0
what 's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was " @entity132 " by @entity133 , about a @entity36 product			1
the @entity135 , considered by many to be the first true muscle car , was showcased in a song by @entity139			0
@entity139 , " @entity139 " : @entity139 , you really ...			0
@entity77 : the @entity141 on @entity142			0
the 1948 @entity120 in the iconic movie " @entity144			0
" from " grease " : go grease lighting , go grease lighting ... @entity77 : the @entity147 in @entity148 , and @entity150 's old @entity149			1
@entity151 and @entity152 , " @entity153 " : @entity155 , our old @entity149 ran great			0
those were the days ... ( @entity156 ) @entity157 @entity158 , @entity23 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity161 's civics classes at @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164			1
where did the word " cyberspace " first appear ? was it in a : a ) movie , b ) book , c ) scientific paper or @entity171 ) magazine article ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! author @entity176 is credited with creating the word in a science fiction novel			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! cybersecurity concerns @entity32 : it may have started as science fiction , but these days , practically all of us , including the government , spend time in cyberspace			1
but president @entity9 says we 're not as prepared as we should be , as a government or a country , for cyber-attacks			1
that 's why he 's planning to create a new position : cybersecurity coordinator			1
@entity194 explains the new job			0
( @entity56 ) @entity196 , @entity58 homeland security correspondent : hackers cut power to a skyscraper and then reprogram it to play @entity201 in a spoof video on @entity203			0
but cybersecurity is not a laughing matter			1
@entity6 president @entity9 : it 's now clear this cyberthreat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation			1
@entity196 : @entity6 use the internet to bank and shop and talk to one another			1
electricity , water , transportation all depend on it			0
but every day , there are attacks			0
the @entity221 estimates in the past two years cybercrime has cost @entity6 more than $ 8 billion			1
and last year alone , hackers stole one trillion dollars worth of business secrets			0
military and intelligence networks have been penetrated , and tests have shown a cyberattack can destroy critical infrastructure , like this generator			0
president @entity9 says the country is not prepared			1
@entity9 : from now on , our digital infrastructure , the networks and computers we depend on every day , will be treated as they should be : as a strategic national asset			1
protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority			0
@entity196 : the president will hand pick a cybersecurity coordinator to integrate policies across government , work closely with the private sector , and coordinate the federal response to attacks			1
still unknown : who will get the job			0
@entity248 , @entity249 : if you get the wrong person , or you put them in an office that does n't have very much power , you can have the best plan in the world and it still wo n't work			0
@entity196 : the plan is short on specifics , though the president says government will not dictate security standards to private industry , and will not monitor private networks or internet traffic			1
security experts say they generally like the steps the administration is taking , but warn there are many more steps to take on the long road to securing the nation 's cyber-infrastructure			1
@entity194 , @entity58 , @entity272			0
( @entity156 ) @entity274 's birthday ! @entity32 : heading across the @entity275 now to celebrate a big @entity277 birthday			1
@entity274 , one of the world 's most famous clocks , turned 150 years old yesterday			1
recently voted as @entity277 's favorite monument , it 's actually just the 14 - ton bell that 's named " @entity274 , " although most people use it describe the tower and clock , too			1
despite a couple disruptions over the years , @entity274 has helped keep @entity287 on time since 1859			1
extra , @entity289 @entity32 : this college baseball game did n't last quite 150 years , but it did go into extra innings ; 16 of them ! @entity293 and @entity294 took the field at 7 p.m. and left it at 2 a.m. after playing the longest game in @entity298 history : 25 innings , almost 3 full games			0
at one point , a relief pitcher threw 13 scoreless innings			0
in the end , an rbi single helped @entity293 triumph , 3 - 2			0
word to the @entity308 @entity309 : a word to the @entity308 ... sustainable ( adjective ) capable of being maintained with minimal long - term effects on the environment source : www.dictionary.com reusable lessons @entity32 : sustainability projects can be as simple as recycling paper and plastic and using recycled materials , or they can be as complex as altering the viscosity of waste oil to convert it into biodiesel fuel			1
there 's one place in @entity325 , @entity326 that 's doing all of this : a school ! @entity329 takes us on a tour of the campus 's environmentally - friendly efforts			1
( @entity56 ) @entity334 , @entity335 : the botany classroom is the great outdoors for students at the @entity339 in @entity325			0
@entity340 , the @entity341 : this is something that we 'll actually use later in life			0
@entity346 : they 're digging in the dirt , getting lessons in environmental sustainability			1
@entity351 : it 's much healthier for you , it 's less chemicals , it 's completely natural and it costs less			2
@entity346 : the school 's organic garden is just the beginning			1
@entity361 , science teacher : the idea that your labor can then nourish you is a life lesson , you know , and the fact that you take responsibility			0
if you do something wrong , you have to fix it			0
@entity346 : food from the garden goes to the cafeteria			0
menus change depending on what 's fresh			2
the dining hall is also trayless , saving thousands of gallons of water used to wash them			0
the cafeteria does more than just cook with sustainability in mind			2
for example , all of the oil that is used for fried foods is ultimately turned into biodiesel			0
that biofuel is used to fill up the school 's maintenance vehicles for half the cost of gas			1
there is even a wind turbine on campus creating electricity			2
but the key is keeping the students involved			0
@entity400 , @entity401 , the @entity341 : it 's really important for us to educate young people to be good citizens for the 21st century			2
@entity406 , the @entity341 : it 's my earth and my water and my air , too , so i dont want anybody trashing it			2
@entity346 : @entity329 , @entity58 , @entity325			0
( @entity156 ) before we go @entity32 : before we go : the answer to one of life 's great mysteries			2
why did the chicken cross the road ? to get a donut ! at least that 's this bird brain 's excuse			2
alright , he 's actually a rooster , but you get it			2
every morning , he 'd hear the opening bell at @entity428 and dash across the street to get his complementary breakfast			0
did heavy traffic ever scare him away from his risky run ? goodbye @entity32 : we already told you , this guy 's no chicken			2
