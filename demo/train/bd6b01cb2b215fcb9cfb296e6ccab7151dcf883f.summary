-- extinctions , droughts , rising sea levels , bigger and more dangerous storm events ; nature has been speaking to us			2
it 's telling us we are taking too much from the planet and saving too little			2
my colleagues and i at @entity11 ( @entity11 ) have been listening and now is the time for the world to act			0
the world 's eyes are on @entity16 this week as both the @entity17 and the @entity18 -- that only happens once every 10 years -- take place			1
both are significant international events whose outcomes will influence millions of lives around the globe for years to come			2
the timing of these two meetings is an opportunity to look into the future to define a sustainable pathway for future generations to responsibly and sustainably care for nature , our global biodiversity , for the well - being of all humanity			1
both events will have a strong focus on improving human well - being and alleviating poverty without undermining environmental processes , natural ecosystems , or compromising our future			1
it 's a tricky balance to strike			0
governments and societies are faced with making difficult short and long - term choices			1
those decisions can result in trade - offs between the provision of energy , food and water security , and creating and sustaining jobs and livelihoods , promoting economic development and conserving biodiversity and our natural areas all under a stabilized global climate			1
people have put tremendous stress on those benefits from nature to support our needs , and moving forward the pressure will only increase as our global population is estimated to increase to nine billion by 2050			0
already we have seen some progress with emissions targets set this week by the @entity71 and @entity72			2
this is a major milestone not only in the @entity71 - @entity72 relationship but in the international climate agenda			2
it will set a new tone in the next round of climate negotiations where we need similar commitments by other industrialized and middle income nations			0
we believe the answer to these challenges is the inclusion of protected areas and other nature - based solutions as an integral part of our economic and development pathways			1
we know , from our projects around the world , that protected areas can provide significant environmental , social and economic benefits without great cost			0
a report from this year 's @entity95 ( @entity95 ) showed that every dollar invested in biodiversity conservation yields a $ 7 dollar return in environmental services , like clean air , food and fresh water provision			0
increasing the number and size of these areas will ensure that essential food , water , energy , genetic diversity and climate securities continue to provide for us and future generations			0
to achieve truly sustainable development , however , we need policies , economic incentives , and practical tools and safeguards			1
more than 15 % of @entity118 's terrestrial areas are now under some type of formal protection			0
more than 12 % is in @entity121 's and @entity122			0
marine protected areas also now cover more than 3 % of the world 's oceans			0
this represents tremendous momentum -- more ambitious than we were willing to hope for even at the last @entity18			1
large scale multi-national initiatives ; such as the @entity129 and the @entity130 have been transformational			0
the @entity129 is a tropical wilderness spanning six countries in @entity132			0
it contains about 25 % of the world 's remaining intact forest which holds vital carbon for climate regulation and produces as much as 10 to15 % of the world 's fresh water			2
the @entity130 , a framework created by @entity143 leaders for sustainable management and conservation , covers 10 % of the world 's total ocean surface and is home to the largest remaining healthy stocks of tuna			1
@entity11 , and hundreds of other non-governmental organizations , governments , businesses , indigenous peoples , local communities and specialists at the @entity18 will work to continue this good work			1
this meeting of the minds has the potential to reconcile long - standing challenges to protect nature , support development and ensure human well - being			1
the outcomes from the @entity18 can serve as a roadmap towards a more sustainable future ; one that has embedded protected areas in the decision - making process for development and has prioritized their role to define and deliver on the world 's @entity173			1
it is our hope that this collective expertise and shared recommendation will provide key insight to the @entity17 leaders and influence their outcomes to ensure global economic development through a green and sustainable pathway			1
this week holds promise as a defining time for our generation and generations to come			2
this is our call to action , now let 's deliver			0
