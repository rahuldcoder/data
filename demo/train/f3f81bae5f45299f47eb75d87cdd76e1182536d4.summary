-- @entity1 was just 3 years old when she participated in her first clinical trial for type 1 diabetes prevention			1
she did n't have the disease , but her 7 - year old sister did and there was concern that she might develop it , too			2
during the trial she was given one shot of insulin a day in the hope that it would stave off the disease , but a year later , she was officially diagnosed			1
" i remember a lot of things changed			2
" i went from having juice every day and @entity15 to not having sugar at all			0
i remember getting shots every day , finger pricks , my parents had to hold me down			0
" @entity20 , she says was difficult			0
" you had to let teachers know what was going on			0
you had a special relationship with the nurse because she had to check your blood sugar every day before going to lunch			0
" at 14 she entered a second trial , this one at the @entity29 , for a continuous glucose monitoring system called the navigator			1
it was at @entity29 that she first learned about the artificial pancreas			1
a high school senior at 18 now , she has participated in four clinical trials and two have involved artificial pancreas systems			1
i 've never done anything quite like it before			0
for the two days that i was on the artificial pancreas i experienced normalcy			1
i was n't checking myself every five seconds and giving myself insulin because it was doing it for me			2
" in type 1 diabetics , the pancreas makes very little or no insulin , a hormone that controls glucose levels , or the amount of sugar in your blood			1
patients must constantly check their levels throughout the day , determine how much insulin they need to lower their blood sugar and administer the proper amount using a pump or syringe			2
drops or spikes in blood sugar can be extremely dangerous			0
if the level is too low -- a condition called hypoglycemia -- patients can experience shakiness , confusion , trouble speaking , seizures , even coma and death			0
a level that is too high -- hyperglycemia -- can cause excessive thirst , frequent urination and cardiac arrhythmia			0
left untreated , hyperglycemia can lead to a number of serious complications including vision loss and nerve damage			0
an artificial pancreas mimics the glucose regulating function of a healthy pancreas			1
the automated device features a sensor that 's placed under the skin that measures blood sugar			2
information from this continuous glucose monitor is sent to a receiver and an insulin pump delivers insulin in controlled amounts			1
a glucose meter calibrates the sensor			2
sophisticated software checks the blood sugar in the body and automatically provides the correct dose of insulin needed at the right time			2
" when you have diabetes , every second you 're thinking about your blood sugar , " says @entity1			0
" you 're wondering if you 're high , if you 're low , if you 're ok , if you 're giving yourself enough insulin , if you 're not giving yourself enough insulin			2
with the artificial pancreas it takes that worry away because it 's doing it for you			1
it lets you know if something 's wrong			0
that way you 're not always worrying about your blood sugar			0
" the device has not yet been approved by the @entity120			1
in june the agency issued a draft guidance seeking input from the industry and researchers on an early version of the artificial pancreas , called the low glucose suspend system			1
it 's a backup for diabetics experiencing hypoglycemia			2
patients still have to monitor their levels and give themselves insulin if necessary , but the low glucose suspend system temporarily reduces or stops the insulin flow in the event of an episode			1
there are two types : a reactive low glucose suspend system that stops insulin infusion when a predetermined level has been reached , and a predictive low glucose suspend system that anticipates a hypoglycemic event based on the current blood sugar level and how fast those levels are falling			1
dr. @entity151 chairs the @entity120 's @entity152 and he is a type 1 diabetic			1
testifying before a @entity155 committee in june , he said the @entity120 is committed to seeing the device come to market but is proceeding with caution			1
" while the potential benefits are enormous , an artificial pancreas system is considered a significant - risk device , meaning it presents a potential for serious risk to the health , safety or welfare of a patient			1
if not properly designed , use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk , because the device controls the administration of insulin without the oversight of health care professionals			1
" the @entity120 is expected to release new guidance for future generations of the artificial pancreas systems on december 1			1
the @entity182 has been working closely with the @entity120 on the artificial pancreas			1
it says low glucose suspend systems have been in use in more than 40 countries for the last 2Â½ years and the process in the @entity190 is taking much too long			2
" here in the @entity190 we 're now almost three years behind and the first study to test these systems is just going to launch in the next month , which means it 's going to be another year or so before patients even have access , " said @entity191 , assistant vice president of treatment therapies for the foundation			0
" what @entity182 is advocating for is to ensure that people here in the @entity190 have access to these tools in a timely manner			0
" the @entity120 says other countries have different regulatory systems in place that do not require the same safety and effectiveness data for a product of this level of risk			1
@entity212 , a 51 - year - old christmas tree farmer and the national director for donor relations at @entity182 was diagnosed eight years ago with type 1 diabetes			1
" i think they 're getting hung up on better when good enough can do the job			0
you ca n't get better until it 's out there being used			0
we know that technology is n't perfect , but what we 're talking about are significant improvements and enhancements over what we have today that can significantly reduce the daily burden of living with this disease , improve quality of lives and save lives			0
" @entity212 has been participating in artificial pancreas clinical trials at @entity29 since 2007			1
" it 's been awesome , fantastic , frankly everything i could ever imagine it to be and then some , " he says			0
" the open question for me was could a computer system using off - the - shelf technologies do a better job of controlling my blood sugar than i was already doing for myself and the answer turned out to be overwhelmingly yes			0
" without it , @entity212 says he has to spend every minute managing his diabetes			0
" i have to be my own pancreas 24 hours a day			2
last thing at night , first thing in the morning and often in the middle of the night			0
when the artificial pancreas took over , that was a real power moment			1
it kept me perfect from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. when the artificial pancreas took over moment to moment when it was actively assisting me in the management of my disease , it was a life changing moment and it was life changing because i did n't have to think about my diabetes every moment of the day			1
" dr. @entity262 is an endocrinologist and director of the @entity264 at @entity265 in @entity266 " the data from other countries showed that the system could be used safely and effectively			0
it 's been somewhat disappointing that it has taken so long to get approval here			0
" she says the long awaited system offers hope to patients			0
" for people with type 1 diabetes , the artificial pancreas has been kind of the holy grail of technology to support self management of diabetes			1
it 's not going to cure it , but it 's going to be a huge step in the right direction			0
once it 's approved and can be used it will be fantastic			2
" according to the @entity182 , about 80 people a day are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes			1
approximately 3 million @entity190 are living with the disease			0
most of them only have healthy blood sugars 30 % of the day			2
the foundation says it has spent $ 1.5 billion on diabetes research , $ 40 million of that on research on artificial pancreas systems			1
" our goal is to drive the development of artificial pancreas systems , " @entity191 said			1
" this could not only improve tremendously glucose control , and help reduce the risk of these terrible diabetes complications , it could also help people with diabetes live easier			2
the bottom line is diabetes is a 24 hour a day , 7 day a week , 365 day a year job and if we can make some of that easier that would be a huge step forward			0
" i think it 's superimportant , i think next to having a cure for diabetes it 's the big thing			0
because it 's such an instrumental piece of equipment it can allow you to live closer to what we consider normal than anything that we have now			0
