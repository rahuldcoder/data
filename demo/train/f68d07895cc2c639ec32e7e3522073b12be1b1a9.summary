-- arguably the best fake newsman on television , comedian @entity1 knows how to deliver a one - liner			1
but his invitation to testify before the @entity6 on immigration was the real joke			1
speaker @entity9 cited @entity1 's " ability to bring attention to an important issue like immigration " in declaring the hearing appropriate			1
this helps explain why voters may ensure she is fired as speaker in november			0
she simply does n't get it			0
does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue ? ever since @entity26 and other states began addressing immigration on their own , there has been no shortage of media attention			1
the fact that @entity33 has failed to do its fundamental job of adequately securing the borders and enforcing the law is lost on no one			1
the real question is : what is @entity33 doing to fix it ? the answer : nothing			1
in the 21 months i have served on the @entity44 , we have met 11 times			0
not once have we marked up what i would consider a substantive bill to address meaningfully our current immigration policy			0
although i have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee			0
instead , we have considered private relief bills and extensions of the status quo and discussed procedural issues			0
partisanship is not the problem			0
one of the resolutions i sponsored had 12 republicans and 10 @entity62 on board as original co-sponsors and now has over 60 co-sponsors			2
the resolution would make @entity68 mandatory for all employers , provide sufficient border infrastructure and manpower ; and reject amnesty and any legal status that pardons those here in violation of our laws			0
somehow , the @entity33 has n't found time to discuss that legislation , either			1
instead , the @entity62 brought in @entity1			1
i skipped the @entity1 hearing and returned to @entity81 to attend the viewing of a @entity81 soldier who was killed in @entity84			2
as much as i enjoy the comedy of @entity1 , i do n't believe @entity86 is the place to watch it			1
the entire fiasco only highlights the fact that during a time when @entity62 control the @entity6 , the @entity92 and the presidency , the @entity90 has done virtually nothing			2
meaningful action on immigration reform has been paralyzed in part by broad disagreement over the issue of " amnesty " @entity100 center on what constitutes amnesty and whether current proposals by advocates for legalization of illegal immigrants represent an amnesty akin to what passed in 1986			2
but there is plenty of common ground on other immigration issues			0
most of us on the subcommittee would agree that we need to fix legal immigration			0
it can take decades to get through the process legally			0
that does n't work for anyone			0
if the @entity1 hearing was an attempt to distract voters from recognizing how little has actually been done , the strategy backfired			1
voters live every day with the consequences of how little has been done			2
they deserve leadership in @entity33 that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			2

rep. @entity133 that inviting comedian to testify was a distraction
@entity9 's claim that @entity1 would draw attention to issue shows she does n't get it , he says
he says @entity62 - controlled @entity33 has done nothing to solve immigration issue
@entity133 : voters living with consequences of *inaction* ; they deserve leadership , not comedy
