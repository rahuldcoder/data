-- young golf star @entity1 has turned his back on the @entity3 and decided to focus on playing in @entity4 next year , revealing that he feels " lonely " when on the @entity6 circuit			1
the 21 - year - old , who won his first @entity3 title at @entity9 in may , will follow @entity11 teammate and new world no. 1 @entity12 in concentrating on the @entity14			1
" sometimes you feel as though you have to be in @entity6 just to play the mandatory 15 and , at the start of this year , that was something i really wanted to do , " he told reporters in @entity16 , according to reuters.com			2
" i did that , but i also realized it was n't for me -- but then it does n't mean to say that i do n't want to play fulltime in the @entity25 again			2
" the world no. 9 qualified for the lucrative @entity28 playoffs in his rookie year in the @entity6 as he earned more than $ 2.5 million in prize money and finished 26th overall			1
" i found myself in @entity6 -- especially in the @entity28 play - off series -- just not wanting to be there , especially on the golf course , " the @entity32 said			1
" i switched on the @entity35 and began watching the @entity36 in @entity37 and thinking to myself i would rather be there instead			0
" it would be easier if i had a place in the @entity25 , and that would definitely make it easier to play both tours			0
besides , with the majors and the @entity45 , plus a few other events such as my defense of the @entity48 , i will still play 11 or 12 there next year , and i will be happy with that			0
" @entity1 said he made his decision before @entity14 officials increased the minimum number of tournaments required for full membership to 13			1
" but that does make it more difficult , " he said			0
" besides , i enjoy my time too much back at home			0
@entity59 [ his girlfriend ] also has another two years at university and we have two dogs , a nice house and i love my life back in @entity66 , back in @entity4 and i do n't want ever to give that up			0
" but if i keep playing the way i have been playing , i will get all the invitations i need			0
also after playing the @entity11 , i got a great sense of the camaraderie out there , and i got to know many of the @entity4 guys a lot better			0
" the thing is that if you are playing well in the @entity25 , it 's a great place to be , but if you 're not it can be a lonely place			0
whereas if you are not playing well on the @entity14 you still have plenty of mates to hang out with			2
" @entity1 has decided to skip this week 's @entity80 , where @entity11 teammate @entity81 will defend his title , and instead focus on retaining his own @entity84 crown later this month			1
@entity85 will be up against the @entity14 's leading money - winners , @entity87 and @entity88 , plus sunday 's @entity90 winner @entity89			1
former world no. 1 @entity91 will defend his @entity94 masters title in @entity95 this week , with the field also featuring @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99			2
home hopes include two - time champion @entity102 , former @entity104 champion @entity103 and @entity105 .			1

@entity1 will return to the @entity14 as a full member next *season*
@entity32 had played fulltime for his rookie year on @entity3 in 2010
the 21 - year - old says he misses being at home with his friends and family
