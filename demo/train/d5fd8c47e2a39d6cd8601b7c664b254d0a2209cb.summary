@entity2 is one of the biggest whistle - blowers in @entity5 history , and his case is one of the @entity10 administration 's unprecedented seven prosecutions against national security and intelligence whistleblowers			1
his disclosures to @entity14 revealed war crimes and torture -- topics that are surely in the public 's interest to know			1
the fact that the mainstream media around the world reprinted the bulk of his disclosures is evidence of the clear value in knowing what our government is doing			0
@entity2 was sentenced to 35 years , but should have been sentenced to time served already : 3Â½ years , 112 days of which was improper pretrial detention , also known as torture			1
he suffered prolonged solitary confinement and was forced to be naked			0
@entity2 's trial was sparsely covered by the mainsteam media			2
the alternative media outlets who did cover the story comprehensively were faced with unprecedented secrecy , so much so that for months of pretrial proceedings , none of the court pleadings was publicly available			0
@entity5 should be better than secret courts and the criminalization of whistleblowing			2
the military prosecutors asked the judge to lock @entity2 up for 60 years in order to " send a message			1
" sending a message has everything to do with politics and nothing to do with justice			0
although it was not the 60 years that the government asked for , @entity2 's 35 - year sentence is still clearly intended to send a message for his conduct -- conduct that provided the public with evidence of clear wrongdoing and did no harm to the @entity5			1
the wrongdoers whose crimes manning exposed enjoyed far gentler fates			0
like @entity2 , my whistleblower clients , former @entity72 executive @entity71 , who exposed warrantless wiretapping ; and former @entity75 officer @entity74 , who exposed his agency 's use of torture , were charged under the @entity79			1
unlike @entity2 , they were not convicted under that act , although @entity74 is serving out a 30 - month prison sentence			2
as in @entity2 's case , the only person to be truly punished was the whistleblower			2
@entity71 and @entity74 helped expose two of the biggest scandals of the post- 9/11 era , yet they are the only two people criminally prosecuted in connection with them			0
the message is clear : it is safer for a government employee to violate the @entity91 or to torture detainees or to gun down apparent civilians , as seen in the " collateral murder " video that @entity2 released to @entity14			1
( that classified video shows a @entity5 @entity99 helicopter firing on a group of people in @entity102 in 2007 who do not return fire			2
two of those killed were @entity106 ' employees ; two children were severely injured			0
an @entity109 investigation found the crew followed the rules of engagement )			0
@entity2 's harsh sentence and the government 's despotic desire to " send a message " represents yet another dismal step toward secrecy from a presidential administration that once pledged to be the " most transparent in history			1
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 and @entity123 .			0
