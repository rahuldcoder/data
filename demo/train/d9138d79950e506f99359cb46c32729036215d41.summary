-- @entity1 , star of the @entity3 series " csi : @entity10 , " founded the @entity5 to empower young people through mentoring , scholarship and grant programs			1
@entity1 , who is also a best - selling author and a graduate of @entity12 and the @entity13 , served on the @entity14 that selected this year 's @entity16 @entity15			1
he recently spoke to @entity0 about the @entity15 campaign and his philanthropy			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity0 : why did you decide to name your organization the @entity5 ? @entity1 : well , the name comes from the subtitle of my first book [ " @entity28 " ] and so what i wanted to do was take some of the profits from that and create this foundation			1
i started to find that a lot of our young people just do n't have mentors			1
they do n't have individuals to help them navigate their journey			0
" manifest your destiny " means what it is : if you have a dream , if you have a goal , let 's figure out how to get you there			0
the foundation started in 2005 , and to date we 've had 120 kids go through the program			0
but we 've had nearly 2,000 kids be touched by the program , whether it 's us going out and speaking to groups of kids and donating books or having them come to our toy drives and then getting some kind of lessons			0
@entity0 : one of your programs specifically targets teens between eighth and ninth grades			0
why is that ? @entity1 : i 'm very proud of the @entity67 because , if you look at the data with the dropout rates , a lot of times you can predict who 's not going to make it through high school			1
an eighth - grader , coming out with a 2.8 [ grade - point average ] or below , their chance of dropping out of high school -- if you 're a male , particularly an @entity82 male -- is almost 80 percent			2
and so we want to catch these kids who are potentially falling through the cracks as they make this transition , to really bolster their foundation for getting through high school and getting on to college			0
it 's free to all the students			0
right now it 's in @entity93 alone , but we 're looking to expand it nationally			2
@entity0 : did you have any mentors who helped you succeed ? @entity1 : my father , obviously , and my mother were inspirations			1
my uncle , @entity1 , he was an absolute mentor for me			1
i had a professor in college , professor @entity101 , he pushed me			0
he said i was n't working hard enough even though i was doing well , and he said : " @entity104 is n't good enough			0
we want you to excel			0
we want you to be excellent			0
" so i had people who really pushed me , and most of us , we either rise or fall based on the expectations that are placed upon us			2
and i think there 's too many of our young people out there where we 're not expecting enough of them			1
and even when we look in the mirror , oftentimes we 're expecting less and less of ourselves			1
and so what 's that about ? so i really am in that camp of " let 's go for it			0
" let 's go big			0
dream big , and then double your dreams , and you still have n't dreamed big enough			0
@entity0 : turning to @entity15 , what was it like being on the @entity14 ? @entity1 : i really enjoyed it			1
it was very humbling but at the same time inspiring , because everyone -- even the individuals that were n't ultimately chosen [ for the @entity16 ] -- were very inspiring			0
it reinforces that there are so many out there doing good things for others that you 'd never know about or hear about			0
that 's why @entity15 is a very special and a much - needed thing			1
@entity0 : you 've been to " @entity15 : an all - star tribute " before			1
how does it compare to other awards shows you 've been to ? @entity1 : i love it because you get into @entity145 awards season and oftentimes it feels like @entity145 is giving @entity145 awards			1
this is giving out awards to people who are n't connected in any way shape or form to @entity145 or anything like that -- there 's no nepotism or old - boy or old - girl network			2
we are literally celebrating what 's best and what 's right , people who are serving others			2
i just really enjoyed being there			0
@entity0 : why is it important to recognize everyday people changing the world ? @entity1 : because at the end of the day , that 's the only way the world is going to change			1
@entity171 happens from the bottom up -- all of us as individuals deciding that we will and we do have an impact			1
we 've just come through voting season , and so many people think , " my vote does n't matter			2
" what if the people who are @entity15 felt that way : " i ca n't change the world			1
" these people prove that no matter how much you have or do n't have , you can have a positive impact and better the human condition and this world so we all win			2
their image just reminds us of that and challenges me to be a better person			0
@entity0 : what is a hero to you ? @entity1 : for me , it 's someone who is living with courage			1
the root is ' cor ' which means heart , and to me all of the @entity15 represent courage because they are living from the heart			2
and that 's what they inspire me to do .			2

@entity1 is *encouraging* youth through his @entity207
the " csi : @entity10 " star says we 're not expecting enough out of young people these days
@entity1 says @entity15 inspire him to be better : " @entity171 happens from the bottom up "
