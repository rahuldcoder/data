-- @entity1 likes to talk the talk but how did the @entity0 anchor fare when he had to walk the walk and face a cricket ball coming towards him at 150 kilometers an hour ? @entity1 , who likes to tweet from the lip , has been one of @entity9 's most outspoken critics over the past few weeks following the team 's embarrassing capitulation against @entity12 in the fiercely contested @entity14 series			1
and from the cosy surroundings of his @entity17 home , @entity1 took to @entity18 to criticize @entity9 's wretched batting in the first three @entity20 -- matches in which @entity12 cruised to victory			1
but on friday in @entity23 , where @entity9 are playing @entity12 in the fourth test , @entity1 got a taste of what the touring batsmen have had to contend with over the last few weeks , though none of them were dumped onto their backside -- unlike the @entity0 anchor			1
facing former @entity33 fast bowler @entity32 , a man who took 310 wickets in 76 tests , @entity1 was pummeled during a six - ball blast			1
with @entity32 not holding back , @entity1 gave the appearance of a rabbit caught in the headlights as he backed away from nearly every delivery			1
watch @entity1 's ordeal on @entity42 on four occasions the @entity43 was hit on the body , while he was also clean bowled by @entity32 much to the amusement of the watching crowd of 2,000 , which included @entity33 cricketers @entity49 and @entity51			1
" he got hurt but he did n't get maimed , so that 's a positive step , " @entity32 told the @entity52			2
" you have to give full credit to the guy -- he 's going to be really sore tomorrow			0
" but he kept on going , so you have to take your hat off to the guy			0
" the biggest smile around the ground was from @entity49 i think			0
i looked over at @entity62 and he gave me a wink , he was quite chuffed			0
" if the 48 - year - old @entity1 was bloodied , he remained unbowed after his bruising experience			1
" it 's made me reassess what you need out here on an @entity14 tour and that is courage , fortitude and a churchillian spirit of never giving in despite overwhelming odds , " he said			0
@entity0 digital writer @entity75 plays amateur cricket with @entity1 , so what was his analysis of his teammate 's performance ? " having played cricket with @entity1 on numerous occasions , it 's well known he has two shots : a forward defense and a heave to the leg side , " said @entity75			1
" sadly , he was n't able to exhibit either			0
" charging down the wicket at someone bowling nearly 150 kph is n't brave , it 's just plain stupid			0
but @entity1 deserves full marks for the guts he showed in the face of a relentless barrage from @entity32			2
" the sight of any batsman backing away from his stumps is a sign he 's troubled by the pace of the bowler , but in this case it was probably a wise idea to prevent his chin being shattered			0
" a still head , straight bat and balance are the fundamentals of batting -- sadly for @entity1 , none of those elements were on show in @entity23			2
thankfully though , he is still alive to tell the tale			0
" the @entity9 players who were the subject of @entity1 's @entity18 angst did at least return to form friday to take control of the fourth test at the @entity117			1
their nemesis @entity49 took five wickets to leave @entity9 255 all out , but the visitors hit back to have the home side reeling on 167 for nine at stumps and facing the prospect of defeat after three earlier easy victories			2
in @entity127 , fast bowler @entity126 put on a display that @entity32 at his best would be proud of , taking six wickets for 100 runs as @entity131 were all out for 334 in their first innings in @entity134			2
retiring legend @entity135 became only the second man in @entity138 history to take 200 catches during the course of the second day .			0

@entity0 anchor @entity1 went head to head with @entity33 bowler @entity32
@entity1 left flat on his backside at @entity117
the 48 - year - old anchor hit four times in six deliveries
@entity9 fight back in fourth test to take control on second day
