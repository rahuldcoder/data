-- i still remember the chill that came over me the day my middle school history teacher showed the class a documentary about the @entity7			2
millions of @entity8 were systematically isolated , corralled and eventually murdered by the @entity10 regime			2
it 's a horrible blemish on the history of mankind , one that is rarely brought up lightly			2
it 's one that is recognized in museums , dramatized in film and taught in middle schools like the one i went to nearly 30 years ago			2
and yet , despite my continuous exposure to the retelling of the @entity7 , it was n't until i was in my mid- 20s that i learned @entity25 had also isolated , corralled and murdered gay men and lesbians during this time as well			2
right now i can hear the voices ask : what does it matter ? i had graduated from high school before i learned some of the greatest voices during the @entity35 and civil rights movement -- @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 -- were members of the @entity41 community			1
it was in graduate school when i first heard the name @entity45			0
i was a working journalist before i was told about @entity46 , the former @entity47 running back who came out in his 1977 autobiography , " the @entity51			0
" and now the chorus of voices ask : so what ? over the years , i am proud to say i have amassed a decent personal library			0
most of the books are about history : presidential biographies , wars , social justice movements			0
and yet , it was only this week -- thanks to longtime civil rights activist @entity64 -- that i learned @entity65 once debated passing a law forcing gay men to wear tattoos and corralling those who were @entity69 positive into internment camps			1
yes , just like the @entity8			0
just like the gay men who were next to those jews in @entity10 but have since disappeared from our history books			1
it is here where the cynic wonders : who needs to know ? with the overturning of " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the sweeping changes in marriage equality , the presence of open @entity41 people working in the @entity87 , on tv , even in professional sports , there may be some who believe the heart of homophobia no longer beats			1
much in the same way others believed the burning of bras slayed sexism and the election of president @entity96 was racism 's death knell			0
one of the most powerful ceos on the planet has announced he is a proud gay man , and while i may be hesitant to characterized @entity106 's @entity105 proclamation " brave , " it is nonetheless important			1
just as @entity36 and @entity38 and @entity45 were there -- working for the greater good , changing the course of global history , woven into the fabric of humanity			0
the voices may ask : what difference does it make ? let the absence of @entity41 people in our retelling of our history be the reply			1
for if being gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender truly did not matter , why then must we fight to have our contributions recognized ? why then , when @entity125 became the first state to require our stories be included in the history books , was it met with resistance in 2011 ? that conservative state assemblyman @entity130 described the day the bill was signed into law " sad " as if simply learning that a group of people existed infringed upon his constitutional rights			1
to be honest , @entity105 's announcement is no great shock to anyone who has been paying attention to the rumor mill. but by owning his truth in such a public fashion , @entity105 is not only rebuking the tendency many @entity41 baby boomers still have to hide , but he is also refusing to allow his silence to render him hidden			1
when the middle school history teachers speak of him , they will have his full story to share			1
going forward , chants of " who cares ? " will accompany nearly every person of note who chooses to come out publicly			0
even among @entity41 people , shoulder shrugs will not be that uncommon , as if debates about internment camps happened in the 1880s and not the 1980s			1
yes , the country is different , and being gay is no longer shocking			0
but it is a mistake to confuse that progress with @entity105 's announcement having no importance			1
for far too long , the story of the lgbt community has been scrubbed from our education , contributions erased and existence relegated to the poorly lit corner of bookstores under the banner " @entity171			2
" we are not a " lifestyle			0
" we are a people , and we were there			0
and we are here .			0

@entity175 was an adult when he learned gay people were also @entity10 *victims*
he also learned key members of the @entity35 , civil rights movement were @entity41
why does it matter ? @entity175 says it 's crucial gay people not be scrubbed from history
it 's important to know the full story of people such as @entity106 ceo @entity105 , he says
