@entity0 -- two influential @entity3 senators introduced a resolution tuesday expressing support for limited @entity3 involvement in the @entity8 - led military campaign in @entity9 -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure in the @entity13 to withdraw backing for the mission			1
meanwhile , house speaker @entity16 proposed two resolutions on the @entity9 mission that could come up for votes on thursday			1
one would be the same as the @entity22 resolution introduced tuesday , and the other would limit @entity3 involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by @entity3 forces to continue			1
the @entity13 proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in @entity33 over what @entity16 and others call president @entity37 's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the @entity39 for engaging @entity3 forces in the @entity9 military campaign			1
" if the commander - in - chief believes that intervention in @entity9 is important for our national security , he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization , " @entity16 said in a statement announcing the two proposed @entity13 resolutions			1
" in the three months since military action in @entity9 began , none of this has occurred			0
the @entity3 people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate , and @entity33 has a responsibility to hold the @entity59 accountable			1
" the @entity22 resolution , introduced by @entity62 democrat @entity61 and @entity65 @entity64 @entity63 , authorizes the commitment of @entity3 forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of @entity3 ground troops			1
" i believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster , " @entity63 said			0
" i believe we will find a strong , bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in @entity9 and seeing this mission through to success			2
" @entity61 added , " by supporting this resolution , we tell @entity81 young and old that the @entity3 is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom			1
" the allied military effort , which already has formal @entity88 support , was launched to protect @entity9 civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the @entity94 country 's longtime ruler , @entity92			2
@entity96 leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without @entity92 's ouster			0
the @entity37 administration has already promised not to use @entity3 ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting			2
an unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war @entity104 and conservative @entity64 worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance			0
one of the @entity13 resolutions under consideration will be the same as the @entity63 - @entity61 proposal that supports the current limited @entity3 role in the mission , @entity16 , @entity114 , said in a statement			1
a @entity13 @entity64 leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated			0
the second @entity13 resolution would remove @entity3 forces from hostilities in @entity9 , except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue ; aerial refueling ; operational planning ; intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; and noncombat missions			1
while the resolution would be nonbinding , its approval by the @entity13 would signal strong opposition to @entity37 's decision to commit @entity3 forces without seeking authorization from @entity33			1
a @entity13 leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at @entity3 military drones and any other combat role by @entity3 forces in @entity9 , and is likely to pass in the @entity64 - controlled chamber			1
@entity13 @entity64 will meet wednesday to further discuss the issue , and @entity64 leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions			0
critics contend the 1973 @entity39 gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending @entity3 forces to war , followed by a 30 - day extension to end hostilities			1
the combined 90 - day period ended sunday			0
support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by @entity92 's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent @entity8 airstrikes			2
@entity8 officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the @entity9 opposition			1
the @entity59 argues the president did n't need congressional authorization because @entity3 forces are playing only a supporting role in @entity9 and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities			1
@entity37 , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the @entity173 and the @entity175 's @entity174 , according to a saturday report in the @entity177			0
in the @entity22 , majority leader @entity178 , @entity179 , and minority leader @entity180 , @entity181 , have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses			0
@entity178 said tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the @entity63 - @entity61 resolution in the @entity189 , but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the @entity22 floor			1
he indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week			0
@entity196 , meanwhile , told reporters that " we all anticipate that there will be some kind of @entity9 debate in the @entity22 in the near future			0
" @entity63 has expressed anger that the @entity59 did n't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war			1
the senator , who ran against @entity37 in 2008 , contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when @entity8 first intervened			2
" the administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the @entity3 people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive , " @entity63 said tuesday			2
" the unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full - scale revolt ... that is occurring in the @entity13			2
" the @entity13 is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week , and liberal rep. @entity219 , @entity220 , intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission			2
however , that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the @entity13 returns from its @entity226 recess			0
to prevent a similar resolution from @entity219 from passing earlier , @entity16 pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send @entity33 information justifying the @entity3 strategy in @entity9			1
@entity37 responded with a 32 - page report arguing in part that he has not violated the @entity39			0
even if the @entity64 - controlled @entity13 passes measures intended to limit funding for the @entity9 mission , it is unlikely the @entity22 would do the same			1
" the president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in @entity9 , but i will be no part of an effort to defund @entity9 or to try to cut off our efforts to bring @entity92 down , " conservative sen. @entity237 , @entity181 - @entity238 , told @entity248 's " @entity247 " on sunday			2
@entity37 " needs to step up his game with @entity9 , but @entity33 should sort of shut up and not empower @entity92 , " @entity237 argued			0
in march , the @entity22 unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no - fly zone over @entity9			2
some @entity64 , however , have now expressed opposition to that effort , citing growing concerns about its cost			0
in its report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through june 3 was about $ 800 million			0
it estimated the total cost through september 30 would be $ 1.1 billion			0
questions about the war 's financial and other costs have also been raised in the @entity269 , which has played a leading role in the @entity8 effort			0
@entity269 prime minister @entity272 insists that @entity269 's military involvement in the @entity94 country can continue " as long as we need			0
" @entity1 's @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0

critics say the @entity59 has n't complied with the @entity39
