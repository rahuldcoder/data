but when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film , it was forever			0
" breakfast at @entity38 " @entity40 's original 1958 novella was n't exactly a love story , so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation			1
( for one thing , he 'd wanted @entity45 to play @entity46			0
) but audiences adored this stylish film , particularly for the final scene , in which @entity46 ( @entity50 ) and @entity52 ( @entity51 ) make a rainy @entity55 alley seem as romantic as any pink - streaked sunset			0
@entity0 : the most stylish celebrity couples " when @entity58 " this 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a ( still - raging ) debate as to whether men and women could " really " be friends -- but it was the pair 's @entity65 reconciliation that moved viewers to tears			1
as @entity76 ( @entity77 ) told @entity78 ( @entity79 ) : " i came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone , you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible			1
" " @entity80 " " i do n't kiss on the mouth , " @entity81 ( @entity82 ) warns @entity83 ( @entity84 ) at the beginning of this 1990 movie			1
so when she does , it 's pivotal -- the audience understands that she 's come to regard @entity83 as much more than a client			1
but even that kiss ca n't beat the one at the happy ending , after @entity93 on her fire escape and she promises to " rescue him right back			1
" @entity0 : @entity82 's transformation " ghost " technically , in this scene from the 1990 film , @entity101 ( @entity102 ) is making out with @entity103 ( @entity104 )			0
but because @entity106 is channeling @entity101 's late boyfriend @entity107 ( @entity108 ) , it 's @entity107 that @entity101 -- and the viewers -- get to see			0
" titanic " director @entity111 initially planned to cast " an @entity50 type " to play the female lead in this 1997 epic , and @entity115 nearly turned down his role			0
it 's still captivating to see him woo @entity119 's @entity118 , even if , as @entity115 said in a recent interview , kissing @entity119 is " like kissing a family member			1
" @entity0 : @entity119 's transformation " @entity123 " the upside down kiss that @entity123 ( @entity126 ) shared with @entity127 ( @entity128 ) in this 2002 flick was breath - taking for @entity126 , but not for the reasons you might think			2
" the whole time i had rainwater running up my nose , " he said			0
" then , when @entity128 rolled back the mask , she cut my air off completely			0
" " @entity136 " it was easy to see why @entity138 ( @entity139 ) was so hung up on his childhood friend @entity140 ( @entity141 )			0
