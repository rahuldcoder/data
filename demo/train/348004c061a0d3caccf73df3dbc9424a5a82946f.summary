-- sumptuous restaurant meals are one of the decadent pleasures of traveling			0
but there are times -- say , after a long day of exploring or business meetings -- when the idea of eating dinner in a bathrobe seems equally compelling			0
happily , now that many of the world 's top hotels offer five - star room service , there 's no need to sacrifice haute cuisine for comfort			1
once considered the last resort of weary business travelers ( and the subject of @entity23 ' comedy ) , room - service dining has finally come into its own			1
gone are the days when hotel guests could expect only defrosted seafood and soggy breakfast pastries on their trays ; now , sophisticated dishes made with artisanal ingredients are making their way upstairs			2
some are even whipped up by superstar chefs ; at @entity36 's @entity35 , for instance , guests can order sublime @entity39 - @entity38 dishes from @entity40 , the ground - floor restaurant run by @entity42 ( of @entity40 fame )			1
among the many other room - service treats you wo n't need to lift a finger to enjoy ( unless that finger is helping to hold a fork ) are lunchtime specialties like wagyu - pastrami sandwiches ( at the @entity51 in @entity52 ) and custom - mixed cocktails ( at the @entity54 )			2
the delivery is as memorable as the food at @entity57 in @entity58 , where servers light candles , uncork wine and dim the lights for a private romantic dinner			0
the @entity64 , though , may well be at @entity65 , a @entity67 getaway , where ukulele - strumming canoeists deliver breakfast to guests ' overwater bungalows			1
restaurateurs , beware ... eating in is the new eating out			0
@entity0 : wonderful hotel libraries @entity35 ( @entity36 ) known for its in - house art collection ( more than 500 works are displayed in the guest rooms and common areas ) , the @entity74 is similarly famous for the culinary artistry whipped up by its resident chef , @entity42			1
@entity40 , on the ground floor of the hotel , is the only midtown outpost of @entity42 's @entity86 restaurant empire			2
order a plate of steamed buns -- filled either with lobster ; maitake mushrooms and chicarrón ( pork rinds ) ; or black - bass tartare and gooseberries -- and you 'll understand why @entity42 's wizardry has won multiple @entity98 awards in recent years			1

as if waking up each morning surrounded by the turquoise water of @entity160 were n't stunning enough , having your breakfast pancakes and tropical fruit delivered to your private deck -- by a strumming ukulele player in a canoe -- is sheer heaven			0

@entity0 : @entity170 's best medical spas @entity171 ( @entity172 , @entity173 ) though originally built in 1851 as a prison , this stately building ( converted to a hotel in 2007 ) is now a place where guests feel grateful to do time			1

the @entity196 ( @entity52 , @entity197 ) sure , the in - room dining at this boutique @entity200 retreat is decadent ( how about a pre-ski breakfast of lemon - ricotta soufflé pancakes with homemade raspberry syrup ? )			1
but for get - up - and - go types , who like to partake in hotel activities like horseback riding and mountaintop yoga , the folks at @entity51 go the extra mile : their kitchen staff will pack a gourmet picnic lunch to take along , with options like local @entity216 pastrami on rye or faro salad with nuts and pomegranates			0
