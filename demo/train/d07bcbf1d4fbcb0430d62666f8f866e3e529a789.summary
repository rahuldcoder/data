-- the way some @entity3 talk about the @entity4 , you would think it was created by a bunch of pot - smoking hippies communing at a nudist camp in northern @entity8 -- when in fact , the @entity4 was created by one of their own , @entity10 , in 1970			1
much as @entity3 do n't like to bring up the huge tax increases instituted by their hero , @entity13 , they prefer to sidestep their role in the @entity4 's humble beginnings and blame it on @entity16			1
they characterize the whole thing as an albatross hanging around the economy 's neck			2
to be fair , @entity10 did not ride into the @entity21 as a conservationist , and he did veto the @entity23			2
but he said he did so because of the price tag of the policy , not its purpose			2
after the @entity28 oil spill in 1969 -- which at the time was the largest in @entity32 history -- @entity10 agreed with the rest of thinking society that clean water and air were a good thing			2
and his fingerprints are all over such tree - hugging initiatives as the @entity40			2
sadly , if he tried any of that funny business today , his own party would probably impeach him			0
that 's how far down the oil well some in the @entity3 leadership have fallen			1
rep. @entity46 said she would lock the @entity4 's doors and turn off its lights if she were president ( thankfully there 's no chance of that ) ; @entity53 said he would shut down the @entity4 and create a replacement to work with businesses to create jobs ( making it more of a lapdog than watchdog ) ; @entity60 asked the president to halt all regulations , adding " his @entity4 regulations are killing jobs all across @entity32			1
" many conservatives , such as @entity46 and @entity60 , refer to the agency as a " job killer " because of the regulations , and consequent operational costs , it imposes on businesses			0
i find the label rather odd , considering that research shows that poor air and water quality are people killers and without people , jobs are pretty much useless			0
the @entity78 , a 120 - year - old conservation nonprofit , estimates that legislation administered by the @entity4 prevented more than 200,000 premature deaths from air pollutants , cleaned more than 2000 polluted rivers and lakes , and was instrumental in phasing out dangerous chemicals such as @entity85 and pcbs along with the poisonous leaded gasoline -- one of the worse inventions of all time , according to @entity91			1
that does n't mean it 's an agency without controversy			0
the @entity78 , in pushing for more progress , often criticizes the @entity4 for its shortcomings , and the agency was accused of suppressing a report that questions global warming			1
still , how could anyone who has seen news coverage of the 2010 @entity103 spill -- the current worst oil disaster in @entity32 history -- not want the federal government involved in protecting the environment ? @entity4 critics such as @entity109 suggest the states should be left to handle their own environmental issues -- an idea that could only come from people who have not had to stand in line at the @entity115			1
once you 've dealt with that and other state offices , the last thing you would want is to let the states go solo in handling the safety of drinking water			0
and who did front - runner @entity123 cite to say that the @entity4 functioned better under @entity126 than @entity127 ? oil and gas executives			1
talk about a classic example of someone completely lacking in the self - awareness department			0
i guess for his next piece of news he 'll tell us evangelical voters believe in @entity138			0
seriously , if @entity123 is so hell - bent on stating the obvious , he should bring up the provision in @entity126 's 2005 @entity140 that excused natural gas companies from telling the @entity4 which chemicals they were using to mine with , and say it was a mistake			1
it 's not like that would be stepping out on a limb , since it 's been well documented that some people who live near gas - drilling facilities can now turn on their faucets and light the water on fire			0
i 'm not making that up -- rent the documentary " @entity155 " and enjoy the pyrotechnic show			0
i found myself getting angry as i listened to homeowner after homeowner share the details of trying to live a life breathing in toxic fumes because of the unregulated drilling			0
or better yet , think @entity166 , the driving force behind @entity169 's energy policy			0
why @entity166 ? well , one of the companies making big profits from the natural gas drilling is his former employer , @entity174			0
and yet @entity3 like @entity123 -- who as a governor , proposed plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , and as a presidential candidate , backed away from such plans -- and his rivals talk openly about their disdain for the @entity4 , while pushing for the @entity182 pipeline extension			1
the pros and cons of building a system that funnels crude oil into the @entity32 are worth exploring			0
but doing so while plotting to dismantle the @entity4 reeks of capitalism run amok			1
i severely doubt the @entity4 is running as efficiently as it should , and i 'm sure there are some regulations that need to reviewed by the science community			2
but the @entity3 notion that a federal policing of our natural resources is a waste of money flies in the face of common sense			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity3 candidates have sharply criticized @entity4 , called for it to be limited or shut down
@entity205 says they *'re* ignoring the fact that it was created by a @entity3 president
the @entity4 is *credited* with administering laws that have saved many lives , he says
@entity205 : *ending* a federal role in enforcing environmental rules makes no sense
