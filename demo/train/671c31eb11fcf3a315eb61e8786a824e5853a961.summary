-- never has the @entity1 said so much when saying so little			0
when the justices refused to rule on gay marriage cases monday , it directly cleared the way for the unions to become legal in five states -- @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
a sixth state , @entity14 , began allowing same - sex marriages tuesday morning , with the state 's high court throwing out the last remaining legal obstacles in the wake of the @entity21 @entity1 's decision			1
and experts believe five other states -- @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity11 , and @entity27 -- will soon follow			2
add them all up and the likely bottom line appears : same - sex marriage will be legal in 30 states in the near future , many believe			1
those states represent more than half of the country and well over half the nation 's population			0
and gay couples in those states will be able to wed legally			2
" now we are in a situation where 30 states have same - sex marriage , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity41 said			1
" when you have that many people living in a world where same - sex marriage is legal , ( it ) makes it inevitable , it seems , that the rest of the country will follow			1
" for now , though , there are 20 other states that are n't budging			0
nearly all of them are in the @entity57 and @entity25			0
that 's no surprise , as these swaths of the country have traditionally been socially conservative			0
already , @entity25 's attorney general has said he will continue fighting to keep the state 's ban in place			2
so , what 's next in the gay marriage fight for those states ? same - sex marriage advocates say they plan to work both the statehouses and the courthouses there			1
opinion : how @entity1 's non-decision helps gay marriage politics and the personal gay conservatives are undertaking the most coordinated effort yet to change the @entity79 's position on same - sex marriage			1
their approach : one state and one @entity79 activist at a time			0
the official stance of the @entity79 is that " the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard , " but same - sex marriage advocates within the @entity79 want it removed , making the language neutral			1
@entity92 for the @entity91 , a nonpartisan advocacy group , say the stance will soon no longer represent an evolving @entity79 , citing a @entity96 public opinion poll that shows 40 % of @entity79 -- and 56 % of @entity79 under age 45 -- support same - sex marriage			1
the @entity79 and gay politics there was a joyous reaction from gay couples who immediately sought marriage licenses in @entity12 while the conservative organization , @entity104 , denounced the @entity1 's move			2
" the truth is no court , by any action or inaction , can redefine marriage , " said president @entity106			0
" federal courts have been arrogantly ignoring this reality			0
that said , from a legal standpoint , the court taking a pass on these cases means the legal battle for marriage continues in our country			2
" in @entity14 , clerks in two counties issued same - sex marriage licenses just hours after the @entity1 declined to hear the cases on monday , the @entity123 reported			1
@entity128 told the @entity123 she was ecstatic about being able to marry her girlfriend @entity129			0
" i 'm officially mrs. @entity128 , " she told the newspaper			0
" we are basking in this moment and celebrating that our children will not have to take on this fight			0
" the next day , @entity14 attorney general @entity135 ordered clerks in all 64 of the state 's counties to issue same - sex licenses to couples who request them			1
" there are no remaining legal requirements that prevent same - sex couples from legally marrying in @entity14 , " @entity135 said			1
the jurisdictional front advocates of gay marriage have been riding a hot streak , but how long will it last ? @entity149 , a constitutional law professor at the @entity150 , believes it 's likely that the winning streak may end somewhere on the appellate level			2
while district judges function more independently , appeals court judges " tend to be more ideological , " @entity149 notes , and thus it 's more likely they cumulatively will express opinions on both sides of the debate			0
that said , whatever these appeals courts decide might be moot			0
experts say this fast - moving wave of decisions will ultimately climax where it began , on the nation 's top court -- with so - called " swing " justice @entity168 most likely siding with the winner on the deeply divided court			2
if you ask @entity176 , law professor @entity174 , there 's only one way to put the issue to rest			0
" this will only authoritatively be decided by the @entity21 @entity1 , " he said			0
by the numbers : same - sex marriage in states where marriage licenses are already being issued , there are legal complications to work out			1
for instance , in @entity10 , state lawmaker @entity186 , a @entity79 , has started a bill to work on language in state codes governing marriage			0
the chapter that addresses marriage is titled " @entity194 " -- that has to be changed , @entity186 said , according to the @entity195			0
back to the @entity196 @entity41 , too , sees circumstances where the @entity1 might need to weigh in , because the tally of states where gay marriage is legal is actually 24 , not 30			2
the reality is , despite what experts believe , justices have not yet ruled -- or refused to rule -- on the same - sex marriage bans in those six states			1
" the one thing we know for sure is that there will not be a 50 - state ruling ( that ) same - sex marriage is required in every state in the union , " @entity41 said			1
" what is complicated and , frankly , somewhat mysterious , is what happens now in the states where the lower courts have said , ' under our interpretation of the @entity219 , we believe there is a right to same - sex marriage			1
' " ultimately , that could prompt the @entity1 to tackle this thorny issue the next time it comes around			0
will same - sex marriage become a 2014 issue ?			1

new : @entity14 attorney general orders counties to issue same - sex marriage licenses tuesday
new : gay marriage is now legal in 25 states
experts believe five other states will soon follow
the momentum is *favoring* gay advocates , but that could change
