-- notorious serial killer @entity1 confessed to more than 30 murders before he was sent to @entity4 's electric chair in 1989 , but experts have always believed there were more			1
now , investigators across the country are hoping a vial of @entity1 's blood -- kept as part of a case record -- will prove or disprove his involvement in cold cases dating as far back as 1961			1
@entity1 's blood , recovered from an evidence lab in @entity17 , @entity4 , will be entered into the @entity19 's @entity18 ( @entity18 ) on friday			1
investigators say it 's a major milestone in a decades - long search for evidence to complete the killer 's profile			1
a reopened 1961 cold case involving a missing 8 - year - old girl in @entity27 , @entity28 , was the impetus for the completed dna profile			1
the girl lived along a newspaper route that the then - teenager @entity1 worked , according to published accounts			0
@entity28 homicide detective @entity33 said her department , which has long suspected a connection between @entity1 and @entity36 , contacted the @entity37 in search of a profile that could provide the needed link			2
" a profile will assist with whatever evidence you have , " said @entity41 , spokesman for the department			0
" it does n't mean someone did it , but it does mean they were there			0
" @entity41 's department contacted law enforcement agencies across the state seeking any evidence that could be used to build a profile on @entity1			2
a vial of @entity1 's blood was recovered from the @entity59 , and though blood samples degrade over time , @entity41 said the department was able to build a profile from that sample			2
@entity1 was put to death in january 1989 , convicted in two trials of three @entity4 murders			1
he had prolonged his life by confessing to other murders in other states and was suspected in many more killings			0
however , he adamantly denied having anything to do with the death of @entity36			0
criminal profiler @entity73 of @entity75 , who has written extensively about @entity1 , said though @entity1 appeared on numerous suspect lists , his killing spree was able to last for years because detectives thought he did n't fit the profile of a typical serial killer			1
at the height of his killing spree in the 1970s , @entity1 would feign a broken arm or leg and ask young women for help -- luring the victims he would later murder			0
at the time of @entity1 's convictions , dna typing was not widely used , but advances in the forensics field have revitalized efforts to link serial killers to unsolved crimes			1
" the technology in the past 25 years went from archaic to phenomenal , " @entity41 said			0
though @entity1 is long gone , @entity41 said , his @entity89 profile could answer lingering questions for police and bring comfort to loved ones			2
