-- as @entity2 celebrates 50 years of independence , many will be looking back on the events of the last half century , which saw country shake off @entity7 colonialism to carve its own identity			1
but it is also a time to look ahead to the next 50 years , and how technology can shape a new @entity2			1
@entity2 's 50th independence celebrations come at a moment of great economic promise for the continent			1
much of the growth has been driven by export of raw materials , investment in infrastructure and expansion of trade in consumer goods			0
the challenge for the future , however , is building a technological foundation for economic transformation			2
probably @entity2 's most important technological achievement was pioneering the world - first mobile money transfer system			1
the transformative innovation is part of a larger revolution in mobile banking			2

the market is projected to $ 5.25 billion in 2020 and will be driven by the rapid adoption of smartphones			0
in its vision to become a middle - income country by 2030 , @entity2 has singled out scientific and technological advancement as a key driver for growth			1
achieving this goal will require the country to do in other sectors what it has done for mobile money transfer and allied financial activities			0
the first step for @entity2 is to consolidate the gains already made in mobile technology			2
there are already plans underway to promote innovation in mobile technology			0
but these efforts need high - level political commitment to define the country as a world leader in the extension of mobile technology to other sectors			0
the key to doing this is building new research universities whose curriculum and teaching are directly influenced by the evolution of the mobile industry			1
@entity2 has recently created the @entity75 , which was incubated by the ministry of telecommunications			2
but this university needs to be more directly integrated into the telecommunications sector with a clear focus on advancing all aspects of the mobile revolution			0

in the early 1960s @entity86 's main exports included wigs and false teeth			0
its success as an industrial nation is largely a result of investing in new research institutions and universities			2
@entity2 needs to embark on a more ambitious technological initiative that can help to galvanize public attention and support the foundation for long - term economic development			2
one obvious next step for the country is geographic information science and technology			0
the @entity2 @entity105 has already passed a motion calling for the creation of a space sector for the country			1
drafts of a policy , strategy and bill for creating the sector already exist			0
the benefits of such an initiative would be profound			0
it could generate vital data for planning and decision - making in a wide range of areas such as environmental management , business planning and security			0
it could also help stimulate the creation of new firms marketing technologies and services			0

such a program could help strengthen @entity2 's role as a regional technology hub			1
such a space program could also help @entity2 monitor climate change and support decisions on critical regional resources such as @entity145			1
developing a space sector is not just a vanity effort but a critical investment for national development			1
advances in technology are dramatically lowering the cost of running such a program			0
in fact , several @entity155 countries have space plans or programs , of which @entity159 is the most advanced			0
read more : how @entity155 innovation can take on the world a technological vision of @entity2 's future demands at least two critical activities			1
first , the country will need to significantly expand its engineering education			1
one way to do this is to upgrade engineering - based training institutes in line ministries into graduate training institutes or research universities			1
second , the presidency will need to be supported on a regular basis by the best available science and technology advice			0
such advice will need to be managed by an office of science and technology advice , directly answerable to the head of state			0
@entity2 is at a critical juncture where it has no alternative but to find new pathways for technological leapfrogging			2
the alternative is falling behind as other players in the region start to invest in moving to new technological frontiers			0
at 50 , the country is overdue to reinvent itself using technological innovation as the engine of economic transformation			2
