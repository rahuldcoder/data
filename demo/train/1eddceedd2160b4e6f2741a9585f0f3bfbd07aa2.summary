-- @entity2 researchers released an audio recording wednesday of an underwater sound that they say could possibly be related to the final moments of missing @entity6			1
it 's a long shot , but researchers at @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 , have been studying records from underwater listening devices , including those meant to monitor for signs of underwater nuclear explosions , in an effort to help find the missing plane			1
" one signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash , " said @entity19 with the university 's @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
researchers have been analyzing the very low frequency sound for weeks to see if it was " the impact of the aircraft on the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank , " @entity19 said			1
" but ( the source of the noise ) is just as likely to be a natural event			1
" low frequency signals can travel thousands of miles through water under favorable circumstances , at about 1 mile per second , @entity19 said			0
but " at the moment ( the sound ) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position , " he said			2
that 's because researchers at @entity9 believe the sound came from an area thousands of miles to the northwest of the current search area in the southern @entity49			1
and even then , they have n't been able to pinpoint the source			0
@entity19 says his team has calculated an " uncertainty box " for the signal 's origin			0
it 's area that stretches some 2,485 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the @entity49 , and spans some 124 to 186 miles in width at its widest point			2
the center of the long , narrow box is south of the tip of @entity62 , as shown in a map released wednesday			0
the university on wednesday released an audio clip captured by one of the listening devices , off of @entity10			1
@entity19 says his team has sped up the recording 10 times to make it audible to the human ear			0
it also shared charts of acoustic signal plots showing what various devices detected			2
searching in the right place ? the search for the missing @entity80 flight continues to focus along an arc hundreds of kilometers long , the area where investigators believe the @entity84 ran out of fuel , about 1,000 miles off the coast of @entity11			1
@entity87 , the chief commissioner with the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) , the organization leading the search into @entity6 at the request of @entity91 , says an international team of experts continues to review the analysis of @entity96 satellite data and aircraft performance			1
in a television exclusive , @entity87 told @entity0 's " @entity103 " he remains confident the final resting place of @entity6 is somewhere along that arc , the so - called " partial handshake " with the satellite : " we 've seen all the data			1
we 've seen all the calculations			0
we are reviewing the calculations and are also developing our own model to cross check and verify that information , " @entity87 told @entity107			2
when asked last week about the underwater sound being analyzed by the team at @entity9 , along with @entity114 , a government agency , @entity87 was skeptical			1
" we think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came , but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with @entity6 , " he said			1
the @entity88 first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on may 26			0
listening below the surface as was the case with the @entity96 satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by @entity6 investigators as a navigational aide -- the analysis of the underwater signals involves the use of technology for a different purpose than its original intent			1
one of the devices , operated by @entity9 and located some 12 miles off @entity10 , is designed to listen to whales and other marine life			2
the other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions , one of 11 operated worldwide by the @entity147 - chartered @entity146 ( @entity146 ) as part of the @entity149			2
early in the search for @entity6 , the @entity147 reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe			1
but the recent efforts involve pairing @entity146 data with other sources to see what can be gleaned , officials said			0
" one can always be hopeful , " said @entity163 , a seismic acoustic analyst with the @entity146			0
the @entity146 's hydro - acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0 - 100 hz range , and ca n't detect black box " pings " in the 30 - 40 khz range , officials said			0
" it 's possible ( to detect a plane crash ) , but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular , " said @entity171			0
prior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed			0
another possible scenario : the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device			2
the @entity146 's system near @entity184 , the southwestern-most point of @entity11 , regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from @entity188 and seismic activity from @entity190 , he said			0
" there are other scenarios that would allow ( the hydrophones to detect a crash )			0
but it 's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it , " @entity171 said			0
attempts were made following the 2009 crash of @entity201 447 in the southern @entity202 to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane 's impact			1
no data could be found			0
years later , after the plane was located , @entity146 again checked its data , and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash .			2

an @entity2 university releases an audio clip and other information
researchers have studied records from underwater listening devices
a sound that was *picked* up is not near the current search area for @entity6
the *academics* say it could be related to the missing plane , or just a natural event
