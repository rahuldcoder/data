-- the @entity1 on wednesday designated @entity3 - based @entity2 and its offshoot @entity4 as " terrorist organizations , " legally enabling @entity7 to take various steps against the groups , their members and their supporters			1
the two groups join a list of " foreign terrorist organizations " that includes @entity15 , @entity16 , the @entity17 and many others			1
being so named means the @entity19 can freeze such organizations ' assets , impose travel bans on their known members and affiliates , and prohibit @entity19 from offering material support			1
@entity19 officials told @entity0 tuesday this move was coming against both organizations , who have been in the news in recent years for various attacks			1
the @entity19 says @entity2 has killed thousands since 2009			1
human rights groups put the figure at more than 3,000			0
@entity2 , which means " @entity35 education is sacrilege " in the @entity36 , has launched a self - described " war on @entity42 " and seeks to impose a strict version of @entity39 law across northeastern @entity3 , if not the entire country			1
it has attacked various targets in the @entity45 nation since its formation in the late 1990s , according to the @entity19 @entity47			2
this includes killing and kidnapping @entity50 , and bombing schools , churches and mosques , the center said			0
in august , militants allegedly went into a mosque in @entity56 and killed 44 worshipers			0
the group released a video boasting it was growing stronger and had launched attacks in @entity61 in september that the @entity1 said left 160 civilians dead , many of them @entity63 women and children			0
in recent months , it has stepped up attacks against students at english - language schools			0
in september , the @entity1 said @entity2 attacked an agricultural school , killing 50 students in their dorm as they slept			2
earlier this month , the @entity73 warned that the extremist group could be found guilty of crimes against humanity after it launched a brutal attack on a wedding party that killed more than 30 people			0
the @entity73 refugee agencies estimates more than 8,000 people in @entity3 have fled into neighboring @entity82 to escape the escalating violence and another 5,000 have become internally displaced			0
while the group 's principal focus is @entity3 , the @entity19 cites links to the @entity15 affiliate in @entity45 , and extremist groups in @entity89			1
gen. @entity90 , then the commander of @entity91 , has warned @entity92 that @entity2 elements " aspire to a broader regional level of attacks , " including against @entity19 and @entity96 interests			1
a @entity2 suicide attack on the @entity73 building two years ago in the @entity3 capital of @entity101 killed at least 25 people			2
in june 2012 , the @entity1 added several of the group 's members to a terrorist blacklist , including its new leader @entity106 , who has a $ 7 million bounty on his head			0
as to @entity4 , it has gone after @entity3 military and @entity35 targets , according to the @entity1			2
this includes a november 2012 raid on a police station in @entity101 that killed @entity3 police officers and sprung free several terrorists			0
the @entity1 also blames @entity4 for kidnapping foreigners who live and work in the @entity45 nation plus attacking a convoy of @entity3 peacekeepers			2
the decision to designate @entity2 and @entity4 as terrorist organizations followed a robust debate			1
the administration faced intense pressure from @entity92 and some officials to list the groups , given their history of violence			0
other officials and experts warned they did not pose a threat to the @entity19 , adding that designating them as terrorist organizations could make @entity7 more of a target			1
and some officials argued the @entity3 government could interpret the decision as an @entity19 green light to continue its heavy - handed crackdown on the organization			2
@entity3 president @entity141 stepped up a military campaign against the group six months ago , declaring a six - month state of emergency in may in the three northeastern states worst hit by the violence			0
recent @entity148 and @entity149 reports accused the @entity3 military of human rights abuses and violations when conducting operations against the group			2
the @entity73 said it is investigating the claims			0
the @entity1 hinted at this issue in its announcement designating @entity2 and @entity4 as terrorist groups			1
" all of our assistance to @entity3 stresses the importance of protecting civilians and ensuring that human rights are respected , " the @entity1 said			0
" that assistance and these designations demonstrate @entity19 support for the @entity3 people 's fight against @entity2 and @entity4			1

@entity2 , @entity4 designated as terrorist organizations by the @entity19
that means the @entity19 can freeze assets , *restrict* travel , go after *backers*
@entity2 is blamed for attacks in @entity3 , may have bigger aspirations
@entity4 is an offshoot of @entity2 that 's accused of kidnappings , more
