@entity0 -- lamenting he is ringing in the new year with an old concern , chief justice @entity2 is again warning leaders in the other two branches of government that continuing budget shortfalls and sequestration cuts will create a " bleak " future for the fair administration of justice in the nation 's federal courts			1
in his annual year - end report on the judiciary , @entity2 on tuesday said the courts have already made significant unilateral cuts in funding , adding a prolonged reduction by @entity20 would be extremely hard to overcome			1
" i would like to choose a fresher topic , but duty calls , " said the 58 - year - old chief justice			1
" the budget remains the single most important issue facing the courts			0
" " what would be the consequence of forgoing this [ modest proposed increase in ] funding in favor of a hard freeze at the sequester level ? the future would be bleak : the deep cuts to judiciary programs would remain in place			2
" @entity2 made his remarks in a 15 - page summary of @entity40 courts , part of his role as head of the entire federal judiciary			1
the effects of the so - called sequester in the past year have been particularly hard on the third branch of government -- from civil and bankruptcy cases being delayed ; furloughs of hundreds of court staff and federal public defenders ; and reductions in courthouse security and monitoring of criminals on probation			0
nationwide , the judiciary 's budget had been cut nearly $ 350 million for the fiscal year that went through september , just from the sequester			1
" emergency measures " have been imposed by the @entity61 , the federal court 's internal policy arm			2
" in the civil and bankruptcy venues , further consequences would include commercial uncertainty , lost opportunities and unvindicated rights , " said @entity2			2
" in the criminal venues , those consequences pose a genuine threat to public safety			0
" after cost reductions , what next ? weeks of furloughs from sequestration and the partial government shutdown meant up to a 24 % reduction in staffing in some judicial branch offices through the fall , when @entity20 enacted another continuing resolution in october to restore some of the lapses in federal funding			2
congressional leaders said they hoped to finish the appropriations process for fiscal year 2014 by january 15			0
@entity2 noted the judicial branch generally receives less attention when it comes to its spending , but said an " aggressive " cost - containment strategy has been in place since 2004			0
that includes new plans to close or downsize 31 federal court facilities across the country , to reduce work space and rent costs			0
but the chief justice said such discretionary internal cutbacks can only go so far , since most of the courts ' " core functions " are constitutionally and statutorily required , including hearing all criminal , civil , and bankruptcy cases presented to them			1
" in the coming weeks , and into the future , i encourage the president and @entity20 to be attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and avert the adverse consequences that would result from funding the judiciary below its minimal needs , " he said			2
while the chief justice continued his respectful tone in the face of fiscal constraints , a number of federal judges have told @entity1 privately in recent months of their anger and frustration -- juggling rising caseloads and responsibilities with diminishing resources			1
part of that unease has to do with their lack of political clout			0
the federal courts only make up two - tenths of 1 % of the entire federal budget , and judges by custom stay out of partisan policy fights			1
but many do not like how the other two branches are handling the fiscal crisis in their sphere			0
looking for a ' happy ending ' the federal court system and its administrative offices operate on an annual budget of about $ 7 billion			1
that includes judges trying and hearing cases and appeals , both criminal and civil ; managing pretrial , defender , and probation offices ; and maintaining the bankruptcy court system			0
most of the money -- about 62 % -- goes for personnel costs			0
@entity2 noted the courts earlier this month submitted a budget proposal to @entity20 that was $ 180 million less than their original plan , which he said " strikes a fair balance " with other competing funding requests			1
" it takes no imagination to see that failing to meet the judiciary 's essential requirements undermines the public 's confidence in all three branches of government , " he concluded			1
" both ' @entity169 ' and ' @entity170 ' have happy endings			0
we are encouraged that the story of funding for the federal judiciary -- though perhaps not as gripping a tale -- will too			2
" there are 874 full - time , life - tenured federal judges , including the nine - member @entity179 , the district and appeals courts , and the nine - member @entity183 -- part of a 35,000 federal court workforce nationwide			0
past year - end reports from the current chief justice of the @entity40 ( the official title ) have focused on frozen salaries , rising caseloads and court security			2
these summaries have been an annual tradition for about four decades			0
they were begun by the late chief justice @entity196 as a way to speak to the executive branch and @entity20 , the judiciary itself , and the public at large .			1

chief justice @entity2 issues his annual report
he 's not happy with federal budget for judiciary
