-- @entity3 drastically changed course then soared to near its peak altitude , a senior @entity2 aviation source said -- adding yet another wrinkle to the enigma of the plane 's last flight			1
before disappearing from radar screens on march 8 , the commercial airliner deviated from its planned route from @entity15 to @entity16 by turning leftward over water while it was still inside @entity20 airspace , the @entity2 aviation source told @entity0 's @entity21			1
the aircraft then climbed to 39,000 feet , just short of the @entity25 's 41,000 - foot safe operating limit , and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the @entity27 before beginning to descend , the source said			1
why ? that and so much else -- including where the plane is now -- remains a mystery			0
investigators have been trying for weeks to piece together bits of information trying to get the answers being demanded by relatives of the 239 people aboard the plane , not to mention millions more around the world who have been captivated by this ordeal			1
in addition to this newly revealed development , investigators have determined that the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters , or @entity48 , which are designed to transmit a plane 's location to an emergency satellite when triggered by a crash or by contact with water , the source added			1
the @entity48 were at the plane 's front door , its rear door , in the fuselage and in the cockpit , said the source , who was puzzled over why they appear either not to have activated or , if they did activate , why they were not picked up by the satellite			1
relatives of the 239 passengers and crew have raised questions about the @entity48 with @entity2 authorities , suggesting there were at least three aboard the plane , including two portable units and one fixed device			0
no comment from @entity76 @entity76 has declined to answer @entity0 's questions about the @entity48 and other matters pertaining to the flight , which vanished six weeks ago after taking off shortly after midnight from @entity15 , @entity2			1
the airline said it could not comment on " any questions that relate to information held by other authorities and / or fall under the jurisdiction of the ongoing investigation			0
... " besides this probe , the plight has spurred an expansive , expensive search to find the aircraft			1
that includes the dispatching of up to 11 military aircraft and 12 ships saturday across three areas off @entity95 , @entity96			1
they will cover about 20,000 square miles ( 50,000 square kilometers ) and brave isolated showers , according to @entity96 's @entity99			1
there may not be much more of this , however			0
officials have said searches from air and ships are probably nearing an end			2
that does n't surprise former @entity110 @entity109 managing director @entity108 , given the results so far			0
" there 's a lot of resources being expended there ; it 's turned up nothing , " he said			2
but @entity108 predicts the underwater phase of the search will continue for the six to eight weeks needed to cover the current search zone			1
if that turns up nothing , he predicted , towed array sonar probably would be used to search a wider zone			2
" this is a very complex operation , " ocean search specialist @entity124 said			2
" it 's going to be a game of patience now			2
" as of early saturday , the underwater drone scouring the bottom of the @entity132 had taken six trips looking for the missing jetliner with a seventh mission then underway			1
the @entity99 said the @entity137 - 21 search has covered about 50 square miles			2
while the information gleamed from the sixth trip was still being analyzed , the first five did n't yield any breakthroughs			2
@entity2 's acting transport minister , @entity141 tweeted friday that authorities are looking at deploying more unmanned underwater probes			1
officials might consider searching along a large portion of sea highlighted by a partial digital " handshake " between the jetliner and an @entity150 satellite , said @entity151 , @entity96 's top transport official			0
that arc of sea is more than 370 miles long and 30 miles wide			0
a prolonged undersea search by private contractors could cost a " ballpark rough estimate " of $ 234 million , said @entity151			0
passengers ' kin list questions the continuing search efforts came as relatives of the people who were aboard the jetliner pressed for answers			0
they have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by @entity2 officials , who are to meet with them next week in @entity16			0
most of the @entity3 passengers and crew were @entity170			0
among their questions : what 's in the flight 's log book ? can they review the jet 's maintenance records ? can they listen to recordings of the @entity25 pilot 's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost ? @entity141 has defended his government 's handling of the operation and accused members of the news media of focusing on the @entity170 families			1
he said relatives of passengers and crew from other nations represented have not had problems			0
" the most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

new : 6th underwater drone mission finishes ; 7th such trip is underway
