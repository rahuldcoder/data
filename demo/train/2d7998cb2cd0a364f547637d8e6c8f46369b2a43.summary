@entity0 -- the question of same - sex marriage went before the @entity5 @entity4 on tuesday in the first of two oral arguments this week on separate appeals			1
the opening public session was devoted to a @entity11 ban approved by voters			1
in a swirl of analysis after the event , the question was whether the justices would issue a sweeping decision this year on whether states can say who can or ca n't get married			1
or would they leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , choosing to let state legislatures and courts sort it all out ? here are five things we learned from arguments in this case			1
buyer 's remorse many of the nine justices wondered why they were deciding whether states can or should ban same sex marriage			1
opponents of @entity39 , the voter - approved measure prohibiting the practice , want the court to say that gay and lesbian couples have an " equal protection " right to wed. that is the constitutional issue the court agreed to decide when it accepted an appeal from the referendum 's supporters			1
but a cautious court seemed to pull back in the 80 - minute public session			1
justices appear hesitant as they hear arguments " the problem with the case is that you 're really asking , particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite , for us to go into uncharted waters , " said justice @entity55 , viewed by many as the one to watch on the closely divided court			1
" i just wonder if the case was properly granted " for review			2
the court could easily say private citizens who put the measure before the voters in 2008 do not have " standing " or jurisdiction to now appeal the case			2
that would hand gay rights supporters a narrow victory , confined only to @entity11			1
it would foreclose a broader ruling that might apply to all 50 states , or even those nine states like @entity11 that have civil union laws , that stop just short of marriage for homosexual couples			1
@entity55 's control if there was any doubt , tuesday arguments showed this is @entity55 's court			1
the 76 - year - old jurist is likely to be the controlling or " swing " vote for however the court decides the tricky issues			1
four more liberal justices appeared at least open to the idea that same - sex marriage should be allowed in @entity11			1
three more conservative justices seemed to take a more " traditional " view : that marriage is between one man and one woman			1
justice @entity100 , who does not speak at oral arguments , seems likely to agree			1
that leaves the moderate - conservative @entity55 possibly in the middle and perhaps ready to offer a more nuanced , compromise view			1
the arguments from competing lawyers appeared to be especially targeted at @entity55 's concerns			1
those who have worked with him have said he often agonizes openly in tough , hot - button cases			2
deciding these issues for him is not an easy intellectual exercise			2
that uncertainly was expressed in one remark on tuesday during arguments when he summarized the competing legal positions and perhaps his own internal dilemma			2
key questions answered " i think there 's substance to the point that sociological information is new " on the effect of same - sex marriage , he said			1
" we have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more			0
on the other hand , there is an immediate legal injury ... and that 's the voice of these children			0
there are some 40,000 children in @entity11 , according to ( a brief in the case in opposition to @entity39 ) , that live with same - sex parents			1
and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status			0
the voice of those children is important in this case , do n't you think ? " 3			2
@entity147 being @entity147 a good @entity4 argument would not be complete if there was not some rousing rhetoric from the senior associate justice			1
@entity147 did not disappoint , and he clearly was not buying the argument same - sex marriage was a constitutional right			1
consider this exchange where @entity147 , the father of nine and grandfather of three dozen more , questioned his old friend @entity157 , the attorney opposing proposition 8			0
" i 'm curious , when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage ? " he asked			2
" 1791 ? 1868 , when the @entity162 was adopted ? " @entity165 : " when did it become unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages ? " which the court overturned in 1967			0
@entity147 : " do n't give me a question to my question			0
" that brought laughter to the courtroom			0
liberal blogs had a field day with his remarks , openly questioning whether @entity147 could give fair - minded consideration of the views expressed by gay rights supporters			2
five things to watch 4			0
subdued liberals the two newest justices , @entity183 appointees @entity184 and @entity185 , have shown to be no - nonsense , aggressive questioners			1
they questioned both sides in the argument , but neither matched the rhetorical firepower of @entity147 or chief justice @entity192			2
@entity185 and @entity147 got into a debate over an argument made by " traditional " marriage supporters -- that it promotes " socially responsible " procreation among a married man and woman			2
@entity147 suggested there was considerable disagreement over the effects on children of single - sex adoption			1
@entity185 : " suppose a state said ' because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation , we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55			2
' would that be constitutional ? " @entity213 , attorney supporting @entity39 : " no , your honor , it would not be constitutional			2
" @entity185 : " because that 's the same state interest , i would think , you know			0
if you are over the age of 55 , you do n't help us serve the government 's interest in regulating procreation through marriage			0
so why is that different " than denying homosexuals from marrying ? @entity185 : " i can just assure you , if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55 , there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage			0
" @entity147 , matching humor with humor : " i suppose we could have a questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in to get the marriage -- you know , are you fertile , or are you not fertile ? " laughter in the courtroom			0
" i suspect this court would hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy , do n't you think ? " find out which states match your values with @entity1 's lgbt rights calculator @entity185 's questioning was sharp and focused and put the lawyer on the spot			0
but it was delivered in a methodical , even low - key fashion			0
she wanted an answer but was not especially eager to score points with the audience or the public at large			0
contrast that with @entity147 , who seems to gleefully play to the crowd			0
he topped @entity185 's funny remark with another of his own , determined it seemed to get the last laugh			0
among the justices themselves , being either an aggressive questioner or a thoughtful , more subdued questioner does not earn you points either way when it comes to voting on the merits			0
each has a personal style			0
but public perception does count , and many progressive legal activists have lamented the fact that none of the four more liberal justices , who include @entity274 and @entity275 , have the personality or inclination to be a swashbuckler in public court sessions -- giving a full - throated voice to their views			2
courtroom flavor the @entity4 has a distinct aura when big cases are argued			2
the audience of several hundred spectators is juiced , the justices seem more energetic and engaged in their questioning			0
that was true on tuesday			0
celebrities like actor / director @entity292 ( an original legal opponent of @entity39 ) added to the flavor			0
the competing rallies outside the court , and the several hundred people waiting in line in the cold for a precious court seat , completed the drama			0
more arguments are scheduled for wednesday on a challenge to a federal law known as the @entity304			0
that 1996 legislation denies a range of financial and other benefits to legally married same - sex couples			1
after that , the court will quiet down once more			0
the justices will sit down this week in private session -- just the nine of them -- and secretly vote at least preliminarily on these cases			1
opinion - writing will be assigned , and then the task of crafting a ruling acceptable to a majority will commence			0
the outcome will probably not be known until late june			0
by the numbers : same - sex marriage			1

@entity4 heard first of two arguments this week on same - sex marriage
@entity4 could rule broadly on constitutional issues or let states and lower courts sort it out
justices seemed cautious about the issue and the specific case before them : the @entity11 ban
justice @entity55 could emerge as the swing vote in any narrow decision
