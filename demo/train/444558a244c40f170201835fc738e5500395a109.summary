-- some reviewers have called " @entity2 , " @entity5 's @entity4 film about d - day and the search for a soldier , one of the greatest war movies			1
military historian @entity10 begs to differ			2
not only is it not the greatest war movie , it 's not even the best cinematic depiction of d - day , says @entity10 , author of the newly published " d - day : the @entity16 " ( @entity17 )			1
he admires the famed @entity20 opening -- " probably the most realistic battle sequence ever filmed , " he said -- but described the rest of " @entity2 " as " ghastly			1
" " it 's sort of a ' @entity25 ' cliche of the worst form , " he said			0
he has expanded on the criticism in a lecture			0
" @entity5 's basic story line had great potential			0
it shows the tension between patriotic and therefore collective loyalty , and the struggle of the individual for survival : those mutually contradictory pressures , which in many ways lie at the heart of war , " @entity10 observed in the talk			2
if any filmmakers wish to take on d - day again , @entity10 's book provides enough material for a dozen screenplays			1
making use of first - person accounts stored in the @entity49 , as well as a wealth of other material , @entity10 depicts in painstaking detail not only the d - day landings by @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity58 and free @entity57 forces , but also the subsequent battle for the whole of @entity61 that proved pivotal in defeating @entity62			1
@entity10 says a director would do well to remember that the @entity65 effort to retake the continent extended well beyond that single day of june 6 , 1944			1
" d - day , although an iconic moment , was not actually the end of it			1
films like ' @entity72 ' and ' @entity2 ' almost give the impression that d - day was ' it ' and then the next thing people know about was the liberation of @entity78 , " he said			1
" but in fact it was the fighting in @entity61 which was far worse			0
casualties on d - day were far lighter than expected -- [ military leaders ] had expected 10,000 dead and only 3,000 died			1
" the real fighting and the real casualties , " he added , " came in the @entity84			0
" so what does @entity88 prefer in the way of a @entity92 treatment of d - day ? another project @entity5 had a hand in , " @entity96			1
" " on the whole i think [ it ] was pretty close to the truth , " @entity10 said of the 2001 @entity98 miniseries , which @entity5 and @entity100 executive produced			2
he called it " incomparably more realistic " than " @entity2			2
" " the improvement was presumably due to the fact that it was a pretty faithful adaptation of the book by @entity108 , " he said			0
a major problem with " @entity110 , " @entity10 said , is the climax of the film			2
" the @entity113 arrives in the nick of time just like the @entity54 cavalry in 1950s cowboy films			0
and to cap it all , the final frames are of @entity110 , standing in old age amid the rows of white crosses in a military cemetery , saluting his fallen comrades as tears run down his cheeks			0
" that 's @entity5 " milking our tear ducts with both hands , " @entity10 said			2
but then again , the historian believes @entity92 is not well cast in the role of purveyor of history			2
" the central problem is that historical truth and the needs of the movie and television industry remain fundamentally incompatible			0
@entity92 has to simplify @entity4 according to set formulae , " @entity10 said in his lecture			1
" its films have to have heroes and of course baddies			0
there are seldom shades of gray			0
" among @entity4 films , @entity10 praises two from 2006 directed by @entity148 ( and produced by @entity5 ) , " @entity149 " and " letters from @entity151 "			0
" but they are the exception which proves the rule that you do not need to resort to the tricks , the false claims of truth and even the clich√©s of the platoon movie , " he said			0
and the best war movie ? @entity10 looks away from @entity92 for his answer : 1965 's " the 317th platoon , " a @entity57 film set during that country 's war in @entity167 .			1

@entity10 , author of new book on d - day , not a *fan* of " @entity2 "
@entity10 admires the opening , but calls the rest " ghastly "
@entity10 's pick for best @entity92 d - day work : " @entity96 "
