the term " nightmare bacteria " does not bode well for anyone who may get infected			1
that 's what @entity6 epidemiologists call carbapenem - resistant @entity8 , or @entity9 , which kill up to half the patients who contract them			1
the family of superbugs made headlines two years ago when the @entity6 warned it was spreading			2
now , they 're back in the news after seven patients at a @entity19 hospital caught @entity9 after routine endoscopic treatments for bile ducts , gall bladder or pancreas			1
two of them have died , the @entity24 said wednesday			0
@entity9 was a contributing factor in the deaths , but the exact cause of the deaths was n't immediately disclosed , a hospital spokeswoman said			1
the medical center is contacting 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between october and january			1
it 's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria			1
here are some important things to know about the deadly disease			0
it is a family of bacteria usually found in hospitals and other health care facilities that has evolved a huge resistance to antibiotics			1
@entity9 can be so deadly , because few antibiotics work against its different variations			1
that 's what the name " carbapenem - resistant " means -- carbapenem is a class of antibiotics often used as a last resort against a bad bacterial infection			1
but they are no match for @entity9 , the @entity6 said			1
not really ; they are bacteria that just evolved			2
the superbug family includes @entity62 and @entity61 , which people have naturally in their intestines			2
but when they spread to other parts of the body , they can wreak havoc			0
some @entity9 make an enzyme called @entity71 that destroys those strong antibiotics			1
the enzyme seems to be a pretty new adaptation ; researchers first discovered it in 2001			0
you do n't get it when somebody sneezes on you			0
you have to touch an infected wound or stool , then touch a vulnerable part of the body -- like an open wound			2
that 's why it does n't spread on the street but instead in hospitals , where health care workers and others can spread it by touch			0
someone may forget to wash their hands after coming in contact with stool or a wound			0
or a procedure could be performed with a contaminated instrument , like an endoscope or a surgical device			0
but @entity9 can also spread from other soiled invasive medical inserts like respirator tubes or catheters			1
those infected are usually patients being treated for some other ailment			2
these patients have underlying health conditions , which may have left them more susceptible to @entity9 and other infections			1
but some researchers warn that @entity9 could spill over into the streets , too , if they become more widespread in hospitals			1
no , said the @entity114			0
the procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or @entity117			0
it is used among other things to unblock bile ducts and take care of pancreas issues			0
" it is estimated that more than 500,000 @entity124 are performed each year in the @entity125 , " @entity114 said			0
" from what we know , over the past few years , there have been fewer than 100 known cases of transmission of these problematic bacteria through @entity117			2
" the @entity117 procedure involves a duodenoscope , a flexible , lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth , throat , stomach , and into the top of the small intestine ( the duodenum )			0
its design may impede effective cleaning , the @entity141 said thursday in a safety communication			1
the device contains a hollow channel that allows the injection of contrast dye or the insertion of other instruments to obtain tissue samples for biopsy or treat certain abnormalities			0
the device also has a movable " elevator " mechanism at the tip , the agency said			0
even meticulously cleaning the devices prior to high - level disinfection " may not entirely eliminate " the risk of transmitting infection , the @entity141 said			1
" reprocessing is a detailed , multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices			0
recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug - resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone @entity117 with reprocessed duodenoscopes , even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly , " the @entity141 said			1
" although the complex design of duodenoscopes improves the efficiency and effectiveness of @entity117 , it causes challenges for cleaning and high - level disinfection			1
some parts of the scopes may be extremely difficult to access and effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible , " the @entity141 said			1
none of the companies the @entity141 identified as duodenoscope manufacturers -- @entity188 , @entity189 or @entity190 -- could be immediately reached for comment			1
yes , but not many			0
and some that do can cause kidney damage			0
but they 're only part of the treatment			0
caregivers also remove some bacteria by draining off the abscess			2
some @entity9 strains have been reported that are resistant to all antibiotics			1
on the other hand , some people contract the bacteria without an infection ever breaking out			1
cleanliness in all things is important			0
wash hands , sterilize instruments			0
if you 're a patient in a hospital , remind staff to do the same , and do n't share a room with an infected patient , the @entity6 said			2
also , if you come down with a harsh bacterial infection after medical treatment in another country , be sure to tell your health care provider about that treatment			2
some cre are more common overseas than in the @entity125			0
also , some researchers believe doctors should be careful not to prescribe antibiotics too quickly			2
the ubiquitousness of antibiotics led superbugs to develop resistance to them in the first place , according to many experts			2
@entity0 's @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0

design of medical scopes ' causes challenges for cleaning and high - level disinfection , ' @entity141 says
@entity9 is not one but a group of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics
people who get infected are almost always *recipients* of invasive medical treatments
