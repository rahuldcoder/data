the @entity1 festival has been celebrated throughout @entity2 for centuries , usually to mark the end of the rainy season			1
each year , thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky to symbolically ward off bad luck , while rivers are covered by floating flower lanterns , adorned with candles and joss sticks , cast into waterways to wish for good luck			1
with flower and flame , the city of @entity16 in particular comes alive during these festive days each november			2
the event has been transformed over the years from a reverent temple ritual to a rowdy street party that lasts for days			1
" the real meaning of the festival is to worship @entity26 and the goddess of the river , " says @entity22 a native of @entity16			2
but now it 's a magnet for foreign and local tourists with dozens of events and parades taking place throughout the city each day and night			0
while the carefully crafted floating flower lanterns do n't disrupt the city with anything more than banana leaves and blooms , the flying lanterns have a potentially more hazardous impact			1
during this year 's festival , like years gone by , dozens of flights from the local airport had to be diverted or canceled the moment thousands of lanterns took to the air			0
it seems that despite threats of fines and prosecution , @entity16 residents and visitors alike chose to respect the ancient traditions rather than modern laws			0
legal or not , it did create a dazzling spectacle in the night sky .			0
