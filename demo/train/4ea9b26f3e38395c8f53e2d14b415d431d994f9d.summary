-- @entity1 of @entity2 , @entity3 , does n't remember the first time it happened			1
it 's still a blur			1
but she thinks the episodes began about 50 years ago			2
at least that 's when she remembers someone telling her she was talking gibberish			2
" my friends would look at me and say ' what are you talking about ? ' at 71 , @entity1 knows to expect the unexpected			2
since she was a teen she has suffered from serious migraines			1
" the kind that cause you to go into a dark room , and shut the door ; the pain is that bad , " she says			2
but she knew how to control them , and why they were happening			2
yet , when it came to her speech , that was different			2
" i had no idea that i was babbling , " she admits			2
yet when people began telling her at times she did n't make any sense , she started to wonder ; why were her words and phrases coming out all wrong ? at first , @entity1 thought she might be having mini-strokes , but when she went to numerous neurologists they all told her the same thing : she was suffering from a form of headache classified as a complex migraine			1
do you live with complex migraines ? share your advice " what makes a complex migraine different from the common migraine is that neurologic event outlasts the headache itself , " says dr. @entity44 , a neurologist at @entity46 in @entity47 , and @entity1 's physician			1
according to the @entity53 , 23 million @entity52 suffer from some form of unusual migraines that could be termed complex			1
these headaches are more common in women and can occur at any age			2
although there are different forms of complex migraines , all occur when blood vessels over dilate , when there 's a decrease of blood flowing to the brain , or when the trigeminal nerve , found in the brain and responsible for sensation in the face , becomes irritated			1
" it can affect virtually any part of the brain , " notes @entity44			0
" it 's a complicated chemical reaction we call " spreading depression			1
" part of the brain hyper - polarizes			0
that part of the brain does n't receive as much blood supply , because the brain is n't signaling correctly			0
" symptoms from these migraines can range from coldness in hands and feet , to dull aches , to a loss of sensation or paralysis , even weakness and nausea			1
in @entity1 's case , as well as in the case of reporter @entity94 who began talking gibberish during a live shot after the @entity97 , the ability to speak was affected			0
" migraines that are associated with this type of speech deficit can be understood in the same way that strokes can be understood , " explains @entity44			1
" different types of language problems can occur as different parts of the brain are affected			0
" " in the case of the reporter at the @entity97 , the type of speech problem she had is what we called @entity115 's aphasia , " continues @entity44			0
" her speech was fluent , but the words that were coming out were nonsensical			0
" and complicated migraines can go hand in hand with a number of other serious conditions , including depression , strokes , even heart abnormalities			1
" if you know anything about migraines , as i do , " says @entity1 , " you know there 's a connection to a lot of different problems			1
how can you not think about those ? " although migraines themselves can be treated with medication , the drugs are n't always foolproof			1
even if medications can cut down on the episodes and in some cases , the pain , complex migraines , can pop up at any time , no matter what drugs a patient is on			1
@entity1 says she never knows when an episode will happen			0
most of the time she 's alone , with just her cat , @entity149 , but even her feline friend , " cocks her head to the side as if i 'm just making sounds , " @entity1 chuckles			0
" they do n't seem to happen a lot , " she believes			0
" maybe two or three times a year			0
when i think they are happening , i just lie down and try to let them pass			0
" @entity44 says , in @entity1 's case her nonsensical words are n't confined to just her speech			0
over the years , @entity44 has received e-mails from @entity1 , filled with words that make no sense			0
he says that 's pretty rare			0
although @entity1 says she 's learned how to live with these headaches , there 's always that worry that her complex migraines may be precursors to something more dangerous			1
she lost her partner almost 30 years ago to a stroke			0
he , too , suffered from migraines " it 's scary " says @entity1 with a sigh			1
" but you have to live with it , the same as you live with a lot of things in this world			0
