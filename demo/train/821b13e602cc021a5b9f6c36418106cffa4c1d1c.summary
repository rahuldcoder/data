-- @entity2 offered his second wife a choice of an open marriage or a divorce when he revealed to her he was having an affair with the woman he later made his third wife , @entity1 said in interviews with @entity11 and the @entity12			1
a day after he told his wife about his affair with @entity17 in may 1999 , the former @entity14 speaker delivered a speech titled " @entity19 " to a group of @entity22 women in @entity23 , the @entity12 reported thursday			1
" how could he ask me for a divorce on monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people ? " @entity1 said in her interview with the @entity12			1
the former congressman responded forcefully to the allegations at the start of thursday 's @entity22 presidential debate moderated by @entity0 , calling the story " despicable " and saying he was " appalled that you would begin a presidential debate with a topic like that			1
" " the story is false , " @entity2 said			1
" every personal friend i have who knew us in that period said that story was false			2
we offered several of them to @entity11 to prove it was false , ( but ) they were n't interested because they would like to attack any @entity22			1
" @entity1 's revelations echo what she told a reporter for an article published in @entity51 in august 2010 , but it is the first time @entity1 has talked about it on camera			1
@entity11 began releasing excerpts of the interview thursday morning , with a promise of the full interview on the network 's " @entity60 " program			0
" i said to him , ' @entity2 , we 've been married a long time , ' and he said , ' yes , but you want me all to yourself			2
@entity17 does n't care what i do , ' " @entity1 said in the clip released by @entity11 , describing the couple 's conversation near the end of their 18 - year marriage			1
her husband , who had already left @entity71 , was asking " that i accept the fact that he has somebody else in his life , " @entity1 said			2
" oh , he was asking to have an open marriage and i refused , " she said			1
she said she rejected his suggestion that they remain married while he keeps a mistress			0
" no , no , that is not a marriage , " she said			0
the @entity51 article reported that @entity1 asked his wife " to just tolerate the affair			2
" @entity2 's marital history is not a new controversy for the @entity22 presidential candidate			1
he married @entity1 , who was a 28 - year - old congressional staffer , six months after his divorce from his first wife , @entity90 , was final			2
his presidential campaign has tried to frame the first divorce as something his then - wife wanted , contrary to court documents that indicated she objected to his divorce filing			0
@entity90 has never talked on camera about her marriage			0
she refused a @entity0 request for an interview last month			0
@entity2 was asked about the controversy thursday morning while campaigning in @entity102 , @entity103 , where voters will cast ballots in the @entity22 primary saturday			1
" it is an issue that i confront every time it comes up and i confront it exactly the same way every time it comes up and people seem to be satisfied with it , " @entity1 said			0
when pressed by reporters for a reaction to his second wife 's tv interview , he said that his two daughters had " already written to @entity11 complaining about this as tawdry and inappropriate			2
" " both of my daughters are prepared to speak on the record with any of you who would like to talk to them			0
several other people who knew the situation are prepared to speak on the record			0
i am not getting involved , " the former @entity14 speaker said , hours before the debate			0
the letter to @entity11 from his daughters from his first marriage , @entity132 and @entity133 , was released by the @entity1 campaign wednesday			1
" the failure of a marriage is a terrible and emotional experience for everyone involved , " they wrote			0
" anyone who has had that experience understands it is a personal tragedy filled with regrets , and sometimes differing memories of events			0
we will not say anything negative about our father 's ex-wife			1
he has said before , privately and publicly , that he regrets any pain he may have caused in the past to people he loves			0
" the @entity1 daughters wrote that they were confident @entity103 voters were more interested in what their father has to say " about job creation , lower taxes , and about who can defeat @entity161 by providing the sharpest contrast to his damaging , extreme liberalism			1
" " our father is running for president because of his grandchildren -- so they can inherit the @entity167 he loves , " they wrote			0
" to do that , president @entity161 must be defeated			0
and as the only candidate in the race , including @entity161 , who has actually helped balance the national budget , create jobs , reform welfare , and cut taxes and spending , @entity2 felt compelled to run -- to serve his country and safeguard his grandchildren 's future			2
