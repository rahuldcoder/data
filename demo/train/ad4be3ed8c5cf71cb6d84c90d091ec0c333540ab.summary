-- being top of the tennis tree can make grand slam predictions a little predictable , especially if your name is @entity6			1
the world @entity7 breezed into the third round of @entity10 thursday with a 6 - 1 6 - 1 victory over @entity13 @entity12			1
the demolition lasted just 49 minutes and was more than enough to confirm @entity6 ' status as favorite for a sixth @entity10 crown			1
" i 'm always the favorite , " the @entity18 told reporters at the @entity20			1
" it 's been that way for the last three years and maybe years before that			0
so it can create pressure			0
but it 's ok -- i 'd rather it was that way			0
" being the favorite , and defending champion , did not help @entity6 at last month 's @entity31 , where she crashed out in the second round			1
the 32 - year - old is now taking a softly - softly approach to the @entity36 grass court tournament , as she aims to finally claim her 18th grand slam to tie with legends @entity38 and @entity40			0
she next faces @entity43 25th seed @entity41 , who won their last meeting on hard courts in @entity47 this year but lost their first three encounters			0
" i do n't want to feel great necessarily right now because hopefully i have several more matches i can play , " said @entity6			2
" the goal for me is just to feel a little better every day			0
i feel there 's some things i still want to work on to hopefully stay in the tournament			0
" it was a case of once bitten twice shy for men 's second seed @entity56 on @entity58			1
@entity60 's world @entity7 lost the first set to @entity63 @entity62 , who dumped him out of the tournament in 2012 , and found himself heading for a repeat at 2 - 4 down in the second			1
but the 2008 and 2010 @entity10 champion regained his composure and pulled himself back into the match			1
he roared with delight as he sealed a 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 victory to reach the third round for the first time since 2011 , setting up a clash with @entity77 's 63rd - ranked @entity76			0
" i was just trying to fight , " said nine - time @entity31 winner @entity56			2
" i was waiting for my moment , trying to find my moment			0
" he was serving very well -- that always happens on the grass			0
that second set was very important for me			0
to be two sets down against a player like @entity62 is very dangerous			2
" @entity86 cantered into the third round after his match with @entity89 was interrupted to close the roof on @entity58 as a late evening shower washed @entity92			2
when the players returned under lights , @entity86 did n't waste any time			2
the seven - time @entity10 champion wrapped up a 6 - 3 7 - 5 6 - 3 victory over the @entity99 qualifier			2
the @entity101 star will meet either @entity60 's @entity102 or @entity104 @entity103 next			0
@entity86 was satisfied to advance after last season 's shock second - round defeat to @entity109 's @entity108 , who is also into the third round			1
" it was really a serving contest out there , i 'm happy i made it , " @entity86 , the fourth seed , told the media			1
" the second set was tough today with the rain delay			0
it 's nice to get those wins but better keep working hard and try to be consistent			0
" @entity119 made short work of @entity101 challenger @entity121 on thursday evening , sweeping into the third round with a 6 - 2 6 - 1 victory			1
the @entity124 fifth seed won her first grand slam of the grass of @entity10 in 2004 as a 17 - year - old and returns to @entity92 in ominous form as the @entity31 champion			2
@entity119 faces @entity18 @entity130 , who defeated @entity132 @entity131 , in the third round			1
elsewhere , in the men 's draw , @entity43 seeds @entity133 and @entity135 faced five - set zingers on day four at the @entity20			1
promising @entity140 @entity139 sent 13th seed @entity133 packing 3 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 4 7 - 5 10 - 8 while @entity135 , the no. 14 , defeated @entity18 @entity142 with another epic scoreline 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 7 6 - 3 14 - 12			1
