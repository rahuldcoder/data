-- the morning the @entity3 oil rig exploded , a @entity5 executive and a @entity7 official argued over how to proceed with the drilling , rig survivors told @entity0 's @entity9 in an exclusive interview			1
the survivors ' account paints perhaps the most detailed picture yet of what happened on the deepwater rig -- and the possible causes of the april 20 explosion			1
the @entity5 official wanted workers to replace heavy mud , used to keep the well 's pressure down , with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $ 750,000 a day and was already running five weeks late , rig survivors told @entity0			1
@entity5 won the argument , said @entity27 , the rig 's chief mechanic			1
" he basically said , ' well , this is how it 's gon na be			1
' " " that 's what the big argument was about , " added @entity31 shortly after the exchange , chief driller @entity35 expressed concern and opposition too , the workers said , and on the drilling floor , they chatted among themselves			1
" i do n't ever remember doing this , " they said , according to @entity41			1
" i think that 's why @entity35 was so reluctant to try to do it , " @entity41 said , " because he did n't feel it was the right way to have things done			1
" @entity35 was among the 11 workers killed when the rig exploded that night			1
in the @entity0 interviews , the workers described a corporate culture of cutting staff and ignoring warning signs ahead of the blast			1
they said @entity5 routinely cut corners and pushed ahead despite concerns about safety			1
the rig survivors also said it was always understood that you could get fired if you raised safety concerns that might delay drilling			1
some co-workers had been fired for speaking out , they said			2
it can cost up to $ 1 million a day to operate a deepwater rig , according to industry experts			1
safety was " almost used as a crutch by the company , " @entity41 said			1
he said he was once scolded for standing on a bucket on the rig , yet the next day , @entity7 ordered a crane to continue operating amid high winds , against its own policies			1
" it 's like they used it against us -- the safety policies -- you know , to their advantage			1
" i do n't think there was ever a plan set in place , because no one ever thought this was gon na ever happen , " he added			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity89 would not comment on specific allegations , saying the company has to " wait for the investigations to be completed			1
we ca n't prejudge them			2
" " @entity5 's priority is always safety , " he said			1
@entity7 , the world 's largest offshore drilling contractor , said its top priority is safety			1
" there is no scenario or circumstance under which it will be compromised , " the company said in a written statement			2
" so critical is safety at @entity7 that every crew member has stop - work authority , a real - time method by which all work is halted should any employee suspect an unsafe situation or operation			1
" in @entity114 on tuesday , rep. @entity112 , the chairman of the @entity113 , sought more answers			0
in a letter to @entity117 , ceo of @entity7 , @entity112 said records from the rig indicate 18 people at work on the second shift with " zero engineers , electricians , mechanics or subsea supervisors " on duty the night of the explosion			1
@entity112 added that payroll records show 20 crewmen , including seven of the 11 men who died , had worked a 24 - hour shift six days before the explosion			0
rig workers typically work 12 - hour days			1
" although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it , when combined with the ongoing @entity5 internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster , i have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of april 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed , or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role , " wrote @entity112 , @entity135 , the chairman of the @entity113			1
@entity112 called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request @entity7 said it would meet			1
but @entity7 said no worker put in a 24 - hour day , and the documents @entity112 cited did n't tell the whole picture			1
@entity164 drilling reports track operations and " certain personnel , " it said , " but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember			0
" " at the time of the accident , the @entity3 and its crew had compiled seven consecutive years of operations without a single lost - time safety incident , " the company said in a written statement			2
" the vessel was properly and professionally manned ; there was no shortage of technical expertise , nor did any crewmember work a 24 - hour shift			0
" @entity0 was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up @entity7 's claim that no employees worked 24 - hour shifts on april 14 , six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig			1
other documents reviewed by @entity0 seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that do n't show up on time sheets , possibly refuting the committee 's claim the rig was shortstaffed on april 20			1
the rig workers have filed a negligence suit against @entity5 , @entity7 , oil field services contractor @entity198 and other companies involved with the deepwater rig			1
" i 've seen gross negligence , and this conduct is criminal , " said @entity201 , the lawyer representing the men			0
" there 's a crime scene sitting 5,000 feet below the water			2
" @entity27 , the rig 's mechanic , had traveled with the rig from @entity210 , where it was made nearly a decade ago			1
he had seen the mechanical crew get downsized over the years			0
yet as the rig aged , the engines began having more problems			2
" it became overwhelming , " he said			0
" we could n't keep up with the flow of it			2
... we constantly over the years kept telling them , ' hey , we need more help back here			0
' " they pretty much just said , ' well , we 'll look into it			0
' " about nine months ago , @entity27 said , he got an additional first engineer , yet the crew was still overloaded with work			0
even more alarming , the rig survivors said , was the amount of resistance the well was giving them			1
" we had problems with it from the day we got on , " @entity231 said			2
nearly every day , @entity231 said , " we had problems with that well			2
" @entity41 said it was like an eerie cloud hung over the well being dug 5,000 feet into the sea			0
" there was always like an ominous feeling , " he said			0
" this well did not want to be drilled			0
... it just seemed like we were messing with @entity244			0
" at times , the drill got stuck			0
many times , it " kicked , " meaning gas was shooting back through the mud at an alarming rate			0
" i 've seen a lot of gas coming up from muds on different wells , and the highest i 've ever seen in my 11 years was 1,500 units			0
and this well gave us 3,000 , " @entity27 said			0
" i 've never been on a well with that high of gas coming out of the mud			0
that was kind of letting me know this well was something to be reckoned with			0
" it all came to a head at 9:56 p.m. , when the first of three explosions rocked @entity3 , 52 miles southeast of @entity270 , @entity271 , with 126 people aboard			0
tiles fell from the ceiling , walls collapsed , and people ran for their lives			0
it reminded @entity279 of the movie " @entity281			0
" " it looked like you was looking at the face of death , " he said			0
" you could hear it , see it , smell it			0
" he scrambled to the lifeboat deck			0
@entity231 had been trained to fight fires aboard the rig			2
but when he looked at the flames shooting 150 feet into the air , he knew there was nothing they could do			0
" there is no way we can put that fire out , " he thought			0
@entity231 hopped in a lifeboat			0
he screamed for co-workers to jump aboard			0
a second explosion rocked the rig			2
the lifeboat , still suspended in the air , went into a free fall of about 3 feet			0
" here i am on a lifeboat that 's supposed to help me get off this rig , " @entity231 thought			1
" and i 'm gon na wind up dying			1
" he bowed his head and prayed			0
now , 50 days later , the survivors are telling their stories			2
it 's become part of their everyday lives			2
they ca n't shake what happened that day , even when they close their eyes at night			1
" it 's like being in a neverending nightmare , " @entity27 said			2
" you dream about it			0
you see it in your sleep			0
then , we wake up in the morning , and we realize it 's not a dream			2
... it does n't end for us			2
" @entity0 's @entity331 contributed to this report			2
