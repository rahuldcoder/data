@entity0 -- @entity2 may be creating a problem for herself			0
in over a year on the paid speaking circuit , @entity4 has addressed recyclers , bankers , doctors , environmentalists , a fair share of @entity11 and a number of other diverse groups			2
her paid speeches have one thing in common : they are regularly to corporate or trade groups that disagree with @entity4 -- or her former colleagues in the @entity21 administration -- on key issues such as health care , environmental policy or taxes			2
while it would be impossible for @entity4 to only speak to groups that agree with her on everything , speaking to organizations that openly disagree with @entity31 on certain issues has proven problematic for @entity4			2
the appearances open the former secretary of state up to attacks from @entity36 and create situations where she appears evasive			0
that was the case again wednesday when @entity4 gave the keynote luncheon talk at @entity41 , the annual conference run by the medical device industry			1
one of the group 's top issues is getting rid of @entity47 's medical device tax , a cause @entity49 , the group 's spokeswoman , called their " premier issue			1
" @entity4 , the prohibitive favorite for her @entity31 ' presidential nomination in 2016 , was less than committal about the issue on wednesday , though			1
she did n't mention the tax by name during her prepared remarks and offered little indication one way or another what she would do about the issue when @entity63 , the association 's president , asked her about it during a question and answer session			1
" i do n't know what the right answer about the tax is , " @entity4 said , " but i think we could , taking a look at everything and not standing there with out arms folding staring at each other across the partisan divide , begin to sort it out			1
" @entity4 seemed to play both sides of the issue , acknowledging the @entity79 needs to look at " the pluses and the minuses " of the law , but also stating that she thinks medical device companies " have an argument to make " against the tax			1
the medical device tax is a 2.3 % excise tax created in part to fund @entity47 ; it went into effect at the beginning of 2013			1
the tax , which is a large component in funding @entity47 , is unpopular with @entity31 and @entity36 alike , especially those with ties to the medical devices industry			1
sizing up a @entity4 - @entity97 race @entity4 heralded a number of @entity47 accomplishments during her speech -- something she regularly does -- but acknowledged that the law is adversely impacting some groups and needs to be altered			1
" i am well aware there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered and changes that are going to be proposed and evaluated because clearly there is more work to be done , " @entity4 said			2
" and your industry is bearing some of the burden alongside other stake holders			0
" she later added , though , " but you are also , in my view , positioned to reap the benefits of those millions of newly insured consumers using ... medical devices			0
" @entity122 will bet you that @entity2 wins in 2016 the response to @entity4 's speech was polite , but far from excited			2
there were no applause lines during the speech and some attendees left the room before she was finished			0
republicans quickly jumped on @entity4 for her answer on wednesday			0
they blasted the video out to reporters shortly after the event and issued a statement earlier in the day that questioned whether @entity4 's speaking at the conference puts her at odds with the @entity21 administration			0
@entity2 's midterm campaign schedule this is not the first time , either , @entity4 has put herself in this position			0
@entity4 appeared before a group opposed to @entity47 in 2013 and has regularly appeared before @entity11 audiences that very much support the @entity151			1
during a handful of visits to @entity11 this year , the former secretary of state has refused to definitively answer questions about the 1,179 - mile - long project that would move oil from @entity11 to refineries in the @entity79			0
" well , you know , i cant really talk about it because i was in the office that has primary responsibility for making the decision , " @entity4 said earlier in the week during an appearance in @entity160			0
" i do n't want to inject myself into what is a continuing process			0
" this answer is similar to what she said during a june even in @entity171 , when @entity4 planted herself squarely in the middle of the issue , telling an audience that " these are people making arguments in good faith , " despite the fact that both sides " may have some facts and not others			2

@entity4 speaks to medical device industry *leaders*
they want an end to tax that helps fund @entity47
@entity4 does n't give definitive stance on issue
