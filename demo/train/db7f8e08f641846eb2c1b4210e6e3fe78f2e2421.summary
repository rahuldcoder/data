-- @entity3 's poor @entity2 run continued on sunday as the @entity5 champions dropped points for the third match in a row and failed to return to the top of the table			1
the @entity11 were deposed at the summit after @entity14 's 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity15 on saturday , but could have returned on goal difference with victory away to mid-table @entity18			1
however , @entity20 's team could only draw 1 - 1 as @entity21 earned a point with an equalizer on the stroke of halftime following @entity27 's early opener for @entity18			1
that gave @entity14 a two - point lead after 15 rounds , leaving @entity3 in second place above @entity33 rivals @entity32 on goal difference			1
@entity34 scores five as @entity14 run riot the match was cleared to go ahead despite the snow that has blanketed the north of @entity39 in the past few days , with @entity18 's suspension - depleted line - up boosted by the presence of veteran former @entity43 defender @entity42 for the first time in the league since joining the promoted club in pre-season			2
the home team -- beaten 5 - 1 by @entity49 last weekend -- took the lead in the sixth minute when recent @entity43 debutant @entity27 took advantage of a mistake by @entity54 defender @entity53 to score his ninth league goal this season			1
@entity53 had a header cleared off the line by @entity59 in the 26th minute , and the equalizer finally came as @entity61 international @entity21 collected a clever pass from @entity63 and twisted his way into the penalty area before firing in a deflected shot			0
@entity3 piled on the pressure in the second half but the closest they came to scoring was when striker @entity69 turned and volleyed in off the post in the 77th minute -- but it was ruled out for a blatant handball by the @entity61			0
@entity20 said @entity3 hope to welcome back @entity43 internationals @entity73 and @entity75 from injuries ahead of next weekend 's clash with @entity78 , while @entity80 midfielder @entity79 returns from suspension			2
" next week for @entity73 and @entity75 will be an important week , they will start to train with the team			0
we have all week to control their condition and i hope that both , maybe more @entity73 than @entity75 , will be able to play against @entity78 , " the @entity83 told the @entity3 website			0
" they are very important , not just as technical players but they have personality , character -- and at this moment we need this kind of player			0
" @entity96 moved into fifth place above @entity49 with a last - gasp 2 - 1 victory at home to @entity100 as @entity101 scored a stoppage - time winner in the later kickoff			1
in the second minute of five added on , the @entity43 winger beat @entity100 defender @entity105 to @entity107 's flick - on and fired past goalkeeper @entity108 to put the @entity33 club within a point of @entity111			2
@entity100 remained on 19 points in 10th place , behind @entity18 on goal difference			1
@entity116 's team had the best of the first half and took the lead through @entity120 in the 42nd minute when the central defender responded quickest after his header hit the back of teammate @entity124			2
@entity124 conceded a penalty on the hour mark when he handled @entity128 's free - kick , but substitute @entity129 -- who replace the injured @entity130 early on -- was wide of the target as the home side missed a fourth spot - kick this season			0
five minutes later @entity120 put through his own net to give @entity96 hope , with the @entity137 attempting to deny the lurking @entity107 the chance to convert @entity140 's teasing low cross			0
@entity43 striker @entity129 had the ball in the net in the 89th minute , but was in an offside position before volleying in @entity101 's header .			0

@entity5 champions @entity3 come from behind to draw 1 - 1 at @entity18
@entity21 's 45th - minute goal *cancels* out @entity27 's early opener
@entity20 's team trail leaders @entity14 by two points after 15 games
@entity96 move into fifth place above @entity49 with a last - gasp 2 - 1 win at home to @entity100
