we all know @entity1 , but @entity3 ' first literary creation , " @entity4 , " not so much			1
in fact , @entity4 's only previous movie credit is 2009 's " a princess of @entity8 , " starring @entity9 ( @entity10 was @entity4 )			1
in this mega-budget @entity12 sci - fi romp he 's played by " @entity13 " discovery @entity14 as a kind of @entity18 prototype			1
this " @entity4 " is a 19th century @entity20 captain who seems mildly perplexed to be transported from an @entity22 cave to @entity8 , or @entity23 , as the locals call it			2
the geology -- and the atmosphere -- are not so different from where he came from , but @entity4 is bewildered to find he seems to have forgotten how to walk ; the gravitational pull is so much weaker on @entity8 , he spends several minutes flopping about in the dirt			2
it 's the kind of purely visual gag that is former @entity34 director @entity33 's forte , a reminder of the slapstick interstellar mayhem he brought to " @entity37 " , and a welcome early signal that he 's not going to let " @entity4 " succumb to the stuffy allegorical earnestness of " @entity40			1
" this is a movie comfortable with its own absurdity			1
at the same time , @entity33 's not going for camp , either -- there 's not even the faintest trace of @entity47 's " @entity48 " style mock rock operatics in @entity51 's symphonic score ( more 's the pity )			0
with its @entity54 flying machines , @entity57 fixtures and archaeological fascination with runes and ruin , " @entity4 " is a curious mash - up of antique pulp and cutting edge @entity64 spectacle -- though that is n't such an unusual combination these days , when digital effects increasingly take us away from the realism that dominated movies for the latter part of the 20th century			2
it 's not a trend that critics seem particularly happy about , but more and more our blockbusters are assuming the imaginative freedom that you find in animation			0
filmmakers are bending the laws of physics just for the joy of it			0
when @entity4 has finally found his feet he realizes he can leap great distances in a single bound -- there 's literally a spring in his step			1
as superpowers go , this one smacks more of @entity92 than @entity93 ( even though it 's enough to encourage @entity23 's three warring tribes to think he might tilt the balance one way or the other )			0
" @entity4 " cast talks to @entity99 elsewhere , @entity33 's design seems under the spell of the enchanting anime movies of @entity104 master @entity103 ( " @entity105 , " " @entity106 " ) : there 's an insatiable city that moves like a crab on legs that pump away like oil wells , a blue - tongued dino - dog scuttles after @entity4 at the speed of a cannonball and scheming mystical spirits shapeshift at will			1
@entity116 and @entity117 are among the actors impersonating the film 's most compelling creations , the @entity121 : giant green vertebrates with boar - like tusks , four arms and a penchant for cruel and unusual punishment			0
@entity33 and his co-writers @entity127 and novelist @entity129 create a reasonably coherent and absorbing alien anthropology for the @entity121 , but the humanoid tribes are generally less interesting , with the partial exception of @entity135 ' @entity134 princess , @entity133 , who is permitted to be self - centered and deceitful as well as feisty and intelligent ( and never once speaks in a high - pitched squeak )			0
mind you , it 's not all good			0
the movie 's plot construction is rickety ; the opening is needlessly confusing , and the heavies ' political machinations did n't make much sense that i could see			1
yes , too , it 's another movie pitched overwhelmingly at teenagers			2
whether they 're prepared to take innocent hokum at face value we will know soon enough , but for all its flaws this is an altogether more idiosyncratic and personable blockbuster than your typical corporate popcorn fodder .			0
