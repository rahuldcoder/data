-- railroad ties , cement pilings and other debris reportedly mark the entrance to @entity5 and @entity8 's rural @entity7 compound , situated on the edge of a wildlife management area marketed by tourism officials as a good spot for hikers , campers and bird watchers			2
look closer and , according to police documents , you 'd see shooting slits cut into the side of the couple 's trailer , maybe even some military - grade ordinance scattered around the property			1
it is there , authorities say , that @entity5 , his wife and eight other members of @entity30 -- a down - on - its - luck white supremacist group -- trained in hand - to - hand combat , drilled in breaking down weapons and practiced shooting them , imagining their targets were n't merely water jugs , but rather the exploding heads of people they hated			1
on monday , authorities said they had arrested the @entity41 and five other members of the group , which is also known by its initials @entity30 , on charges of illegal paramilitary training , attempting to shoot into an occupied dwelling and evidence of prejudice while committing a crime			1
" @entity8 views himself and the other members of the @entity30 as the protectors of the white race , " investigators wrote in an affidavit			1
" @entity8 has stated his intent during the race war is to kill @entity58 , immigrants and other minorities			1
" more immediately , according to police , @entity8 was planning to stage provocative disruptions at the @entity63 and at a @entity65 , @entity7 , anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups			1
@entity8 , the police documents say , wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for @entity30 , which hate - tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader , @entity73 , in @entity75			1
nationally , @entity30 has had a long and violent history , including the beating death of a @entity79 man and a string of 1993 bombings in @entity75 , according to hate - tracking groups			2
the 25 - year - old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under @entity73 , described by the @entity85 as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987			0
but @entity73 was shot to death in his home in march 2011 , leaving the group with no clear leader , according to the @entity93			0
it has shrunk significantly in the past year , according to the @entity85			0
most of the group 's 50 or so members appear to live in @entity7 , according to the @entity93			1
authorities identified the other members arrested last week as @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			2

@entity110 bonded out of jail on saturday , according to @entity113 officials			0
his wife was released on sunday , they said			0
according to police , @entity8 's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of @entity121 and other weapons at the compound , which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway			2
the property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the @entity135 government during a race war , investigators wrote in the affidavit			1
the group was making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation , according to police			0
on at least one occasion , a group member who also belonged to the @entity144 provided training to @entity30 members that he had learned in the military , according to the affidavit			2
the arrests came on the heels of a two - year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound on april 28 , according to the arrest affidavit			0
at a meeting to plan the attack on rival skinheads that day , @entity8 nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had been making of training exercises , according to an affidavit released by police			0
