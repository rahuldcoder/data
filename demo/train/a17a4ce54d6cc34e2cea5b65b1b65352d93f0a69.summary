-- she stands just over 4 feet tall and prowls the stage rasping @entity3 hits			2
but come weekends , you wo n't find @entity6 in the nightclubs partying like a rock star			1
" most short people are at boobie or neck range " with other patrons in the clubs , she explains			2
" i 'm at ass range			2
" such quips are definitive @entity6 , a petite chanteuse who is as self - deprecating as she is earnestly committed to her career as " @entity18 , " an impersonator			1
the singer - actress has found success in combining the uniqueness of being a little person with her determination to become a star			1
who better to portray than @entity3 , who is known for her willingness to traffic in the unexpected ? " @entity3 is so exciting to me because she 's like an animal , " @entity29 says			1
" as long as you are feeling powerful and emotionally driven for the night ... i would say that you are really taking the right steps to becoming ' @entity33			2
' " not that @entity29 does n't consider herself a performer in her own right			1
born in @entity36 to an average - sized family , @entity29 has dreamed of a career in @entity39 for as long as she can remember			1
along with the blond good looks and the big personality one might expect from a @entity42 rose , @entity29 also has achondroplasia , the most common form of dwarfism			1
the pint - sized performer decided early on not to let size stop her			2
" i 've grown up saying , ' lord please , all i want to do is become a singer , ' and i believe he has granted that wish , " @entity29 says			1
" the fact that it 's not exactly what i envisioned does n't mean that i 'm not still envisioning something more grandiose			0
" she first came to the public 's attention in 2003 with an appearance on @entity57 's " @entity56 : i 'm a @entity58 " special , which chronicled her attempts to break into show business			0
after performing as a part of @entity63 for a few years , she had an offer to perform at a party and was surprised that rather than be asked to come as " an @entity67 or something like that , " the client bought into her idea of showing up as " @entity71			0
" that launched her career as a lilliputian look - alike , and soon she was appearing everywhere , from television shows like " csi : @entity76 " to touring with rapper @entity77 and @entity78 and starring in the @entity76 show " @entity79			0
" on the big screen , @entity29 has appeared in films such as " @entity82 " and " @entity83			1
" she now has her own company , " mini-popstars , " with other small impersonators , including " @entity87 , " " @entity88 " and " @entity89			0
" and like any big star , she shies away from talking money and fees ; she 'd much rather focus on how fortunate she feels to be doing what she loves			0
" i truly feel like this is so much like the rest of our lives in that if you believe that you can do it , put effort and work into it , then anything is possible , " she says			0
@entity29 has all the trappings of a celebrity : costume designer , manager , publicist and fans who love to be photographed with her			1
she has met @entity111 ( who @entity29 says could n't have been sweeter ) and a quick search of the @entity113 turns up a picture of @entity115 hanging with @entity29 in her mini-britney gear			1
@entity29 has spent hours volunteering with the nonprofit organization @entity117 , and she has written into her contracts a clause that says if the word " midget " is used she will walk			1
yet there are still some in her community who are n't thrilled by her career			0
" a lot of little people question me and state , ' it 's so demeaning ' and ' i ca n't believe you would do that ; why do n't you just do your own show ? ' " she says			0
" that 's just like telling any other person why do n't you just become your own famous person and see what kind of press you get			2
no matter who you are or what you are doing , you are always going to get some negative reaction			0
" working the stage clearly gives @entity6 a buzz			1
she 's meticulous in her preparations			0
from the makeup to the outrageous costumes , she works hard to achieve the illusion , though she admits she does n't look much like @entity3 or @entity111			0
as for the sound , @entity29 says she sings most of the songs herself -- except for the last number in her act , when she is usually out of breath			1
pulling off @entity3 's " @entity153 " is fairly simple given that the husky tune falls in @entity6 's natural range			1
besides , she says , fans get that she is more tribute performer than spot on			0
the biggest challenge , she says , is trying to replicate @entity3 's sense of style			0
" everyone remembers the nude latex outfit that she wore at the @entity163 when she came out of the egg , " @entity29 says			2
" i could n't find sheets of latex , but i found these heavy shower curtains that i thought would work			0
it was the worst costume malfunction known to man			0
" even though @entity29 sometimes gets confused with other little people like @entity172 , the mother on @entity173 's " @entity172 , " the singer says she enjoys a healthy fan base , especially in the gay community			1
could it only be a matter of time before there is a @entity6 impersonator ? absolutely , if she has her way			2
" this is like the practice round before i actually become the ' @entity185 , ' " she says , laughing .			0
