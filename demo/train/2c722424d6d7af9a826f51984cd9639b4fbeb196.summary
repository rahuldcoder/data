-- sarin gas has been used several times in the @entity4 civil war , including at least once by the @entity6 regime , @entity8 's foreign minister said tuesday , citing results from test samples in @entity8 's possession			1
@entity12 announced that conclusion after meeting with the head of a @entity16 mission set up to establish the facts about the alleged use of chemical weapons in @entity4			1
" i gave him the results of tests carried out by our lab appointed by the @entity28 to identify chemical warfare , " @entity12 said in a statement , referring to the @entity22 scientist professor @entity21			2
" these results show the presence of sarin in the samples that are in our possession , " @entity12 said			2
" in view of these elements , @entity8 now has the certainty that the sarin gas was used in @entity4 several times and in a localized manner			1
" in an interview later tuesday with @entity0 affiliate @entity8 2 , @entity12 blamed the @entity4 government in at least one of the cases			1
" there is no doubt that it is the regime and its accomplices , " @entity12 said			2
he added the @entity8 government examined the chain of events from the moment of the attack through the lab results to determine that government was responsible			0
@entity12 ' announcement did not say when or where the weapons may have been used or who may have used the gas in the other cases			1
@entity4 rebels have been fighting the government for more than two years			0
atrocities have been blamed on both sides			0
the announcement coincided with the release of a draft report posted on the website of the @entity71 that concludes : " there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as weapons			1
the precise agents , delivery systems or perpetrators could not be identified			0
" in @entity81 , @entity80 press secretary @entity79 said the @entity82 was working with the @entity8 and other allies as well as the @entity4 opposition to determine those answers			1
" we need to expand the evidence we have , " he told reporters tuesday			0
" we need to make it reviewable ; we need to have it corroborated before we make any decisions based on the clear violation that use of chemical weapons would represent by the @entity4 regime			1
so , we will continue in that effort			0
" asked how long that might take , he said , " i do n't have a timetable for you			0
" he noted that @entity100 has consistently turned down @entity82 requests for a @entity16 investigative team to be sent to @entity4			0

but president @entity109 said " intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient			0
" in early may , the head of the @entity112 on @entity4 said that evidence points to the use of sarin by @entity4 rebel forces			1
