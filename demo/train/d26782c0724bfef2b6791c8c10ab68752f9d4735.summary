as evidenced by media stories and public awareness campaigns , @entity0 have resolved to get tough on bullying			0
in that spirit , it 's time to send a message to bullies with badges			2
we need to tell police who prey on the vulnerable : " no more ! when you pile on a suspect and beat him to death , we will treat you just like any other alleged criminal			1
we will arrest you and prosecute you			0
and if convicted , you will go to prison for a very long time			0
we will make an example out of you so that other police officers will think twice before abusing their power			1
" the messenger could be the jury that will hear the case against two police officers in @entity24 , @entity25 , a city about 25 miles southeast of @entity26			1
a judge ruled wednesday that the officers will stand trial in the beating death last july of @entity31 , a 37 - year - old homeless man afflicted with schizophrenia			1
cpl. @entity33 is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force			2
officer @entity37 faces the more serious charge of second - degree murder , because prosecutors believe he took a more active role in the assault			0
both officers have pleaded not guilty			2
this week , at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial , prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating			1
the footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on @entity31 ' chest , firing electric shocks from a taser stun gun , all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest			1
early on , @entity37 appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground : " you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f --- you up ! " another police officer is heard saying : " we ran out of options so i got to the end of my taser and i ... smashed his face to hell			2
" by the end of the video , @entity31 is lying in a pool of blood			1
according to prosecutors , the young man suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions			2
he died five days later			0
what we see in that 33 minutes of footage , including a defenseless @entity31 screaming in pain , saying he 's sorry and pleading for help , should never happen in the @entity0			1
when it does happen , it ca n't be tolerated , justified , or excused			0
that 's coming from the son of a retired cop			1
my father wore a badge for 36 years , and he has no stomach for police brutality			2
in fact , about 20 years ago , when another piece of videotape surfaced -- that of the @entity103 beating by police officers in 1991 -- i remember my father telling me that , as far as he was concerned , those out - of - control law enforcement officers wailing on @entity103 had ceased being cops and become little more than thugs and criminals			1
as it turns out , @entity31 ' father is also a retired law enforcement officer			1
after his son died , @entity111 made it his mission to make sure the story got out and would not be forgotten			2
he used social media and the @entity117 to show the world what those officers had done to his son , complete with graphic photos that he took at the side of @entity31 ' hospital bed			1
this is a good dad			0
but he was also , apparently , a good cop who trained fellow deputies on the right way to take down suspects			0
this is the wrong way			0
@entity31 described the officers ' actions as nothing less than a " hate crime against the homeless and mentally ill. " last year , @entity24 city officials offered @entity31 nearly a million dollars to settle the case			1
he turned it down , and instead pushed for a criminal trial			0
this should bring some small comfort to @entity111			0
he has to carry around with him for the rest of his life that , as his son was fighting for his life , he cried out for his father to protect him from these bullies			0
on the video , we hear @entity31 screaming : " @entity151 , help ! they 're killing me ! " as a father myself , those words break my heart			1
" @entity151 , help ! they 're killing me ! " he was killed			0
and now , if the cops are convicted of this crime , they have to pay .			0

two police officers are charged in the beating death last july of @entity31
@entity165 : courts must treat cops the same as any suspected criminals
victim was a homeless mentally ill man , his dad a retired cop with a mission for justice
@entity165 : it 's hard to watch *horrifying* video showing @entity31 begging for his dad
