@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's transit system board agreed wednesday to put together a formal policy on when cell - phone service can be cut off to commuters , in response to widespread complaints and recent protests			1
the @entity12 's board of directors will also have the proposed policy reviewed by the @entity14 and @entity15			1
the board 's decision came during a three - hour special meeting wednesday to discuss the agency 's decision earlier this month to cut off cell - phone signals at certain underground stations to ward off protests			1
that decision ignited a debate about free speech and public safety			0
the board agreed that the new policy would define the kinds of public safety threats warranting a cutoff of commuters ' cell signals			1
developing the new policy could take up to four weeks			0
the proposed policy would also be presented to free - speech groups for their review , board members said			1
@entity40 director @entity39 acknowledged the controversy as a " pr nightmare			1
" she was upset that the board did n't have a say in the staff decision -- which was widely criticized by free - speech advocates			1
" obvious first amendment rights and the right to have a communication are what people are looking for , " @entity39 said			0
" we need to defend first amendment rights to protest us and use cell - phone communication			0
" she found the widespread public criticism " really frustrating -- i 'm held accountable for a staff decision , " she said			2
" if we 're gon na shut off cell phones , it has to be the most extraordinary circumstances that i equate to 9/11 level			1
" on august 11 , demonstrators had planned a rally to bring attention to a number of transit police officer shootings , including the death of 45 - year - old @entity67			1
@entity67 was shot july 3 after a confrontation with officers			0
the transit agency said protests during rush hour endangered the safety of commuters and employees			0
as evidence , they cited a protest on july 11 where demonstrators had used cell phones to coordinate which stations to target			1
that spirited and largely peaceful rally at the city 's @entity85 stop was organized by a group called " no justice , @entity40			2
" but at the demonstration , one person climbed atop a subway train before being pulled down			0
@entity40 also said protesters blocked doors and generally delayed roughly two - thirds of trains running during the rush - hour commute that day			2
as a result , when protesters planned another demonstration on august 11 , the subway system said it cut off cell - phone signals at some stations			1
@entity40 said it did so to prevent protesters from using " mobile devices to coordinate their disruptive activities and communicate about the location and number of @entity108			2
" the august 11 protests never materialized			1
but the decision to cut off signals elicited criticism from civil liberty organizations , the @entity115 's editorial page and others			1
" shutting down access to mobile phones is the wrong response to political protests , whether it 's halfway around the world or right here at home , " the @entity117 of @entity1 said			0
the @entity14 said it is looking into the incident			0
" any time communications services are interrupted , we seek to assess the situation , " @entity14 spokesman @entity126 said last week			0
" we ... will be taking steps to hear from stakeholders about the important issues those actions raised , including protecting public safety and ensuring the availability of communications networks , " @entity130 said			0
last week , hackers attacked @entity40 's website and posted the home addresses and other information of all 102 police officers on the train system 's police force			2
it was n't clear who was to blame for the hacking incident			0
but in a prior hacking incident on august 14 , members of the well - known hacking group @entity149 took credit in online messages for breaking into a link off @entity40 's website			2
the hackers posted information from @entity40 's internal network , including phone numbers of hundreds of people			2
meanwhile , police alternately closed and reopened commuter train stations in downtown @entity4 monday after demonstrators gathered to protest the recent shootings			0
@entity2 's @entity163 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 .			0
