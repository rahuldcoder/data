@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is known for its sunshine , its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese , but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world			1
@entity10 is a dessert wine with a flavor as rich as its history			1
it is originally believed to have been given its name by crusading knights in the 13th century , but to have first been made up to 5,000 years ago			1
it is produced in the fertile high - altitude slopes in the south - west of the island that became known as " @entity21 " during the @entity22			0
around this time , the @entity23 of the @entity24 renamed the local wine after their new protectorate			2
throughout the following centuries , stories of the wine abound			2
according to legend , @entity30 of @entity31 was so taken with commandaria that at his wedding he pronounced it " the wine of kings and the king of wines			1
" equally struck by the intoxicating liquor was the @entity42 king @entity41 who is said to have declared it to be " the @entity44 of wines "			2
over time production continued to grow			0
by 1879 the @entity48 explorer sir @entity49 recorded that @entity1 was annually exporting 155,000 " okes " ( a @entity52 measurement that translates roughly to 230,000 liters ) of commandaria to @entity54 alone			1
all the elements of @entity1 in the coastal town of @entity0 , on the sunny southern coast of @entity1 , the most popular brand of commandaria -- @entity61 @entity60 -- is produced to a recipe that is now protected by a legally enforced appellation , the only one held by @entity1			2
@entity64 , senior oenologist at @entity61 , believes the wine they produce is very special			2
" in it you have all the elements of @entity1 : you have honey , herbs , vanilla , spices , and dried fruits such as plums ... it is very complicated , " he says			2
one distinguishing feature of commandaria is that after the grapes are picked , they are left in the sun for ten days , which increases the density of their sugars			0
the grapes are then pressed , the wine is fortified ( usually with a high percentage grape - based alcohol ) and then it is aged for at least two years in oak barrels before being bottled			2
as the years roll by , the amber liquid intensifies in both viscosity and sweetness			0

the cavernous @entity61 vaults currently house 400,000 liters of commandaria with a range of vintages ; the oldest batch dates back over a century			0
ancient heritage , modern interpretation archaeological digs , conducted over the past decade , have unearthed evidence that the history of wine in @entity1 stretches back not just hundreds , but thousands of years			1
some believe that @entity1 may have been the site of the earliest wine harvests in @entity118 , stretching back 5,000 years			1
alongside the mainstream labels producing commandaria , a new generation of winemakers is looking to this more distant history to try to get in touch with the country 's original viniculture			0
one such winemaker is @entity128 who has vineyards in the high hills near the village of @entity133			0
the two grapes he uses -- @entity135 a red grape , and @entity137 a white -- have long been used to produce the island 's famous sweet wine			1
but when @entity128 talks of @entity1 wine , he speaks of " @entity142 " , the more ancient name for what the crusading knights of the 13th century came to call commandaria			1

" i 'm working on the base of tradition , but i 'm trying to involve oenology , which is a contemporary science , " he says			0
throughout his career , @entity159 has worked in wineries around the world , and in his view , @entity1 is unique in its ability to grow sweet wine			1
" i truly believe that terroir ( the geology and climate of a place ) is one of the most important things towards producing a high quality wine , " he says			0
" that is why nobody in the world can produce a @entity175 like @entity176 in @entity177 , or a @entity178 like @entity179			0
that is the reason why i strongly believe that @entity1 is one of the rarest terroirs that can produce such high quality sweet wines			1
it is the sun and the soil			0
" so does @entity159 believe that his wine tastes the same as the nama that was being enjoyed in @entity1 5,000 years ago ? " i think that historians can tell stories and can give you an idea about the past , but senses can not be transmitted through history			1
so we can not understand how an ancient nama smelled or tasted , " @entity159 says			0
" my mentality is that we are walking on the base of tradition , on the base of the things transported from generation to generation -- the tales , the feelings -- but the best thing we can do is to give the vine the opportunity to choose for itself what kind of product it wants to create			0
those vines have been there for 150 years ... i am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine			2
" @entity2 's @entity220 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity2 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity10 is recognised as the oldest named wine in the world
the sweet wine has been grown in @entity1 for over 5,000 years
in 1191 , @entity30 called it ' the wine of kings and the @entity236 of wines '
