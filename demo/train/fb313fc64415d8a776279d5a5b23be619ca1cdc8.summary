@entity1 governors are working every day to grow and strengthen a middle class that 's been under assault from global economic forces and failed , trickle - down policies for decades			1
in furtherance of that mission , we will be proud to stand with president @entity9 , @entity11 gov. @entity10 and @entity13 gov. @entity12 at @entity14 this afternoon to announce actions we 're taking to raise the minimum wage in our states to $ 10.10 an hour by 2017			1
@entity19 @entity18 continue to block progress on this critical issue for middle class families			2
but that does n't mean this common - sense idea , like so many others before it , needs to die a @entity27 - inflicted death			2
with a paralyzed @entity28 , @entity1 governors will act			2
we 'll do so with the benefit of having the @entity31 people on our side			0
democrats , @entity18 and independents alike overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage			1
a recent @entity38 / @entity37 poll shows 63 % of @entity31 support it			2
here 's why : @entity41 , it makes good economic sense			0
the federal minimum wage is currently $ 7.25 an hour			1
adjusted for inflation , that 's lower than it was in 1968			2
raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour nationally will provide 28 million @entity31 with more money to spend and to invest , increasing economic activity and growth			1
in fact , recent studies conclude that raising the minimum wage makes workers more productive and therefore helps businesses retain profitability -- a conclusion affirmed by @entity59 's recent decision to raise the minimum wage for its employees to $ 10.10 an hour			1
two , it 's good for women			0
women account for roughly two - thirds of workers whose incomes would rise by increasing the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour			1
these women currently work 40 hours a week to make just $ 14,500 a year			0
these women are our daughters , sisters and mothers who are often the only breadwinners in their families			0
our country is in a stronger position when women are in a stronger economic position			0
we need to make that a reality			0
@entity81 , it 's the right thing to do			0
no @entity31 working 40 hours or more a week deserves to live in poverty			0
@entity18 governors across the country have also stood in the way of progress			1
some have pandered to stereotype , suggesting that a raise in the minimum wage should be rejected because it would only help young workers rather than acknowledging that 88 % of workers who would be affected by moving the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour are over the age of 20 , and more are over the age of 55 than are teenagers			1
@entity99 gov. @entity98 and @entity101 gov. @entity100 went so far as to veto minimum wage hikes in their states			1
@entity105 gov. @entity104 mocked the idea , while @entity108 gov. @entity107 described how the proposal makes him " cringe			0
" @entity111 gov. @entity110 , @entity113 gov. @entity112 and @entity115 gov. @entity114 all oppose this common - sense change			0
and of course there is billionaire @entity119 , running in @entity120 , who went so far as to suggest slashing minimum wage workers ' salaries by a dollar an hour in order to keep the state " competitive			2
" they just do n't get it			0
just look at @entity128 , former @entity129 chair and current governor of @entity131 , who recently said -- in a widely - criticized partisan outburst outside the @entity19 -- that raising the minimum wage was equivalent to " waving the white flag of surrender " on the economy			1
but it 's what the tea party wants to hear			0
a fair minimum wage was once an issue upon which @entity18 and @entity1 leaders could agree			1
but now , the @entity28 and @entity18 governors have embraced partisanship and right - wing ideology rather than economic growth			1
and that 's why we are standing with president @entity9 today to make clear we wo n't wait for @entity18 to come around -- we 're going to give hard - working @entity31 a raise and we are going to start today			2
join us on @entity153 / @entity152 .			0

@entity1 @entity155 . @entity157 and @entity158 support raising the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10
they argue it has n't increased in real dollars since 1968
@entity18 governors , they say , have stood in the way of or tried to roll back the minimum wage
