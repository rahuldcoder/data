-- @entity2 team is facing a million dollar question -- and it has decided to ask the audience			2
after another bruising on - track encounter between its drivers @entity7 and @entity8 at the @entity10 @entity9 , @entity2 is considering introducing team orders for the remaining seven races			1
the team 's head of motorsport @entity15 described sunday 's lap two clash , which effectively ended @entity7 's race and @entity8 's chance of victory , as " unacceptable			1
" " it has been our clear policy to let the drivers race this year but rule number one is : do n't hit each other , " @entity15 told reporters in @entity23			0
" to see that kind of contact , so early in the race , is an unacceptable level of risk to be taking out on track			0
" it can not -- and will not -- happen again			0
" to make sure it does n't , @entity2 asked its half a million @entity38 followers for advice on thursday			1
" team orders or free racing ? there has been a lot of debate since @entity10 -- this is a chance to have your say , " it asked via @entity38			1
it then posted two options , one in favor of team orders and another in favor of free racing			2
fans were asked to vote on the issue by either retweeting or marking their preferred option as a favorite			0
the team then announced the result of the vote after four hours of voting , revealing 92 % of the audience wanted the drivers to be allowed to continue to race each other			2
proving just how thorny the issue of team orders is in @entity68 , @entity2 then asked : " to those who would prefer to see team orders implemented , how would you employ them ? " to the 92 % in favor of free racing , what sanctions would you impose for breaking the ' no contact ' rule ? would you suspend a driver for a race and not maximize constructors ' points ? perhaps you 'd set the order at qualifying slots ? " @entity8 and @entity7 are locked in an intense rivalry for the 2014 world title			1
the @entity85 is now 29 points -- more than a race win -- ahead of his @entity89 rival and former teenage friend			0
it seems when it comes to solving the problem at @entity2 there are no easy answers , even for the team itself .			0
