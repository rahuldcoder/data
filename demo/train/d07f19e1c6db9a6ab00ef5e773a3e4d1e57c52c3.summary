@entity0 , @entity1 -- a group of gay and lesbian @entity5 has traveled to the site of the @entity5 convention this week to help convince its party that it is time to stop being on the " wrong side " of the same - sex marriage issue			1
@entity13 president @entity12 says " momentum is on our side			2
" " clearly , the tide is turning , " said @entity17 , communications director for the @entity13			2
" it 's important for the @entity5 to be inclusive on this issue , because we are at risk of being on the wrong side of history			0
" although the group 's president , @entity12 , acknowledges that few politicians in either party support " marriage equality , " as the group dubs the same - sex marriage issue , " it 's clear momentum is on our side			1
" @entity12 and other @entity13 pointed to a poll indicating that the party is starting to move closer to their positions			2
a @entity38 / @entity37 poll released monday found that 49 percent of the delegates to the @entity5 convention support allowing same - sex marriages or civil unions			1
the poll 's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
a @entity47 conducted in may found that nearly half of those surveyed supported either same - sex marriages or civil union			1
twenty - four percent supported same - sex marriages , while 27 percent backed civil unions			1
forty - three percent backed neither option			0
the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
despite his opposition to same - sex marriage , the @entity13 said they endorsed sen. @entity60 , the @entity5 's presumptive @entity5 presidential nominee , on tuesday because he embraces an approach to politics they want their party to return to			1
@entity60 is an " inclusive @entity5 who believes that our party needs to get back to our core unifying principles that lead us to victory in the ' 90s , " @entity17 said , noting that the @entity69 @entity5 has had a long relationship with the @entity13			1
" he 's a very inclusive @entity5 , a different type of @entity5 , " @entity12 said " at the same time , we have honest disagreements on some issues			0
" in making its endorsement , the group pointed to the @entity69 senator 's opposition to a federal constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as being a man and a woman			2
the amendment has strong support from social conservatives and would have reversed the decisions by @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 to allow same - sex marriages			2
" that took a lot courage for a senator from a red state to buck his own party , " @entity17 said			0
although @entity60 personally opposes same - sex marriage , he voted against the amendment , in part , because he believes the issues should be left to the states			1
" @entity60 stood up for us ... and i want to stand up for @entity60 , " said @entity100 , a director of a fine arts foundation in @entity102 , @entity103			0
" he does n't care about my sexuality			0
he cares that i am an @entity106			0
" he 's teachable , " @entity100 added			0
despite her positions on gay rights issues being largely unknown , @entity12 said , the @entity13 were also satisfied with @entity60 's choice of running mate , @entity113 gov. @entity112			1
unlike @entity60 , @entity112 has expressed support for the @entity115 , but @entity12 said the group was comfortable with her being on the @entity5 ticket because of her 2006 decision to veto a bill that would have banned the state from providing benefits to same - sex partners of employees			1
" she 's a great choice , " @entity100 said			0
" we 're learning more every day , but what we know , we like			0
" although @entity112 was as blank slate for the @entity13 , the group was extremely happy that @entity60 did not choose @entity129 , a former @entity86 governor and presidential candidate who was often mentioned as being on @entity60 's short list of vice presidential choices , @entity17 said			1
while on the campaign trail , @entity129 often railed against his home state 's decision to allow same - sex marriages			2
" we would have had a problem ... if sen. @entity60 would have chosen someone who used gay people as a wedge issue , " @entity17 said .			1
