-- a car bomb killed at least four people in @entity4 , @entity5 , authorities said			1
it was the first time a car bomb has been used to attack federal police , said the city 's mayor , @entity9			2
the incident happened about 8 p.m. thursday in the city 's most violent zone			0
@entity4 municipal police spokesman @entity14 said friday that federal police were responding to a call that a police officer had been killed			1
" when they went to check the car , there was a dead body in there , dressed up like a police officer , but it was n't one of ours , " @entity14 said			1
" they put him in a civilian car but dressed him up in a municipal police uniform			2
that 's when the bomb went off			0
it 's like an act of terrorism			0
" two police officers , a paramedic and a civilian were killed , federal police spokesman @entity33 said			0
six people , including a local news cameraman , were injured in the blast , authorities said			0
four people -- three paramedics and a civilian -- were still being treated for injuries , police said			0
it was unclear how severe the injuries are			0
canal 5 video footage from moments after the blast captures seconds of confusion , followed by fires and debris scattered across the street			0
at one point , the cameraman shooting the video reaches for an injured civilian , and a police officer says , " grab onto my arm			1
" although @entity5 authorities say the attack was the result of a car bomb , a counterterrorism expert said there is " some confusion " about exactly what caused the car to explode			1
" for this to be an improvised grenade attack , in some capacity , it does n't surprise me , " said @entity68 , vice president of intelligence at @entity70 , a privately owned global intelligence service			0
but if this particular car bomb was manufactured to the level of sophistication similar to those used by terrorist groups like @entity80 , then this is a significant event , @entity68 said			0
" the devil is in the details , " he added			0
@entity83 , a security analyst based in @entity85 , @entity86 , called friday 's bombing a " turning point " in @entity5 's drug war and found it remniscent of @entity86 's own battle with cartels and car bombs in the 1990s			1
" because if they decide to start using car bombs one against the other ... then the whole society , bystanders , innocent people could be affected , " he told @entity0			1
he said that while friday 's car bombing did not appear very sophisticated , he noted that @entity5 drug cartels are often advised by former members of @entity86 cartels			1
he said the @entity86 cartels are influenced by @entity101 , the guerrilla group which has waged war against the @entity86 government for decades and " has a lot of experience with explosives			0
" " we could expect more sophistication day after day if they decided to go on with these car bombs , " he said			2
according to @entity14 , the @entity4 cartel claimed the deadly incident in a graffiti message found in downtown @entity4			1
in what appears to be black spray paint , the violent drug cartel wrote , " what happened on september avenue will keep happening to all the authorities who keep supporting @entity121			2
sincerely - the @entity4 cartel			1
" the threatening message concluded : " we still have car bombs			1
" " this is significant because usually it 's @entity129 , the @entity111 's operatives , that sign the messages , " @entity126 said			0
" it 's as if to say , ' now , it 's the big guys in charge , not the operatives			0
' " @entity33 said the blast in the @entity5 border city took place as authorities were responding to " some sort of emergency			2
" earlier in the day , police announced the arrest of @entity146 @entity145 , believed to be a leader in the @entity4 cartel -- one of two drug trafficking organizations operating in the area			1
there had been relative calm in the city since elections were held there july 4			0
but thursday 's explosion and an attack sunday against @entity5 federal police mark the third and fourth major incidents in recent weeks			1
on june 29 , a shooting between suspected drug traffickers and @entity5 federal police left one officer dead			1
the shooting was seen as a watershed moment in the ongoing border drug war : several bullets from that gunfight strayed across the border into @entity168 , hitting @entity169			2
there were no injuries reported on the @entity173 side			0
on april 24 , six federal police officers were killed in a daylight shooting in @entity4			2
hours later , a painted message found in the city , allegedly from members of @entity129 , claimed responsibility for the attack			1
@entity129 is an extension of the @entity4 cartel , made up in part of former @entity4 police officers , according to authorities			1
assaults against federal police have increased since they took full control of security in the city from the @entity5 military on april 9			2
" there have been at least a dozen , maybe 15 , attacks against the federal police since we took over " security , @entity33 said			0
the @entity4 cartel and the @entity197 have been in a bloody turf war since 2008			1
more than 5,000 people have been killed in drug - related violence in @entity4 during the turf war , according to local authorities			2
@entity0 's @entity202 and @entity0 en @entity204 's @entity203 contributed to this story .			0
