-- according to a recent @entity3 report , insects could be a solution to some of the world 's food and health problems			1
they 're nutritious , eco-friendly and abundant			0
many countries already consider them a staple part of their diets			0

come nightfall , at any given outdoor market or busy road there will usually be at least one vendor with a pushcart loaded up with insect snacks , making many tourists squirm and others lick their lips			0
maybe you 're in the mood for some fried crickets			0
or perhaps it 's the pile of bamboo worms that has you salivating			1
these bug vendors serve up to a dozen varieties of insects , which are usually fried in vegetable oil then sprayed with soy sauce to add some zing			2
to locals , and some expats , these foods are not out of the ordinary -- they 're part of the many meals on offer			0
