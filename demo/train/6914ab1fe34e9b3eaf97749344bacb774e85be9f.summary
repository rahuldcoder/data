-- before memories begin fading of the funny , feisty , combative former mayor of @entity5 , @entity1 would do well to pause one last time , and remember the greatest achievement of the late @entity7 : his extraordinary , multi-billion - dollar program of building low - cost , affordable housing			1
it 's easy to lose perspective on the legacy of this larger - than - life character			0
as host of @entity5 's only nightly political show , i got to sit and talk with @entity7 every tuesday night for the last two years , when he appeared on our " @entity24 " segment , a weekly forum for retired politicians to weigh in on the issues of the day			1
@entity7 's final appearance came less than three weeks before he died -- and to the very end , he was a dazzling showman , always ready with a quip , a quarrel or a crusade			2
all of us will miss him terribly			0
but we should n't miss the main lesson of his mayoralty : investing in low - cost housing helped families , preserved neighborhoods , and saved a city			1
and it might be used to do the same for the rest of the country			0
in 1977 , the year @entity7 was elected mayor , @entity5 had been devastated by waves of arson , abandonment and economic decline , leaving entire neighborhoods strewn with rubble and vacant shells where apartments once stood			1
a front - page story in the @entity51 captured the scene when president @entity53 made a dramatic , unannounced trip to @entity55 in the @entity56 to see " block after block of burned - out and abandoned buildings , rubble - strewn lots and open fire hydrants			0
" opinion : @entity7 , a friend and force to the end @entity7 , who was elected a month after @entity53 's " sobering " visit , scrambled to organize a response to the blight but encountered a roadblock a few years later , when the @entity70 administration effectively ended federal support for low - income housing , replacing a longstanding program with rent vouchers for the poor			1
as the federal government got out of the housing business , @entity7 decided that @entity5 would get in -- and get in big			1
in 1985 , he announced a $ 4.4 billion plan to create 100,000 units of subsidized housing over a 10 - year period , a number that later expanded to 252,000 units that eventually cost $ 5.1 billion			0
it required massive rezoning of the city and coordination between multiple agencies			0
more importantly , it deployed @entity5 's capital budget , normally used to pay for sidewalks , roads , bridges and government buildings			2
@entity7 put the full faith and credit of the city on the line , borrowing the billions needed for rebuilding and trusting that a general economic recovery would provide the funds to repay bondholders			2
it was a gutsy move , coming barely a decade after @entity5 's near - bankruptcy			2
tweeters loved @entity7 's ' @entity5 - iness ' but the plan was a spectacular success			1
a veritable army of nonprofit , community - based housing developers worked in partnership with the city to reclaim and rebuild apartments , and neighborhoods like the @entity56 , @entity113 and @entity114 slowly reversed pernicious patterns of decline			2
some who had been homeless left the streets and got their lives back on track , while middle - class families moved back in and began paying taxes , raising families and supporting local businesses			0
ironically , it was the very neighborhoods @entity7 saved that provided the votes that speeded his political downfall , with the election of @entity131 as @entity5 's first black mayor in 1989			1
but @entity131 and every other mayor since @entity7 has sworn allegiance to the housing plan , using the capital budget and alliances with community organizations to build and subsidize workforce housing			1
eulogists remember @entity7 it 's surprising that more cities have n't followed @entity7 's example			1
year after year , for decades , @entity5 has produced or rehabilitated 15,000 units of affordable housing			1
in some years , it has spent more on housing than the next 50 cities combined			0
compare modern @entity114 or @entity113 to the most troubled sections of cities like @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153 , and you see what a difference a massive housing program can make			0
we 'll all miss @entity7 terribly			0
it would be a shame to miss a chance to spread his greatest triumph to other cities around the nation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 : building affordable housing in @entity5 was a @entity7 feat ; other cities should follow
he says @entity7 made major investment in housing to raise up families , neighborhoods
he says @entity7 did this at a blighted time in @entity5 when fed housing support dried up
louis : @entity5 continues to lead in *spending* on rehabs , new housing , a @entity7 legacy
