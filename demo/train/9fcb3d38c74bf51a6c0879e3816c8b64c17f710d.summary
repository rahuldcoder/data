in @entity2 on tuesday , @entity1 gov. @entity0 called for more @entity4 involvement in @entity5 to fight @entity6 , and praised the @entity9 's @entity8 allies for everything from their love of defending freedom to the boy band @entity14			1
@entity0 's foreign policy address at the @entity16 , a @entity8 national security think tank , was greeted with laughs and applause -- especially when he highlighted reasons @entity9 get along so well with their @entity22 - speaking friends across the pond			1
" it 's not just because to @entity9 , you always sound so darn smart and refined no matter what you 're saying , " he said			2
" and it 's not just because of your many cultural exports from @entity29 to @entity30 to @entity31 to @entity14 -- well , that might be a bit of a mixed bag			0
so many good things in the world began in @entity8 , and so many good things in the world to this day depend on @entity8			2
" @entity0 's stop in @entity2 comprises the first leg of his @entity42 excursion this week , which also includes visits to @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
the purpose of his trip is to explore trade opportunities between @entity1 and the @entity42 countries , according to a press release from @entity0 's office			1
his decision to travel away from @entity1 as a second case of @entity55 was diagnosed there has drawn the ire of top @entity59 operative @entity58 , who called the governor an " irresponsible leader , " according to @entity63 news			2
@entity0 , referring to himself as a " proud patriotic @entity1 , " outlined a moral argument in favor of robust @entity4 intervention in @entity5 by drawing a stark contrast between the " so - called religious warriors of @entity6 " and the " special strength and character " of @entity4 forces			1
" to see to it that security is defended -- that is what is required of @entity4 nations and the great alliances we have formed , " he said , admitting that the overseas conflict " will draw heavily on our wealth , our will and our wisdom			0
" " the plainest imperative of all is the resources we commit to the common defense , holding nothing back if it will better insure our security			0
" he called out his political adversaries at home -- and even the @entity91 -- for their reluctance to get involved in foreign affairs			0
" this attitude of cultural relativism , it certainly does n't approve of harsher violent actions , " he said , " but it does question the right of @entity8 , the @entity9 or other western powers to do anything about it			1
" toward the latter half of his address , @entity0 got emotional about the plight of innocent people living in the @entity106 war zone , lowering his voice and pausing periodically for effect			0
" who can not identify with the mother or the father running with their baby , or with an elderly woman who is struggling to keep up with the others ? " he asked , drawing similarities between @entity5 civilians and victims of bombings over @entity2 during @entity118 " who ca n't identify with the children who got away but saw what happened to their parents ? " " and when they look up and they see and @entity128 or a @entity129 or an @entity9 bomber , they feel precisely as you and i would feel			2
the sight must seem like an answer to a prayer , a prayer that can be understood in every faith : save my family			0
save me from this evil			0
