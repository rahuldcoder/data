considering what @entity9 has been through we think she 's doing as well as can be expected , " dr. @entity36 , a vet at the hospital , told @entity29			1
@entity36 said @entity9 is battling severe lung damage and is not strong enough to breathe on her own yet			2
the doctors had hoped to get her off the ventilator by now , but as of sunday night , it just was n't happening			0
" it 's not unexpected that she 's not ready to come off ( the ventilator )			0
it 's just that in our best case scenario ( we thought ) maybe we could 've hoped to get her off ( sunday ) afternoon , " @entity36 told @entity29			0
" whenever they put a patient on a ventilator they 're looking at a 50 - 50 chance of getting them off breathing on their own			0
the smoke ventilation cases are often the hardest to manage off the ventilator			0
" despite her breathing problems , @entity9 has shown improvement in other areas			2
she is mentally alert and showing no signs of neurological problems , the vet said			0
she 's very heavily sedated so that she wo n't fight -- you know , that she 's got a tube down her trachea or windpipe			0

dr. @entity93 , another vet at the hospital who is caring for the dog , told @entity29 she was not at all surprised that @entity9 tried to save her owner			1
" a lot of dogs instinctively know when there 's a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go to try to protect their owners , so she very well may have been trying to protect him , " she said .			0
