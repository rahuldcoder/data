@entity1 has stepped up the use of children in its bloody campaign of terror , the @entity0 says -- subjecting them to horrors that include putting price tags on them to sell as slaves			1
a report released this week focused on children in @entity14 , as well as the responsibility of that nation 's government for ensuring the safety and security of young civilians in the conflict			1
but it certainly does n't preclude similar things happening in @entity24 , where @entity1 is also entrenched and also has been blamed for various atrocities			0
in reference to @entity14 , at least , the @entity0 report found that the terrorist group is resorting more and more to brutal acts such as enslaving , raping , beheading , crucifying and burying people alive			1
some of those affected are children			1
" we have had reports of children , especially children that are mentally challenged , who have been used as suicide bombers , most probably without them even understanding what has happened or what they have to expect , " said @entity34 , an expert with the @entity35			1
some as young as age 8 are getting training to become soldiers , she said			0
" children of minorities have been captured in places where the so - called @entity50 has its strength , have been sold in market with tags , price tags on them , have been sold as slaves , " @entity34 said			1
people of the @entity58 faith -- which draws from @entity59 , @entity60 and the ancient monotheistic religion of @entity62 , and which some @entity63 consider devil worship -- have long faced persecution , though by comparison @entity1 ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary			0
@entity69 adviser @entity68 , for instance , has said @entity58 " women have been treated like cattle , ... subjected to physical and sexual violence , including systematic rape and sex slavery			0
" yazidi children have n't fared much better at the hands of @entity1			1
an earlier @entity0 report described how militants rounded up all @entity58 males " older than 10 years of age at the local school , took them outside the village by pickup trucks , and shot them			1
" the @entity0 report , while alarming , is n't surprising considering all the accounts of @entity1 ' brutality in recent years			1
the self - proclaimed @entity89 has made a name for itself -- in its quest to form a vast caliphate governed under a strict version of @entity95 law -- both through its conquests and its savagery			2
the savagery was on display again this week with the release of video showing @entity106 pilot @entity104 being burned to death , the latest example of @entity1 not just executing its captives but broadcasting such violence as propaganda			0
while there was no response specifically to the @entity0 report , @entity1 has in the past attempted to justify atrocities -- including the enslaving , raping and selling of captives -- as being done in @entity119 's name			1
the terror group printed a pamphlet last fall , then distributed it in @entity122 in december , entitled " @entity123 on female slaves and their freedom			1
" it spells out rationales for having sex with prepubescent girls and generally capturing those who are " nonbelievers , " i.e. they do n't subscribe to @entity1 ' extreme take on @entity133			0
@entity1 : enslaving , having sex with ' unbelieving ' women , girls is ok as such , the @entity1 document claims , " it is permissible to buy , sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves , for they are merely property			0
" the @entity0 report was n't just critical of @entity1			1
it also urged the @entity14 government -- which , along with neighboring @entity24 , is fighting the @entity147 extremist group -- to do more to protect children , saying the @entity14 forces are contributing to the problem			1
a " very large number of children " have been killed and severely injured by airstrikes , shelling and military operations by @entity14 forces , the report said			1
still , it 's @entity1 that is beneath all others involved in the fray when it comes to barbarity			0
not only has the group not apologized for its actions , but it 's reveled in them			2
and it 's used to children to drive home this point			2
an @entity1 propaganda video released last month -- one that @entity2 could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head			0
the boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol high			0
and last august , a photo posted to @entity180 from an @entity1 stronghold showed a 7 - year - old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , " that 's my boy			2
" @entity1 has featured children as fighters before , calling them the " cubs of the caliphate " ( the adult jihadis call each other " lions " ) and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families			2
it has taken over schools to indoctrinate children			2
@entity198 claims @entity1 and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions			2
" that children celebrate such violence is horrifying enough , as evidenced by an @entity1 video showing a young boy watching @entity104 's killing			0
since the propaganda video is carefully orchestrated , @entity2 has no way of knowing whether the boy was coerced			0
in it , the child looks up as if in awe and says he would " burn the pilot " himself if he had a chance			0
he adds , " all @entity220 tyrants should also be burned			0
" @entity2 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
