@entity0 -- @entity2 faces a period of uncertainty and political horse trading tuesday after parliamentary elections left no party in a clear position to form a government			1
the center - left coalition headed by @entity11 won by a narrow margin in @entity2 's lower house of parliament , according to final figures released by the @entity16			1
but @entity11 's coalition , with 29.54 % of the vote , finished less than half a percentage point ahead of the anti-austerity center - right coalition headed by controversial three - time prime minister @entity21 , which garnered 29.18 %			1
it was a similar story in @entity2 's upper house , where the lack of a clear majority means that no one has a firm enough mandate to govern the country			2
final results showed the center - left winning the @entity32 with 31.63 % of the vote , compared with the center - right 's 30.72 % -- an outcome that points to stalemate because of the way @entity32 seats are distributed			1
" this is a case of gridlock , " said @entity37 of the @entity38			1
" nothing could be worse for @entity42			1
" international concern is high that @entity2 -- the third - largest economy in the eurozone and the eighth - biggest in the world -- could face fresh elections if no coalition government can be formed			2
in any case , a weak government would probably struggle to push through the tough reforms many observers feel are needed to get the economy back on track			1
symbolizing @entity2 ' own unhappiness with austerity and their political leaders , a quarter of the vote in the lower house went to the anti-establishment @entity61 protest movement led by comedian @entity63 , who has said he wo n't join forces with any established political parties			1
a bloc led by @entity67 , the former head of a technocrat government that steered @entity2 through the worst of the eurozone crisis last year , trailed badly in fourth place			1
markets reacted negatively to the uncertainty tuesday , with fears about the eurozone crisis coming once more to the fore after months during which confidence had grown			2
even if @entity11 can form a workable coalition , governing will be very difficult , and investors are concerned that a stalemate in the @entity32 could undermine the progress @entity2 has made in overhauling its troubled economy			2
@entity42 markets , including @entity83 , were sharply lower in morning trading , while @entity86 markets also retreated			1
@entity88 stocks fell monday amid the concerns about @entity2 , with the @entity90 and @entity91 500 suffering their biggest one - day declines of the year			0
@entity88 stock futures were indicating a rebound for stocks at the open on tuesday			0
can the @entity96 pull @entity2 out of the mire ? voter turnout was lower than anticipated sunday , the first day of balloting , down from 62.55 % in 2008 to 55.17 % this year , @entity2 's @entity99 news agency reported			2
weather , in part , appeared to cause the lower voter turnout , the news agency said			2
it was snowing in portions of northern @entity2 and raining in the southern part of the country			0
@entity110 - building @entity2 's political system encourages the forming of alliances			0
but if neither @entity11 nor @entity21 can build a strong enough coalition to govern , @entity2 could face another round of elections			1
@entity63 : clown prince of @entity2 politics the center - left alliance dominated by @entity11 's @entity119 also includes the more left - wing @entity120			0
it was widely assumed ahead of the vote that the center - left would join forces with @entity67 's bloc , but its disappointing showing means that even together , they can not command a majority in the upper house			2
@entity11 held a clear lead in polling in the weeks ahead of the vote but saw it slip away in the final days of the campaign			0
@entity37 , the analyst , said ahead of the vote that the left had suffered from a lack of leadership , which prevented it from putting forward a clear picture			1
@entity11 , 61 , comes across as " bluff and homespun , and that 's part of his appeal -- or not , depending on your point of view , " said @entity37			1
the center - right alliance led by @entity21 's @entity147 , or @entity148 , in coalition with the right - wing , anti-immigration @entity150 , made up significant ground in the final days of campaigning			1
@entity21 gave conflicting signals as to whether he was running for the premiership , indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won , but contradicting that on other occasions			1
in a phone interview tuesday with @entity2 journalist and tv host @entity161 , he said everyone had tried their best to help their country			0
" the difference this time is that we were n't able to see through to the end and win , " @entity21 said			1
he acknowledged that the confused result has done nothing to help market confidence			0
but , he added , " i do n't think @entity67 will be able to form any type of coalition with his policy of austerity and his dangerous economic policies that have hurt @entity2			1
" unless either @entity11 or -- even less likely -- @entity21 can persuade @entity63 to enter an alliance , their options are limited			1
@entity63 , the 64 - year - old known as the " clown prince " of @entity2 politics , has been outspoken in his criticism of @entity21 and other politicians in the three years since he founded his party , known as @entity61			1
@entity1 ireporter @entity186 , an @entity2 art curator , said she was very disappointed by the outcome of the election			2
" yesterday when i saw the result i was completely without words , " she said			0
" i think we in @entity2 will go again to vote because it 's impossible to govern a state in this situation , ( where ) we do n't have a majority			2
" she believes many voters hold @entity67 responsible for @entity2 's current debt crisis without remembering the dire economic situation he inherited when @entity21 resigned in 2011			1
at the same time , @entity11 failed to gain people 's confidence , she said			0
" @entity63 has many votes because people are angry and frustrated , " @entity186 said			0
" people in @entity2 are completely disappointed by the situation we see day - by - day , by corruption , scandals			0
" such is voters ' disillusion that @entity186 believes @entity63 could garner enough votes in fresh elections to win outright			1
@entity21 's troubles @entity21 , the septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed " @entity21 , " campaigned as a @entity83 court weighed his appeal against a tax fraud conviction , for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year			2
the verdict has still to be delivered ; however , under the @entity2 legal system , he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court			0
because the case dates to july 2006 , the statute of limitations will expire this year , meaning there is a good chance that none of the defendants will serve any prison time			0
@entity2 parliamentarians are elected for five - year terms , with the current one due to end in april			0
but in december , the @entity148 withdrew its support of the reformist government led by @entity67 , saying it was pursuing policies that " were too @entity235 - centric			2
" @entity67 subsequently resigned , and the parliament was dissolved			0
@entity2 's economy has stagnated for years , and suffered the biggest contraction of any @entity240 nation in 2012 -- it shrank by 2.2 %			0
last week , the @entity241 said it would contract by a further 1.0 % this year , double the rate it had previously forecast			0
meanwhile , unemployment will rise to 11.6 % in 2013 , according to the @entity241 , and then 12 % next year			0
@entity1 's @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 reported from @entity0			0
@entity247 wrote and reported in @entity248			0
@entity249 also contributed to this report from @entity248 .			0
