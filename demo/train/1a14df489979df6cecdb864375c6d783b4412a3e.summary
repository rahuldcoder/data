as a growing number of airplanes scoured the southern @entity3 in the search for @entity5 , authorities released new details that paint a different picture of what may have happened in the plane 's cockpit			1
military radar tracking shows that the aircraft changed altitude after making a sharp turn over the @entity15 as it headed toward the @entity16 , a source close to the investigation into the missing flight told @entity20			1
the plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar , according to the source			1
the sharp turn seemed to be intentional , the source said , because executing it would have taken the @entity26 777 two minutes -- a time period during which the pilot or co-pilot could have sent an emergency signal if there had been a fire or other emergency onboard			1
authorities say the plane did n't send any emergency signals , though some analysts say it 's still unclear whether the pilots tried but were n't able to communicate because of a catastrophic failure			1
the official , who is not authorized to speak to the media , told @entity20 that the area the plane flew in after the turn is a heavily trafficked air corridor and that flying at 12,000 feet would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic			1
earlier sunday , @entity50 authorities said the last transmission from the missing aircraft 's reporting system showed it heading to @entity54 -- a revelation that appears to undercut the theory that someone reprogrammed the plane 's flight path before the co-pilot signed off with air - traffic controllers for the last time			1
that reduces , but does n't rule out , suspicions about foul play in the cockpit			2
the new details give more insight about what happened on the plane , but do n't explain why the plane went missing or where it could be			1
analysts are divided about what the latest information could mean			2
some argue it 's a sign that mechanical failure sent the plane suddenly off course			2
others say there are still too many unknowns to eliminate any possibilities			0
@entity20 aviation analyst @entity83 called the fresh details about the flight a " game changer			0
" " now we have no evidence the crew did anything wrong , " he said			0
" and in fact , now , we should be operating with the primary assumption being that something bad happened to that plane shortly after they said good night			2
" if a crisis on board caused the plane to lose pressure , he said , pilots could have chosen to deliberately fly lower to save passengers onboard			2
" you want to get down to 10,000 feet , because that is when you do n't have to worry about pressurization			1
you have enough air in the atmosphere naturally to keep everybody alive , " he said			0
" so part of the procedure for a rapid decompression ... it 's called a high dive , and you go as quickly as you can down that to that altitude			0
" military radar tracked the flight between 1:19 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. the day it went missing , the source told @entity20 , but it 's not clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet			1
the new details about altitude are " highly significant , " said @entity125 , a @entity20 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity128 @entity127			1
" it explains so many pieces that did n't fit together before , " she said			1
" now , if we have a scenario where something happened , the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet , this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic onboard event , such as a rapid decompression , a fire , an explosion			1
that 's what you would have to do , descend , get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane			1
" if the latest information is accurate , the theory of pilots trying to save the plane fits , said @entity153 , a former @entity154 pilot and @entity20 aviation analyst			2
but that 's a big if , he said			0
" we 've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out , that i caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point , " he said			0
challenging search as speculation over what led to the flight 's disappearance showed no signs of slowing , investigators appeared to be beefing up their efforts to comb the southern @entity3			1
buoyed by a third set of satellite data that indicated possible debris from the plane in the water , the international team led by @entity172 fought bad weather as it looked for signs of the @entity26 and the 239 people who were aboard when the plane went missing on march 8			1
the search for the missing @entity185 plane resumed monday morning , with additional aircraft joining the operation , @entity172 authorities said			1
the @entity188 said 10 aircraft will search for possible objects in an area about 2,500 kilometers ( 1,550 miles ) southwest of @entity192			1
that includes two jets from @entity196 and two from @entity198 , which were on the way to join the search area on monday , authorities said			2
@entity202 's @entity201 said sunday that radar data from a satellite pointed to floating debris in the @entity3 2,300 kilometers ( 1,430 miles ) from @entity192 , @entity172			0
the data were immediately passed along to @entity50 authorities , and @entity202 satellite resources will home in more on the area , the ministry said			0
satellite images previously issued by @entity172 and @entity196 authorities have also captured possible large floating objects , stoking hopes searchers may find debris from the missing plane			1
but so far , searchers have turned up empty - handed after more than two weeks of scouring land and sea			0
on saturday , searchers found a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts , the @entity188 's @entity220 said			0
the use of wooden pallets is common in the airline industry			0
" it 's a possible lead ... but pallets are used in the shipping industry as well , " he said sunday			0
authorities have said random debris is often found in the ocean			0
the flying distance to and from the search area presents a big challenge for search aircraft			1
" they 're operating at the limits of their endurance , " said @entity237 , the authority 's rescue coordination chief			0
if search crews do turn up anything , they 'll soon have more technology to help them			2
the @entity250 is sending a super-sensitive hydrophone listening device to @entity172 to be on standby if debris from @entity5 is found and a search for the plane 's voice and data recorders can be done , a @entity128 military official said sunday			1
the device is pulled behind a ship at slow speeds and is used by the @entity250 to locate downed aircraft to a depth of 20,000 feet			1
nothing but water , and questions was turn reprogrammed ? @entity50 officials , in a written update sunday on the search , cast doubt on the theory that someone , perhaps a pilot , had reprogrammed the aircraft to make an unexpected left turn during the flight			1
" the last @entity276 transmission , sent at 1:07 a.m. , showed nothing unusual			0
the 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to @entity54 , " it read			0
the @entity282 and @entity283 measures thousands of data points and sends the information via satellite to the airline , the engine manufacturer and other authorized parties , according to @entity20 aviation and airline correspondent @entity290			2
had the plane been reprogrammed to change course , the @entity276 system should have reported it during its last communication at 1:07			0
the @entity276 is supposed to report new information every 30 minutes , but it was silent at 1:37			0
" it is important because it is more consistent ( with an emergency )			0
in other words , if the pilots had put in this waypoint that they were going to turn to and that they knew in advance of their last communication that they were going to turn , then everyone was ( saying ) that this had to be a premeditated act , " @entity125 said			1
" now if this information is correct , and it was not premeditated , then it does fit very closely with the scenario that , whatever happened , happened suddenly and they turned perhaps to go back to an emergency airport			2
" @entity313 , only hope @entity172 prime minister @entity315 voiced hope that investigators could be closing in on an answer to questions that have dogged authorities for days : what happened to the plane , and where is it ? " we have now had a number of very credible leads , and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope , no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill - fated aircraft , " @entity315 said at a news conference			2
in one of the great aviation mysteries in history , the airliner carrying 239 people disappeared march 8 after it took off from @entity341 , @entity50 , on a flight to @entity54			0
an exhaustive search covering 2.97 million square miles -- nearly the size of the continental @entity128 -- has yielded some clues but no evidence of where the @entity26 is or what happened to it			0
countries from central @entity351 to @entity172 are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane hours after it vanished			2
one arc tracks the southern @entity3 zone that 's the focus of current attention			0
the other arc tracks over parts of @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity196 and into @entity365			0
whole world listens for slowly fading pings @entity3 search has many challenges clues lead to new theories			0
