international monitors investigating the @entity2 crash in eastern @entity3 said friday the team was not given full access to the site and was greeted with hostility by armed men			1
" there did n't seem to be anyone really in control , " @entity9 , spokesman for the @entity11 team , told @entity13 's @entity12			2
armed men , apparently pro-russia militants , loosely guarded the area but could n't answer the monitors ' questions , he said			1
@entity9 said the group only stayed about 75 minutes and examined about 200 meters at the scene before being forced to leave			1
pieces of the airplane and bodies are spread over several kilometers			0
the @entity11 team arrived at the crash site near @entity28 in a remote section of eastern @entity3 that 's controlled by @entity31 militants battling the @entity3 government			1
the @entity33 says a surface - to - air missile , possibly fired by the militants , took down @entity36 17 on thursday as the plane traveled from @entity38 to @entity39 in @entity36			1
all 298 people on board died			2
@entity43 under secretary general @entity42 said 80 of the victims were children			1
lack of access to the crash site worries @entity33 officials , including @entity50 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications , who tweeted : " monitors should be able to access the crash site of @entity54			1
@entity33 is deeply concerned by reports that separatists are denying access			1
" @entity9 said the investigation will be difficult because the plane crashed in a difficult - to - access area in the countryside with no electricity			2
many of the victims were on vacation " i do n't think too much of the crime scene has been compromised already , " @entity9 said			1
" the bodies are still there			0
they have not been tampered with			0
we actually spoke to some civilian emergency workers			0
they said their job was just to mark where the bodies are			0
" the @entity76 is sending two investigators to work on the case , a @entity33 law enforcement official said , but the @entity3 government will be in charge of the investigation			1
@entity83 puts focus on @entity85 the location of the flight recorder has not been determined			1
ukrainian economy and trade minister @entity88 told @entity13 's @entity89 that @entity54 's black boxes are in @entity3			0
@entity88 would not say , though , whether the government has them			0
" they are on @entity3 territory			0
i do n't know whether we have it or the international team has it , " he said			2
earlier friday , the adviser to the exiled governor of @entity102 told @entity13 's @entity103 that the black boxes had been retrieved and were in rebel hands , though the location was not clear			0
@entity85 likely bears some of the responsibility for the apparent downing of @entity109 , president @entity83 said			1
in the administration 's strongest words yet on the downing of the jet , @entity83 said rebel fighters could n't have operated the surface - to - air missile believed responsible for the shootdown " without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training , and that is coming from @entity85			1
" in his remarks to reporters , @entity83 said that he did not want to get ahead of the facts of who may have been directly involved in the airliner 's destruction			1
but he said the @entity33 would work hard to hold accountable those responsible for it			1
he and other @entity33 officials stopped short of publicly placing the responsibility on @entity85 , which has denied involvement in the destruction of the jetliner			1
but a senior defense official told @entity13 that the " working theory " among @entity33 intelligence analysts is that the @entity85 military supplied the @entity136 missile system to rebel fighters inside @entity3			1
the @entity33 believes the missile system was transferred into eastern @entity3 from @entity85 " in recent days or weeks , " a senior administration official told @entity13 , and that the system was operational at the time			1
the @entity33 believes pro-russian separatists could not have operated it without @entity85 training , the official said , noting that it 's unknown whether @entity85 personnel were on scene when the plane was shot down			1
@entity33 officials believe the plane was " likely downed by a surface - to - air missile ... operated from a separatist - held location in eastern @entity3 , " the @entity33 ambassador to the @entity43 , @entity148 , told an emergency session of the @entity154			1
if @entity31 separatists are responsible for shooting down the plane with a missile , investigators ca n't rule out the possibility that @entity85 offered help to operate the system , she said			1
@entity148 also said @entity85 should take steps to cool tensions in @entity3			0
" @entity85 can end this war , " she said			0
" @entity85 must end this war			0
at least one @entity33 on board @entity83 confirmed that at least one @entity33 citizen was aboard the plane ; @entity169 was a student at @entity38 , according to his @entity171 page			1
a majority of the passengers ( at least 173 ) were @entity174			0
" no one can deny the truth that is revealed in the awful images that we all have seen , and the eyes of the world are on eastern @entity3 , and we are going to make sure that the truth is out , " @entity83 said			1
he called for an immediate cease - fire in the region and for a " credible international investigation " into what happened			0
@entity186 : what route did the flight take ? among the evidence cited by @entity33 officials and others for their conclusions was an audio recording released by @entity3 intelligence officials which purportedly feature @entity31 rebels and @entity85 military officers discussing a surface - to - air strike and the crash of a civilian jetliner			1
" how are things going there , " a man identified as a @entity85 intelligence agent asks			0
" well , we are 100 % sure that it was a civilian plane , " a man identified as a @entity31 fighter responds			2
" are there a lot of people ? " the @entity85 officer asks			0
the rebel fighter then utters an obscenity and says , " the debris was falling straight into the yards			0
" @entity13 can not confirm the authenticity of this audio , or other similar recordings			0
also , in a news conference friday , the chief of @entity3 's security service , @entity221 , said the @entity136 missile system that shot down the airliner crossed the border from @entity85 only " right before " the attack			1
he did n't say how investigators know that , however @entity3 's @entity230 news agency reported claims by an adviser to @entity3 minister of internal affairs @entity233 that the launcher , as well as the flight data recorders from @entity54 , were handed over to @entity85 agents across the border at a checkpoint in the @entity240 area overnight			2
a senior @entity3 official who spoke to @entity13 also accused @entity85 of carrying out a cover - up of its role in the shoot - down			2
he cited video showing a @entity136 launcher being moved toward @entity85 overnight			0
@entity13 could not independently confirm the claims			0
should downed @entity249 jet have flown over @entity3 ? @entity85 - @entity3 dispute tensions have been high between @entity3 and @entity85 since street protests forced former @entity254 president @entity253 from power in february			0
@entity85 subsequently annexed @entity3 's southeastern @entity257 region , and a @entity31 separatist rebellion has been raging in @entity3 's eastern @entity240 and @entity260 regions			0
@entity3 's government has accused @entity85 of allowing weapons and military equipment , including tanks , to cross the border illegally into the hands of @entity31 rebels			2
while @entity3 officials implicated pro-russian fighters and their @entity85 backers for the jetliner 's downing , @entity268 argued @entity3 was to blame			2
" with regard to the claims raised by @entity276 , that it was almost us who did it : in fact i have n't heard any truthful statements from @entity276 over the past few months , " @entity85 foreign minister @entity281 said in an exclusive interview with the state - run @entity85 24 tv channel			2
