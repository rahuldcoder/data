-- it was a gruesome act performed atop the stage of the global theater -- the grotesque image of a masked man , dressed all in black , beheading an @entity7 journalist in a production intended to strike terror into the hearts of millions around the world			2
this act of sadism was horrific enough on its own			0
but what some will also find deeply disturbing was that the jihadist executioner communicated his threat with a distinct @entity18 accent			1
the realization that there are people who grew up in @entity22 who are prepared to engage in such barbaric acts of depravity makes @entity26 's murder feel more intimate than if it was perpetrated by a foreign - sounding killer from a different society			1
propaganda films from @entity31 -- the @entity33 militant group that has seized large tracts of land in @entity36 and @entity37 in recent months -- regularly feature @entity22 recruits to demonstrate the group 's capacity to influence young @entity41 living in @entity42			1
earlier this week another threatening video from @entity31 featured a group of jihadists speaking with @entity22 accents as they interrogated a @entity48 hostage			1
some of them were n't even hiding their faces			0
the beheading of @entity26 was staged as a " message to @entity7 , " but it constituted a direct warning to @entity22			1
it served as a reminder that the killing of a young @entity59 soldier @entity58 on the streets of south @entity18 by two home - grown jihadists last year was not an isolated event			2
there has been a dramatic shift since september 11 , 2001 in the way that the risk of terrorism is perceived in @entity22 and @entity70 societies			2
@entity70 governments have been forced to confront an unexpected and deeply disturbing reality -- that it is sometimes the people already living in these societies who constitute the greatest security threat			0
the emergence of the " home grown terrorist " raises the fundamental question -- why do these radicalized jihadists reject the values and ways of life of the societies they inhabit ? thankfully only a small fraction of a minority of young radical @entity41 turn into hardened executioners of innocent victims			1
but a far greater number reject , even loathe , the cultural values of @entity22 society			1
many radical @entity41 are n't fervent @entity31 supports -- but some do regard the war to establish a global caliphate as a cause worth supporting			1
their response is integral to an uncomfortable reality that @entity22 society ignores at its peril			1
losing the battle of ideas since the terrorist bombings in @entity18 in july 2005 , the challenge of winning hearts and minds has been evident to policy makers			0
at the time , @entity22 prime minister @entity107 declared : " it 's important , however , that those engaged in terrorism realize that our determination to defend our values and our way of life is greater than their determination to cause death and destruction to innocent people in a desire to impose extremism on the world			2
" unfortunately very little progress has been made in upholding and explaining the values and way of life that are at stake -- and the shallowness of this statement was exposed a few years year later when the government 's plans to launch a @entity133 had to be quietly abandoned			0
the idea for organizing a @entity22 day was a direct response to the @entity18 bombings			2
at the time , chancellor @entity138 stated : " we have to face uncomfortable facts that while the @entity22 response to july 7th was remarkable , they were @entity22 citizens , @entity22 born apparently integrated into our communities , who were prepared to maim and kill fellow @entity22 citizens irrespective of their religion			0
" we have to be clearer now about how diverse cultures which inevitably contain differences can find the essential common purpose also without which no society can flourish			1
" sadly the government failed to give meaning to the idea of this " common purpose " and gave up on the idea			1
the very attempt to celebrate " @entity156 " only revealed an absence of clarity of what it was that ought to be valued and celebrated			0
the answer to the question of what it means to be @entity22 continues to elude policy makers			0
prime minister @entity167 has called for teaching @entity156 in school , in response to recent allegations about radical @entity172 influence in the classroom			0
but if political leaders find it difficult to explain what @entity156 represents , then how can teachers be expected to instruct their pupils ? unless @entity22 values actually mean something in public life they can not be taught			2
this is a challenge that has been evaded during the past decade			0
after the tragic murder of @entity26 , this challenge must no longer be avoided			0
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity31 releases video showing the beheading of journalist @entity26
@entity192 : the executioner in the video *appeared* to have a @entity18 accent
@entity192 : many radical @entity22 @entity41 reject , loathe cultural values of @entity22 society
@entity192 : @entity22 leaders failed to define common purpose that can unite all parts of society
