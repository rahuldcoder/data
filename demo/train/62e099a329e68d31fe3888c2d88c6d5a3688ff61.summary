the widow of @entity2 leader @entity1 said wednesday she wants his body exhumed to find out whether he was poisoned after tests showed high levels of a radioactive substance on some of his personal belongings			1
@entity9 told @entity10 she is requesting the body be exhumed " to make sure 100 % of the existence of polonium			2
" a @entity15 doctor said wednesday they found high levels of toxic polonium - 210 on some of @entity1 's belongings , though it does not mean he suffered radiation poisoning			1
" we have evidence there is too much polonium , but we also have hints from the medical records that this may not be the case , " said @entity21 , director of the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity15			1
" the only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body			0
" @entity9 said she had not made an official request to the @entity36 for exhumation because no official request is needed			2
the @entity36 said wednesday that it would not object to exhuming the body from its tomb if @entity1 's family approves			1
@entity1 belongings test high for radioactivity , scientist says if it turns out that @entity1 , who died in 2004 , was poisoned , " any result will be significant for us to help know the truth , " said @entity9 , the former leader 's widow			1
" it is a form of closure for our family			0
closing one wound but opening a new one , wondering who is responsible			0
" @entity21 's research team tested @entity1 's toothbrush , clothing and keffiyeh , the trademark black - and - white headscarf he often wore , @entity21 said			1
but getting data from items like clothing " is really tricky business , " said @entity59 , a professor and toxicologist at the @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity63			0
" we do n't have enough information to make any definitive statement , but it does seem a bit of a stretch " to conclude that @entity1 was poisoned by polonium - 210 , he told @entity10 in a telephone interview			1
@entity74 questioned how much confidence the @entity15 scientists could have in their measurements and said he was looking forward to results from tests carried out on the body after it is exhumed			0
" i 'd have a lot more confidence if you could give me a bone sample , " he told @entity10 in a telephone interview			0
he cited compartments inside the bone as particularly telling			0
" there 's old bone and then there 's new bone , " he said			0
" if you 're sampling , it would come out very differently			0
" @entity1 died at age 75 at a @entity97 military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma			1
@entity2 officials said in the days before his death that @entity1 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			2
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but @entity2 officials denied them , and then - foreign minister @entity108 said he " totally " ruled them out			0
two weeks after @entity1 's death , his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death			2
@entity114 , who was the @entity2 observer to the @entity115 , said toxicology tests showed " no known poison " -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle 's death			0
" the suspicion that he was killed , that he was deliberately murdered , has been there all along and most @entity2 believe that , " said @entity124 , a member of the @entity126 's executive committee			1
" i personally believed it because i was with him ; i saw him ; i saw the transformation and it certainly was unnatural			0
" @entity124 said she had spoken with @entity1 's doctors , who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned			1
" but we did n't have any kind of thread , any kind of evidence , " she told @entity10			0
" this report , in many ways , tells us our suspicions are founded that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed , that he was assassinated using polonium			1
" only a few countries , including the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , have stocks of polonium - 210 , a fact that would limit the list of possible suspects , he said			1
" you would only use polonium if you were making a statement , not if you were trying to hide , " he said			0
someone trying to get away with murder would be better off using pharmaceutical agents , since a number of of them " disappear in the body " and can not be identified later , he said			0
" i ca n't figure out why they would use it , frankly , " he said			0
" there are so many really cool agents to kill people if you want to be secret and even if you want to make a statement			0
" @entity36 president @entity169 has ordered a committee investigating @entity1 's death to follow up on all reports " and to seek assistance from @entity175 and international experts to find the truth behind @entity1 's illness and death , " said his spokesman , @entity179			2
it should be possible to detect any remaining polonium -- a naturally radioactive chemical element -- in @entity1 's body , despite the time that has elapsed since his death because he was buried in a tomb , not underground , @entity21 said			1
@entity1 's widow asked the @entity15 institute to analyze some of his belongings and medical documents , @entity21 said			2
the @entity192 - based satellite network @entity191 relayed the request and broadcast a report about the test results			1
the testing found no evidence of traditional poison , @entity21 said			2
but @entity191 and the family then asked him to test for radioactive material , and found an " unexplained amount of polonium - 210 , " he said , adding , " we are testing tiny quantities so it is difficult to measure and not conclusive			1
" a body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope , while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter , @entity21 said			1
a becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity			0
the fabric of @entity1 's clothing , without body fluid , contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter , @entity21 said			1
tests involving biological samples -- such as urine , sweat or blood -- contained higher levels than other samples taken from his clothing , he said			1
@entity1 's widow had left his clothes inside a sports bag from the time they were returned to her eight years ago from the hospital , @entity21 said			2
it was not clear whether anything that may have happened to the clothes -- over the years or in the testing process -- may have affected the test results			1
asked whether polonium - 210 could have been applied to the items since @entity1 's death , @entity21 said , " anything is possible			1
" @entity21 also said the @entity22 did not verify that the clothing was @entity1 's ; another organization concluded that the dna on the items was similar to that of @entity1 's daughter			2
@entity9 provided her dna for the comparison , @entity9 told @entity10			0
the wait for test results , which lasted months , " was emotionally difficult , " she said			1
former @entity149 spy @entity248 died of polonium poisoning in @entity250 in 2006			0
but it 's hard to compare the cases of @entity1 and @entity248 , who was diagnosed when he was alive , @entity21 said			2
@entity1 's symptoms when he died were not entirely consistent with polonium poisoning , he said			1
" for example , the bone marrow stayed in good shape until ( the ) death of @entity1			2
in other cases of polonium poisoning there is a decaying of the bone marrow , " the medical expert said			0
" another point , he did not lose his hair as would be expected in the case of polonium			0
scientists performed more than 50 measurements on the belongings between february and june , he said .			0

a stain contained higher levels of polonium - 210 than a typical sample , a scientist says
the test results do not *necessarily* mean @entity1 was poisoned , the scientist says
" there is sufficient evidence " @entity1 was killed , @entity126 official says
use of polonium - 210 as a poison " does seem a bit of a stretch , " toxicologist says
