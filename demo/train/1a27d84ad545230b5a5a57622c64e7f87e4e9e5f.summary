consider that just in the past few days , a @entity2 official revealed that in march a @entity4 passenger jet nearly collided with a small - unmanned aircraft that looked similar to an @entity7 jet and was flying above 2,000 feet over @entity8			2
these details and the fact that the drone was described as " camouflaged " suggest that it was not a civilian drone			2
then sunday the @entity14 announced that they had engineered a copy of a highly sophisticated @entity17 surveillance drone that they had captured in 2011			2
@entity14 's state television showed footage of what they claimed was a replica of the @entity17 @entity23 drone			0
a photograph showed @entity14 's @entity25 , ayatollah @entity26 , sitting next to the drone			0
the same day that the @entity14 showed off their new drone , sen. @entity29 , @entity30 , wrote an op - ed in the @entity32 arguing against the appointment of @entity34 as a federal judge			0
@entity34 was a @entity36 lawyer who was involved in drafting the legal opinions used to justify the 2011 drone strike in @entity39 that killed @entity40 , an @entity17 citizen who had taken a leadership role in @entity42			1
@entity29 wrote , " killing an @entity17 citizen without a trial is an extraordinary concept and deserves serious debate			1
i ca n't imagine appointing someone to the federal bench , one level below the @entity50 , without fully understanding that person 's views concerning the extrajudicial killing of @entity17 citizens			0
... i believe that all senators should have access to all of these opinions			0
furthermore , the @entity17 people deserve to see redacted versions of these memos so that they can understand the @entity63 administration 's legal justification for this extraordinary exercise of executive power			1
" not so long ago , killing an @entity17 citizen on the other side of the world with an armed drone would have been in the realm of science fiction			1
before 9/11 , the @entity17 had only a handful of experimental drones that had never been used to kill anyone			1
today , there are at least 7,000 drones in the @entity17 arsenal , more than 200 of which are armed drones that have killed thousands of people			1
nine facts about armed drones this large @entity17 fleet of drones is a harbinger of an important trend			1
armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during @entity89 we can expect to see them used not only by the @entity17 , but also by other countries such as @entity93 and @entity94 that are jumping into the production of armed drones			1
but armed drones raise a number of moral and political issues that are unresolved			1
in @entity100 , the @entity99 drone campaign is deeply unpopular because @entity100 ask themselves : what gives the @entity17 the right to invade the sovereign airspace of our nation and sometimes kill our civilians , even in the service of the laudable goal of killing @entity42 militants ? for @entity17 readers , do a thought experiment in which armed @entity113 drones were routinely killing members of drug cartels living in @entity116 , but they were also sometimes killing a number of ordinary @entity118 and you get a sense of how the average @entity100 thinks about this issue			1
in @entity39 , the @entity17 drone campaign has also become increasingly controversial because drones continue to kill @entity39 civilians -- as they did last month in a strike that targeted members of @entity42 's @entity39 affiliate			1
in that strike on april 19 , at least nine militants were killed but so were three civilians			1
even with these issues , drones present features that make them appealing to political and military leaders			1
drones are not simply pieces of artillery that happen to fly			1
they have four characteristics that mean they are likely to reshape warfare at a tactical level			1
first , armed drones are different from any previous form of artillery because they can linger over and assess a target for many hours			1
that capability can quite dramatically lower the civilian casualty rates that have been typical of earlier eras of warfare			1
the smallest bomb dropped by the @entity152 is typically 500 pounds			0
such a bomb can not , of course , distinguish between a civilian and a combatant			0
a drone can do so			0
and it can also shoot much smaller missiles , such as the 100 - pound hellfire missile			0
in that sense there is a case to be made that armed drones presage a more ethical form of warfare that kills fewer civilians			1
but that does n't mean of course that drones and the people who operate them wo n't kill civilians in the future			1
the @entity17 drone campaigns in @entity100 and @entity39 have killed hundreds of civilians over the past half decade			1
second , armed drones also make it possible to wage war against particular individuals			1
in a sense drones are flying assassins that target particular people			1
it is not an accident that the rise of drone warfare has coincided with @entity17 's unconventional war against @entity42 and its allies			2
in conventional wars , armies wearing uniforms attack each other			0
but in the kind of drone warfare that the @entity17 has conducted since 9/11 outside of conventional war zones in countries such as @entity100 and @entity39 , drone strikes are not directed at someone because of his status as a uniformed member of another military force , but rather because of the individual 's suspected connection to @entity42 or an allied group			1
@entity203 : target an @entity17 with drones ? third , there is a lower threshold for the use of force when armed drones are an option			1
in many ways the use of armed drones is akin to the use of cyberwarfare			1
both tactics greatly reduce or eliminate the number of deaths that would result from a conventional armed conflict			2
and whoever launches a drone attack or a cyberattack pays no costs of the kind that would typically take place on a conventional battlefield			0
you ca n't shoot down a drone pilot or kill a computer technician launching some kind of cyberattack thousands of miles from the intended target			2
for this reason , drones and cyber capabilities can make conflict more likely as the barriers to engage in either drone warfare or cyberconflict are so low			1
( until , of course , the opponent has the resources to retaliate in kind			0
) fourth , drone warfare is taking place in an unprecedented information environment in which the @entity17 government collects ever - vaster amounts of data			2
this data collection is so extensive that the @entity250 , for instance , can record every phone call that is made in a particular country			0
it is this merger of " big data " and drone technology , which is also complemented by human intelligence about suspected terrorists provided by @entity99 assets on the ground in places such as @entity100 's tribal regions , that has made drone warfare against @entity42 and its allies so effective			2
the @entity99 drone campaign in @entity100 has killed 58 militant leaders , according to a count by the @entity266			0
thirty - five militant leaders have also been killed in @entity39			0
meanwhile , at least 339 civilians have been killed as well as at least 2,200 foot soldiers in militant groups in @entity100 and @entity39			2
at least 230 other people were reported killed , though it was not clear from reliable news accounts if they were militants or civilians			2
indeed , using the most conservative estimates from a database of drone attacks maintained by the @entity266 , the @entity63 administration authorized the killing of more than 2,400 people in drone strikes in @entity100 and @entity39 from the time it first assumed office until the end of march 2014			0
( using the least conservative estimates from that database , the total number of people killed was almost 4,000			0
) put another way , using the most conservative estimates of the numbers of people killed in drone strikes by the @entity63 administration , they amount to three times the total number of the some 800 prisoners at the @entity298 prison camp placed there by the @entity300 administration			0
as president @entity63 reportedly told some of his aides , " turns out i 'm really good at killing people			0
did n't know that was going to be a strong suit of mine			0
" @entity308 recognized the devastation that such drone strikes were inflicting on his organization , writing a lengthy memo about the issue that was later recovered in the compound in @entity100 where he was killed three years ago			0
in the october 2010 memo to a lieutenant , @entity308 advised his men to leave the @entity100 tribal regions where the drone strikes have been overwhelmingly concentrated			0
@entity308 wrote , " i am leaning toward getting most of our brothers out of the area " and urged his followers to depart for the remote @entity323 province of @entity324 , explaining that " due to its rough terrain and many mountains , rivers , trees , it can accommodate hundreds of the brothers without them being spotted by the enemy			0
" the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been dropping dramatically in recent years			0
according to @entity266 data , the casualty rate in @entity100 for civilians and also for " unknowns " -- those who were not identified in news reports definitively as either militants or civilians -- was around 40 % under president @entity300 when the drone program was in its infancy			2
it has come down to about 7 % under @entity63			0
@entity203 : @entity63 's high - stakes drone war in @entity39 in 2013 in @entity100 and @entity39 , the numbers of civilians killed by drones in both countries combined was the lowest ever , in the single digits , according to the @entity266 's data			1
this shift has been accomplished because of the combined effects of smaller munitions , improved drone flight technology , better intelligence on the ground , stricter @entity36 guidelines regarding the use of drones , increased congressional oversight of the drone program and greater public scrutiny of the issue			2
it will be many years before other countries are able to build up the capacity that the @entity17 has to carry out lethal drone strikes			0
as of 2013 , the @entity17 had drone bases in countries such as @entity323 , @entity373 and @entity374			0
and it is n't as easy as some might think for other nations to arm unarmed drones			2
such weapons systems require specific electrical engineering ; the wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile ; the drone must be equipped with fire control systems , and built - in mounting brackets are needed to attach munitions to the vehicle			0
but even with these inherent limitations , the drone industry thrives , and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the drone bandwagon			0
and the @entity17 aggressive and secretive drone campaign against @entity42 and its affiliates is setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed drones			1
it is these kinds of drone strikes that are controversial since the use of armed drones in a conventional war is not much different , legally , than a manned aircraft that drops bombs or fires missiles			1
there has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such drone attacks should be among policymakers at the international level			2
it 's long past due for that conversation to happen .			0

@entity419 says use of drones for military purposes is going to *proliferate*
drones enable warfare to be fought at lower cost without *risking* pilots ' lives
they offer more precise targeting but still will kill civilians and thus will stir debate
@entity203 : @entity436 and legal *questions* raised by the use of armed drones abound
