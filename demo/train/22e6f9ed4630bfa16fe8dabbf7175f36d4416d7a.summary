-- president - elect @entity1 is poised to restore the @entity3 ' image in the international community , but experts say the president - elect must show the world that his actions will live up to his rhetoric			1
people in @entity11 , @entity12 , celebrate the election of @entity1			2
receiving a warm welcome is not the same as maintaining one , and @entity1 has a lot of work to do to improve the @entity3 brand			2
@entity3 's image has declined in nearly every region of the world in recent years , but @entity1 's victory " enables the @entity3 to start again with a clean slate , " according to @entity24 , the senior associate dean at @entity25			1
" @entity3 can actually go to dinner parties and cocktail receptions around the world today and not have to apologize for the @entity3 the way they have had to do the last several years , " he said			2
" the election has made life a little bit easier for @entity3 living and traveling abroad to hold their head up high again			2
" the @entity3 ' tarnished reputation has been fueled by a combination of factors , including opposition to @entity3 policies like the war @entity39 and alleged torture and abuse of prisoners , the perception of hypocrisy , unilateralism , and the perceived war on @entity47 , according to a congressional report released in june			0
@entity1 represents a " clean break " from the past , and his election is the first big step toward change , said @entity53 , author of " @entity54			1
" " @entity56 's standing in the world was going to be the work of a generation , and it would have to start with some kind of grand gesture that demonstrated that things were changing			0
his election in itself is that kind of grand gesture , " he said			0
throughout the election season , @entity1 was largely well received across the globe			0
more than 200,000 people came to watch his speech in @entity70 , @entity71 , in july , according to police estimates -- and it was n't because they 'd read his book or memorized his policies			0
" it was because they all felt that he was the incarnation of change and they admired him			0
they had an emotional connection , " @entity53 said			0
when @entity3 voted for @entity1 on november 4 , citizens around the world celebrated his resounding win			1
people in cities and villages danced and cheered in the streets , and @entity12 declared the day after the election a national holiday			0
in @entity92 -- where the media is state - run and domestic stories are almost always the top stories -- newspaper headlines read " @entity96			0
" when president @entity100 was elected for his second term , the cover on the @entity99 's @entity98 read , " how can 59,054,087 people be so dumb ? " the day after @entity1 's victory , the paper 's cover read , " @entity106 ! " while the reaction around the world was mostly positive , some areas have been more hesitant to embrace @entity1			2
the day after the election , @entity110 published an article titled , " pakistanis skeptical about @entity1			0
" in the months before the election , a survey by the @entity115 suggested little enthusiasm for @entity1 or sen. @entity118 in the @entity119 , especially in @entity121 nations			0
but in general , people across the world have reacted with joy to @entity1 's election because they are looking forward to the end of the unpopular presidency of @entity100 , said @entity128 , @entity0 's @entity129 political editor based in @entity130			1
" the arrival of @entity1 , as an @entity132 - @entity3 president , gives people a reason -- an excuse even -- to start loving @entity3 again , " @entity128 said			1
but with expectations so high , experts say @entity1 will have to work to capitalize on the opportunity before him			0
" @entity1 needs to show that he is prepared to listen to @entity3 's allies , to consult with them genuinely on issues like @entity143 and climate change , to open up to new thinking about @entity146 and @entity147 , to re-shape the world 's economic institutions , " @entity128 said			1
the biggest thing @entity1 could do to reshape @entity3 foreign policy would be to capture @entity152 , @entity24 said			1
" for eight years he dodged @entity100 and i think president - elect [ @entity1 ] has been pretty strong in terms of indicating his determination to secure @entity152 , " he said			1
if that were to occur , @entity24 said , " the @entity3 could then in a sense close that chapter in its history and perhaps reopen dialogue with many parts of the @entity163 world that the relentless pursuit of @entity165 and the @entity39 war have closed off in the last few years			1
" @entity1 must also bring a greater level of professionalism to the selection of the ambassadors he appoints , @entity24 said			2
" i think previous administrations have not served @entity3 overseas interests and image that well by in some cases appointing cronies who have n't even set foot in the country to which they were appointed before they were named as ambassadors , " he said			0
@entity53 said that most importantly , @entity1 must listen to what the international community wants if he wants to restore @entity3 's reputation			1
" the number one thing the people hold against us is that we do n't appear to take their interests into account , " he said			0
closing @entity192 , adhering to the @entity190 and eliminating torture are key issues for people around the world because they are the symbols of @entity3 unilateralism , @entity53 said			1
@entity53 also suggested that @entity1 take a page out of president @entity200 's playbook and give the rest of the world an opportunity to experience @entity3 culture through an agency like the now - defunct @entity205			1
in addition to exposing the rest of the world to @entity3 culture , @entity1 should also make sure young @entity3 are citizens of the world			1
@entity53 recommends education reform , with an emphasis on world history and language classes			0
" they think we are clueless , they absolutely think we are clueless , and in many cases we are , " pointing to a 2002 @entity217 study indicating that nearly a third of young @entity3 could not locate the @entity219			0
@entity220 , @entity0 's @entity221 bureau chief , said that if the president - elect wants to change the world 's view of the @entity3 , " @entity1 has to be @entity1			1
" " @entity1 's support in @entity129 is pretty much based on the fact that most people on this side of the @entity229 are fed up with the @entity100 administration , not with @entity3 as a nation , " he said .			2

people around the world celebrated the election of @entity1
the @entity3 ' reputation has been on the decline in recent years
@entity1 must address issues like @entity192 , @entity190 , @entity53 says
capturing @entity152 would reshape @entity3 foreign policy , @entity24 says
