-- @entity1 will have plenty of time to ponder his tendency to bite opposition players after the @entity7 striker was banned for nine international matches and suspended for four months from any football activity by @entity10			1
the @entity12 striker , who has bitten players three times in his career - the latest incident coming in a key @entity18 game -- is also set to miss a large chunk of the @entity21 premier season as he is " banned from any football related activity " by football 's world governing body			2
the punishment is the most severe ever handed out at a @entity18 for an offense committed on the field of play but the striker does have the right to appeal and is allowed to transfer clubs during the four month period			2
@entity10 had begun proceedings wednesday after the striker was accused of biting another player during his team 's @entity18 victory over @entity39 a day earlier and announced its verdict at a news conference thursday			1
" the first match of this suspension is to be served in the upcoming @entity18 fixture between @entity50 and @entity51 on 28 june 2014 , " said @entity10 's statement , referring to the last - 16 game between the @entity45 teams in @entity46 saturday			1
" the remaining match suspensions shall be served in @entity51 's next @entity18 match ( es ) , as long as the team qualifies , and / or in the representative team 's subsequent official matches			2
" @entity1 is also " prohibited from entering the confines of any stadium " during his ban and must pay a fine of 100,000 @entity62 -- $ 111,000			2
" such behavior can not be tolerated on any football pitch , and in particular not at a @entity18 when the eyes of millions of people are on the stars on the field , " said @entity10 disciplinary committee chairman @entity63			0
" the disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of mr @entity1 's guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code			0
the decision comes into force as soon it is communicated			0
" according to @entity10 's disciplinary code , the forward could have faced a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years			1
former @entity86 international @entity85 was given an eight - match ban in 1994 , the longest suspension in @entity18 history , after breaking the nose of @entity92 's @entity91			1
the ban for @entity12 striker , who has been repeatedly linked with a move away from the @entity98 club , leaves his club in the lurch as they plan for a return to @entity103 's top tier competition -- the @entity104 -- next season			0
" @entity12 will wait until we have seen and had time to review the @entity113 report before making any further comment , " said the club 's chief executive @entity106 in a statement on their website			0
already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent , @entity1 was at it again in his country 's key @entity18 victory over @entity39 earlier this week			1
just before @entity51 's winning goal , the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with @entity39 defender @entity123 with both men falling to the floor			1
television pictures showed @entity1 dipping his head towards @entity123 , and when the @entity86 defender eventually got up , he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder			1
the @entity7 was banned for 10 games in april 2013 after being found guilty of biting @entity133 defender @entity132			1
he was also guilty of biting during his time in the @entity135 with @entity136 where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of @entity140			1
it 's not just biting that features on @entity1 's rap sheet			1
at the @entity144 in @entity145 , he deliberately handled the ball on the goal - line to deny @entity148 a place in the semifinals of the @entity18			0
he was sent off for his troubles but @entity148 missed the penalty and @entity51 went on to finish fourth in the tournament			0
the following year after his move to @entity12 , @entity1 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity156 's @entity155			2
he was fined $ 63,000 and banned for eight matches			0
ahead of the @entity18 , @entity1 had undergone knee surgery , missing @entity51 's first @entity18 game , before returning to face @entity160 , when he scored twice in the @entity45 team 's 2 - 1 win			1
" before the game people in @entity160 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , " @entity1 told reporters following the game			0
" i want to see what they think now			0
i have dreamed of this moment			0
" @entity1 enjoyed a sensational season with @entity12 -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the @entity104			2
he was voted @entity173 by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists ' @entity173 too -- awards that reflected a feeling that @entity1 had put behind him his troubled past			0
but he now looks set to miss @entity12 's first nine @entity98 games of the season and the start of the club 's @entity104 campaign .			0
