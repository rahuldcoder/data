-- voter turnout was terrible last tuesday			1
as president @entity4 lamented in his post-election press conference wednesday , two - thirds of voters chose not to vote , making it perhaps the lowest midterm turnout since the 1940s			1
conventional wisdom says low turnout favors republicans , and it did last week			1
but the days when one party sees low turnout as being in its own interest might be drawing to a close -- and it may be republicans who will drive the change			0
midterm electorates are typically smaller , whiter and older than presidential electorates			0
in recent years , the @entity15 has worked hard to ensure that its shrinking , white , aging base turns out in disproportionately large numbers			2
and even though there are plenty of @entity15 leaders who 'd like to see their party become younger and more diverse , the practical pressures of here - and - now politics have led them to go into campaigns with the voters they have , not the ones they wished they had			1
but on tuesday , the wishes of those republicans hoping to expand the base started coming true -- at least on the margins , and enough to suggest a new way forward			0
while @entity15 extended their dominance among older white voters , they also made modest inroads with @entity44 and @entity47 - @entity46 voters , partly by downplaying the nativist messages of past cycles and partly by exploiting frustration with the @entity4 administration			1
several new - generation black , @entity44 and @entity47 @entity15 candidates were also elected across the country			1
meanwhile , @entity15 leaders such as sen. @entity55 have been engaging millennial voters on campuses and elsewhere with an unapologetic libertarianism that resonates with some young people			1
as a result , it 's possible for a smart @entity15 to see 2014 not only as a win , but as a hint of how the party could prevail in 2016 as well			2
to put it simply , the @entity15 might soon see it as in its own interest to boost turnout among young voters and voters of color , instead of writing them off or , as still happens too often , blocking them from voting at all			1
this would be a major departure , to be sure			0
we 're still a long way from a heartfelt and well - executed effort to expand the @entity15 demographic base			1
and even if party leaders want it , there are still too many voters who vote @entity15 precisely because they fear or blame the very people the leaders want to bring into the tent			1
still , it 's at least becoming possible now			0
there is an opening among @entity44 , @entity47 and young voters			1
and it would be fantastic for the country if @entity15 pushed to exploit that opening			2
that may sound funny coming from a @entity91			0
my party in the 21st century has become the default choice for voters shorthanded as the " rising @entity46 electorate , " which is to say , young and nonwhite voters			1
i recognize that an effort by the @entity15 to grab a chunk of that electorate would be a challenge to my party			2
as an @entity46 though , i 'd love to see it happen			2
i 'd love to see young and nonwhite voters tell candidates from both parties that they are not to be taken for granted , and i 'd love for each party to try to outdo the other not just in raising money but in raising turnout across the board			1
it would be great for the country if both parties in earnest developed new policy ideas that address the hopes and dreams of millennial voters and voters of color			2
this means not simply trying to win by carving off slightly more than half of those voters that do turn out , but trying to build true majorities of all the voters			0
weeks before the midterm elections , @entity129 released a video that went instantly viral called " turn out for what ? " with rap stars and other celebrities , it drove home the message that there were numerous issues , from same - sex marriage to marijuana to student debt , that should drive young people to turn out and vote			2
in the end , of course , only a fraction of them did			0
" turn out for what ? " can be also read as a cynical statement			0
as in , " why bother ? " if we 're ever going to change the " why bother " attitude , it 's going to be because both parties are actively fighting for voters not just in their currently defined bases , but in every subgroup			0
so i hope , for my country , that the party i do n't belong to starts investing heavily in appealing to people who do n't belong to it either			0
and i hope , for my country , that members of this rising @entity46 electorate start demanding more from both parties before giving away their votes , either by casting predictable ballots or not casting them at all			1
i loved the @entity129 campaign			0
but true progress will come when we wo n't need chiding , even fun chiding , to get out and participate , when both parties will be outracing each other to bring more people into the voting booth because they 'll have nothing to fear from elections that are truly representative			0
let 's turn out for that .			0
