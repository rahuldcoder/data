-- i 'm sitting alone in my apartment on a rainy night			1
i 'm restless , mildly bored , and , yes , i 'll admit it , but please do n't tell anyone ... lonely			1
it 's days like this that i 'm sure that there 's no more love in store for me -- all of the epically momentous possibilities must have already passed me by			1
somehow i blinked and missed them			1
it 's in moments like this that i allow myself the small indulgence of thinking about @entity17			1
our story had all of the makings of a great love story			1
once upon a time we met one evening in a dark , crowded party			1
he told me i was beautiful			2
i was young enough for him to appear larger than life			2
we kissed on the sidewalk in the rain			2
i fell hard for him -- hard like scrape - me - off - the - floor - with - a - spatula hard			2
but we were wrong for each other in every way			2
we were young , immature , and troubled			2
it ended tragically -- @entity17 stood me up on a cold , snowy @entity34 and the two of us never spoke again			2
i went on with my life			2
i wonder what @entity17 is doing right now			2
i wonder if i will ever love anyone that way again -- with an open heart			1
i decide to cruise the internet for inspiration -- narrowly avoiding the temptation to do a @entity45 search of @entity17 's name			1
the intention of my search ? to remind myself that love really exists			1
a tall , existential order for sure , yet a valid one			2
on the street , on the subway			0
every time i encounter a seemingly happy couple i say to myself , " see you bitter old hag , people fall in love all the time			1
" i find the kind of cinematic headline i 'm looking for : " @entity62 19 years later			0
as a teenager , @entity63 decided to reach out to the troops during the @entity66			0
she addressed a letter of support and encouragement to " any soldier			1
" @entity63 's anonymous letter found its way into the hands of 19 - year - old soldier @entity74			1
@entity63 and @entity74 continued to write each other for the duration of the war , to exchange stories and keep their minds off of the scary worlds around them			0
after the war ended , the two lost touch			0
@entity63 wrapped up her letters in a patriotic ribbon , put them away in a safe place , and moved on with her life			0
the @entity0 : i was the other woman -- should i tell ? nineteen years later , @entity63 got curious one day ( maybe she was sitting alone in her apartment on a rainy evening ? ) and looked for @entity74 on @entity90 and sent a simple message to a man with his name , asking , " were you in @entity66 ? " that was all @entity74 needed in order to know that he had to see @entity63 again			1
the two met up in person a few months later			0
when @entity74 finally saw @entity63 he says of the moment , " it took my breath , i was actually shaking and i 'm a pretty strong man			0
i just said to myself , ' you have to do whatever you can to make sure you spend the rest of your life with this woman			0
' " a few months later they were married			0
the @entity0 : how to handle an overly dependent bff wow			0
just like that huh ? @entity66			0
i 'm sure someone in @entity116 will be calling any minute to option the rights to the film			0
maybe they 'll call it " love in a @entity122 of @entity123			1
" i should feel inspired that love happens -- exponentially and effortlessly -- yet i feel nothing but skepticism			1
does this actually happen in real life ? like , real real life ? the @entity0 : need to say goodbye to single life before i can find love ? like @entity63 and @entity74 , @entity17 and i lost touch after that fateful @entity34			1
when he sent me a message on @entity90 10 years later , i was unable to breathe			1
it said simply , " i hope you 're still silly			0
" when we met in person for coffee , i was so dizzy that i had to sit with my head between my legs while he sat silently across from me			0
his hand shook slightly as he grabbed mine and said , " i 'm sorry , i 've been waiting 10 years to say that to you			0
" momentarily i was so giddy that i almost let myself get carried away			0
i looked at @entity17 for the first time in the bright , clear morning light and saw him exactly as he was			0
it happened so quickly that if i had blinked i would have missed it			0
he was just an older , more mature , version of the awful of the guy who broke my heart 10 years ago			1
just an awkward meeting of two grownups realizing that they were no longer young and silly			0

late on rainy , lonely nights , some people are tempted to @entity45 an old love
one story about a soldier and teen had a happy @entity90 ending
inspired writer searches for and meets up with her old love
but finds he 's older , more mature , version of the awful of the guy who broke her heart
