-- rising from the desert like a white @entity4 castle , @entity1 has all the trimmings you 'd expect of a six - star luxury hotel			1
walk through the grand marble entrance , replete with chandelier , and you 'll find a fitness studio , swimming pool , solarium and international restaurant			1
but behind the gold - plated doors , a team of fitness gurus from across the world is catering to an unlikely guest			1
welcome to @entity21 's @entity20 , the breeding ground of some of the most successful -- and expensive -- race horses on the planet			1
owned by the @entity28 state 's former prime minister @entity26 , the 580 - acre estate is home to about 60 champion horses -- either in training for their next million - dollar competition or being used to breed a new generation of winners			1
one of those champions , @entity4 stallion @entity37 , this week won @entity21 's most prestigious race , the @entity40 , extending his unbeaten winning streak to a remarkable six			1
his silver sword trophy -- not to mention $ 550,000 in prize money -- will now join the many others already lining @entity1 's lavish lobby			2
behind @entity37 's success -- and that of his predecessor @entity48 , who won the sword in 2009 and 2010 -- is an international team of trainers , nutritionists and scientists reinventing the way that champion stallions are raised			1
" i do n't think you could find facilities like that in @entity65 , " says @entity1 's head trainer , @entity57 , pointing to the farm 's swimming pool , treadmill and solarium			1
with temperatures in @entity21 soaring to @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , the pool is an ideal place for sleek stallions to cool down after a morning workout			1
the water itself is kept at a comfortable @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , in an air - conditioned room			2
" the horses go in for one or two minutes , " @entity78 says			2
" you have good and bad swimmers , but we never push them if they do n't want to go			0
and 95 % of them really love swimming			0
" the extreme desert weather means temperatures can also drop to @entity87 ( @entity88 ) in winter			0
but instead of shivering in the paddocks , the pampered ponies are treated to a solarium session			0
" we use the solarium after swimming			0
sometimes the weather can drop to @entity88 ( @entity94 ) in the morning , so we use it to dry the horses , " @entity78 explains			0
" some of them have back problems and , because the lights are around @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , it 's good for them			0
" when not relaxing in front of the solarium , the horses -- a mixture of @entity4 stallions and thoroughbreds -- can enjoy a nutritious meal of hay imported from @entity112 and fresh alfalfa grown in the garden			2
when @entity112 @entity78 first arrived at @entity1 ( " @entity116 " ) seven years ago , he was astonished to find a thriving farm housing not just horses , but cows and gazelles			2
but it can be hard work creating a green oasis in the desert , with track specialists importing grass seeds from the @entity127 during the winter and turf from @entity130 during the summer			0
" the main challenge here is actually growing the grass			0
we do n't have rain , the climatic conditions are very harsh , and there is a lot of salt in the water so we always have high ph levels , " says @entity134 and @entity136 track manager @entity135			0
" we also have a lot of funguses and diseases -- our track could be in perfect condition one day and the next morning all of a sudden it 's brown			0
" it may seem like an exhausting amount of resources plowed into keeping horses happy			0
but this is @entity21 , an oil - rich emirate which has invested heavily in its racing industry -- and its brand abroad -- in the last decade			1
in 2008 , the @entity134 and @entity136 became the official sponsor of @entity112 's prestigious @entity159 -- the richest turf race in @entity65 , which attracts a tv audience of around 1 billion			2
last year the @entity21 royal family 's private investment company , @entity162 , also bought the naming rights for the @entity165 , which includes premier races the @entity167 , the @entity168 , the @entity169 , in a multimillion - pound deal			1
" we are trying our best to be one of the top horse racing industries in the world , we 're trying our best to be an icon , " said @entity173 bin @entity171 , son of the emir of @entity21			1
" we 're not looking to be the greatest -- we 've got our own style and we 've our own guidelines to work with			0
but hopefully we 'd like to be one of the main race tracks in the world			0
" if the horses are anything to go by , a day out at the races in @entity21 is sure to be a luxurious experience .			1
