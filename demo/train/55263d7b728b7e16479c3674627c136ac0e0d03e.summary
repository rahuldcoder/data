-- when @entity2 published the first trailer of @entity5 's new series " @entity6 " in november on its website , readers were abuzz with excitement			1
according to the synopsis , the show revolves around two quarreling @entity12 homicide detectives , played by @entity13 and @entity14 , who are ordered to go to couples therapy			0
while many were keen to see " @entity18 " star @entity14 again , it appeared that most commenters were sure they would like " @entity6 " because they knew what to expect			2
" another light - hearted show that is perfect on @entity5 , " one user , @entity22 , said			1
" i 'll always give a @entity5 show a chance and rarely have i been disappointed , " another user named @entity26 said			2
now , six months later , " @entity6 " is set to kick off the network 's 2012 summer line - up that includes returning shows " @entity31 , " " @entity32 , " " suits , " " @entity34 , " " @entity35 " and " @entity36			1
" the buddy - cop show , which will premiere at 10 p.m. et friday , will form a crucial part of @entity5 's annual and popular summer block			1
the network even claimed that it " owns summer " in a recent news release			0
according to ratings tracker @entity42 , @entity5 averaged 3.61 million viewers in primetime from may 30 to august 21 last year			2
the newspaper @entity46 also reported in january that @entity5 had an average of 3.2 million total viewers and remained the top - rated cable network for the sixth consecutive year in 2011			1
over the years , this success has largely been attributed to @entity5 's original series , which are often character - driven comedy - dramas that are fun and set in bright and beautiful locations , which have become almost synonymous with destination summer viewing			1
the ' characters welcome ' branding @entity57 , executive producer of " @entity6 , " told @entity0 that the show was originally written to air on @entity59 , but was picked up by @entity5 because the focus on the detectives ' relationship and therapy sessions seemed to be a better fit for them			1
" @entity5 does work differently , they push characters over plot , " he said			2
" they were really interested in well - developed and fully drawn characters			0
for the creators of the show , that 's music to our ears			0
" @entity57 said that he sees this priority not necessarily as a formula , but more of " a guiding principle of things that have worked			0
" " @entity5 has been very clear about not letting the story bog down the tone , " he said			2
" the feel of your show is more important than the police procedural details			0
if we are loving the characters and feeling a sense of entertainment and fun , then three clues to solve the crime is fine , not five			0
" this emphasis is what drew @entity95 to @entity5 shows in the first place , so much so that he eventually ended up doing research on the network 's programming theme			1
@entity95 , who just graduated from @entity100 in @entity101 with a master 's degree in popular culture , said he was intrigued by how the shows were tonally similar and yet often popular			2
in his university - approved thesis , " @entity106 ? : @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity5 's programming and @entity114 , " he explained how the network has carved its own niche			1
the show that really heralded the network 's present style was " @entity118 , " @entity95 found			0
when @entity120 's @entity119 , a brilliant detective with obsessive - compulsive disorder , was introduced in the summer of 2002 , @entity5 at that time was mostly known for reruns			1
@entity95 , who also runs a blog called @entity124 , argues that since then , @entity5 has branded itself with its " characters welcome " slogan to signify its shows ' " quirky , sort of left - of - center " personalities			1
these characters tend to work toward " the greater good " in ways not always in tandem with the law , have an overarching goal and happen to live in sunny locales			0
for example , the character of @entity118 solves crimes with his detailed - oriented abilities , lives in @entity140 and throughout the series is trying to figure out who murdered his wife			1
this pattern of elements or formula , @entity95 said , can be found in most of @entity5 's shows , making them recognizable and easy to pick up and consume			1
so audiences are loyal as they automatically have an idea of what the next @entity5 show will be like and view the network as unique			2
" if you are a person who likes @entity5 shows , you will probably like ' @entity6 , ' " @entity95 told @entity0			1
" you have watched nine shows like these , so why would n't i try this ? " @entity160 , a tv critic for @entity46 , has reviewed several @entity5 shows and summarized the cultural perception of the network this way : " they have a very clever , successful marketing position for themselves , as the home of these ' blue sky , ' mostly crime - based dramas with more of a comic twist than you would get on [ for instance ] fx			1
" blue skies , all season long the " blue sky " that @entity160 refers to is the approach or philosophy that @entity5 shows tend to have			1
the lighter theme is favored over a gloomy or gritty scenario because the objective is not to be overly somber , he said			0
" the cable dramas these days have become very serious , and the network procedurals tend to be in the darker side of crimes , " @entity160 said			0
" @entity5 shows tend to be glossier , on the sunnier side			1
" @entity186 's @entity5 series " @entity34 " is a good example			1
the show is about a con man named @entity190 ( @entity189 ) who , after getting caught by the @entity191 , helps them solve white - collar crimes using his expertise			0
@entity186 , the show 's creator executive producer and show runner , said that since the crimes mostly involve white collar offenses such as art forgery , the lighter elements of the crime are shown and stressed on			2
" ' @entity34 ' ... we 're a good prototype show for ' blue sky , ' what @entity5 is , " @entity186 said			2
" there 's a certain classy slickness to the show , just in the general world of police shows ... [ it 's ] pushing for that cleverness [ in a ] sort of high - end world			2
" a part of that slickness also comes from the shows ' locations			2
" @entity32 " is set in @entity218 , " @entity31 " in the @entity219 , " @entity220 " in @entity221 , all of which bring to mind warm weather , beaches and an abundance of sunshine			0
@entity186 said that for the @entity228 - set " @entity34 , " there is a tendency to shoot in places where the architecture can be exploited			0
@entity95 said that these settings , along with the warm weather timing of the premieres , capture the allure of summer and are all about escapism			0
" you are sort of immediately drawn to this place where you might want to take a vacation to , " he said			0
future of @entity5 many critics have pointed out that despite the likely success , @entity5 's cookie - cutter model for its shows can only go so far and that viewers might tire of similar series			1
but @entity246 , @entity5 's executive vice president of original scripted programming , said he does n't look at it that way			1
he said that when they go through show pitches , they certainly look for characters that stand out because of their background or relationships			0
however , @entity246 added that while the network focuses on a feel that " puts you in a good mindset " it is not the motivating factor			0
" we definitely stay away from the word ' formula , ' he said			0
" it 's a dirty word here			0
" @entity246 , who worked on " @entity118 " and " @entity220 " early in his career , said that @entity5 , like any other network , is evolving			1
when " @entity118 " was being developed , network executives at the time were not that interested in serialized character development or just procedurals			0
" in those days , we saw that there were not a lot of shows doing throwback , where you could mix comedy and drama , " @entity246 said			1
" where you did n't have to be so earnest and serious like ' @entity280 ' and ' csi			0
' " after the success of " @entity118 " and the fan - base growth of " @entity220 " and " @entity32 , " @entity246 said that @entity5 is encouraging its older shows to have continuous and rougher plots and is green lighting new shows such as " suits , " which have more edge			1
" @entity36 , " " @entity291 " and " @entity35 " not only deal with more provocative subjects , but also have female leads			0
@entity5 's political miniseries , " @entity293 , " starring @entity294 as the secretary of state , is set to premiere this july			1
@entity160 said that the new direction might be challenging because the blue sky and escapist vibe might not accurately portray real life -- such as the workings of a law firm in " suits " versus the workings of a law firm like in @entity59 ' " @entity305			0
" but he said that there is no need for @entity5 shows to compete with the more serious shows for the fear of becoming too formulaic			2
" i do n't think there is anything wrong with simple , enjoyable entertainment when you pull it off well , " @entity160 said .			0

new series " @entity6 " is set to kick off @entity5 's 2012 summer line - up
@entity5 's original series are often character - driven comedy - dramas set in beautiful locations
@entity246 , the executive *vp* of programming , said they are picking up edgier shows
