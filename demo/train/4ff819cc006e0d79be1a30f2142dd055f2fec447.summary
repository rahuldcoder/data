in two recent studies , researchers at @entity1 explored whether eating disorders are linked to social media use			1
the answer ? like that most awkward of @entity8 statuses says , it 's complicated			2
summaries in the @entity11 described the research			0
in the first study , 960 college women completed a self - reported eating disorder screening assessment			0
they also answered a series of questions about their @entity8 use			2
a " small but significant " positive correlation was found between duration of @entity8 use and disordered eating			2
in the second , 84 women from the first study were divided into two groups			0
one group was instructed to use @entity8 as they typically would for 20 minutes			2
the other group was told to research the ocelot , a rainforest cat , on @entity30 and @entity31			0
unsurprisingly , the women who spent 20 minutes on @entity8 reported greater body dissatisfaction than those who got to look at cute cat photos			2
the research shows that there is some connection between @entity8 use and disordered eating risk			1
( i do n't believe there is anything uniquely problematic about @entity8 as compared to other social media platforms ; it 's just the platform these researchers chose			1
) but the studies do not suggest that social media platforms should be held responsible for causing eating disorders			1
after all , we 're talking about a wide spectrum of illnesses that have complex biological , psychological and cultural roots			0
a simplistic blame game would be seriously misguided			1
we need more research to better understand this connection and , perhaps more important , how social media can be used as a positive tool for outreach , early intervention and recovery			1
i work with college students every day in my job overseeing the @entity63 's youth outreach			0
for those who struggle with poor body image , perfectionism or anxiety -- just a few of the many risk factors associated with disordered eating -- social media can be downright toxic			1
@entity8 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and their many new cousins do provide an unprecedented degree of access to images and messages that can entrench and sometimes trigger disordered eating thoughts and behaviors			1
frequent users of social media can end up feeling as though they 're alternating between broadcast and comparison modes , which are both dangerous places to be if you are prone to believing that your self - worth is based on others ' approval			1
" when i look at other people 's albums on @entity8 , the comparing is automatic			2
i end up feeling like crap			0
" this comment came to me from an 18 - year - old who participated in a @entity98 virtual roundtable on how social media affects teens ' body image			1
it is a sentiment i hear expressed constantly in my work			0
back when i was caught up in my own eating disorder as a teen , i used to stare at my thighs in the mirror , wishing they could be as thin as those of models in the pictures i tore out of magazines			0
there were no hashtags like # thighgap , which have turned appearance - related fixations into searchable universes with neverending streams of photos and " thinspirational " text			0
i wanted desperately to be liked , but there were no " likes " or " hearts " for me log on to watch and tally			0
the point is that the obsessions , compulsions and comparisons that drive eating disorders are nothing new			1
social media have just amplified them			1
but it also has the potential to amplify solutions			0
we need to figure out how we can most effectively use it to promote media literacy , self - acceptance , support , recovery and body image activism			0
some might choose to unplug from social media to protect their mental health ; there 's a reason that most residential eating disorder treatment centers ban social media use among patients			1
but the reality is that most people at risk or actively struggling with disordered eating use social media in some way			1
the good news is that social media give us all the ability to be content curators , media makers and rabble rousers			1
if you want to fill your feed with messages of body acceptance , you can choose pages and accounts to follow that will deliver those messages			0
sure , i still have to report spammy " belly busting " advertising , but the content i see and share through social media reflects my values and interests -- and i have no interest in seeing anything related to weight loss or body shaming			2
rather than consuming and internalizing media toxicity , we can use social media talk back to a culture that makes us feel like we 're never good enough			2
for example , 19 - year - old @entity184 , who is recovering from anorexia , started a @entity188 petition reprimanding @entity190 's ceo for comments saying the company was intentionally exclusionary and calling for it to include plus sizes			0
more than 80,000 people signed his petition , and @entity190 recently announced that it will carry plus sizes , starting this spring			0
just last week was @entity197			0
it was the most successful in the organization 's history ; the @entity202 hashtag had a reach of 23 million during that week , and that social media awareness does translate to an increase in people seeking help			1
we saw it in the increased volume of calls to the helpline and visits to the website			0
we saw it in the stories and photos of hope shared on @entity74 , @entity73 , @entity72 and @entity8			2
social media can stoke body dissatisfaction and reinforce disordered eating			1
it can also empower individuals to use their voices and resist mainstream media messages about beauty and thinness			1
let 's keep working to understand the nuances of those risks and leverage the benefits to build a movement of change .			0

new research considers whether @entity8 contributes to eating disorders
@entity237 writes that it 's too simplistic to blame social media
@entity8 and other social media sites can be helpful in fight against eating disorders
@entity237 : they can " empower individuals to use their voices " and resist *negative* messages
