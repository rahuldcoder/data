-- " in my old school , they used to beat people			0
like you have to bring firewood in school , carry the water and you have to carry all of that and you have to be there early in the morning			0
if you 're late , you 'll be given a punishment , you 'll be caned or sent home for a week			0
" the memories of 13 - year - old @entity14 are crystal clear as she considers what her life was like before meeting @entity18 and @entity19			1
five years ago , she was living in an orphanage in @entity21 , the largest city in northern @entity22 , and she wanted a better education than her circumstances provided			1
" i told them maybe if you take me to another school , maybe i can do better , " @entity14 recalls			0
it was her request for a better school that sparked a direct change in the lives of the @entity31 , who are @entity33 natives			1
it all began with @entity36 's first trip to @entity22 as a volunteer			1
eventually @entity19 joined him , and the pair spent time volunteering for the same orphanage where @entity14 lived			1
as their relationship with the children in @entity21 grew , so did their personal desire to help " my husband and i both grew up in @entity33			1
my husband is from rural south @entity33 , and i was from rural north @entity33 , a very segregated society			1
we grew up during the @entity51 era , which changed our world			0
i never thought when i was a child growing up that i would ever be in , ever visit @entity53 much less come here as often as we do , " @entity19 says			1
the @entity54 came to love each one of the six children who later came into their guardianship and a part of @entity58			1
" we were very concerned that as the children aged out of the orphanage that they would return to the same poverty that they came from , and along about this time , one of the older girls that we had a very close relationship with told us she wanted to go to a better school			1
so we looked at the public school that she went to and there were over 100 children in a classroom , " @entity19 says			1
" we started looking into the schools for the children in @entity21 ( @entity14 , @entity76 and @entity77 ) that we thought would be good candidates , and about that time we met two other children ( @entity80 and @entity81 ) who were extremely gifted			2
we just overnight had five children enrolled in @entity83 , which is in @entity84			2
that was two years ago , and all five of the children are either competing ( with ) or exceeding the children of privilege who have been in this school for their entire education			1
" a sixth child , 10 - year - old @entity92 , was recently added and attends @entity93			2
@entity94 , which is a day school in the same town			0
in the past year , she has blossomed academically and loves karate			0
" i prayed to @entity102 that he might help me find a new school , a better one so that when i grow up , i can be a missionary and help the other children			2
i want to be a missionary because i just wanted to help the other kids how i was helped , " @entity92 says			0
@entity92 lived in rural @entity21 before meeting the @entity31 and now says her prayers were answered			0
" the new school is good , it 's better , it 's awesome			2
" @entity19 feels that the personal attention each child receives from their @entity58 sponsor is the literal key to each child 's success			1
" what we think really makes a difference is not just putting these children in a private school and seeing them and looking at test grades , but we feel it 's extremely important to provide mentors , people in the @entity124 who care for these kids , who are willing to contact them either through e-mail , @entity127 , other social media , visit , phone calls			1
we think that 's what sets this program apart			1
" each of the @entity58 kids has a passion for learning			1
@entity92 wants to become a missionary and help children like herself			2
@entity80 wants to be a forensic psychologist to better understand why people commit crimes			0
@entity143 wants to make @entity22 beautiful by becoming a civil engineer			1
@entity76 is passionate about aviation and wants to become a pilot			0
@entity14 would like to become a doctor			0
and @entity81 is planning to become a neurosurgeon			0
@entity19 says @entity58 is committed to providing an education to each one , all the way through college graduation			1
high school seniors @entity80 and @entity81 are anxiously preparing for as their school year comes to an end			2
" we 're testing some uncharted waters with the two older ones			0
we have schools in the @entity124 that are interested in them , so at this point , we are perusing student visas , and they 'll be taking the sat in january just to see where they can go			0
that does n't mean we would not consider university in @entity22 , it just so happens that for both of them the education that they would need to pursue the vocation they want , they would have to go outside @entity22 either to the @entity173 or to the @entity124 " and these children , the two older ones in particular , have never had the benefit of a family , and we would very selfishly like to have them in @entity33 schools so they could spend their breaks with us and be part of a family because that 's , i think in the end , what matters is to have the love			1
" " we are a family			0
that is , yeah we come from far , we may be different biologically ; but living together we embrace each other , " @entity81 says with a smile			0
it 's a sentiment echoed by each child , including 15 - year - old @entity76			2
" they 're like my brothers and sisters , like a family			0
" and 13 - year - old @entity14 says , " i feel like they are my mommy and my daddy			2
the way they take care of me [ is ] like i 'm their real daughter , and i 'm so happy for that			0
" it 's a love that crosses two continents , an ocean and cultural barriers with an aim to impact the world one child at a time .			0

growing up , @entity33 natives @entity18 and @entity19 never imagined they would visit @entity53
the couple first traveled to @entity22 to volunteer with children at an orphanage
the @entity19 's *founded* @entity58 to help the children *transition* to *adulthood* and out of poverty
providing high - *quality* education and personal mentors is central to the program 's mission
