more than a week after the @entity2 terror attacks and with an investigation in full swing , the evidence points to an international conspiracy by militants to bring terror to the streets of @entity11 's capital			1
there are reports of a new accomplice , in addition to the three gunmen killed by @entity11 authorities and the widow of one , who escaped			1
there 's a money trail that points to @entity22 and a cache of weapons reportedly found in an apartment			2
this all comes as a nation continues to mourn and @entity28 flock to newsstands in support of the satirical magazine targeted by the terrorists			2
everyone seems to want a piece of history			2
three million copies of @entity37 's first edition since the terrorist attacks flew off newsstand racks wednesday			1
another million or so went on sale thursday			2
the cover features a cartoon of the @entity43 crying as he holds a sign saying " @entity45 , " or " i am @entity45 , " beneath the headline " all is forgiven			1
" this run of the magazine could reach 5 million copies			2
some have criticized the magazine 's decision to depict @entity43 , however , since this is deeply offensive to many @entity54			2
the government of @entity56 condemned the move thursday , saying that continuing to publish " offensive drawings " of @entity43 would " hurt the feelings of the @entity60 communities everywhere			1
" this irresponsible act " does not represent the freedom of expression , which is based on the foundation of the responsibility and the respect of religions , " its statement added			2
freedom of expression is a right , but there are limits when it comes to insulting faiths , @entity70 told reporters thursday , referring to events surrounding the @entity37 attacks			1
" one can not provoke , one can not insult other people 's faith , one can not make fun of faith , " @entity70 said on a flight from @entity81 , @entity82 , to the @entity83			2
likewise , he said , people have religious liberty , but " one ca n't kill in the name of @entity91			2
" he said this after a reporter asked him about religious liberty and freedom of expression			2
@entity70 noted that the reporter was @entity11 , and he framed his answer with the @entity2 attacks : " you are @entity11 ? let 's ( reference ) @entity2 , let 's speak clearly			1
" @entity104 's @entity103 on thursday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the publication of a caricature of the @entity43 by @entity37 , @entity104 's @entity108 reported			1
the resolution also calls on the @entity110 , the @entity112 community and the @entity113 take steps to prevent the publishing of such material , according to the report			1
@entity104 joins other predominantly @entity60 countries whose leaders have spoken out against @entity37 for its latest publication			1
prime minister @entity128 " said that freedom of speech should not be used to hurt the religious sentiments of any community " and that the world should discourage the " publication of provocative material			0
" more funerals for victims of the violence were held thursday			0
they included ceremonies for policeman @entity134 , @entity37 cartoonists @entity135 and @entity137 , and columnist and psychoanalyst @entity138			1
all were killed in last week 's attack on @entity37 's offices			1
magazine staffers and contributors were gathered for an editorial meeting when , authorities said , brothers @entity146 and @entity147 burst into the newsroom and gunned down staffers , killing 12 and wounding 11			0
one positive story emerged from friday 's deadly siege at a kosher grocery store in @entity2 , just two days after the @entity37 rampage			1
it was that of @entity156 , a @entity158 @entity60 immigrant and supermarket employee who said he helped some hostages into a walk - in freezer at the store while it was under attack			1
on thursday , @entity11 interior minister @entity164 said @entity11 would grant him @entity11 citizenship , according to a statement			1
the @entity11 government expedited @entity156 's application , which he filed in july 2014			1
@entity164 himself will conduct the citizenship ceremony on january 20			1
nearly 300,000 signatures have been added to a @entity173 petition calling for @entity156 to receive @entity11 citizenship and @entity11 's prestigious @entity174			1
in a speech at the @entity177 , @entity11 president @entity175 said that @entity54 " are the first victims of fanaticism , fundamentalism and intolerance " and that @entity54 was compatible with democracy			1
@entity183 claimed responsibility wednesday for @entity186 shooting			0
the attack was years in the making , @entity183 commander @entity187 said in a video , claiming @entity192 - born cleric @entity191 was the mastermind behind it			0
@entity194 was the terror group 's spokesman before a @entity192 drone strike killed him in @entity22 in 2011			0
for days , intelligence analysts have been trying to piece together whether the @entity147 brothers , the gunmen who attacked the magazine , met him on trips to @entity22 -- a theory that could be bolstered by the new video 's claim			0
what is @entity183 ? @entity205 praised the magazine attack , saying it was revenge for @entity37 's depictions of @entity43			1
@entity192 authorities said they think the video is authentic			0
but they were n't ready to say that @entity183 helped carry out the assault			0
@entity183 did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it			1
" it was a blessing from @entity217 " that the store siege , in which four hostages were killed , took place about the same time , @entity187 said			2
@entity11 security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack , according to the @entity11 newspaper @entity224			1
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice , a man from a @entity2 suburb , may have driven gunman @entity231 to the kosher supermarket , where @entity231 later shot dead four people			1
@entity231 was killed in a police raid to end the siege			2
the @entity147 brothers also are dead			0
but investigators ' efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week 's attacks are continuing			0
@entity224 's report said investigators identified @entity231 's suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend			2
neighbors told @entity5 the apartment , in the @entity2 suburb of @entity251 , was raided saturday by police			0
also found inside the apartment , according to @entity224 : a stash of weapons , explosives and two @entity258 flags			0
@entity231 purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to @entity258			0
police also think the suspected accomplice may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week -- an attack that the @entity2 prosecutor has said could be tied to @entity231 because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack , @entity224 said			2
@entity2 police would not comment to @entity5 on the contents of the report			2
@entity224 says @entity231 's suspected accomplice , whom the newspaper did not name , may have fled @entity11 , possibly for @entity275			1
officials have also said they believe @entity277 , @entity231 's widow , may have played a role in the attacks and has fled to @entity275			0
@entity231 and @entity277 drove from @entity11 to @entity284 on december 31 , a @entity281 source close to the nation 's security sources told @entity5			1
@entity231 remained until january 2 , when he returned to @entity11 , while @entity277 flew that same day from @entity284 to @entity285 , the source said			1
@entity281 security authorities are investigating what @entity231 and @entity277 did while in @entity284 , and are trying to determine where they stayed , whom they had contact with , and whether they had any support in @entity281			0
@entity294 , a reporter for @entity295 , a @entity296 newspaper , said that on january 5 , two days before the @entity37 attack , police searched the hotel where @entity277 stayed in @entity300 , @entity285			1
police took all the digital registration records on the hotel 's computer , including video recordings within the hotel			0
@entity307 federal prosecutors told @entity5 on thursday that a man is under arrest in @entity310 in connection with arms trafficking			0
they said he recently bought a car from @entity277			0
prosecutors said the man was " known to police " but could n't be directly linked to @entity231			0
according to @entity307 media , the man went to police after learning about last week 's shootings			0
they then searched his house and found documents that matched the type of gun @entity231 used in @entity2			0
@entity5 has not been able to independently confirm the details of the raid on the man 's home or the documents found , after contacting police			0
@entity192 officials have told @entity5 it 's believed that when @entity147 traveled to @entity22 in 2011 , he returned carrying money from @entity183 earmarked to carry out the attack			0
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as $ 20,000 , but the exact amount has not been verified			0
@entity11 newspaper @entity335 reports that @entity231 also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket			1
he got the loan for $ 7,000 ( 6,000 euros ) from the @entity340 in @entity341 , in northern @entity11			1
the paper reported the amount that @entity231 borrowed was not high enough to require an explanation of how the money would be spent			0
he took out the loan in december			0
@entity192 president @entity347 and @entity349 prime minister @entity348 are expected to discuss the @entity2 attacks when they meet thursday and friday in @entity351			0

" we will continue to stand together against those who threaten our values and our way of life , " they said in thursday 's edition			0
