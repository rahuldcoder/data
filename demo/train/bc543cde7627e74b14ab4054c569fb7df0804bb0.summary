@entity0 -- in a warm , fluorescent - lit clay studio at the @entity6 , students , faculty and a soft - spoken priest are embarking on a mission			1
their goal : create 500 bowls for a fundraiser to help feed the hungry			1
" there are over 9,000 homeless people in the nation 's capital , " says the rev. @entity11 , who has been trying to break the cycle of homelessness and hunger in @entity0 for more than 30 years as president of @entity16			1
the interfaith , community - based organization , which is in its 40th year , serves more than 1,000 meals a day and provides nearly 300 housing units to homeless and hungry people in @entity0			1
" we are in sight of the @entity27 and still we have many , many homeless people who need our help , " @entity11 said			2
" we 've seen over a 10 percent increase in the meals we are serving this past year			0
we 've seen a 17 percent increase in the people coming to our medical clinic			0
our housing we provide is 100 percent full			0
" [ the recession ] is really affecting the poor			0
" each year , so others might eat hosts an @entity41 event where , for a $ 20 donation , guests are served a soup supper and given a handmade clay bowl			1
the events raise thousands of dollars for the organization , with local potters , studios and schools making and donating the bowls , and restaurants and shops donating the food			1
this year , for the first time , the group is partnering with the @entity57 to help supply bowls for the fundraiser in march 2010			1
the bowls are intended as symbols of hunger			2
" it 's a wonderful event to have these artists come here today to help feed the needy in our city , " @entity11 says			0
however , making bowls is no easy task			1
" we are working on a collaborative effort with @entity73 might eat , " says @entity69 , coordinator of ceramics at the @entity6			1
" we promised to produce 500 bowls for their charity fundraiser			1
" the studio is busy at work , with students and faculty -- and even @entity11 -- cutting , kneading and spinning the clay into works of art. @entity57 student @entity83 has been working with clay for 10 years , but he 's still excited to sit down and create bowls that someone will put to use			1
" it 's great to spend an entire day making bowls and thinking about what they will be used for , @entity83 said			2
" we get to sit next to our fellow students and learn their techniques			2
it 's a fun activity for us at the clay program			0
" @entity83 sits on his stool contently , gazing at the clay shape as it opens up into a bowl , thinking about what will go inside			0
" it 's going to have a life after it comes off this wheel , after it gets fired and glazed , it will be used for something			0
" as @entity11 takes a break from designing his first bowl , he looks around and talks with students and faculty			2
he ca n't help but be impressed			0
" we have great artists and great people here who are interested in helping people in the city , " he says			0
taking time to donate their creative energies , especially during the holiday season , means a lot to @entity11			0
" the holidays remind us of giving thanks for what we have , but also the opportunities we have for reaching out to others that do n't have , " he says .			0
