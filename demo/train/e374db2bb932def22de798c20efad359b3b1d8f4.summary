@entity0 -- it sits in the ancient heart of @entity4 and is an emblem of the city 's imperial history as well as an icon of @entity9			0
but plans to restore @entity4 's nearly 2,000 - year - old @entity11 are causing rumblings among heritage workers and restorers , compounded by reports in december that small amounts of powdery rock had fallen off the monument			1
the current $ 33 million ( 25 million euro ) restoration plans to restore the @entity11 , which once hosted spectacular shows and gruesome gladiatorial battles , are being sponsored by @entity22 , of luxury @entity9 brand @entity23 , in exchange for advertising rights			1
restoration of the monument , which attracts up to two million visitors a year , is due to go ahead in march and will involve cleaning of the travertine exterior , the restoration of underground chambers , new gating , the moving of visitor service stations to an area outside of the building itself and increased video security			2
but members of the @entity42 of @entity9 are unhappy about the plans , which they believe has sidelined them in favor of non-specialist restorers and which " run the risk of causing irreparable damage to the monument , " according to the group 's president , @entity49			1
" having some of the best restorers in the world in @entity9 and yet turning to general enterprises is a choice that we do not share , and embarrasses both our work and the image of our nation in the world , in addition to causing risks to the monument , " @entity51 said			2
a ruling given late december 2011 by @entity9 's @entity64 in favor of the @entity66 and @entity67 is however allowing the restoration plans to go ahead			2
" @entity9 law states that restorers can restore things like statues , ceramics , mosaics and decorative surfaces but not architecture , " said @entity69 , director of the @entity11 , adding that the workers employed to do the restorations are in fact " specialized in architectural restoration , they 're not just ordinary workmen			1
" @entity69 was also quick to stress that the reports of the @entity11 crumbling were false and that only 8cm of tuff -- a porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash -- had come off , something " that happens all the time to monuments			2
" but she also added that the @entity11 has suffered in recent years from underfunding caused by government cuts and that the revenue from ticket sales only covers the yearly upkeep of the city 's ancient sites , which include the nearby forum and @entity98			1
sponsorship , though difficult to obtain owing to sponsors having to pay @entity100 on donations , is much - needed			0
@entity103 is secretary general of @entity104 , an organization dedicated to protecting cultural heritage in @entity106			0
she said , " we at @entity104 and anyone dealing with heritage would say that it 's wonderful to have private companies and individuals wanting to support heritage at a time when public budgets are being cut			0
" but she also warned against governments across @entity106 loosening restrictions on restoration work in the current economic climate , and of privately funded restoration plans not complying with strict guidelines			1
and while the current @entity11 project aims to improve visitor services in addition to cleaning and restoring the amphitheater , @entity122 - @entity103 believes that its underlying problems also need to be addressed -- the main one being the car traffic that surrounds the site and causes the exterior to be tarnished with pollution			1
" you can do wonderful restoration works but you have n't yet tackled the things that will continue to cause damage and this is an issue at the level of the urban management of the city , " she said			0
" it 's a problem that 's been discussed with the @entity4 for many years , " said @entity69 , adding that she hopes that with the building of a new subway stop near the @entity11 , the roads around the site will be closed to cars -- though heritage workers have long complained that vibrations from the nearby subway trains are also damaging the building			0
it 's an ongoing struggle , @entity69 said , but one she hopes will eventually be successful			0
after all , it 's only been 60 years since people parked their cars inside the amphitheater .			0

plans to restore ancient @entity11 meet with anger from @entity160
restorers allege privately - funded plans will use non-specialist builders to clean and restore amphitheater
@entity167 *refutes* claim , says restoration project is hiring architectural restorers , " not just workmen . "
monument in need of funds and protection measures including cessation of car traffic around it
