your first view of @entity2 on @entity4 's @entity3 is of majestic rock , postcard - worthy waves and miles of uninhabited beach			1
but look closer at the sand and you see specks of blue , yellow and white plastic			2
a piece of a bottle cap			2
a corner of a milk crate			2
@entity2 is part of the devastating legacy of the march 2011 @entity21 tsunami			1
" it 's disheartening to come out here and see all this marine debris in an area that 's otherwise so remote , debris that 's washing up from other countries , " said @entity22 , debris project coordinator for the @entity24			1
@entity4 is in a unique geographical spot , the center of the @entity33 , to witness the impact of the @entity21 tsunami			1
debris swirls from @entity36 to the continental @entity37 through @entity4			1
the islands are , in effect , a comb of the @entity33			2
the nonprofit @entity24 said marine debris has been a problem for years for the island state and tsunami debris has made things worse			1
according to @entity21 , 1.5 million tons of tsunami debris floated away			1
the wildlife fund organizes beach cleanups along @entity4 's shorelines and struggles to keep up with the marine debris , made up primarily of plastic			1
@entity22 pulled out part of a beer crate that read " exclusively for @entity54 " in @entity21			1
she also found a @entity56 bottle stamped " @entity21			1
" @entity22 also found a small vitamin drink container with @entity21 text			1
since fall , the wildlife fund and the @entity60 have found refrigerators , freezers , buoys and even an intact fishing boat , all with @entity21 text			1
but most disturbing to @entity22 are a couple of soft plastic bottles with bite marks			2
" @entity69 life in the ocean are mistaking plastic for their natural food , " @entity22 said			2
@entity22 may suspect it , but @entity75 , a @entity60 fishery biologist with the observer program , can confirm it			1
@entity75 has been studying the impact of marine debris in fish			1
in her lab , @entity75 sliced open the stomach of a lancetfish for @entity84			2
you may never have heard of the lancetfish , a sometimes 4 - to 6 - foot long fish with enormous teeth			1
but bigeye and yellow fin tuna eat lancetfish			0
tuna ends up on our plates			0
@entity75 pulled out a 12 by 12 piece of indigestible black plastic			0
" it would be difficult to pass through the system , " said @entity75			0
" i 've found several fish with the same black plastic bag , just like this , even larger			1
if it gets to a certain size , the fish is going to feel like it 's full			1
" @entity75 conducted a study that included 64 fish of varying species			1
twelve percent of them , she said , contained plastic			0
when she looked just at lancetfish , 45 % had plastic			0
" one concern that we have and do n't know is if any chemicals from the plastic are absorbed into the tissue of the fish , which is a problem if consumed by a fish that we consume			2
that 's definitely the next step , what is the impact ? " across the island in @entity125 's lab , the impact of plastic debris is apparent among the animal species he studies : birds			2
@entity125 cut open the bellies of some albatross for @entity84			0
plastic pieces spilled out of the belly of a 2 - month - old albatross			0
eighty percent of the stomach was packed with plastic			0
@entity125 , an assistant professor of oceanography at @entity137 , pulled out a small bottle top			0
" toothpaste top ? " he said			0
" no , cap of a medicine tube			0
" he reached into the stomach again			0
" oh , it 's a brush , you see ? " there were the unmistakable bristles of a hairbrush			0
" morally , this is terrible			0
how is this possible ? @entity151 , far ranging , beautiful birds , in a pristine place of the pacific , the northwest @entity150 , you open them up and this is what you find , " said @entity125			0
he grabbed a box , packed with toy soldiers , lighters and brushes			0
he explained that he pulled all the items out of albatross from @entity4			1
" every bird i looked at had plastic			0
some had a little bit			0
everybody we looked at had plastic			0
" @entity60 said most of the debris affecting the island can not be tracked to any particular country , even @entity21 , because the plastic is often so weathered and broken by the time it hits @entity4			1
" we do n't really know the full impact of this type of debris			2
it adds to an existing problem that we have across the world , " said @entity178			0
" but it is quite eerie to see an item you think may have come from @entity21 , someone 's home , to sit on a beach thousands of miles away			1
it brings home the fact beyond the marine debris issue this is first and foremost a human tragedy			2
" it should serve as a reminder , @entity191 said , that " the land and the oceans are incredibly connected			0

debris apparently from 2011 @entity21 tsunami is washing ashore in @entity4
@entity24 organizes beach cleanups
@entity60 has been studying the effects of debris on fish
