@entity0 spotted @entity2 one day in 2005 while she was walking down the aisle of an @entity5 flight from @entity6 to @entity7			1
@entity2 was sitting in @entity0 's window seat			1
and she was n't happy about it			1
" i hope i 'm not sitting beside him , " she recalls thinking			2
@entity2 had the opposite thought			1
" i saw this beautiful lady , and i thought , ' i hope she 's sitting here , ' " he remembers			2
@entity2 was correct -- @entity0 was sitting in the same row			1
not that he switched seats			2
@entity0 grudgingly took the open center seat			2
" he seemed nice and pleasant , " she says , hoping that someone as well - dressed and well - groomed as @entity2 was probably a gentleman			1
" i do n't think we 'd even left the tarmac , and we started talking			1
" except for one gap , they 've barely stopped since -- through long - distance phone calls , a 2011 wedding and now as parents of two boys			2
it was n't love at first sight , however			1
more like comfort , which developed into a close friendship			0
after all , they were separated by thousands of miles : @entity0 owned her own business in @entity36 and @entity2 was a long - distance truck driver based in @entity37			1
but they talked -- for hours			0
@entity2 says his phone bills used to be in the four figures			1
" my phone bill was like a mortgage , " he chuckles			0
" i would go over my minutes and be calling @entity44 and asking , ' is there any way you could work with me ? ' " the friendship appeared to have run its course in 2008			0
the two lost touch but still thought of one another			0
for @entity2 , @entity0 was the " the girl that got away " ; for @entity0 , @entity2 was a special memory			1
there was one time when @entity0 called @entity57 and he did n't recognize her voice			1
and he tried other social media services , including @entity60 , hoping to stumble across her			0
but @entity61 put them together again in 2010			0
" i sent her a message , and she responded the following day , " @entity2 says			1
" once we started talking again , it was like we picked up where we left off			0
" " he did n't waste any time , " adds @entity0 , who says she was in a better place for a relationship			2
@entity0 ended up moving to @entity37			0
they were married 10 months later			0
what 's the secret to their " fairy tale , " as @entity0 calls it ? trust , honesty and respect , they say			0
and " communication is key , " @entity0 adds			0
she wishes to thank @entity5 , @entity61 and @entity44 for helping bring them together			0
incidentally , they now have an unlimited plan .			0

@entity2 and @entity85 met on a plane in 2005
the two *bonded* almost immediately , but the timing was n't right until years later
