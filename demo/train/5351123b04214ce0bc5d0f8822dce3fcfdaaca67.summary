-- it was late , the football game was over , and i was ready for bed			0
the problem was , i could n't find the remote control			1
it was n't right next to me on the couch in my hotel room and i was too lazy -- or drunk -- to dig between the cushions to look for it			1
so after a couple of glances , i decided to just turn the tv off manually and worry about finding the remote in the morning			1
i slid my hand down the sides , ran my fingers across the top , bent down and looked along the bottom and even tried tapping the screen , as if it were a 48 " @entity23			0
now , again -- i had been drinking			0
but i do n't think @entity25 and @entity26 were the reasons why i had no idea how to turn the tv off			1
as i was fumbling around looking for something that looked like a power button , it dawned on me : i had n't manually turned off a television in years			1
eventually i grew tired of looking and decided to just unplug the damn thing and take my drunken self to bed			0
and this is what technology has turned me and i suspect many @entity38 into : automated idiot savants			1
tell me , how many people with smartphones actually know their boyfriend 's or girlfriend 's telephone number and can dial it from memory ? i 've been with my partner for three years and after the area code , i could n't tell you a single digit that 's in his number			1
we met one night , exchanged numbers and i have n't dialed it since			1
special series : our mobile society funny -- i used to joke that if i ever lost all of the contacts backed up on my computer , i would n't be able to call my own mama			1
now i realize that i really was n't joking			2
i do n't know my mama 's number			1
not only that , i do n't know her address either			2
i know where she lives , but if i was suddenly cut off from all technology , i would have to get in my car and drive three hours just to say " hi			1
" all of which brings me to this : for all of the wonderful conveniences technology has brought into our lives , there is something to be said about all of the little things that have been lost because of these advancements as well			1
like knowing by heart the telephone numbers of the people we care about			2
stopping in a gas station and asking another human being for directions			0
going to a record store			0
i can remember spending hours with my high school friends roaming the @entity92 record store in downtown @entity93			0
the first 45 i ever bought was @entity98 's " @entity97 , " and i can remember my black friends teasing me for liking " white people 's music			2
" now , i am sure on some level i am simply romanticizing life before @entity101			0
i am not against the technological progress we 've made -- i 'm just trying to put it into context			0
technology can deliver a song faster to us , but there are some things in life that ca n't be rushed			1
to this day , i still think " @entity97 " is one of the greatest songs of all time			0
but more importantly , the interaction that came from purchasing that song as well as other conversations that occurred in that store over the years helped shape me into the person i am today			2
you know , my son hates it when i tell him to grab a dictionary whenever he asks me how to spell a word he ca n't figure out with spellcheck			1
" @entity125 , just tell me , " he would say			0
and i would say , " no , otherwise you wo n't learn			2
" do n't get me wrong , spell - check 's a great tool , and i use it			2
but it pays to know the long way in case you ca n't take the shortcut			2
i have seen my penmanship become increasingly illegible over the past 20 years because despite being a writer , i do n't really write			1
and so over time , using a keyboard exclusively has led to a degree of atrophy in my writing hand			0
now i can barely get through handwriting a personal note in a greeting card before noticing a little pain or soreness			0
some people may wonder what all the fuss is about			2
it 's no big deal that i do n't know by heart my loved ones ' phone numbers , as long as i have them programmed in my phone			1
right ? it 's easy and convenient and efficient			0
i guess i 'm wondering if technology has gone from assisting us in our lives to taking over our lives			1
in a recent @entity160 survey , 54 % of the responders said it was ok to pick up the phone while out to dinner and 57 % said they 'd pick it up while going to the bathroom			0
but the thing that really got me is that 33 % thinks it 's ok to pick up their cell phone during sex			0
sex ! ! ? ? ! ! that 's when i think this whole technology take over goes from being funny to a bit sad			0
( unless they 're taking pictures ... in which case i say , carry on			0
