" no matter how you start your match you need to make your opponent work hard , " @entity98 told @entity110 after seeing off a disappointing @entity104			1
" i did n't hit it unbelievable today but i worked hard			0
once i got the breakthrough he made mistakes			0
but it is unbelievably hot and windy			0

@entity124 overcame @entity128 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 to secure his place in the next round			1
" i started out a little slow , " he told the tournament 's official website			0
