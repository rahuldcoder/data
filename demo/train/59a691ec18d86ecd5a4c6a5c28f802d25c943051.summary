@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 team have had their vote -- now it is time to have yours ; as the decade draws to a close , which sport people would you place in a top 10 of achievers from the last 10 years ? it is a tough call to select the cream of the @entity16 ' crop , especially in a decade of enthralling sporting achievement , but after much thought , discussion and deliberation the @entity3 team have had their say			1
the top 10 of @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 / @entity34 hold few surprises for sport aficionados , but what of those who did not make the final cut ? @entity40 and @entity41 dominated @entity42 and the @entity43 in the same vein as @entity27 ruled over @entity45 since the turn of the century , yet they are left from the top 10			1
similarly , though @entity28 's smashing of the 100 and 200 meter men 's world records was spectacular , who could say the athletic success of @entity54 distance runner @entity53 and @entity57 pole vaulter @entity55 were less deserving of admiration			0
and though some sports are more international than others , is it right that careers such as those of cricketers @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity68 's @entity67 or baseball slugger @entity69 have been overlooked in the final analysis ? a surprise too maybe that soccer , despite its global popularity and its wealth of star names ( @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 ) , secured only the last place in the official list			0
criticism aside , however , some of the selections have been met with the approval of authoritative names from the world of sport			0
in a recent panel discussion with @entity92 members @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity89 , @entity89 told @entity3 anchor @entity96 that @entity28 was worthy of his place : " when you look at @entity28 , when he first broke the 100 meter record , it was only the fourth time he raced at that distance			1
he still has a lot to improve on , but he is extraordinary			0
every so often you have an athlete that comes along who is more naturally gifted than the rest of the field			0
" @entity95 also added that it was right for @entity25 to appear prominently in the list : " after already winning 13 grand slams most tennis players would have been happy , but he went onto to win his first @entity116 title in 2009 before winning at @entity117 again			2
" i 've played against ( @entity119 ) @entity118 , ( @entity121 ) @entity120 , ( @entity123 ) @entity122 , ( @entity125 ) @entity124 , ( @entity127 ) @entity126 and ( @entity129 ) @entity128 -- and it is amazing to be around someone like @entity25 who is rewriting all of the records set by these men , " @entity95 added			2
