-- @entity1 is placing big stakes on the success of this week 's @entity5 summit in @entity6			1
" it is a recognition of the new @entity1 that emerged since 2003 by its new leaders , its new constitution , its new policies , its new political system at the heart of the @entity14 , " @entity1 foreign minister @entity7 said monday			1
" this summit could truly be called the @entity4 , " he declared			1
previous summits included @entity18 leaders who no longer hold power due to the uprisings in several nations , including the late @entity23 leader @entity22 , former @entity25 president @entity24 , former @entity28 president @entity27 @entity26 , and former @entity29			2
@entity7 described the summit as " the most important event for @entity1			1
" it will mark the first time @entity18 leaders have held the summit in @entity1 since 1990			1
the summit will take place thursday , but it is considered a three - day event because many leaders begin gathering tuesday			2
the country is spending more than half a billion dollars on it , @entity7 said			1
@entity43 president @entity42 has highlighted the summit 's importance as well			1
" for the first time in two decades , @entity1 is scheduled to host the next @entity5 summit			1
and what a powerful message that will send throughout the @entity18 world , " he said in a december news conference with @entity1 prime minister @entity50			1
" people throughout the region will see a new @entity1 that 's determining its own destiny , a country in which people from different religious sects and ethnicities can resolve their differences peacefully through the democratic process			1
" the gathering tests @entity1 's ability to provide critical organization and security in the country where deadly violence remains a weekly norm			1
it was originally scheduled to be held in @entity6 last year , but was postponed due to the unrest			0
last week a militant group with links to @entity74 claimed responsibility for a deadly wave of bombings , saying they were designed to undermine security for the summit			2
the blasts were meant to target the security plan " of the government of fools inside the @entity84 , in preparation of the meeting of @entity18 tyrants in @entity6 , " said a statement from the @entity89 , an umbrella group that includes @entity74 in @entity1			1
the @entity90 said " all protective measures " have been taken to host the delegations and media at the summit			2
in a statement , the ministry described the summit as a " great political achievement that suits @entity1 's importance and geopolitical position in the region			1
" it slammed terrorists " racing to prove their propaganda presence by carrying out hysterical acts aiming to affect the atmosphere of the summit			2
" unprecedented security measures are in place for the event			0
while the interior ministry has said it 's unlikely roads will be closed off or a curfew will be imposed , the capital already appears to be in a state of lockdown			0
most of the main roads in central @entity6 , including those leading to the @entity84 -- the highly fortified area that includes government buildings -- have been cut off to vehicle traffic			0
cars are being thoroughly inspected at checkpoints , causing hours - long delays			0
but similar checkpoints did not stop the large - scale bombings that recently hit the capital			0
following those attacks , @entity1 announced a national holiday from march 25 to april 1			1
the traffic jams and additional security measures are keeping most people indoors -- and many who still need to get to their jobs are making their way on foot			0
" how can we survive , how can we live ? " asked @entity140 , a street vendor			0
" i live from day to day and i make about $ 10 @entity43 a day to support my family			0
now how can i support my family in those coming days ? " " this is not the time for this summit , " said another angry @entity6 resident			0
" if it was the right time , they would not have to shut everything down ...			0
for weeks they have been planning on how to protect @entity18 leaders while @entity1 are not protected			1
" but @entity1 leaders insist the summit is shaping up to be a success			1
all member nations plan to attend , except @entity157 , @entity7 said monday			1
@entity157 was not invited because its membership was suspended amid a violent government crackdown on an uprising , the league includes 20 countries in addition to @entity1 and @entity157			1
@entity7 said it 's unusual to attract leaders from all the invited countries			0
he did not say who would represent each country			0
one leader who will attend is @entity171 president @entity170 , who is wanted by the @entity172 on charges of war crimes and genocide			0
@entity1 state television reported @entity170 's plan on sunday			2
@entity170 has traveled to other @entity18 countries despite the @entity172 warrants against him for alleged war crimes and genocide in the @entity183 region , where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the @entity187 since 2003			0
@entity5 secretary - general @entity188 arrived sunday in @entity6 with a small delegation in advance of the summit			0
the agenda includes 10 central issues , the most important of which is @entity157 , @entity7 said			2
while the @entity5 has discussed @entity157 at numerous meetings in recent months , @entity7 said the summit will be " a golden opportunity for the @entity18 leaders to think together collectively " about the mounting crisis and stalemate			1
other issues include @entity202 , @entity203 , the @entity18 - @entity205 conflict , international terrorism and making the @entity14 free of weapons of mass destruction , @entity7 said			0
to prepare for the big event , ministries were allocated about $ 500 million for expenses including building and renovation of palaces , hotels , convention centers , and more , said @entity7			0
@entity6 municipality and other agencies have spent to cover costs related to the summit as well , he said			2
it is @entity1 's biggest challenge in many years , said @entity7 , pointing to the era under @entity223 when @entity1 was sanctioned and boycotted			2
" in fact , this country was isolated many years ago , " he said , adding that that 's why the summit " is a very , very important thing			0
" from @entity0 's @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , and @entity232			0

it could be called the @entity4 , foreign minister says
@entity1 has spent more than half a billion dollars to prepare
president @entity42 said people throughout the region will see " a new @entity1 "
the top issue at the summit will be @entity157 , @entity1 *diplomat* says
