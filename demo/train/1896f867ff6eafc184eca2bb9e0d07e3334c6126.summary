-- " an unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what i consider to be the minimum guarantee of the @entity6			0
" -- @entity10 @entity9 justice @entity8 , @entity11 vs. @entity12 , 1964 it 's downright disgusting to listen to conservative and @entity15 lawmakers , presidential candidates , business owners and media commentators use such vitriol to describe the @entity21 protesters as hell - bent on destroying @entity10			1
how in the world can anyone even form their lips to say such a thing when this very country was founded on the basis of dissent ? self - professed rodeo clown @entity31 castigates the @entity21 protesters , but he 's always running off at the mouth about the @entity34 and how brilliant they were			1
without dissent and protest , there is no @entity10 ! it 's as if these folks never picked up a history book to understand how this nation was formed			1
the very notion of a @entity10 started with someone saying , writing and screaming , " enough is enough ! " and when more and more of the early settlers became enraged at the heavy - handed actions of the @entity48 , that 's when we were on our path to the @entity51			1
do any of these so - called strict constructionists even read the very @entity10 @entity53 they love to wave in the faces of their critics ? every @entity10 , no matter if you 're young or old ; rich or poor ; red state or blue state ; @entity8 , white , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ; has the freedom to assemble and freedom of speech , which is at the heart of these protests			1
in this same space , i praised the tea party for not sitting around and complaining			0
instead , they organized and mobilized to affect the political discourse in the @entity15 and have definitely had their voices heard			0
i may disagree with a number of things the tea party advocates , but there is no way i would condemn them for doing it			0
as @entity9 @entity83 said , " the right to revolt has sources deep in our history			0
" it 's increasingly clear that some @entity10 love to talk a good game about protests , yet hate it when someone who opposes their views decides to stand up and be heard			1
remember all of those political voices championing the people of @entity97 taking to the streets to protest ? how about @entity99 ? @entity100 ? @entity101 ? @entity102 ? what would this world be without protest ? we would have never seen freedom in @entity108 were it not without the people there , in the words of civil rights activist @entity112 , being " sick and tired of being sick and tired			2
" praise @entity113 that the children of @entity116 , led by the @entity114 , did n't ignore the calls of history			0
if so , @entity119 would be dying in jail and freedom would have never ended apartheid			0
this nation would not have been forced to make real the very principles cited in the @entity124 , or treat every human being as an equal , were it not for the civil rights movement			0
those brave men , women and children chose not to accept the status quo , and this nation and the world are much better off because they did			0
as a supporter of @entity21 , i understand fully the sentiment that is being expressed			1
the massive corporate greed that has devastated the wages of the common worker , and seen the pay of a bunch on @entity141 go through the stratosphere for literally making nothing tangible , has been immoral and obscene			0
@entity141 and their protectors in @entity146 -- @entity147 and @entity15 -- say nothing is wrong with making a profit			0
but what is shameful and outlandish is to watch the @entity10 taxpayer save the jobs ( and big bonuses ) of these financial miscreants , only to see them jack up fees left and right			1
without the @entity10 people they would have had to pack up their belongings and hit the pavement			1
instead , they refuse to work with homeowners struggling to meet the big mortgage payments that @entity141 helped underwrite ; then sell in exotic transactions that wrecked this nation 's financial infrastructure			1
conservatives call this an assault on capitalism			1
no , @entity21 is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some			1
instead , what we have today are literal financial pirates trying to take the largest booty they can find			2
they do n't care about the long - term health of this country			0
it 's all about the next quarterly earnings reports and their massive year - end bonuses			2
this fight that occupy @entity141 is engaged in is nothing short of a battle for the soul of this nation			0
are we going to continue to allow ourselves to be held hostage by the big banks ? will we continue to allow them to trample over us with their " too big to fail " attitude ? no , no , and hell no. it 's time to bring these goliaths to their knees by any means necessary			2
that mean the young and righteous @entity200 must protest , march , sit - in , work the halls of @entity114 and state capitals nationwide , and make it clear that as long as @entity141 , its lobbyists and political protectors continue to mistreat the common man and woman , they are our mortal enemy			2
now is not the time to dismiss the protesters as a bunch of lefty college students with no guidance , no substance and no mission			2
instead of listening to politicians pimp the next generation , these folks are saying in the words of the founders of the nation 's first black newspaper , @entity223 : " we wish to plead our own cause ; too long have others spoken for us			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			1

without dissent and protest , there is no @entity10 , @entity229 says
*characterizing* @entity21 protesters as *anti-american* is disgusting , he says
@entity229 : it 's not an assault on capitalism , but a call for decency in in the financial industry
