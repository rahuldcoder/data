sitting cross-legged at her office desk , @entity0 expounds on what it means to be trapped in the wrong body			2
she is a 37 - year - old @entity5 -- a @entity7 term for male - to - female transgendered people			1
she appears at ease when she speaks about her sexual orientation and about the stereotypes associated with her community			1
@entity0 is relaxed because she 's in the confines of a non-profit workplace espousing the cause of sexual minorities like herself			1
here , she 's not judged by her deep voice or her masculine face , its lines softened by make - up , or by her feminine dresses , nail - polish and jewelry			1
@entity0 has gained a new found place in her country			2
@entity29 's @entity28 recently granted her and other transgendered people , status as a third gender			1
so , men can now be identified as females and females can be identified as males			2
but the outside world , she says , is harsh			2
in a largely conservative , family - structured region , proclaiming you are not what you are born could entail a harrowing ordeal that @entity0 suffered -- and survived			1
she raised a few eyebrows when she first slipped into her mother 's sari at the age of six			1
her cross-dressing habits , she remembers , were then ignored for some time			2
but her secret desire to break free from her anatomic sex would only become more intense as she grew older			2
" the issue about gender and sexuality kept coming back to me			1
but the unfortunate part of that was i did not have anybody to talk to ; i had no one to share my thoughts with , " @entity0 says			2
from rejection to acceptance @entity0 's self - discovery created a sense of loss for her widowed mother , for whom @entity0 was a boy			1
" my mother would take me to a temple and make me swear by @entity67 that i would change my behavior , " @entity0 said			2
" but it was beyond my control			0
" and @entity0 was rejected			0
her mother did n't speak with her for almost nine years			0
her teachers were n't supportive either			0
rather , she became a target of jeers			0
the hurt became deeper when she stepped into the adult world			0
her lovers , she says , also abandoned her			0
" my journey was lonely			0
all my lovers rejected me			0
they either used me for money , or for sexual pleasure or for some momentary emotional support			0
there was a huge vacuum , " she says , her voice thick with emotion			0
that 's when , she says , she set off on a journey for acceptance within the @entity5 community			1
and as is the protocol , the initiation into the fold required her to pursue a hijra " guru " or a mentor , which she did			0
she also underwent a long , drawn - out feminization process			1
the reward , she says , was priceless : liberation			0
in contrast to @entity0 , opportunities for employment are extremely limited for most members of the @entity5 community			1
many end up in prostitution and begging on streets , she says			1
at a 45 - minute drive from her office , a cramped , three - storied building along an unpaved road serves as a multi-purpose center for transgender and gay people			1
volunteers walk up and down its dusty , unplastered stairs for an @entity118 counseling session on the first floor			1
according to the @entity29 government , the country 's transgender community is seen as disproportionately vulnerable to the deadly infection despite its tiny size			1
a portion of a dimly lit room segregated by makeshift partitions is then used as a practice hall for the young @entity5 members to hone their skills in dancing			0
in today 's wired world , they do n't have to outsource professional instrument players			1
instead , it 's just a case of hooking a set of speakers into a mobile phone before setting off , dancing and lip - syncing to popular @entity142 songs			1
but beneath the joyous mood , despair lurks			0
many @entity145 at this center are at least 10 years younger than @entity0			0
they say they , too , faced tough social resistance to their choice to reject gender binarism			1
@entity150 , 27 , says her family thought she was under the influence of black magic when she starting cross-dressing and applying cosmetic powder to her eyes			0
she suppressed her true nature for a while			0
" i had to wear male outfits although i did n't feel comfortable , " @entity150 says			0
her brother , she says , was more rigid than others			0
" there was a deadline for me to be home at 8 pm every day			0
" but as transgender issues attracted more attention , she used the increased media focus to explain to her family she 's not the only one			1
" eventually , there was some understanding			0
thankfully , i do n't have to retreat into my biological sexual appearance now when i am home , " says @entity150 , who aims to become a make - up artist			1
equal rights for transgender and gay people within a span of few months , @entity29 's @entity28 has come out with what activists say are conflicting judgments , on transgenders and @entity145 on one hand , and the gay community on the other			1
this month , the justices granted @entity187 the right to self - identify their gender in what has been hailed as a historic ruling to end centuries - old discrimination against the country 's transgender citizens			1
in december 2013 though , the same top court re-criminalized consensual homosexual relationships , reinstating a colonial - era law banning people from engaging in " carnal acts against the order of nature			2
" known as @entity202 , that law was initially struck down in 2009 by a high court in @entity205 but its reinstatement has led to fears for gay people in the country			2
many of them came out in the open about their relationships when @entity202 was thrown out in 2009			0
image consultant @entity213 , who is gay , is now apprehensive			2
" what happens to those teenagers and those young people who came out of the closet thinking that ' my country is on my side , the court is on my side and my parents ca n't throw me out ' ? " he asks			0
the anti-gay law and its revival , he feels , violate personal freedoms in a diverse democracy			0
" how can you take away something which is integrally my right -- what happens behind closed doors in my bedroom -- and judge me for that ? ( to ) call me a criminal for making love ? it 's just silly			2
