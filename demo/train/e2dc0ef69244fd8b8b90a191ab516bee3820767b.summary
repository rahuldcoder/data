-- the tiny @entity2 nation of @entity3 is more often associated with its unforgiving hurricane season and at times turbulent political history , however this week the island will be hoping that all the conditions are right for sailing			1
the 2012 @entity9 begins on friday with races around the southern and eastern coasts , in waters the organizers say are some of the most challenging in the @entity2			1
it is that same water that attracts visitors to the region			1
the crystal blue sea is a haven for sailors , swimmers and scuba divers , keen to race , relax and explore in the island that is known for being a yachting destination			1
twenty one miles long and 12 miles wide , @entity3 lies just north of @entity25			1
the island declared independence from @entity28 in 1974 , and today , much of its culture reflects the @entity31 roots of the black majority			1
@entity3 is more commonly known as the " @entity33 " and is a major exporter of cinnamon and nutmeg			1
climate around 110 , 000 people call @entity3 home , with the largest town @entity41 's having one of the @entity2 's most picturesque waterfronts			1
with the average temperatures teetering around the mid-to late 20s ( degrees ) , the climate is perfect to enjoy the outdoors and gaze out towards the ocean			2
however the region is not immune to hurricanes			2
its long hurricane season , stretching from june until november , can sometimes be deadly			2
in 2004 , @entity52 ripped through the area , killing dozens in the region and causing widespread damage			2
sailing if the festival inspires yachting enthusiasts to set sail , then there are plenty of marinas and inlets to dock for overnight stays			2
eight marinas are dotted around the @entity3 , and little inlets offer boats a sheltered place to drop an anchor			2
the festival centers around @entity71 , just outside the capital			2
@entity73 , a photographer who lives on the island said , " society here is n't based on class or cash - flow - and those lack of barriers is openly evident during the sailing festival			0
million dollar sailing yachts are crewed by visitors and locals alike			0
" on any given vessel you might find a teacher , a doctor , an investment banker , or a leather - skinned yachtie who travels from festival to festival			0
" diving the crystal clear water of @entity3 makes the island 's surrounds ideal for diving			1
reefs , shipwrecks and a sculpture park are features of the underwater world			0

but it 's not just the natural beauty that 's said to captivate			0
the @entity117 shipwreck has been called the ' @entity118 '			0
the luxury liner sank outside the capital 's harbor more than half a century ago and has since become a spectacular dive site			0
the sculptures under the sea is another of the breathtaking man - made sites			1
they were created by renowned @entity128 artist @entity127 to promote conservation awareness			0
beaches undoubtedly a highlight of @entity3 , people are divided as to which beach is the best			0
but one thing they do agree on is that with turquoise water the glides up the long stretches of white sand , the beaches are idyllic			0
visitors who are hungry for the typical @entity3 experience should head to @entity143 where bars and restaurants are sandwiched between the clear waters and surrounding hills			1
@entity148 : making the most of @entity151 's ' harbor city ' the fashion conscious should try the beach resort of @entity154 which is co-owned by an @entity156 fashion publicist			0
