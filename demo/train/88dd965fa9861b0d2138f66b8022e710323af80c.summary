a statement on its website read : " attacks by oceanic white tip sharks are extremely rare and shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the @entity31			1
" if you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the @entity31 resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably			0
" a basic rule is never to dive or snorkel unaccompanied			0
where possible make any bookings through your tour representative			0
" unusually cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards			0
" tour operators @entity47 and @entity49 also warned holiday - makers about the shark attacks			1
" we are treating the situation very seriously and are advising all of our customers not to swim in the sea at @entity12 , " a statement said			0
" we have also cancelled all water - based excursions until further notice			0
" after the attacks authorities ordered people to stay out of the water around @entity12			2
on thursday , the @entity62 said two sharks suspected of the maulings were caught			1
@entity65 , general operations manager of the @entity66 in @entity12 , said employees at the @entity69 resort told him the attack happened about noon ( 5 a.m. et ) in a protected swim area off the resort			1
@entity65 has three dive - instruction operations in the area , including one at the @entity69			0
the 70 - year - old woman , a regular guest at the resort , was snorkeling near a reef when she was attacked , he said			1
she called for help , and a lifeguard brought her to shore , but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed , @entity65 said			0
the woman 's arm and leg were severed , he said			1
a @entity21 tourist described witnessing one of the shark attacks			1
@entity89 , 31 , of @entity90 , @entity91 , told @entity93 newspaper : " the water was churning like i was in a washing machine			0
i was being thrown around in the blood			0
" after the sunday incident , the @entity97 called on its members in the region " to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore			2
" the chamber is under the umbrella of the @entity106			0
@entity65 said all tourists were ordered to stay out of the water at least through monday			1

on friday , two sharks were caught and killed near the @entity114 on the @entity12 coast , according to the @entity97			1
the chamber said that as of friday , the condition of three injured snorkelers -- two @entity120 women and a man from the @entity122 -- were unchanged			2
one of them was critical , the chamber said in a statement , but did not say which one			0
the three were attacked in a 24 - hour period november 30 and december 1 , the chamber said			0
@entity65 said he is not a marine biologist , but many have speculated an oceanic white - tipped shark was responsible for the @entity9 woman 's death , as well as the other attacks			1
divers are upset because the two sharks killed friday are thought to be innocent			2
they were a mako shark and another oceanic white - tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers , he said			1
officials at the national park did not provide details on " why the animals could not be relocated to remote waters as was previously suggested , " the chamber 's statement said , adding it " does not wish to see any harm to any further sharks			1
" exploratory dives were taking place on friday , @entity65 said			0
officials are not sure what triggered the feeding behavior , described as highly unusual			0
" this incident has clearly shocked our community , and the @entity159 is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened , " @entity155 , head of the @entity97 , said in the statement			0
" it is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic white tip shark was triggered by an activity , most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area			2
" several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week , @entity65 said			0
it 's not known how they got there , he said , but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat			2
the shark may have been attracted by the carcass , he said , and could now be attacking slow - moving things on the water 's surface			2
