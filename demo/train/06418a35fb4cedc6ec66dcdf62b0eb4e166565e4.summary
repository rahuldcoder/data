-- after churning through the @entity2 and chugging up the @entity3 , @entity1 made landfall over southeastern @entity5 on tuesday night -- bringing with it sustained winds of 80 mph and torrential , stinging rains			1
according to the @entity12 , the storm 's center moved over land in @entity14 at 6:45 p.m. ( 7:45 p.m. et ) -- one day before the seventh anniversary of @entity16 , which left nearly 1,800 dead and caused billions of dollars worth of damage along the @entity18			1
@entity1 's eye then " wobbled westward " and moved back over @entity3 waters , and by 10 p.m. @entity21 was centered about 75 miles southeast of @entity22 , @entity5 -- all while keeping its strength as it lashed those onshore			1
throughout the night , the hurricane center issued advisories indicating that steady hurricane - force winds of 74 mph and stronger were being felt 60 miles out , mostly to the east and northeast of @entity1 's eye			1
sporadic gusts were even stronger , including a 106 mph wind reading from high up on an oil rig off the southeast @entity5 coast and 85 mph in @entity34 , @entity5			1
while @entity1 is expected to eventually lose steam , that might not happen immediately because much of the sprawling storm will be over water for several more hours			1
how to prepare for a storm even with more dangerous conditions likely yet to come , the storm already has caused significant surges and flooding in a number of locales , and not just those directly in @entity1 's path			1
storm surges of 10.3 feet have been reported in @entity48 just outside @entity49 , and 6.7 feet in @entity50 , @entity51 , according to the hurricane center			1
these surges likely will get worse , with forecasters predicting water levels to rise between 6 to 12 feet on the coast in @entity51 and southeastern @entity5 alone			1
@entity51 state authorities have noted that waters have gone up around the state faster than expected , something @entity56 noticed as he surveyed the @entity61 in @entity62			0
he estimated tuesday afternoon that this river was 6 to 8 feet higher than normal , and at low tide , expressing concerns about even more flooding during high tide wednesday morning			2
" the fact that we have n't had any rain and that we 've got six to eight hours before the real fun begins ... makes me nervous , " echoed @entity68 , another @entity0 ireporter who documented flooding in nearby @entity72			2
a large swath of the northern @entity18 on tuesday night was experiencing tropical storm conditions , with winds in excess of 39 mph , including parts of @entity51 and @entity83 , the hurricane center reported			1
intense rains alone could cause major headaches , and flooding , given @entity1 's slow progression			1
having at one point swept through the @entity2 at 21 mph , @entity1 's movement slowed tuesday to 8 mph			1
it continued creeping northwest at this speed through tuesday night			0
because @entity1 is moving at such a slow clip , @entity0 meteorologist @entity92 estimated some residents could experience hurricane or tropical storm conditions for between 24 and 36 hours before the storm finally moves on			1
while residents had been feeling its effects for hours , the storm 's eye was still 75 miles south - southeast of @entity49 at 10 p.m. tuesday			1
by then , heavy rain had already contributed to significant flooding , including " deceptively deep " water under @entity104 at @entity105			0
but due to the strong winds , barriers aimed at keeping drivers away flailed in the wind			0
" please help us spread word : @entity112 at @entity105 is flooded			0
we can not keep up barricades b / c of wind			0
do not try to cross , " the city said via @entity115			0
mayor @entity116 said he expected the worst of the storm to hit his city wednesday morning , bringing with it hurricane - force winds and between 10 and 16 inches of rain			1
the mayor wrote on @entity115 that about 1,000 @entity124 troops and more than 2,900 law enforcement officers are in the city ready to address issues related to the storm			2
" we 're in a hunker down phase now , because this storm could be over us for a while with a lot of wind and rain , " @entity116 said in a statement			0
" @entity133 means hunker down and prepare to ride it out			0
" keep a hurricane preparation checklist like @entity116 and other local and state authorities , president @entity137 on tuesday had urged those in @entity1 's path to listen to authorities and stay safe			1
" now 's not the time to tempt fate , " he said from @entity142 , after signing an emergency declaration for the state of @entity51 like he had for @entity5 a day earlier			1
" now 's not the time to dismiss official warnings			0
you need to take this seriously			0
" besides strong winds , @entity1 could bring 14 inches of total rainfall in many places , and isolated parts of southeast @entity5 , southern @entity51 , southern @entity83 and the @entity156 could get as much as 20 inches , the hurricane center said			1
entering tuesday , @entity18 residents braced for the worst from a storm that has already caused considerable devastation as it headed north from the @entity2			0
@entity161 's civil protection agency reported at least 19 people in that country died due to @entity1 , which after hitting that impoverished nation went on to lash @entity165 and the @entity166			1
weathering the storm : links , tips and resources @entity170 , a @entity171 from @entity172 on @entity156 's east coast , reported that floodwater there is " almost waist deep at some ... points			1
" " all we can do is wait for the water to recede , " she said			0
the hurricane 's " increasing winds and seas " disrupted a search for a missing man on tuesday , @entity179 spokesman @entity179 said			2
the @entity185 had been looking off the coast of @entity187 , @entity156 , for a " missing jet skier " whose wife reported him missing monday night			0
@entity179 said that rescue crews would " temporarily suspend their search efforts until the storm passes and weather conditions become safe enough			0
" @entity1 : state by state @entity1 's impact has been felt , and seen , in other ways as well -- including bending trees , drenching roads and knocking down power lines			1
@entity203 , one of many utilities affected by the storm , reported around 222,000 customers without power statewide at 10:12 p.m. ct			1
@entity1 earlier prompted three airports to close -- in @entity49 ; @entity62 , @entity51 ; and @entity209 , @entity83 -- and cancellations of around 1,500 flights systemwide , according to airline and airport officials			1
in addition , the @entity185 announced it has closed major ports along the @entity18 and the @entity217 from @entity218 to its mouth because of the storm			0
business in many of the most affected areas came to a standstill because of @entity1			2
for example , 52 @entity227 and @entity228 stores in @entity5 and nine in @entity51 had shut down by 5:30 p.m. tuesday , their parent company said			2
@entity231 suspended its train service to and from @entity49 on tuesday and wednesday because of @entity1			1
and residents of @entity14 , located along the @entity3 , are subject to a " dusk - to - dawn curfew " because of @entity1 , parish officials said			2
in and around @entity49 , authorities closed a number of flood protection structures			2
these included the @entity240 -- one of the world 's largest pump stations , capable of pumping stormwater at 20,000 cubic feet per second -- said the @entity245			2
" there is no evidence of any ( water ) overtopping ( canals ) , " @entity116 said tuesday evening			0
" we have full confidence the levees will hold			0
" in @entity51 , more than 1,800 evacuees were staying in 33 shelters located in 16 counties as of 9 p.m. tuesday , according to the state 's emergency management agency			0
more than 80,000 sandbags were given out earlier in the day , and several popular @entity62 casinos closed temporarily			0
disaster dining : stay safe and stay fed shrimpers in @entity262 , @entity83 , were among those who heeded official warnings and hunkered down			0
" all the boats are coming			0
we 're anchoring them down and getting ready for this blow , hoping it 's not too bad , " @entity266 , the owner of @entity267 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity268 in @entity262			0
the @entity274 on tuesday said it was sending additional inspectors to two @entity5 nuclear plants in the storm 's path , as power company @entity203 planned a " controlled shutdown " of one of them starting tuesday afternoon			1
@entity1 is not expected to be as strong as @entity16 , which made landfall as a category 3 storm with 125 mph winds			2
even so , the head of @entity287 stressed tuesday that wind speed is n't the only factor to consider when assessing how much damage a storm might cause			2
" i know there are a lot of jaded folks on the coast that have been through @entity297 and then @entity16 and think , well , this is just a category 1 hurricane , " said @entity287 director @entity292 from @entity51			0
" the tendency to look at the category of the wind speed does n't always tell the story of what the impacts will be			0
" @entity304 share @entity1 photos , videos @entity18 authorities and residents are praying there will be no repeat of the devastation the 2005 hurricane caused after protective levees around @entity49 failed and flooded the city			1
col. @entity315 of the @entity245 vowed that the system now in place " is the best ... the greater @entity49 area has ever seen			2
" @entity319 , for one , trusts that the levees will hold this time			0
the @entity48 , @entity5 , resident , who rebuilt her home after @entity16 , said her family will wait @entity1 out -- though they have a generator and life jackets , " just in case			1
" " i do n't know if it 's going to be a true test , because they 're saying it 's not going to be that bad , " @entity319 said			2
" but you never know what bad is			0
we did n't think @entity16 was going to be bad either			0
" share your photos and videos of @entity1 on @entity339 @entity0 's @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 and @entity351 contributed to this report .			2
