, " singer / actress @entity8 and her mother , @entity9 , radiate an empowered sophistication			1
their pose eschews the @entity19 © embrace			0
instead they strike a stance of support -- mother and daughter @entity25 , arms hooked			1
the book intertwines their two stories , how each has struggled on her own and how the complicated relationship that binds them still supplies a safety net			1
from public scandal -- she stepped down as the first black @entity35 after nude photos of her appeared in @entity37 -- to @entity39 triumph , @entity8 has been on the celebrity radar for decades			1
through it all , her mother has been a touchstone of humor and support in good times and bad			2
@entity0 sat down with both women to discuss their book , their parenting revelations and their memories from a lifetime in the spotlight			1
the following is an edited transcript of the conversation			0
@entity0 : how has your relationship evolved over time ? @entity9 : well , as @entity8 has grown into womanhood and become a mother , it 's a more adult - to - adult relationship now , rather than the domineering mom , as they tend to think i was , to a more relaxed relationship but understanding that i 'm still a mother in the relationship			1
@entity8 : as a mother now of four children , i can see her much more wholly as a woman , a mother , someone who has had a past and someone whose past has influenced her choices as well as mine			1
the wiser you get , the more experience you have , and the more you see people for who they are as human beings , as opposed to figures you have to fight against			2
i think i am much more conscious of back story , temperament and even going through perimenopause and how it can affect your mood , attitude and relations and how you deal with people			2
there are a lot of things that you do n't realize that your parents are going through when you 're a kid			2
@entity0 : how did you ' survive ' all of that together ? @entity9 : ( her father and i ) were the support that we felt she needed to survive some of the things that she had to deal with that were not always the positive things			1
and we were also the supporters when something really exciting happened , like when she had her first @entity39 show			0
@entity8 : and it 's never - ending , especially in this business			1
you 're always going to have people that are naysayers , that do n't believe in your talent , that do n't believe that you have any kind of longevity			1
i am happy to be able to look back -- because the book is called " you have no idea , " and every time there has been a major triumph in my career , nobody ever expected it			2
on @entity39 : " i did n't know she could sing and dance			0
" a no. 1 hit on the radio : " i had no idea that she could be a recording artist			0
" with " @entity125 " and three emmy nominations : " i had no idea she was funny			0
" it is always redefining who you are and raging against the machine			0
@entity0 : what do you think mothers and daughters will take away from this book ? @entity8 : i hope that they see that it 's not all peaches and cream			1
even when we shot the cover -- they had shown me the cover of @entity145 ' book with her mom , and it was warm , loving and toasty , and they are embracing each other			2
and i said , " that 's not us ! " in the back of the book , you see me crowning her , because she is the real queen in our family			2
and so there is a sense of humor , which is part of our dynamic , and that 's how we get through lots of things in our life			0
@entity9 : what i hope they take away is it 's an honest story of two experiences , two different people with two different personalities , and how we were able to respect our roles as a mother and daughter and tell the story that worked for us with support , love , caring and being there for your child			1
@entity0 : what did you want for @entity8 ? @entity9 : we wanted her to be whatever she chose to be as her life goal			1
to support her , doing whatever we could to make it happen			0
to be a happy , successful person			0
@entity8 : i also think , had i not been talented in the arts and i still wanted to be in it , they would have said " why do n't you do something else ? " luckily they saw my talent and my interest in it and they gave me all the gifts to allow me to take dance class , piano and @entity200 horn and be in theater and major in musical theater in college , rather than saying , " why do n't you do something normal ? " or " get a real job			1
" i never heard that			0
@entity0 : as a mother now , do you hear yourself saying things that sound like your mother ? @entity8 : when i heard it loud and clear was when i was on location shooting a show called " @entity215			1
" i was on the phone with my 11 - year - old daughter			0
she started with violin , played piano and percussion , then she wanted to switch to the trumpet , and then wanted to drop it altogether			0
i remember saying , " we do n't drop our instruments in this family			0
everyone takes an instrument until they graduate , and that 's what we do as a family , so you 've got to figure out if it 's violin or trumpet or something else			2
and i do n't ever want to hear the music teacher telling me you 're not showing up again			2
" and that 's when i knew , i am the same parent , i have heard this before			0
@entity0 : how would each of you describe that relationship between mother and daughter ? @entity8 : i am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different			1
i look at my daughters and i have different relationships with all three and there are parts of each personality that are very special			0
i rely on them for their particular qualities , but i feel happy that i have three completely different opportunities to make my mommy - daughter relationship different			2
@entity9 : and mine was such trial and error before @entity8 was born			1
i had no skills in diaper changing or feeding or any of the things that you 're required to do as a mother			1
i enjoyed having a girl -- the mother - daughter shopping , dressing up and doing those things together			2
there 'll be difficult times , especially when girls start growing up , and it 's not easy , but you get through it			0
you just have to be patient and give them their space and recognize who they are			0
@entity0 : is there a moment between you two that stands out as unforgettable ? @entity9 : for me , it was when @entity8 had performed " @entity285 " on @entity39 , because we knew that was one of the things that she wanted to do her entire life			1
her high school picture said " i 'll see you on @entity39			0
" it was something that she 'd worked very hard toward			0
she had some people that did not want her to be on @entity39 , and she persisted			0
@entity8 : i think one of my mother - daughter memories was at the first state dinner that i attended , when president @entity294 invited me to the @entity295 that october as @entity35 , and my mother said , " whatever you do , get the president to sign the menu ! " i ended up sitting at his table and trying to think , how am i going to get through this dinner with the president and get him to sign my menu ? i listened to him talk about his life in @entity13 and towards the end , i said " can you please sign this menu for my mother ? she will kill me otherwise			1
" and he very politely did it , and she still has it			0
the things that you do for your mother ! @entity9 : but they 're important things .			1
