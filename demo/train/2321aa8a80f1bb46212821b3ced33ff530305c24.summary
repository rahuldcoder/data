please , mr. president , do n't leave me behind			0
that 's the gist of former @entity5 subcontractor @entity4 ' plea to president @entity6 in a letter on the fourth anniversary of @entity4 ' imprisonment in a small military prison cell in @entity11			1
in the letter , @entity4 , convicted by a @entity11 court of " acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state , " says he spends 23 hours a day in a small cell with two other inmates , is in poor health and is largely cut off from the outside world			1
" with the utmost respect , mr. president , i fear that my government -- the very government i was serving when i began this nightmare -- has abandoned me , " wrote @entity4 , a former subcontractor for the @entity23			1
" officials in your administration have expressed sympathy and called for my unconditional release , and i very much appreciate that			0
but it has not brought me home			0
" his wife , @entity34 , told @entity40 's " @entity38 with @entity39 " that she 's fed up with apparently empty promises from government officials who have said they 'll help			2
... it causes me a lot of anger			0
i have to say right now i 'm angry at the @entity5 government			1
i 'm angry at the @entity11 government , " she said tuesday			1
" i 'm totally frustrated for this lack of action , that @entity4 is still in the same situation that he was four years ago			1
" @entity11 authorities arrested @entity4 in 2009 , holding him for more than a year before formally accusing him of illegally distributing prohibited satellite communications equipment to @entity11 dissidents			1
after a brief trial in 2011 , he was sentenced to 15 years in prison			0
according to @entity23 , @entity4 was in the country to work on a @entity5 government - funded project to set up individual satellite - based @entity61 connections in @entity11			1
his family has said he was working to help @entity65 groups set up web access			0
despite saying that it plans to provide @entity11 with internet access , the country 's government restricts the ability of everyday citizens to access the @entity72			2
the @entity73 did not immediately comment on @entity4 ' letter , but secretary of state @entity75 said tuesday in @entity76 that the administration is " currently engaged in some discussions " regarding @entity4 ' imprisonment			1
he said he was not at liberty to go into any detail			0
" we will do everything we can and will continue to , but these things are often best resolved in quiet diplomacy , under the radar screen , behind the scenes , and that is exactly what we have been pursuing			0
" numerous @entity5 representatives have tried to bargain for the former contractor 's release , including former @entity94 gov. @entity93 and former president @entity95 , but to no avail			1
on monday , the @entity97 released a statement calling @entity4 ' continued imprisonment " gravely disappointing			2
" " mr. @entity4 is a 64 - year - old husband , father , and dedicated professional with a long history of providing aid to underserved communities in more than 50 countries , " the @entity97 said			2
" we reiterate our call on the @entity11 government , echoing foreign leaders and even @entity11 's allies , to release @entity4 immediately and unconditionally			1
" @entity34 said tuesday that assurances from @entity75 that discussions are ongoing are n't enough			1
" this is something that i 've heard for four years			0
i do n't know what that means , ' doing something			0
' we have not been told what they 're doing , " she said			0
" so at this point we feel that we have to step it up a notch , and we are asking president @entity6 to get personally involved in the situation and do what needs to be done to get him out			1
" @entity6 , she said , has the power to jump start the process and give @entity11 officials what they 've repeatedly told her they want : a chance to talk with an envoy from the @entity5 government			1
" i want @entity6 to take @entity4 seriously , to take the situation seriously , " she said			1
" he 's the leader of the nation			0
he 's the one that could go to the @entity97 , go to the @entity140 and say , ' let 's make this work			0
' he could do this tomorrow if he wanted to			0
" how can you improve any situation without sitting down and talking ? it just does n't work that way , " she said			0
at a rally across from the @entity73 on tuesday , she said @entity5 calls for her husband 's " unconditional " surrender would amount to a " death sentence " for her husband , intimating that the @entity5 will need to bargain with @entity11 for her husband 's release			1
" he tries so hard to hold on to hope , but it is fading fast , " she told protesters			0
@entity4 ' family says that he has lost nearly 100 pounds , has developed degenerative arthritis in his leg and has battled depression since his arrest			2
in a statement read to demonstrators on tuesday , @entity4 said his treatment at the prison is " stressfully demeaning and my environment is oppressive			2
" he does not speak @entity169 and so can not communicate with his guards or the other two inmates jailed with him , @entity4 said in the statement			2
@entity4 says he is allowed out of his cell for one hour a day , which he spends in a small courtyard with high walls and limited views of the sky and nothing else			2
" i do n't sleep much , between my arthritis and the lights in my cell , which are kept on 24 hours a day			0
with the exception of a few phone calls and visits , i am completely isolated from the outside world , " he wrote			0
" i have lost almost everything in the last four years , most of all time with my family -- my wife , @entity34 , and my daughters , @entity193 and @entity194			0
i have had to ask my daughters not to visit because i can not bear them seeing me like this , a shadow of my former self , surrounded by men with machine guns , " he said in his letter to @entity6			2
" my heart is broken from acute homesickness , loneliness and disappointment from my government , " @entity4 said in his statement to protesters			2
@entity4 , a longtime international development worker , said he was pleading for his release not only for his own benefit and that of his family but also for all @entity5 working , living or traveling abroad			1
" there are countless @entity5 all over the world , some serving in uniform , others serving in diplomatic or civilian capacities , still others private citizens studying or traveling abroad , and they must not harbor any doubt that if they are taken captive in a foreign land , our government will move heaven and earth to secure their freedom , " @entity4 wrote .			1

" i 'm angry at the @entity5 government , " @entity4 ' wife says
" we are asking president @entity6 to get personally involved , " she says
secretary of state @entity75 says discussions on @entity4 ' release are ongoing
