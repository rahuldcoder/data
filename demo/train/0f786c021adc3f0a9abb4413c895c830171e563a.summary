-- it was n't the sight of tortured bodies that scared " @entity4			2
" it was what was written on the sign that was left next to them			2
" this will happen to all the @entity11 snitches			2
" it was signed by @entity13			2
the banner was placed next to the two victims , a woman and man , both in their 20s , both gruesomely killed			2
the woman was disemboweled , left with her intestines protruding from her belly			2
they were found in september 2011 , hanging from a bridge in @entity24 , @entity25 , robbed of any future dignity			1
about three hours away in @entity28 , @entity4 's stomach grumbled when he saw the banner on the @entity11			2
" those people hanging from the bridge could have been me , " he thought			2
@entity25 : a deadly beat for the past two years , @entity4 has taken to @entity33 to act as a tipster to cartel activity in his town			1
when local and state authorities tried to downplay news about the cartels operating in the northern @entity25 state of @entity41 ( at one point the government attributed the tension to the " psychosis of the residents " ) @entity4 was one of the first people on social media to tip the world about what was really happening			1
his news of " narco blockades " and gun fights throughout @entity28 in late february 2010 was among the first news people received about the fresh war that erupted between @entity13 and the @entity57 cartel			1
he has become such a trustworthy source of information that the social media savvy residents of @entity28 head to his account to find what places to avoid before leaving their homes			1
others trapped in the street after gunfights look to him to offer alternate ways to get home			2
his account has become both a tool of information and survival			1
he asked @entity0 not to use his name to protect his identity			1
" during an attack , the network goes beyond @entity33			1
people on the street send me an sms alert , a radio alert or a phone call to let me know what 's going on , " @entity4 says of his role of protecting @entity28 's innocent			2
" we continue to report after the attack to cover the information gap by the local press			1
" thanks to @entity33 we have documentation , with video , audio and images , of violent events , " he says			1
" it 's a registration [ countering the ] opacity and denial of local and state government			1
" many people have trusted me and i appreciate it , " he says			2
" it 's very rewarding and a great responsibility that motivates me to make sure i use @entity33 properly ... as a tool of social utility			1
" @entity4 is well aware of his responsibility			2
the short description on his @entity33 account makes that clear , " a society [ that is ] selfish , apathetic , indifferent has no moral authority , it is more comfortable complaining , blaming , criticizing than participating [ to ] contribute , [ to ] build ... " inspired in part by the " @entity110 " in @entity111 , @entity25 citizens became increasingly active on the social media site in 2010 as a way to combat the drug violence infesting their cities			1
lacking confidence in their local authorities , they took @entity33 to " spread truth , " denounce cartels and warn each other of shootouts			1
on @entity123 , a video titled " @entity33 " gives guidance on how to create anonymous @entity33 accounts so users can announce where cartels are operating			1
it gives examples of how to circulate information to a wider audience by using hashtags and how to direct tweets to legitimate journalists on @entity33			1
in some cities of @entity25 -- especially in the northern part of the country -- cartels have used violence and intimidation to control swaths of land and smuggling routes in their unquenchable quest for money and power			1
their assault on @entity25 bloggers seemingly takes aim at controlling cyberspace as well			1
for many within the blogging community the development comes as no surprise			2
some were even anticipating it			0
@entity4 was n't always so plugged in			0
before the cartels used his town as their battlefield , he spent the majority of his days at work			0
born into a family of traders in @entity162 , he moved to @entity28 a few years ago to follow his passion and open up his own store			0
he would use the internet sparingly , most of the time to play games or stay in touch with friends back home in the capital			0
he has always been low key , passing the time at weekend carne asadas with friends or going to the movies			0
life is radically different now			0
" i avoid the street at night , " he says of the unofficial curfew local residents adhere to in @entity28			1
he speaks in a hushed tone , choosing his words carefully before delivering them			0
his voice is delicate , but soaked in concern			0
" if you go to a party , you sleep there			0
if not , you might suffer an attack by armed civilians if you come across the wrong people on your way home			0
" in @entity28 , the bad guys are n't always so easily recognizable			0
@entity4 says most residents are suspicious of the public security forces			0
" they will , under any pretext , extort you , " he says of the authorities			0
about a year ago the hashtags frequented by @entity4 were saturated with tweets about his confrontation with the local police			1
his friends messaged the media , asking for news outlets to cover the assault			1
they cited it as a microcosm for what everyday residents go through			0
when asked by @entity0 what happened , @entity4 downplayed the incident , saying instead it 's what to be expected " in the environment of corruption and war			0
" " they roughed me up outside of my store ... the police are the more visible arm of the local cartel , " he says , as if asked to state the obvious			1
" when asked about the specific allegations of corruption , @entity0 was referred by local authorities to the @entity41 attorney general 's office			1
after repeated requests for an interview , @entity0 did not receive a response			0
in past interviews conducted by @entity0 with attorney general 's spokesman @entity235 , similar allegations of abuse among local and state officials were denied			1
@entity4 says the incident with the police was the only " direct threat " he 's received			0
but in a part of the world where talking about threats is enough to get you killed , it 's no surprise he is shy when the subject comes up			0
" i think there is a real risk [ to my life ] " , he says			0
" sometimes you get that feeling , so you have to maintain a low profile			0
in @entity28 , one slip - up can cost a lot			0
it 's not a place where people feel comfortable asking the police for help staying safe , " he says			0
as for those who are trying to keep people like him silent , @entity262 addresses it with indignation			0
his defiance is clear with every tweet he sends			0
" they try to silence the voice of citizens with their organization through fear , terror , " he says			2
" obviously what we do affects the interests of the cartel and local government			1
but the citizens have found a way to organize and protect each other on @entity33			1
the police and authorities ... they do n't care			0
so you find a way take care of them			0

some local news outlets downplay @entity25 cartel violence
but social media has helped fill that information void
