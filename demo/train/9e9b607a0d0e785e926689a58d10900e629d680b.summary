we 've got some great other young governors			0
i think you 're going to see the governors assume a greater leadership role in our @entity19 , " he said			1
he then mentioned governors @entity22 of @entity23 and @entity24 of @entity25			0
@entity1 said he has " the greatest appreciation for @entity4 and her family , and it was a great joy to know them			1
" " she invigorated our campaign " against @entity31 for the presidency , he said			2
@entity1 was pressed on why he ca n't promise support for the woman who , just months ago , he named as the second best person to lead the nation			2
" have no doubt of my admiration and respect for her and my view of her viability , but at this stage , again ... my corpse is still warm , you know ? " he replied			0
in his first sunday political tv appearance since november 4 , @entity1 also promised to work to build consensus in tackling @entity49 's challenges , and criticized his own party for its latest attack on @entity31			1
@entity1 rejected complaints from the @entity53 that @entity31 has not been transparent about his contacts with @entity56 gov. @entity55			1
" i think that the @entity31 campaign should and will give all information necessary , " @entity1 told @entity7 's " @entity6			1
" " you know , in all due respect to the @entity53 and anybody -- right now , i think we should try to be working constructively together , not only on an issue such as this , but on the economy , stimulus package , reforms that are necessary			0
" @entity1 's answer came in response to a question about comments from @entity53 chairman @entity72			1
the @entity53 also released an internet ad last week , titled " questions remain , " suggesting @entity31 is failing to provide important information about potential links between his associates and @entity55			2
@entity55 was arrested tuesday and charged with trying to trade @entity31 's @entity79 seat for campaign contributions and other favors			1

" but i have some confidence that all the information will come out			0
it always does , it seems to me			0
" @entity1 said he , like @entity31 and many other lawmakers , believes @entity55 should resign			1

" i think my job is , of course , to be a part of , and hopefully exert some leadership , in the loyal opposition			0
but i emphasize the word loyal , " @entity1 said			2
" we have n't seen economic times like this in my lifetime			0
we have n't seen challenges abroad at the level that we are experiencing , certainly since the end of the @entity112 , and you could argue in some respects that they 're certainly more complex , many of these challenges			0
so let 's have our first priority where we can work together ... " will there be areas of disagreement ? of course			2
we are different parties and different philosophy			0
but the nation wants us to unite and work together			0
" @entity1 said he would n't comment on whether he thought he had a good chance of winning the presidency , given the @entity127 administration and the @entity19 were perceived to be responsible for the economy 's problems			1
@entity1 said he would " leave that question " for others " to make that kind of judgment			2
" he pointed out that his poll numbers dropped along with the @entity135			0
" that would sound like i am detracting from president - elect @entity31 's campaign			1
i do n't want to do that ... nobody likes a sore loser			0
" the key to moving past the stinging defeat , he said , is to , " get busy and move on			0
that 's the best cure for it			2
i spent a period of time feeling sorry for myself			0
it 's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have			2
" but the point is : you 've got to move on ... i 'm still a senator from the state of @entity152			1
i still have the privilege and honor of serving this country , which i 've done all my life , and it 's a great honor to do so			0
