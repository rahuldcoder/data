@entity0 -- @entity2 has said all along that a court would convict him			1
not because he 's guilty , but because it would prevent him from running for mayor of @entity0			1
on thursday , a @entity7 court did just that to @entity2 , one of @entity7 president @entity10 's most outspoken critics			1
the court , in the city of @entity12 , ruled that @entity2 was guilty of misappropriating about $ 500,000 worth of lumber from a state - owned company			1
he was sentenced to five years in prison			0
the activist has called the trial politically motivated			0
@entity2 has often accused government officials of dipping into the earnings of state - run companies			1
" these people steal billions , " he alleged in a @entity1 interview in april			0
" i 'm making it harder for them to steal			0
" he said his conviction is retaliation for taking to task the @entity28 , specifically over corruption			0
@entity7 authorities insist that 's not the case			2
protest leaders arrested at @entity0 rally the trial was a sham , the @entity37 's top diplomat said after @entity2 's sentencing			1
" this outcome , given the procedural shortcomings , raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in @entity7 , " @entity37 foreign affairs chief @entity41 said			2
former @entity48 leader @entity47 said the case had " left a very serious impression , " in a statement published in @entity7 on the @entity53 website			1
" everything i know about this case -- how it started , how it was closed , and then opened again , how it was considered in court -- unfortunately confirms that we do not have an independent judiciary , " he said			2
" i am convinced that using the judiciary to fight political opponents is not acceptable			1
since @entity2 's lawyers are filing an appeal , i believe the final full stop has not yet been put on this case			2
" @entity66 foreign secretary @entity65 also voiced his concern about @entity2 's conviction			1
" the decision to sentence him for five years has highlighted once again the concerns felt by many about the selective application of the rule of law in @entity7 , " he said			1
street movement three months ago , @entity2 's voice boomed out over a microphone from a @entity0 stage in front of tens of thousands of people , as he blasted @entity7 's most powerful man as the foe of democracy			1
it was one of many street protests challenging the @entity28 that have burgeoned in recent years			0
@entity2 is one of their most prominent organizers			2
last year , the @entity28 took action			0
it passed new laws to curb demonstrations			0
then @entity2 was arrested and charged			2
he immediately believed he would not get off the hook			0
" they did n't fabricate the case to allow that , " he told @entity1 at the time			0
the real penalty @entity2 now faces a five - year prison term , a year less than the prosecutor asked for			1
but a jail cell is not the main punishment , he said in april			0
and he had anticipated that someday , he would do time for his activism			0
if his conviction stands , @entity2 will , by law , not be able to run for public office			1
it 's not an uncommon law			0
convicted felons in the @entity109 , for example , are also prohibited from doing so			0
but @entity2 hopes through his protests to one day overturn that law , which he calls part of " @entity10 's system			1
" @entity113 , deputy director of @entity117 's @entity115 and @entity116 division , said that while the guilty verdict came as no surprise -- as " the culmination of a criminal prosecution brought for political reasons with a preordained conclusion " -- the sentence was still shocking			1
it can only be seen through a political lens , as part of a broader government crackdown to silence a fierce critic and the opposition movement , she said in an online statement			2
" @entity7 's new laws are aimed at putting public life in @entity7 under greater government control , and @entity2 's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger , " she said			1
rights group @entity138 added its voice to the chorus of condemnation			0
the charges against @entity2 were " highly questionable , " and " the way his guilt was supposedly proven raises serious doubts , " said @entity143 , the organization 's @entity115 and @entity116 program director			2
" this was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial			0
the case was twice closed for lack of evidence of a crime , before being reopened on the personal instruction of @entity7 's top investigator , " he said			0
in 2012 : @entity7 protesters demand @entity10 's resignation @entity1 's @entity162 reported from @entity0 ; @entity163 wrote from @entity164 and @entity165 from @entity166			1
@entity1 's @entity167 also contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity47 : using the judiciary against political foes " not acceptable "
@entity7 court hands @entity10 critic @entity2 a 5 - year sentence
@entity117 : prosecution aims " to silence a leader and messenger "
@entity2 wants to run for mayor of @entity0 , but the conviction will prevent this
