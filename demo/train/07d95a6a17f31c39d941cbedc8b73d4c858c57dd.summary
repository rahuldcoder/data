-- if you do n't have the time , inclination and , more importantly , the money to go to university in @entity6 , you can still get a degree			1
it will cost you between $ us10 and $ us60 , it will take about two hours to complete and it will be fake			1
welcome to " @entity18 , " the name @entity6 mockingly gives to the strip of document counterfeiters that openly ply their trade between @entity14 and @entity15 in the @entity17 capital			1
located a stone 's throw from @entity6 's university district and , somewhat ironically , @entity22 , the counterfeiters of @entity24 can run off a university testamur , any type of diploma , a job reference and , more worryingly , a pilot 's license and a seaman 's certificate in a matter of hours			1
" today business is not so good , " says a hawker sitting beside a makeshift sign displaying fake diplomas , driver 's licenses and job references that can be bought for as little as 500 pesos ( us $ 11.50 )			1
" if we do five documents a day , we 're doing well , " he says smiling broadly			0
" sunday is our best day , because people start class or work the next day			0
term time at the universities is much better for us than the semester break			0
" our business is tied to the academic year , " he says			2
while degrees , licenses and identification from the @entity17 are the counterfeiters ' strong suit -- and locals say they can even source testamur paper from the year you graduated for added authenticity -- they will attempt any type of foreign document			2
could they do a @entity64 , for example , or anything with a hologram ? the man turns to a fellow hawker next to his sign and , after a brief exchange in @entity72 , both nod emphatically			0
" we can do anything if we 've got the original , " he says			0
" it depends how much you 're willing to pay			0
" for students in @entity6 , the strip on @entity24 is a one - stop shop for term papers and end - of - year assignments			1
" i once went to @entity24 with five other classmates and we paid to get term papers , " said @entity82 , a former student at @entity83			1
" i needed 30 pages , double spaced , on the @entity17 revolutionary movement under the @entity87 and , sure enough , i got 30 pages , double - spaced , all with a bibliography at the back			0
" i was too busy studying for the end - of - year exams to do the term paper			0
everybody does it , " says ms @entity82			0
these days , she says , the operators on @entity24 have globalised operations , providing academic texts to order online			2
" it 's becoming a good line for people in @entity6 that want to make a living by writing , " she adds			1
" i guess because of the high level of @entity106 in the @entity17 it 's a good fit			2
" while other ' diploma mill ' operators on the @entity24 strip operate openly and in full view of the law , the stallholder stands nervously to attention when two police saunter past his sandwich board			1
crackdowns have become more frequent since @entity6 mayor @entity118 , nicknamed " @entity118 " for his tough stance with the national police , ordered a clean up of the @entity122 mills several years ago			1
the stallholders on @entity24 rarely do the forgeries themselves , acting simply as runners to forgers who do the counterfeiting behind closed doors			1
in october , police raided one of the country 's most audacious scams ; an entire bogus government department that was collecting " taxes " using forged documents and ids			2
while police suspect the fake presidential agency may have had their own , more sophisticated , in - house forgers who used the latest technology to produce their paperwork and identity cards , the standard of street counterfeits is getting better			2
the @entity147 's @entity146 is tight - lipped about the level of sophistication of the forgeries , but admits it 's a tough game keeping ahead of the counterfeiters			0
" are the counterfeiters improving ? yes they are , " says @entity153 , supervising document examiner with the @entity147			0
" the good part is that we are also getting better at detecting them and that dissuades the forgers			0

@entity6 's fake degree mill does a *thriving* business on @entity24
known *jokingly* as ' @entity18 ' , forgers can mock up a degree in a matter of hours
@entity170 also fake all types of ids including seamans ' and pilots ' licenses
@entity6 authorities have *launched* several crackdowns but the *illegal* trade still *flourishes*
