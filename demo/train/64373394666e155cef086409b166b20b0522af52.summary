-- @entity2 president @entity1 is confident @entity4 chancellor @entity3 would attend the final of @entity6 in @entity7 -- if @entity4 reach the tournament 's showpiece in @entity10 on july 1			1
together with @entity12 commissioners and several other @entity14 politicians , @entity3 has threatened to boycott the month - long tournament , which @entity7 is co-hosting with @entity16 next month , in sympathy with jailed @entity7 opposition leader @entity18			1
" i 'm not worried about the situation , " @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview ahead of saturday 's @entity21 final between @entity22 and @entity23 in the @entity4 city			1
" the politicians they are in their role and the @entity7 they are in their role			2
i 'm in my role and that is not to do politics , it 's not to do religion and not to interfere in everything			2
" that means they can say what they want -- we continue to organize the @entity41			0
if @entity4 is in final of the @entity41 i would be sure that madame @entity3 would come to the final			1
" such a scenario -- and it is very possible given @entity4 are one of the tournament favorites -- would represent something of a u-turn for @entity3 given earlier this month she told the @entity50 , the lower house of the @entity4 @entity51 , that in @entity7 and @entity55 " people are still suffering under dictatorship and repression			1
" no regrets while admitting @entity2 had taken a risk in giving @entity6 to @entity16 and @entity7 , @entity1 insisted he had no regrets about the @entity61 governing body 's decision to award the tournament to the two @entity61 neighbors			1
" four years ago when all the slides were red , red , red , red , red -- stadium , roads , accommodation was red , red , red , red it was not easy			0
ok we took the risk but i say it was a good risk			0
" as well as dealing with the political fall - out from @entity7 's strained relationship with the @entity72 , @entity2 is implementing a set of financial regulations -- @entity75 ( @entity75 ) - that are designed to compel most teams to live within their means			1
the @entity75 rules apply now but will come fully into force in 2014			0
but this new stringent financial regime has raised the question as to whether @entity2 would prevent a big - spending team like @entity84 , which has incurred large debts after spending up to $ 1.5b on winning the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) for the first time this season , from competing in the @entity21			1
" i 'm happy for them , " said @entity1 , as he congratulated @entity84 on their title success			2
" but they will know what we will do			0
and if they are in the @entity75 they will play our competition but we will look at them like we will look at everyone else			0
" we prepare everything with the clubs -- we gave them four years to prepare something for the future , " added @entity1			2
" we will never go back			0
" technology opposed the former @entity105 and @entity106 midfielder and @entity108 captain , who led @entity108 when they won the @entity110 in 1984 , remains equally resolute in his opposition to @entity113 's likely introduction of goal - line technology in the summer			1
the @entity86 wants to introduce goal - line technology as early as next season if football 's rule - makers -- the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) -- sanction its use in july			1
" i 'm against the technology , " said @entity1			1
" if you say ok to goal - line technology , then it is offside technology , then penalty area technology , and we stop the football			1
i want human people -- it 's easy			2
i understand the fans because they want justice but with an additional referee we have the same justice			0
" @entity113 president @entity135 has indicated he is in favor of goal - line technology and would like to see it in place for the @entity140 in @entity141 , but @entity1 has not given up all hope that the @entity143 may still change his mind			1
" i am football , he is political			0
" he changes his mind			0
he said last year in the @entity119 never technology , never			0
this year he changed , he 's says let 's go technology			2
i hope next year he will say no technology			0
" looking ahead to saturday 's showpiece event between @entity23 and @entity22 , @entity1 insisted that that best two teams had reached the final , despite the widely held view that their respective semifinal opponents -- @entity156 and @entity157 -- are @entity2 's strongest teams			1
" could be , but the result is there -- it 's @entity22 against @entity23			0
i did n't see @entity156 be better than @entity23 and i did n't see @entity157 be better than @entity22 in these games , " said the @entity2 president			2
surprising season " everything was surprising -- the non-qualification of some of the @entity167 teams to the second round , the fact that @entity23 and @entity22 were not favorites for the semifinals and they beat @entity156 and @entity157			0
it has been incredible year for the legend of the cup			0
" next season will be the 20th anniversary of the @entity21 , which was formerly known as the @entity21			0
asked to single out his favorite finals , @entity1 picked @entity180 's win over @entity181 2005 and @entity156 's triumph in 2011			1
" @entity183 , was an incredible game for @entity180 against @entity181 and last year 's final between @entity156 and @entity186 was a great , great game with a great atmosphere at the stadium			2
