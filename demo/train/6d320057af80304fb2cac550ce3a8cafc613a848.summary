catholic bishops " will be held accountable " for failing to protect children from sexual abuse , @entity0 said monday , his strongest acknowledgment yet of what abuse victims have been saying for decades : that the cover - ups have often been as bad as the crimes			1
but without strong action to back up those words , such groups are likely to view @entity0 ' comments as little more than lip service			1
@entity16 officials have so far been reluctant to take action against bishops accused of concealing abuse			0
in a homily given during a private mass with six victims of church sexual abuse , @entity0 apologized for the abuse and asked for forgiveness			1
" i beg your forgiveness , too , for the sins of omission on the part of @entity34 leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members , as well as by abuse victims themselves , " @entity0 said in the homily , according to a text of the statement provided by the @entity16			1
" this led to even greater suffering on the part of those who were abused and it endangered other minors who were at risk , " he said			0
in his homily , @entity0 said that " all bishops must carry out their pastoral ministry with the utmost care in order to help foster the protection of minors , and they will be held accountable			1
" despite the strong words , a victims advocacy group , the @entity53 , or @entity53 , said monday 's session failed to advance the cause of preventing molestation by priests , arguing that " no child on earth is safer today because of this meeting			1
" " let 's not mistake this meeting today for real action , " @entity53 president @entity62 told @entity63			1
" the meeting today will not make children safer			1
" " i think that @entity0 has yet to take strong action that will protect children and he could do that by firing the bishops who have been complicit and who are transferring predators , " she said			1
opinion : @entity0 's apology on sex abuse still does n't cut it @entity0 has called for " zero tolerance " of sexual abuse by clerics , and last week a @entity16 tribunal defrocked @entity85 archbishop @entity84 after finding him guilty of sexual abuse of minors			1
@entity63 religion commentator rev. @entity88 said that was a sign of change			0
" so what people have been calling for with regards to the hierarchy needing to accept responsibility and action be taken against them has already begun to happen , " he said			0
@entity98 rejected the notion @entity84 's defrocking was a major shift , saying church officials had covered up for him in the past and have failed to do enough to facilitate his prosecution in the @entity105 , where at least some of the abuse was alleged to have occurred			0
monday 's meeting between @entity0 and the six victims of church sexual abuse was not the first such meeting between a pontiff and survivors , but it was the first of @entity0 ' papacy			1
it involved three men and three women from @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 who met privately with @entity0 for about 30 minutes in his private residence at @entity122 , @entity16 spokesman the rev. @entity124 told reporters			2
the abuse survivors also celebrated @entity127 with @entity0			2
@entity124 said the victims emerged from the meeting moved by what he described as a " profound spiritual encounter and dialogue			2
" " if you had seen the people coming out of the meeting , it would have been totally , absolutely clear that it was not a publicity stunt , " @entity124 said , reacting to a statement last month by @entity53 calling the meeting " self - serving			0
" " the most important thing the @entity0 hopes to come out of this occasion , is that the victims themselves felt welcomed and listened to , " @entity124 said			2
in his homily , @entity0 acknowledged that sexual abuse by priests has had profound consequences on victims			1
" many of those who have suffered in this way have also sought relief in the path of addiction , " he said			0
" others have experienced difficulties in significant relationships , with parents , spouses and children			0
suffering in families has been especially grave , since the damage provoked by abuse affects these vital family relationships			0
" " some have even had to deal with the terrible tragedy of the death of a loved one by suicide , " @entity0 told the victims			2
" the deaths of these so beloved @entity161 weigh upon the heart and my conscience and that of the whole @entity34			0
" @entity0 became @entity0 in march 2013			0
while critics have said he should have met with victims earlier , @entity0 has said he believes the @entity34 has been unfairly attacked			2
the @entity0 asked cardinal @entity177 , the archbishop of @entity178 , to help organize the meeting			2
@entity177 is a member of a new commission spearheaded by @entity180 -- to advise him on ways to help move forward after the @entity34 's sex abuse crisis			0
one member of the group is a woman who was a sex abuse victim .			0
