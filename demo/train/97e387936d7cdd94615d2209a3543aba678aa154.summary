@entity0 -- the political scandal involving vendettas and traffic jams ensnarling @entity7 gov. @entity6 's administration could stall the expected presidential hopeful 's career ambitions if he ca n't convince voters his apologies are sincere			1
so a chastened @entity6 , his trademark braggadocio only somewhat in check , did what problem - plagued politicians have done in recent years when they faced scandals : offer mea culpas with a heavy emphasis on the " me " part			1
effective ? we 'll see , said @entity22 , director of the @entity23 at the @entity24			1
" if he told the truth , he 'll be fine , " @entity22 said			1
" as long as he was n't involved in the act itself and the cover - up and he fired those involved he 's fine			1
if he lied , it 's over			1
" but there are times when it might be more politically advantageous to lie at first , then come clean later , @entity22 said			1
@entity6 drops swagger amid heat of scandal @entity38 former president @entity38 was a veritable maestro of careful and calculated confessions during a career riddled with sexual scandals			1
his mo during these salacious sagas apparently was not to come clean until it was advantageous			1
hopped in the sack with model @entity45 ? nope			2
then later , " yes			2
" that admission , following rumors of his sexual indiscretions , helped him pull off a second - place finish in the @entity55 primary and earn the moniker of " @entity57			1
" as president he initially said , " i did not have sexual relations with that woman , miss @entity60			2
" of course , that all depended on how @entity38 defined sex			2
he later admitted to the affair and apologized to the country			2
we 'll spare you a trip down memory lane about the affair with former @entity69 intern @entity60 and just say that one stained blue dress and an impeachment later , @entity38 was acquitted and remained in office			2
@entity73 the former @entity76 governor - turned - congressman , @entity73 , pulled a disappearing act on the public 's dime and time all in the name of love			1
he was able to rehabilitate his career after revelations he disappeared from office for days and , at some point , had used public funds to fly to @entity87 for trysts with his mistress			2
he bared his soul in news conferences and interviews with the media professing his love for the woman , @entity96 , and apologizing for the hurt he caused his family			2
state lawmakers censured him , but he served out his term and later was elected to @entity101 in a special election in 2013			2
@entity73 has a woman problem it worked out for those guys , but more often than not , political experts say , lies and especially cover - ups tank political careers			1
@entity109 take @entity109 , a politician who did not fare as well as @entity38 in a sex scandal			1
@entity109 , a @entity111 presidential candidate for 2008 , initially denied tabloid reports in 2007 that he had an affair with and fathered a child by campaign worker @entity115			2
then he owned up to the affair but not the kid			0
then , after details emerged about a plot in which campaign staffer @entity120 falsely claimed paternity and campaign funds used to support @entity109 ' secret family , the candidate finally admitted in 2010 that he was indeed the baby 's daddy			0
@entity125 former @entity126 gov. @entity125 had a penchant for @entity129 ties , a big personality and big hair , and he made some big promises about filling president @entity135 's vacated @entity134 seat			1
guess which one was illegal ? nonetheless , @entity125 took to the networks to proclaim his innocence			0
neither the @entity142 attorney 's office nor @entity126 state lawmakers believed him ; the feds indicted him for " pay to play " schemes , and @entity125 was impeached by the @entity146 and @entity134			0
he has since appeared on " @entity147 " and penned a book			0
now he 's in prison , with plenty of time to work on his acting and writing chops			0
@entity154 sen. @entity154 , a conservative lawmaker from @entity155 who 'd taken hardline positions against homosexuality , found himself in a gay sex scandal in 2007			1
his comments about having a " wide stance " became late - night tv fodder after his arrest in the men 's room at the @entity164			1
he was accused of soliciting sex from an undercover police officer by using hand signals and tapping his foot in a bathroom stall			0
@entity154 first pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of disorderly conduct , then said he regretted that plea			0
he said he was going to resign , then changed his mind about that , too			0
he ultimately served out the rest of his term and did not seek re-election			0
then there were those baffling @entity181 political sex scandals			1
@entity182 former @entity181 gov. @entity182 fessed up to his involvement in a high - priced hooker ring during a 2008 scandal that rocked the @entity186			1
he recently lost a bid to become @entity189 comptroller			0
and , for good measure , shortly after his inauguration as governor , @entity191 , the lieutenant governor who stepped up to fill in when his boss resigned , confessed that he and his wife both had extramarital affairs and that he used cocaine in his youth			0
@entity198 and we all saw way too much of former rep. @entity198 during a 2011 sexting scandal			1
he originally denied posting a lewd selfie to one of his @entity204 followers but later came clean during an uncomfortable and awkward press conference			0
he resigned from office , but we were treated to @entity207 part deux when , during the 2013 @entity189 mayor 's race , more explicit pictures emerged			0
can rep. @entity198 survive @entity207 ? @entity212 and just this week , @entity142 rep. @entity212 , @entity213 , returned to work on @entity214 for the first time after pleading guilty to cocaine possession in november			0
he went to rehab and then set about rehabilitating his career by apologizing for his actions			0
" i can not express how sorry i am			0
i ask for your forgiveness			0
i 've let down our entire country			0
i have let down my colleagues on both sides of the aisle			0
i 've let down my family , " @entity212 told reporters tuesday in his office , his voice full of emotion .			1

when faced with scandal , some politicians fare better than others
but it might be more politically advantageous to fess up later , political *observers* say
lies and especially cover - ups can tanks careers , they say
@entity7 gov. @entity6 will be fine " if he told the truth , " expert says
