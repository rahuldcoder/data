-- @entity1 from around the world gathered in @entity4 's masterpiece the @entity5 this week for a conclave to elect a new pope			1
the historic process is filled with pomp and ceremony and so shrouded in secrecy that its very name means " under lock and key			2
" but it 's a curious idiosyncrasy that , in an era when one of @entity19 's @entity18 's final acts was to send a message via @entity22 -- and his predecessor ordered that the @entity5 be swept for recording devices -- the conclave 's election of @entity27 was announced on wednesday evening by white smoke from burning ballot papers			1
black fumes earlier signified an inconclusive vote			1
and until the official announcement of " @entity34 -- we have a new pope " -- was made around an hour later , it was a modest little stove and chimney that stole the show			1
the @entity39 says the cast iron stove is " cylindrical in shape with a narrower upper portion " and approximately one meter high			2
" it has a door in its lower section enabling ignition , a valve for manual regulation of the draft and an upper door through which the documents to be burnt are introduced			0
the dates of election to the papacy and the names of the last six pontiffs are stamped on the upper cap of the stove			2
" @entity0 's senior @entity39 analyst @entity58 said the " oldish - looking " stove and its attached chimney were introduced to preserve the independence of the conclave process			1
" the whole purpose of the secrecy is to protect the cardinals from outside influence , " he said , the theory being that details of the ballot papers could expose the cardinals to repercussions or other pressures			2
the @entity39 's constitution requires a two - thirds majority to elect a new pope			2
on the first day of the conclave , one voting session is held : on other days the cardinals vote twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon			1
if a second ballot must be taken immediately , the first bundle of ballots and any private notes are burned with the second			1
the cardinals chosen to be scrutineers are responsible for burning the ballots , with help from the secretary of the @entity88 and masters of ceremonies , who are allowed to enter the chapel after voting has concluded			1
depending on how long the cardinals take to agree , pilgrims gathered in @entity96 could be reading smoke signals for days on end			2
and those signals have n't always been particularly clear			0

there was also mention of noise from where the cardinals were locked in and the firing of cannons at @entity119			0
" in the 19th century , @entity101 said , there was mention of smoke being " taken as meaning that there had been no election - and that they were burning the ballots after scrutiny			1
the smoke was described often as yellow			0
what i get from the sources that i was reading from the 1800s is that when they did n't see smoke then they were hopeful			0
" but the first reference to the different meanings of white or black smoke occurred at the 1903 conclave			1
" the primary reason they went for the black and white smoke was because there was confusion in the crowds as to what was going on , " @entity101 explained			1
but the confusion did n't stop there			0
interactive : selecting a pope @entity149 and archivist @entity150 said that in the event of an inconclusive ballot , wet straw had traditionally been added to the fire to make the smoke black			1
but uncertainty around the results of a 1958 conclave had led to the introduction of chemicals to make the color of the smoke more obvious			1
nonetheless , @entity0 's senior @entity39 analyst , @entity58 , said smoke from the fire " normally comes out an indistinct grey at the start			0
" at the 1978 conclave that resulted in the election of @entity171 there were some false alarms and @entity171 later specified that the bells of @entity174 be rung to signify a successful election			1
" the problem with that is that bells go off at the @entity39 all the time			0
" at pope @entity19 's election in 2005 , @entity58 recalled , bells had rung out at the same time as smoke came from the @entity5 chimney , but it transpired that they were just marking the top of the hour			1
the confusion occurred despite the introduction that year of an auxiliary smoke - emitting device aimed at improving the visibility of the smoke			0
" in order to improve the draft , the vent is preheated by means of electric resistance and it 's equipped with a ventilator for use if necessary , " the @entity39 said in a statement			0
ahead of this year 's conclave , spokesman father @entity199 said the chemical technique had been improved to ensure a clear color signal			2
once the senior cardinal deacon appears on the balcony overlooking @entity96 to formally announce the election of a new pope and his name , the little stove 's time in the spotlight should be over and the focus will then move to the pope elect			2
" he 's supposed to act as if it 's a difficult decision and then he has to be fitted with his vestments , " @entity101 said , estimating the appearance might come about an hour after the smoke signal			0
" if a man was really conflicted about the job , he may take a little longer			0
" @entity101 said that he was not aware of any wrong announcements about a new pope being made in modern times - but there had been some in the past			0
" there used to be a tradition that the @entity228 [ residents of @entity230 ] would go and ransack the dwelling of the cardinal that was elected -- on the grounds that he did n't need it anymore			0
there was at least one example of the @entity230 's residents ransacking the house of the wrong cardinal , during the 400 - 500 years the tradition was followed			0
" not only did he not become pope but he did n't have anything left in his house			0

conclave ballots and voting notes are *destroyed* in a stove placed in the @entity5
chemicals are added to color the smoke to signify whether the ballot has been successful
white smoke means a pope has been elected , black means the ballot was inconclusive
@entity171 ordered that the bells of @entity264 should also be rung if a pope was elected
