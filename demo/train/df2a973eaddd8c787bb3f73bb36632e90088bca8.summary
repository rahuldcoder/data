-- more than any year in recent memory , the survival of shows this season did not hinge on ratings			0
you had @entity8 's " fringe " getting renewed for a final @entity10 season with only 4.2 million viewers and slight 1.6 average rating			1
then you had " @entity13 " getting axed with 10.8 million viewers and a 3.6 rating			2
the biggest mitigating factor was a show 's cost -- which usually rises along with its age -- along with the difficulty of a time period , who owns the program , how intensely critics and fans feel about the series and , believe it or not , whether a network 's executives like the show			1
here are the top nine highest - rated canceled shows this season : 1			2
" @entity33 " ( @entity34 : 12 million viewers , 3.7 adults 18 - 49 rating ) : a 3.7 ? if @entity38 had a freshman comedy with a 3.7 average , it would run the show five nights a week this fall ( " @entity44 " was renewed with almost half this rating )			1
bully for @entity34 that their table scraps have these kind of numbers			2
the issue here was @entity51 's comedy was shedding too much of its massive " @entity52 " lead - in , and was trending the wrong direction			1
@entity34 suspects the time slot can do better			1
" @entity13 " ( @entity8 : 10.1 million , 3.6 ) : some in the industry feel @entity8 made a mistake not picking up this ambitious drama for a second season			2
" @entity13 " managed the rare feat of delivering a sizable family audience to a broadcast drama , found its legs creatively in its final hours and there was nothing else like it on tv			2
cost was a factor , but so was the network 's belief that midseason addition " @entity75 " would be the network 's next big hit ( it was n't )			0
" @entity77 " ( @entity8 : 9.6 million , 3.4 ) : the ratings on " @entity77 " keep sinking while the show , unlike other @entity80 - produced dramas , was n't hugely engaging for viewers			2
a second season would have likely seen a ratings drop into serious red - line territory			0
" @entity87 " / " @entity86 " ( @entity8 : 8.7 million , 3.3 / @entity88 10.4 million , 3.5 ) : i almost did n't put these two on the list because their conclusions were more like dignified retirements than cancellations			1
both respected long - serving solid veterans of the broadcast game whose cost / benefit scale finally tipped			0
both were given time to craft series - ending storylines			1
still , some dramas do manage to last longer , like " @entity104 " below			0
" @entity105 " ( @entity34 : 8.7 million , 2.8 ) : short - lived			1
critics did n't like it , and it did n't pull its weight			0
" @entity110 " ( @entity88 : 7.4 million , 2.6 ) : diving in the ratings , and @entity88 has several similarly soapy dramas like " @entity114 " and " @entity115 " ordered for next season ( @entity88 's new trailers here ) that could improve on these numbers			2
" csi : @entity104 " ( @entity34 : 10.8 million , 2.5 ) : viewers do n't really crave and holler for a real ending on procedural crime dramas like they do for serialized shows like " @entity125			1
" personally , if i watched any tv show for a decade , i 'd want a final episode that gave a sense of resolution , some acknowledgement that a story is being told and not just a perpetual weekly reset			0
so i 'm bummed on behalf of those " @entity104 " fans who expected a true series finale			0
hopefully @entity34 wo n't shortchange flagship " csi " or " @entity137 " when their time comes			1
( and , yes , " @entity104 " cut for age / expense / ratings ; " @entity141 " is slightly younger , and helping hold the fort on tough friday night )			0
" unforgettable " ( @entity34 : 12 million , 2.5 ) : maybe it was the title			1
maybe the somewhat generic format			0
but this series was one of the most , well , forgettable on tv			1
its ratings were n't terrible , but few viewers seemed terribly upset when it was axed			0
