-- when most people go to @entity3 , they head to the beach to relax and get a tan			1
@entity6 locks herself in historical libraries			2
the result of that sun - free research is her latest take on history , " @entity12			2
" " i came to @entity3 because it had been attacked , " she writes in her book , referring to her visit to the @entity15 in @entity16 , after she compares the combination of foods she was eating for lunch to the ethnic variety of the current @entity22 citizens			1
she acts like a tour guide on a trip through time -- stopping at this place and that in @entity3 to expound on historical events -- often flavoring the accounts with personal anecdotes or wry comments			2
when writing about @entity22 royals in 1819 dropping one taboo on what women could eat , she notes , " as a female carnivore , i 'm delighted that half the population was freed to eat pork			2
" exploring @entity40 history in a very chatty tone and with personal asides has put several of @entity6 's books on bestseller lists			1
in " @entity45 , " she dipped into the times of political violence that claimed the lives of @entity40 presidents @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			0
in " @entity52 " she wrote about the @entity53 that settled the @entity54			0
the author , essayist and frequent public radio commentator can hold her own against the quick wits of tv political satirists @entity60 and @entity61 as she proved on her latest book tour			1
with her writing , @entity6 says she aims to put a human face on the people from the past			0
she describes the bloody tactics that @entity68 used to end more than a century of warfare and establish the @entity22 monarchy in 1810			1
like a tourist she also details how her 8 - year - old nephew twists his underwear into a loincloth and performs " an amusing if insensitive impression " of the warrior			0
@entity6 finds the pluck of the @entity79 missionaries admirable for their willingness at barely 20 years old to leave home , family and country to sail to " the most isolated island chain in the world " aboard a ship " so crappy it made the @entity87 look like the @entity88			1
" but their mission to convert the heathens to @entity92 does not impress the self - described godless heathen author			0
she opines " there 's not much difference between @entity96 and @entity97 ( except that once a year the @entity22 god of war actually takes time off )			1
" @entity6 describes the native hula dances -- including one that is accompanied by chants praising the genitals of the king -- as part of an " academic nearly - religious spiritual tradition that is incredibly rigorous			2
" there are so many rules on behavior , land management , fishing and other areas that @entity6 describes the @entity22 culture as very conservative			1
so to her , the disagreements between the missionaries and the @entity117 about what was proper behavior , " was like watching two kind of conservative traditions squaring off			2
" she admits that she especially likes writing about historical characters that she did n't like -- including a man who faked being a @entity123 leader as he unsuccessfully plotted to establish his own @entity125 empire			0
but one of her favorite scenes to write about was the funeral procession of @entity129 who had died along with his wife from measles during a trip to visit @entity134 in @entity79 in 1823			0
their bodies were returned to @entity3 aboard a @entity137 frigate commanded by the seventh @entity138 , a cousin of the late poet			0
@entity6 describes a " fantastical scene " of all these people participating in a procession through @entity143 : @entity22 royals in @entity151 clothes , nine other @entity117 in yellow - feathered war cloaks , @entity137 officers in their uniforms and the missionaries in their black wool outfits			1
and then there were native @entity22 guards who were wearing a variety of western garb - but who apparently did n't understand the need for pants			0
@entity6 says the changes in the years that followed mostly had a negative impact on the @entity22 people			1
much of their land fell into the hands of the sugar plantation owners , the descendants of the missionaries overthrew @entity3 's last monarch and despite the natives ' petitions and pleas -- @entity40 politicians maneuvered to turn the kingdom into a @entity40 territory			1
but while the results are somewhat sad , she says , learning more about the meetings of strangers in history has always intrigued the traveler in her			0
" there 's this part of me that wants to leave home and wants to see something new and wants to meet new people , " she muses			0
" maybe that is how i , too , will meet my doom			0

@entity6 's latest book explores the history of @entity3 and how it became a state
she describes missionaries and natives as two conservative *groups* squaring off
although sad in many parts , she says @entity22 history is fascinating
