@entity0 took the first step toward a possible return to the football field tuesday evening when the @entity5 players ' union announced it had filed an appeal of his indefinite suspension by @entity5 commissioner @entity8			1
@entity8 initially had suspended the running back for two games without pay and fined him the equivalent of another game 's pay			1
@entity0 was just a few days away from the end of the original suspension when the commissioner decided to increase the penalty to an indefinite suspension once he saw a video of @entity0 knocking out his now - wife with a punch earlier this year			1
two suspensions amount to penalizing @entity0 twice for the same event , the @entity23 said			1
the union said , " under governing labor law , an employee can not be punished twice for the same action when all of the relevant facts were available to the employer at the time of the first punishment			0
" a third party should rule on the appeal , the union said			0
" the @entity23 appeal is based on supporting facts that reveal a lack of a fair and impartial process , including the role of the office of the commissioner of the @entity5 , " the union said in a written statement			1
" we have asked that a neutral and jointly selected arbitrator hear this case as the commissioner and his staff will be essential witnesses in the proceeding and thus can not serve as impartial arbitrators			0
" the @entity5 did not immediately respond to a @entity53 request for comment			1
whether the 27 - year - old @entity0 suits up this season -- or ever again -- in an @entity5 uniform is still a large question			1
in the past , players appealing a suspension have n't been able to take part in games , so an immediate return is unlikely			2
and there is the matter of @entity0 being a man without a team right now			2
@entity5 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' the former @entity70 star had his contract terminated by the team earlier this month in the wake of the disturbing video that shows him knocking out his @entity75 on an elevator in a casino in @entity78 on february 15			1
@entity0 still can apply for reinstatement next august if he does n't win the appeal			1
but to get a chance to try out for a new team , he 'll have to convince the commissioner that he 's learned from his actions and paid a price			0
then he 'll have to convince a prospective club that he still has the skills that earned him three @entity89 selections			0
it is unclear how long the appeal process will take , but under the terms of an agreement between @entity5 owners and players a date for a hearing must be scheduled with 10 days of the appeal			1
" typically , there has to be a fair level of discovery , " @entity99 , the assistant executive director of external affairs for the players ' union , said monday			0
" there has to be a process by which we can both discover and present facts around his indefinite suspension			0
so there 's no set timetable for that			0
" @entity99 said the appeal would be pursued " methodically			0
" in august , after outrage over @entity0 's initial two - game suspension , @entity8 announced a new league policy for domestic violence and other assaults			1
first - time offenders would be suspended at least six games and a second offense would draw a lifetime ban			2
but he did n't alter @entity0 's punishment at that time			1
@entity0 has n't spoken publicly since the indefinite suspension , but he texted @entity53 's @entity128 a message last week : " i 'm just holding strong for my wife and kid , that 's all i can do right now			1
" can @entity0 ultimately be forgiven ? ' sickening ' video @entity134 obtained two videos from the footage taken from surveillance cameras of the altercation with @entity75 in @entity78			1
it posted the first one , which showed @entity0 dragging @entity75 -- limp and face down -- out of the elevator , shortly after the incident			2
the in - elevator video showing the violent punch was put online september 8			0
@entity8 told @entity146 last week that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the incident			1
timeline of key events in the @entity0 case he also deflected criticism of his handling of @entity0 's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident			2
" what we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself , " @entity8 said last week			2
" but what we saw yesterday was extremely clear			0
it was extremely graphic and it was sickening			0
" later , the @entity5 announced that former fbi director @entity167 would investigate how the league handled its investigation in the case			2
one thing at the top of his list likely is an @entity176 report that a law enforcement official said he sent a dvd with a copy of the punch video in a package to an unnamed @entity5 executive in april			1
a woman called from an @entity5 office phone to confirm receipt of the package , the @entity176 reported , citing a voice mail played for a reporter			2
the league has said no one in its office had seen the video before september 8			0
@entity8 explained in a memo to @entity5 team owners that the league believed it would have been illegal to obtain the video because it was part of a criminal investigation in @entity199			1
@entity134 executive producer @entity200 indicated that the website paid for the video from someone who worked at the now - shuttered casino			0
@entity0 was a three - time @entity89 selection in eight seasons			2
he played on the @entity70 ' @entity208 championship team in 2012 season			0
@entity23 president @entity210 said @entity0 should be allowed to play again " i think so			1
i think that we 're all entitled to a second chance , " said @entity210 , who played last season with the @entity212			0
" obviously he made a horrific mistake and he 's paying for it			0
he 's already disciplined once , and actually disciplined multiple times by the commissioner			0
" @entity5 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans			0

@entity0 was released by @entity70 , suspended by the @entity5
@entity223 : running back was denied *due* process , penalized twice for same action
@entity8 suspended @entity0 for two games , then changed it after shocking video released
@entity23 says it will call @entity8 as witness , so he should n't preside over hearing
