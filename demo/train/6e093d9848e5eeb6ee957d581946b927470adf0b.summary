@entity0 , @entity1 -- while @entity1 is perhaps best known for its wildlife reserves , a burgeoning counter-culture is painting a very different image of the small south @entity7 country			1

@entity2 got up close to the hardcore rockers and discovered a passionate retro scene proudly celebrating its @entity7 heritage			1

since then , it 's evolved and grown , " he said			1

it started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metals were introduced			2
" @entity25 described a macho scene with unique rituals , adding : " there 's a strong sense of camaraderie amongst them			1
that 's the first thing you 'll notice about them as an outsider coming in			1

it 's an expression of power			1
everything is an expression of power for them , from the clothes to the way they speak to the way they walk			0
they walk with very deliberate lurching strides			0

maybe for an outside observer , from the west it might seem bizarre or comical but not here			0
they 're respected and revered in some ways as well			0

we 're there for a good cause actually			0
we help people on the streets at night , " he said			0
and for the hardcore fans , heavy metal is more than just a scene -- it 's part of the national identity			1

or at least that 's according to @entity94			2
" we want to make him proud			0
he made us proud with one man like him leading the nation			0
why should we be scared when our president is a rocker ? " @entity94 argued			2
" @entity148 is known as a small country			0
people used to think it was a province of @entity152			0
