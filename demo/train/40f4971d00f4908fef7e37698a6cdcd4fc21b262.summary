-- @entity2 's @entity1 does n't exist anymore			1
as recently as the 1970s , @entity1 women could be seen wearing miniskirts in @entity5			1
the tea and fresh fruit her @entity7 family shared over laughter with their @entity13 friends at home			0
the female lawmakers who spoke out in @entity1 's parliament			1
the tourists who were so enchanted by @entity5 , the country 's cosmopolitan capital , they called it the " @entity20			1
" when the @entity1 native recently returned home , all of those childhood memories seemed like a mirage			1
what she saw instead was what many @entity27 now associate with @entity1 : destruction			1
" when i got off the plane , i cried my eyes out , " she said			0
" most of @entity5 was destroyed			1
" @entity2 's memories represent a side of @entity1 that 's easily overlooked			1
as @entity1 prepare to pick a president in their national election thursday , much of the media has focused on pre-election violence			1
@entity1 has often been portrayed as a barbaric country where warfare has been a way of life for centuries			1
but not long ago , @entity1 was something else : a politically stable , religiously moderate government that recognized women 's rights , @entity1 natives and scholars say			1
@entity49 , co-author of " @entity50 : @entity1 's @entity56 , " says a @entity27 diplomat visiting @entity1 in the early 1970s said its citizens were so passionate about democracy that he saw them debate their constitutional rights in the streets			1
" the years after @entity57 , in the ' 50s , ' 60s and early ' 70s , were the golden years , " @entity49 said			0
@entity1 's ' wave of freedom ' @entity1 's earlier stability started at the top			1
it rested in part on its royal leadership			0
the country was ruled by a king , @entity65 , from 1933 to 1973			0
though a monarch , some say @entity65 tried to spread the power in @entity1			1
in 1964 , he convened a council of scholars , religious and tribal leaders to create a constitution that supported more individual freedoms			0
critics say , however , that the shah was slow to implement those democratic reforms			0
" the king and some of the people who worked for the king believed in democracy and the rights of people , " said @entity77 , now founder and director of the @entity79 in @entity1			1
" it was the ' 60s , and there was a wave of freedom			0
" @entity77 says @entity1 was , in some ways , ahead of the @entity27 when it came to empowering women			1
" we had more women in parliament than the @entity27 had in @entity95 at the time , " she said			0
" we were moving toward democracy			0
people did n't have much , but they were happy			0
" that wave of freedom filtered down to ordinary people 's lives , says @entity102 , an @entity103 who spent her early childhood in @entity5			1
@entity102 remembers an idyllic time			0
her mother worked as a journalist , and her father worked at the @entity27 embassy			0
there was hardly any crime in @entity5 , and the government was stable , she says			1
when she tells some @entity27 that her mother worked as a journalist in @entity1 , they ca n't digest the news			1
" they ask me if my mom wore a burka , '' said @entity102 , who is writing a book about @entity1 's food and cultural heritage			1
" i tell them she wore a miniskirt			0
" religious intolerance may be a problem in @entity1 today , but not as much in the past , @entity102 says			2
the country has a history of religious tolerance			0
its mixed religious heritage could be seen in two soaring statues of @entity135 that were carved into a cliff in central @entity1			2
buddhist monks lived in the caves behind the cliff , she says			0
" at one point , @entity1 was a @entity142 country , " @entity102 said			1
" in those caves , 2,000 monks used to meditate			0
" the @entity144 , however , demolished the statues in early 2001 because they deemed them graven images offensive to @entity148			0
@entity1 's earlier religious tolerance was due in part to geography			1
it was at the intersection of the ancient world 's great civilizations , says @entity49 , co-author of " @entity50			2
" @entity1 was crisscrossed by the @entity155 , an ancient network of routes that linked @entity158 to @entity159			2
wool , gold , silk and spices were dispatched over the roads , and @entity142 and @entity166 pilgrims settled into @entity1 , @entity49 says			2
" @entity1 has been called the graveyard of empires , but it 's more of a crossroad of cultures , " @entity49 said			1
the cultural richness is what @entity77 remembers from her childhood			0
though she was a muslim , she remembered attending jewish holiday celebrations			0
hindus , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 lived easily with one another , she says			0
" my mother 's best friends were @entity13 , " she said			0
" my mother had a set of cups and dishes that were kosher that she kept for her friends when they came over for dinner			0
" is the past romanticized ? yet there are others who say it is tempting to romanticize @entity1 's past			1
@entity195 , the program manager in @entity1 for @entity196 , a @entity197 humanitarian group , says @entity1 did modernize in the 1960s and the 1970s			2
but most of the country 's rural areas remained conservative in their practice of @entity148 and treatment of women			2
" there was relative stability , but the changes in the ' 60s and ' 70s were confined to very small , urban elite , primarily around @entity5 , " @entity195 said			1
@entity1 's stability started to unravel in 1973			1
a military coup ousted the king			0
if he was so just , why would a coup succeed ? @entity49 says @entity1 grew unsatisfied because change was n't coming quick enough to the impoverished country			1
" it was the lack of progress at modernization by the traditional @entity1 government that was the source of unrest , " @entity49 said			2
" it was not the fact that they were modernizing			0
they did n't have the economy to absorb all of those educated @entity1			1
" in the late 1970s under a communist regime , @entity1 's internal stability worsened			1
in 1979 , the @entity228 invaded and deposed the country 's leader			2
but @entity228 forces ended up getting bogged down in a 10 - year - long military conflict			0
the @entity228 were finally driven out by @entity27 - backed @entity1 resistance fighters			2
@entity1 resistance leaders formed a government but it eventually descended into civil war			2
in 1996 , the @entity144 stepped into the power vacuum left by feuding factions and took control			0
the @entity144 , though largely indigenous to @entity1 , was nurtured by @entity242 's military and intelligence services			1
the @entity144 " would have never been able to take over @entity1 without that support , " says @entity243 , @entity0 national security analyst			2
" the @entity144 has to be viewed as a creation of @entity242 intelligence with the objective of taking over @entity1 and putting in a @entity242 - friendly government , " says @entity49 , author of " @entity50			2
" @entity77 , the @entity1 women 's activist , agrees with @entity49 and says it is useless to negotiate with the @entity144			1
" there is no such thing as a moderate @entity144 , " she said			0
" if you will show me a moderate @entity254 , i will show you a moderate @entity144			0
" perhaps @entity1 can recover its stability			2
@entity1 and exiles recommend the same solutions : weed out government corruption , oust the @entity144 , boost economic development and prevent @entity242 from interfering in @entity1 's internal affairs			1
@entity102 , the @entity103 who is writing a book about her native country 's heritage , says nostalgia will not be enough			2
she and other @entity1 must return to @entity1 to help it recover			2
" it 's up to the people of my generation to go back and contribute , " she said			0
" i 'm very hopeful			0
i hope it happens in my lifetime			0

@entity1 exile says her world does n't exist anymore
she says @entity5 was the " @entity276 of @entity277 "
@entity1 say their country was stable and tolerant not long ago
others say @entity1 's golden age was confined to cities
