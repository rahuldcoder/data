-- you have a job , and it 's a good one at that			1
you are n't really challenged anymore			1
you 've been doing the same thing too long			1
your company is n't likely to be promoting anyone soon because it has just gone through a major downsizing , merger or takeover			1
you have two choices : quit and start over somewhere else , assuming there is somewhere else to go ; or look closer to home , right in your current company , to see what other ways your talents can be put to use			1
getting out of your career rut requires a mental tow truck			1
rev up your brain and consider these points : 1			1
if you told a 500 - meter sprinter who was 250 meters into the race that he was now going to be running a mile , what 's the first thing he 'd do ? of course , he would change his tempo			1
he 'd stride differently , pace himself differently			1
the first thing any sensible employee does in a downsized company is to do the same			2
realize the path between promotions may now be longer			2
the rules have changed in mid-race			2
tear out your hair and curse the gods if you think it 'll help , but the worst thing you can do is make believe it did n't happen			2
more than ever , it 's important to know whom you 're up against for those few remaining slots			2
what are the other people doing ? what are they overlooking ? is the next promotion slated to go to somebody outside the company to bring in " fresh blood " and " new perspectives " ? analyze yourself , too			2
how marketable are you in the outside world ? get to know your value and your options			2
if you ca n't grow going up , can you build your credentials and experience through lateral moves that would teach you new skills ? if you 're dead - ended in programming , explore the prospects in marketing			1
there 's never been a company yet that did n't need more sales			0
give yourself an alternative route			0
it 's a great way to improve your promotion odds long term			0
does the company favor a certain way of doing things ? is there a corporate style ? when you study the way the winners do it and compare that to the way you do it , you may not like what you see , but you 'd better see it			1
take a look at your personal risk factor			0
sure , there are ways to move up faster , but before you leap , look at the risks involved			0
if your advancement opportunities are fewer , you may have to find ways to stand out from the rest of the pack			0
you may fall flat on your face trying , but are you willing to take the chance ? do you have any bold new ideas to propose ? will you take on projects that really stretch your abilities ? you can get yourself noticed , and you may get ahead in the process , but your risk of failure increases , too			0
you 'll fail some of the time			0
if you do n't , you 're not trying hard enough			0
if you want to be the leader of the pack , you have to be willing to stick your neck out in front of the others			0
sometimes it 's risky not to take risks			0
add up all the factors : pace , competition , long - term growth options , risk and the hard facts about advancement			1
then put down your plan , in writing			0
if you can , share your plan with your boss , and then measure your own progress on a fixed schedule			1
if you still do n't seem to be going places , it 's time to tune up the résumé and look around for a new track to run on			0
it 's been said that the hardest part of climbing to the top of the ladder is getting through the crowd at the bottom			0
i would add that the first step is the hardest one to take			0
