@entity0 , @entity1 -- the leaders of @entity4 and @entity5 on friday implored @entity1 officials to shun violence in settling political differences and declared their " solidarity with @entity1 against all @entity11 threats			1
" @entity4 president @entity12 and @entity5 @entity13 sat down friday with @entity1 president @entity14 and met with @entity1 politicians from various factions in an attempt to avoid @entity20 - @entity19 conflict ahead of the release of a @entity23 tribunal indictment in the 2005 assassination of prime minister @entity25			1
it has been rumored that @entity28 operatives will be blamed for the killing , a seminal event in @entity1			1
@entity25 died in a powerful explosion that left a 10 - foot crater in a street in downtown @entity0 and had a similar impact on @entity1 's political culture			1
@entity12 and @entity13 traveled to @entity0 from @entity4 , where they met thursday			1
@entity14 issued a communique saying both men " held talks with @entity1 officials and discussed ways on how to enhance the national reconciliation and the internal stability in @entity1 and how to improve opportunities for economic growth and social development			1
" the communique said the two asserted their empathy for @entity1 because of " the daily @entity11 breaches of @entity1 sovereignty , independence and @entity11 's attempts to destabilize the @entity1 nation			1
" they " stressed the importance of continuing to support the @entity63 agreement , " a pact reached by @entity1 rival movements in 2008 , and to " complete the implementation of the @entity59 agreement , " an accord developed to end the @entity1 civil war			1
the leaders urged the importance of " everyone 's commitment not to resort to violence and to place @entity1 's interest above any interest of any faction , and to be part of the legal and constitutional institutions and the @entity75 in order to resolve any differences			1
the @entity4 and @entity5 leaders expressed their continued support for @entity1 and the @entity1 president and the interests of @entity1 and its people			2
" after the visit , @entity13 went to @entity84 and @entity12 traveled home to @entity4			1
@entity86 , a @entity28 spokesman , said the group " welcomes any kind of any @entity94 coordination and unity " and said the summit will play an important role in " repelling the @entity11 threats in @entity1 and in the region as a whole			2
" " the region is facing many challenges and pressures by the @entity11 amidst all the talks about a new war in the region and @entity11 's crimes in expelling the @entity104 , judaizing @entity105 and threatening the entire region with their scheme against our nation and the rest of the @entity94 world , " he maintained			0
@entity28 and @entity11 fought a bitter war in 2006 after militants seized two @entity11 soldiers and killed three others			0
the significance of the visit is that @entity12 and @entity13 have backed different political movements in @entity1 since the killing , with @entity5 backing prime minister @entity120 , the son of @entity25 , and @entity4 supporting @entity28 , which has representatives in parliament and a presence in the government			1
@entity25 's death stunned the nation at the time and prompted tens of thousands to take to the streets , blaming @entity4 for the killing			1
at the time of the killing , neighboring @entity4 had immense political influence in @entity1			2
@entity4 has always denied the accusations of being involved in the assassination			0
a @entity134 resolution demanded @entity135 fully cooperate in the @entity23 investigation			0
the assassination and subsequent investigation led to a complete withdrawal of @entity4 troops from @entity1 after 30 years of military presence			2
the investigation by the @entity23 tribunal into the killing is still going on , and the tribunal 's prosecutor , @entity145 , is expected to issue the long - awaited indictment between september and december 2010			0
it is @entity12 's first visit to @entity1 since @entity25 was assassinated			1
both leaders last visited @entity1 in 2002 for an @entity152 summit to launch the @entity154 peace process			2
last week , @entity28 leader @entity155 said he believes that the tribunal will blame elements of his party , but said he would reject any such conclusion			0
he also said that any indictment of a @entity28 member would represent a @entity163 - @entity11 effort to disarm @entity28 's militant wing			0
the @entity163 considers @entity28 , which has close ties to @entity166 and @entity4 , to be a terrorist organization			0
the @entity20 group is a political party and a major provider of social services in @entity1 but also operates a militant wing			2
@entity155 , in a rare press conference , said @entity25 's son , current @entity1 prime minister @entity120 , had told him that the special tribunal would implicate rogue @entity28 members for the killing , but not the party itself			1
" i told @entity25 when he accused @entity4 to bring us one single proof and i will stand by your side and support you , but you can not allow the instigation against @entity28 and the @entity20 in @entity1 to continue , " @entity155 said			1
@entity155 said forces inside and outside @entity1 " do n't want the stability in the country to last			2
" among many @entity186 , @entity28 is seen as a heroic organization , successful in having driven @entity11 forces from @entity1 in 2006			2
in previous parliamentary elections , the so - called march 14 coalition -- parties association with @entity120 -- campaigned on a platform to disarm @entity28 and opposed @entity28 's 2006 war with @entity11			0
" in the last five years , some @entity1 politicians dragged the country into a bigger battle that targeted everyone , " @entity155 said			0
" every day we were on the verge of a new civil war and we are all victims of a bigger plot that wanted to destroy the resistance in @entity1			0
" these same politicians want to drag @entity1 into that same phase once again			0
" so i ask their supporters : do you really want to stand by these leaders , despite all what happened ? despite everything they have done ? " this week , @entity212 spokesman @entity211 , asked about the meeting , said the @entity163 values " dialogue " among the three leaders			0
he said he suspects @entity11 - @entity104 peace moves and other items could be part of the discussions			0
" @entity4 's relationship with @entity166 is of concern to us			0
and to the extent that @entity4 wants to advance its relations within the region and around the world , it would be , you know , much better for @entity4 to distance itself from @entity166 and move in a more constructive direction			0
" he also said , " we think that president @entity12 and other @entity4 leaders should listen very attentively , you know , to what @entity13 will tell them			1
" @entity2 's @entity237 contributed to this report			0
