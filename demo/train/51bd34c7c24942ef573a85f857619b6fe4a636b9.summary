gay and lesbian rights advocates continued their undefeated run thursday when a federal judge ruled @entity5 's same - sex marriage ban to be unconstitutional -- though he did n't go so far to allow such marriages as to take place right away			1
@entity9 district judge @entity8 noted in his ruling that his is now one of 19 federal courts that have struck down state laws that bar gay and lesbian couples from marrying			1
while most of the time those decisions were put on hold as appeals work their way through the system , they have all reached the conclusion			0
like those other judges , @entity8 said the @entity5 ban -- first put into law in 1977 and written into the state 's constitution after a 2008 referendum -- violates the " due process " and " equal protection " provisions in the @entity9 @entity29			2
his ruling applies both to whether same - sex couples can marry in @entity5 as well as to whether such marriages elsewhere should be recognized in the @entity5			1
" the @entity5 provisions that prohibit the recognition of same - sex marriages lawfully entered elsewhere , like the federal provision , are unconstitutional , " @entity8 writes			1
" so is the @entity5 ban on entering same - sex marriages			2
" yet his decision , while firmly in support of allowing same - sex marriage , wo n't take effect immediately			1
@entity8 's reasoning : it does n't make sense to open up and allow such unions , only to have higher courts later reverse his decision and leaving some couples potentially in legal limbo			0
judges hear four states defend same - sex marriage bans earlier this summer , state @entity55 judge @entity54 wrote a similar ruling , based on a similar rationale			1
she , too , immediately stayed her own order " pending the outcome of the expected appeal			0
" for all their celebrations thursday , the fact that none of these rulings have taken effect , in full , is high on the minds of lgbt rights activists and groups			0
one of them , @entity72 , called on state leaders to stand with them as the issue continues to move through the courts			0
" @entity5 put this discriminatory ban in place , and @entity5 should end it , " the group said on its website			0
" our families have waited too long already			0
" the state 's top elected official , gov. @entity82 , has a different opinion			2
his re-election campaign spokesman @entity85 said thursday that while @entity82 " respects the many views @entity88 have on this issue , he believes in traditional marriage consistent with the constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2008			1
" " there are several cases going through the court system , " @entity85 added , " and the governor respects that process			0
" fast facts : same - sex marriage			2

gov. @entity82 for " traditional marriage " in line with voter - backed amendment
a federal judge says @entity5 's same - sex marriage bans violates @entity29
19 federal courts have *weighed* in on this matter and reached the same conclusion
judge stays his own order , *meaning* gays and lesbians ca n't marry right away
