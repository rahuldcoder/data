at midday tuesday , a 15 - mile stretch of @entity143 remained closed			0

@entity190 , an @entity176 command center manager , said many of the same issues hampering passengers are also affecting airline workers			0
another problem is the icy conditions at the gates			0

" those same workers are at the center of a citywide investigation into whether their supervisors intentionally delayed cleanup efforts after the @entity27 blizzard as a retaliatory measure for budget cuts and demotions			2
" the sanitation workers have got to realize that people are going to be watching them , " @entity67 said at a news conference			0
