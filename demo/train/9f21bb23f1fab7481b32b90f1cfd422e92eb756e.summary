-- on wednesday , angry residents of @entity2 , one of the poorest slums of @entity5 , clashed with police when they discovered that the government has quarantined the entire area in an effort to contain the spread of @entity11			1
this comes on the heels of another incident at @entity2 a few days ago , when people attacked an @entity11 clinic , releasing patients and taking bedding and other items			1
when the international community heard about the incident , it could not understand such reckless behavior in the face of a deadly outbreak			2
but living here in @entity5 , we understand			1
through my work as a peace activist during the wars of the 1990s and early 2000s , and now as an organizer with communities throughout @entity5 , i know how skeptical @entity5 feel toward the government and international aid , given prior bad experiences			1
the majority of citizens do not trust the government , which they view as corrupt , so they could not believe the whole story about @entity11 when it started being told			1
a friend of mine said , for example , " @entity42 ( president of @entity5 ) and her minister of health want to pocket money , so they have come up with a new tactics to collect money and share			1
" as the months went by , many radio talk show hosts led discussions about @entity11			2
people from all walks of life in @entity5 still denied the existence of @entity11 , including many at the waterside , one of the biggest markets in @entity60 , the capital			1
when i spoke about @entity11 , people accused me of working for the government , which was bad enough			1
but when i showed them my work @entity65 , i made the matter even worse			0
they said that i work for an @entity70 non-governmental organization , and we all are supporters of @entity72 and ca n't see the wrong she is doing			0
now , too late , everyone is talking about the invisible enemy -- the one you can not see			0
i remember during the war days in @entity5 , you could get news of where the enemies were coming from and take cover either in the bushes or some other hiding place			2
but the ebola virus is different			0
i have extended family members who have died from the virus or been quarantined for observation and testing			1
it is overwhelming to hear of people whom you have spoken to in the past six weeks , who are now dead from a disease that could have been prevented			2
9 things to know about @entity11 @entity5 are social and community - oriented			1
we greet people with handshakes and hugs , eat together using one bowl , sleep together in one bed and bathe dead bodies to honor them			0
some people are trying to put aside these cultural practices to save lives			0
i have noticed that a few people have started to wear gloves and long - sleeve shirts			0
many businesses and homes have buckets with water and bleach for people entering and coming out to wash their hands			0
a colleague of mine called and told me about a health administrator whose mother had contracted the ebola virus			0
the administrator took his mother to the hospital in @entity126 , capital of @entity127 , where my colleague works as a nurse and social worker for people living with @entity132			0
my colleague told me that the administrator was in complete denial that his mother had contracted the virus			0
he broke all the rules that the hospital had put in place : no visitors for people who have shown signs and symptoms of @entity11			1
every day , he brought a new family member to visit his sick mother			0
in the end , his mother died , he died , and so did all seven family members he brought to the hospital to visit			1
another day has come , and i got a call from a friend who is a social worker in one of the closed government hospitals in western @entity5			2
she said families that have been quarantined in some communities do not have basic food supplies and other items they need			0
even though they are not showing symptoms at the moment , they go out to fetch water and food			0
they go to faraway markets and hand - pump water and do not tell others that they have been quarantined for fear of stigma			0
another colleague says she took food and water to an @entity11 quarantine , but she was turned down and told that no food or drinks were allowed			1
ebola facility in @entity5 attacked ; patients flee people are scared for a reason : @entity5 's infrastructure can not cope with @entity11			1
with poor health facilities and a low number of health workers , it 's obvious that the government needed help months ago			0
heath centers are filled with suspected and actual @entity11 cases			2
but the call centers , set up for people wanting help treating @entity11 victims , do not answer			1
this has led to people dumping dead bodies on the streets			0
some patients who showed symptoms were abandoned or fled to unknown locations			0
tracing people who have come in contact with sick @entity11 patients is a huge task for the @entity199			1
it has become very difficult to trace people who have moved from one community to another , making it tougher to contain the spread of the virus			0
the @entity11 crisis is making many people think about what kind of health policies we have in place			1
do we need to develop new ones ? every part of @entity5 has been affected : the economy , politics , social and religious life			2
the economy seems to be dying slowly			0
employees from large companies have left @entity5 , as have staff members of international non-governmental organizations			1
the biggest iron ore company in @entity5 has sent its experts out of the country			2
after a decade of international aid to @entity5 and the emergence of a democratic government , what are we left with ? @entity5 is not strong as it could be			2
@entity5 is suffering during this terrible @entity11 outbreak			1

@entity238 : people are angry and scared ; infrastructure is *struggling*
she says some of her extended family members have died from the @entity11 disease
