@entity0 , @entity1 -- former president @entity3 loomed large throughout the 2010 campaign even though he has been out of office for nearly two years			1
the upcoming publication of @entity3 's memoirs , " @entity16 , " offers us an opportunity to consider the relationship between the former commander - in - chief and the @entity13 activists who played such a major role in energizing the @entity15 this summer and fall			1
while the @entity13 attacks on president @entity20 and his policies were front and center , their anger was also directed toward the nature of @entity15 politics in the age of @entity3			1
the @entity13 movement has opened up a civil war within the @entity15			1
recently these tensions exploded when @entity3 's top political adviser , @entity29 , said the @entity13 was not very " sophisticated			1
" former @entity31 governor and presidential candidate @entity30 called @entity29 an " elitist " and said that " unfortunately , there is an elitism within the @entity15 establishment			2
and it 's one of the reasons the @entity15 have not been able to solidify not only the @entity13 movement but solidify conservatives across @entity40			1
" the @entity13 movement was born out of a rebellion against one of president @entity3 's signature policies : @entity45 , the bailout for @entity48 investment banks			1
@entity13 activists have been extremely critical of the willingness of republicans to turn to the federal government to solve some domestic problems			1
@entity3 's support for the financial bailout was part of a longer tradition of @entity58 that has been around since the 1960s			1
in addition to national security spending , republicans in power have always lived with an expansive view of government			0
@entity66 came to accept the permanence of programs like @entity69 and @entity70 when he discovered they were more popular than the right wing of his party expected			0
@entity74 pushed through @entity75 one of the biggest civil rights initiatives since 1965 , the @entity40 with @entity78			0
under @entity3 , republicans undertook a series of major government initiatives , including @entity82 and the @entity70 prescription drug program			1
for @entity3 the question was not government versus no government , but rather , what priorities were most important			1
when the financial markets collapsed in fall 2008 , it was not surprising that he opted to use the federal government to help			0
@entity13 activists have called for a return to a kind of pristine , libertarian conservatism that they feel once existed			2
they have attacked all forms of federal intervention and called for their party to embrace a purer form of opposition to big government			0
a second concern for @entity13 activists has been the political process in @entity103			2
they have frequently employed the rhetoric of good government reformers in explaining what 's wrong with the system			2
the @entity13 has complained that lobbyists on @entity110 wield too much influence on @entity112			2
they warn that interest groups will be the biggest beneficiaries of new policies			0
and they have expressed their frustration about how congressional practices such as earmarks have been used to unfairly allocate public funds			0
these attacks touch directly on how @entity15 politics worked throughout @entity3 's presidency			1
by 2001 , @entity15 had learned to work within the political system to advance their objectives and to secure their power			0
indeed , between 2005 and 2006 , republicans came under fire for having practiced politics as usual			0
investigations revealed that there were tight connections between @entity15 and lobbyists such as @entity133 that had been nurtured by the @entity135			0
the @entity110 project was an operation set up after the 1994 elections whereby @entity15 @entity140 and @entity141 leaders met regularly with lobbyists to talk about legislative strategy and to find possible employment for @entity15 staffers			2
congressional republicans also relied on earmarks as much as their @entity149 colleagues			0
after all , most voters like their legislators to bring home a little pork			0
finally , many @entity13 activists have pushed back against the multicultural vision that president @entity3 promoted for his party			1
since his time in @entity159 , @entity3 had worked hard to bring new voters into the @entity15 coalition , particularly @entity162			1
he stood firm for liberalized immigration policies in 2005 , even as hard - line conservatives stifled his proposal to overhaul the system			0
after 9/11 , @entity3 had been careful to make very clear that he was conducting a war against terrorist networks rather than a war against @entity171 ( to be sure , many of his policies , like the use of torture and the war in @entity176 , undercut those efforts )			2
the backlash against @entity3 's vision of conservatism has been strong			2
@entity13 activists have focused on issues like immigration restriction and opposition to gay rights			2
some leaders were at the forefront of turning the debate over a mosque in @entity190 into a debate over the role of @entity171 in @entity40 life			0
@entity3 has also felt that the proper role for him was to stay out of the political arena , which has created a bigger opportunity for these voices			0
now that the election campaign is just about over , the party 's leaders will have to reconcile the tensions between where the party had been under @entity3 and where @entity13 leaders would like to see it heading			1
the impact of the movement on the @entity15 will create intense pressure on elected officials to listen to what the activists have been demanding if they want their support in 2012			0
the question will be whether @entity13 activists will decide that the @entity15 is just no longer a home for them and if other @entity15 , like former president @entity3 , will be left wondering what has become of their party			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity222 : @entity3 memoirs will be published soon
he says it 's a *reminder* that @entity13 arose out of *dissatisfaction* with @entity3 policies
@entity3 pushed for @entity48 bailout , immigration reform , expansion of government
@entity15 leaders will have to reconcile tensions between @entity13 and rest of @entity15
