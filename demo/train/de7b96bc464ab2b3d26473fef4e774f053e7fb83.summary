-- the @entity1 defended its role in a fiery multi-car crash on @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 , where 11 people died and 46 were injured due to heavy fog and smoke from a nearby fire			1
in a report prepared by the @entity1 and the @entity13 , the agencies concluded the drivers killed and injured in the january accidents were responsible for their actions by continuing to drive through the dense smoke			1
" despite the presence of @entity22 warning signs , some drivers did not take proper precautions and slow their speeds to prepare for reduced visibility , " said the report			1
the report also concluded patrol officers acted fairly when they made the decision to reopen the interstate after monitoring smoke and fog drifting through the area			1
" the @entity1 's review of the events of january 29 , 2012 , found its members acted reasonably , " the report said in its conclusion			1
" the rapidly changing conditions that morning in such a localized area could not be predicted with any degree of reliability			0
" the accidents occurred in the early morning hours outside @entity6 as smoke from a nearby brush fire enveloped the highway			2
the @entity1 increased its staffing from two troopers to eight after acknowledging the danger the nearby fire posed , the report stated			1
after monitoring the roadway conditions throughout the night , the agency reopened a section of @entity4 after the on - site incident commander determined the roadway 's conditions were clear			0
" response personnel continued to drive through the area at approximately 10 - minute intervals and noted no significant smoke or fog until the time the crashes occurred , " the report said			1
barely half an hour later , a chain reaction of crashes involving at least 25 vehicles , including semi trucks , would occur			2
911 calls from that evening reveal panicked voices and sickening crunches as cars careened into accidents that had n't had enough time to be cleared from the scene			2
after gov. @entity76 ordered an investigation into the cause of the horrific crash , the @entity75 released a report in april to detail the @entity1 's role in the deadly pileup			1
the @entity75 found that while there was no criminal intent involved , the @entity1 did need to revamp its policies and procedures in such situations , and improve its inter-agency communication			2
" even if each of the recommendations made by the @entity75 in its incident review were to have been present or occurred that night , it is probable the same decision would have been reached			0
also , no amount of planning or policy will take the place of driver reaction to low visibility and unpredictable conditions , " the @entity1 said in the report released friday			1
as conditions improved onsite commander @entity1 lt. @entity102 decided to reopen the highway despite fellow deputy sgt. @entity107 warning that conditions could quickly deteriorate			2
" " this would not have happened , " said @entity107 as captured on his dashboard camera while speaking to an @entity111 deputy sheriff			0
" they would n't freaking listen earlier			0
that 's what i told my lieutenant			0
that 's what i told my lieutenant			0
i said that it ( smoke ) will roll in faster than you can shut it down , " said @entity107			0
many of the @entity75 's recommended changes have been accepted , including improved training , procedures and guidelines when opening or closing roads along with better communications with the @entity132 and the @entity133 for the latest information on how smoke is affecting state highways			0
" the patrol has reviewed the events of the crash and is enhancing policies and training to advance our mission to promote a safe and secure @entity5 through professional law enforcement and traffic safety awareness , " said @entity1 director col. @entity137 in a written statement			1
" the crashes on @entity4 in @entity111 in the early morning hours of jan. 29 , 2012 , were tragic , and our prayers go out to the families involved			0
