-- a possible merger between the two of the largest companies in the concert business has raised protests from singer @entity6 and prompted a congressman to call for a federal anti-trust investigation			1
a possible merger between @entity10 and @entity11 has drawn interest			1
@entity10 , which has long dominated ticket sales , is reportedly in merger talks with @entity11 , the world 's largest concert promoter , which just recently began selling its own tickets			1
@entity11 did not respond to a @entity0 inquiry , while @entity10 's spokesman said " we can not comment on rumor or speculation			1
" " being two public companies , they ca n't really comment on it right now , but it seems very real to me , " said @entity21 , @entity22 's concert tour reporter			2
@entity25 : what do you think of the possible merger ? " you 're talking about a hugely powerful entity if these two combine forces , " @entity29 said			0
" they 're locking up a whole lot of the revenue streams for live music , and that is really the most consistent and profitable part of the music business right now			0
" @entity10 , long a target of fan and artist criticism , drew @entity6 's ire this week when it routed some of his fans trying to buy tickets to his show in @entity47 to a " secondary site " where they were charged far more than face value			1
tickets on that site -- which @entity10 owns -- cost between $ 200 and $ 5,000 , while face value starts at $ 54			2
@entity6 , in a message posted on his web site , accused @entity10 of " in effect ' scalping ' " the tickets			1
@entity10 ceo @entity59 apologized to @entity6 in a letter wednesday , saying it would n't happen again			1
@entity47 congressman @entity62 , who said he was " deluged this week by calls from angry music fans , " sent a letter to the @entity67 chairman asking that the @entity67 look into @entity10 's practices			2
after reports that @entity10 and @entity11 might merge , @entity62 sent another letter to the @entity71 calling for a probe			1
" there is an incredible potential for abuse when one company controls the primary and secondary market for concert tickets , " @entity62 wrote			0
" that potential will surely be magnified exponentially should one company be able to control every aspect of recording , record sales , licensing , venue ownership and ticket sales			0
" @entity6 's web message asked his fans to " make it known to your representatives " if they opposed a merger			2
" the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be @entity10 and @entity11 coming up with a single system , thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing , " said the message , signed by @entity6 and his agent			1
@entity29 , who has covered the friction between @entity10 , artists and fans , said combining the two companies could mean some fan - friendly changes , including rolling all fees into one ticket price to eliminate " sticker shock " when fans look at their credit card bill			2
@entity10 's practice of stacking " convenience fees " onto purchases inflated ticket prices and drew fan resentment			0
@entity10 pioneered online ticket sales , a modern convenience that did away with long lines at the box office			0
" what @entity10 has done to ticketing , they 've really revolutionized it as far as the old days , when you had to camp out for a high - demand show , " @entity29 said			0
@entity29 said he does n't expect ticket prices would " just blow up " after a merger			0
" traditionally , when there 's competition taken out of the marketplace it really does n't do a lot for lowering prices , but both these companies are very sensitive to the market and what the fans can pay , " he said			0
a combined company , though , would control " everything before , during and after a concert takes place over the course of an entire tour , and that 's pretty sizable , " he said .			0
