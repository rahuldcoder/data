-- for three years , the thieves crept into some of the poshest homes in the most exclusive enclaves in the nation			1
the gated community of @entity7 was one of several enclaves targeted by the so - called " @entity10			1
" police said they finally have a break in the case , and wealthy residents of @entity15 , @entity16 , are breathing a sigh of relief			1
" these guys were real good , " said @entity15 councilman @entity19 , who oversees @entity7 where some of the burglaries were committed			1
" the thieves hauled away more than $ 10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as @entity7 , @entity28 and @entity29 , police said			1
homes of @entity32 celebrities , professional athletes and multimillionaires were hit			1
according to @entity0 affiliate @entity40 , country music stars @entity36 and @entity37 and former @entity39 ceo @entity38 were among the victims			2
dna evidence led the @entity43 to suspected ringleader @entity44 , 45 , of @entity15			1
he was arrested near @entity45 last weekend			2
police say @entity44 led a gang dubbed the " @entity10 " that targeted the neighborhoods overlooking @entity49			1
" it 's a very euphoric , satisfying feeling that we got this person , " said the police lt. @entity51			1
" it 's a very frustrating feeling to tell the victims , ' i 'm sorry i do n't have any news for you			2
' finally when we got some good detective work and breaks , things started lining up			2
" police are looking for more suspects linked to the three - year spree but are not naming them			1
@entity44 is being held on $ 2 million bail , according to the @entity68 district attorney 's office			1
he is likely to stay in custody because he must reveal the origin of any funds used to pay the bail , authorities said			1
at a court appearance tuesday , @entity44 pleaded not guilty to two charges of residential burglary , one in january 2006 and another in march 2008			1
the preliminary court date for @entity44 will be set on january 29 and additional charges are expected to be filed , according to @entity0 affiliates @entity40 and @entity80			1
police will not comment on @entity44 ' background			1
the @entity83 reported that @entity44 told police he had been working as an auto broker			1
the @entity10 have not struck since @entity44 ' arrest , police said			1
" hallelujah ! " said @entity88 councilman @entity88 , whose district includes @entity90 and @entity28			2
" even a crafty crook does make his mistake and that 's what happened to this one			0
" some residents are cautiously optimistic			1
" we 're delighted , " said @entity96 , president of @entity97 , which represents about 800 homes			2
" we are very fortunate to have the due diligence of the @entity43			0
" @entity100 , president of the @entity101 , agreed , " we are all obviously thankful and relieved			0
" the financially strapped @entity43 created a @entity10 task force			0
people donated cameras and other equipment and police stepped up patrols			2
the outlay amounted to " millions of dollars , " @entity88 said			0
one in @entity7 donated $ 8,000 for infrared cameras that can spot burglars in the dark			1
@entity113 , president of the @entity114 , hosted a community meeting with the @entity43 at the five - star @entity116 a year and a half ago			0
as swans swam in ponds in the background , about 150 @entity119 residents sipped @entity123 and vented their fears			1
" it had gotten to be such an epidemic , " @entity113 said			0
the impressive mansions -- usually gated and hidden by walls and hedges -- dot the lush hillsides and canyons between the coast and the mountains			0
the qualities that make them so desirable also make them vulnerable			0
the seclusion that appeals to upscale homeowners also appeals to thieves			2
because many of the homes are tucked into the sides of mountains and canyons , behind gates , it 's easy for a thief to escape unseen and hard for police to get there quickly			1
" it 's the perfect target , " @entity113 said			0
" you can access the property and nobody would ever see you			0
" frequently , maids , pool workers and gardeners have access to the property , which allows burglars to pass as the help and slip in unchallenged			0
according to police and media reports , the methods were sophisticated			2
burglars waited till homeowners went on vacation or out for the night			0
they used lawn furniture and ladders to creep into the second floor , which often lacked alarms			0
they quickly went in , looked for jewelry , safes and cash , and ducked out with the goods			0
they never attacked any of the homeowners , preferring stealth to confrontation			0
residents say they learned to keep jewelry and other valuables in safety deposit boxes and out of sight			2
many added alarm systems and insured their belongings			0
" it 's not just about money , " said @entity188 , who lives with her husband and son in @entity90			0
" a lot of people lost things of sentimental value			0
" @entity188 , whose neighbors have been burglarized , said she feels safer knowing that police arrested @entity44 , but will continue hiding her mother 's antique jewelry and locking the windows			1
during a two - week trip to the @entity204 last fall , @entity188 made sure to e-mail her neighbors , notifying them that she would be gone so they could look out for strangers			0
@entity210 chairman @entity209 said he feels relief but is waiting for a conviction			2
" the arrest does n't mark the end of our concern , " he said			0
with the economy in a tailspin , @entity219 , who serves on the @entity222 advisory board , believes thefts will continue			0
" in these dire economic times , i do n't think it 's going to dissuade others from trying to do the same thing , " he said			0
" the burglary situation will probably get worse before it gets better			2
