editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 serving his fifth term representing the 7th district of @entity6 , was elected last month as the @entity7 , the party 's second - highest position in the @entity10			1
he also serves on the @entity11			0
rep. @entity2 says republicans want to make sure the massive economic stimulus plan is used wisely			1
@entity13 ( @entity14 ) -- bolstered by wide @entity17 margins in both chambers of @entity19 , the new administration assumes power tuesday with a broad public mandate to repair the feeble economy			1
but with such a free hand over current stimulus efforts comes great danger			0
costing at the very least a hefty $ 825 billion , the plan 's potential for taxpayer waste and special - interest - driven giveaways is enormous			1
we @entity3 believe we can help mitigate those risks if we are given a meaningful place at the table			0
president - elect @entity34 was correct to point out recently that no one party has a monopoly over sound ideas			1
rather than presenting an obstacle , @entity10 @entity3 intend to use the full force of our ideas to help democrats produce a better package to help pull the country back from the economic abyss			0
specifically , we want to keep the stimulus bill -- as well as all other future economic " rescue " measures -- limited in scope and transparent			1
our country has no other choice			0
the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) issued a sobering report that this year 's deficit will likely climb to over 8 percent of @entity54 gross domestic product , or $ 1.2 trillion			2
that 's higher than at any point since @entity57 -- and those figures do n't even account for the forthcoming stimulus			2
such heavy borrowing runs the risk down the line of rampant inflation , which scares away foreign capital while making the purchasing power of the dollar weaker for @entity54 consumers			2
while deflation may be the more immediate threat that the @entity71 and @entity72 are correctly focused on , uncontrolled spending and borrowing could easily necessitate much higher @entity72 interest rates to keep foreigners financing our mounting debt			2
especially given the looming entitlement crisis , this poses heavy danger for businesses and families alike			0
let 's not lay the groundwork for future financial catastrophe			2
let 's lay it for future growth			2
the stimulus can do that by focusing exclusively on strengthening businesses , boosting job creation and lifting consumer confidence			0
our preferred strategy is to provide meaningful tax relief directly to middle - class taxpayers and the small businesses that they operate or work for			1
particularly in down times , tax cuts can lift an economy by encouraging work , investment and business expansion			1
that should be the aim of the $ 300 billion in tax cuts the president - elect has pledged -- an apparent recognition , however overdue , that tax cuts are in fact stimulative for the economy			1
but we also accept that these are dizzyingly uncertain economic days for our country			0
the @entity17 have proposed additional spending for infrastructure and the like , ostensibly to compensate for stagnation in the private sector			0
like bears sniffing out food at a campfire pit , those looking for a piece of the multi-billion dollar pie have flooded @entity13 with a cascade of requests , some capable of spurring immediate and lasting growth , others falling hopelessly short			0
in order for the public to know that money is not wasted , two things are needed			0
first , we need to reconcile the @entity54 people 's demands for swift action with the fact that a good bill requires time -- time to hold hearings , read the bill in painstaking detail , and root out waste			1
second , @entity17 have to live up to president - elect @entity34 's vow for " unprecedented transparency			1
" the @entity3 welcomes and strongly encourages the president - elect 's idea to post all contents of the bill online for the @entity54 people to judge			1
lastly , any new spending must be introduced with the clear understanding that it is temporary rather than permanent			0
it is not always easy to terminate spending programs once they have been funded , but our bleak long - term budget outlook requires significant sacrifices over the coming years			2
we trust the @entity17 ' assurances that the economic stimulus will not be turned into a grab bag for favored interests			0
serving as the honest and fair check on majority power , we will work to ensure they keep their word			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
