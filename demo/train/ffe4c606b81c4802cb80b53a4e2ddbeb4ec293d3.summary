-- in the wake of the important decision by the @entity4 to block mining in @entity7 's @entity6 in order to protect the wild salmon population there , it 's a good moment to take stock of the many dangers facing our world 's waterways -- and our world 's fish			1
it turns out the wild salmon of @entity6 are one of the five least toxic fish to eat around the globe and thankfully will stay that way , thanks to the @entity25 administration			1
but what are the other four ? and why are the world 's fish and water under such threat ? a range of abuses of the environment flow into each other in our world 's oceans and lakes and rivers			1
there 's marine pollution in which garbage is intentionally disposed of or carelessly dropped into our waters to such an extent that , for instance , in the @entity46 , there is actually a giant swirling vortex of garbage estimated to be the size of @entity51			2
then there 's climate change			1
our world 's oceans have already absorbed 80 % of the additional global heat that has been added to our climate system and absorbed 33 % of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted into the atmosphere			2
with the world 's fish supplies already cut down by environmental hazards , mass fishing technologies like bigger boats and bigger nets have cut the fish population even further , which in turn limits reproduction and natural repopulation			2
a stunning three - quarters of the world 's fish supply is being harvested faster than the fish can reproduce			2
and 80 % of the world 's fish have already been fully exploited or are facing perilous decline			2
and then the fish that survive are sick			0
water runoff dumps poisons like industrial pcbs , heavy metals , including mercury and lead , agricultural pesticides and sewage system effluents directly into our water			0
fish eat or absorb that poison and when you eat the fish , those toxins are passed onto you , often at dangerous levels			1
so what 's an omnivore to do ? fortunately , there are good fish -- fish that are healthy to eat and responsibly caught in ways that are good for the health of other fish and our oceans			1
according to @entity106 , a helpful resource on these issues , healthy fish must have low levels of mercury and provide high levels of @entity112 ( the good oils our bodies can and should be getting from eating fish )			2
plus healthy fish are caught or farmed responsibly , which prevents endangered fish populations -- yes there are many -- and ensures that dolphins or other sea creatures are n't harmed by fishing nets			0
so what are the best fish to eat ? according to @entity126 , in addition to @entity7 's wild caught salmon ( the salmon now thankfully preserved in @entity6 and beyond ) , you want to go with canned wild @entity7 salmon , @entity129 mackerel and freshwater @entity131 salmon			1
also ... sardines , the subject of the video at the top of this story			0
wild - caught @entity46 sardines are plentiful and quick to reproduce and do n't eat a lot of toxins during their short lives			1
and they can taste great , especially if you find larger filets and grill ' em up			0
those are the best of the best			0
@entity126 also counts as healthy choices sablefish / black cod from @entity7 and the @entity149 , and troll - or pole - caught albacore tuna from the @entity151 or @entity152			1
and if you ca n't get these , there are less sustainable and only sorta - toxic options in between , but it 's best to avoid the " dirtiest of the dirty " fish , which include imported catfish and shrimp , bluefin tuna and @entity163 sea bass			0
in general , stick with the fish on the healthy list , and you 'll be doing your body and the planet a big favor			0
responsible fish eating wo n't solve all our ocean and fish problems around the globe			0
we still have to stop polluting the oceans and address climate change , which is hurting our nation 's water			1
but for starters , one thing you can do when you go out to eat or cook at home is pick fish that are good for you and good for the planet			0
it 's a simple and delicious step in the right direction			0
