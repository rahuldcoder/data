-- the crack of the bat and a bellowed " play ball ! " are annual @entity4			2
in the video game world , " @entity5 : @entity11 " ( @entity12 ) and " @entity13 " ( @entity14 ) have also both arrived in time for opening day , ready to crack the starting line - ups of gamers everywhere			1
each franchise has been around for a while -- 8 years for " 2k12 " and 6 years for " @entity11			1
" and , unfortunately , one of them is starting to show its age			2
the way you take to the mound is a major difference between the two titles			2
for pitching , " @entity31 " continues to use a gesture mechanic with the joystick controllers that relies on timing one circle to fit within another			1
the artificial intelligence has been fine - tuned so that batters will remember pitches and adjust accordingly , thus ramping up the realism level a bit			1
" @entity11 " has added a pulse pitching mechanism that determines how accurate your pitches are within your target area			1
it 's all about timing , but only utilizes one button as opposed to moving the joystick in a particular way			2
it saves a lot of wear and tear on the thumbs			2
there are animation differences that i 'll get into later , but fielders move and throw with good precision			2
both titles use a scale to determine how accurate the throws get -- " @entity11 " uses a circle ; " @entity31 " uses a bar			1
push a button to the corresponding base and fire the ball			2
holding down the button longer makes for a stronger , but possibly inaccurate throw			0
zone batting is new for " @entity11			1
" that 's where the right stick controller determines your stride and swing while the left allows you to move your " sweet spot " to the area where you think the ball will cross the plate			0
" @entity31 " already uses a similar style to determine how hard you are swinging -- and where			1
the feature also will gives you hits about the pitch as the ball is heading for the plate , much as a skilled batter would be able to recognize a curveball from a slider			0
" @entity11 " also has a simple button swing mechanic if that is more your speed			1
the animations and general look of " @entity11 " really make it shine above " 2k12 "			1
each player has a unique look and fluid movements in everything they do			0
pitching , hitting , throwing and catching the ball all appear very realistic and natural			2
it is a visually appealing game and looks like you are really watching an @entity100 vs. @entity99 matchup on television			0
" @entity31 " looks less like a tv broadcast and more like ... well , a video game			1
there are hiccups and stutters in some of the animation			0
most of the players do n't look much different from each other			0
balls hit near fielders will make sudden leaps into the glove or outfielders will jump slightly to one side before catching a fly ball			0
it is n't as well polished as its counterpart and looks old			0
and speaking of tv broadcasts , a tip of the cap to the announcing team of @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 on " @entity13			1
" their banter seemed fresh and timely , referencing the right things and never sounding boring			0
@entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 for " @entity11 " sounded stale and repetitive			1
some of their phrases sounded exactly the same as last year , and there were a couple of games when i wondered if @entity133 had gone out for a pretzel and just never came back because he was heard so infrequently			2
" franchise mode " is back for both games			2
you can also create your own player and work him up through the ranks			0
" @entity31 " offers an " @entity154 " mode that lets player play games at the same pace as their favorite @entity153 team			1
but that means you can only play one game a day in that mode , which does n't allow you to play future games or make up ones from the past			2
the new " @entity162 " mode for " @entity11 " seems geared more for a fantasy baseball fan than someone who wants to play a game			1
there are baseball cards , budgets , and customizable team logos and colors			0
if you are a stats nut or someone who likes to micromanage , this might be right for you			0
the " @entity174 " is back for " @entity31 " with a twist			1
in previous years , whoever pitched the first perfect game of the season using the title won $ 1 million			0
this year , the first eight perfect games will get the chance to head to @entity181 and compete in a live tournament for that top prize			0
" @entity11 " is compatible with @entity12 's motion - control move system , bringing its capabilities to every aspect of the game			1
they 've also tied the @entity190 game with the new @entity192 handheld console			0
games can be saved to the cloud on one console and downloaded to another for continued playing			0
for die - hard video baseball games , this means never having to stop , even when you are away from home ( provided you have a @entity192 )			0
the biggest drawback to " @entity11 " is that it is a @entity203 exclusive title			1
if you own anything other than a @entity190 or @entity192 , you can only play " @entity13			1
" fundamentally , it is a solid , enjoyable -- but visually underwhelming -- title			0
if you have a choice , " @entity11 " brings together realistic mechanics with outstanding animation to create an " at the ballpark " feel that outshines its competitor			1
all i need now is a hot dog and a frosty beverage to make the experience complete			0
" @entity5 : @entity11 " is available now only on the @entity190 and @entity192			1
" @entity13 " is available now for the @entity216 , @entity190 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221			1
both games are rated e for everybody			0
this review was done playing both titles on the @entity190 as well as playing " @entity227 " on the @entity192 .			0

" @entity5 : @entity11 " and " @entity13 " arrive just in time for opening day
" @entity11 " offers realistic visuals and smooth controls for a true " ballpark " feel
" @entity31 " has *superior* broadcasters , but some *glitches* and less realism
the @entity174 for " 2k12 " is back with a new twist
