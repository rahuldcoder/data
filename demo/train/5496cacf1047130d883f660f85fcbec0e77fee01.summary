as families across @entity4 prepare to watch the @entity5 , the safety of the game remains hotly debated in households across the country			2
after mounting concerns about brain injuries plaguing older players who experienced repeated concussions , the @entity8 says it is making progress when it comes to keeping current players safe the league says concussions in regular season games dropped 25 % in 2014 from the number in 2013 , and concussions caused by helmet - to - helmet hits were down 28 % during the same time period , according to a newly released report			1
but worries about concussions are just part of the reason why some families are having second thoughts about letting their children play football			1
as we 've learned more and more about the dangers of concussions and head injuries in football , including from research on the brains of professional players who died , we have seen a drop in the number of kids playing the game			1
participation in @entity44 youth football leagues dropped 9.5 % from 2010 to 2012 , according to a report in 2013 by @entity46			1
concussion concerns may lead to fewer boys playing football last year , after three players from three different states died in one week , i asked parents whether they think the sport is too violent and dangerous for their children			1
on one side are parents like @entity56 of @entity57 , who played football through high school and during college at @entity60			1
he says his 7 - year - old daughter will never play football , and if he had a son , he would never let him play either			1
" i have had over 10 concussions playing football , " said @entity56 , who says he was coached by some of the best in the business			1
" no coaching technique can result in safety when the point of playing defense is to play with reckless abandon			0
the kids today call it blowing people up			0
the game is violent , and people get hurt in violent games			2
" on the other side are parents like @entity80 , chief executive officer of @entity81 , whose eighth - grader plays football			1
@entity80 said he has certainly thought about the risks , but says the training put in place in children 's programs during the last few years has given him the confidence to let his son play			2
that training is part of the @entity92 funded by the @entity8			1
coaches are educated on how to deal with concussions and how to teach safer ways to tackle , where players are taught to keep their heads up and to lead contact with their shoulders , not their heads			1
" hitting has dramatically changed the game from when i was on the field over 20 years ago , " @entity80 said			2
" in the end , it comes down to the league , training and coaches			2
you have to be comfortable that they are putting safety first			0
" @entity111 of @entity112 , @entity113 , says her 9 - year - old is more passionate about football than just about anything else , and her 6 - year - old just started playing , as well			1
she urged her sons ' league to adopt the @entity92 and it did			2
high schools tackle football concussions " i think that it 's something you can definitely see in how the younger kids are playing versus how the older boys are playing football because it 's a whole different way of playing , " said @entity111 , a mom of three and host of the blog @entity124			1
" so i feel safer knowing that my kids are playing in a league that is doing something proactive about their safety			2
" like any parent , @entity111 says she has her concerns but what helps her is putting the dangers in perspective			0
" the risk is there , but the reward is so great , it 's a risk that we take and statistically i do n't think ... that risk ( rivals ) things like riding in a car or riding your bike			0
" other parents whose children play football pointed to sports such as horseback riding and gymnastics that can also be dangerous for children , but said the dangers of those sports often do n't get as much attention as football			1
" because of its inherently violent nature , football is often singled out for scrutiny re : head injuries and head / neck injury deaths , " said @entity160 of @entity161 , @entity162 , whose son plays football			2
according to a report by the @entity170 , deaths in football are " rare but tragic events , " with 17 direct and indirect deaths during the 2013 football season out of approximately 1.1 million high school players			1
' @entity174 may help detect concussions @entity176 , a divorced father of three , says his son was only 5 when he started playing ice hockey , another sport known for its concussion issues			2
his son is 26 now and never suffered a serious injury , but @entity176 thinks back to when his son was a senior in high school and was asked to play football			1
" i adamantly said ' no , ' " said @entity176 , who based his decision on the fact that his son had never played the game before			0
" it is my opinion that when a child begins playing a sport with injuries like this , they learn proper techniques to protect themselves and how to avoid causing severe injuries to others			0
" " i am confident that saying no was the right decision for my son			0
i would not presume to make that decision for anyone else , " he said			0
" i believe in sports , but i also believe each person needs to consider a lot of factors when choosing which sport to participate in and that a parent 's responsibility is to choose wisely when allowing their child to make this decision			0
" opinion : make football safe for our kids children 's television host @entity217 , a mother of three , remembers when her son was choosing between basketball and football			1
both sports have a connection to her family , she said			0
her adopted father played for the @entity225 , while her birth father , whom she only met once , played college football and was drafted by a professional team			0
he died of dementia before he reached 60 and she wonders if his deteriorating condition was related to his participation in football			1
as her son , who excelled in many sports , was deciding which to focus on , she left the decision to him -- but quietly prayed he 'd pass on football			0
" silently i said a prayer to the sports gods above to put basketball first and firmly in his dreams			0
it worked and i am grateful , " said the social media specialist and @entity242 contributor			0
what sport a child may or may not play is an individual parent 's decision -- or an individual child 's decision			0
as @entity111 told me , if a child is passionate about a sport or an instrument or some other activity , would n't a parent want to nurse those passions ? and while there is definite debate over whether football has become too dangerous for our children knowing what we know now , it 's clear there 's agreement on a key way to help keep our kids safe : making sure safety is the top focus			1
@entity270 , a psychologist , educational consultant and mom of two grown children in southern @entity273 , said her son played school and regional soccer for years , and suffered one concussion and several other injuries			2
while opposing coaches always urged him to keep playing , she praised her son 's " astute team coach " who was always cautious and would send him off the field and to the emergency room			0
" as with everything in our lives , including football , soccer and other sports , common sense and safety need to prevail , " said @entity270 , who is also the owner of a business providing sign language instruction			0
" the lesson that we care about health and safety far outweighs the game			0
" would you or do you let your kids play football ? tell @entity299 on @entity300 or @entity301 on @entity302 .			0

the @entity8 reported that concussions in the league were down 25 % in 2014
