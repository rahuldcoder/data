@entity0 -- vice president @entity2 and @entity4 vice presidential contender @entity3 plowed fertile ground in terms of policy and politics during their debate -- now the question is whether the presidential candidates can reap what was sown			1
@entity2 aggressively pressed @entity3 on thursday to defend his ticket 's positions on everything from @entity16 to trimming the nation 's debt to the way forward in dealing with @entity20			1
@entity2 tried to frame the election as a choice between different directions for the country by contending policies of the @entity27 ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues , like gay rights and abortion			2
in doing so , @entity2 helped set up president @entity34 to further those arguments during the second presidential debate on tuesday in @entity37 , political experts say			1
for his part , @entity3 was equally hard - charging and vigorously put forth the ticket 's domestic and foreign policy proposals in exchanges that were at times sharp and pointed			2
@entity3 repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the @entity34 - @entity2 record of the last four years , arguing the administration 's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation 's standing and influence in the world			1
five things we learned from thursday 's vice presidential debate @entity54 is now well - primed to drive that message home			1
a @entity1 - @entity58 poll released after the debate suggested voters who watched narrowly favored @entity3 over @entity2 by 48 % -44 % , a statistically even result			1
that followed an overwhelming @entity54 victory in their first of three debates			0
" i think they both accomplished the kinds of things they wanted to accomplish , " said @entity65 , chairman of @entity67 's political science department			0
political analysts say @entity2 also helped re-energize @entity73 , whose spirits might have flagged after @entity34 's lackluster performance in last week 's debate			1
5 independent perspectives on the vp debate " the most important job @entity2 did for @entity34 is reawakening the depressed @entity73 base , " said @entity79 , director of the @entity81 's @entity80			2
" @entity2 has primed them for a better performance from @entity34			2
" what @entity2 failed to do , some political analysts say , is make the case that @entity34 deserves another four years			1
that 's up to the president when he takes the stage next week			0
debate aftermath : @entity54 hammers @entity2 on @entity94 remark @entity95 , a @entity1 senior political analyst and editorial director of the @entity97 , said " as strong as @entity2 was , " there was almost nothing on what a second @entity34 term would mean for @entity102 , especially on the economy			1
" that is still the big missing piece in their argument , " @entity95 said			0
@entity3 was able to capitalize on @entity54 's momentum from his well - received debate performance			1
the @entity113 congressman 's performance further smooths @entity54 's path to charge ahead , political experts say			2
" @entity3 was a steady , unflappable presence onstage who made an articulate set of arguments in favor of conservative principles while also seeming sensitive and reasonable to many moderates , " @entity115 , a senior political analyst for @entity1 , wrote friday			2
" @entity3 was also surprisingly strong on foreign policy , holding his own against a man far more schooled in the subject			0
" however , some political watchers said @entity3 's response on women 's health issues could prove problematic for @entity54 during the next two debates			1
" it 's kind of the untalked about thing this morning -- raised a bunch of issues for the campaigns to be talking about over the next couple of weeks , " @entity130 , a @entity73 pundit and @entity1 contributor , said			0
" yes , the economy is important , but when women have to worry about their health care and the economy , that 's just an extra burden			0
" but @entity1 contributor and @entity147 blogger @entity145 , appearing on " @entity144 " with @entity130 , said most women agree with the @entity27 position			0
" i 'm sorry , @entity130 , but you 're just wrong on this , " he said			0
" in the @entity159 poll , the @entity154 poll , @entity155 poll , you name it , they show that the majority of women in this country , they are pro-life			0
they consider themselves for pro-life , with the exceptions @entity3 named ( in the debate )			0
" @entity1 's @entity169 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 and @entity3 tangled in debate , which experts called a draw
both scored on policy points and set up presidential candidates to continue arguments
*unanswered* was why @entity34 deserves second term ; trust on women 's issues for @entity54 - @entity3
@entity94 security , economy , @entity16 drove vice presidential debate
