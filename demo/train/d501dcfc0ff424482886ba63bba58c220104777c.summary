in aid , under a controversial , open - ended deal that has been criticized as " a new low " in @entity4 's treatment of asylum seekers			1
@entity4 's immigration minister @entity11 was in @entity12 friday to sign the agreement , as protesters there demonstrated outside the @entity4 embassy			2
" @entity1 is poor ... ca n't help the refugees from @entity4 , " read one placard			1
before his departure , @entity11 told @entity4 public broadcaster @entity20 that the deal would initially apply to refugees being held on @entity4 's offshore detention center on @entity25 , more than 200 of whom had been granted refugee status			1
instead of finding refuge in their target destination , asylum seekers who agreed to the terms would instead be settled in @entity1 , one of southeast @entity34 's poorest nations			1
it would be " an ongoing arrangement " with no caps on total numbers involved , said @entity11			0
" this is a voluntary arrangement			0
no - one is forcing anyone to go anywhere , " he said during the interview			0
" it enables us to fulfill on the policy which says no one will be resettled in @entity4			2
" @entity4 's government was elected a year ago partly on a pledge to halt the flow of asylum seekers arriving by boat			2
@entity11 said @entity4 would provide a $ 40 million ( $ 35 million ) in development aid projects over four years as part of the deal , in addition to the $ 79 million ( $ 69 million ) already allocated to @entity1			1
@entity4 would also provide expertise on developing @entity1 's capacity to settle refugees , he said			1
' shameful ' deal the plan to outsource refugees to an impoverished country -- which , as a consequence of its recent history of civil war , genocide and occupation , is better known for generating its own waves of refugees into the world -- has drawn widespread criticism			1
@entity4 senator @entity74 , immigration spokesperson for the @entity75 , lambasted the government for signing " an open - ended deal with one of the most corrupt nations on @entity80			1
" " it 's shameful that the @entity83 government is forcing refugees to choose between cruelty on @entity25 and cruelty in @entity1 , " she told @entity0			1
" there is nothing optional about this deal			0
it 's like the bully in the schoolyard asking if you want a punch in the face or a kick in the guts			0
" the @entity4 government itself has recently criticized @entity1 's human rights record , saying at the @entity100 earlier this year that it needed to stop its military from killing street protesters , quashing political opposition and detaining people without trial			1
@entity1 rates 160th out of 177 countries on @entity109 's corruption perceptions index			2
of particular concern , said @entity74 , was the potential fate of unaccompanied girls among the refugees			0
" human rights organizations have said the incidence of rape and sexual exploitation is on the rise in @entity1 , especially for girls and young women , " she said			2
" the moment these girls step off the plane , they will be put at risk			0
" ' shirking responsibilities ' refugee advocate @entity127 , executive director of @entity4 's @entity128 , said the agreement risked " violating rights and endangering lives			1
" " the deal involves @entity4 once again shirking rather than shouldering its responsibilities to refugees in our region and globally , " he said , describing @entity1 as " a completely unsuitable place to resettle refugees			1
" " it 's a country that can barely meet the needs of its own population , let alone the basic needs of refugees			0
the reality is that refugees will be forced to live a life of danger and despair on the margins			2
" in a statement , @entity149 described the agreement as " a new low in @entity4 's deplorable and inhumane treatment of asylum seekers			2
" " this agreement is putting the short - term political interests of the @entity4 government ahead of the protection of some of the world 's most vulnerable people , " said @entity83 , the organization 's deputy @entity155 director			1
" it makes @entity1 complicit in @entity4 's human rights breaches and seriously flawed offshore processing system			1
" that processing system , established by the previous government , sees new arrivals processed in overcrowded immigration detention centers in @entity172 and @entity25 , in a policy that has been criticized by the @entity100 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity174 )			0
more than 1,200 asylum seekers are currently detained in @entity25 , with 250 status determinations carried out to date			0
more than 200 were found to be genuine refugees			0
@entity174 said in a statement it was " deeply concerned " at the precedent set by the deal			0
" this is a worrying departure from international norms			0
we are seeing record forced displacement globally , with 87 per cent of refugees now being hosted in developing countries , " said @entity100 high commissioner for refugees @entity183			0
" it 's crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere			0
