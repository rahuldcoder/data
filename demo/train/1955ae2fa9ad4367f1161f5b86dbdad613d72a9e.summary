-- @entity3 and @entity4 released news of their relationship to limit paparazzi intrusion on their romance , the world 's no. 2 golfer said wednesday			1
the 14 - time major champion is preparing for the @entity13 tournament in @entity14 , where a win would see him reclaim the number one ranking for the first time in over two years			1
@entity3 and @entity4 -- a four time @entity20 skiing champion -- released statements and a series of pictures confirming their relationship on monday			1
and the 37 - year - old told a press conference at the @entity28 course they had put out the snaps to prevent any invasion into their lives from photographers that he referred to as the " stalkerazzi			1
" perfect match : when athletes date " it 's very simple , we 're very happy where we are at but also we wanted to limit the stalkerazzi and all those sleazy websites out there following us , " he told reporters			1
" i 've had situations where it 's been very dangerous for my kids , the extent that they 'll go to			2
we basically devalued the first photos			0
" unfortunately that 's just the way it is in our society right now and we felt it was the best thing to do and we 're very happy about it			2
" the pair 's relationship has been big news since monday 's confirmation but @entity3 is now focused on trying to wrest golf 's world no. 1 crown back from friend , rival and @entity65 stablemate @entity64			1
it would mark a significant transformation for @entity3 , whose stuttering form in recent years saw his ranking slump past the 50 mark at one point			1
but after victory at the @entity75 in @entity76 last week -- his 17th @entity73 title -- @entity77 can now reach golf 's pinnacle if he can secure his 77th @entity81 triumph			1
" i feel like i 'm headed in the right direction , " he said			0
" i 'm very pleased where i 've come from			0
like i said , 50 â€‘ plus to where i 'm at is no small task			0
" i 'd like to get to 19 - plus ( majors ) myself			2
getting back to number one and all that it entails , it 's not easy to get there in the first place			1
i do n't think people realize how hard it is to get to number one in the world			2
" it 's been a long process			2
i was hurt for a long time , i had to make swing changes that were drastically different than what i was doing before			0
it 's taken some time			0
" @entity3 is defending champion at @entity28 , beating 2010 @entity103 champion @entity102 by five shots last year to secure his first tournament win since 2009			1
he has won four more times in the last 12 months and he puts a large slice of his resurgence down to the fact that he has remained injury free during that period			0
" i just needed to get healthy , " he added			0
" once i got healthy and i was able to practice properly , i felt like then i could implement the swing changes that ( coach ) @entity113 ( @entity114 ) wanted me to put in there			0
" but i needed to get healthy enough where i could practice			0
it happened to be a perfect storm where i was making a swing change , and i was hurt , and i could n't devote any time to it			0
" to gradually work my way back , that 's something i 'm proud of			1
" @entity77 ' game attracted praise from @entity125 himself , who won seven major titles during a glittering career that has seen him regarded as one of the finest to play the game			0
" i think right now looking at him and watching him play , he looks probably as strong and as good from a golf perspective as i 've ever seen him , " the 83 - year - old told reporters			1
" i think his swing and his posture and his attitude is far better than it 's been in some time , and it takes me back to when i first played with him at @entity141 when he was a rookie			2
" i give him a chance			0
i suppose that every year it 's a little more fleeting , however , and he 'll have to really work hard to keep himself up and keep his mental attitude if he 's going to do it			2
