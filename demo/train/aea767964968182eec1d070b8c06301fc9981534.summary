-- most of the big tech companies implicated in the ongoing controversy over secret government web surveillance insist they turned over data about users to the @entity7 only after being compelled by court orders			1
but a new report claims that @entity10 willingly collaborated with the @entity7 and even allowed federal agents to circumvent the company 's own encryption system to spy on users ' messages			1
the latest bombshell from the @entity19 's @entity18 newspaper , which along with the @entity20 broke the @entity7 snooping story last month , says that @entity10 helped the @entity7 circumvent its encryption to intercept web chats on its new @entity25 portal			1
the @entity18 , citing " top - secret " documents , said the @entity7 already had access to pre-encrypted e-mail on @entity29 , including @entity25			1
the @entity7 allegedly listened in on numerous video calls made via @entity31 , which @entity10 bought two years ago			0
and @entity10 also worked with the @entity32 this year to give the @entity7 easier access to its cloud storage service @entity34 , which has more than 250 million users worldwide , according to the @entity18 's report , published thursday			1
in a statement , @entity10 immediately denied many of the @entity18 's claims , saying the company turns over data on customers only in response to legal requests			1
" first , we take our commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously , so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes			2
second , our compliance team examines all demands very closely , and we reject them if we believe they are n't valid			0
" @entity57 , we only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers , and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks , as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate , " the company said			0
" to be clear , @entity10 does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to @entity34 , @entity25 , @entity31 or any @entity10 product			1
" news reports , based in part on documents provided by former @entity7 contractor @entity73 , have described a classified @entity76 intelligence system called @entity77 that examines e-mails , videos , online chats and other data that it collects via requests made under the @entity83			2
the revelations about @entity77 have alarmed everyone from members of @entity87 and foreign leaders to privacy activists and citizens who organized @entity92 protests across the @entity76 on the @entity93			0
like @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and other tech titans linked by news reports to the @entity77 , @entity10 has been working in recent weeks to convince customers that it values their privacy and safeguards their personal data against wanton snooping by a government trying to root out terrorists			2
in lobbying for greater transparency on national security - related requests , @entity10 revealed last month that it had received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants , subpoenas and other orders in the last six months of 2012			0
these requests affected between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts -- a tiny fraction of the company 's hundreds of millions of users -- and came from local , state and federal agencies , @entity10 said			0
" when we upgrade or update products legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request , " @entity10 said in its statement thursday			2
" there are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely			0
that 's why we 've argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues			0
