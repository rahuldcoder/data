-- @entity2 security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in the southern city of @entity7 on tuesday , killing at least two protesters and wounding at least 150 people , according to medical officials on the scene tuesday			1
" they are killing everybody , " one official said			2
" they attacked us -- even medical personnel			1
" the man , who asked to be identified only as a medical official for fear of reprisals , said he was riding with patients in an ambulance as he spoke			1
" even in this ambulance that is marked as an ambulance , they shot at it , " he said			2
" we had to get on the floor of the ambulance			2
we are not safe even transferring injured patients			2
" although troops @entity32 and other member states in the @entity35 are in @entity2 , there have been no reports of those soldiers being involved in the @entity7 clashes			1
a @entity32 soldier was killed in @entity2 on tuesday , a @entity32 official said			1
the @entity41 issued a statement calling for " calm and restraint on all sides " and urging a political solution through dialogue , not a military solution			1
@entity41 secretary of state @entity51 , now in @entity52 , @entity53 , expressed " deep concern " about @entity2 in a conversation with @entity32 foreign minister @entity55 on tuesday , a senior @entity50 official said			1
@entity57 later said it was important for all parties to promote dialogue instead of violence			1
" you ca n't solve this problem by just trying to bring security to bear			2
you have to have a political solution , " she said			2
@entity2 's @entity67 has imposed a three - month state of emergency in the island nation , effective tuesday , according to the state news agency			1
the moves comes amid uncertainty in @entity2 after foreign troops arrived to help the government quell weeks - long protests in the @entity77 kingdom			1
@entity32 and the @entity79 sent troops monday to " protect the safety of citizens , " the @entity2 government said			1
the troops arrived under the banner of the @entity35			0
but some in the capital city said tuesday that they did not need the added protection			0
" we do n't understand why these troops are coming in , " said a 28 - year - old blogger in @entity89			2
" we have an army and police			0
we do not need troops from other places			0
opposition leaders have called this an invasion			0
" the blogger also said he did not want to be named because of fears of retribution			0
one @entity32 soldier , an under - sergeant , was killed in @entity2 on tuesday , a @entity32 official said			1
the cause of the death was not immediately released			0
separately , a @entity2 police officer was killed in @entity7			1
a man from the town of @entity110 , who wanted to be identified only by his first name , said he feared that the troops would just inflame the already tense standoff			0
" i really hope things work , but i do n't think foreign troops will solve anything , " @entity114 said			0
" it will probably lead to more violence			0
" but a 25 - year - old banker from @entity89 said she welcomed the presence			2
" it gives us peace , " the woman said			0
" maybe these protests will finally end			0
these protesters say they are peaceful , but i have seen them carrying sticks and knives			0
they are blocking the streets so we can not get to work			0
they are criminals and this has gone on for too long			0
" the protests , which started february 14 , are part of a series of demonstrations that have swept across the @entity139 world this year , toppling the leaders of @entity141 and @entity53			0
but it was not clear whether any other country had taken the step of calling in foreign troops for help			0
" temporarily , it should calm the situation , " said @entity147 , director of the @entity77 and energy policy program at the @entity149			0
he noted that the @entity153 administration has been urging political dialogue but said monday 's move was not what the @entity41 president meant			2
" sending in @entity32 forces is hardly encouraging political dialogue , " @entity147 said			1
" the great danger is , it will actually worsen the situation by encouraging @entity163 to get involved			0
not militarily , probably , but certainly diplomatically and rhetorically			0
" the movement of forces came on the same day that protesters seized control of a key part of the capital city , @entity89 , a @entity165 official said			2
medical officials said that at least 36 people were injured in clashes monday , many of them wounded by projectiles from pellet guns			2
the @entity177 was still shut down tuesday morning , said @entity178 , a researcher with the group			0
but the extra troops were not visible in the city			0
" there are areas of the city that are being controlled by vigilante groups armed with sticks and batons			0
the patrols seem to be sectarian , " he said			0
" any time civilians take up arms and take matters into their own hands or threaten violence it is of great concern , " regardless of their political affiliation , @entity178 said			0
it was not clear how many foreign security troops had entered @entity2 in total			1
various parts of the @entity2 government referred questions to other government offices on monday			1
a witness said dozens of armored vehicles and buses full of soldiers crossed monday afternoon from @entity32 into @entity2 afternoon via the causeway linking the two countries			1
the @entity35 comprises six @entity211 -- @entity2 , @entity32 , @entity212 , the @entity79 , @entity213 and @entity214 -- and encourages cooperation among members in a number of areas , including the economy and security			1
the nation 's independent bloc of lawmakers called on @entity2 security forces to intervene to protect national security and stability , the @entity221 reported sunday			1
the bloc is composed of the 22 pro-government members of the lower house of the legislature			0
" extremist movements are resorting to escalation and sectarian mobilization , which led to an unprecedented disruption of security and hostile sectarian polarization at health and educational institutions , " the group said in a statement			0
on sunday , clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in the hospitalization of more than 1,000 people , human rights activists said			0
the unrest prompted the @entity50 to warn @entity41 to consider leaving the island nation			2
the @entity250 , too , has urged its residents not to travel there			0
" one thing is clear : there is no military solution to the problems in @entity2 , " @entity254 spokesman @entity253 said			1
" a political solution is necessary , and all sides must now work to produce a dialogue that addresses the needs of all of @entity2 's citizens			1
" @entity41 ambassador @entity263 is " working the issue aggressively on the ground as we speak , " the @entity254 said			0
last month , @entity41 president @entity153 welcomed plans by @entity67 to make changes to his cabinet and proceed with reforms			1
but a few days ago , @entity41 defense secretary @entity270 cautioned that " baby steps " would not be sufficient to meet protesters ' demands			0
@entity2 is the key banking and financial center in the @entity77			1
it also plays a crucial role in @entity41 defense interests in the region			0
the @entity279 is headquartered in @entity2 , and @entity2 is the only @entity139 state to have led one of the coalition task forces that patrol the @entity77			1
@entity41 military access to @entity2 also supports operations in @entity284			1
an underlying concern in this issue is that @entity163 , an overwhelmingly @entity287 state , could seize the opportunity to meddle in @entity2 's internal affairs			1
@entity2 has a @entity287 majority population , but its rulers are @entity292			1
on tuesday , an @entity163 @entity295 official criticized the arrival of @entity32 troops as an " invasion , " @entity163 's @entity293 reported monday			1
@entity32 's eastern province is home not only to many of the country 's rich oil fields but to its largest concentration of minority @entity287 as well			1
in recent weeks , @entity287 demonstrators there have protested the @entity32 government , whose leaders are overwhelmingly @entity292			2
the @entity32 government would presumably be concerned that any uprising by @entity287 in @entity2 could inspire the @entity287 population in nearby @entity32 to follow suit			1
during protests in @entity2 , moderates have been demanding a constitutional monarchy , and hard - liners have called for the abolition of the royal family altogether			1
but pro-government members of parliament have asked @entity67 to enforce a curfew and deploy security forces across the country , saying the protesters ' motives are far more sinister			2
" what we are witnessing in @entity89 is no peaceful protest , " @entity2 's foreign minister @entity326 said on @entity327			1
" it 's ( a ) wanton , gangster - style takeover of people 's lives			2
" @entity0 's @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			2

@entity57 says there is no military solution to @entity2 's unrest
