the @entity0 made a mistake			1
and they want to " get things right			0
" the two statements were repeated several times by owners and members of the team 's front office during a media day news conference wednesday , the first 20 minutes of which were dominated by questions about star running back @entity13 , who stands accused of felony child abuse in @entity15			1
" we made a mistake , and we needed to get this right , " co-owner @entity16 said			1
" our goal is to always make the decision we think is right			0
" after @entity16 left the podium , a reporter asked @entity16 's brother , co-owner @entity24 , general manager @entity24 and @entity25 , executive vice president of legal affairs , whether the team wanted to apologize to the boy that @entity13 is charged with abusing or the boy 's mother			1
there was a brief pause before @entity24 said , " again , our focus is to get things right , and we support @entity13			2
" the move to keep @entity13 " away from all team activities " marked a change in course for the @entity0 , which had earlier said that @entity13 would practice this week and could play in sunday 's game against the @entity39 @entity13 was placed on an exempt list , the team announced early wednesday , so that he can deal with the felony child abuse charge stemming from the june discipline of his son , whom @entity13 has said he never intended to injure			1
who put @entity13 on the list ? while there was some initial confusion as to whether the @entity0 placed him on the list or whether @entity13 made the decision , @entity24 clarified that at the news conference , explaining that only commissioner @entity50 can place a player on the @entity54 's exempt / commissioner 's permission list			1
@entity25 made it a point to emphasize that the discussion about revisiting @entity13 's situation began with the @entity0 , which conveyed its intentions to the @entity54			1
" this was a decision made by the @entity0 , " he said			1
@entity24 said he met with @entity13 on tuesday , and while he declined to discuss the specifics of that conversation , he said the running back was " unselfish " and wanted to step away to " give the @entity0 an opportunity to focus on football			1
" @entity13 will take a leave with pay until his legal issues are resolved			1
" this is a good decision that will allow @entity13 to resolve his personal situation and the @entity0 to return the focus to the football field , " @entity54 spokesman @entity70 said in an email to @entity72			1
the @entity78 explains the designation : " the exempt list is a special player status available to clubs only in unusual circumstances			0
the list includes those players who have been declared by the commissioner to be temporarily exempt from counting within the @entity84 limit			0
" only the commissioner has the authority to place a player on the @entity80 ; clubs have no such authority , and no exemption , regardless of circumstances , is automatic			0
the commissioner also has the authority to determine in advance whether a player 's time on the @entity80 will be finite or will continue until the commissioner deems the exemption should be lifted and the player returned to the @entity84			0
" in a statement released wednesday afternoon , @entity13 's attorney , @entity96 , said his client wanted to continue to contribute to his team and the community , but that was possible only by resolving his case through the legal system and not " the court of public opinion			1
" " ultimately , it will be up to a judge and jury to decide this case , which is the way it should be			0
ours is the greatest legal system in the world , and @entity13 is confident that a just result will emerge once all the facts are presented , " the statement said			1
decision rescinded though the team deactivated him for sunday 's game against the @entity118 , the @entity0 announced this week that @entity13 would return to practice and be allowed to play sunday			1
it was a short - lived decision , one the team would repeatedly call a mistake wednesday			2
" while we were trying to make a balanced decision ( monday ) , after further reflection we have concluded that this resolution is best for the @entity0 and for @entity13 , " said the wednesday statement from the @entity16 brothers			1
" we want to be clear : we have a strong stance regarding the protection and welfare of children , and we want to be sure we get this right			0
" @entity13 is considered one of the best running backs in the @entity54 -- if not the best			1
his absence was probably felt during the @entity0 ' 30 - 7 loss to the @entity118 on sunday			2
in 2011 , the @entity137 product agreed to a lucrative contract , which @entity54 reported would be worth $ 100 million over a seven - year period			0
but his fortunes have taken a turn for the worse since his indictment last week on a felony charge of causing bodily injury to his son			2
on tuesday , he lost one of his most significant endorsement deals when @entity148 , a major producer of motor oil , pulled out			0
@entity148 used @entity13 in commercials for its edge performance oil product and on social media			2
many recent social media posts of his likeness have been pulled down , and the commercials are no longer available on @entity156			0
his other major sponsor , @entity157 , said late last week it would stand by its athlete for the time being			0
one of the team 's sponsors , the @entity163 hotel chain , announced monday night that it was suspending its " limited sponsorship of the @entity0 while we evaluate the facts and circumstances			1
" also , the website for @entity13 's @entity171 was taken offline after the charities represented on the site received " harassing " calls from gossip sites , said his philanthropic adviser , @entity174			2
" we took the website offline because the charities that @entity13 supports were getting calls from the media and were getting harassed by the media , " @entity174 told @entity72			2
" i spoke to one communication director saying she had received about a dozen calls today from the same gossip site			0
" the allegations after his indictment last week , @entity13 turned himself in to @entity15 authorities saturday and was released on a $ 15,000 bond			2

photos obtained by @entity200 allegedly show @entity13 's son 's leg covered in marks that could have come from a switch , or thin tree branch			1
some of the marks in the photo appeared to have broken the skin			0
authorities have n't divulged the details of what led to the charge			0
but @entity13 's lawyer said the " charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son , " explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline much like " he experienced as a child growing up in east @entity15			1
" @entity13 and the false gospel of spanking @entity96 said that " @entity13 never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury			1
" @entity13 defended himself monday , saying he is " not a perfect parent , but i am , without a doubt , not a child abuser			1
" the developments came as @entity72 affiliate @entity229 reported this week that @entity13 allegedly abused another one of his children -- a 4 - year - old son			2
sources told @entity229 that the mother of the child filed a complaint with @entity236 in @entity15 because she alleged that @entity13 beat the child while he was visiting his father at his @entity240 - area home			2
according to the report , text messages between @entity13 and the boy 's mother show that @entity13 admitted disciplining the child , but he says the child hit his head on a car seat in the process			1
the cultural , regional and generational roots of spanking no charges were ever filed , according to @entity229			0
@entity72 reached out to @entity236 but has not received a response			0
@entity96 said @entity13 denied the report			2
" the allegation of another investigation into @entity13 is simply not true			0
this is not a new allegation			0
it 's one that is unsubstantiated and was shopped around to authorities in two states over a year ago , and nothing came of it , " @entity96 said			0
" an adult witness adamantly insists @entity13 did nothing inappropriate with his son			2
