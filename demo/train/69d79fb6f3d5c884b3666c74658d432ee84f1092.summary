-- hundreds of migrants departing from unstable @entity2 died in early october in a shipwreck while trying to reach @entity4 , their gateway to @entity7			1
but although their tale is tragic , it is far from exceptional			2
in the last two decades 20,000 people have perished from hypothermia , drowning , or landmines on the journey toward their " @entity7 dream			1
" and while @entity19 institutions are beginning to address this history of loss , it is crucial that the discussion on asylum , immigration , and borders be further democratized			2
@entity26 : how illegal immigrants enter the @entity19 these are defining moments shaping the future of @entity32 - @entity31 geopolitics , democracy , and human rights			2
members of the @entity36 recently adopted a joint resolution calling for a coordinated approach to immigration and asylum , to be inspired by both @entity42 solidarity and responsibility toward would - be migrants			2
seeking to prevent further disasters , the @entity19 's 28 heads of state have reached a consensus on the need to pursue activities that have long been in place			1
these include cracking down on organized crime ; boosting search and rescue and @entity55 border patrol activities ; implementing the @entity57 border surveillance system ; cooperating with countries of origin and transit ; collaborating with international agencies			1
additionally , a new task force for the @entity31 has been set up and is expected to offer operational proposals by december			0
immigration and asylum will again be discussed at the next @entity19 summit in june 2014 with possible legislative action at that time , when strategic guidelines " in the area of freedom , security and justice will be defined			0
" @entity74 prime minister @entity73 has also announced that his government is working on new national norms to regulate asylum			0
but he has dodged a crucial question -- whether forced migrants , including children , could be allowed to apply for temporary protection in @entity74 or elsewhere in @entity7 while still living in countries such as @entity2			1
as a clear political direction and " strategic guidelines " are still to emerge at the national and @entity19 level , civic engagement with these issues is vitally important			0
demographic and economic disparities between northern and southern @entity31 shores contribute to migration as an enduring condition			0
@entity92 boundaries between forced and economic migration are increasingly blurred as terrorism , corruption , border disputes , trafficking , drought , and sectarianism displace millions of people south and east of the @entity19			1
developing countries host 80 percent of the world 's refugees , with @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 hosting the largest numbers			1
in protracted refugee situations , such as that of @entity112 in @entity107 , children are born to refugees who themselves were born in refugee camps			1
opinion : @entity7 's immigration nightmare just beginning what all migrants have in common is the hope for a good life			1
and a good life , for most of them , is not merely about remittances , but also civic and political rights and duties , and belonging to a community that accepts them and their children for who they are and who they become			0
some are convinced @entity7 can offer this			0
opaque technocracy , abstract humanitarianism , and militarization alone can not provide answers to their plight -- answers must be political , and the @entity19 's discussion in this sense is only beginning			1
a democratized discussion on borders , asylum , and migration would need to include a more grounded assessment of the costs and benefits -- financial and in terms of human rights -- of colossal projects including @entity57 , @entity55 , and @entity154 to @entity156 countries such as @entity157 , the @entity158 , and @entity2			1
in the short term , small reallocations of the massive spending supporting these surveillance projects might enable the proliferation of initiatives akin to @entity106 's @entity165			1
this relatively modest , feasible program has recently flown to @entity106 in cooperation with the @entity168 for 5,000 @entity170 at - risk women and children , people with serious medical conditions , and survivors of torture			1
for two years they will be integrated into the socio - economic , healthcare , and educational fabric of @entity106 cities -- and the program may be extended beyond that timeframe			1
opinion : @entity19 must solve crisis to deserve @entity183 @entity19 institutions are also recommending migration management agreements between the @entity19 and transit countries			1
but several readmission agreements are already into force			0
they essentially oblige @entity156 signatories to take back not only their own citizens , but also third country nationals			0
in renewing or promoting such agreements , the @entity19 should better assess whether those countries offer a reliable state apparatus , a functioning asylum system , and the resources to adequately protect human rights			2
the @entity19 also needs to consider whether the youth in non-eu signatory countries will continue to experience these agreements as disparaging and humiliating , or as equitable and mutually beneficial			2
more broadly , @entity19 actors will have to decide whether the @entity31 is to serve as an integrated space of common growth or as an insurmountable frontier			0
both options have their costs			0
but in the latter case , everyone must appreciate the risk of more deaths at sea -- and billions of euros will need to be invested in permanent " military - humanitarian " operations			0
and despite the massive deployment of the " @entity217 " @entity74 military mission off @entity4 , transnational smuggler networks will look for other routes , as they have done for years , or alternatively bet precisely on patrol and rescue operations and ask inexperienced migrant themselves to take the helm of unseaworthy vessels			2
either way , they will profit by gambling with the lives of thousands of people			2
opinion : what 's the place of outsiders in @entity7 ? as consequential and costly decisions are being considered in @entity236 and other capitals it is time for citizens and leaders to make a choice as to how they envision national and @entity7 liberal democracy			2
what is the place of outsiders ? what is my legacy in writing the history of the present ? what will i say to the children of the drowned ? survivors , human rights advocates , pluralists , @entity255 , @entity256 , fiscal conservatives , post-colonial and " second generation " @entity7 need to speak out now , engaging each other and their representatives			0
i admit i am not a supporter of @entity7 right wing parties , and i do believe their growing popularity can not be challenged by merely adopting sanitized , " light " copies of their rhetoric			0
@entity271 and @entity19 politicians have to pragmatically tackle the serious challenges faced by their constituents			0
but they also have to more courageously explain what their vision of @entity7 is , accepting that in a functioning , non-demagogic democracy making everyone happy is impossible			0
and yes , the @entity19 has yet to win the hearts and minds of its citizens			0
it is precisely with our actions , relationships , voices , votes , and laws that we can help ground in democratic methods core @entity19 ideals of freedom , security , and justice			0
if we fail , the " @entity298 " will remain a scam marketed by smugglers and other dream dealers			1
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity301 .			1

@entity301 : 20,000 people have died in last 20 years trying to realize " @entity298 "
@entity305 : developing countries host 80 percent of the world 's refugees
failure to reform will ensure that " @entity298 " will remain a scam marketed by smugglers
