-- outside of superheroes , young adult adaptations have become one of the few thing studios can count on			1
from the " @entity8 " series ( $ 3.3 billion earned globally ) to " @entity5 " ( $ 7.7 billion total ) to " @entity10 " ( $ 1.5 billion worldwide so far ) , franchises based on popular books made for adolescents have turned into a safer gamble			2
with the alluring promise of an eager , built - in fanbase , even stand - alone @entity14 adaptations -- like " @entity15 , " which opened at no. 1 in june -- hold the potential to be deliciously lucrative			2
taking stock of the studio landscape , it is n't too surprising that " the giver 's " moment at the movies has finally come to pass			2
based on @entity27 's best - selling , award - winning 1993 novel , " @entity26 " actually struggled to make it into production , being ahead of its time with dystopian themes of an all - controlling government and a young boy who begins to rebel against it			1
that sounds de rigueur now , but in the ' 90s the book 's popularity was only eclipsed by its reputation among some as too disturbing for the classroom			0
@entity27 's story follows a 12 - year - old named @entity26 who is raised in what he believes is a utopia , a place where conformity is n't an option and being different can cost you your life			1
the residents ' world is void of color and strong emotion , but they also do n't suffer from war or pain , and have no memories to remind them of what they 're missing			0
grownups : do n't be ashamed of your @entity14 habit when @entity26 is elected to become the @entity66 , he learns from @entity26 -- the wizened , silver - haired gentleman seen gazing out from the book cover -- all that 's amiss in his world			1
@entity27 's tale resonated with actor @entity72 upon its release , and he initially pictured his father , @entity74 , playing the role of @entity26			1
but @entity74 ' road to getting the movie made turned out to be longer than he thought			0
according to @entity27 , @entity74 and his team first approached her about two years after " @entity26 " was published			1
" he was passionate about the book , " @entity27 said at the movie 's august 11 premiere in @entity82			0
" what sold me on it was his passion			0
i knew he would n't let the themes and ideas of the books be lost			0
" a brief history of young adult literature but the actor 's passion had to sustain him for 18 years as he lost the movie rights and regained them again			1
" originally i wanted to direct my father in the movie , and he is no longer with us , " @entity74 said of his dad , who died in 1998			0
" but i was originally inspired by this old grisly guy on the cover of @entity27 's book , and more and more i started to look like this old , grizzled guy , " the now - 64 - year - old continued			2
" and i thought , ' oh , maybe i can play this part , ' so i 'm just thrilled we put together this wonderful team and after 18 years we finally got it up on screen			1
" with @entity74 installed as @entity26 , the movie tapped @entity111 actor @entity110 to play @entity26 , who in the movie is already a teenager rather than on the cusp of becoming one			2
young adult books that changed our lives @entity26 ' older age is one of the tweaks the movie adaptation made to accommodate the story for the screen			1
for critics , the movie has n't exactly lived up to the book , but for @entity27 the movie 's right on time			0
" if they had made the movie 20 years ago , or even 18 years ago when they first optioned it , many things could n't have happened , " @entity27 said			1
" @entity72 was n't old enough to play the title role			2
some of the kids in the movie were n't even born and the technology was n't as good			0
they made a better movie because they waited			0
" @entity0 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

with young adult movies being popular , the *spotlight* now belongs to " @entity26 "
the 1993 novel was a *controversial* best - seller in its *day*
@entity72 , who was among its fans , saw it through to production across 18 years
