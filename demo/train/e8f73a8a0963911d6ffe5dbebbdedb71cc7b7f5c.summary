it was the government 's fault , contractors on the problem - plagued website for president @entity3 's signature health care reforms told a congressional hearing on thursday			1
in more than four hours of testimony before the @entity10 , officials of companies hired to create the @entity12 website cited a lack of testing on the full system and last - minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment system			1
angry exchanges between @entity19 who oppose @entity21 and @entity22 defending it erupted repeatedly , while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software buckled when the system went online on october 1			1
complaints about logging in , lengthy delays , incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have fueled continued @entity19 attacks on the @entity33 that was upheld by the @entity34 last year			2
the @entity36 and administration officials say the enrollment problems are being fixed			2
on thursday , the @entity38 and @entity39 ( @entity40 ) that oversees the new programs under the health care reforms said almost 700,000 applications have been submitted online on either the federal or state websites			2
while the applications do n't mean that many people have fully enrolled for health insurance under the new system , the figure represents a significant increase in those who have been able to start the process in recent days			1
however , @entity52 , the @entity40 director of communications , was unable to say how many of the 700,000 applications were submitted on the federal website			1
@entity52 seemed to agree with some of the criticism by contractors at the hearing , saying that " due to a compressed time frame , the system just was n't tested enough , especially for high volume			1
" @entity61 chairman @entity60 on thursday raised the threat of a possible subpoena if @entity65 secretary @entity64 does n't respond to his panel 's questions and requests for documents about problems with the @entity21 website			1
committee aides say @entity64 has failed to respond to a previous request and @entity60 is now giving her until monday to comply or possibly face " compulsory " action			1
at thursday 's hearing , committee chairman rep. @entity75 of @entity76 called the launch of the website " nothing short of a disaster , " noting that contractors at the hearing previously " looked us in the eye and assured us repeatedly that everything was on track , except that it was n't			1
" @entity75 and other @entity19 said it heralded problems with the rest of the @entity21 reforms			0
" i am more nervous today than i was when i got here , " @entity91 chairman @entity90 of @entity76 said of security concerns raised by thursday 's testimony , such as code changes being made to fix the problems without undergoing normal testing			1
democrats , however , accused @entity19 of continuing a campaign to sabotage the health care reforms instead of working to fix problems in the system intended to help millions of uninsured @entity103 obtain affordable health coverage			2
they noted that media headlines in 2006 blared similar descriptions of rollout problems with the @entity109 prescription drug reforms of the @entity111 administration , but that @entity22 then worked with republicans to resolve the issues instead of trying to scrap the legislation			0
" the @entity19 do n't have clean hands coming here			0
their effort is not to make things better , " said @entity22 rep. @entity116 of @entity117			0
" let the goal here be to fix it , not nix it			0
" in the first detailed account of what happened , officials of four contractors involved in the website creation described a convoluted system of multiple companies operating separately under the oversight of @entity40 , a part of the @entity65			1
each said their individual components generally performed as planned after internal testing , but all conceded that @entity40 failed to conduct sufficient " end - to - end " testing of the entire system before the launch			1
" the system did n't receive adequate end - to - end testing , " declared @entity141 of @entity142 , while @entity143 of @entity144 added " no one ever gets enough time for testing			1
" @entity143 , whose company has a contract worth a possible total of more than $ 200 million for its work on the system , noted than an end - to - end test conducted within two weeks of the launch caused the system to crash			2
she said it was up to @entity40 to decide on proceeding with the rollout			0
@entity141 , whose company stands to make up to $ 85 million for its work , acknowledged that unexpected volume at the start overwhelmed the " enterprise identity management " or @entity165 entry portal blamed for the initial blockages			1
he and @entity143 blamed a decision by @entity40 within two weeks of the launch to require users to fully register in order to browse for health insurance products , instead of being able to get information anonymously , as originally planned			0
while the technical change to require registration was easy , the result was a much greater burden on the system that it failed to handle , @entity141 and @entity143 said			0
insurers pledge to help solve website problems @entity52 of @entity40 called the change a business decision to ensure that users could fully enroll from the start			1
she blamed the initial problems of the website on " pent up consumer demand			2
" however , @entity141 of @entity142 said @entity40 was warned about the system 's problems ahead of the launch			2
that was enough for @entity19 rep. @entity191 of @entity192 to say : " the bottom line here is that @entity40 is responsible for this failure			0
" at the @entity36 , spokesman @entity196 told reporters on thursday that administration officials " did not anticipate , we did not know of the kind of problems that would take place beginning on october 1 until october 1 came and we saw these challenges			1
" he repeated the president 's insistence that the problems were being fixed , an assurance also provided by @entity52			0
" we increased our bandwidth by adding servers and improving site architecture			0
we 're continuing this work , " she said			0
" problems wtih our database and system synchronization also made it hard for visitors to initially create accounts			2
so we improved site architecture , substituted in hardware and optimized database inquiries			0
" @entity36 video makes @entity12 issues seem simple @entity64 offered a similar view while addressing reporters in @entity226 , acknowledging continued issues while insisting " fixes " are being instituted regularly to make things better			1
" it 's better today than it was on october 1 , but it 's a long way from perfect , " @entity64 said after visiting one of 17 call centers where some 10,000 representatives talk by phone or online with those asking about health plans			1
" and we are determined to make it perfect			0
" at the committee hearing , @entity143 of @entity144 said " the system is working , people are enrolling , but people will be able to enroll at a faster pace " as troubles get resolved			0
her company expects the online system to be able to enroll @entity103 seeking health insurance by january 1 , she added , rejecting media reports that software needs to be scrapped or that five million lines of code must be rewritten			2
@entity143 called the software program unprecedented , noting that " for the first time in history " it combines the process of enrolling and selecting health insurance with determining eligibility for government subsidies " all in one place			2
" @entity64 on the spot in @entity21 website fiasco to accentuate progress on the website , two @entity22 panel members said during the hearing that either they or their offices were able to use the website to determine health insurance options available to them on wednesday or thursday			1
however , republicans said they had failed to gain full access to the website despite repeated attempts and complained they hear similar stories from their constituents across the country			0
@entity278 : 5 surprises from @entity64 interview the @entity10 is n't the only one probing @entity21 in light of its issues			1
so , too , is the @entity284 and the @entity61			0
the latter sent an eight - page letter wednesday to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together @entity12 giving them two days to provide documents , meeting lists and all communications with the @entity3 administration on the project , committee spokeswoman @entity285 said			1
meanwhile , @entity19 sens. @entity294 of @entity295 and @entity296 of @entity297 sent a letter to 47 contractors on thursday also seeking extensive details of their work on the @entity21 website including all contracts and other information			2
congressional republicans have sought to undermine the health care reforms , trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying them a requirement for legislation to fund the government			0
@entity64 : website problems blindsided president the @entity36 has pushed back against @entity19 and some @entity22 who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond march 31 and / or a delay in penalties for those who do n't sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues			1
the @entity3 administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care , and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon			0
still , @entity65 spokeswoman @entity329 insisted " the individual mandate timing " -- i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by march -- " has not changed			0
... it was true this morning			0
" @entity335 pushes back on extending @entity21 deadline			0
