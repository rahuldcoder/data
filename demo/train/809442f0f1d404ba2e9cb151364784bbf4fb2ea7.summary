@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 military says a recent raid uncovered a detailed letter from an @entity7 in @entity1 militant to the group 's leader about how the insurgent network should continue to generate economic chaos and " psychological conflict " and must bear down against @entity4 - backed @entity15 militias			1
an @entity1 mother and daughter are helped tuesday after a car bombing in @entity19 blamed on @entity7 in @entity1			1
maj. gen. @entity20 told reporters at a news conference on wednesday about a letter to @entity24 , the head of @entity7 in @entity1 , from a militant named @entity26			1
the document was posted on the @entity29 web site			2
the sentiments reflect the tenacity of and continuing challenges posed by the predominantly @entity15 militant network believed to be responsible for bombings that erupted across @entity1 on tuesday			1
@entity20 said it " provides further evidence about the strategy and tactics of violence " the group is pursuing			0
@entity20 said a march 5 raid northwest of @entity0 resulted in three insurgents killed , including @entity26 , and three others captured			0
troops seized a suicide vest , computer material and a stack of documents , including the document from @entity50 -- who was believed to be from @entity53 province			2
@entity26 lays out a variety of tactics that militants should pursue			0
" we must always leave the enemy in psychological conflict " so that " they can never have stability , " according to the document			2
with such instability , they " will not all unite against us , " it adds			0
@entity20 said that while authorities are investigating tuesday 's bombings in @entity0 , @entity68 , @entity69 , and @entity19 that killed 60 people and wounded more than 100 others , the strikes have the " hallmark " of being perpetuated by @entity7 in @entity1			1
the group has been considered the coalition 's top foe in @entity1 , even though troops have been distracted in recent weeks by fighting rogue @entity78 militias			1
@entity7 in @entity1 has been described by military officials as having a largely foreign leadership but made up of @entity1			1
it is distinct from @entity7 in @entity82 and @entity83 , but it is not clear how closely both the @entity1 and the @entity86 groups cooperate			1
the letter details the need for fostering " security chaos " among the anti-al @entity7 in @entity1 and mostly @entity15 awakening groups , @entity78 and @entity91 , the coalition forces , and the government			1
" this will lead to weaken them , particularly the @entity99 government , by wisely , intelligently and cautiously spreading sedition among them , " the letter said , referring to prime minister @entity95			2
in the letter , @entity26 considers awakening groups a top threat to @entity7 in @entity1 and proposes a media campaign that would discredit the awakening forces by passing along false information about them			1
the jihadi says @entity7 in @entity1 militants should consider infiltrating the government and security forces to foster trust			1
that atmosphere would enable militants to conduct attacks , including strikes against @entity78			0
" we will work against them and attack them as they fight among themselves , " @entity26 is quoted as saying			2
@entity26 also calls for the disrupting the economy by attacking gas and oil fields , pipelines , tankers , electric stations and power lines			0
he suggests contaminating water lines and lakes			0
such sabotage would serve to " halt payment of the military and police salaries and the awakening movement associated with the occupier and @entity95 's malignant government			0
even the @entity137 will weaken since it depends on the @entity1 oil and gas wealth			1
the enemy will gradually drown step by step			0
" @entity26 talks about the need to " bring many brothers who have sharia knowledge and abide by the teachings of @entity146 from the outside of @entity1			2
" " they will explain to the people why we are fighting and whom we are fighting with , we must explain to them whom the mujahideen are and who are the people we 're fighting			0
" the militant also called for good protection of communities under their control			2
" we must dig trenches around the villages and cities to prevent the enemy from entering our areas , " the document said			0
@entity26 also called for organizing fighting groups by having an emir as commander with sniper , assassination and martyrs ' groups			0
it also cautions vigilance against allowing the " enemy " to infiltrate its apparatus and exhorts its fighters to keep silent about operations			1
sometimes , " they speak of our operations and area 's secrets among their families and their wives in their houses , which unfortunately lead to the spread of our secrets			0
