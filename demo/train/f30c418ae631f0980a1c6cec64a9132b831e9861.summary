conflicting reports have emerged over who is in control in @entity6 , the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between @entity31 forces and insurgents during the @entity33			1
some suggest the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , formerly the group commonly known as @entity11 in @entity2 , is in partial control of @entity6 , which is situated roughly 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) west of @entity38 , in the volatile province of @entity40			1
the government said this weekend that the @entity2 army shelled @entity6 in an effort to clear out the @entity11 - linked fighters			1
the recent fighting in @entity40 , whose population is predominantly @entity48 , has posed a serious challenge to @entity1 and his @entity51 - dominated government			2
it has raised questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency			0
no @entity31 troops @entity31 secretary of state @entity59 said sunday that the @entity31 will help the @entity2 government in the battle against @entity11 - linked fighters in western @entity2 , but stressed it wo n't send troops			1
" we 're not contemplating putting boots on the ground , " @entity59 said in @entity65 during a visit to the @entity67			0
" this is their fight , but we 're going to help them in their fight			0
" @entity31 military forces , which invaded @entity2 and toppled the @entity78 regime in 2003 , fought insurgents there for years until they withdrew at the end of 2011			1
@entity31 officials say they are keeping a close eye on the current unrest			2
" this situation remains fluid , and it is too early to tell or make conclusions about it , " @entity85 press secretary @entity84 said monday			0
" but we are accelerating our foreign military sales deliveries and are looking to provide an additional shipment of hellfire missiles as early as this spring			2
" vice president @entity93 spoke with @entity1 by phone on monday and stressed that " the @entity31 stands with @entity2 " in the battle against the @entity11 - linked fighters , the @entity85 said			1
@entity93 also spoke to @entity97 , the speaker of the @entity98			2
@entity59 : we 'll help @entity2 but wo n't send in troops @entity48 ire in @entity40 the current conflict in @entity40 is not a simple matter of @entity11 against pro-government troops , according to local officials , political analysts and tribal leaders in @entity6 and @entity107			1
they say @entity1 is spinning the strife to his political advantage			2
these sources say @entity1 is trying to cite @entity11 as a pretext to crush @entity48 protesters and is using the same tack to get international support for his fight			1
they say he 's trying to create the false impression that @entity36 fighters control much of @entity6			2
@entity36 has been working doggedly to exploit a security vacuum across @entity2			0
while there are pockets of @entity11 - linked militants in @entity40 cities such as @entity6 , most regions in @entity40 , including @entity6 , are under the control of local police and @entity48 tribes not aligned with militants , they explained			1
@entity129 also has raged between these local tribes and the @entity2 army in @entity6			2
violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a @entity48 lawmaker in @entity107 and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in @entity6 and @entity107			0
most @entity48 in @entity40 have simply been angry at being regarded as second - class citizens in the majority @entity51 country			0
they have been upset with the local and central government authorities , and these grievances have spurred an ongoing uprising against the @entity51 - led government			0
echoes of earlier conflict things are a bit more stable in @entity107 , @entity40 's capital , because the local government struck a deal with tribes to fight against @entity36			0
@entity1 is more supportive of local government in @entity107 than @entity6 , according to these sources			1
soldiers have not been stationed inside @entity40 cities for nearly a year			0
now , @entity1 is trying to bring the soldiers back , a move prompting @entity48 resistance			0
the deal the government made with some @entity48 tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 @entity31 pact that saw @entity48 turn on @entity11 , siding with @entity31 and @entity2 forces to bring about an end to the terrorism			1
the fighting between @entity48 militants against @entity51 - dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the @entity33 in 2006 and 2007 , when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart			0
the analysts who spoke to @entity0 said that @entity51 have more to fear in the conflict with @entity48 because they risk losing their newfound and widespread power after decades of domination by a largely @entity48 regime led by @entity78			0
