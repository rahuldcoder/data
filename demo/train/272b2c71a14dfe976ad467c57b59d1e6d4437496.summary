angry @entity1 mobs are n't putting away the pitchforks yet			1
the company said monday that it would kill its spinoff , @entity5 , only a month after it was announced			1
that did little to placate consumers who are still fuming about price increases the company announced in july and who are starting to see @entity1 as a once - innovative service that 's lost its way			1
" @entity1 does more flip - flopping than a fish on a hot dock , " a @entity14 user named @entity15 wrote			1
" @entity1 's approval rating is so low right now it could run for president , " @ @entity19 said			1
" i do n't think this fixes anything , " said @entity22 , a 37 - year - old in @entity24			0
" this will make people realize how right they were to leave them			0
now they 're just back - pedaling			0
" " i do n't feel the need to go back when they 've already made too many changes too fast , " said @entity30 , a 21 - year - old in @entity32			0
the company 's public relations nightmare began in july , when @entity1 announced that it would stop offering free streaming video services to households that paid for its dvd - by - mail service			1
that raised monthly prices by 60 % for some customers , without any improvement in the service			2
then @entity1 said in september that it was splitting its dvd and streaming services into two companies : @entity5 and @entity1			1
that incensed some already - angry customers , since they now would have to deal with two corporations instead of one			0
and , finally , on monday the company pulled a 180 - degree - turn			1
" it is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult , so we are going to keep @entity1 as one place to go for streaming and dvds , " ceo @entity54 said in a blog post			2
" this means no change : one website , one account , one password ... in other words , no @entity5			2
" actually , that puts @entity1 back at square two -- before the @entity5 fiasco , but with price hikes			1
since all of the whiplash changes started , @entity1 has lost an estimated 1 million customers -- possibly more			1
an earnings call on october 24 is expected to reveal details about how monday 's changes affected the company 's customer base			2
it 's clear investors do n't like all this back - and - forth			0
the company 's stock closed down nearly 5 % by the end of monday			2
since mid-july , it 's fallen about 60 %			0
not all consumer reaction to @entity1 's decision to kill @entity5 was negative , however			1
@entity90 , a 26 - year - old in @entity91 , @entity92 , said he was going to quit the service until he heard about monday 's announcement			0
" it 's the right move , not only because of the silly name of @entity5 , but it was just going to be such a huge pain to manage two separate companies that were doing the same thing , " he said			1
" nobody wants to have to manage two different queues and pay two different bills for something that we 're doing all together now			0
" the company does seem to have lost its way , he said			0
" they 're being really reactionary at this point , and that 's not very comforting			0
" others cut the company a bit more slack			0
" as long as @entity1 continues to function for a reasonable price i do n't have reason 2 abandon it , " a @entity14 user named @ @entity114 wrote			2
" wish they 'd focus though			0
