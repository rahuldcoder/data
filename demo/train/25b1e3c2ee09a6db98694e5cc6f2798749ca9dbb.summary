-- on june 13 , 2009 , hundreds of thousands took to the streets in the largest demonstrations seen in @entity4 since the @entity6 revolution of 1979			1
they were protesting what many observers said was a rigged presidential election			0
the regime answered with brutal repression			0
security forces admitted 2,000 arrests and some 20 killings			0
families of the protesters insisted that the true number of the killed was hundreds more			0
through the crisis , president @entity18 mostly held his tongue			1
on june 15 , he disavowed any intention by the @entity22 to favor one side or the other			1
he assured @entity22 that the @entity6 government had promised him " that they are going to look into irregularities that have taken place			1
" only on june 23 , after 10 days of arrests , beatings , and killings , did @entity18 harden his tone			1
that day , he expressed disapproval of the regime 's " threats , beatings and imprisonments			0
" yet even that tougher statement was hedged with careful restraints			0
while deploring loss of life , the president avoided any suggestion that the regime had intentionally killed anyone			0
by then , of course , the " irregularities " had achieved their effect : the protests were suppressed , the election was stolen			0
by crushing protesters in 2009 , the @entity6 regime survived to aid its clients in @entity55 when they faced an uprising in 2011			1
@entity6 generals and @entity59 militias stiffened @entity55 government forces and turned the tide of war -- a war that has to date claimed perhaps 150,000 lives -- and generated the largest refugee exodus in @entity67 history			1
in august 2011 , @entity18 called upon president @entity68 to step down			1
in august 2012 , @entity18 declared the use of poison gas a " red line			1
@entity22 presidents should use the language of command only very sparingly -- but when they do use it , they can not allow their commands to be defied with impunity			1
yet that , to the world 's cost , is precisely what happened			0
@entity72 used poison gas in december 2012			0
rather than react , the @entity22 government pooh - poohed the reports			1
" the reporting we have seen from media sources regarding alleged chemical weapons incidents in @entity55 has not been consistent with what we believe to be true about the @entity55 chemical weapons program			1
" within hours , the @entity94 soft line had been contradicted by a leaked cable from @entity22 officials on the @entity98 - @entity55 border			1
the @entity18 administration seemed to take the view : if we see something , we 'll have to do something			1
we do n't want to do anything , so we wo n't see anything			0
@entity72 did not cooperate , however			0
he used poison gas again , in attacks of escalating deadliness , through the spring of 2013			0
@entity18 threatened military action -- and again nothing much happened			1
a @entity113 plan to deactivate @entity55 weapons has bogged down , with the @entity55 gaining extensions and more extensions			2
as of march 2014 , @entity55 still retained a majority of its original chemical stockpile			2
in the meanwhile , the government continues to gain the upper hand over the rebels			0
did @entity68 's successful crossing of @entity18 's red line embolden another @entity68 ally , @entity113 's @entity125 ? over the past six months , the sovereign state of @entity127 -- a country of 50 million -- has chased out a corrupt authoritarian @entity113 - backed president and attempted to reorient itself to @entity131 and the @entity132			1
@entity113 has invaded and annexed the @entity127 territory of @entity134 -- the first time since 1945 that a larger @entity131 country has taken territory from a smaller			1
the @entity22 response has again been muted			2
@entity18 's most recent statement about @entity127 , delivered in @entity131 on march 26 , belittled the significance of what has happened there			1
" to be honest , if we define our -- our interests narrowly , if we applied a cold - hearted calculus , we might decide to look the other way			0
our economy is not deeply integrated with @entity127 's			2
our people and our homeland face no direct threat from the invasion of @entity134			0
our own borders are not threatened by @entity113 's annexation			0
" he concluded : " now is not the time for bluster			0
the situation in @entity127 , like crises in many parts of the world , does not have easy answers nor a military solution			2
" meanwhile , in @entity164 , another authoritarian regime is violently suppressing student protesters			2
@entity164 , too , seems to have got the message : all clear , nothing to fear from @entity94			2
the president 's response ? a four - sentence statement delivered at a press conference in @entity172 back in february that seemed to lay blame on all parties			0
" i want to take this opportunity to address the situation in @entity164 and @entity127 , and the unacceptable violence in those two countries , which the @entity22 strongly condemns			1
" in @entity164 , rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the @entity22 , the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the @entity164 people			1
so , along with the @entity188 , we call on the @entity164 government to release protesters that it 's detained and engage in real dialogue			2
and all parties have an obligation to work together to restrain violence and restore calm			0
" in crisis after crisis , the @entity22 seems just awol			2
and there 's an emerging pattern to this passivity : all four of these cases -- @entity6 , @entity55 , the @entity113 invasion of @entity134 and @entity164 -- involve governments in which @entity18 tried to engage in dialogue			1
in each case , the government in question preferred violent repression to dialogue			0
and in each case , the violently repressive government got away with its actions , leaving the @entity22 and its eloquent president defied , outmaneuvered and tongue - tied			1
the @entity134 situation is n't over yet			0
but it does seem likely to follow the same path as the other cases			0
the pattern established here is embarrassing to the @entity22 and destabilizing to the world			2
@entity18 blames his predecessor as too provocative			2
but , as the saying goes , weakness is provocative , too			0
by that measure , the @entity22 has seldom provoked more trouble than it is provoking today .			1

@entity227 : time after time , president @entity18 has ducked *foreign* *policy* *challenges*
he says the president *declined* to be forceful on @entity6 , @entity55 , @entity127 , @entity164
@entity232 : is @entity18 projecting @entity22 weakness ? and is that provoking others to act ?
