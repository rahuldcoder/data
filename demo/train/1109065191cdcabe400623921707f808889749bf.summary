-- back in the 1950s , @entity1 fell in love with the idea of truth serum			1
all manner of spies , murderers and other bad guys were given a needle containing sodium pentothal on the big screen and soon were babbling away uncontrollably as to their guilt or complicity with @entity15 or the @entity16			1
as recently as 2004 in " meet the @entity20 , " a former @entity18 agent played by @entity19 injects his would - be son - in - law , played by @entity22 , with the stuff to get the lowdown on his love life			0
@entity22 's character confesses , in a foreshadowing of @entity29 's amorous ways , to having had a child with his housekeeper , although whether he did or not is far from clear			0
@entity32 knew all about truth serum			1
@entity34 was used on a variety of miscreants and by evildoers			0
it was so powerful and feared that its use was strictly controlled by the @entity41			0
in reality , magical thinking is all it really is			0
there is no such thing as truth serum			1
but that news has apparently not reached @entity48			0
the judge in charge of the mass murder trial of @entity52 seems to think @entity1 was onto something with its fascination with truth serums			1
he has approved the use of a " narcoanalytic interview " -- such as a " truth serum " like sodium pentothal -- as part of a competency evaluation to determine whether @entity52 was legally insane at the time he allegedly went on a rampage in a theater in @entity64 , @entity48			1
@entity52 is charged with killing 12 people and injuring many more			2
sodium pentothal -- the original " truth serum " -- was discovered in 1936 by @entity69 and @entity70 working in @entity71 at @entity72			1
they were trying to create an injectable drug for use in general anesthesia			2
their discovery was a success and had a huge impact on surgery			0
sodium pentothal is still used today to knock out patients before they are given another , longer - lasting anesthetic to keep them unconscious during surgery			1
sodium pentothal made surgery far less painful			1
it also has an interesting side effect			0
people under its influence lose their inhibitions and babble on about all sorts of things , leading to some amusing moments for surgical teams			0
this loss of inhibition gave a few researchers hope that the drug or something like it could be used to get the truth out of people in police stations , security interrogations or trials			2
but outside of @entity1 , no drug passes muster as a potion capable of getting accurately at the truth			1
people do get uninhibited and talk more freely , but they do n't necessarily stop lying or fantasizing			0
they also grow more compliant , tending to agree with those asking them leading questions			0
there is no solid evidence that what is said under the influence of a " truth " drug correlates reliably with the truth			2
for the most part , people yammer away			0
if anything , they behave as if they were drunk rather than diligently affirming the sober truth			0
there is no drug that is going to shed trustworthy light on @entity52 ' state of mind last year when , police say , he donned a gas mask as well as full body armor and grabbed a rifle , a pump - action 12 - gauge shotgun and at least one .40 - caliber semiautomatic pistol to launch a heinous attack			1
no drug can tell us what he was really thinking			0
in giving permission to use drugs , the judge has opened the door to a line of defense in which @entity52 ' lawyers can argue that if drugged , he is being forced to testify against himself against his will			1
as much as some might hope for a thing such as a truth serum , none exists			2
whether @entity52 was bad or mad when he allegedly caused so much misery to so many people will not get resolved by a technique beloved by @entity1 movie directors but not by scientists			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

judge in @entity64 shootings approved use of drugs for competency evaluation
@entity159 : no drug can shed light on mindset of shooting *suspect* @entity52
he says " truth serum , " or sodium pentothal , is used as anesthesia for surgeries
@entity159 : only @entity1 likes the idea of " truth serum , " not scientists
