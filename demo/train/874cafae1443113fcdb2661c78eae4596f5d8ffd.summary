@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's known to generations of football fans simply as @entity6 , the hard - nosed @entity8 football coach who peers through his trademark thick eyeglasses and sees something more in the young men he coaches -- and demands they see it , too			1
but @entity6 's stellar reputation has been muddied over reports of his reaction to a years - ago child sex abuse case , and he has lost his job after 46 years as a head coach			2
the university trustees unanimously voted to fire the iconic sports figure wednesday night			1
@entity24 defensive coordinator @entity23 will serve as interim head coach			0
@entity26 , the college president , was fired as well			0
national outrage has percolated over @entity6 's reaction to a graduate assistant 's 2002 report that he had seen former @entity8 defensive coordinator @entity31 performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex			1
@entity1 attorney general @entity36 said monday that @entity6 is not a target of the investigation , which has resulted in charges against two top university officials accused of failing to report the abuse , in addition to @entity31			1
but critics have said the coach should have reported the suspected abuse to police			0
@entity6 , 84 , said on sunday that he 'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss			1
he said he had done " what i was supposed to do			0
" in a later statement , he said " with the benefit of hindsight , i wish i had done more			0
" @entity31 , who was arrested saturday , is accused of sexual offenses , child endangerment and " corruption of a minor " involving eight boys , most or all of whom he met through @entity59 , the charity he founded to help troubled youth , prosecutors said			1
" we do n't yet know who is legally guilty , " @entity67 columnist @entity66 writes			0
" but several prominent employees at the state university are morally guilty			0
and one of them is @entity6			2
" @entity6 has earned a reputation not only as a football wizard -- he 's won more games than any other major - school coach -- but for his focus on academics and civics			2
he began his career at @entity8 in 1950 as a 23 - year - old assistant under head coach @entity83			2
sixteen years later , he took the reins of the @entity24 football program , beginning a head coaching career that has netted him 409 wins , five undefeated seasons , two national titles and a spot in the @entity91			0
he also put a premium on academic achievement			0
@entity6 contributed $ 3.5 million to the university in 1998 , endowing faculty positions in liberal arts , architecture , landscape architecture and the university 's library system , according to his biography			2
he also helped fund an interfaith spiritual center and a sports museum			0
he also has challenged his own athletes to succeed academically			0
his 2009 team had an 89 % graduation rate , and his teams have produced dozens of academic award and scholarship winners , according to his bio			0
" coach @entity6 was absolutely instrumental in my life in showing me and teaching me that there are no cutting corners , " @entity111 , who played quarterback at @entity8 in the late 1980s and early 1990s , told @entity2 in 2004			1
@entity6 became embroiled in the @entity31 saga when , in 2002 , a graduate assistant came to him to report a disturbing scene he had witnessed the night before , according to a grand jury report released last week			1
according to the report , the assistant told @entity6 that he saw @entity31 in the shower with a boy who looked to be about 10 years old			1
@entity31 was having sex with the child , according to the grand jury report and prosecutors			1
the distraught assistant ran from the building and called his father , who advised him to report the incident to @entity6 , according to the grand jury and prosecutors			1
the next day , @entity6 passed the report up to his boss , athletic director @entity135 , saying -- according to the grand jury report -- that the graduate assistant had told him he had seen @entity31 " fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy			1
" the reports never made it to police			0
@entity135 and another university official who learned of the 2002 incident , senior vice president for finance and business @entity145 , have been charged with failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading the grand jury investigating @entity31 's conduct			1
in his sunday statement , @entity6 said he did his duty in referring the allegations to his superior but said the assistant never " related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report			2
" " if this is true we were all fooled , along with scores of professionals trained in such things , and we grieve for the victims and their families , " he said in the statement			0
@entity168 , in an @entity67 column , pondered what he sees as @entity6 's complex legacy			2
" no question , @entity6 should be held accountable for his inaction in the @entity31 saga -- as should a whole lot of other people who had a chance to stop this tragedy			1
it would be an injustice to the alleged victims to ever forget @entity6 's failure to prevent future crimes			1
but it would also be a disservice to the thousands upon thousands of lives he positively impacted if that mistake erases 46 years of good from the history books			0
" we will remember @entity6 both as the coach who we thought served as a moral standard - bearer for 40 - plus years and as the coach who bore responsibility for a reprehensible moral breakdown at the end			2
those memories are not mutually exclusive			0
" as for @entity8 itself , @entity198 , a columnist with the @entity199 , said the fallout from the " @entity31 bombshell remains inestimable , particularly at its far horizons			1
" " years of criminal and civil litigation await the university 's soon - to - be - overburdened attorneys , by just one example , and predicting what the institution will come to look like in the @entity209 strains the imagination , " wrote @entity198			0
" whatever its future , it 's probably better than that of some still untold number of young boys who suffered soul - scorching sexual abuse that @entity8 's top leadership allegedly could have prevented had it only the standard human apportionment of moral courage			0
you can paint over @entity31 's image on a @entity0 mural , as an artist did wednesday , but no artistic flourish or inspiration can begin to cover the psychological destruction he 's alleged to have wrought			1

new : @entity6 was fired wednesday night
new : for @entity8 , the fallout " remains inestimable "
