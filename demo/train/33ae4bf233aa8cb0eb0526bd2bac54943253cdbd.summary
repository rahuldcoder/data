-- @entity2 amateur golfer @entity1 was not even born when @entity3 won the masters for the first time in 1997			1
@entity1 will become the youngest player in @entity8 history when he tees off on thursday , eclipsing the mark set by @entity11 's @entity10 in 2010 and on monday , the @entity2 teenager -- aged 14 years , five months and 14 days -- was given a helping hand by @entity3 after the 14 - time major winner invited @entity1 to take in the back nine of the fabled @entity16 course			1
@entity1 qualified for the year 's first major by winning november 's @entity18 , an event designed specifically to unearth global talent			2
it was the third time the teenager had played with world no. 1 woods , with the pair joined on their monday practice round by big - hitting @entity27 @entity26			0
" he gives me advice and i will say every time i play with him i feel a lot better and give myself confidence , " @entity1 told the @entity29 's official website			1
" i 'm not going to push myself too hard			0
i 'm trying to just enjoy my game , play my best and hopefully play a good score			0
" woods , who goes into this weekend 's tournament as favorite to clinch a fifth @entity8 crown , is pleased his legacy has helped created a new generation of players			0
opinion : for @entity3 , winning does take care of everything " it 's frightening to think that he was born after i won my first masters , " the 37 - year - old said after winning the @entity53 a few weeks ago			0
" it 's exciting that i 've inspired kids to play and not just here in the @entity27 , but obviously in @entity2 and around the world			2
" at the other end of the age scale , @entity60 , aged 44 , was hoping to take part in his 12th masters			0
but the 2011 @entity64 champion has been forced to withdraw with the same hamstring injury which kept him out of last week 's @entity66			1
@entity60 was one of @entity68 's vice captains when he led @entity69 to a stunning @entity71 victory against the @entity27 at @entity72 in september			1
meanwhile @entity73 's @entity68 , a two - time champion at @entity16 , hit a wayward drive during the first day of practice which left a male spectator with blood pouring from his head			1
@entity68 , the last @entity69 to wear the green jacket , immediately apologized and offered the stricken fan a signed glove			2
