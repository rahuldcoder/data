-- @entity1 expanded the digital world of cloud computing on tuesday , announcing the rollout of " @entity5			1
" the service , which will give users @entity8 of free remote storage and additional space for a monthly fee , puts the web giant in competition with @entity14 and @entity15 , as well as specialized services like @entity17 and @entity18 , in a space that increasingly looks like the future of computing			1
" this is really just the next step in the evolution of @entity25 , " @entity22 , group product manager for @entity5 , told @entity0			2
" it 's really letting people live more in the cloud by connecting them more easily with all the devices they have			0
" @entity25 already lets users store e-mail and other documents			0
cloud computing allows users to store documents and files , even large ones , on remote servers			0
its promise is to make storage space on physical hard drives less important , as well as making it easier to seamlessly share , either with others or between multiple devices like laptops , phones and tablets			0
" @entity5 is everywhere you are -- on the web , in your home , at the office and on the go , " reads @entity1 's promotional page for the service			1
" so wherever you are , your stuff is just ... there			0
ready to go , ready to share			0
" @entity5 will launch with an @entity58 app for smartphones and tablets running @entity1 's mobile operating system and in conjunction with 20 third - party apps			1
as one might expect with a @entity1 product , a big feature of @entity5 is a search feature that will allow users to comb through more than 30 types of files , such as @entity1 docs or pdfs			1
there 's also a limited image - search feature , driven by @entity75 technology , that can recognize famous faces and landmarks , such as @entity78			0
the service will immediately be available for pcs and @entity81 , as well as @entity58			0
@entity83 and @entity84 availability is promised soon			0
users may upgrade to @entity86 of storage for as little as $ 2.50 a month , @entity1 says			1
as more computer users are accessing the @entity90 or doing work on multiple devices , cloud storage has rapidly evolved as a popular alternative to hard drives			2
just this week , @entity15 expanded its @entity96 product , offering up to @entity97 of storage and adding access for the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity100 phones			2
@entity14 's @entity102 service has been available since last june and , according to @entity14 , has more than 100 million users			1
and @entity18 , the leading independent cloud - storage service , reportedly has racked up another 50 million			1
some observers are dinging @entity1 for being late to expand its cloud offerings			2
" @entity5 is a late entrant to the file sharing space and is no doubt a direct response to the success and popularity that consumer file sync services are experiencing , " said @entity108 , vice-president of data - sharing at @entity110			2
" the addition of @entity5 to the cloud storage landscape will make it even more competitive but with @entity14 , @entity122 and @entity15 having offered services for some time , most providers have already got used to swimming with sharks and not getting eaten			1
" but others say that with a player as major as @entity1 , even a late entrance in the market will have an impact			0
" @entity5 is significant because now all @entity1 account holders have one click signup to free file storage , sync and sharing , which has the potential to quickly build a large volume of users , " said @entity130 analyst @entity129			1
" integration with @entity141 / @entity140 and eventually with @entity142 will make it more natural and seamless than managing from a separate account ... so , @entity5 will cause more individuals to begin using personal cloud services and more companies , those that use @entity148 , to use cloud - based file sync and sharing			2
" @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this story .			0
