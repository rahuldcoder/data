-- " you did n't build that			1
" that july comment by president @entity4 was the cornerstone of this year 's @entity6			1
@entity7 have seized on the phrase -- a seemingly stray clause in a line @entity4 delivered at a campaign stop in @entity12 -- as a kind of @entity15 slip that reveals the president 's hostility to free enterprise			1
the statements : the phrase " we built it " was the backdrop for speaker after speaker during tuesday night 's convention proceedings , and speakers have invoked it to paint @entity4 as an out - of - touch , big - government liberal			1
" that makes me think that @entity4 has a problem with the @entity30 , " @entity7 chairman @entity27 said tuesday			1
" he said , ' you did n't build it			1
' translation : ' it does n't rightly belong to you , ' " former @entity38 governor and 2008 presidential hopeful @entity33 chimed in wednesday			1
house speaker @entity39 delivered what may have been the most epic recounting of the line , putting it in the context of his family 's @entity45 tavern : " now , let 's say a guy walked into our bar , and before he could say anything , he overheard a regular telling his story , " @entity39 said tuesday night			1
" turns out this guy ran a small business , got involved in it while he was in school			2
then , out of nowhere , his business partner died			2
they had just one customer			0
so he fought like hell through sleepless nights and close calls ... now , if a guy walked into a bar and heard that story , and he said , ' well , if you 've got a business , you did n't build that , ' well , you know what we 'd do with him , do n't you ? we 'd throw him out			1
" vice presidential nominee @entity73 invoked it in his acceptance speech wednesday , praising small business owners who show up " to open the door at 5 in the morning			0
" " nobody did their thinking , and worrying , and sweating for them , " @entity73 said			0
" after all that work , and in a bad economy , it sure does n't help to hear from their president that government gets the credit			1
what they deserve to hear is the truth : yes , you did build that			1
" the clips that ran between speakers at the @entity7 convention took things further , heavily editing @entity4 's remarks to set up television - ready vignettes with business owners who took umbrage at the comment			1
" look , if you 've been successful , you did n't get there on your own			1
you did n't get there on your own			2
i 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because i was just so smart			0
there are a lot of smart people out there			0
it must be because i worked harder than everybody else ... if you 've got a business -- you did n't build that			1
somebody else made that happen , " was what delegates heard over the @entity123 system			0
fact check : trimming the @entity126 the facts : @entity4 's remark came at a july 13 speech at a firehouse in @entity131 , @entity12 , where he attacked @entity6 opposition to his economic plans and defended the role of government in promoting economic growth			1
it is true that he used the phrase , " you did n't build that			1
" here is the full text : " look , if you 've been successful , you did n't get there on your own , " he said			2
" you did n't get there on your own			2
i 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because i was just so smart			0
there are a lot of smart people out there			0
it must be because i worked harder than everybody else			0
let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there			0
" if you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help			2
there was a great teacher somewhere in your life			0
somebody helped to create this unbelievable @entity167 system that we have that allowed you to thrive			0
somebody invested in roads and bridges			0
" if you 've got a business -- you did n't build that , " he continued			1
" somebody else made that happen			0
the @entity176 did n't get invented on its own			2
government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet			0
the point is , is that when we succeed , we succeed because of our individual initiative , but also because we do things together			0
there are some things , just like fighting fires , we do n't do on our own			2
" so there it is			0
everything before and after " you did n't build that " refers to infrastructure , education and public services			1
@entity4 released a rebuttal to the criticism within two weeks of his @entity131 appearance			1
in a television spot , the president tells viewers , " of course @entity167 build their own business			2
everyday hardworking people sacrifice to meet a payroll , create jobs , and make our economy run			0
and what i said was that we need to stand behind them , as @entity167 always has			0
by investing in education , training , roads and bridges , research and technology			0
" he called ads that used the edited version of his remarks " flat - out wrong			0
" fact check : most @entity167 think today 's kids will do worse ? the conclusion : it 's a classic example of a remark being taken out of context			1
@entity0 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			2

@entity4 's " you did n't build that " line was the heart of the @entity7 convention attack
