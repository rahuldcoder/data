-- missile and launch components have been moved to the east coast of @entity8 in the " last few days , " a @entity2 official with direct knowledge of the information told @entity0 thursday			1
the apparent deployment comes amid further threatening statements by @entity8 and heightened tensions in the region -- a situation that " does not need to get hotter , " a @entity10 spokeswoman said			1
the move of the missile and launch equipment could mean that @entity19 , which unleashed another round of scathing rhetoric accusing the @entity2 of pushing the region to the " brink of war , " may be planning a missile launch soon			1
the components , the official said , are consistent with those of a @entity31 missile , which has a 2,500 - mile range , meaning it could threaten @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
the @entity2 has been looking for a hidden @entity8 east coast launch site or mobile launchers , a concern because a launch from the east coast would go over @entity35 , the official said			1
@entity2 reducing rhetoric that feeds @entity8 rhetoric it is believed a missile launch would be a " test " launch rather than a targeted strike			1
that is because it appears the @entity8 have only moved the components so far			0
the @entity2 is waiting to see whether @entity8 issues a notice to its airmen and mariners to stay out of the region			2
communication intercepts in recent days also seem to show that @entity19 might be planning to launch a mobile ballistic missile in the coming days or weeks , another @entity2 official said			1
earlier , @entity34 defense minister @entity60 told a parliamentary committee in @entity62 that the @entity63 has moved a medium - range missile to its east coast for an imminent test firing or military drill			1
the missile does n't appear to be aimed at the @entity2 mainland , @entity60 said , according to the semi-official @entity34 news agency @entity70			1
key dates in @entity2 military moves near @entity8 wednesday , the @entity2 announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to @entity74 , a @entity75 territory that is home to @entity2 naval and air bases			1
@entity8 has cited those bases when listing possible targets for missile attacks			0
the latest developments come amid the disclosure of what one @entity2 official calls an @entity87 administration " playbook " of pre-scripted actions and responses to the last several weeks of @entity8 rhetoric and provocations			1
@entity8 : our global fear and fascination @entity95 seeks to ' turn the volume down ' @entity95 officials , while decrying @entity8 saber - rattling , said recent announcements of @entity2 military deployments in response to belligerent statements by @entity8 may have contributed to the escalating tensions between the countries			1
as the bombast reaches a fever pitch , the @entity2 is refining its message toward @entity8			2
the @entity95 now says it is working to decrease the temperature as it maintains a frank and vigilant stance toward @entity19 's threats			0
" we are trying to turn the volume down , " a @entity95 official said			0
" we accused the @entity8 of amping things up , now we are worried we did the same thing , " one @entity95 official said			0
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity117 denied that there had been a change in tone and defended the @entity2 responses			2
@entity8 social media apparently hacked " the moves that we have been making are designed to ensure and to reassure the @entity2 people and our allies that we can defend the @entity2 , that we will and that we can defend our allies , " she said			2
it was the ratcheting of tensions from @entity8 that led to the @entity2 shoring up its defense posture , she said			1
" but we have also been saying all the way through that this does not need to get hotter , that we can change course here " if @entity8 cooperates with the international community			0
at the same time , @entity139 spokeswoman @entity138 said , the @entity2 urged @entity8 's leaders " to heed president @entity87 's call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations			2
" " threats and provocative actions will not bring @entity8 the security , international respect , and economic development it seeks , " she said			0
@entity8 slams @entity2 the latest tough talk from @entity19 lashed out at the @entity2 military presence in the region			2

@entity8 rhetoric against @entity2 heats up " the @entity2 imperialists have pursued ceaseless war moves since their occupation of @entity34 , creating a touch - and - go situation several times			1
but never have they worked so desperately to launch a nuclear war against the @entity8 with all type latest nuclear hardware involved as now , " a spokesman for the @entity168 of @entity8 said in a written statement			0
the @entity8 stands for the @entity8			0
the statement said the @entity2 is " seriously mistaken if it thinks it can frighten the @entity8 with such latest weapons			0
" it said " the country will no longer remain a passive onlooker to the @entity2 imperialists ' frantic moves to ignite a nuclear war			0
" " cutting - edge weapons are not a monopoly of the @entity2 and gone are the days never to return when it could invade other countries with nukes as it pleased , " the statement said			0
" the @entity2 and the @entity34 warmongers had better stop their rash actions , deeply aware of the gravity of the prevailing situation			2
" the movement of missiles the possible movement of the @entity8 missile is " of concern , certainly to the @entity2 military and to @entity35 , " said @entity194 , director of the non-proliferation and @entity196 at the @entity197 in @entity198			1

@entity2 sending defensive missiles to @entity74 the @entity63 has medium - range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles			2
@entity2 defense secretary @entity208 said wednesday that the recent @entity8 threats to @entity74 , @entity210 and the @entity2 mainland have to be taken seriously			1
the medium - range missile will probably take about two weeks to prepare , @entity212 said , which means a potential launch could coincide with the april 15 anniversary of the birth of @entity218 , the founder of @entity8 and grandfather of its current leader , @entity220			2
" the concern we have is all you need is that one lucky shot , and that one lucky shot from a @entity8 missile could do a lot of damage to our island home , " @entity74 gov. @entity221 told @entity0 early friday			1

the actions included an increased show of @entity2 military force during the annual @entity2 - @entity34 military exercise , the @entity248			1
some of the @entity2 military 's recent moves -- including the deployment of ballistic missile defenses closer to @entity8 -- were not part of the planning			1
key dates in @entity2 military moves near @entity8 the latest situation on the @entity258 stems from the @entity63 's latest long - range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february			1
tougher @entity262 sanctions in response to those moves , combined with joint @entity2 - @entity34 military exercises in the region , are given by @entity220 's government as reasons to ratchet up its threats in recent weeks			1
on thursday , @entity8 barred @entity34 workers and managers for a second day from entering the @entity274 industrial complex , an economic cooperation zone that sits on the @entity63 's side of the border but houses operations of scores of @entity34 companies			0

most observers say the @entity63 is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile			0
it has conducted three nuclear bomb tests , in 2006 , 2009 and most recently in february			0
it has said that its nuclear weapons are a deterrent and are no longer up for negotiation			0
but @entity2 officials have said they see no unusual military movements across the @entity301 that splits the @entity258			0
