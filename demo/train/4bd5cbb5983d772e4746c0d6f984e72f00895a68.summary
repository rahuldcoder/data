why stop now ? this must be the question @entity3 is asking himself as he considers the latest @entity5 pleas for peace in @entity7 , to be discussed at a crisis summit in @entity9 on wednesday			1
since invading and annexing @entity12 almost one year ago , the @entity11 president has been running rings around the @entity14 , @entity15 and the @entity17 administration			1
it is not that @entity3 is particularly clever -- on the contrary , his behavior suggests he is paranoid , impulsive and insecure			1
but he has benefited from the greater weaknesses of his opponents			0
so as he considers his response to @entity5 's ideas for a new cease - fire and a " comprehensive settlement " in eastern @entity7 , what will @entity3 be thinking ? what does he know ? @entity3 knows , for a start , that the @entity5 are divided and running scared			1
only two @entity14 countries -- @entity31 and @entity32 -- are military powers of any consequence -- but they have zero appetite for conflict , direct or indirect , with @entity11			1
@entity38 , @entity32 's weak and unpopular president , seems to be waving a white flag before hostilities have even commenced			0
" if we do n't manage to find not just a compromise but a lasting peace agreement , we know perfectly well what the scenario will be			0
it has a name , it 's called war , " @entity38 said after meeting @entity3 on friday			1
for its part , the @entity31 government splutters impotently on the sidelines			0
as usual , it is waiting for @entity54 to tell it what to do			0
but with a difficult national election due in may , prime minister @entity57 figures there are no votes in @entity7			1
eastern @entity5 countries , with bitter memories of @entity64 hegemony and long , porous borders to protect , want a tougher line			2
@entity67 feels particularly vulnerable ( just look at the map )			0
so , too , do the much - bullied @entity70 states , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
but these countries know there is little point relying on help from @entity78 , home of the @entity14 's bureaucracy			0
limited economic and financial sanctions on @entity11 will expire this summer unless all 28 @entity14 governments agree to extend them			2
@entity83 , maneuvering for debt relief , is flirting treacherously with @entity86			0
recession - hit economies such as @entity88 seem to believe business as normal with @entity11 trumps calls for solidarity over @entity7			1
all of which leaves @entity93 , the @entity14 's paymaster , largest economy , and @entity11 's biggest @entity5 trade partner			1
@entity97 , @entity93 chancellor , has taken the lead since the @entity7 crisis erupted			2
and she has been widely praised for her role			0
this is puzzling because , despite numerous one - on - one conversations with @entity3 , @entity97 has achieved nothing			1
seen one way , her diplomacy has provided cover for ongoing @entity11 depredations			2
last september 's @entity9 cease - fire agreement was ignored from day one			1
@entity97 's day - trip to @entity86 last friday , with lightweight @entity38 in tow , was no bold bid for peace			2
it was an act of desperation -- and @entity3 undoubtedly knew it			2
speaking at the @entity117 security conference , @entity97 criticized @entity11 for failing to honor @entity9			2
but , she claimed , it was still worth trying to press @entity3 to do so			2
the main " new " idea on the table seems to be a demilitarized zone embracing september 's cease - fire positions and the current front line			1
if implemented , it would require the @entity126 government to concede control of yet more territory			0
by freezing the conflict in place , it would increase the chances of a permanent eastern secession			0
here is a cautionary precedent : after the 1974 @entity138 invasion of @entity139 , the island was split in two and a @entity141 - patrolled buffer zone created			0
more than 40 years later , that " temporary " dividing line still exists , as does the unrecognized " state " calling itself the @entity144			0
but @entity97 , like the leaders of most western and southern @entity5 countries , opposes tougher alternatives such arming president @entity149 's out - gunned forces			1
her tone in @entity117 , a location forever associated with appeasement , was flatly defeatist			0
" i can not imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the @entity7 army leads to president @entity3 being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily , " she said			1
this seems to be the broad @entity5 view			2
arming the @entity7 would mean war with @entity11 , a war that @entity3 would win			1
and it is plain the @entity5 will do just about anything to avoid that dread outcome			2
all this @entity3 knows , or has been told by his canny foreign minister , @entity164 , who greatly amused the @entity117 conference by insisting , absurdly , that there were no @entity11 troops or armor in eastern @entity7			1
but what else does @entity3 know as he ponders @entity97 's plan to halt the hostilities ? @entity3 knows that the deep divisions within the @entity14 over @entity7 are also present within @entity15 , an alliance with a roughly similar membership			1
@entity3 knows that @entity15 's leading power , the @entity175 , did not react militarily when @entity11 sent its tanks into @entity177 in 2008 and subsequently encouraged breakaway separatists in @entity179 and @entity180 to declare independence from @entity182			1
@entity3 knows @entity15 was similarly passive when he took over @entity12 by stealth one year ago this month			1
while @entity7 is not in @entity15 , this startling violation of international law raised a bigger , potentially embarrassing question : what would @entity15 do if one of its member states was next ? @entity15 answers that in such circumstances it would invoke @entity190 of its founding treaty , which states : " the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in @entity5 or @entity195 shall be considered an attack against them all			1
" but this valiant concept of collective defense has never really been tested			0
article 5 has only been invoked once , after the 9/11 attacks			0
and @entity202 , luckily , did not have thermonuclear weapons			0
would the @entity175 really go to war with @entity11 to rescue , say , @entity71 or @entity205 ? @entity3 does not know the answer to this question , but neither , if they are truthful , do @entity15 's political masters			1
what @entity3 does know , or thinks he knows , is that , given @entity17 's attempts to wind up overseas conflicts in @entity214 and @entity215 and his reluctance to get involved in new ones such as @entity218 , the @entity175 president will be loath to confront @entity11 militarily in @entity7 in what could quickly become an uncontrollable , escalating proxy war			1
pressure is growing from @entity222 and others in @entity224 , egged on by jittery east @entity5 , to supply arms to @entity126			2
last week the administration deliberately leaked news that it was discussing this option to the @entity229			0
it was a classic pressure tactic			0
but so far , the only people who feel scared and pressured are the @entity5 allies			2
@entity3 has not blinked , while @entity234 spokesmen and propagandists say supplying @entity175 arms would confirm their view that @entity11 is under attack by the @entity239			1
maybe a new peace pact will be agreed later this week in @entity9			0
maybe it will even be made to stick , assuming @entity86 can be trusted			0
@entity3 may decide to bank his winnings			0
on the other hand , if he does not like the deal , he can walk away			0
@entity3 knows he has the upper hand			0
so why stop now ?			0

@entity3 considers his response to @entity5 's ideas for a new cease - fire in @entity7
since annexing @entity12 , @entity3 has run rings around @entity175 , @entity5 leaders , says @entity253
would the @entity175 really go to war with @entity11 to rescue , say , @entity71 or @entity205 , he asks
