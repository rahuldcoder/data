@entity0 -- homeowners who wound up paying thousands more dollars in special taxes than their neighbors for the same sewage service found no relief at the @entity8 on monday			1
the justices , by a 6 - 3 vote , upheld the decision by city officials in @entity13 to deny refunds for some residents who paid their assessment fees up front , while forgiving the remaining taxes of those choosing an installment plan			1
chief justice @entity22 , in a tough dissent , said the result was a " gross disparity			0
" those with the heftier bills sued , saying their @entity28 rights under the @entity30 were being violated			0
the city had abandoned its installment plan option after just one year , and justice @entity33 said that was a proper exercise of government , since it reduced administrative costs			1
" the city had a rational basis for distinguishing between those lot owners who had already paid their share of project costs and those who had not			1
and we conclude there is no equal protection violation , " he said			0
" state law says nothing about forgiveness , how to design a forgiveness program , or whether or when rational distinctions in doing so are permitted			2
" he said the @entity8 stepping in " would risk transforming ordinary violations of ordinary state tax law into violations of the federal constitution			1
" @entity56 allows public works projects to be apportioned , meaning costs can be spread equally along " all abutting lands or lots			0
" the @entity62 / @entity61 began in 2001 , to connect about 180 @entity13 homes to the city 's existing sewage system			2
thirty - eight homeowners individually decided to pay their assessments up front -- $ 9,278			1
the rest agreed to monthly installments spread over 10 to 30 years , including interest			0
but the city soon decided to shelve the long - standing assessment plan , concluding the lot - by - lot payments were discouraging families from moving from less healthy septic systems to more efficient sewer systems			1
the new public improvements financing system adopted by @entity13 now relies on a single , flat $ 2,500 fee to connect sewer lines			0
city - issued bonds would help cover remaining costs			1
outstanding payments under the old method were canceled , but refunds were denied those who had already paid in in full			1
court records show some property owners on the installment plan paid as little as $ 309 , and a quarter of the rest put in less than $ 1,000			1
the 38 homeowners who had paid in full asked for a partial refund , but officials in the state capital said in a letter that to provide one " would establish a precedent of unfair and inequitable treatment to all property owners " who had also paid the assessments throughout the city , even partially			1
thirty - one homeowners then sued , claiming disparate treatment			2
the average claim was about $ 8,000			0
@entity33 said the city 's desire to reduce " financial hardships " for those paying under the old lot - by - lot system was adequate justification for the change , and did not amount to a constitutional violation			2
he said the controversy was a local one , not implicating interstate commerce			0
" every generation or so , a case comes along when this court needs to say enough is enough , if the @entity28 is to retain any force in this context			0
" joined by justices @entity121 and @entity123 , @entity22 added that the city promised to treat all homeowners the same , but " ended up charging some homeowners 30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same hook - ups			1
the equal protection violation is plain			0
" groups opposing the city were disappointed in the decision			2
" the @entity28 is supposed to mean what it says : that people are entitled to equal treatment , " explained @entity137 attorney @entity136 , who filed a supporting brief in the case			0
" but the lesson of today 's decision is less ' people must be treated equally ' and more ' never pay the government up front			0
' " the case is @entity150 of @entity13 ( 11 - 161 ) .			2

homeowners *seeking* a refund of special tax payments lose their appeal
the @entity8 , in a 6 - 3 ruling , says the city had a rational basis for its action
some homeowners paid thousands more before the city changed its payment plan
