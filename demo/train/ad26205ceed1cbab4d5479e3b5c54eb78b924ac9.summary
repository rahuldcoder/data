today marks the 508th anniversary of the death of @entity2			1
everybody knows the story of @entity2 , right ? he was an @entity6 explorer from @entity7 who set sail in 1492 to enrich the @entity11 monarchs with gold and spices from the orient			2
for too long , scholars have ignored @entity2 ' grand passion : the quest to liberate @entity18 from the @entity19			2
during @entity2 ' lifetime , @entity20 became the target of fanatical religious persecution			1
on march 31 , 1492 , @entity24 and @entity25 proclaimed that all @entity20 were to be expelled from @entity26			2
the edict especially targeted the 800,000 @entity20 who had never converted , and gave them four months to pack up and get out			2
the @entity20 who were forced to renounce @entity29 and embrace @entity30 were known as " @entity31 , " or converts			1
there were also those who feigned conversion , practicing @entity30 outwardly while covertly practicing @entity29 , the so - called " @entity35 , " or swine			1
tens of thousands of @entity35 were tortured by the @entity38			2
they were pressured to offer names of friends and family members , who were ultimately paraded in front of crowds , tied to stakes and burned alive			0
their land and personal possessions were then divvied up by the church and crown			0
recently , a number of @entity11 scholars , such as @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , have concluded that @entity2 was a @entity35 , whose survival depended upon the suppression of all evidence of his @entity20 background in face of the brutal , systematic ethnic cleansing			1
@entity2 , who was known in @entity26 as @entity2 and did n't speak @entity6 , signed his last will and testament on may 19 , 1506 , and made five curious -- and revealing -- provisions			2
two of his wishes -- tithe one - tenth of his income to the poor and provide an anonymous dowry for poor girls -- are part of @entity20 customs			2
he also decreed to give money to a jew who lived at the entrance of the @entity77			0
on those documents , @entity2 used a triangular signature of dots and letters that resembled inscriptions found on gravestones of @entity20 cemeteries in @entity26			1
he ordered his heirs to use the signature in perpetuity			0
according to @entity90 historian @entity89 's " the history of the @entity35 , " the anagram was a cryptic substitute for the @entity92 , a prayer recited in the synagogue by mourners after the death of a close relative			1
thus , @entity2 ' subterfuge allowed his sons to say @entity92 for their crypto - @entity20 father when he died			1
finally , @entity2 left money to support the crusade he hoped his successors would take up to liberate the @entity107			2
@entity108 , a linguistics professor at @entity109 , has analyzed the language and syntax of hundreds of handwritten letters , diaries and documents of @entity2 and concluded that the explorer 's primary written and spoken language was @entity11			0
@entity108 explains that 15th - century @entity11 was the " @entity118 " of @entity119 , known as " @entity120			0
" at the top left - hand corner of all but one of the 13 letters written by @entity2 to his son @entity124 contained the handwritten hebrew letters bet - hei , meaning b'ezrat @entity127 ( with @entity129 's help )			0
observant @entity20 have for centuries customarily added this blessing to their letters			0
no letters to outsiders bear this mark , and the one letter to @entity124 in which this was omitted was one meant for @entity24			0
in @entity140 's book , " @entity146 , " he argues that @entity2 ' voyage was motivated by a desire to find a safe haven for the @entity20 in light of their expulsion from @entity26			1
likewise , @entity147 , a cultural anthropologist at @entity148 , concludes that @entity2 was a deeply religious man whose purpose was to sail to @entity151 to obtain gold in order to finance a crusade to take back @entity18 and rebuild the @entity155			1
in @entity2 ' day , @entity20 widely believed that @entity18 had to be liberated and the @entity155 rebuilt for the @entity156 to come			1
scholars point to the date on which @entity2 set sail as further evidence of his true motives			0
he was originally going to sail on august 2 , 1492 , a day that happened to coincide with the @entity20 holiday of @entity166 , marking the destruction of the @entity168 of @entity18			0
@entity2 postponed this original sail date by one day to avoid embarking on the holiday , which would have been considered by @entity20 to be an unlucky day to set sail			1
( @entity173 or significantly , the day he set forth was the very day that @entity20 were , by law , given the choice of converting , leaving @entity26 , or being killed			0
) @entity2 ' voyage was not , as is commonly believed , funded by the deep pockets of @entity25 , but rather by two @entity31 and another prominent jew			1
@entity179 and @entity180 advanced an interest free loan of 17,000 ducats from their own pockets to help pay for the voyage , as did @entity185 , rabbi and @entity20 statesman			1
indeed , the first two letters @entity2 sent back from his journey were not to @entity24 and @entity25 , but to @entity179 and @entity55 , thanking them for their support and telling them what he had found			0
the evidence seem to bear out a far more complicated picture of the man for whom our nation now celebrates a national holiday and has named its capital			0
as we witness bloodshed the world over in the name of religious freedom , it is valuable to take another look at the man who sailed the seas in search of such freedoms -- landing in a place that would eventually come to hold such an ideal at its very core .			0
