@entity0 -- the next time @entity4 goes to rally for a candidate at a campaign event , she might want to take a good look at the sign pasted on the front of her podium			1
speaking at an event for @entity15 candidate @entity14 , the first lady mispronounced the @entity18 hopeful 's name not once , not twice , but seven times in front of a crowd of supporters			1
" i 'm very excited to be here to support your next senator from @entity28 , our friend @entity29 , " the first lady said commencing her speech on friday			0
" @entity28 , if you want a leader that shares your values and will stand up for your families out in @entity0 , then you need to elect @entity29 to the @entity37 , " she said again a few sentences later			0
@entity4 continued to mispronounce the @entity14 's name five more times until she was interrupted by an audience member , who made her aware of her continued slip - up			1
" @entity14 ? " she asked , looking quizzical			2
" what did i say ? i 'm losing it , " she laughed			0
" i 'm getting old			0
" " vote dot @entity14 dot com , " she finally said , correcting herself , to some very loud applause			2
" i know where i am			0
i know what i 'm doing , " she reassured the crowd			0

" first lady botches name of @entity58 candidate at rally , " @entity54 spokesman @entity53 tweeted			0
" @entity62 might want to prepare for a call from @entity14 , got ta avoid a " litigious situation " over mispronouncing name # @entity65 , " @entity61 spokesman @entity60 tweeted			0
" if a conservative @entity54 made the mistake that mrs. @entity4 just made by calling @entity14 by the wrong name , it would be the biggest story ! " key @entity73 races to watch at least the first lady was n't the first high - profile @entity76 to make this exact same blunder			1
at the @entity79 just a few weeks ago in @entity28 , former president @entity78 also botched @entity14 's last name			1
" you know what you ought to do to honor the @entity85 legacy -- and that is to elect @entity29 , " @entity78 said			0
