-- the issue of whether @entity2 should be a requirement for @entity4 to be considered for statehood lasted for a third day -- two days ahead of the @entity9 territory 's @entity7 presidential primary -- and provided @entity10 and @entity11 with opportunities to take shots at each other			1
the back and forth began wendesday , when @entity11 said while campaigning in @entity4 that @entity2 should be the principal language in @entity4 before it could gain statehood			1
@entity4 will vote on a statehood referendum in november			0
@entity10 's campaign issued a statement thursday contrasting his position on the issue with @entity11 's			1
" @entity4 currently recognizes both @entity2 and @entity23 as the official languages of the commonwealth , " @entity10 spokeswoman @entity22 said			1
" gov. @entity10 believes that @entity2 is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand @entity2 proficiency in @entity4 and across @entity9			1
however , he would not , as a prerequisite for statehood , require that the people of @entity4 cease using @entity23			0
" but at @entity0 's debate in @entity34 , @entity35 , in january ahead of @entity35 's primary , @entity10 said that @entity2 should be the nation 's official language			1
after arriving in @entity4 on friday , @entity10 said he would have " no preconditions " on language for @entity4 to gain statehood			1
minutes later , @entity11 deputy communications director @entity41 tweeted , " so @entity10 once supported @entity2 as national language , then goes to @entity4 and says no language req on statehood			1
# @entity44 ? # @entity45 ? " @entity11 's communications director , @entity47 , noted broad support for @entity2 as the nation 's official language and said in an e-mail to reporters , " how can @entity10 say he supports @entity2 as the official language of @entity9 and not believe @entity4 should speak @entity2 ? if he 'll spend the whole election being untruthful about his positions -- it makes you wonder what else he 's being untruthful about			1
" but @entity57 responded , " gov. @entity10 supports making @entity2 the official language of the @entity9 government			1
this should have no impact on @entity4 's statehood effort			2
@entity2 has been an official language of @entity4 for over 100 years			1
" @entity10 was also asked in @entity4 about his criticism of @entity67 @entity66 @entity65 , which has roiled some @entity67 voters			1
" in looking at @entity65 , my view was that her philosophy is quite different than my own , and that 's the reason why i would not support her as a justice for the @entity66 , " @entity10 said			1
" had i been in the @entity73 -- i was not in the @entity73 -- i would be happy to have a justice of @entity67 descent or a @entity67 individual on the @entity66 , but they would have to share my judicial philosophy			2
" @entity11 's campaign announced friday that it had brought in $ 1 million since its twin wins in @entity83 and @entity84 on tuesday			1
but then he was forced to address an off - message issue when asked about an undated post on his website that said the country is " suffering a pandemic of harm from pornography , " including " profound brain changes in both children and adults			1
" at an event in @entity96 on friday , @entity11 said , " i said that as a president , i would enforce the law , which is not being done now			2
" the post on @entity11 's campaign site criticizes the current administration , saying the @entity102 is failing to prosecute the law			1
" the @entity105 has turned a blind eye to those who wish to preserve our culture from the scourge of pornography and has refused to enforce obscenity laws , " the site said			0
" while the @entity114 @entity102 seems to favor pornographers over children and families , that will change under a @entity118			0
" @entity11 has been criticized by some @entity7 from focusing too much on social issues when the economy is most on voters ' minds			2
the former @entity124 senator was campaigning in @entity96 ahead of that state 's primary on tuesday			0
@entity10 campaigned in the state on friday morning before flying to @entity4			0
@entity10 predicted victory in @entity96 on friday morning and focused more on president @entity114 than his @entity7 opponents , hitting familiar themes , like gas prices			0
the @entity7 front - runner responded to @entity114 's energy speech on thursday , telling a crowd in @entity135 , " he is out there pushing for alternative energy , and we are here pushing for an alternative to the president			0
we are going to get a new president			0
" @entity10 also responded to the 17 - minute video that @entity114 's campaign released thursday night and offered director @entity144 some advice			1
" i 'll give you some help , mr. @entity144			0
you can make a call to some of the moms that are having a hard time paying for gas as they get their kids to and from school and practice and music lessons			0
you can also talk to people who are having a hard time getting to and from work , given the price of gasoline			0
" @entity10 is expected to win @entity4 's primary , which will award its delegates proportionally			2
however , if any one candidate wins a majority , he would take all 20 delegates			0
asked on @entity0 's " @entity169 " whether @entity11 's comments reflected a lack of understanding about @entity4 , the territory 's @entity173 gov. @entity173 , who has endorsed @entity10 , said , " gov. @entity10 has shown respect for exactly our heritage and our history , understands it better			1
that 's why i 'm supporting gov. @entity10 , because he has shown respect towards our community			2
" @entity173 also said @entity10 's economic and security message has resonated on the island			2
" if we want to win the hearts and minds of @entity191 voters across @entity9 , you have to understand what @entity191 voters care about : we care about public safety , we care about location , we care about lowering taxes , on creating the proper conditions to create jobs			0
@entity10 has done that down here in @entity4 , " @entity173 said			0
@entity4 's primary comes two days before the showdown in @entity96 , where 66 delegates will be awarded proportionally and polls show a tight race between @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity11 's campaign was re-energized after key primary victories in the @entity208 that raised questions about conservative rival @entity211 's viability as a candidate and portended a long battle with @entity10			1
@entity10 , rejected again by @entity208 conservatives in the tuesday primaries in @entity84 and @entity83 , won caucuses in @entity218 and @entity219 to claim about a third of the total delegates available and maintain his delegate lead			0
however , @entity11 's twin primary triumphs -- while narrow -- reframed the @entity7 race as a one - on - one battle between the socially conservative former @entity124 senator and the more moderate @entity10 , with @entity228 's chances fading fast			1
@entity0 's latest delegate estimates show @entity10 with 498 delegates to @entity231 's 239			2
@entity228 is 100 delegates behind @entity11 , and @entity234 rep. @entity233 , the libertarian champion , won 69 delegates			1
the @entity83 and @entity84 victories gave @entity11 wins in 10 states , to @entity10 's 18			1
@entity228 won the @entity240 primary in january and last week in @entity241 , which he represented in @entity242 for 20 years			2
asked friday whether he would end his campaign should his wealthiest backer , @entity244 , urge him to do so , @entity228 insisted that he would stick it out until the very end			2
" i 'll be with you in @entity251 , " @entity228 said on @entity247 's " this morning , " referring to the site of the @entity249 in august			2
@entity244 , a @entity252 casino mogul known for his strong support for @entity254 , has donated millions in recent months to winning our future , a @entity258 super pac			0
but the former @entity260 speaker argued friday that he has more than 175,000 online donors to consider when making a decision about his presidential run			0
" they want me to stay in the race , and i really represent their interest as individuals , " he said , adding that 95 % of them have given less than $ 250			0
asked friday whether he thought @entity228 was hurting the @entity7 by staying in the race and shoring up delegates , @entity10 avoided making the case that his opponent should call it quits			1
" well , i do n't know , but he certainly has every right to carry his campaign as long as he feels it has a meaningful opportunity for him to become the nominee , and he cares very deeply about the country as i do , and i wish him well , " @entity10 said on @entity273			1
after the stop in @entity282 , @entity11 has two events in @entity96			0
he 's also getting help in the form of a $ 310,000 ad purchase in @entity96 from the @entity287 , a super pac that has been supportive of his candidacy			0
@entity10 is bringing in @entity290 gov. @entity289 to campaign for him in the state friday			2
@entity289 , who 's popular with republicans across the country for his tough talk and tough actions in taking on @entity296 in @entity290 , disappointed many in his party in october when he announced that he would not launch his own presidential bid			0
instead , he endorsed @entity10 and has traveled to a number of primary and caucus states to stump for him			0
@entity11 and @entity10 are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar			1
after @entity4 and @entity96 , @entity11 is expected to win in @entity305 a week from saturday			0
then the race turns north and east : the @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity310 vote on april 3 , and @entity10 is the early favorite			2
but that 's three weeks away , and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile @entity7 race in generations			0
@entity0 's @entity316 and @entity317 contributed to this report .			0
