-- two men -- two champions -- two completely different worlds			2
but for @entity5 that 's the way he likes it			1
while @entity8 has had to carry the weight of @entity11 expectation on his shoulders since he emerged as a talented teenager , @entity7 has been grateful to stay out of the limelight			1
the golfer witnessed @entity8 's dramatic @entity17 victory over @entity18 from the @entity20 's @entity19 just days after his own triumph -- a first major success at the @entity23			1
while @entity7 has been able to progress quietly since bursting onto the scene as a promising amateur in 1997 , @entity8 has had to cope with constant media attention and an entire nation watching his every move			1
for @entity7 , those circumstances make @entity8 's triumph even more remarkable -- not that he envies the attention which goes with the @entity33 's success			1
" i think what he achieved captured the imagination so much , " @entity7 told @entity0			1
" if i was to go on and win the @entity37 then i think there would be some parallels to that but i 'm not always the great @entity11 hope			1
" i 'm now the highest ranked @entity43 or @entity11 player but there are a few of us			1
there 's @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , " added @entity7 , referring to @entity47			1
" i do n't feel like i 'm the only one which @entity8 is			1
" just as @entity8 's life will never be the same again following his @entity17 triumph , @entity7 too must adapt to being a major winner and dealing with all the hype which surrounds such a feat. since his victory at @entity59 , @entity7 has been on television screens across the world , had his picture splashed on the front cover of magazines and newspapers and appeared on countless talk shows			1
for a man who often likes to spend time in the background with his wife @entity72 and two small children , the hysteria created by his success has come as something as a surprise			2
the chance to get back on the golf course at @entity78 offers the chance for solace following a rollercoaster few weeks and @entity7 simply can not wait			1
" @entity37 has a special place in my heart , " he said			1
" to win your home tournament is the one you dream of winning as a kid			2
it would be my favorite tournament to win			2
i 'd be grateful to win any tournament really			2
" winning in golf can be far and few between but to win this is what i dreamed of as a kid			1
" it was as a kid that @entity7 first shot to prominence -- finishing fourth while still playing as an amateur at the @entity101 at @entity102 at the age of just 17			1
his dramatic chip at the 18th from 50 yards went down in @entity23 folklore although @entity7 admits his memories of the incident are somewhat vague			1
" i 've watched it and turned up the volume on the 18th to recreate the roar , " he said			0
" i wish my memory was better			0
it was a crazy way to finish and i do n't think i could take it all in			0
" i was so young at the time			0
there was an embarrassed look up to the sky with me thinking , ' what have i just done ? ' @entity117 was my reaction with it			0
" i 've always said that to surpass that achievement i 'd have to go on and win the @entity23			1
maybe winning the @entity23 has done that but i have had a very special relationship with the @entity23			1
" hopefully that will end up with the @entity124 , " added @entity7 , referring to the iconic @entity23 trophy following his success at the @entity23 back in 1998 where he finished one shot behind @entity130 and two off the leaders , @entity7 was expected to bloom			1
but after turning professional straight after his historic finish , @entity7 struggled badly , missing the cut in his first 21 events			2
now , 15 years later , @entity7 has come through and finally realized the potential which so many saw in him as a skinny teenager			2
" i always believed in myself , " he added			0
" i had to dig in and keep going			0
i was motivated by the fact i did n't want to be the one week wonder , the flash in the pan at the @entity23			2
" @entity146 is hard and has many aspects to it			0
it 's as much a mental game as a physical one			0
i 've probably had the talent for a long time and people tell you that you 're good enough to do it but you have to truly believe it yourself			0
" and when you can truly believe yourself , that 's when you can handle the pressure			2
in the past three or four years , i 've developed a real deep rooted sense of belief			0
" there was some scar tissue i had to cut down			0
missing those 21 cuts was a traumatic start to my professional career			0
" then i had chances to win tournaments but did n't quite put them away and again confidence can be dented			0
it has been slow progress for me but i 've got a good team around me			0
" they keep me on track and together we 'll put a good game plan			0
" with one major title under his belt , @entity7 will now turn his attention to lifting the @entity124 and fulfilling a childhood dream			2
ranked third in the world below @entity130 and @entity182 , @entity7 believes he is finally ready to compete for another major title			1
" winning at @entity59 has given me a tremendous amount of confidence , " added @entity7			1
" you hope you 're good enough to win a major , you think you 're good enough to win a major but it 's not until you do it that you know you 're good enough to win a major			0
" you never know how you 're going to handle the moment			0
i always knew i would create chances to win but there have been great players before me that have had chances that have never been able to quite put it away			0
" i feel fortunate to have that monkey off my back			0
i feel like i 've only been ready to win majors in the past year or two			2
hopefully now i 've now got five to 10 years of good golf left in me			0
hopefully i can draw upon that experience in a similar situation			0
