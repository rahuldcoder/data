@entity0 -- over the next few days , the drama of a potential government shutdown will collide with the promise of a new health insurance system known as @entity6			1
here are answers to eight of the most pressing questions about both : 1			1
what happens on october 1 with @entity6 and the government shutdown ? first , the health insurance exchanges established by the @entity6 -- or @entity6 -- will be open for business			1
millions of uninsured @entity15 will be able to enroll in health plans before the law kicks in on january 1 , 2014			1
second , the @entity15 government might " shut down " if lawmakers ca n't agree to pass a funding bill that has attached to it a provision to defund @entity6			1
these two events are linked			2
the reason both houses of @entity26 may not be able to agree on a funding bill -- also known as a continuing resolution -- is that some senators and representatives see this as their last chance to stop @entity6			1
but that 's really where the link ends			2
shutdown showdown over @entity6 moves to @entity36 2			1
does a government shutdown shut down @entity6 ? not really			1
most of the funding for @entity6 comes from new taxes and fees , from cost cuts to other programs like @entity44 and other types of funding that carry on even in the event of a government shutdown			1
@entity26 ' research arm , the @entity49 , prepared a memo for @entity52 sen. @entity51 , @entity53 , that suggested an effort to use the government shutdown as leverage to force @entity57 to delay implementing the law would not really work because the law will continue regardless of a shutdown			1
plus , the law would still be in effect , so its many new requirements -- everything from forcing insurance companies to cover anyone who wants insurance to forcing everyday @entity15 to carry health insurance or pay a fine -- would still be in effect , too			1
government shutdown : again ? seriously ? 3			1
do i have to sign up for a new health insurance plan on october 1 when open enrollment for @entity6 begins ? maybe -- take this quick survey and we 'll find out : @entity78 do you get health insurance from your employer ? if the answer is yes -- and this is by far the no. 1 way @entity15 get health insurance -- go on about your business			1
@entity6 does n't really affect you			1
a lot of people think that because of @entity6 , fewer companies will offer health insurance , particularly to low - paid workers and retirees			1
there is some evidence of this			0
these employers would have to pay a per - worker fine to the government , but it might be cheaper for them in the long run to pay this fine to the government rather than offer insurance			2
other companies might cut hours for some workers , making them part - timers working fewer than 30 hours a week in order to avoid helping pay their health insurance			2
but it will take some years to see if it really comes to pass			0
however , if you get health insurance at work , you could probably drop that coverage and buy health insurance on the @entity6 exchanges			1
but you might not want to			0
you wo n't qualify for any government help to buy your insurance and your employer would n't be contributing any of the money it is now			1
@entity120 do you get health insurance from the government ? if the answer is yes , go on about your business			2
@entity6 does n't really affect you			1
while @entity6 relies on making @entity44 more efficient as a way to pay for some new services for younger people , it is not supposed to change the services offered by @entity44			1
one big test of this promise is @entity132			0
these are privately administered insurance plans that provide @entity44 services to seniors			0
they cost the government more per person to provide @entity44			2
so , @entity6 seeks to bring their spending back in line with the rest of @entity44			1
this could lead to changes in @entity132 options , like gym memberships and other items that are offered as enticements			0
but the same core @entity44 services are supposed to remain in effect			2
the same goes for @entity152			0
if you get your insurance from one of the 50 state - run @entity152 programs , @entity6 should not affect you			1
but you 'll have a lot more company in these programs , which will grow to insure a larger portion of @entity15			0

do you have an individual health insurance plan ? if yes , @entity6 is going to affect you			1
it is possible that your insurance plan wo n't change , but it 's just as likely that your plan does n't meet all the minimum requirements the law imposes			0
these include new rules for how much profit companies can take for plans , new rules for coverage of women 's services , new rules for how much more insurance companies can charge for women than men , and a lot more			0
so , you might have to buy a more expensive plan			0
in this case , your insurance company has probably already let you know			0
it 's also possible you might want a new plan			0
check out your new state health insurance exchange or the one the federal government set up in your state if your state government refused to do so			1
people who like and dislike @entity6 have something to like about costs of individual plans			1
prelminary estimates have come in lower than some government prognosticators expected			2
so it is fair to say @entity6 might be cheaper than expected for some individuals			1
but it is also accurate to say that premiums are likely to rise for healthy people on the individual market			0
why ? they 're going to get more robust insurance plans that cover more things			0
at the same time , a lot of sick people who get private insurance now pay a ton for it ; their costs could decrease			0
@entity26 : will it be a government shutdown or budget compromise ? 5			1
do you have no health insurance ? if so , @entity6 is for you , like it or not			1
you 're either going to have to enroll in @entity152 or buy health insurance from a private company on an " exchange " organized by either your state government or the federal government			1
if you 're single and you make less than $ 15,281.70 ( $ 31,321.50 for a family of four ) , you 're likely to get @entity152 , although some states have refused to expand their programs			0
those income levels for @entity152 -- 133 % of the federal poverty level -- will increase from year to year			2
10 ways a government shutdown would affect your daily life 6			1
how much is @entity6 going to cost me ? it depends			1
what if you make more than $ 15,281.70 , but not that much more ? you do n't get @entity239			0
you do n't have employer - sponsored health insurance and you do want coverage			0
how are you supposed to afford a new health insurance plan ? the government is going to help a lot of people pay for it			2
if you 're single and you make less than $ 45,960 ( $ 94,200 for a family of four ) , you 'll qualify for a government - sponsored subsidy to help you buy insurance			2
the @entity251 has estimated the average government subsidy for a family will be about $ 2,700 and the average premium costs will be about $ 8,250			2
those costs will vary depending on the age and number of family members and the level of plan they choose to buy			0
try your own scenario here			0
@entity262 : the lowdown on the shutdown , or why you should care about the @entity49 7			2
is @entity6 health insurance government insurance ? no. many state medicaid programs will grow to insure much larger portions of their state populations			1
but the core of the law is the creation of new health insurance exchanges			0
these are places -- online , mostly -- where people who do n't get insurance can buy it from a private company			0
on the one hand , the government is making people either carry insurance or pay a fine , on the other hand the government is making insurance companies provide insurance to anyone who wants it and they 're controlling how much the insurance companies can charge			2
what happens if i do n't buy health insurance ? you 're young and healthy			0
you do n't really want health insurance			0
you do n't have to buy it			0
you can " opt out			0
" but then you 'll have to pay a fine of between $ 95 for every adult in your house or 1 % of your income after $ 10,000 , whichever is larger			2
so if you 're single and you make $ 50,000 , you 'd have to pay a $ 400 fine for not having health insurance			0
the @entity303 called this fine a tax			0
you can look at it that way			0
or you can view it as an upfront payment for having hospital and ambulance services able to come get you if you need them			0
or you can look at it as horrible government overreach			2
