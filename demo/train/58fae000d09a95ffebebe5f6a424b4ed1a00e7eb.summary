-- the @entity1 is set to change our lives dramatically over the next decade			1
this will also raise questions about the use of personal data and the need to balance new powers with ethics			1
here are five ways you can expect the explosion in technology to impact you : 1 ) artificial intelligence and ultra-smart software engines will be embedded everywhere			1
they will be largely invisible yet become indispensable for most internet users , and will combine dozens of data streams harvested from our digital breadcrumbs			1

powerful , fast , totally customized and self - learning algorithms will feed off our personal data streams , giving us an ever - expanding and free choice of seemingly harmless anticipatory services ( think @entity40 x 100 )			1
prediction engines will be able to give a " heads - up " on anything from weather , to stock market changes , to food warnings or even imminent relationship changes			0
read more : stuck in the digital transit zone for many of us , this will cross the border into creepiness			1
imagine your mobile device recommending that you break your next date because of obvious incompatibility based on what " the system " knows about you			1
@entity60 will start to literally run our lives ( as this @entity63 report put it : @entity65 )			2
2 ) automation is likely do away with hundreds of millions of " simple " jobs			0
it will replace cab drivers ( no need , with self - driving cars ) , check - out clerks ( all done on mobiles ) , data analysts , bank tellers , file clerks , delivery people and others			0
smart software engines and networked cloud systems are likely to replace accountants and book - keepers , among others , while delivery drones will replace delivery drivers			0
robots will become common in many households , such as for basic elderly care , but will remain far from human - like or even sentient for quite some time			0
read more : inventing machines for the future reports such as the @entity92 study have already predicted that nearly half of all @entity95 jobs could eventually be automated away			1
clearly , human - only tasks and right - brain skills will need to be much more emphasized in education , as well , and the concept of a minimum guaranteed income may seem a lot less futuristic fairly soon			0
we may get paid to just be creative			0
3 ) augmented reality and " natural " human - computer interfaces will overtake traditional means of making queries			0
we are going from typing a request , to speaking , to gesturing to blinking to ( scarily ) thinking			0
some may start to feel like they live inside a machine or that a machine lives inside of them			2
humans are likely to become dependent on digital machines and what they do for us , simply because they will be so easy to use , so powerful , so addictive -- and because they make so much money for those who run them			1

4 ) @entity124 , real - time , mobile and accurate language translation will be with us within five years			1
imagine speaking into your mobile device and having someone else receive the precise translation at almost the same moment , in a multitude of languages			2
then , imagine all these conversations being recorded and added to your profile in your " personal cloud			0
" this will dramatically change the nature of media and advertising			2
kids may also question the use of learning languages			0
5 ) everything will be recorded , photo - and video - graphed , tracked and measured			0
your car 's movements , your performance at work , your dietary habits , the meta - data of your communications will all be scanned			0
read more : my year of living open source the explosive growth of the @entity28 and the upcoming explosion of internet access in devices that are wearable , embedded or implanted means we can expect this trend to be all - pervasive within the coming decade			0
do we need to control this ? the most important consequence of such trends will be the reemergence of ethics as a key issue			1
major challenges , such as personal data protection , privacy , human augmentation , " digital obesity " and dependency on technology will be magnified exponentially			1
we will no longer ask if something is possible or doable but whether we should do it , where and when			0
i predict many of tomorrow 's leaders , thinkers , innovators , scientists and creatives will spend time and effort devising something like a " global digital bill of rights and ethics			1
" read more : after @entity189 , we 're self - censoring the need for global agreements on these key issues will emerge as a direct response to the vastly accelerating abuse of personal data and the powerful ai that crunches it , giving those that control it almost irresistible powers			1
i predict even the most technology - friendly or social - network obsessed users will soon start to object to being instrumentalized in such a way			0
this will force governments and businesses towards creating a " secure framework " for society			0
as with nuclear power , we will need to distinguish between what can be used for bona - fide purposes and what could be used for sinister purposes			2
the resulting digital data and @entity60 ecoystem will need to become the global guideline , akin to a kind of " artificial intelligence and automation non-proliferation agreement			1
" technology does not have ethics -- but we should			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225			1

the @entity1 is set to change our lives in *numerous* ways , the use of artificial intelligence to language translation and more
futurist @entity225 says machines may eventually know us so well they will tell us when to break off a date
humans will become addicted to digital machines because they are so powerful and easy to use
but that will create fears around privacy and lead to *discussions* on ethics and how we control the power
