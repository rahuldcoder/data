-- the @entity1 on monday will rule on a politically - charged @entity2 appeal involving a requirement that certain , for - profit businesses provide contraceptive coverage to their employees			1
can those employers avoid the requirement if they object on moral or religious grounds ? can they do so if they see this as a requirement that can -- in their view -- ultimately lead to abortion ? that 's what the justices have weighed over several months			1
here are five questions to consider in advance of their decision , which incidentally is the last of the term and should come down shortly after 10 a.m. et. 1			0
how big is this case ? it 's the most closely watched one this term			1
the legal and social pique may not reach the heights of two years ago when the justices narrowly preserved the @entity2 and how it is paid for			1
but the stakes are still large , and the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law championed by president @entity32 and in play as a campaign issue this midterm season as @entity36 seek to retake the @entity37			2
" this case is n't that practically important , except for the employees and businesses involved			1
there just are n't a huge number of those , " said @entity41 , publisher of @entity42 and a @entity44 appellate attorney			2
" but everyone can agree the social questions presented -- about when people can follow their religious convictions , and when people are entitled to contraception care -- are truly important , " he said			2
what 's the case about ? the court is zeroing in on part of the health care law that requires certain employers to offer insurance coverage for birth control and other reproductive health services without a copay -- even when the employers say doing so would violate their religious beliefs			1
the decision actually stems from separate appeals filed by two companies , @entity68 , a @entity70 cabinet maker , and @entity71 , an @entity72 - based retail giant			2
@entity68 employs about 1,000 people , while @entity71 has roughly 13,000 workers			0
companies say it 's wrong for the government to require they provide insurance coverage for , say , drugs that would be provided to prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman 's womb , which the business owners equate to abortion			1
under the law , companies that refuse to comply could be fined more than $ 1 million daily			2
who says what ? the @entity88 and its allies say the requirement is " lawful and essential to women 's health			2
" the @entity32 administration has defended it in court , and has already created rules exempting certain nonprofits and religiously - affiliated organizations , like churches , from the requirement			0
in those cases , women would receive coverage from another source at no cost			0
supporters of the law also fear a high court setback on the contraception mandate will lead to other healthcare challenges on religious grounds , such as do - not - resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage			1
more broadly , many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment , safety , and civil rights			0
hundreds of advocates and demonstrators on both sides are expected to rally in front of the courthouse on @entity124			0
how will the court rule ? the justices have a good deal of discretion and could reach a " compromise " by interpreting the law narrowly			1
conservatives , in theory , have the five votes to strike or severely limit the contraception mandate			0
but some on the bench may worry about the long term impact in overruling large parts of a law passed by @entity140 , and now being carried out in stages			0
on the other hand , only one conservative justice who sides with the four more liberal members would be enough to give another huge legal boost to @entity2			1
liberals in general have criticized the conservative majority high court for being overly sympathetic to business interests			0
how did we get here ? this is the next chapter in the pitched legal fight over the @entity2 that was approved by @entity140 in 2010 without any @entity36 support			1
@entity32 and @entity157 allies moved forward to help provide insurance coverage for tens of millions of @entity159 without it			0
so far , 9 million people have signed up for benefits since last october , but republicans claim the program is too expensive and wo n't work			0
the first lawsuits challenging the healthcare overhaul began just hours after @entity32 signed it into law			0
the landmark june 2012 decision upheld key parts of @entity2 , ensuring that it would move forward just before the president 's reelection			1
nearly 50 pending lawsuits have been filed in federal court from various corporations challenging the birth control coverage benefits			0
but the @entity1 will have the final say on those with its decision on monday			0
a mennonite family 's fight over @entity2 reaches opinion : how @entity2 can reduce abortions court set to rule on @entity2 contraception mandate @entity71 : the beliefs behind the battle			1

the justices will rule on monday over the next challenge to @entity2
should employers offer health coverage for contraception if they object on moral grounds ?
companies appealing say doing so could ultimately lead to abortions , which they oppose
the case is n't as big as two years ago , but it does have political implications
