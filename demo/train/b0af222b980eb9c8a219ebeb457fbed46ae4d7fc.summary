-- at last the mystery has been solved			0
since a fan tweeted a picture of @entity4 and @entity5 outside @entity6 , which served as a stand - in monk 's on the hit @entity9 show " @entity4 , " there has been buzz about what it could mean			1
was it a @entity16 commercial ? something having to do with @entity4 's web series " @entity18 " ? or was it perhaps , like the sitcom , a whole bunch of nothing ? the answer is yes			1
in addition to the comic , the mini- " @entity4 " reunion included @entity5 , who played @entity28 on the show , and @entity30 , who played @entity31 the postal carrier			1
it turned out to be a bit of a commercial for @entity4 's " @entity18			2

the pair bantered about a friend 's @entity16 party and a discussion ensued about " over cheering " football games			1
then @entity4 's nemesis , @entity31 , showed up			0

though keep in mind " @entity4 " celebrates its 25th anniversary this year , so perhaps there is something more to the mystery after all .			0
