-- bolstered by a new poll that shows him leading in @entity3 and two other battleground states , president @entity5 on wednesday made his ninth campaign trip this year to the @entity3 to attack @entity10 rival @entity9 's tax plan as unfair to middle - class @entity11			1
in @entity3 , swing state politics have real - life impact @entity5 cited a report issued wednesday by the @entity18 - @entity17 that concluded @entity9 's proposals for tax reform would end up providing large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes			1
" he 's asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut , " @entity5 told more than 2,000 supporters in @entity25 , the first of two @entity3 stops wednesday			2
" we do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well			0
" @entity9 's campaign challenged the veracity of the study and blamed the president 's economic policies for a still - lagging economy			1
" president @entity5 continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending , " @entity9 spokesman @entity40 said in a statement			1
" we 've been down that road before -- and it 's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 %			0
" earlier , the @entity9 campaign launched a potentially risky ad challenging the @entity5 administration 's auto industry bailout , which is credited with saving @entity53 and @entity54			1
@entity9 @entity3 ad hits @entity5 over auto bailout with just over three months until the november election , the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy will take the country in the wrong direction			1
the @entity67 / @entity66 / @entity65 poll released wednesday showed @entity5 leading @entity9 in @entity3 , @entity68 and @entity69 , all of which are among the eight or so battleground states vital to either candidate 's chances for winning			1
poll : @entity5 over 50 % in @entity68 , @entity3 and @entity69 according to the survey , @entity5 holds a 50 % -44 % lead in @entity3 and a 51 % -45 % lead in @entity68 , which are considered toss - ups in november			2
the president is ahead 53 % -42 % in @entity69 , which is rated " leans @entity5 " on the @entity82			2
" if today were november 6 , president @entity5 would sweep the key swing states of @entity68 , @entity3 and @entity69 and -- if history is any guide -- into a second term in the @entity92 , " wrote @entity83 , assistant director of the @entity84 , in a statement accompanying the survey 's release			1
in a key finding that signaled possible trouble for @entity9 , the candidates were statistically even in all three states on the question of who would better handle the economy			0
@entity9 's main campaign theme is that he is more experienced and better able to bring economic growth than @entity5 , and his attacks on the president 's economic policies have been relentless			1
despite those attacks and unemployment above 8 % , @entity5 is neck - and - neck with the former @entity109 governor on the issue cited by voters as the most important to them			0
@entity112 , a political science professor at @entity114 , said before wednesday 's poll came out that the @entity9 campaign is " betting on economic dissatisfaction " to defeat @entity5			1
" if that were true , @entity5 's negatives would be much worse , " @entity112 said			0
" there 's obviously something else driving people 's support other than the economy			0
" @entity5 's visit to @entity3 showed the importance his campaign places on the state he won in 2008 over @entity10 candidate sen. @entity129			1
at events in @entity25 and @entity131 , @entity5 delivered a modified version of his usual stump speech emphasizing the need to restore the @entity11 dream of equal opportunity for all willing to work for it , adding a section on the report by the @entity17 set up by the @entity18 and the @entity17			0
study : @entity9 tax plan would shift burden toward poor @entity9 calls for 20 % cuts to today 's rates as well as eliminating the @entity145 and limiting current deductions , exemptions and credits available to top - level income earners			1
however , @entity9 has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate , and the @entity17 report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower - and middle - class @entity11			2
tax policy has become a central economic issue , with @entity158 deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the @entity162 - era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year			0
@entity5 calls for extending the current rates under the tax cuts for income below $ 250,000 for families and $ 200,000 for individuals , while letting the rates on income above those figures rise to 1990s levels			0
" if you 're fortunate enough to be in the other 2 % of @entity11 , all we 're asking you to do is contribute a little more , " @entity5 said wednesday			0
" this includes me , by the way			0
" @entity9 and @entity10 want to extend all the @entity162 tax cuts for now to prevent any increase , with both sides calling for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps			0
the issue touches on the foundations of the nation 's political divide , with republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while @entity192 want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs			0
in its study , the @entity17 did not score @entity9 's plan directly , saying it lacked sufficient details			2
instead , the center said @entity9 's plan represented a number of @entity10 proposals			2
" they found that if gov. @entity9 wants to keep his word and pay for his plan , then he 'd have to cut tax breaks that middle - class families depend on , " @entity5 said , listing mortgage deductions and health care deductions as examples			2
" that means the average middle - class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than $ 2,000			0
" the president made clear that he was relying on the study for the analysis and details , saying , " this was n't my staff ; this was n't something we did			0
" " folks making more than $ 3 million , the top one - tenth of one percent , would get a tax cut of a quarter of a million a year			0
think about that , " @entity5 said			0
the @entity9 campaign argued that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for additional revenue that would result from a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of @entity9 's plan			1
" ignoring the growth effects of corporate tax reform discredits the @entity17 immediately , " a @entity9 campaign representative said , adding , " by not including the substantial growth effects of the corporate side ( of ) reforms , the entire study is based on flawed assumptions			2
" also on wednesday , the @entity9 campaign released a television ad that criticized @entity5 for the auto bailout			1
titled " dream , " the spot features @entity250 , a car dealership owner from @entity252 , @entity3 , saying that under the bailout measure , " the dream ... that we worked so hard for was gone			0
" " i received a letter from @entity53			0
they were suspending my credit line			0
we had 30 - some employees that were out of work , " @entity250 says in the spot			0
@entity9 has argued the bailout was not the best solution to right the then - struggling auto industry , instead advocating a " managed bankruptcy " process that he said is what ultimately happened			1
@entity268 , a spokeswoman for the @entity5 campaign , said the @entity9 ad was surprising , adding that the president 's actions on the auto industry saved 2,200 dealership jobs in @entity3 alone			1
@entity5 's campaign has also aired advertisements focused on the auto industry bailout , including one in which an autoworker explains how the bailout helped him			1
@entity9 and the @entity281 have paid $ 8.2 million for a week of ad time in eight battleground states , which a @entity10 source who tracks ad buys called the largest amount spent on behalf of @entity9 so far in the general election media campaign			1
@entity9 , @entity281 make largest weekly ad buy last week , the @entity281 started spending some of the funds it is allowed to use to coordinate with the @entity9 campaign			2
this allows @entity9 's campaign to avoid spending some of its money but stay on the air as the candidate faces millions of dollars of ads from the @entity5 re-election campaign			1
@entity9 campaign officials have routinely refused to discuss the specifics of its ad spending or where its commercials are running			2
according to @entity0 's ad consultant @entity305 / @entity306 , the @entity9 ad talking about layoffs in the car industry is running in @entity3 while a new biography spot with @entity9 touting his business background is up in @entity313			1
the @entity5 campaign and the @entity315 , which started coordinating ad spending last week as well , bought $ 5.3 million of ad time in the same eight states between july 21 and august 3 , and a separate $ 3.5 million for commercials running for a week ending august 2			2
another new @entity9 ad wednesday hammered @entity5 over unemployment and other economic problems , saying : " @entity11 need a change			2
we need a new president			0
" @entity5 's campaign responded to the ad by citing @entity9 's opposition to the auto industry bailout			1
" let 's get this straight -- the very person who argued for the @entity11 auto industry to go bankrupt , something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the @entity337 , is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled ? " campaign spokeswoman @entity340 said in a written statement			1
@entity343 's @entity342 and @entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report .			0
