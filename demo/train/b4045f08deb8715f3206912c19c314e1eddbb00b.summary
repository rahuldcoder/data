-- " congratulations ! " people said when i told them i was pregnant with my first child			0
also , usually , " what 's your due date ? do you know what it is ? " and then , frequently -- and much to my surprise -- " what book are you reading ? " it turns out you ca n't just up and have a baby			1
many parents are now also subscribing to a particular parenting philosophy , often well in advance their little one 's emergence into the world			1
for a soon - to - be new mom , it was overwhelming			2
what was the right book ? should i stick with the philosophies that make obvious sense to me , or consider some that seem like more dramatic departures ? did i even need a book at all ? @entity31 , author of famed pregnancy guide " what to expect when you 're expecting , " argued recently that this quest for guidance in books and online is at an all - time high			1
in a @entity40 op - ed headlined " why i fear for modern mothers , " she wrote that it stems from pressure on parents to be the best			2
" @entity46 's race for the perfect parenting prize has become all - consuming , " she wrote			1
" whatever the group , everyone is locked in conflict and judging each other			0
" studying books on parenting is really no new phenomenon			1
ever since dr. @entity56 published " the @entity57 " in 1946 , parents have been reading up on the best way to raise their little ones			1
@entity56 's book was a parenting bible for many years , but also entertained its share of critics , from those who accused him of being anti-feminist , to those who claimed he fostered generations of spoiled brats , to those who blame him for an increase in violent crime			1
( kids who grew up thinking it 's ok to eschew broccoli probably also think it 's ok to steal someone 's car ... right ? ) but where once there was just @entity56 to follow ( or not , as the case may be ) , there are now hundreds of parenting books to choose from , most of which seem to ride the same popularity roller coaster as @entity56			1
a book might be celebrated one minute , but a few months down the line , a parent is a pariah for even having it on the shelf			2
parents run the risk of reading a book , only to find it widely discredited mere weeks later			2
it seemed i had to accept that while books differ on how to parent , they all seem to suggest there 's a right way to parent -- and they , the authors , know the secret			1
several friends lent me " @entity110 " by @entity111 , swearing by the schedule @entity108 delineates for parents			0
it includes , in some situations , letting your little one cry for a few minutes			0
but the idea of " crying it out " now has some detractors wringing their hands as it has become a subject of conflicting research findings			0
another book , @entity125 's " bringing up @entity124 , " touts the @entity127 system to raising an independent - minded child who allows you to sleep , have dinner or maybe even a conversation			1
no - brainer , right ? but the author also generated indignation , with one @entity136 writer even accusing her of pushing a socialist agenda and ruining all our hopes for future generations of tyke - oons			0
whether it 's @entity144 's push - your - kid method in " @entity145 , " dr. @entity142 ' let - your - kid - sleep - with - you plan , @entity149 's connection - before - correction or @entity152 's advice to just chill and have a martini , the messages are different -- but strangely the same : you can screw your kids up , or you can make them great			1
it 's all up to you , and whether you follow these wildly divergent instructions			1
argh - gulp panic - middle - of - the - night - cold - sweat - anxiety			0
what if i choose the wrong child guru and ruin my offspring ? can you mix and match philosophies ? what if by mixing and matching you just create some kind of a babymonster ? what if i ( gasp ) do n't read anything at all ? " in terms of controversies and the bombardment of information , [ the prevalence of so many conflicting parenting books ] is making things too complicated and very un-relaxing for parents " , says dr. @entity169 , who teaches at @entity171 's @entity170 and author of " the parents we mean to be			1
" in his book , @entity169 looks at the pathologies parents themselves bring to the table , rather than just examining ways to parent			2
the book also examines the idea of " over-parenting			2
" he believes many parents are too affected by " the @entity194			0
" not only are they feeling competitive in terms of what they 've read , but they worry that by not not taking the same approaches as other parents , they 're cheating their child out of opportunities			2
trying to the absolute best parent can actually be damaging to children , the books suggests , and possibly pointless : there are no blanket ways to parent and there is often no right or wrong approach , @entity169 argues			2
" books often tend to be too generic and get into all these debates , " he said			2
" it 's more like , ' who is my child and how can i be most constructive given what 's going on with them ? ' " @entity221 , in a " @entity220 " podcast , talks about how as a child he refused to take part in a gifted academic program at school , because it would interfere with his square - dancing classes			2
@entity221 's mom did not dissuade him , as some parents might have , and of course now he 's , well , @entity221			1
i wondered how @entity221 would have turned out if @entity144 was his mom ? or what a @entity231 raised in the @entity221 household would look like ? possibly not at @entity171 , like @entity144 , or on on " @entity234 , " like @entity221			2
" there are certain things that are fundamental and if you do them reasonably well , the chances are your kid will be fine , " @entity169 says			0
" spending time , being warm , listening , creating reasonable expectations , caring for people , caring for yourself			0
safeguarding your child 's health and knowing basic health information			0
" it sounds a lot like ... dr. @entity56			1
@entity56 tells parents in the first chapter : '' do n't be afraid to trust your own common sense			1
what good mothers and fathers instinctively feel like doing for their babies is usually best			0
" so , i do n't need a book ? no need to read chapter two ? just do whatever i think is best ? perhaps			1
@entity169 points out that this hyper - concern with reading parenting guides is largely divided among cultural and economic lines , and tends to be more of a middle - and upper - class issue			0
it 's not that parents do n't need guidance , he said , it 's about where that guidance comes from			0
he believes parenting in the @entity273 has become too private			0
parents will gladly read books , but balk at feedback from people they know			1
we 've all heard the line : " do n't tell me how to raise my child ! " the takeaway , according to @entity169 , is not to ignore parenting books altogether , which can sometimes offer practical tips , but that the best advice comes from those around you who know you and your little one			1
not only is your child unique , but parents might be bringing their own issues to the table , and those might need to be assessed on a case - by - case basis			0
consult a trusted pediatrician , consult people whose opinions you respect , consult your partner , @entity169 advises			0
find time to pause and reflect -- he advises , adding , " i think everybody has got to relax			0
" for me and my new life with a newborn , the most appealing books turned out to be those where i could find an answer quickly			0
in @entity306 's " @entity304 , @entity305 , " i skipped the chapters that explained why sleep matters -- that seems startlingly obvious -- and went straight to the week - by - week instructions			0
the standard " @entity312 's @entity311 " by the @entity313 and @entity31 's " what to expect ... " books have been very helpful			1
i relied quite heavily on the @entity315 to give a variety of answers , making sure to check any advice with my pediatrician			0
with a baby , i think it 's less about personality , more about practical help			0
i think the real market for parenting books is parents with older children			1
parents of babies reading about what kind of parent to be are probably , like me , likely to gravitate toward books that espouse theories they probably already believe			0
i read " bringing up @entity124 , " because it resonated with ideas i already have about parenting , like teaching kids to enjoy " grown - up " foods from an early age ( i might eat my words if my little one refuses everything but chicken fingers			1
) i like the idea of having a well - behaved child , as i imagine do most people			0
this is all very well and good in theory , but i think it 's important to read a book that 's realistic to the specific situation			1
even though i liked " bringing up @entity124 , " it just might not be appropriate if my child is exceptionally shy			0
if a child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , for example , then reaching for @entity144 's " @entity359 " may not be the best shot			0
when faced with parenting hurdles further down the line , there wo n't be one easy answer , one book with all the fixes			2
i like to think i 'll take the same approach i do as a journalist -- read several source , know what advice and opinions are out there , whether books , articles or conversations with other parents and my doctor			1
most important , i think , as dr. @entity56 advised years ago , i 'll go with my gut			1
what parenting books do you love or hate ? share your experiences in the comments or on @entity384 or @entity385 !			2

new mom @entity387 felt pressure to follow parenting ideas in different books
@entity387 : what was the right book ? ... did i even need a book at all ? "
she read several , likes some , but is sticking with dr. @entity56 's advice : " go with my gut "
