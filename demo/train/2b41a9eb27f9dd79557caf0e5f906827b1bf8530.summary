@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is in @entity0 , @entity1 working with the @entity4			1
@entity6 's 10th birthday : " i taught them how to play pin the tail on the donkey , although we replaced a donkey with a zebra , and i baked @entity6 a birthday banana cake			1
" the @entity4 is the only charity of its kind in the region and aims to provide teaching and support for local disabled children and teenagers			2
with the project @entity3 will be helping the teachers teach skills like woodworking , leatherwork and dressmaking			1
follow her experiences in her blogs and video diaries			2
november 14 , 2007 when i signed up to work at the @entity4 i was given the option of living in my own house or with a local family			1
i was really unsure of which to choose but decided to live with @entity37 and his family			1
i made this decision because i thought it would be good to experience how a @entity1 family live and i also hoped that @entity37 would take me under his wing , so to speak , and look out for me if i got into any trouble or encountered any problems			1
after being here for two months i have no doubt that i made the right decision			2
i really have been made to feel like part of the family and welcomed into their home as if it were my own			1
what i 've found really interesting is seeing the daily routines and how they differ to back home			0
simple activities like cooking , cleaning , shopping , etc. are all performed quite differently to the western world			0
i had anticipated that the food would be different , but if anything i 've been pleasantly surprised by what is on offer here			0
one thing i like is that you really know where your food has come from			0
if you want to eat chicken , you point to the one you want then kill it and pluck it yourself			1
if you want fish , a local fisherman will drop off his daily catch at your house			2
nothing is processed , artificial or vacuum packet			0
if i was living on my own i would have been surviving on fruit and veg for a year , as i had no idea how to gut a fish or skin a chicken			1
the girls have also taught me how to make chapattis and other traditional @entity1 dishes			0
i had n't thought about how i would wash my clothes for example			2
i did n't think they would have washing machines , but i had n't really thought it through			0
so every sunday i fill my basin up with water , some soap and get scrubbing			0
the family laugh at my attempts , it must be obvious i 'm not used to such hard work			2
this sunday was @entity6 's 10th birthday party so i got to join in the celebrations			1
she had about 20 of her friends around at the house , all of whom were dressed immaculately in beautiful dresses and suits			0
there were n't any expensive presents or entertainment like you 'd get back home but the kids seemed to have just as good a time			0
i taught them how to play pin the tail on the donkey , although we replaced a donkey with a zebra , and i baked @entity6 a birthday banana cake			1
people open their homes to visitors anytime of the day too			0
often when i return home the living room will be full of the neighbors			0
anyone is welcome to stay , even if a bed is not available , they just share one			0
i really am glad i decided to live with a family here			1

@entity3 chose to live with @entity134 and his family in @entity0
the family has given her an *insight* into everyday life in the country
she has learned how to pluck a chicken , gut a fish and *handwash* clothes
at @entity37 's daughter 's 10th birthday party , @entity3 teaches new games and bakes a cake
