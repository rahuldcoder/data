-- football clubs spend big money on big players to deliver on the biggest stage			0
and no doubt @entity6 view the $ 58 million they spent on @entity8 as a bargain after his heroics secured its passage to yet another @entity13 group stage			1
remarkably , a nervy 1 - 0 victory over @entity16 side @entity15 in the two - legged playoff tie means @entity19 's men will take their place in the draw for the 17th consecutive season			1
qualification also brings with it a $ 33 million windfall , meaning @entity8 has already paid off a large chunk of the fee it cost the club to prise him from @entity31 giants @entity30			1
now the @entity32 will line up alongside the cream of @entity34 , including @entity37 champions @entity35 and @entity39 champions @entity38 , in thursday 's draw			2
a relieved @entity19 told @entity41 : " we needed to keep our nerve but we kept our nerve , were united and showed great solidarity			0
" we wanted to be there and not go down a division in @entity34			0
we had chances to score more but in two games we kept a clean sheet and it made a difference			2
" asked if it was unthinkable for @entity6 not to qualify @entity19 said : " it is unthinkable until it happens			2
" for us it is a weight off our shoulders , we can now focus on the @entity57 and wait for the draw			0
we feel we have done the job and have our conscience clear			0
" @entity19 also confirmed striker @entity61 would be missing until at least december after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury , and said he would dip into the transfer market if he could find a forward of suitable quality			0
after a disappointing 0 - 0 draw in @entity16 last week , the first opportunity of the evening fell to @entity69 , but after pouncing on a loose ball when @entity8 was fouled , the @entity71 star fired wide of the target			1
former @entity75 striker @entity74 , who wasted several opportunities in the first leg , narrowly failed to poke the ball past @entity6 goalkeeper @entity78 as the @entity16 side showed they could still pose an offensive threat			1
and hearts were in mouths at the @entity83 when defender @entity84 slid in to tackle @entity85 and appeared to get only a marginal touch on the ball inside the penalty area			0
but just as the home fans began to express their agitation , @entity8 found the net			2
the @entity91 scampered into the area as @entity69 swapped passes with @entity39 @entity95 winner @entity94 , to fire low past @entity15 goalkeeper @entity96			2
@entity8 had a chance to double @entity6 's lead on 51 minutes after more neat approach play from @entity69 , the 22 - year - old sliding the ball to his @entity91 teammate only to see it stabbed wide of the far post			1
@entity74 had another chance to stall the @entity32 ' momentum as he turned inside the area , but his shot from a narrow angle could only find the side - netting			0
@entity6 then wasted two glorious chances to make the tie safe			2
with @entity15 pushing men forward , @entity6 broke and @entity8 drove into the penalty area before teeing up @entity116 , but the @entity118 's shot was blocked			1
seconds later @entity119 swung in a low cross and though @entity122 sneaked in front of his marker , he could only fire against @entity96 from six yards out			0
a nervy climax was ensured when @entity84 was dismissed for a second bookable offense with 15 minutes left , the defender remonstrating with the referee before trudging off			0
@entity74 failed to connect with a late header , and @entity6 were penned in as the @entity16 desperately sought the goal they needed , but they held on to seal victory			1
elsewhere , @entity31 side @entity132 came from behind to eliminate @entity133 , from @entity134 , and take its place in the @entity13 group stages for the first time in 16 years			1
@entity139 's @entity138 also progressed after a 7 - 2 aggregate victory over @entity142 outfit @entity141			1
@entity143 , of @entity144 , made the group stages for the first time after a fairytale penalty shootout victory over @entity148 's @entity147			1
after goalkeeper @entity150 was sent off in extra time , defender @entity149 donned the gloves as the tie finished 1 - 1 on aggregate after extra time			0
incredibly , @entity149 took his side 's opening penalty , and scored , before saving two of @entity147 's and sealing a remarkable victory for his side .			0

@entity8 seals @entity6 's progress to @entity13 group stages
it is the 17th consecutive season @entity6 have made the group stages of the *competition*
@entity8 's first goal for the club sees off @entity16 club @entity15 in their playoff tie
