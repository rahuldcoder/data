@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 government and rebel officials offered wildly disparate views of the situation on the ground sunday , as gunfire and explosions continued to rock @entity0 not far from the home of embattled leader @entity12			1
@entity13 , the ruler 's son and a top official in his regime , insisted on @entity1 state - run television that the rebels were losing every battle -- saying so hours after his father told supporters that the " traitors " and their @entity26 allies were lying and nearing their end			1
this perspective , however , contrasted with reports from @entity2 reporters , witnesses and rebel officials that government forces continued to lose ground all around the @entity35 nation and faced fresh attacks in the capital			0
@entity38 , political affairs chief for the rebel 's @entity39 , said early sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside @entity0 is " going easily " and they are inching toward @entity12 's @entity45 compound			1
" the revolution from inside @entity0 has officially started ( saturday ) evening in many parts ... of @entity0 , and is expected to spread to all of @entity0 , " @entity46 , a rebel spokesman from the western mountain region around @entity48 , said hours earlier			1
heavy clashes broke out saturday night in at least one neighborhood in @entity0 , marked by intense gunfire , explosions and people screaming as they ran through the street , a resident told @entity2			1
gunfire and explosions have become normal occurrences in the capital , but @entity2 personnel on the ground for weeks report that the fighting appeared to be among the most intense yet			0
" most of the neighhoods in @entity0 are rising up , " @entity46 said			2
but speaking just before midnight in @entity0 , government spokesman @entity66 insisted that all is safe and " in excellent condition			2
" he said that the @entity1 capital remains under government control , adding that the nearby highways remain open			2
he blamed small groups of " armed gangs " -- a term that @entity12 loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight saturday inside @entity0			1
he insisted that government forces had put down the fighters " within half an hour , " making the statement at the same time gunfire continued to crackle intermittently around the capital			0
about two hours later , @entity12 echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in @entity0 and beyond while predicting the six - month - long conflict would climax soon			1
in his audio address , broadcast on state - run tv , the @entity1 leader blasted the rebel " traitors " and the @entity26 forces backing them as unethical and intent on destroying the county and ruining lives			1
and as he had done in a speech six days earlier , he tried to rally citizens to his side			0
" a great thing , anyway , that despite the @entity103 air raids , you continue to be up in @entity0 , " he said , an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from @entity108			2
" march forward , march forward , march forward			0
" they have lost and used everything , and their last resort is their lying campaign			1
now , this is the ending , " he added			0
the rebel spokesman , @entity46 , claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in @entity0			1
he also said some @entity1 army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital 's airport , which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support			1
@entity66 , the government spokesman , denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting , as with the rest of @entity0 , it was safe and under the control of @entity12 's forces			1
@entity2 could not immediately confirm how significant the fighting was , including whether rebel fighters had taken control of any parts of the city , including the airport			0
@entity46 , the rebel spokesman , said the clashes in @entity0 were " planned by rebels inside @entity0 in the neighborhoods of @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 ... and other places			1
" this came after coordination with other @entity148 elements , added @entity38			0
@entity66 confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital , but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes			0
hours earlier , @entity1 deputy foreign minister @entity153 rejected rebel claims that the governments of @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 have been asked to accept @entity12 and his family			1
and @entity12 , in his speech early sunday morning , stated unequivocally that he is still in @entity1			1
officials from the @entity163 and @entity26 , whose forces have launched scores of strikes on @entity12 's forces , also said they have no indication the @entity1 leader is making preparations to leave			1
whatever his next move , international pressure on @entity12 appears to be growing			2
@entity158 -- @entity1 's western neighbor that , until now , had been neutral in the conflict -- joined a host of other nations in recognizing the @entity39 as @entity1 's legitimate government			2
a @entity163 official said friday that @entity12 might be preparing for a " last stand " in @entity0 as a months - long @entity26 air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances			1
a second @entity163 official said the longtime leader 's plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the @entity1 capital			2
the officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters			0
while uncertain of how upcoming events will unfold , @entity196 spokesman @entity195 said friday that @entity163 officials in @entity199 have been working with the @entity1 opposition " on exactly what it 's going to look like @entity202			2
" " impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , " @entity195 told @entity2			0
the fighting continues , meanwhile , on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of @entity211 , about 30 miles west of @entity0 and a major supply route to the capital			2
on saturday , it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of @entity211 after pushing @entity12 's forces beyond the east gate , according to @entity2 's @entity220 who is in the city			1
artillery fire could be heard , and mortars were launched toward @entity211 on saturday , she reported			0
rebel fighters told @entity220 that @entity26 had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city			2
@entity26 has not yet commented on that statement			0
@entity66 , the @entity1 government spokesman , said late saturday that @entity12 's forces are surrounding @entity211 and still control it			1
earlier , the rebels seized a major oil refinery in @entity211 and controlled only the western part of the city , said @entity234 , a rebel fighter			0
but @entity13 sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take @entity0			0
and he was emphatic that he , his father and their supporters would not surrender			0
" we are in our land , in our country , " he said			0
" we have no problem if it takes six months , one year or two years -- victory will be ours			0
this is our country , and we will not leave it			0
" @entity2 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity220 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0
