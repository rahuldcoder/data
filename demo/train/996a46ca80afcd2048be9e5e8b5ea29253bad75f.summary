-- the war between natives and immigrants is ending			1
it was a bloodless conflict fought not with bullets and spears , but with iphones and floppy disks			0
now the battle between the haves and have - nots can begin			2
the post-millennial " digital native , " a term coined by @entity13 author @entity12 in 2001 is emerging as the globe 's dominant demographic , while the " digital immigrant , " becomes a relic of a previous time			1

computers and handsets are becoming an extension of body and mind , creating a @entity55 - like population			2
@entity12 cites the 100 - meter runner @entity56 , an athlete with prosthetic legs , as an example of how technology is used to enhance our lives			1
he told @entity0 : " for humans , what used to be this body of flesh and bone , all that is now just the center ... being human is a moving target			0
" the human race and its struggle to keep up with technology @entity12 says that at no time in history has technology moved so fast			1
today the latest high - tech gizmos can be passe even before hitting the shop floors			2
in the past -- during the post-industrial revolution era , for example -- accelerating technology has plateaued			2

" he told @entity0 : " we are not going through a transition to another faze of stability , and that is the key point			0
people will always be behind now and that will be a stress they have to cope with			0
" the new norm connecting with one another in the modern world requires a knack for social networking and texting , which is the norm for the digital native			2
but for the immigrant , it can be akin to learning a whole new language			0
@entity12 illustrates his point with former director of the @entity119 @entity118			2
in november , he was embroiled in a scandal that revealed he had an affair with @entity122			0
the @entity123 uncovered the affair while it investigated e-mails that @entity122 allegedly sent to a @entity118 family friend , @entity125			0
@entity12 labels this naivety by immigrants as " digital stupidity " -- by assuming that when people decide to post online or send e-mails , they believe privacy is automatically applicable			1
" people get frightened by change and they should be			0
they need courage to face the future these days , especially those who feel left behind			0
" people adapt instinctively and humans are very good at that			0
the young people live in the context ; the older people see the changing context and struggle			0
" digital poverty as technology filters into every corner of the globe and tech cities spring up in some unlikely places from @entity150 to @entity151 , a new gulf is emerging to separate the digitally savvy from the disconnected : poverty			2
in @entity154 , over two - thirds of the population live on less than $ 2 a day , according to the @entity155			2
but a @entity157 report still says that mobile phones are more common than toilets , with nearly half of @entity154 's 1.2 billion population armed with a handset			0
@entity163 , a director at the @entity164 in @entity154 , told @entity0 that defining natives and immigrants by generation is a " serious concern			1
" according to @entity163 , @entity12 's views were formed from the " privileged " position of living in the @entity13 @entity163 added : " [ @entity12 's ] observations may describe a generation gap that the @entity13 faced , but if you transplant the same definition to other parts of the world , natives are sometimes indistinguishable from immigrants			1

the call of the developing world as mobile networks extend their reach and areas become increasingly urbanized , @entity188 tech companies are seeking to tap markets with large populations			0
last year , @entity195 phone maker @entity194 released a range of smart phones targeted at consumers in emerging markets , particularly in @entity200 , to compete with cheaper @entity202 devices			0

@entity163 told @entity0 : " just because young people have tech access in @entity154 , it does n't make them digital natives			1
" he added , " it creates digital outcasts -- people whose supposed problem of access to the world has been resolved			2
" @entity12 , however , believes a " networked planet " is a sign developing nations will soon close the digital divide			1
even those who do n't yet have the technology still know that it exists , and will have it before long			0
