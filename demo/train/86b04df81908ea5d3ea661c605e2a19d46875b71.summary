-- it 's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history , but @entity5 has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at @entity8 will be considered a success			1
so says his predecessor @entity10 , a man who waited more than three years for his first silverware at @entity12 before rewriting the record books			1
@entity8 's hopes of a 21st @entity16 title seem faint after saturday 's 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity19 , a result which left @entity5 ' men eight points behind leader @entity23 after only eight matches			1
however , @entity10 -- whose reign ended with a 13th @entity28 crown last season -- urged fans to be patient after a difficult start to this campaign			2
" for @entity5 , winning a trophy would be a fantastic achievement , " the 71 - year - old told the club 's @entity35 channel in an interview aired saturday			1
" no matter what it is -- the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity28			0
we 've always had priorities obviously , and @entity5 is aware of that , but i hope he achieves it			2
" he has great support at the club			0
the most important person in the club is the manager and that must always be sacrosanct			2
in fairness , the club have always stuck by that rigid belief			0
" @entity5 , who did win the pre-season @entity58 match , was boosted ahead of the @entity19 match when teen sensation @entity60 signed a new five - year contract			1
the 18 - year - old , who underlined his status before the international break as one of the game 's hottest young prospects with two goals in his first @entity28 start , was again to the fore as @entity8 dominated the first half			1
@entity60 sent @entity72 clear on goal and , although the @entity76 striker 's shot was saved by @entity77 , @entity78 fired home from the rebound			2
@entity60 was also denied by @entity77 , and another well - timed pass found @entity82 -- but the forward could not set up @entity72 for the second			2
" we have been trying to get him signed for quite a few months , not just in my time , " @entity5 said of the @entity86 - born winger			1
" he 's an exceptionally talented player			0
he has not looked out of place in the team			0
he has created goals and been part of some of our best passing movements			0
" however , @entity8 's defensive frailties were once again exposed as @entity98 diverted in a scrambled shot from @entity100 in the 89th minute to deny @entity5 successive wins for the first time since joining from @entity103			1
" we should probably have put the game to bed earlier , " @entity5 said			2
" we hit the bar and had a couple of other opportunities			0
" it was a mixed game at times , but we still had those chances that i was hoping we would finish off			0
" by contrast , @entity23 romped to a comprehensive 4 - 1 win at home to @entity116 that put @entity118 's team two points clear of @entity120 and @entity121			1
record signing @entity122 scored twice after @entity125 's opener , and fellow midfielder @entity126 added his ninth goal in all competitions this season			2
@entity120 came from behind to beat promoted @entity130 4 - 1 , as former african player of the year @entity131 scored his first goal for the @entity134 side since joining from @entity136 's @entity135 in august			1
however , the @entity139 striker 's cheeky dispossession of @entity140 when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed @entity143 to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left @entity130 boss @entity146 fuming			0
" i did go in to ask for clarification of the ruling and what the referee and linesman saw , " he said			0
" the explanation leaves me really disappointed -- they felt the goalkeeper dropped the ball			0
my goalkeeper bounced the ball			0
he saw @entity131 standing next to him and he bounced the ball			0
" @entity120 manager @entity159 refused to attend his press conference after being sent to the stands in the second half after protesting about @entity130 's alleged time - wasting			1
@entity131 had put @entity120 ahead by that stage , while @entity165 and @entity143 wrapped it up after @entity159 's dugout exit			1
@entity121 briefly went top after being held 2 - 2 by 10 - man @entity167 in saturday 's early match , with striker @entity170 heading a 72nd - minute equalizer			0
the home side twice led , through @entity173 and @entity174 , despite having @entity175 sent off for a foul on @entity177 -- from which @entity178 netted a penalty for @entity121 's first leveler			0
in the late match , @entity182 won away for the first time this season , beating @entity186 3 - 1 thanks to a double from @entity188 to move above @entity19 into fourth place			1
sixth - placed @entity103 joined @entity19 on 15 points with a 2 - 1 win at home to promoted @entity193 , while @entity194 crushed @entity195 4 - 0 to give new manager @entity196 a losing start to his tenure at the @entity28 's bottom club , and there was a 0 - 0 stalemate between @entity202 and @entity203 .			1

@entity8 eight points off @entity206 after drawing 1 - 1 at home to @entity19
@entity10 urges patience with his successor as manager , @entity5
@entity122 scores twice as @entity23 takes two - point lead with 4 - 1 win over @entity116
@entity159 sent to stands as second - placed @entity120 wins by same score
