@entity0 , @entity1 -- an amusement park sits in the ear of a rhinoceros ; a five - star hotel takes the place of its eye			1
another city takes the awkward image of a giraffe , with a golf course on its chest and a sewage treatment plant on its tail			2
the government of @entity1 this week unveiled urban blueprints to rebuild cities in the shape of animals , raising eyebrows across the globe			1
the man behind the plan , @entity25 and @entity24 undersecretary @entity23 , says the attention has given his ambitious proposal a boost of new energy			2
" the reaction has been very good			2
we have been getting calls from everywhere , " @entity23 says in the @entity1 capital of @entity0			1
" generally , the feedback we are receiving indicates that we are on a positive track			2
" the $ 10.1 billion multi-decade project to re-create @entity1 's 10 state capitals into elaborately - shaped dream towns may sound dubai-esque -- only @entity1 is no @entity41			1
actually , it is one of the poorest places on earth			1
the undeveloped region -- which lacks any paved roads outside its three main cities -- is part of @entity51 's largest nation , @entity1 , which is ruled by the @entity53 government @entity1 fought against for most of the past half century in two long civil wars			1
but @entity1 expects to achieve independence next year through a january secession referendum promised in a 2005 peace deal that granted the war - torn region self - rule until the vote			1
even without the unique city designs , the multi-billion dollar price tag alone was sure to turn heads			2
@entity1 's total budget for 2010 is less than $ 2 billion , 98 percent of which comes from the oil revenues it hopes will fund its postwar re-construction			1
critics think @entity1 's expected oil bonanza could be getting to its head			1
" there are so many priorities they should be focusing on before they should be attempting such a thing			0
it 's not cost effective , " says @entity75 , 28 , a @entity1 living on a dirt road in @entity0 where the city 's erratic electricity supply has yet to reach			1
" there is a lot to address -- in health , education , infrastructure			0
" others think the idea could help put an aspiring new nation on the map			0
" if it happened , everybody would come to see the country			0
it would mean we are developed , " says @entity93 , 27 , who works in a @entity0 restaurant			0
but @entity93 says his government should budget for more pressing matters first			0
" if they build these and we still do n't have hospitals or proper schools or good roads , that would not be good , " he says			0
@entity23 defends his plan , saying that one must start planning for the future today			0
and for those who consider the giraffe or rhino city designs silly or impractical , they should think bigger , says the official , who holds a doctorate in civil engineering from @entity114 in the @entity115			0
" the shapes are what is innovative about the whole idea , that is what is attracting all the attention , " @entity23 says			0
eventually , the government hopes to get more than 70 percent of the project financed privately			2
businessmen from @entity124 and @entity125 have already flown in to discuss joining the investor pool since the plans were unveiled			0
the proposal has yet to be finally approved by the nation 's executive cabinet , and investors will not begin work until a $ 500 million guarantee materializes from the @entity134			1
but the man who envisions giving @entity1 a unique aerial view is confident his idea will soon turn stones on the ground			1
" we are implementing the plan , definitely , " he says .			0
