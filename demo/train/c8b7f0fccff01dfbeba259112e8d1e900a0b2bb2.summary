@entity1 gov. @entity0 and others are lashing out at president @entity4 's decision not to tour border facilities overwhelmed by a flood of undocumented children , saying the @entity9 leader needs to see with his own eyes what both sides agree is a humanitarian crisis			1
" the @entity9 people expect to see their president when there is a disaster , " @entity0 told @entity15 's @entity14 in an interview that aired thursday , citing @entity4 's trip to the @entity18 to tour damage caused by @entity20 in 2012			1
" he showed up at @entity20			0
why not @entity1 ? " both @entity25 and the @entity26 have described the crush of @entity29 children as a humanitarian crisis , but @entity4 said wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity			1
" there 's nothing that is taking place down there that i am not intimately aware of and briefed on			2
this is a problem , " @entity4 said wednesday			1
the controversy has been compared to president @entity44 's initial decision not to tour the storm - ravaged @entity45 after 2005 's @entity47			1
@entity44 opted instead to fly over the coast in @entity49 , resulting in a famous picture of the president peering down at the devastation from his jet			1
it left many feeling that @entity44 was detached and uncaring			1
@entity44 later acknowledged that failing to land and at least express solidarity with victims was a mistake			1
@entity0 alluded to that wednesday in an interview on the @entity60 " @entity61			0
" " i 'm pretty sure that if @entity44 had said , ' well i sent my @entity67 director multiple times , ' he still would have been criticized greatly , " he told " @entity61 , " according to a report on the network 's website			1
" because you need to go			0
that 's what governors do , that 's what presidents do , " @entity0 said			2
" when there are natural disasters , when there are crises like these , a president needs to be there to show the @entity9 people , no. 1 , that he understands			2
" ' go down there and see what we 're facing ' even some @entity88 were critical of the decision			2
@entity9 rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , said on @entity15 's " @entity92 " that it 's important for @entity4 to see what the children are going through			1
" i 'm interested in him looking at the kids			0
the kids that i 've talked to , little innocent little boys and girls that have come across and have traveled over 1,000 miles , that one - third of the girls have been abused and raped on the way up here , " he said			0
" the last young kid was an 11 - year - old little boy from @entity107 that died of dehydration			0
that is the face that i want him to see			0
do n't take any cameras , mr. president , but go down there and see what we 're facing			2
" @entity4 has called on @entity117 to quickly approve his request for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding to deal with the crisis , which has seen thousands of undocumented children crossing the border without their parents			1
many have surrendered themselves to @entity126 officers on the belief they will be allowed to stay in the country , and officials have struggled to house the children amid a staggering backlog of immigration cases			0
@entity4 said wednesday that " the problem here is not a major disagreement around the actions that could be helpful in dealing with the problem			1
" the challenge he said , is whether @entity117 is prepared to " put the resources in place to get this done			0
" " are folks more interested in politics , or are they more interested in solving the problem ? " he said			0
is the immigration crisis @entity0 's second act ? process overwhelmed the surge of undocumented youths from @entity29 has overwhelmed federal facilities and revived the debate over an immigration policy overhaul , one of the most partisan issues in the already overheated political climate of an election year			1
@entity9 authorities estimate that 60,000 to 80,000 undocumented children will cross the border without their parents this year			2
while many have been released to family pending deportation hearings , others have been detained by authorities amid a growing backlog of pending cases			0
@entity4 administration officials blame the influx on dire conditions in countries such as @entity107 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
critics , however , say the administration invited the problem by halting deportations of some young immigrants who arrived illegally in past years			0
" the children are a symptom of policies that have enticed them to come , " @entity0 said			0
" the first thing you have to do is stop the flow , because if we do n't , then the problem 's not going to be the size we have today			2
" @entity25 have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by president @entity44 that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the @entity9			1
" i do n't think we can solve the problem unless we revisit " the law , @entity1 @entity193 sen. @entity193 said			2
" what 's happened is these children are placed with family members in the @entity9 and given a notice to appear for a later court hearing			2
some have called this a notice to disappear , not a notice to appear , " as most do n't show up , he said			0
another @entity193 , sen. @entity205 of @entity206 , said the @entity9 should immediately fly the children back to their home countries			0
it would cost less and signal @entity9 intolerance for those who enter the country illegally , he said			0
funding request @entity4 's emergency funding request seeks $ 1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts as well as crack down on smugglers			1
another $ 300 million would go to help @entity219 and @entity29 governments counter claims by smugglers to desperate parents that @entity9 officials wo n't send their children back			0
" while we intend to do the right thing by these children , their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay , " @entity4 said			2
the request also includes $ 1.8 billion to provide care for unaccompanied children crossing the border			1
the request is about 10 % of the $ 30 billion in proposed border security funding included in the immigration reform bill passed by the @entity238 but stalled in the @entity25 - controlled @entity26			1
@entity0 said lawmakers are n't going to back @entity4 's funding request if the government does n't act to stop policies they see as encouraging children to show up at the border			1
he told @entity4 in a meeting that he wants 1,000 @entity247 troops deployed to help secure the border , an option @entity4 seemed less than enthusiastic about			1
" what i told him was we 're happy to consider how we could deploy @entity247 down there , but that 's a temporary solution , " @entity4 said of his discussion with @entity0			1
" that 's not a permanent solution			0
and so why would n't we go ahead and pass the permanent solution , or at least a longer - term solution ? " it was unclear how much cooperation @entity4 will get from congressional republicans on his funding request			2
a spokesman for @entity26 speaker @entity264 said the request would be considered			0
@entity193 and @entity90 plan to introduce legislation thursday to repeal the 2008 deportation hearing law			0
the bill , @entity90 said , will include protections for children who come to the @entity9 because of concerns about drug or sex trafficking			0
@entity88 want to keep the law intact to ensure that children who deserve asylum receive a full hearing			0
