-- conventional thinking is that every race in every campaign cycle comes with a debate between the candidates			1
an increasingly informed , technoliterate electorate threatens to make debates an endangered species , however			1
in a few cases , at least , that 's for the best			2
if only all debates were presidential debates , with serious candidates discussing critical issues in front of the world 's news media			1
presidential level debates set a high bar to test prospective leaders of the free world			1
on the state and congressional levels , debates regularly offer less nourishing fare			1
in less headline - grabbing state and federal contests , political debates have often become empty theater , scripted to be meaningless and do everything but inform voters			1
in some campaigns , debates can even distort the real picture by lending credibility to candidates who do n't merit it -- candidates who by their own mistakes have no chance at success			1
this year , there is no better example than @entity45 , where incumbent @entity47 gov. @entity46 is leading his @entity49 challenger , @entity51 executive @entity50 , by a healthy margin -- after @entity50 spectacularly imploded , effectively destroying himself , his campaign staff and all political life in his vicinity			1
though we once expected to see a hotly contested governor 's race in @entity45 , @entity46 's solid , first - term economic performance scared off better challengers and left the @entity61 with the less - than - top - tier option of @entity50			1
just how " less " became evident when news surfaced that police found him in his car in a parking lot at 4:30 a.m. with a woman who was n't mrs. @entity69			2
just when you thought it could n't get worse for @entity50 , @entity45 then learned that he had gone 10 years without a driver 's license , including while he was a public official , using official cars and overseeing the firing of employees who did n't meet requirements of having a driver 's license			1
no wonder late - night talk show hosts love the endless fount of material known as politics			0
it 's no surprise that @entity61 have abandoned @entity50			0
he 's shifted much of his funds to support other races by @entity61 candidates and the media has ratcheted down coverage of the @entity45 governor 's race			1
in this environment , a flailing candidate has nothing to lose by going into a debate only to serve himself , not voters , and cause trouble			0
@entity50 will not be the next governor of @entity45 , so voters wo n't appreciably benefit from being informed on his positions , whether policy or personal			1
in fact , having mismanaged his campaign so badly , his only goal would be to toss a few bombs to win favor with @entity61 bosses in hope they might mercifully bestow a patronage job on him after november			1
i would not argue for a campaign in which an incumbent is subject to less scrutiny or fewer probing questions from the news media			1
if @entity117 runs for president and her only opponent is sen. @entity120 , there 's a good argument for her to agree to debates			1
however , let 's get real : it is no great public service to allow a doomed and desperate candidate to turn a serious debate into a food fight			0
there is a difference between urging a candidate to face appropriate public scrutiny and asking him to become a dartboard			0
in an environment charged with desperation , a debate sometimes does nothing to enlighten or inform voters			0
as someone who has spent a good 40 years directing political campaigns , i 'd urge @entity46 not to debate and , instead , stand before the voters and press directly			0
the likelihood of personal attacks and water - muddying is so assured that it would be better -- for @entity46 , voters , the dignity of the process and the dignity of the position -- to cut out the debate theatrics and help voters better understand what their governor plans for his second term by standing before them in open forums such as town halls			1
instead of watching a debate , i 'd urge voters to spend an evening on the @entity162 , reading news stories and digesting analyses by independent groups			0
there 's a lot voters should still learn			0
skipping debates when they move from real discussions to farce is not uncommon			1
former @entity172 house speaker @entity171 -- hardly a shrinking violet -- has refused debates , as has former @entity176 gov. @entity175 , also not one to shy away from a fight			2
former @entity179 gov. @entity178 did it too , taking a pass on sharing a stage with a perennial gadfly universally regarded as a less than serious candidate			0
they were all , of course , criticized for their decisions but were none the worse for wear , in part because they were known quantities , whose performance and policies had stood the test of time and had already been scrutinized and evaluated by voters			0
alternative methods for delivering information were available to voters then and democracy survived			0
how much more is that true today ? conventional political debates are but one potential victim of the disruptive nature of technology			2
the depth of information available at our fingertips today , from our laptops and mobile devices , is astounding			0
can debates play an ongoing role -- perhaps even enhanced by technology ? of course they can			2
@entity0 has been a leader in modernizing debates , turning them into two - way communications events , connecting voters not only with candidates but also with each other			2
now it 's nearly impossible to watch a presidential debate without tweeting about it with our friends			2
the days of relying on only a few static pillars of voter education -- debates and newspaper endorsements , for example -- are over			2
old institutions that monopolized information are being forced to compete and adapt or face replacement			0
amidst today 's information deluge , voters are increasingly able to find the information that best serves them , and we 're all the better for it			0
candidates who embrace this type of change are no less accountable or responsive to the scrutiny inherent in elections			0
in fact , they are more so and stand to be better rewarded by voters who seek leaders to guide them to a better world			0
join us on @entity253 / @entity252 .			0

@entity255 : we need presidential debates , but some for state office are a waste
@entity255 : in @entity45 , a challenger to governor saw campaign effectively implode
he asks : should an incumbent get in the ring with a *hopelessly* *outmatched* competitor ?
