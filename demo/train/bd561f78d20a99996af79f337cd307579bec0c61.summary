@entity0 , @entity1 -- some @entity1 amusement park visitors may enjoy space - themed roller - coasters , but the first vehicle they board at @entity7 may be the most futuristic ride of their vacation			1
four hydrogen shuttle buses are part of the fleet at the @entity7			1
the airport is testing four @entity15 shuttle vans equipped with internal combustion engines modified to run on hydrogen instead of gasoline			1
" it 's quiet , it does n't shake like diesel , it does n't have that diesel smell , " said @entity19 , who has been driving the vans for a year			0
the quieter engine makes conversation inside the bus easier than in conventional vehicles			2
" @entity31 is one of the many technologies we are exploring , trying to become more of a green airport , " said @entity30 , director of airport operations			2
vehicles powered with hydrogen engines are different from the many vehicles across the nation that run with the help of hydrogen fuel cells -- which are the gold standard of green machines			1
the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines is far less efficient than in the fuel cells			1
the modified engines aboard the @entity49 450 shuttle buses are 6.8 liter v - 10s			1
the airport 's fleet also includes three gas - electric hybrid vehicles and 24 biodiesel buses			2
the facility also powers its maintenance equipment -- such as lawnmowers and tractors -- with biodiesel			0
but like many experiments with alternative fuels , the price is very high and the long - term outcome is unknown			0
proponents of hydrogen technology have long had a chicken - and - egg dilemma over whether to build million - dollar fueling facilities or to wait until more vehicles are in use			1
energy companies are reluctant to pour money into expensive fueling stations without a lot of hydrogen vehicles around , but consumers are not likely to buy a vehicle without adequate places to fill up			1
" it is clear nothing is going to displace gasoline or diesel for 20 , 30 , maybe 40 years , " said @entity78 , who has been working on alternative fuels at @entity15 for more than 20 years			0
the @entity7 project has several goals : to get average consumers acquainted with hydrogen and to acquire data on the buses ' performance in a setting where they are in use almost nonstop			1
@entity78 said it 's an effort to use a technology that customers take for granted ( the internal combustion engine ) , while preparing for the day when drivers can complete the divorce from fossil fuels			1
at the @entity102 in @entity7 , the hydrogen is produced on - site			1
" we are doing a process called steam methane re-forming , which is natural gas to hydrogen , " said @entity103 , manager of biofuels and hydrogen at @entity106 , one of the players involved in the project			0
during a careful fueling process , technicians check for leaks of the highly flammable hydrogen -- leaks both in the bus and the fuel pump			2
because a fossil fuel , methane , is used to make the hydrogen , the buses are about 12 percent cleaner than gasoline or diesel when their entire carbon footprint is measured			2
" we view the hydrogen efforts as a technical success , " said @entity103			0
" this is the first time we have been able to demonstrate actual production of hydrogen at the station			0
it 's not necessarily an economic success yet			0
" " the ultimate goal is hydrogen fuel cell cars , " @entity103 said			1
" the hydrogen internal combustion engine buses are much less expensive to manufacture , but they consume a lot more hydrogen			1
" @entity103 said the buses are " valid transition technology " aimed at quickly building significant demand for hydrogen , which would then justify an expensive infrastructure			0
the hydrogen test project also includes the @entity146 , @entity15 , the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
hydrogen buses began shuttling @entity149 employees in february from the park 's outer parking lots to their workplaces			0
" the environment is really an important part of @entity149 's culture here , " said @entity155 , director of environmental health and safety at @entity158 theme parks @entity149 , @entity159 and @entity160			0
@entity155 described the venture as another opportunity for " employees to feel like they can impact the environment by using this kind of vehicle , that will lessen our footprint on the world			0
" @entity149 's @entity159 animal training supervisor @entity173 said " somebody has to get the ball rolling			0
until somebody takes that first step , there 's always going to be the ' what if ? ' " airport operations director @entity30 said being in on the hydrogen experiment early could pay off in the long run			2
" we are hopeful that since they built the facility here , the only one in the southeast @entity185 , that there will be a long - term usage for it			2

@entity7 airport tests cleaner hydrogen - powered internal combustion engines
smoother , quieter engines require million - dollar fueling stations
testers hope to learn more by *gathering* data from nonstop shuttle usage
hydrogen engines *cheaper* than hydrogen fuel cells , but they use more hydrogen
