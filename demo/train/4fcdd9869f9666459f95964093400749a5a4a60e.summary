@entity0 -- a year that began in uncertainty for @entity4 ended with a historic title for the 17 - time grand slam champion and his country			1
when @entity4 defeated @entity12 of @entity13 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 2 in front of another record crowd sunday , it gave @entity4 a maiden @entity15 title at the not so tender age of 33			1
the visitors prevailed 3 - 1 in the best - of - five match series			1
@entity20 had never before won team tennis ' most prestigious event , playing in one previous final in 1992 when @entity4 was merely 11			1
" for me personally , obviously i 'm unbelievably happy because i 've been playing in this competition for probably almost 15 years now , " @entity4 told reporters as he sat among his teammates			2
" at the end of the day i wanted it more for the guys			0
" this is one for the boys			0
" with @entity4 committing to every round of the @entity15 this season -- unlike in years past -- and the emergence of compatriot @entity36 , it greatly boosted @entity20 's chances of success			1
@entity4 thus concluded 2014 with one of the biggest titles to elude him and a ranking of no. 2 , a considerable achievement given back issues largely contributed to his ranking slipping to eighth in january			0
indeed , some wondered -- with justification -- if @entity4 could ever come close to recapturing his old form			0
he did , and @entity4 was sharp saturday in doubles alongside @entity36 and then dominant against @entity12 in @entity0 , northern @entity13			1
only one week ago @entity4 was , according to @entity50 , a " question mark " for the @entity15 final after he withdrew from the final of the @entity54 in @entity55 against the no. 1 with further back troubles			1
his name was included in the @entity15 draw thursday , ensuring one of the highest profile finals in recent memory , but @entity4 suffered his most lopsided loss in the competition friday against @entity65			1
the positive , he insisted afterwards , was that his body felt fine as the match progressed , and his words ultimately were not a smoke screen			0
to say that @entity4 toyed with @entity12 would n't be much of a stretch			1
@entity12 , 2 - 12 versus @entity4 entering the match , started with an emphatic hold , but that was as good as it got for the prodigy who has never quite delivered			1
" you saw how well @entity4 was playing , how he just killed @entity12 today , " said @entity36			1
@entity12 , replacing the injured @entity77 , was broken for 2 - 1 , which set the tone			1
@entity4 lost just 14 points on his own serve and did n't face a break point			0
evidencing how well his back must have been feeling , he soared and stretched to put away a smash with venomous side spin in the second set			0
there was deft touch to seal the tie , @entity4 executing a half - volley drop shot before falling onto the clay at the @entity92 @entity91			2
he joined the likes of @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 in winning a @entity15 plus all four majors			0
unlike in majors , when players usually make the trek to their box after a title , in the @entity15 the team habitually floods the court			2
" it was definitely one of the better feelings in my career , no doubt about it , " he said			0
" so much nicer to celebrate it all together			0
" so thanks for running up to me and screaming in my ear			0
" though he applied the knockout blow , @entity36 's performance this weekend should n't be forgotten , and @entity4 took note			1
he crushed @entity77 to give @entity20 its first point friday and combined wonderfully with @entity4 in the doubles , his raw power a fine accompaniment to the artistry of @entity4			1
if he harbored any animosity towards @entity4 for reportedly being taunted by @entity4 's wife , @entity124 , last week at the @entity54 , he did n't show it			0
@entity36 's season began in superb fashion with a first grand slam title in @entity128 and sunday ensures it terminates well , following some bumps in between			2
" it is an exceptional year for me , " said @entity36			0
but what to make of the @entity13 ? the brief fireworks produced inside the stadium after @entity20 's win provided more electricity than anything produced by @entity77 or @entity12 on the court			1
about 90 percent of the record crowd of 27,448 for a pro tennis match sunday were @entity13 fans , but they barely had an opportunity to get into the match			2
over the three days , @entity13 claimed one set in the matches it lost			2
" the @entity13 team said they were ready to go to war , if i can quote them , " @entity36 said			1
" what happened was totally the opposite			0
" @entity77 said a lingering arm injury returned friday and the pain intensified following his outing against @entity36 , yet the @entity13 no. 1 has not had a good year -- barring one tournament in @entity156			1
@entity12 has never had the reputation of being a clutch player -- his play in doubles and against @entity4 wo n't help to shed the label			1
and so @entity13 's drought , at least on the men 's side , continues			0
a generation that promised plenty and was so determined to win the @entity15 this year for a tennis loving nation has underachieved			2
@entity13 , in an atypical luxury , contested all four of its series this year at home but was still unable to snap a 13 - year drought			2
" if you look at the tie as a whole , you can see that the @entity20 players are at a higher level than us , " @entity13 captain @entity173 told reporters			2
" they 're top ( two ) and top four of the world			0
we prepared for that as much as we could			0
but we knew that beating them would need an exceptional performance			0
" when @entity36 was asked for a percentage regarding his availability for @entity20 's opening tie against @entity191 next year , he replied , " i think the percentage we 're going to drink alcohol tonight is very high			2
" if the @entity13 players were to drink some alcohol , it would be for different reasons .			0

@entity20 wins its first @entity15 title after @entity4 routs @entity12
the @entity20 win the series 3 - 1 in @entity0 to *disappoint* most of the large crowd in northern @entity13
@entity4 has won almost everything in his career , just missing an @entity208 singles gold
he got support from @entity36 , who shone in his two matches this weekend
