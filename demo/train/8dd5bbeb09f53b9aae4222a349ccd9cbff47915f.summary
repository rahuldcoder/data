@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 swigs from his badly concealed bottle of red wine on a chilly street corner in the @entity1 city of @entity0 before deciding the question was something between a joke and an insult			1
" why have we come here ? " he asks tetchily before offering his bottle , sloppily wrapped in a blue plastic bag			0
he is wearing a black and white football shirt			0
" @entity16 is like a nation , a religion ... people are borrowing money from banks , from relatives to come here			1
they are quitting their jobs , selling their bikes , their cars , even their fridges			0
" sports fans are no strangers to sacrifice in the name of the teams they love and for the fans of @entity32 champions @entity16 no sacrifice is big enough			1
but forsaking the ability to chill your food is another level entirely			0
the current @entity39 champions are in @entity1 for the @entity40 , an annual tournament that brings together all six continental champions , including @entity43 , the @entity44 winners of this year 's @entity45			1
but unlike the other teams , who have brought a few thousand at most , 30,000 @entity16 fans had turned up in @entity0 , bathing the city in black and white , to watch their semifinal clash against the @entity52 champions @entity51 of @entity53			1
" it is natural for us to travel to watch @entity16 , " explains @entity3 , who unlike his compatriots , has booked his trip as a vacation			1
" my boss knows i 'm here			0
but even if he did n't we 'd still be here ... if we have to go to @entity1 ok			1
if we have to go to @entity43 to play at @entity60 , ok			1
we 'll be 30,000 there			0
" unloved the @entity40 is little loved by @entity63 teams ; seen as no more than a mid-season annoyance given the travel involved			1
but in the rest of the world the tournament is taken very seriously indeed			0
an incredible 15,000 fans turned up at the airport just to see the team off			2
more than 200,000 @entity32 live in @entity1 and the @entity1 government issued record numbers of visas to @entity32 for the tournament , a sign not just of @entity32 's well - known soccer passion , but also its growing global economic and political might			1
@entity32 will host the next @entity40 and the next @entity80 too			1
the effect of both can already be felt			0
" we were in the second division five years ago , " explains @entity83 , one of several thousand noisy @entity16 fans singing songs on the @entity86 on the way to the match , much to the puzzlement and amusement of the @entity1 commuters			1
he had taken a 25 - hour flight via @entity94 to be here			0
" the government has given us a stadium , which opens in 2013			0
the first game of the @entity40 will be played there			1
they sold a lot of advertising on the shirts , we get money from television network @entity103 for the tv so @entity16 is rising up			1
" @entity16 has one advantage , the [ former ] president of @entity106 is a fan of @entity16			1
so we got a lot			0
we have poor fans and then very rich men as fans			2
we have a new organization			0
" the prodigal son returns but equally as important was the return of @entity32 's prodigal son			1
in 2009 @entity116 returned to @entity32 and played for @entity16			1
@entity32 had always been a net exporter of footballing talent			1
so much so that @entity40 had to change its rules on national team eligibility to prevent countries around the world filling their squads with naturalized @entity32			1
but when the big names started returning home -- the likes of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 -- on wages comparable to those in @entity132 , it sent a message to the rest of the world that @entity32 , and @entity32 football , was changing			2
" after he [ @entity116 ] came , the club rose a lot , " agrees @entity83			0
" young people started supporting us , even people from other teams			0
they were supporting @entity16 and @entity116			2
it was a beautiful story for everybody			0
" second time lucky this is n't the first time that @entity16 has appeared in the @entity40			1
they won the inaugural tournament in 2000 as hosts			0
but this is the first year they have appeared as @entity39 champions after winning the @entity154 for the first time			2
the club 's roots can be found thousands of miles away from its native @entity157 in a small amateur football club			2
in 1910 the @entity44 club @entity16 traveled to @entity32 on a tour to bring football to the masses			1
the game , and the name , stuck			0
" many teams form @entity32 want to win this @entity40 so it is very important for us , " says @entity83			1
" the team is for the poor people			0
they are crazy for the team and follow the @entity16 all around the world			2
" sure enough , the @entity171 in @entity0 is covered in the club 's colors			2
a huge @entity175 flag -- a reminder of the club 's @entity178 roots , bastardized in black and white -- flies behind one of the goals			2
the match is like a home game for @entity16 , who win 1 - 0 thanks to @entity188 's goal			1
however , it 's not the best performance with @entity51 dominating the second half			0
" we were dominating the game in the first half and this was because of the supporters			0
we had to respond to them , " @entity16 coach @entity197 admitted after the match			2
" thanks to the supporters we were able to show our style			0
" @entity16 ' 12th man proved to be the difference			2
" the @entity63 do n't give the @entity40 much attention			2
we are the 12th player for the team and go anywhere they go , " said @entity206 , a native of @entity157 , who had only made the relatively short 11 - hour trip from @entity208			0
he did n't have to sell his own fridge either			0
" we will definitely win it , @entity43 will go down , " he said of sunday 's final , where once again there will thousands of @entity16 fans in the stands			1
" we want to win big and win over the champions of @entity132			0

the @entity40 is currently taking place in @entity1
@entity32 side @entity16 will play @entity44 's @entity43 in sunday 's final
@entity40 's six *confederation* champions fight it out
@entity16 have *bought* with them tens of thousands of fans
