the winger , who suffered the blow during the 2 - 0 @entity59 win over fierce rival @entity60 on saturday , is also a huge doubt for the @entity62			1

@entity93 , who has scored 14 goals this season , limped out of the action following a poor tackle from @entity112			1
" for a correct valuation of the extent of the damage and the outlook , a visit to a specialist will take place in the next few days , " @entity103 said in a statement			0
on the pitch , @entity121 inspired @entity123 to a 3 - 0 win over @entity125 in @entity126 with his 100th goal for the club in all competitions			1
he added a second after the break and 18 - year - old @entity132 netted a third on his full debut			0
@entity123 manager , @entity134 , who confirmed on christmas day that he will be leaving at the end of the season , told reporters he was delighted with @entity121 's performance			0
@entity123 " @entity121 played excellent football working for the team and scoring twice , " @entity134 said			0
