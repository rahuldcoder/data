-- @entity1 showed he will be a force to be reckoned with at new team @entity3 by dominating practice for the season - opening @entity6 event in @entity7 on friday , but seven - time world champion @entity8 struggled as he seeks to replace the @entity9 at @entity10			1
@entity3 claimed the three quickest times in the evening session at the @entity13 , with @entity1 's best of one minute 55:035 seconds heading off @entity15 @entity14 and @entity17 @entity16			1
@entity19 's world champion @entity18 was fourth fastest as he beat young @entity21 teammate @entity20 for the first time in three sessions this week			1
@entity25 motorcyclist @entity24 , who finished 12th overall last season , was the best of @entity10 's three riders in sixth place			2
@entity8 , who ended a seven - year stint with @entity19 at the end of a 2010 season marred by injuries , was eighth			2
@entity21 @entity35 , who also rode with @entity8 at @entity3 earlier in his career , was back in 14th			2
" today was a bit difficult , because we had hoped to make a bigger improvement , but in the end we did n't lower our time enough , " @entity8 told the @entity10 website			1
" first of all , my shoulder bothered me a little			0
i was n't as strong as i was yesterday , and in the end of the session , i could feel it			0
also , we still do n't know this bike perfectly and , as happened to us in the test , we get to a point where it 's difficult to make a step forward with the set - up			0
" we 're missing half a second with our pace to be in the group where we hope to be sunday			0
anyway , today we tried two set - up solutions that were quite different , and we chose one that we 'll try to refine tomorrow			0
" @entity1 , the 2007 world champion in motorcycling 's elite class , also set the fastest time in windy conditions in friday 's opening session of 1:55:457 as he again headed off @entity14 , with @entity20 third			1
@entity18 was fifth despite the @entity15 suffering problems with his bike which limited his time on the track			0
@entity8 was ninth , with @entity35 just behind him			0
@entity18 's compatriot @entity67 has been ruled out of sunday 's race after the 26 - year - old @entity70 rider suffered a broken leg when he crashed late in friday 's second session			1
qualifying will be held on saturday evening @entity7 time , with sunday 's race also at night at 1900 @entity75			2
