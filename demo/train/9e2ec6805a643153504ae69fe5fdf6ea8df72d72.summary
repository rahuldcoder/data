-- two years after the @entity1 pulled its forces out of @entity3 , the country is , in the words of one analyst , " a house of cards			1
" " it is a contraption held together solely by the reluctance of its many components to let things again come to blows , and which survives on constant infusions of cash thanks to high international oil prices , " wrote @entity9 analyst @entity8			2
yet the blows keep coming			0
in some parts of the country , violence has reached urgent proportions , with nearly 1,000 people killed in october alone , according to the @entity26			2
with prime minister @entity28 in @entity29 to plead for help from the @entity1 in battling a resurgent @entity31 , here 's a look at some of the main issues facing the country			1
sectarian divisions at the heart of so many of @entity3 's many problems is the deep - seated division between the country 's @entity40 majority and its @entity43 minority			1
those divisions have deep roots , including decades of repressive and often violent policies against @entity47 -- particularly @entity49 sunnis -- under the decades - long rule of dictator @entity51 , deposed in the 2003 @entity1 invasion of @entity3			1
a @entity43 , @entity53 , is @entity3 's president			1
however , many members of the faith feel marginalized by the more powerful @entity28 and what the @entity9 described in august as his " divide - and - conquer strategy that has neutered any credible @entity43 @entity60 leadership			0
" despite a power - sharing agreement reached in 2010 , @entity47 -- who enjoyed political dominance under @entity51 -- have complained that @entity28 has used " de-baathification " as a pretext to exclude them any significant role in national government			0
in 2010 , many @entity47 boycotted parliamentary elections after a government commission banned nearly 500 candidates for alleged links to the @entity43 - dominated @entity71 once led by @entity51			0
the violence playing out today has immediate roots in a 2012 @entity43 protest movement that analysts say began peacefully but escalated into violence after the government responded with force first			2
only later did the government offer what the @entity9 described as " half - hearted , belated concessions " that did more to disillusion @entity47 than placate them			0
circumstances are likely to continue to worsen , warned the @entity9			0
" under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution , many @entity47 have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms , " according to the group			2
5 lessons of the @entity3 war a resurgent @entity31 in 2008 , after an increase in @entity1 forces in @entity3 and with the aid of @entity43 tribes who joined the battle against insurgents , @entity31 in @entity3 appeared to be badly beaten			2
but since the 2011 withdrawal of @entity1 troops , the @entity43 - led group known as the @entity103 has staged a comeback amid @entity3 's growing sectarian tensions -- as well as the conflict in neighboring @entity109			1
some , including @entity111 @entity110 sens. @entity110 and @entity112 , have criticized @entity28 's governing approach for antagonizing @entity47			0
in a letter to @entity116 ahead of his visit with @entity28 , the two complained that the prime minister is part of the problem standing between @entity3 and greater stability			1
" by too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda , prime minister @entity28 and his allies are disenfranchising @entity126 , marginalizing @entity127 , and alienating the many @entity128 who have a democratic , inclusive , and pluralistic vision for their country , " they wrote			1
" many analysts say heavy - handed actions taken by the @entity28 government to consolidate power in the wake of the @entity1 withdrawal have alienated much of the @entity43 minority and provided @entity103 with potent propaganda , " @entity133 and @entity134 of the @entity135 wrote this week			0
and the @entity9 argued in august that " under intensifying pressure from government forces and with dwindling faith in a political solution , many @entity47 have concluded their only realistic option is a violent conflict increasingly framed in confessional terms			0
" that the conflict is increasingly violent is without question			0
more than 6,400 civilians have died in violence in @entity3 this year , the @entity26 reports , 979 in october alone			1
and @entity31 linked attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated and brazen			0
for instance , this week , attackers hit a military checkpoint west of @entity159 with a suicide car bombing			0
gunmen then targeted ambulances carrying victims , police said			0
in another example , fighters from the group carried out sophisticated , multipronged attacks on two prisons near @entity170 in july , setting hundreds of prisoners free , including high - ranking @entity31 members , according to authorities			0
the situation has grown dire enough to raise the specter of a renewed civil war there , according to many analysts and even the special representative of the @entity26 secretary - general in @entity3 , @entity180			2
" today , @entity3 is riven by constant and worsening violence , and the prospect of deepening sectarianism casts a dark shadow over the country			1
these challenges -- both developmental and security -- threaten the very fabric of @entity3 society and test the extent of the nation 's social cohesion , " he said in a speech last week in @entity170			1
the history of @entity3 @entity109 the situation next door in @entity109 , where civil war is raging , is n't helping @entity3 's stability			1
not only are @entity49 officials having to find ways to deal with nearly 200,000 refugees who have sought shelter in relatively peaceful northern @entity3 , the conflict is increasing militancy in the region			1
" the war in @entity109 has become a magnet that attracts sectarian extremists and terrorists from various parts of the world and gathers them in our neighborhood , with many slipping across our all - too - porous borders , " @entity28 wrote in a @entity208 opinion piece this week			0
although @entity3 is technically neutral on @entity109 's civil war , @entity28 is widely seen as supportive of the county 's president , @entity219 , for fear of what could happen should @entity43 extremists linked to @entity31 take control there			1
" the civil war in neighboring @entity109 has exacerbated domestic tensions , " the @entity225 , a human rights group , recently wrote			0
" @entity229 and @entity128 radicals have joined armed groups fighting in @entity109 , while prime minister @entity28 is seen by some @entity128 as being overly sympathetic to president @entity219 's government and its @entity234 allies			1
" security issues given such issues to deal with , it 's no wonder @entity28 is calling on @entity116 to seek more assistance to help combat terrorism and other security concerns			1
among other things , he 's seeking military equipment and other aid to help bolster border security , combat terrorism and tackle other threats			0
the @entity1 plans to go ahead with delivery of @entity248 fighter jets to @entity3 next year , and a senior @entity1 official who spoke to reporters on background said this week that in addition to weapons sales , greater intelligence - sharing is also likely in the cards			2
" what we do n't want the @entity128 to do is just take a security - centric approach to this , " the official said			0
" what that means is making sure they have information in terms of where people are located , where it 's coming from , where the funding is coming from , and that 's something we can do pretty effectively , " the official continued			2
" so we 're trying to help them now as best we can , and that 's going to be a key topic of discussion over the course of the visit			2
" economic issues although gains have been made to restore @entity3 's economy after years of war , occupation and violence , crushing poverty remains pervasive , and the economy remains fragile			1
nearly 2 million @entity128 sometimes lack enough to eat , @entity180 said			0
infant mortality remains high , as does illiteracy and unemployment			0
and the violence threatens to derail the country 's oil production , which drives much of its economy			1
according to @entity3 's @entity293 , exports fell to 62.1 million barrels in september , from a peak of 79 million barrels in april , when the worst of the violence began			1
a continued slide could threaten the government 's ability to pay for increased security and economic development efforts			1
the oil sector provides more than 90 % of government revenue and four - fifths of its foreign exchange earnings , according to the @entity308			0
spurt of attacks in @entity3			2

sectarian divisions , terror , regional conflict and economic issues all threaten @entity3 stability
continued violence could also threaten the country 's oil exports and economy
all these issues form backdrop for @entity3 prime minister 's visit with president @entity116
