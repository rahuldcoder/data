-- several women who publicly supported a campaign to defy @entity4 's de facto ban on women driving fear they are being followed and investigated by the country 's secret police			1
the women , who requested anonymity due to their concerns for their safety , described to @entity0 monday how they 'd been " followed by cars filled with men since saturday , " when dozens of women across the kingdom participated in the october 26 women 's @entity17			1
at least five women said vehicles had been parked outside their houses since saturday			1
" i do n't know for sure if it is secret police or just men trying to harass us because we want the right to drive , but they are trying to intimidate us , " said one woman			1
" i 'm positive i 'm being followed by the secret police since saturday , " said another , who added she 'd gotten no official word she was being investigated			1
over the weekend , in an extraordinary act of civil disobedience , at least 41 women got behind the wheel and drove on the streets of various @entity4 cities			2
many filmed themselves and uploaded those videos to @entity39			0
now , several of them say the euphoria of that moment has quickly turned to worry over what might happen to them next			0
many wonder if they 'll be punished for hitting the open road in such a closed society			0
while no formal law exists in @entity4 specifically barring women from driving , religious edicts are often interpreted there to mean it is illegal for females to do so			1
other @entity4 women have been penalized in the past for defying the ban			2
in 1990 , a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through the streets of @entity61 , the country 's capital			1
after being arrested , many lost their jobs and were placed under a travel ban			0
in 2011 , women 's rights activist @entity66 spent nine days in jail for posting online a video of herself driving			1
adding to their fears , the women say , is the detention of a man who worked closely with the campaign			2
they say @entity74 , a columnist and teacher , was called in for questioning by the @entity76 in @entity61 on sunday and has not been released yet			0
@entity4 's @entity77 would neither confirm nor deny if @entity74 was being held			0
reached via text message , maj. gen. @entity79 , the @entity77 's spokesman , responded to @entity0 , saying , " as far as i know , the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) does n't detain anybody , but they could call people for questioning or interrogation			2
" despite repeated attempts , @entity0 was unable to reach the @entity76 for comment and was told by @entity79 that the agency has no spokesperson			0
when asked if @entity4 women who participated in or supported the women 's driving campaign were being targeted , followed or investigated , @entity79 told @entity0 , " i do n't understand the reason to follow anybody			1
if we have anything against anyone we would act according to the laws			0
" one woman , whose worry is growing by the hour , said participants in the movement only wanted to " emphasize to the @entity4 government that this campaign is not a challenge to the @entity4 government			0
" she described the campaign , which has gained serious momentum since it was first announced in late september , as " just following up on @entity107 and other officials ' words in the past that the women 's driving issue is one for society to decide			1
" " we just want to be allowed to drive our own cars , " she said			0
@entity4 is still very much split over the question of women driving , with many women there supporting not just the driving ban , but also in favor of the conservative kingdom 's guardianship system , which mandates that @entity4 women can not go to school , get a job or even travel without permission from their male guardians			2
asked about the issue at a regular briefing monday , a spokeswoman for the @entity129 voiced support for @entity4 women 's " ability to drive			1
" " we support , of course , the right of women everywhere to make their own decisions about their lives and their futures , and the right to benefit equally from public services and protection from discrimination , " said @entity135 , the spokeswoman			0
" we support the full inclusion of women in @entity4 society			0
" she said that the @entity150 raises " human rights issues , equal rights issues , frequently with the @entity4 government			2
