editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist , is chairwoman of the @entity5 's @entity4 and founder of @entity7 , a political consulting firm			1
she was the campaign manager for the @entity11 - @entity10 ticket in 2000 and wrote " cooking with @entity12			2
" @entity2 says @entity14 's inauguration is a huge milestone in the fight for equal rights @entity18 ( @entity19 ) -- today @entity14 will be sworn in as the 44th @entity20			1
this is the day for which so many prayed , so many marched and so many more sacrificed			2
this is a day of jubilation and celebration			0
this is the day to rejoice and recommit ourselves to restoring the @entity29 dream for us all			0
@entity14 's election offers our country the opportunity to open a new chapter that will allow us to turn the corner on past prejudices and racial politics			1
when sen. @entity14 announced his candidacy for president in 2007 , most people , black and white , thought it would be , at best , an interesting sideshow			1
after @entity14 's victories in the early primaries , there came the controversial videos of the rev. @entity46 , broadcasting a racial divisiveness that cast even greater doubt on an @entity14 candidacy			1
but the senator moved quickly to reassure people that @entity46 's jaundiced view of @entity29 did not reflect his own			2
@entity29 wanted to move beyond racial categorization and the politics of division			0
and so did the voters			0
but @entity58 - @entity29 did n't believe it			1
seventy - one percent of black voters had never thought a black candidate for president would get elected in their lifetime , according to a national poll released in november by @entity65 yet 59 percent of white respondents said they had thought it was possible			1
@entity14 did not just win the caucuses in @entity69 -- a state with a white population of more than 94 percent -- he resoundingly captured it			1
other primary victories , once thought improbable , soon followed			0
these included @entity74 , and @entity75 , the former seat of the @entity77			0
on @entity78 , @entity14 won a higher percentage of the white vote than @entity81 did in 2004 , though he did not get a majority of whites			1
unlike other black presidential candidates before him , @entity14 did not run as " the black candidate			1
" he ran as a @entity3 candidate , a @entity29 senator from @entity88 , and a progressive			2
and @entity29 , by larger margins than in previous recent elections , voted for the progressive @entity3 @entity29 senator from @entity88 who happened to be biracial			0
for too long , race has been the stain on the @entity29 fabric			0
as secretary @entity96 reminded us , race has been our " nation 's birth defect			2
" at times during the long primary and general election , race became a subtle distraction -- but the @entity29 people rejected it and it was never the primary issue			0
nor was it the primary issue for @entity29 who voted for @entity14			1
the vast majority of those who voted for and against @entity14 did so based on the content of his political prescriptions and platform -- not the color of his skin			1
a lot of lessons were taught november 4			0
@entity14 's election revealed the possibility of three new truths for african - americans : @entity120 may not be as racist as african - americans thought they were ; a solution to our country 's lingering racial problem may eventually be found ; and the rev. @entity127 's dream that one day all people will be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin is alive and within reach			1
@entity14 's election has inspired 6 in 10 blacks to forecast better race relations in the @entity29			1
" a majority of blacks now believe that a solution to the country 's racial problems will eventually be found , " said @entity19 polling director @entity135			2
" in every previous poll on this topic dating back to 1993 , black respondents had always said that racial problems were a permanent part of the @entity29 landscape			0
even in the most recent polls taken last week , a majority of african - americans said that a solution to the country 's racial problems could be within reach ; now blacks and whites agree that racial tensions may end			1
" yes , of course , racism still exists in @entity29			0
but if a black man can become @entity20 , then are n't all @entity29 now free to believe they can achieve any goal they set for themselves ? so on this day , let us all rejoice and be glad			2
let us celebrate this moment in @entity29 history and let us resolve to find common ground			0
let us resolve to join together as a nation to ensure that racial prejudice in @entity29 , as well as an ethic of non-achievement based on excuses and low expectations , dies the same death it did in the november ballot box			0
what our founders envisioned -- what president @entity175 and the rev. @entity127 fought and died for , we are perhaps finally ready to achieve			1
this is a remarkable moment			0
though not the apex we need to reach , it is still a mountaintop , alive with possibilities , a dream no longer deferred			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity14 's inauguration is a time for rejoicing and rededication
@entity2 : hardly anyone took @entity14 seriously as a candidate two years *ago*
@entity2 : he did n't run as an african - american candidate but as a @entity194
@entity2 : we are perhaps ready to achieve what @entity175 and the rev. @entity127 fought for
