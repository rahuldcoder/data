@entity0 -- @entity2 got @entity3 - boated			0
@entity4 had his re-election chances decimated in the @entity7 desert			2
then there was @entity9 and that tank photo			0
it is a tradition of presidential politics in recent decades that @entity13 get accused of being soft and inexperienced on military and foreign policy issues , and @entity16 was no different in 2008			1
however , a string of foreign policy successes -- including the killings of terrorist leaders @entity21 and @entity22 , and now the toppling of the @entity25 regime in @entity26 without the loss of any @entity29 service members -- have made @entity16 seemingly invulnerable to the quadrennial @entity31 attack line			1
the question is whether it will matter a year from now , when voters decide if he should get a second term			0
to analysts interviewed monday , the president 's policies and actions during almost three years in power have helped him shed the knee - jerk , anti-war reputation affixed to @entity13 since the @entity44 era			1
they cite increased drone strikes in @entity47 and @entity48 , including the one that killed the @entity29 - born @entity22 , as well as the @entity52 mission that raided a compound in @entity47 housing @entity21			0
" those actions demonstrate a degree of toughness that insulates him from the charge of being soft on defense , " said @entity55 , vice president and director of governance studies at the @entity57 think tank in @entity0			0
however , voter dissatisfaction with 9 % unemployment and crawling economic recovery is likely to overwhelm any benefit the president gets from foreign policy successes , said @entity70 , a @entity1 senior political analyst			1
according to @entity70 , the association of @entity13 with liberal pacifism dates back decades			0
in the middle of the 20th century , he noted , @entity13 were the party of international engagement willing to " bear any burden " to defend the nation and its interests , as president @entity79 put it at his 1961 inaugural address			0
then the @entity44 deeply divided the country , with @entity13 becoming inextricably linked to the fervent anti-war movement by nominating liberal @entity84 sen. @entity83 for president in 1972 , according to @entity70			1
in subsequent decades , the perception persisted of @entity13 as liberals who were soft on communism and unwilling to use military force			0
in 1980 , the failure of a military mission in @entity7 ordered by @entity4 to rescue 52 @entity29 held hostage since the revolution the previous year cemented his image as a weak leader			2
crashed helicopters in the desert became the foreign policy symbol of a presidency that helped orchestrate the @entity101 between @entity102 and @entity103			1
@entity4 then was defeated by @entity104 in the presidential election that year			2
@entity9 saw his campaign against then - vice president @entity107 undermined in part by a photo that sought to prop up his military credentials by showing him riding a tank			2
however , the image of @entity9 in what appeared to be an over-large military helmet with his name affixed to the front , his tie and business shirt visible beneath military outer garb , instead prompted ridicule			0
the " soft on war " legacy for @entity13 continued in 2004 , when @entity2 came under fierce , privately funded attacks that accused him of falsifying his account of a battle that earned him a @entity128 as a swift boat operator , as well as making false claims about misconduct by other @entity29 forces in @entity44 and @entity133			2
the campaign against @entity2 coined the phrase " swift - boating " in reference to an acute , partisan and not necessarily truthful political attack			0
it also turned what should have been a benefit for @entity2 -- his war record compared to the non-service in @entity44 by @entity31 incumbent @entity144 -- into a controversial issue			2
for @entity16 , what was perhaps his greatest foreign policy triumph -- the covert mission to send @entity29 special forces into @entity47 after @entity21 -- came close to the kind of failure that plagued @entity4 's rescue mission 31 years earlier			1
one of the @entity29 helicopters involved became disabled , forcing a change in how the mission was carried out			0
this time , though , the @entity29 forces were able to infiltrate @entity21 's compound , kill him and fly out with his body			0
former defense secretary @entity160 , who served in both @entity31 and @entity13 administrations , called @entity16 's decision to launch the mission one of the most courageous he ever saw a president make			1
if the @entity21 mission had failed , @entity55 and @entity70 noted , @entity16 would likely find himself in the same position as @entity4 -- an incumbent candidate labeled as weak and ineffective			1
" they would have tried to turn @entity16 into @entity4 , " @entity55 said , adding : " people would have said that even though the mission was ambitious , the execution was flawed and that this would reflect poorly on presidential leadership			1
" instead , " i do n't think it 's going to be possible for republicans to swift - boat @entity16 , " @entity55 said			1
the president 's actions " demonstrate a degree of toughness that @entity4 did n't have			1
" both @entity70 and @entity55 said @entity16 's strategy seeks to exert @entity29 influence while minimizing the nation 's long - term commitment to overseas conflict and any loss of @entity29 lives			1
that strategy was most evident in the @entity26 campaign , which was launched by the @entity29 under a @entity190 resolution authorizing establishment of a no - fly zone to protect civilians from attack by @entity25 's military			0
eventually , the campaign shifted to @entity198 control , with @entity29 forces playing a supporting role for air strikes that targeted @entity25 forces			0
in the end , the total cost to the @entity29 government is expected to be under $ 2 billion with no loss of @entity29 lives , compared to the more than $ 800 billion in costs and more than 4,000 @entity29 fatalities in the @entity209 launched by the @entity107 administration			0
some @entity31 have tried to defuse credit for @entity16 's policy , complaining it lasted longer than necessary because the administration withheld the full might and leadership of @entity29 forces throughout the @entity26 campaign			1
but to @entity217 , the successful completion of the mission -- with @entity25 gone and no long - term @entity29 commitment or cost -- will bolster @entity16 in next year 's election			1
" i 've seen that a lot of people are arguing foreign policy is not going to be relevant in 2012 , " according to @entity55			1
" i think those interpretations miss the leadership @entity16 has displayed in foreign affairs			2
" @entity70 warned that @entity16 remains vulnerable to problems in @entity231 and @entity232 , where the president is ending or reducing long - running @entity29 wars			1
last week , @entity16 announced that virtually all @entity29 troops would leave @entity231 by the end of the year , which would fulfill a campaign pledge from 2008			2
at the same time , the number of @entity29 troops in @entity232 is being decreased following an earlier surge ordered by @entity16 , with the goal of ending the war by the end of 2014			0
republicans such as veteran sen. @entity245 of @entity246 -- who lost to @entity16 in 2008 -- have criticized both moves , saying they undermined the long - running missions by providing @entity29 enemies with an end date to the nation 's military commitments in those countries			2
" i do think he 's fortified himself against these @entity31 attacks , " @entity70 said of @entity16 , but he added that " @entity231 or @entity232 or both could become a crisis between now and the election			0
overall , though , the president has strengthened his standing as commander - in - chief , @entity70 and research assistant @entity262 wrote in a @entity1 column last week			0
@entity16 's foreign policy approach will " bolster a campaign argument that may resonate not only with his base , but also with swing voters increasingly wary of foreign engagements : that @entity16 wields force much more prudently and surgically than the reckless @entity31 -- that he has wound down @entity231 and helped win back international respect , all while delivering strong results , " the column said .			1

foreign policy wins fortify the president against @entity44 - era criticism of *democrats*
analyst : president @entity16 is tougher than @entity4 was
*domestic* woes may trump foreign policy successes , however
