-- early this year , a crime spree hit the usually quiet residential neighborhood of @entity3 , northeast of downtown @entity4 , @entity5			2
over a period of three months , there were 25 home burglaries in the neighborhood , often carried out while residents were out for just a few hours			2
when police work failed to produce any arrests , the community took to the @entity14 to do some sleuthing on its own			2
they crowdsourced details of the crimes on @entity19 , a private social network for urban neighborhoods , and began noticing patterns			0
the burglars would wait to see a homeowner leave and then enter the house and stuff a pillowcase with high - value items like jewelry , guns and cameras before slinking out			0
sometimes , they 'd hit as many as three houses in a day			0
the residents started a virtual neighborhood watch using @entity34 , sending out detailed alerts about any suspicious cars or people and essentially live - blogging strangers ' movements throughout the 1 square - mile area			1
led by @entity3 neighborhood association president @entity42 , the community eventually gathered enough information and attention to push the local police department into action , resulting in an undercover sweep of the area and multiple drug busts			1
though no arrests have yet been specifically tied to the break - ins , the rate of burglaries fitting that pattern in @entity3 has plummeted			0
" before , they did n't have these tools			0
it was people chit - chatting in their front yards , " @entity42 said			0
" i think it has shown the police department that we are an active neighborhood and that we are very concerned about crime			2
" i think it has also shown them that we will stand up for our neighborhood , and by @entity70 , you better pay attention to us			0
" a sheriff in your pocket neighborhood watch groups have been around for decades			1
they are meant to empower residents to report suspicious activities to police without acting on them directly			0
now , thanks to mobile devices and social media , today 's homeowners are using a new arsenal of digital tools to fight crime , coordinate in an emergency and revitalize the neighborhood watch			1
the @entity89 is working on an app that will help neighborhood watch members share real - time video surveillance footage shot on a smartphone with law enforcement and with each other			1
the hope is that the program will shorten response times between when civilians believe they 've witnessed something suspicious and when police respond			0
" after the @entity105 case in @entity106 , we started looking at our program , " said chief @entity102 , deputy executive director of the @entity89			2
@entity105 , 17 , was shot and killed in february 2012 by @entity108 , a neighborhood watch coordinator in his gated community of @entity110 , near @entity111			1
@entity108 was not on duty at the time , and his actions were quickly disavowed by neighborhood watch associations , which frown upon vigilante violence			1
" we do n't want people to get involved , and this app would pretty much stop that			0
you would n't have to get out of your car			0
you would n't have to leave your house , " @entity102 said			0
if a neighborhood watch member spots a crime in progress or suspicious activity , they can take out their smartphone , open the free @entity132 / @entity131 app and hit the emergency button to record photos , video , audio and the precise gps location of their phone			1
the information is automatically uploaded every few seconds to a secure cloud server , where it can not be deleted			0
the mapped alert with the video can be sent directly to the local police , other neighbors in the group and even a custom list of personal emergency contacts			1
it can also dial 911			0
the new initiative , called @entity150 now , is a collaboration between the @entity89 and a company called @entity153 , which developed the app. the tool has been in development for 2Â½ years and is rolling out this month in a handful of pilot neighborhoods , starting with two counties in @entity5 and @entity160			1
local members and law enforcement agencies will need to be trained on the technology			0
" it 's going to be the future of neighborhood watch , " said @entity102			1
going @entity34 although the @entity150 now app is designed to be used during emergencies , much of what happens daily in a neighborhood is far from 911 - worthy : a stolen bike , broken car windows , loud parties and so on			1
for the past year , the @entity174 has used the @entity34 app to field local concerns and improve communication with residents			1
members also use @entity34 to coordinate social events , announce garage sales , find contractors and track down missing pets			1
they say it makes them feel more connected to their neighbors			0
residents of @entity189 , a suburb of @entity190 , @entity191 , use @entity34 to coordinate block parties and revive the quaint ideal of a neighborhood where people know each other 's names and look out for one another			1
during a recent rash of garage robberies , members used @entity34 to remind people to lock their garage doors			2
to start a @entity34 community , one person fills out an application and must sign up at least 10 neighbors in 21 days to make it official			1
more than 33,000 neighborhoods across the country now use the network			0
in @entity213 , each @entity34 network is assigned a community relations officer who can use the platform to field questions , post crime updates and safety tips , and chat with members			2
" it gives everyone a chance to actually get to know the officers that are working for them , " said @entity220 , a @entity213 police officer who oversees much of the department 's social media			1
he said the officers like @entity34 as a way to address minor complaints , such as telling residents whom to call to remove graffiti			1
@entity220 also would like to see the app become even more hyperfocused , say on an apartment building with as few as 15 units			0
a single building could have its own network , and property managers could be trained on how to use the app to reduce crime			0
police also receive tips through the @entity34 app. recently , a resident in @entity213 's northwest division spotted a @entity248 pickup that had been parked facing the wrong way for a number of days			1
they reported the car on @entity34 , and when an officer went to check it out , they discovered that the vehicle was stolen and had been used in several burglaries in the area			2
" we do n't want ( @entity34 ) to become a way of reporting crimes , " said @entity220			2
" we still want people to call the police			0
" finally , @entity34 could become another way for police and fire departments to quickly broadcast warnings , @entity266 and evacuation instructions			1
it 's been used during @entity191 wildfires and the polar vortex that froze much of the @entity271 over the winter			0
" i believe that the best information comes from the authorities , but a lot of times , the authorities do n't have a way to reach people , " said @entity34 ceo @entity273 .			2
