-- why would former @entity4 @entity3 allegedly " orchestrate the execution " of @entity2 , leaving him shot seven times and his body near a construction pile in an industrial park ? the motive was something trivial , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
investigators believe @entity3 ' s simmering anger over two incidents at a nightclub and his apartment led him to allegedly kill @entity2 two nights later , @entity0 has learned			1
@entity3 " drove the victim to the remote spot , and then he orchestrated his execution , " assistant district attorney @entity21 said last year			2
one of the incidents involved @entity2 seeing guns and ammunition stored at @entity3 ' so - called flop house , his apartment in @entity29 , @entity30			1
the other thing that set off @entity3 was a conversation @entity2 had with two men at a club earlier that night , june 14 , 2013 , a source tells @entity0			1
the cumulative effect apparently reached a breaking point for reasons that most people would find inconsequential			0
the source would not say what that was , but compared it to something as insignificant as a spilled drink that allegedly led to the 2012 @entity46 double murder of @entity47 and @entity48 , a separate case in which @entity3 also has pleaded not guilty			1
@entity2 's killing did not involve possible knowledge of that double murder as investigators previously considered , the source added			1
who was @entity2 ? @entity3 's anger was fueled by paranoia brought on , in part , by his alleged drug use including angel dust and marijuana , the source said			1
the motive was hinted at in court this week , when new details emerged about the events at @entity67 nightclub where @entity3 and some friends partied before moving to @entity3 ' apartment about 10 miles from his home			1
@entity2 , a semi-pro football player and @entity3 were dating sisters			1
prosecutors say @entity3 appeared upset at the club			2
they describe him appearing agitated on security video			0
witnesses describe him with his arms waving in the air and a parking valet saw the football player put a gun in his waistband when he got into his vehicle , according to authorities			0
" an incident had occurred that caused him to arm himself , " @entity21 told a judge			0
@entity3 ' s lawyer told a judge that his client 's friends said the incident at the club was not a problem			1
when @entity3 and @entity2 left , they went to the tight end 's apartment accompanied by two women to party , prosecutors say			1
whatever happened involving the guns and bullets at the apartment and earlier at the nightclub , @entity2 did n't think it was a big deal , according to friends who saw him the following two days leading up to his death			1
they said he only talked about having a good time with @entity3			2
" there 's certainly a lot of what i would call smoke , " defense attorney @entity109 said in court			0
" there 's no doubt about it ... but that 's not probable cause that he committed murder			0
and you ca n't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that 's good enough			0
" the fallen @entity4 's alleged behavior , as described by investigators , appears to follow a bizarre pattern that has resulted in three murder charges , and a lawsuit accusing him of shooting a friend in the face and leaving him for dead			0
in each case , authorities say , the violence was preceded by something perceived as disrespect or betrayal			0
in july 2012 , @entity3 is charged with fatally shooting two men in a car after one of them , a stranger , bumped into @entity3 on the dance floor at a night club , causing the athlete to spill his drink , according to @entity46 's district attorney			2
@entity3 felt he was being " tested , " a friend is quoted as telling investigators , prompting @entity3 to follow the men out of the club and kill them in a drive by shooting			0
that same friend identified in court papers as @entity156 is now suing @entity3 for allegedly shooting him in the face and leaving him for dead in an industrial park in south @entity159 in february 2013			0
prosecutors say @entity3 felt ' disrespected ' by @entity156 because he challenged him after the football player refused to return to a strip club to retrieve @entity156 's cellphone			2
in court , prosecutor @entity21 said according to @entity156 , trust was a big deal to @entity3			0
" the more he got to know you ... the more suspicious he was , " @entity21 told the judge			0
" he was concerned ( about ) the things that you knew about him ... @entity2 knew such things about the defendant			0
" four months later , in june , 2013 , @entity2 was picked up in a car said to be driven by @entity3 with two of his associates , taken to an industrial park , shot and killed , according to prosecutors			1
those associates , @entity179 and @entity180 , are also charged with first - degree murder and like @entity3 , have pleaded not guilty			0
his lawyers this week filed a motion asking a court to authorize a subpoena demanding @entity3 's work and medical records from the @entity4 , including records that " may bear upon ( @entity3 ' ) mental state at the time ... of @entity2 's murder			1
" legal experts say the motion indicates the defense may be leaning toward arguing @entity3 suffers from diminished capacity , a legal term for someone who is less responsible for committing a crime because it 's harder for them to know the difference between right and wrong			2
prosecutors seeking tattoo artists who inked @entity3 prosecutors : @entity3 discussed killing in jailhouse calls patriots added to wrongful death suit against @entity3 @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report			2
