-- like many aspiring singers on @entity3 , 17 - year - old @entity1 has uploaded several videos of herself belting out covers and original songs			1
but her most popular @entity3 video , which was later posted on @entity8 , was shot just after doctors sliced a hole in her neck			1
a golf - ball - sized tumor -- what turned out to be an extremely rare cancer -- was causing her to have difficulty breathing , and she needed an emergency tracheotomy			2
even after the tracheotomy , she could still sing			2
" music has been my passion ever since i was young , " the @entity19 resident wrote on her blog			2
" i started taking guitar lessons when i was 11 years old , and i 've been singing for as long as i can remember			2
" @entity1 hopes that , despite the tumor , she 'll still be able to pursue singing as a career			1
the diagnosis music was n't always the primary focus of @entity1 's life			1
she initially hoped to become a competitive figure skater , training six days a week for more than five years			2
the intense training was something she learned from her mother , who was an @entity35 marathon runner in 1996			2
it was through skating that @entity1 first suspected something might be wrong			1
" her skating coach noticed that just walking up a flight of stairs , she 'd breathe hard , " said her mother , @entity37			2
it seemed unusual that such a young athlete might have trouble breathing			2
@entity1 and her family went for a year believing -- as doctors told them -- that she had asthma			1
but a ct scan in february revealed a clear cell sarcoma outside the trachea			2
@entity1 knew her skating career would be put on hold			1
teen with cancer blogs her bucket list a rediscovered passion without skating to fill her time , @entity1 turned her efforts to singing			1
she has uploaded seven videos to @entity3 in the past year , where she has nearly 50,000 views			1
" everything happens for a reason , " she said of her condition			0
" it was an easy switch to put music as the biggest thing in my life right now ... and my music has taken off , which is nice			0
" in april , her videos received the notice of actress and pop star @entity71			1
@entity73 tweeted , " @entity1 you are so strong girl			1
love you ! and praying for you			0
" the words echo many of the comments on @entity1 's @entity3 and @entity80 pages -- and helped her singing videos take off online			1
she has certainly followed @entity73 's advice , too			0
singing is " therapeutic for her in a way , " said her mother			2
may @entity1 believes this is the best way her daughter has found to deal with the fact that she has a hole in her trachea and her hair has been shaved down , and it 's how she has chosen to express herself			1
her daughter put it this way : " before february 4 , my biggest problem was trying to find a prom dress			0
" may @entity1 added , " she wants to make something of ( her condition ) instead of moping around			1
" @entity1 's focus on singing is n't unusual for a patient , said dr. @entity102 of the @entity103 in @entity104			1
he has seen others with cancer turn to creative outlets			0
" any kind of devastating medical situation will make people more introspective , " he explained			0
" artists ' careers have sometimes evolved having gone through cancer			0
i 've seen patients find that creativity to express themselves whether in music or in art. we 've seen that for millennia			0
it changes the tenor of their art and productivity			0
" what the future holds will @entity1 still be able to belt out her songs in the same way when her cancer is eventually surgically removed ? luckily , " her vocal cords are not involved with the tumor , " according to her mother			1
teen beating the odds after brain injury however , she added , " the one side that the tumor 's on , the vocal cord nerve may be affected by the tumor			2
it 's very difficult to tell on the ct scan			0
we 're hoping the chemotherapy will help the situation			0
" @entity1 herself maintains a positive attitude			1
" there is a smaller chance there may be some permanent damage , but i try not to think about that , " she said			0
early on , there were some fears as well			0
@entity1 admitted that she was originally scared by her diagnosis after searching online			1
she has since mostly stayed away from searching for information on her illness			0
when the family learned about the tumor , @entity37 said she and her husband got choked up			2
" ( @entity1 ) turned to us in a calm voice and said she was glad it was her and not anyone else in the family , because she knew she could handle it			1
" despite being told there was a 5 % chance that chemotherapy would affect a tumor in the trachea , the tumor has become softer since treatment and has moved away from the thyroid gland , which makes it easier to remove surgically			1
no matter what happens , @entity1 still plans to pursue her passions			1
she 's still thinking about a possible singing career , despite the fact that she had to cancel an audition for @entity182 's @entity181 a few days after she was diagnosed			1
she looks forward to getting back on the ice one day as well			1
it 's that unstoppable attitude that has been the most inspirational to witness , her mother said			0
" from an early age , @entity1 always knew what she wanted and had no fear trying to get it , " she said			1
" for her , every day presents a new opportunity to take a step closer			2
the interesting thing about @entity1 is that she actually enjoys the journey as much as achieving her goals			1
when things do n't go according to plan , she rallies quickly and moves on			0
she has the ability to make anything fun and finds it very difficult to sit still			0
" " she 's been able to touch people , " @entity37 added			0
" her public school raised $ 5,000 in a fundraiser for ( @entity19 's ) @entity203 where she 's having her chemotherapy			0
there are thousands of dollars coming into @entity206 where she has the link on her blog			0
she 's very proud of that			0
" in the meantime , @entity1 continues to inspire people on social media with her positive attitude			1
" for me to be able to reach out to other people throughout all this has been great , " she said			0
