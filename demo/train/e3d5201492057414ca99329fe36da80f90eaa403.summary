-- as driving snow enveloped him and the temperature sank towards zero , @entity4 must have wondered if all that hard graft to realize his dream was worth it			1
but not even the extreme weather conditions that blighted the @entity10 cycle race could tarnish the pride the 22 - year - old felt at becoming a pioneer for his sport in @entity16			1
eight years previously , a wall of color and noise had transfixed him as @entity22 's biggest bike race snaked through the @entity24 township where he lived			1
it was the first time he 'd seen or heard of competitive cycling , and it started a journey that would end with him becoming the first black @entity16 to participate at the sport 's elite division , on the @entity34 's @entity33			1
and all the wind , rain , snow and ice thrown at him during @entity40 's famous 298 - kilometer race could n't wash away the elation @entity4 felt at etching his name in the history books forever			1
" i 've never been that cold in my whole life , " @entity4 told @entity0 's @entity46 series			1
" it was snowing , it was wet and the rain kept coming down			0
" i was riding with my eyes closed at some points because there was no visibility with sunglasses , but when you took them off the snow went into your eyes			0
" while the racing and weather was so hard i was thinking , ' why am i doing this , this is horrible			0
' but then i thought , ' this is what i 've dreamed about			0
i would not want to be anywhere else in the world			0
' " it was unbelievable but i told myself i 'm just going to keep on going			0
" tragedy took @entity4 from his home in @entity71 near the east coast of @entity16 to the @entity73 as a teenager , but it would prove to be the place his sporting dream crystallized			1
after losing both his mother and father in the space of two years he moved 1,200 km to @entity24 , the country 's largest township , to live with his aunt			2
soon after the sight of those 35,000 riders sweeping past his home had ignited in him a desire to discover cycling , he was introduced to the @entity89 project , which aims to help disadvantaged kids become champions on and off the bike			2
@entity4 was desperate to throw himself into competition right away			2
there was just one problem -- he had no idea how to cycle			0
" when i actually saw people riding , to me it was like ' why are these people riding bikes ? what 's going on here ? ' and then i actually joined them , " he explained			0
" but when i did it was weird because i did n't even know how to ride a bike because i never knew anything about bikes			2
" it is no surprise that despite the treacherous conditions in his first @entity33 race , @entity4 's dedication to the cause was absolute			1
after some promising junior results , and finishing third in the @entity115 in 2012 , he swapped his home in @entity16 for the @entity40 town of @entity118 , near @entity119 , in order to train harder and smarter			2
by the end of his @entity10 appearance the cold had taken such a grip on him that he had to be helped out of his cycling threads by the director of his @entity129 - @entity128 team , @entity16 's first pro-continental outfit			1
he was not able to finish the race , which was shortened due to the weather , but he had played his part in helping teammate @entity134 to claim victory			2
" it was just an unbelievable feeling , especially for me to be part of the team , " @entity4 said			1
his passion for the sport has helped in his battle to overcome the traumatic events that visited him at such a tender age			0
" for me to lose my parents at a young age , it was one the biggest challenges i 've had to face in my life , " he said			0
" to grow up without the support of a parent , it was very difficult , but then i actually got to know the sport of cycling , that 's when i decided , ' ok i just have to do this			1
' " no - one is able to ride the bike apart from you -- even if my parents were there they would n't ride the bike for me -- so at the end of the day it just depends what you want in life			1
" there 's no point feeling sorry for yourself and people are not going to feel sorry for you			0
i decided i just have to do what i have to do because i love the sport			0
" @entity4 's feats have not gone unnoticed back in @entity16 , and press interest in him has been extensive			1
it 'll go through the roof if he fulfills his ultimate ambition to make it to the @entity177			2
with his profile rising like his career , he hopes he can now prove an inspiration for other kids with similarly challenging lives in the townships of @entity16 and encourage a wave of interest in the sport			1
" there are very few black cyclists that are in the sport , " he said			2
" the first reason is this sport is really expensive			0
" in order to become a cyclist , it requires you to be dedicated and your family to be behind you because you have to buy bikes , helmets and shoes			0
" second of all , if i could go back to me , at the age of 13 you do n't even know what cycling is and you do n't even know there 's a sport that exists that 's called cycling			1
" at least now there are more people recognizing me so when i go back to @entity207 they ask me questions and i start to tell them everything			0
" it 's improving but there 's still a lot that needs to be done			0
it would be great for me to see a lot of black @entity16 in the sport			1

@entity4 is the first black @entity16 to compete in a @entity33 cycling event
the 22 - year - old took up sport aged *14* after his parents died but did n't know how to ride
as part of @entity129 - @entity128 team , @entity4 participated in last month 's @entity10 race
he wants to improve so that he can take part in the @entity177 in 2015
