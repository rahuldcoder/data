-- @entity1 is a 37 - year - old @entity2 who lived in @entity4 and @entity5 before moving to @entity6 nearly six years ago			1
he runs an advertising agency and also writes @entity8 , a lifestyle blog about the city			2
@entity1 : " not many places have as much energy as @entity6			1
" @entity0 : you 've traveled around a lot -- what makes @entity6 unique ? @entity1 : not many places have so much energy and so many things going on			1
it can be very nerve wracking and exhausting , but on the other hand it 's very exciting			1
@entity4 is one of those places , @entity22 too , but there are only a handful of cities in the world that have that kind of energy			2
@entity0 : you used to be a dj -- what 's your opinion of @entity6 's nightlife ? @entity34 : for some people the nightlife is the best in the world , but for me it 's very commercial and posh			1
you can sum it up in one sentence , which is a general thing about @entity6 : people here live " @entity45			1
" they just want to go out and spend money and pretend they 're rich and successful and live this dream			0
i recently had a conversation with the club editor of @entity6 and i asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy			1
she said that in the modern " new @entity54 " culture people would rather sell their mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they 're not rich anymore			0
@entity6 is dominated by posh parties , but it 's no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you 're always judged by the labels you wear , the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with			1
@entity0 : where do you like to go in the city ? @entity34 : @entity68 is a really beautiful old monastery			2
@entity69 demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared			0
there 's a pond below it that you can walk around , and all the @entity79 popes are buried in he cemetery			2
it 's a very nice place			0
another place is would be @entity83 ( @entity84 ) , where you can look out over @entity6			1
it 's pretty industrial looking but it has good views			0
i also enjoy the center of @entity6			1
i like hanging out on the roof bar of a hotel , having a drink , looking out over @entity93			0
it makes you feel like you 're away from the noise of the city			2
what makes @entity6 special to you ? let us know			1
@entity0 : what do @entity100 do at the weekend ? @entity34 : it depends on the time of year , but in the summer they take every opportunity to get out of the city			1
everyone has a little weekend house called a " dacha " and every friday night after work people leave the city			2
from 4pm in the afternoon to 10pm at night you have long traffic jams on all the roads out of the city			0
people will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on sunday and monday mornings it 's the same			0
some " dachas " are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one , or even two or three			0
people go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques , they drink and they do some gardening			0
they value this " dacha " life so much that they 're willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 Â½ days in the woods			0
@entity0 : so is @entity6 is deserted in the summertime ? @entity34 : @entity6 is very quiet in the summertime -- it 's my favorite time			1
you can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend			0
towards the end of june , @entity6 is really empty			2
you really notice it from the middle of july until september , when it 's school vacations			0
@entity0 : has @entity6 change a lot since you moved there ? @entity34 : yes -- you can see it renewing itself			1
i know how it went with @entity150 -- in 10 years you wo n't recognize @entity6 anymore			1
streets have changed so much in the last five years , in a good way and a bad way			0
a lot of cool - looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers , but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the @entity161 for example			0
there are lots of new museums popping up , art centers , alternative art , new shops and cafes			0
it 's so different to when i came here five years ago and to be honest , i never would have expected it			2
@entity0 : what do you miss about @entity6 when you 're away ? @entity34 : i miss the excitement			2
there 's something going on all the time			0
there 's so much choice in terms of theater , classical ballet , the nightlife , the galleries			0
you have that in @entity150 but it 's harder to find and not as exciting , and @entity4 has lost a lot of its flavor , glamour and energy at the moment			1
@entity0 : if @entity6 were a person , what would he or she be like ? @entity34 : an ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty ! she would probably seem pretty rude , but inside she 's a good person .			1
