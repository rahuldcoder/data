@entity0 , @entity1 -- the cause of @entity5 's disappearance remains a mystery , but it has put the spotlight on the wildly varying approach governments with a stake in the search have handled the sensitivities and the facts			1
the @entity14 government has been roundly criticized for weeks of muddled misinformation and its seemingly off - hand dealings with the distraught families of the passengers and crew of the missing airliner			1
@entity21 , which has more than 150 of its citizens aboard the @entity23 , has been unrelenting in its criticism of @entity14 's handling of the search and the lack of transparency in information , while @entity29 was accused of withholding what might have been critical information about the @entity5 's possible flight path because it said no one had asked whether it had any intelligence			1
out of the fray emerged @entity1 and its conservative prime minister @entity38 , a man known more for his pugilistic , take - no - prisoner style of politics , than his statesmanship and compassion			1
on neither count has the @entity46 premier , until now , impressed			0
spy claims @entity38 refused to apologize to the @entity49 president when the leaked @entity51 files revealed @entity1 had been spying on @entity52 and his inner circle , including his wife			1
he has also run a tough , some say brutal , campaign against asylum seekers and the people smugglers who bring them to @entity1 across treacherous waters from @entity49			1
@entity38 , who accuses asylum seekers of illegally attempting to enter @entity1 , is comfortable with the policy masterminded by his predecessor , of sending those who seek refuge in @entity1 to @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity67 -- neither considered by the @entity68 to be adequate to house them			1
recently , the government announced it would stop funding legal assistance for asylum seekers who arrived by boat and are sitting in detention centers awaiting the chance to argue their case			1
but when he rose to his feet on march 20 to tell the @entity46 @entity80 that new satellite images showed what might be aircraft debris in the @entity84 , some 1,550 miles ( 2,500 kilometers ) off the coast of @entity1 and that an @entity46 - led search party would be investigating , @entity38 made international headlines			1
statesmanship peaked out from behind the curtains			0
when days later no debris had been found , @entity38 deflected criticism that he had jumped the gun saying the search area was " about the most inaccessible spot that you would imagine on the face of the earth			2
" but if there is anything down there we will find it			0
we owe it to the families of those people to do no less			0
" poll support an informal poll in the @entity106 showed many thought the prime minister had acted properly in announcing news of the satellite images			0
his compassion was perceived as real rather than political opportunism			0
after announcing that there would be no time limit on the search effort and that his government would bear the cost of coordinating the international operation , an impassioned @entity38 declared : " if the mystery is solvable , we will solve it			2
" it was a personal commitment			0
his determination to deliver " closure " for the families of those on board the jetliner stands in stark contrast to the approach of his @entity14 counterpart			1
while @entity131 sanctioned sending a text message to families informing them that the aircraft had likely ended up in the southern @entity84 , @entity38 told the families of the six @entity46 passengers on the flight the country had " an ache in its heart and nothing we can say or do will take that ache away			2
" and as the @entity46 - led search mission entered its second week , @entity38 told grieving relatives what asylum seekers have never heard			1
'' i want them all to know ... that they will be in the arms of a decent country , '' he said			0
'' the government has decided to waive visa fees for any relatives wishing to come to @entity1			2
'' ' eloquent and diplomatic ' even @entity38 's most fervent enemies would , if pressed , concede that the @entity46 premier has been both eloquent and diplomatic in the expression of his sorrow and grief for those who do not know if their relatives are by some miracle , still alive and if they are not , what caused their deaths			1
but the same fervent enemies might also question whether @entity38 sees an upside to statesmanship and compassion			2
tragedies of the scale of @entity5 are rarely used for political gain without the real and imminent danger of significant political cost			2
but such tragedies can soften images , turn skeptical minds and give hope to those who 've not been recipients of an open heart			0
when on february 16 , a young @entity182 asylum seeker was killed in a riot at the @entity65 detention centre , the @entity46 immigration minister , @entity180 , claimed @entity185 had died after leaving the confines of the @entity46 - run center , placing himself where @entity1 could not protect him			2
" this was a very dangerous situation where people decided to protest in a very violent way and to take themselves outside the center and place themselves at great risk , " @entity180 told @entity46 media			0
soon afterwards , @entity180 faced the media to admit @entity185 had in fact died inside the center			0
" you do n't want a wimp running border protection , you want someone strong and decent			0
and @entity180 is both strong and decent , " @entity38 told parliament			2
different leader coming after years of hardline railing against the number of asylum seekers landing on to @entity1 's shores , with many perishing en route , the government 's attitude seemed hard , even callous			1
many @entity46 were shocked and held candlelit vigils around the country			0
if @entity46 see the beginnings , perhaps even evidence of a different leader with @entity38 's deep , heartfelt concern for the souls who boarded @entity5 in @entity216 on route to @entity218 , there 's little chance this will wipe the memory of a leader who has shown little mercy to asylum seekers -- some of them children -- languishing in @entity1 's version of @entity228			1
but @entity46 might be convinced their prime minister has the capacity to change			0
opinion : pilot : why @entity5 may never be found			0

search for @entity5 has revealed differing approaches by governments involved
while @entity14 leaders have been criticized , @entity1 's pm has won *praise*
@entity242 : in contrast with @entity38 's tough line on issues such as asylum seekers
@entity38 has *vowed* to help bring " closure " to families of those missing on @entity5
