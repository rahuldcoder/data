-- @entity1 presented at a just - concluded breast cancer symposium will help doctors understand how to use existing drugs better when certain drugs do n't work , and how chemotherapy may not be to blame for so - called " chemo brain			1
" breast cancer doctors and researchers from around the world gathered at the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , last week to learn about the latest developments in treating the disease			1
here are some of those latest developments : 1			0
' @entity18 ' starts before chemo it 's been known for a long time that when women undergo breast cancer treatment , they can have trouble remembering regular tasks and jobs			1
chemotherapy , or so - called " chemo brain , " has often been blamed			1
there 's still no good explanation for why this happens or how to treat it			0
doctors are concerned about this because patients ' concerns over " chemo brain " may result in a reluctance to accept life - saving therapy , said @entity38 , an associate professor emerita at the @entity39 in @entity40 , who presented a new study at @entity11			2
using an mri , her team tested patient 's brain function while performing a working memory task in the scanner			0
this was done before any chemotherapy started and a month after treatment was completed			2
the study involved a total of 97 participants : 28 patients receiving chemotherapy , 37 patients who got radiation therapy and 32 healthy women			2
breast cancer awareness : not so pretty pink the results showed that women who were scheduled to undergo chemotherapy had the lowest activation of the part of the brain that is critical for the effective performance of a working memory task : the left inferior frontal gyrus			1
women who were not able or less able to activate the frontal brain region suffered greater fatigue over time , regardless of treatment , @entity38 said			2
also , women expecting chemotherapy were more worried and more fatigued than the other groups , including the radiation group			0
@entity38 believes there 's a need for increased awareness that cognitive problems can begin before a woman starts chemotherapy after her tumor is removed , including letting women know that as they wait for chemotherapy to start , they are more vulnerable to cognitive problems related to worry and fatigue			0
she said " chemo brain " may not be an appropriate label for cancer - related cognitive dysfunction because there are likely other sources that contribute to the problem or produce problems that would n't exist otherwise			2
twice as long is better with the drug tamoxifen when breast cancer patients take the hormone - blocking drug tamoxifen for 10 years instead of five , they can significantly reduce their chances of the cancer coming back or of dying from it , according to new data from an ongoing clinical trial called @entity108 or @entity109 -- @entity110			1
about a decade ago , the @entity111 recommended premenopausal women with a type of cancer that is fueled by estrogen ( called estrogen - positive breast cancer ) should only take tamoxifen for five years after they 've had tumors surgically removed			1
the argument was that there was n't sufficient data to justify it taking longer , according to dr. @entity125 , director of the breast cancer program at the @entity127 at @entity12			1
while tamoxifen has been known to have a residual effect of another five years after a patient stops taking it , " about one - third of relapse in estrogen - positive patients occur after five years , " @entity125 said			0
researchers from @entity135 , however , report that after taking tamoxifen for 10 years , the risk of a woman 's cancer coming back was reduced by 30 % and the risk of dying from the cancer was reduced by nearly half			0
these are n't the final results of the @entity108 trial , which is a huge clinical trial			0
nearly 13,000 women were enrolled between 1996 and 2005 , and researchers presented eight - year follow - up data from about 7,000 of them at @entity148			0
there are side effects from taking this drug , including an elevated risk of endometrial cancer			2
but the risks are far smaller than the benefits , say researchers			0
@entity109 has been around long enough that a generic version is available and costs about $ 100 per month			0
once the final results of @entity108 are in and it 's compared to other similar studies , the standard of care for these patients will probably change from five to 10 years , according to the editorial accompanying the study in @entity165			0
@entity166 : breast cancer more deadly in black women 3			1
twice as much is better with the drug fulvestrant doubling the dose of a drug called fulvestrant improved survival in postmenopausal women who have estrogen - receptor positive breast cancer that has either spread in or outside the breast , according to one study			1
@entity178 works by blocking the action of estrogen on cancer cells , according to the @entity182			0
it was approved at a 250 mg dose , @entity125 said			0
but @entity186 researchers found a dose of 500 mg led to four months more of survival without the cancer getting worse and a 19 % reduction in the risk of death , according to dr. @entity193 , who heads the department of medical oncology at the @entity196 , @entity197 in @entity198 , @entity186			0
twice as long is not better with the drug @entity200 women who are diagnosed with early stage @entity204 positive breast cancer , another type of breast cancer , will be put on a drug called @entity200 , an artificial antibody which binds to the cancer cell and kills it			1
giving @entity200 for a longer duration did not improve " disease - free or overall survival " over one year of treatment , research shows , said dr. @entity215 , chief of the medicine department at the @entity217 in @entity218 , @entity219 , president of the @entity221 and chair of the @entity223			1
@entity215 said this very large trial conducted in many countries ( not in the @entity226 ) confirms that the current regimen is still the best			0
study questions benefit of yearly mammograms 5			0
avastin is n't indicated for breast cancer researchers were hoping that combining the cancer @entity230 for one year with regular chemotherapy would help women with triple - negative breast cancer			1
this type of cancer , is very aggressive and has few effective treatment options			2
according to new data presented at @entity148 , adding @entity230 ( which stops the growth of blood vessels that help tumors grow ) did not improve a patient 's survival			2
sadly , researchers have nothing extra to add to standard chemotherapy for early , triple - negative breast cancer , said dr. @entity249 , professor of oncology at @entity251 in @entity252 , who presented the data at the conference			1
just over a year ago , the @entity255 withdrew its approval for @entity230 for treating breast cancer patients because a review of various studies showed @entity230 was not shown to be safe and effective for that use in this type of cancer			1
@entity230 is still approved for treating certain types of colon , lung , kidney and brain cancer ( glioblastoma multiforme ) .			1

research shows improved outcomes with some drugs at *higher* doses or for a longer time
one drug , @entity230 , fails to show promise as treatment for triple - negative breast cancer
" @entity18 " actually begins before chemotherapy does , according to one study
