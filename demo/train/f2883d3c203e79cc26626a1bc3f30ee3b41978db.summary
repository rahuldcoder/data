his full name is @entity2 , but you might just call him " @entity4			1
" that 's the buzzword adopted by the young @entity6 to describe the bright , independent and tech savvy entrepreneurs using creative thinking and the power of innovation to take over @entity13 's economic destiny			1
" over time @entity13 has relied on government and big multinationals for solutions -- but they 're not coming , " explains @entity2			2
" but of recent you 're seeing a new wave of young men and women who have access to all the global networks , who 've studied either within the continent or outside and have this passion for change -- these are the people @entity13 's change is going to come from , these are the people i call ' @entity30			1
' " and @entity2 is certainly leading by example			2
at just 33 years old , he has already been involved in several tech initiatives aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship and empowering communities across @entity13			0
connecting solutions to problems early last year , @entity2 co-founded the @entity37 in @entity6 , a technology space enabling ambitious entrepreneurs to come together and develop their trailblazing ideas into successful businesses			1
the @entity43 - based hub , one of the many innovation centers that have recently mushroomed across @entity13 , has so far incubated the efforts of more than 100 entrepreneurs , providing them with space , support and consulting			0
" part of our own responsibility is to connect the talent to the opportunity , " says @entity2			2
" we took the " i " out of innovation and replaced it with the " we " and came up with the @entity37 -- the problems of @entity13 are huge , they can not be solved by one person alone , so it requires people coming together			2
" access is key born in @entity6 to a family of academics , @entity2 says he learned from an early age the importance of access to information			1
growing up , he says , he was surrounded by books			0
" we had a mantra in our house , " remembers @entity2			2
" my dad would always say ' never get caught without a book , ' so whether you had lunch or you were sleeping , you always had to have your book			0
" read related : @entity13 's ' father of technology ' @entity2 went on to study computer science in @entity6 before moving to the @entity82 and the @entity83 to further his academic knowledge in entrepreneurship and global health			1
along the way , his entrepreneurial spirit kicked in -- he worked for multinationals such as @entity90 and @entity91 and also got involved in a number of startups			0
but @entity13 was always bound to be central to @entity2 's work			1
passionate about his continent , he quickly ventured into what he describes as " the business of technology in health and education			1
" ' an app a day keeps the doctor away ' as a result , @entity2 co-founded @entity104 , a health technology and management startup that leverages the rise of mobile phones and other low - cost technologies across @entity13 to provide access to vital health information			1
the startup won the 2012 @entity113 -- in collaboration with the @entity115 -- for @entity116 , a low - cost device that enables blood pressure monitoring and data transmission via mobile phones			0
the technology hence acts as a communication channel for doctors to remotely send treatment recommendations to their patients			0
the concept is this : at the moment you put mobile phone on everybody 's hands , how can it comes to that ... instead of people going to the hospital , the hospital comes to you , " @entity2 says			2
" growing up , they used to tell us an apple a day keeps the doctor away , now it 's more like an app a day keeps the doctor away			0
" @entity104 , which comes from a @entity142 word for complete health , is also working to create a cloud - based service that will receive the mobile phone data and store them in an electronic health record			0
' bringing online education to an offline world ' but perhaps @entity2 's most daring project to date is @entity150 : an ambitious initiative aiming to change @entity13 's education landscape by putting learning resources to the hands of students and teachers across the continent			1
@entity2 explains that due to broadband constraints many young @entity13 are losing out in the major shift toward open education in parts of the developed world , where massive open online courses are offered for free			1
" that 's where i step in , " he says			0
" i come from the developing world but i have had access to this good education and so my goal is to bridge that gap -- to knock down that barrier of broadband			0
" read also : web savvy @entity13 fuel growth in online shopping still at testing stage , @entity150 aims to deploy @entity177 , an offline wireless cloud device , in key community areas to house and host online educational tools			0
the device , which was incubated at the @entity37 , will do a one - time download , store the content and make it available for people nearby to access it through their wi - fi enabled devices			1
" it 's about bringing online education to an offline world , " says @entity2			2
legacy of ' @entity30 ' multifarious and passionate , @entity2 says his mission as an " @entity4 " is to enable access to information so that people can tap into their own creativity to solve their problems without having to rely on government			1
" a lot of times we 're focused too much on trying to solve people 's problems			0
but people are the ones who best know their own problems but often can lack the tools they need , " he says			0
" when you give people access to health education , they will take better care of their health ; when you give people access to education , you will see people even do greater things , " adds @entity2			1
" we enable people to access -- when they know , they will solve their problems			0
