@entity4 the massacre of some of @entity3 's top cartoonists has turned a @entity7 nightmare -- that @entity9 jihadists could return from war on terror battlefields to wreak carnage at home -- into reality			2
one of the two brothers suspected in the slaughter at the offices of a satirical magazine on wednesday recently spent time in @entity21 getting weapons training with one of the most dangerous @entity25 affiliates in the world , @entity7 officials briefed on the matter told @entity5 's @entity28			0
and a @entity3 source close to the @entity3 security services says there is also evidence that one of the brothers , @entity35 and @entity36 , has traveled to the the killing fields of @entity38			0
the chilling revelations open up a potentially dangerous new phase of the struggle against global terrorism because thousands of @entity44 fighters are estimated to be fighting with @entity45 and other extremist groups -- a rich pool of radicals who could overwhelm @entity9 intelligence agencies should they come home with orders to sow terrorist panic at home			1
top officials in @entity4 have another deeply held fear			0
since many @entity9 jihadists have @entity59 passports , they enjoy visa - free access to the @entity7 , opening the possibility that someone -- not known to @entity7 and allied intelligence services and who is not on @entity7 no - fly lists like the @entity36 brothers -- could get into the @entity7			2
" that 's what multiplies our problem , " @entity67 rep @entity67 told @entity5 on thursday			0
" them returning to @entity44 is a direct threat to them eventually , potentially coming here			0
" the paramilitary - style assault on the satirical @entity3 publication @entity78 killed 12 people also underscored a shift away from spectacular , large - scale attacks waged by foreign terror groups like the strike on sept. 11 , 2001			1
instead , homegrown radicals inspired by or affiliated with jihadist organizations are launching more limited strikes that still achieve the core aim of terrorism : death , widespread fear and panic			1
the shift makes the task of preventing further terrorist attacks even more daunting for @entity9 leaders			1
they must sift through countless clues of potential small - scale , lone - wolf attacks while also blunting the possibility of another massive strike that could kill thousands in a single incident			1
" it is becoming a more and more complex terrorist threat , " homeland security secretary @entity102 told @entity5 's @entity103			0
these are " actors who may lurk within our society , that could strike with little notice , commit an act of violence because they have been inspired by things they have seen on the @entity113 , social media , in literature , without accepting a direct order from ... a terrorist organization			2
" the plague of homegrown terror by radicals inspired by -- and sometimes affiliated with -- @entity25 , @entity45 and other groups , seems to be spreading across the globe			1
in october , a convert to @entity126 and self - appointed jihadist provoked terror in @entity129 -- @entity131 's sleepy capital city -- by gunning down a soldier standing guard at a national war memorial			1
two days earlier , a @entity131 soldier was killed by a @entity136 convert using a car as a deadly weapon			0
just last month , a single hostage taker , apparently inspired by @entity45 , seized a cafe in another unlikely terror hot spot -- @entity142 , @entity143 -- killing two people before he was shot dead by police			1
and in 2013 , homegrown terror hit @entity148 , when two @entity150 @entity136 converts turned extremists hacked soldier @entity152 to death in a brazen daylight attack			1
@entity67 rep. @entity155 of @entity156 , chairman of the @entity157 , said the sheer simplicity of the attack in @entity160 , in which masked gunmen drove up to the @entity78 offices and started spraying automatic weapons was particularly disturbing			1
" that 's what keeps me up at night			0
the small scale attack that goes undetected , " he said			1
in this new front on the war on terror , extremists no longer need to infiltrate fighters on daring missions to set off car bombs in @entity44 cities or to hijack fuel - laden airplanes to knock down skyscrapers			1
they can instead call on willing recruits already in the midst of @entity9 societies , inspired by increasingly targeted calls by groups like @entity45 and @entity25 to wage war at home			1
so far , there are no signs that wednesday 's attack will lead to a heightened risk of terrorist actions in the @entity7			2
but the @entity189 has long voiced fears that because of visa waiver programs with the @entity7 , @entity44 enjoy easy entry onto @entity7 soil , and radicals armed with nothing more than their maroon @entity59 passports could , in theory , export their terror			1
senior @entity7 intelligence and law enforcement officials working closely with @entity3 counterparts will be especially keen to find out whether those behind the @entity160 attacks are veterans of @entity45 ' fight in @entity38			1
the fact that thousands of radicalized , trained and battle - hardened killers with the skills and motivation to attack @entity9 targets could be coming home from war is deeply concerning to @entity7 counterterrorism officials			2
" if these are foreign fighters coming back , it would be our worst fears realized , " said rep. @entity213 , @entity214 , a member of the @entity215			2
but even if the attackers in @entity160 are not veterans of jihadism , they still may reflect a troubling evolution in the nature of terrorism , one that is especially hard for national security officials to combat			2
@entity45 , which has carved up large swaths of territory in @entity38 and @entity231 , has sought to inspire attacks on @entity9 soil			2
it emerged recently in @entity143 that the group 's leaders had told potential fighters not to travel to @entity38 , but to stage attacks at home			2
" this really is a pattern , " said @entity239 , the former chairman of the @entity215 , who is now a @entity5 national security analyst			0
" it is new in that they were able to pull it off			0
" @entity245 , an expert on international terrorism at the @entity247 , said the risk to the @entity7 from @entity44 fighters believed to have returned home after fighting in @entity38 and elsewhere was significant			0
around 150 @entity7 are believed to have also joined the fight with @entity45			0
@entity245 also said videos of the assailants on the streets of @entity160 during the attack suggested they had some level of sophistication , a factor that will also alarm @entity7 @entity260 officials			1
" they were not a couple of guys who woke up one day last week " and decided to launch an attack , @entity245 said			0
" i am guessing they had battlefield experience			0
" @entity268 , a former @entity269 envoy to @entity136 communities , said the @entity160 attack was particularly serious because it suggested radical @entity126 groups were now succeeding in their campaign to use propaganda and social media to radicalize @entity136 to stay in their home nations to conduct terrorism			1
" some of the messaging has been focused on ' do what you can to help the cause from where you are , ' " said @entity268 , now with the @entity283			0
" they are trying to activate people where they stand			0
that is obviously scary and moving into a newish front			0
" that kind of motivational rhetoric has shown to be effective in the @entity7 as well			0
@entity292 maj. @entity291 was reportedly inspired by the teachings of and emails from @entity21 - based @entity126 cleric @entity295 before going on a shooting rampage at a base in @entity298 , @entity156 , in 2009 , killing 13 people			2
the @entity189 said wednesday that it is paying attention to the risk posed by foreign fighters and the inspiration radicals could find from jihadist groups abroad			1
" as a general matter , we are very mindful of the threat from foreign fighters and the threat and the need to try to counter some of the extremist ideology that @entity45 is propagating using some pretty sophisticated social media strategies , " said @entity189 spokesman @entity305			0
@entity314 , a former @entity269 counterterrorism official now at @entity315 , said the @entity160 attack showed an evolution of terrorism in a number of ways			1
" there has n't been , to my knowledge , a major jihadist attack involving assault weapons in the @entity330 in memory , " @entity314 said , and also noted that it was significant that wednesday 's assault took place in @entity3 , which despite having @entity44 's biggest @entity136 population , has been largely spared large - scale attacks by radicalized @entity126			1
@entity314 cautioned that it remained unclear whether the attackers in the @entity160 incident were linked or inspired by @entity45 or another radical terror group like one of the various branches of @entity25			1
but he said it was increasingly likely that @entity45 successes in holding onto territory in the @entity341 were having an impact in the @entity330			0
" we have seen , just in the last few months , whether it is in @entity142 or in @entity129 or in other places , that the perceived successes of @entity45 in holding territory in @entity231 and in @entity38 have had a galvanizing effect on those with radical tendencies , " he said			0
" i fear this is something we are going to have to get used to			0

@entity160 attack underscores shift away from spectacular , large - scale attacks waged by foreign terror groups
instead , homegrown radicals inspired by or affiliated with jihadist organizations are launching more limited strikes
