-- as the fallout from @entity7 continues , the debate over whether or not the alleged leaker is a treasonous villain or a @entity5 hero is being debated in @entity8 , @entity9			1
there , the @entity10 was set to vote on a resolution that hails @entity13			1
@entity14 a hero , calls for his immediate release and for charges against him to be dropped			1
that vote was postponed on thursday , pending more information on @entity14 's involvement			1
here , the author of the resolution , @entity23 , tells @entity0 why he thinks @entity14 is a hero , while city council member @entity24 explains why he is against the measure			1
-- @entity26 manning : an @entity28 hero @entity23 is a commissioner and immediate past chair of the city of @entity8 's @entity31			1
he is a national committee member of the @entity32 , member of courage to @entity35 , an organization that supports @entity37 war resisters , and a member of the steering committee of the @entity40 , which raises money for @entity14 's defense			1
on tuesday , the @entity10 of @entity8 , @entity9 will vote on whether or not to pass a resolution recommended to it by the @entity44 , which asks it to support @entity13			1
@entity14 and proclaim him a hero -- if he is indeed the whistle - blower who leaked the " collateral murder " video and numerous classified documents to @entity7			1
@entity14 is charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces 52 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges against him			1
i wrote the resolution that is before the @entity10			2
i believe that if @entity14 is the whistle - blower , he is an @entity28 hero and should be released			1
@entity8 should set a courageous example for the rest of the country by acknowledging the good that has been done by whoever blew the whistle			1
@entity14 is alleged to have written in e-mail exchanges made before he was arrested that the results of his actions would be " hopefully worldwide discussion , debates , and reforms			1
" in another exchange , he allegedly wrote : " i want people to see the truth regardless of who they are because without information , you can not make informed decisions as a public			0
" @entity14 's case can not be discussed without also discussing @entity7			1
whoever released the video known as " @entity51 , " which documents an incident in a suburb of @entity84 on july 12 , 2007 , should be thanked by the people of the world			0
that video shows the killings of 12 unarmed civilians , including two @entity91 journalists by a @entity94 @entity93 crew			0
two children were severely injured in the attack			0
@entity7 released the " @entity51 " video in april			1
in july , it released the @entity97			0
in october , it released the @entity98 , and last month it released diplomatic cables			0
the @entity97 tells us of corruption and cover - ups in @entity103 , the killing of innocent @entity105			0
the @entity98 document numerous war crimes and suppression of evidence of torture , and the recently released diplomatic cables shed an embarrassing light on the conduct of diplomats around the world			0
@entity7 has been accused of endangering the lives of @entity103 informers by not redacting their names			2
beginning with the release of the @entity98 , @entity7 did redact names			2
but the accusers of @entity7 persist in the game of " what if			2
" what if it endangered lives ? the mistake of nonredacted names must be weighed against the reality of the lives already destroyed by the wars in @entity103 and in @entity131 and the lives that would be lost if this information was not leaked in an effort to end some illegal acts of war			0
what if these revelations , in the name of compliance with law and morality , were not revealed ? how many more innocent lives would then be sacrificed ? democracy must be transparent or it is not democracy			0
it is the duty of citizens to participate in democracy and shine light on truth			0
@entity151 said that given a choice between having government and having newspapers , he would choose newspapers			0
blowing the whistle on war crimes is not a crime			0
it is the war criminals who should be prosecuted			0
@entity162 has been saying that @entity14 is a hero of his and that when he released the @entity163 , everything that is now being said about @entity14 , including that he is a traitor , was also said about @entity162 at the time			1
manning , or whoever leaked the information he is accused of leaking , deserves our thanks			2
it took 30 years for the heroes , who interrupted the @entity174 massacre to be honored with the awarding of the @entity176 , the @entity94 's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy			0
at the award ceremony , army maj. gen. @entity181 said , " it was the ability to do the right thing even at the risk of their personal safety that guided these soldiers to do what they did , " and that the three " set the standard for all soldiers to follow			0
the city of @entity8 has a long tradition of standing up for peace and for justice			1
it has opposed the wars in @entity131 and in @entity103 , it has opposed torture , and it is one of the cities that called for the impeachment of @entity201			0
manning and the case against him now represent the culmination of all the horror and repression that we have experienced in the last decade			0
the @entity208 now has the opportunity to weigh in on the side of all that is right on the road to repairing the damage done to the world by the policies and the cover - ups of the last decade			2
for the greater good , @entity8 should ask the secretary of the army , the @entity219 @entity218 , and chief of staff of the @entity94 , gen. @entity221 , to release manning from pretrial confinement and drop the charges against him			2
if @entity14 is the whistle - blower , justice necessitated his actions			2
it 's irresponsible , premature to declare manning a hero @entity24 was elected to the @entity208 in 2002			1
a retired nuclear chemist , he was a research scientist at @entity231 for more than 30 years			0
he was a commissioner on the city 's @entity232 , and the @entity234 , and currently serves on the @entity235			2
yes , i am a city council member in @entity8 , a place known for bucking the establishment and for opposing the wars in @entity131 and @entity103			1
i also oppose these wars , but unlike some of my colleagues in city government , i do not believe that @entity13			1
@entity14 should be declared a hero or freed from prison before all the evidence against him is presented in court			1
@entity14 is accused of disclosing classified information to @entity7 , including diplomatic cables and military logs of incidents in @entity103 and @entity131			1
a military grand jury is investigating charges that he mishandled classified information in a way likely to cause injury to the @entity28			2
he is being held in military confinement pending trial			0
@entity8 's @entity31 has publicly proclaimed manning a hero for releasing classified information about the wars it opposes			1
it 's odd enough to lionize someone accused of breaking the law and potentially putting individuals and our government in harm 's way			0
but the commission 's declaration is even odder in this case , because @entity14 has pleaded not guilty and denied the charges against him			2
what @entity8 's commission members seem to have forgotten is that before their hero can be judged innocent or guilty , he deserves a fair trial with all the due process rights guaranteed by our @entity281			1
when @entity14 joined the @entity94 , he swore to uphold the @entity281			2
he signed papers promising to keep secret all classified documents to which he had access			2
he was aware of the laws governing the unauthorized release of secret documents			0
if he stole classified documents and released them to @entity7 , he broke both his word and the law			1
if he did not like the war , the @entity94 or the conduct of his country , there are ways to make his dissent known without breaking the law and damaging our country			0
to achieve peaceful solutions to international conflicts involves diplomacy , which requires confidential communications			0
stealing and publishing secret diplomatic dispatches obviously harms this effort			0
furthermore , publishing a secret list of vital infrastructure , from pipelines to smallpox - vaccine suppliers -- without regard for the potential consequences -- is deeply disturbing			0
the city of @entity8 has many important problems , including high taxes and unemployment , severe rates of property crime , a decaying physical infrastructure and location next to a major earthquake fault			1
in addition , it needs to improve the business climate to create more jobs and revenue for vital public services			0
@entity8 businesses were harmed by a boycott after the @entity330 recruiting station was deemed " unwelcome			2
" now the @entity14 resolution has led people to call for a boycott again			1
in this difficult economic climate , the city 's business community can ill afford such bad publicity and associated financial losses			2
it was irresponsible and premature for the @entity31 to recommend the release of @entity14 before hearing the evidence presented in his trial and the council should deny this resolution			1
the council should not encourage military personnel to leak classified material by declaring manning a hero			1
many young men and women are serving overseas in two very difficult wars with no defined front and an enemy who does not wear uniforms			0
let us work together to resolve these conflicts honorably and welcome the troops home			0
the opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity23 authored a resolution for @entity208 calling @entity13 . @entity14 a hero
he says @entity365 , if he is source for @entity7 , deserves thanks for exposing *official* *wrongdoing*
@entity8 city council member @entity24 says @entity14 should have day in court
he says passing resolution would encourage others to leak classified material
