@entity0 said friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by @entity6 drug dealers allied with the @entity8 drug cartel to establish a foothold in @entity10			1
but an expert on the @entity6 drug war , @entity13 , disputed that assertion			1
" they 're already operating in @entity10 , " he told @entity15 in a telephone interview , citing reports of the cartel shipping drugs to ports in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity25 is the principal gateway for drugs coming to @entity10 , @entity13 said			1
the operation , dubbed " @entity30 " and carried out in collaboration with the @entity32 , resulted in the arrests in @entity34 of four members of the cartel , which is run by @entity37 , also known as " @entity37 , " police said in a statement			1
@entity39 was initiated in may 2009 by the @entity32 's office in @entity41 , @entity42 , which was looking into the cartel , said the statement			0
in october 2010 , agents from the @entity32 met with the @entity0 's @entity47 after learning of the cartel 's alleged plans to expand operations in @entity10 , it said			1
the bulk of the investigation unfolded in the @entity54 , where @entity54 agents discovered that cartel members were planning to travel to @entity25 , a trip that occurred the following march , the statement said			2
once the suspects were inside @entity25 , they were placed under tight surveillance by @entity25 police , it said			1
" thanks to the exchange of information with the @entity32 , one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship , hidden in containers with legal , declared cargo , " it said			0
" they adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations , and sent various containers without any type of drug			0
finally , they sent their first shipment in a boat from @entity85			0
the container , which was intercepted in late july in the @entity87 , concealed 373 kilos of cocaine			0
" investigators identified @entity91 , who moved to @entity34 to oversee the operation , as a member of the group , it said			0
a few days later , he was joined by @entity95 , a cousin of " @entity37 " and considered the leader of the group ; @entity99 , a principal collaborator , and @entity101 , who was overseeing the organization 's " legal " affairs , it said			1
the four men , aged 37 to 52 , were arrested near their hotels in @entity34 , it said			2
they had been sought by @entity54 authorities for drug trafficking , money laundering and other charges			0
their hotel rooms contained $ 5,500 , about 3,000 euros and 4,000 @entity6 pesos , it said			2
if indeed " @entity37 " @entity95 's cousin was among the men arrested , " that is a big deal , " said @entity13 , whose books " @entity114 " and " @entity116 , " focus on the @entity6 drug war			1
though he said he had never heard of the man , " as a relative , he 's clearly an envoy of sorts			0
he 's not just some low - level conejo -- rabbit scout			0
" @entity13 said friday 's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies			2
" as the drug wars come under fire from many quarters , one of the big advances that has been made has been intelligence sharing between @entity54 agencies and their foreign counterparts , and this is further proof of that			0
