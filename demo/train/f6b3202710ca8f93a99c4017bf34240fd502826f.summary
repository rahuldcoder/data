@entity0 was arrested as she waited to fly out of a @entity2 airport in 2007			1
her crime ? a blog calling for women 's equality in the @entity6			1
originally on her way to a cyber-journalism workshop in @entity10 , @entity0 , then in her mid-twenties , was transferred to @entity14 's notorious @entity13 prison and at midnight , the interrogation began			1
according to the authorities , says @entity0 , challenging the inequality and injustice that women face in @entity6 was " acting against national security and being a spy for western countries			1
" @entity0 is one of three women featured in a new documentary , " @entity27 , " that follows the lives of female dissident bloggers across the globe			1
these women pay a high price for their blogs -- suffering violence , harassment and detainment by some of the world 's most repressive regimes			1
" they do n't use political propaganda , they do n't make speeches , they do n't try to change things really aggressively -- they are trying to start a dialogue and i think this is why the world started noticing them , " said @entity36 , director of " @entity27 , " who was struck by the personal nature of blogging and how it allows ordinary people to talk about the difficulties they face			1
" i think this is a way that women tell stories and how women try to change the world			0
" friday marks @entity53 , and this year the is emphasis is on securing freedom of expression in all media , including a free and open internet -- something @entity0 can identify with			2
she told @entity61 : " in countries like my country , you learn to censor yourself from a very early age and you become good at censoring yourself , unfortunately			0
the @entity66 of @entity6 makes each of us an example of it because we also censor each other			2
" " it 's sad when one day you figure out that you want freedom so badly but you are also part of the censoring system			0
" after a series of interrogations and heavy censorship of her blog by the @entity6 authorities , @entity0 left @entity6 in 2007 and now lives in @entity80			1
as a women 's activist and blogger means it 's unlikely she will return home while the current @entity6 regime is in power			2
and for her family 's safety she now blogs anonymously			0
@entity90 's @entity89 , perhaps the most well - known of the three female bloggers featured in @entity36 's film , continues to speak out against the @entity94 government on her blog , " @entity97 , " which receives millions of hits each month			1
she was finally granted a passport by @entity90 authorities in january after 20 failed applications , and her recent high profile trip to the @entity102 , where she visited the @entity103 , has turned the media spotlight on the daily struggle of many in communist @entity90			2
some of the film 's most sinister scenes show @entity112 blogger @entity111 under house arrest in @entity114 , harassed by security officials outside her apartment as she tries to leave			1
when her husband , @entity118 and environmental activist @entity119 , is sentenced to over three years in prison in 2008 , she was is left alone and isolated with their baby daughter and her blog , wondering if they will ever be free			0
since then , her blog has been censored in @entity112			2
in countries where the state has a monopoly on information , blogging has come into its own as a tool for change and an outlet for sharing stories , according to @entity36			0
" the governments really fear these women			0
i mean , they are women , talking about their daily lives but the governments fear that they are so outspoken , that they are talking about what 's really happening in their countries "			0
a refusal to be censored unites these women across cultures and continents , as they use their blogs to connect with the world outside of the regime			0
for @entity36 , the reaction of the authorities is perhaps the strongest indication of the strength of their individual voices			0
" i think blogging is an extremely powerful tool , you can reach the whole world with one voice			0

" @entity27 " follows lives of female dissident bloggers around world
female dissident bloggers often suffer violence , detainment by repressive regimes
film follows @entity6 's @entity0 , @entity90 's @entity89 , @entity112 's @entity111
