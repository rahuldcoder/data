-- " dear world : my fingers and wrists are sore , for the past few days all i could do was punch the letters on the keyboard ... " these were the words of one @entity9 man in @entity10 who spent days scouring the internet for news on the @entity9 protests that he could share			1
people from all over @entity9 and beyond poured out their feelings after what some say has been a heavy - handed police response to protests in @entity9			1
@entity0 alone received more than 1,000 ireports from @entity9 in less than a week from @entity9 compelled to document , protest and demand their voices be heard			1
the protests began over plans to replace an @entity26 park with a new development , but spread nationwide after a heavy - handed crackdown by police			2
@entity30 has defended his government 's handling of the protests , saying friday that the government has " no problem in terms of democratic demands			2
" he also acknowledged , again , that police may have used excessive force last week , and said he had ordered an investigation			0
" to the @entity41 : this is the first time in my 30 years that tears well up for what is happening just up the road from where i write these words			0
... " people from all ages and races , all political viewpoints are coming together to fight			0
notify your local and national media , and tag them on twitter to make them speak the truth about what is happening			2
this is ... for humanity , no less , " wrote @entity63 " ateloco " in a post that spread rapidly through social media			1
why @entity64 matters to the @entity9 @entity9 as a nation is quite savvy about social media			1
at least 2 million tweets with hashtags related to the @entity9 protests were sent in just eight hours on may 31 when protests gathered steam , a study by @entity68 revealed -- around 90 % of them from @entity9			1
in comparison , @entity76 's main protest hashtag was tweeted less than 1 million times throughout the country 's entire revolutionary period			0
and those in @entity9 like to talk on the issues -- 57 % of those using social network sites say they do so to share their political views -- a far higher percentage than in many @entity89 nations , according to the @entity90			1
the arrest this week of 25 social media users on accusations of spreading false information about demonstrations , according to the country 's semi-official @entity97 news service , has sparked concerns from human rights groups about the right of freedom of expression			1
but while documenting and disseminating information on the protests can be an arduous task , for many on social media it became a way of holding authorities to account			1
" i do n't know when it will end , but i already feel like a robot whose main role is to click the share button on @entity118 , " one activist , @entity26 resident @entity112 , told @entity0 after days of protests			2
she described the protests as her moment of " resurrection			2
" although she was n't involved in organizing them , she felt she could help the cause by sharing information			0
she wants the protests to lead to more self - examination on all sides			2
" we should n't stop , but we should act more consciously			0
we have to write , we have to share our thoughts			0
" @entity9 media in crisis over protests @entity133 is not currently living in his homeland , but working for a construction company in the @entity137 nation of @entity138			1
his heartfelt letter on @entity140 opened this story and continues : " i was guilty for letting my friends get gassed and arrested in the name of freedom without me			1
i was guilty for not being able to keep my colleagues company as they march to @entity64 straight off work			0
i was guilty for not being able to give the people my apartment to shelter , my food to eat , my water to drink and my vinegar to ease off the reaction from the chemicals sprayed on their bodies			0
" he hoped that by writing and collecting information -- even from far away -- he could be of some help			0
" i was no longer in @entity10 and i was no longer guilty			0
i became a reporter with quotes , cameraman with videos , photographer with images , a 24 - hour news channel with everything i posted on social media , " he said			1
@entity26 writer @entity168 was in the western coastal city of @entity170 when protests began			0
describing herself as a " pot and pan hitter " after the noisy protests she recorded one night , her thoughtful essay summed up the energy of the protests for many			0
if people are silent about the what is happening in @entity9 , the protesters " are afraid that as a society things will go backward , " she said			1
by shining a spotlight on the situation in the country , she hoped authorities would be less likely to retaliate against those involved in the protests , she said			0
ultimately , it may be too soon to tell what effect the protests will have on @entity9 , its government and those who flooded the streets of @entity26 , @entity198 and other cities			1
but one thing is certain ; those who have been feverishly tweeting , posting , blogging and documenting will not be inclined to stop any time soon			0
" for the first time in a long time , " @entity204 said , " @entity9 has much reason for pride			2
