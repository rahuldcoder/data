-- a resolute defensive display by @entity2 denied @entity3 a crucial away goal as the first leg of the @entity7 quarterfinal ended goalless at the @entity8 on wednesday			1
@entity10 's defending champions dominated possession in both halves but could n't find a way through @entity2 's defenses which were pushed to the limits at times			1
the @entity17 visitors were denied what looked like a clear penalty in the first half when @entity21 was brought down by goalkeeper @entity22 , but the referee remained unmoved			2
@entity24 , scorer of 55 goals in all competitions this season , did find the net in the 17th minute but was adjudged offside by the referee 's assistant			0
chances came and went for @entity3 , with perhaps the best of the second half falling to @entity21			1
but his efforts to poke the ball home after @entity24 's shot was parried were in vain as left back @entity39 slid in to produce a heroic goal - saving tackle			2
the @entity42 league leaders also had their moments in front of goal but squandered chances to take the lead , with @entity48 and @entity49 both failing to find the net			0
" i take it as a compliment that we have got this result , the team had a good game and i think it is a good result , " veteran @entity2 midfielder @entity59 said , @entity58 reported			1
" a goal could be enough in the @entity61 and we will have more of our players available			0
if we manage to play well we have chances to progress			0
" the two sides reconvene at the @entity61 next tuesday , with the winners playing either @entity66 or @entity67 in the semifinal			0
meanwhile at the @entity71 , 2010 finalists @entity69 took a giant step towards the semis with a 2 - 0 win over @entity75			1
goals in either half from striker @entity78 and @entity80 winger @entity79 sealed a satisfying result for the @entity83 's second - placed team , whose @entity85 stadium will host the may 19 final			1
@entity78 opened the scoring in the 44th minute after his weak shot found its way under the body of goalkeeper @entity92			1
it was the @entity95 striker 's 11th goal of the competition this season , putting him one short of @entity24 's leading tally			0
@entity80 winger @entity79 scored the visitors ' second away goal firing home from six yards in the 70th minute			2
" we realized our objective by winning here without conceding any goals			0
@entity75 play emotional football , so it was very important for us to get this result tonight , " said @entity69 coach @entity109			2
a semifinal tie against , in all probability , @entity113 awaits the winners of this quarterfinal tie , which also concludes next tuesday .			0
