@entity0 -- according to the @entity4 ' mission in @entity2 , 712 @entity2 were violently killed in april 2013			2
this is both normal and extraordinary			0
it is normal because it pales into comparison beside the monthly death toll in the worst years of the country 's civil war			1
it is extraordinary because it is the highest such figure since that civil war subsided five years ago			2
understanding the violence requires grasping three confluent trends : the increasingly authoritarian streak of @entity2 prime minister @entity18 , the rise of both peaceful and violent protest among @entity2 's aggrieved @entity22 minority ( a fifth of the population ) , and , finally , a regional trend of worsening sectarian tensions between @entity27 and @entity22			1
each of these strands is tightly woven together			0
it was the invasion of @entity2 a decade ago and the subsequent empowerment of its @entity27 majority that sparked fears of what @entity35 's @entity34 famously called a " @entity37 " from @entity38 to @entity39			1
prime minister @entity18 spent his years of exile under @entity42 in both those countries , and is widely seen as having aligned @entity2 more closely to @entity39 interests -- for instance , allowing @entity39 over-flights of arms to the @entity49 regime			1
this diplomatic shift compounded a political one			0
@entity18 has undermined political institutions that were designed to be independent , such as the central bank and election commission			0
he has seized personal control of key army and intelligence units , many of them @entity58 - backed , including the 6,000 - strong @entity2 @entity61			2

vice-president @entity67 , the most senior @entity22 figure in the government , was forced to flee @entity2 and was later sentenced to death			1
a year later in december 2012 , hundreds of bodyguards and staff of finance minister @entity73 , another senior @entity22 , were arrested , triggering major protests			2
and on april 23 , the situation worsened when @entity2 forces backed by helicopters killed dozens of peaceful @entity22 protesters in the town of @entity80			1
the town was seen by nearby @entity82 as a conduit for suicide bombers , and the government claimed that the protesters were harboring militants from a @entity22 militant group called the @entity88			0
@entity18 established a ministerial committee to look into the @entity80 episode and has made a few other concessions , but the damage was done : a previously peaceful movement has grown angrier and , in places , more violent			0
taken together , @entity18 's heavy - handed and sectarian actions have fanned flames that were never really extinguished			1
the result is a powerful sense of @entity22 victimhood with many policies , such as @entity101 ( the removal of @entity42 's party loyalists from positions of influence ) , seen as little more than collective punishment of @entity22			2
the new wave of @entity2 protest embodies this trend			0
the protests are concentrated in sunni - majority provinces			1
protesters frequently excoriate @entity39 's influence in @entity2 politics and acclaim the @entity22 - majority @entity114 ( @entity114 ) fighting the neighboring @entity49 regime			1
sometimes , their slogans are nakedly and belligerently sectarian			0
this naturally alienates many @entity2 shias , who resent being associated with a foreign power and see the @entity114 as retrograde , @entity123 - backed jihadists rather than freedom fighters			0
they are also likelier to see @entity18 's various power - grabs as necessary steps to bring order and security to @entity2 in the face of a growing regional and domestic threat from @entity22 extremists such as @entity133 and its ideological brethren			1
@entity2 's increasingly autonomous @entity82 , buoyed by potentially vast oil reserves , share some of these fears and sit in uneasy alliance with @entity27 political groups			1
indeed , the @entity38 civil war has widened @entity2 's sectarian divisions and created a source of major instability			1
in march , around 50 @entity38 soldiers who had fled into @entity2 were ambushed and killed			0
the single most powerful @entity38 rebel group , @entity144 , is an offshoot of @entity133 in @entity2 , and its personal and logistical networks run across the @entity38 - @entity2 border			0
if @entity49 were to fall , this would have a catalytic effect on parts of @entity2 , amplifying @entity22 militancy and resulting in a flood of weapons of fighters across the border			2
does this mean that @entity2 is fated to return to the dark days of 2006 - 2007 , when death squads were run in the heart of government and @entity158 faced waves of ethnic cleansing ? it is important to note that while @entity2 itself bleeds , the @entity2 state is strong			2
@entity18 is vulnerable in sunni - majority areas where the @entity22 militias of the @entity167 movement provide security , but his large and cohesive security forces serve as a buffer against wider chaos			1
moreover , many @entity22 groups are eager to keep the violence in check , having previously suffered greatly at the hands of @entity133 in @entity2			1
it is certainly too early to talk about the country 's break - up			1
next year 's parliamentary elections will be a pivotal moment			0
at the last elections in 2010 , the @entity22 - dominated but secular @entity182 bloc won more seats but could n't form a government , and eventually let @entity18 take the top spot			1
this time round , it will be harder for @entity18 to outmaneuver his political rivals : they have learnt that power sharing is a sham , and the @entity82 are in a stronger position			0
in provincial elections held last month , @entity18 's coalition saw its vote share decline , with many of his harder - line @entity198 rivals faring better			2
another victory for @entity18 under contested conditions would produce severe political instability , especially if present levels of violence continue			0
the imperative is for political accommodation , reconciliation , and compromise			0
yet @entity18 is unlikely to opt for this route as long as he feels he can keep his grip on power with the help of his swollen army , paramilitary , and intelligence apparatus			0
there is no obvious way out for @entity2			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

monthly death toll has *doubled* in @entity2 ; now highest figure since end of war
increasing toll is related to authoritarian streak of *pm* @entity18 , says @entity219
@entity219 : sectarian is closely linked to protests , concentrated in @entity22 - majority areas
too early to talk about @entity2 's break - up , he says , but there 's no obvious way out of violence
