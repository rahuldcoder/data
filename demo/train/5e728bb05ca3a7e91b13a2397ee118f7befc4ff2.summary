that 's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend			0
" sales was known for his long - running children 's show " lunch with @entity1 , " which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie - throwing antics			1
the comedy show featured skits that culminated in sales getting walloped with pies in the face			1
what are your memories of sales ? " @entity1 was the last of the great tv comics when you talk about @entity42 , @entity43 , right down to @entity44 , " @entity13 said			2
" but it was bigger than that , because he used a children 's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids ' show and do a wild , unrehearsed , wacky improv for a half - hour every day for 15 years			1
" he could also inflame the authorities			0
one @entity56 , upset at being asked to work , he asked his youthful audience to send him those " green pieces of paper " from their parents ' wallets			0
though he did n't receive much -- he told the @entity62 he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank			0
later in his career , he was a regular on tv game shows , such as " @entity67 , " " to @entity68 " and " what 's my line ? " sales recently fell backstage at a local emmy awards show in @entity12 and developed serious ailments after that , @entity13 said			2
