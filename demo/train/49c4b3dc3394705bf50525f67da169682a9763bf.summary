@entity0 , @entity1 -- the gunbattle was so close it rattled the walls			2
i grabbed my camera and pointed it out the window , looking toward @entity8			2
from more than 10 stories up , i filmed the chaos			1
protesters were all around , ramming into the lines of police officers			2
black smoke hung in the air			2
i saw a medic shot in the arm			2
he was helped to safety			2
i saw at least 20 wounded people carried away			0
but the gunmen could not be seen			0
people looked skyward , scanning rooftops for snipers			1
at one point , a crowd of protesters stormed this hotel			1
they searched , floor to floor , trying to confirm a rumor that snipers were shooting from here			0
then there was another rumor about what was in the lobby of this hotel			1
i clutched my camera and ran down the stairs			0
little did i know then that i was about to see even more misery in what would turn out to be the worst day i 've seen since arriving in @entity0			1
as i ran , i noticed bullet holes in the stairwell windows			1
three had pierced through a second - floor window			0
three more had shattered through another window			0
and then i saw the bodies			1
there were five bodies underneath the stairs , lifeless feet peeking out of the white sheets that covered them			1
there were more bodies lined up just feet from the reception desk			1
they were wrapped in white sheets and red splotches bled through			0
a priest paced back and forth			0
we were told that the priest had blessed the bodies even though people were still trying to find out who the victims were			1
protesters went through the pockets of the fallen , searching for identification cards			0
we were told that the wounded and dying had to be brought to the closest place			0
that 's why this hotel had been chosen			1
there were no ambulances , just people struggling to drag in the fallen			0
this happened just hours after the @entity1 government declared a truce in the fighting here that has shocked the world			0
clearly , the truce had not held			0
a day ago this looked like a typical hotel lobby			1
now it was a makeshift morgue			1
we were told later that in all 13 people had been rushed into this hotel , three of them clinging to life			1
none of them made it			0
on the other side of the lobby someone was wiping streaks of blood off the white marble floor			2
outside , gunfire still rang out			0
and they continue to bring in bodies			2
