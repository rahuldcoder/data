-- forget the macho world of the standard shoot - ' em up video game			1
rather than relying on blood , gore and mayhem , a number of game developers are tapping into their inner emotions , inviting gamers along for adventures of the psyche			2
recent releases " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " evoked an emotional response by creating characters with which gamers could identify and empathize			0
now " @entity27 " ups the stakes with its story of two people surviving in a post-apocalyptic world -- @entity28 , a grizzled man who has seen too much , and @entity27 , a young girl who could be the future of the world			1
" the thing we heard consistently ( from focus groups ) was ' i 've never cared for characters as much as i 've cared for @entity28 and @entity27 , ' " @entity34 creative director @entity33 told @entity0			1
" there are moments we want to show close - ups , we want to show really subtle performances , and that 's where cut scenes are really useful			1
but we really use interaction to get you to connect , between @entity27 and @entity28 , in a way you could n't do in film			1
" it 's an increasingly popular approach in a segment of gaming where ammo and attitude have traditionally reigned supreme			0
in " @entity16 , " players journeyed with a young and unsure @entity56 through an early adventure in her career			1
they got to experience her anguish and joy as the star of the long - running franchise made her first kill or rescued close friends			0
with " @entity17 , " an entire team was devoted to bringing the @entity67 character to life			1
that level of care and precision resulted in a character who evoked a visceral response from the player -- one so real , designers said , that gamers would feel like they 're part of something larger than playing a game			1
" @entity27 " designers at @entity34 wanted to bring different elements together to get gamers to feel attached to @entity28 and @entity83			1
it had to be more than just intense moments , they said ; it needed to come together seamlessly and sell their relationship to the player			1
the game action is centered on a fungal outbreak that possesses humans and transforms them into ... well , zombies			0
@entity28 is older and has seen life on both sides of the outbreak			0
@entity27 , just 14 , was born into the post-outbreak world			1
their different viewpoints on life and how it should be lived were important to developing the relationship between the two characters			0
" how much we dedicate to those characters and building those characters and have those characters shift and change and go through these dynamic arcs and the gameplay supports that , " studio director @entity105 said			0
" they feed off each other			0
" early reactions suggest the dynamic works			0
" we 've had people cry when playing the game for us , " @entity33 said			1
" there are about three spots in the game where people cry			2
two of those are in cut scenes , and one of those is in game play			0
" he said he thinks the gameplay scene is the most powerful			0
" you are so invested in the characters , and you 're using these mechanics and then all of the sudden ... i ca n't say too much without spoiling it , but we flip a mechanic on its head and it does n't do what you expect because of where the characters are at , " @entity33 said			2
" you see people just lose it , and it 's awesome			2
" @entity105 and @entity33 said they used different literary sources as inspiration for the game 's emotional journey			0
one movie , in particular , struck a chord with both			0
" we came out of ' @entity157 , wide - eyed , going , ' @entity155 , what just happened ? ' and ' could you ever experience that tension and emotion in a video game ? can you achieve that with a joystick in your hand ? ' " @entity105 said			2
" in this world , anything can happen , and you as the player get to control that outcome and feel that tension			2
" but are gamers looking to cry over their characters ? is there a danger of turning off gamers because they may get too emotionally involved ? both " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " garnered commercial and critical success , suggesting that hard - core players are open to more than just another shooter			1
each asked the player to take a fresh look at some familiar gaming situations , using the main characters as a canvas on which to create the experience			0
" @entity27 " similarly asks players to tackle a challenging question -- in the horrible circumstances in which many games are set , how do you find , and define , your humanity ? " that 's what all good true drama is based on -- that conflict and difficult choices and the human experience , " @entity105 said			1
@entity33 said he wants players to come away thinking about deep issues , such as the dynamics of relationships and what it takes to keep them alive			2
you play the game and you 're going to have moments , " he said			2
" that 's what we 've set out to do			0
we want to give people moments			1
" " @entity27 " is available worldwide			1
the game is a @entity207 exclusive title			0
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , sexual themes and strong language .			0

in new *top* video games , designers are working hard to move players emotionally
" @entity27 " follows a *duo* who bond for survival in a post-apocalyptic world
" @entity226 : @entity228 " and " @entity56 " similarly invested in character development
one of designers for " last " : " we want to give people moments "
