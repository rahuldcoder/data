-- six major @entity2 websites have launched a joint site dedicated to eradicating online rumors , as part of @entity7 's efforts to clean up false information on the country 's wildly popular microblogs , state media reports			1
the rumor - busting website -- the name of which translates as the " websites jointly debunking rumors platform " -- allows users to forward on suspect content for verification			2
the website , with guidance from the @entity2 government , will then issue a " correct " version of the information			2
the web giants participating in the platform include @entity26 , a @entity28 - like microblogging service , and major search engines including @entity30 and @entity31 , reported state - run @entity32			1
the website , which launched thursday , has already published and corrected nearly 100,000 pieces of misinformation , according to the state - run @entity35			0
it would also alert internet users to phishing scams			1
@entity2 has more internet users than any other country , with more than 500 million people online , and an estimated 300 million microblog users			1
although the services are censored -- with sensitive terms blocked and posts deleted -- the speed with which information can be disseminated has proven a headache for @entity7			2
while the microblogs have been used to disseminate false information -- popular posts include reports of extraterrestrial sightings , and bogus pictures have circulated with false reports of natural disasters -- they have also become a forum for spreading news of scandals , protests and venting public anger at incidents such as the @entity66 bullet train crash			1
after that incident , which focused public opinion against authorities , a senior government official visited the headquarters of @entity72 and urged the internet firm to curb the spread of " false information , " while state media ran editorials comparing online rumors to heroin and cocaine in terms of the social damage they caused			1
social media companies began suspending users for posting what they deemed to be rumors			0
the state - run @entity35 has commended the government 's latest initiative in its rumor - busting campaign as " a laudable step , " saying that rumors could " can cause widespread panic , disturb the order of society and damage the government 's credibility			0
" the editorial said that online rumor prevention was " a challenge faced by most countries , " and pointed out that the @entity100 's @entity99 had launched a " rumor control " service in the wake of @entity104			2
but critics see the ongoing anti-rumor campaign as an attempt to censor criticism and manage public opinion			1
@entity112 , a researcher at the @entity115 's @entity114 , wrote in a 2011 blog that the government 's anti-rumor campaign was effectively " sugarcoating censorship as a kind of public health measure , " and observed that the government used the rumor - policing function to effectively shut down debate on contentious topics , without necessarily accounting why a given statement was false : " a rumor is what the government says it is			0
" @entity2 's rumor - busting efforts come as @entity132 authorities grapple with their own challenges with online speech , as calls escalate for action to prevent abuse against women on social media			1
the issue ignited when feminist @entity141 received a barrage of rape threats via @entity28 after petitioning to have women displayed on @entity132 banknotes			0
a politician who spoke out in support of her also received rape threats , while bomb threats were directed at a number of women journalists on @entity28			0
a 25 - year - old man was arrested in northeastern @entity153 tuesday on suspicion of harassment , the @entity155 said , while investigations were ongoing in relation to the more recent complaints			0
@entity159 contributed to this report .			0
