@entity0 -- the @entity2 , the giant gadget convention that wrapped up on friday , has brought some frustrating news for @entity6 or @entity7 customers who bought a cutting - edge 4g smartphone last year			1
that phone will soon be outdated			0
@entity6 and @entity7 unveiled some of the first smartphones that will tap into their new , even faster fourth - generation networks			1
but wait , @entity7 has been talking about its 4g network since launching one in 2008 followed by its premier phone , @entity17 's @entity15 , in 2010			1
and @entity6 began adding " @entity22 " to the names of many of its smartphones early last year			2
now , two of the largest @entity25 cellular carriers are ramping up yet another 4g system			0
they will have @entity27 , or @entity27 , to compete with the one @entity28 launched more than a year ago			2
@entity29 says it has @entity22 , which is similar to @entity6 's old @entity22 , but the carrier has not talked about plans for @entity27 deployment			1
( get all that ? ) since @entity6 and @entity7 have already exhausted their usage of @entity22 in marketing , it 's unclear how they will explain to customers the major investments they 've made to have the latest network technology			1
" i do n't think the majority of our customers understand the monikers , " @entity6 executive @entity40 said in an interview here at @entity2			1
@entity7 product chief fared @entity47 declined to comment on the company 's marketing plans			2
@entity40 , who serves as @entity6 's liaison to @entity51 , declined to comment on why @entity51 refused to adopt the @entity22 moniker in the @entity53 , which uses last year 's hspa + technology that @entity6 also describes as @entity22			1
" forget the @entity55 's for a second , " @entity40 said			0
" what it 's called does n't matter			0
" @entity28 has emphasized the speed enhancements offered by its version of @entity22 , and makes an effort to refer to the network as @entity27 , rather than just @entity22 , to differentiate from competitors , @entity64 , the technical chief for @entity28 , has told @entity1			2
@entity28 is on track to have its 4g network match the coverage of its 3g network by next year , a spokeswoman said friday			2
at @entity2 last year , @entity28 hosted two large news conferences and operated a huge booth to promote the launch of its 4g network			1
this year , @entity28 has kept a low profile			0
@entity6 announced eight new @entity27 products at @entity2 , including smartphones and tablets			1
the world 's first @entity78 , the @entity80 900 , will arrive in march , @entity77 wrote in a message to partners on friday			0
" we use this as a way to kick off the year , " @entity40 said			0
" @entity2 is becoming more wireless - centric than ever before			2
" @entity6 's loss in its bid to acquire @entity29 has not affected operations , according to @entity40			0
the first @entity27 phones for @entity6 hit stores in november , before the breakup with @entity29 was announced			1
at many of the large @entity2 exhibits , @entity22 was pervasive			0
for example , a station at the entrance to @entity98 's booth displaying a row of phones was called @entity102			0
@entity7 announced three new devices at @entity2 : a portable wireless hotspot , an @entity98 phone made from recycled materials , and the @entity107 from @entity108 and @entity109			1
@entity7 's new @entity27 network is expected to match its older , slower 4g network by the end of this year , @entity110 , the carrier 's network operations president , said in an interview			1
the company will stop selling devices that support its old @entity22 around that same time , and it will turn off access to that network in 2015			0
" the ecosystem is going to be larger in @entity27 , " @entity110 said			0
not only will it be larger , but this @entity22 is likely to remain king for some time .			0

a new data network , called @entity27 , took hold at @entity2
the technology will exceed old 4g networks
old 4g phones from @entity6 and @entity7 are not *compatible* with it
