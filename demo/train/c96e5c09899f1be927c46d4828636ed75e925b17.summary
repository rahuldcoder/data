there are photos of bodies with limbs torn from their sockets and others showing people with their eyes gouged out -- even shots of people being crucified			2
but with crises in the @entity12 and eastern @entity13 , does the world still care about @entity14 , one of the deadliest conflicts in history ? the opposition @entity18 reported 1,600 deaths in just 10 days in july and more than 115,000 people killed since the beginning of the uprising against president @entity24 's regime in march 2011			1
a spokesman for the @entity27 secretary - general said officials have had issues getting reliable numbers but may have updated figures this month			2
" the @entity27 may stop crunching the numbers , but the people who are being killed still count , " said @entity32 , senior adviser to a @entity34 - based @entity14 opposition coalition			1
there are reports of militants crucifying people in public and images smuggled out of @entity14 that appear to show them raising their victims ' severed heads on poles			1
those gut - wrenching photos come from a man known only as " @entity48 , " who testified before the @entity50 on july 31			0
@entity48 described himself as a @entity14 military defector tasked by @entity24 's regime with taking photos of killed detainees			1
he said he smuggled about 50,000 photos of those bodies out of the war - torn country			0
the @entity59 said the images of brutalized bodies were " suggestive of torture and killing on an industrial scale by the @entity24 regime			2
" committee chairman rep. @entity65 , @entity66 , and ranking @entity67 rep. @entity67 of @entity68 said they were floored by the photos			0
" we want to look away			0
but we must not , " @entity67 said			0
" we will never forget the @entity14 people , " @entity65 said			1
but advocates argue that we 've already forgotten			2
@entity32 said that if the international community does n't pay attention to what is happening in @entity14 , it is letting both @entity24 's regime and the @entity79 -- formerly known as @entity80 -- get away with crimes against humanity			1
the @entity79 has taken over several cities as it seeks to create an @entity85 caliphate that encompasses parts of @entity87 and @entity14			1
" there is a real concern that the daily slaughter being perpetuated by the @entity24 regime has suddenly become accepted by the international community as the new normal , " @entity32 said			0
the conflict continues to spread throughout the country , threatening to spill over its borders			0
on july 28 , a fuel depot in @entity97 , the capitol of @entity98 , was set ablaze during fighting between two rebel groups			0
the fire continued to burn out of control aafter firefighters were forced to abandon attempts to extinguish the blaze as conflict over the nearby airport intensified			0
sunday , at least eight @entity109 soldiers were killed and an additional 20 were wounded amid clashes with insurgents who crossed the border from @entity14 into @entity109 , according to @entity109 's official @entity113			1
@entity115 attorney general @entity114 said in july that @entity115 need to take the threat of the @entity79 seriously , voicing concerns that the group 's impact could reach the @entity120			1
how did so many in the international community let the nearly 3Â½ - year struggle in @entity14 slip from the front of their minds ? @entity126 of the @entity128 journalism school says it could be because there 's a lot going on in the world right now			1
" there are half a dozen big international stories going at the same time , " @entity126 said			0
" the biggest are what 's going on with @entity137 and @entity138 , then you 've got airplanes being shot out of the sky in @entity13			0
the @entity14 story has been going on and on and on			1
" but just because a story is forgotten does not mean it 's less important , @entity126 argued			0
this disappointed one of the @entity27 's own groups , an internal commission headed up by @entity148 that has been looking into human rights violations in @entity14			1
" what we are insisting is that if accountability is not dealt in this conflict , this is disrespect for the victims , for the civilian population that are paying the brunt of this conflict , " @entity148 said			0
in may , the @entity160 vetoed a referral to the @entity162 , which could have been a first step in bringing those responsible for human rights violations in @entity14 to justice			1
attention is slowly starting to shift back to @entity14			1
after @entity148 's group 's testimony last week , the @entity160 condemned getting oil from " terrorist groups " from @entity14 and @entity87 and said it believed that money from these sales fueled the strengthening of the @entity79			2
the @entity160 also authorized shipment of humanitarian aid into @entity14 without its government 's approval			2
@entity115 secretary of state @entity179 announced last week that the @entity115 is giving an additional $ 378 million to help bolster aid for @entity14			1
@entity126 said that seeing people like @entity48 come forward with pictures to put a face on the suffering has helped bring the story back to life			0
" a story without photographs is a story that gets lost , " @entity126 said			0
" as long as there is an image to keep that narrative moving , you stay on the front page			0
" five reasons the @entity120 should worry about @entity14 and @entity87 news overload pushes aside @entity98 , @entity14 , @entity196 , @entity197			2
