-- @entity4 secretary @entity3 ' directive overruling the @entity6 's decision to make emergency contraception available over the counter for all women , including girls under 17 , was not only unprecedented , it was substantively without merit			1
after a thorough and months - long review of the evidence , the @entity6 's @entity12 determined that the contraceptive , @entity17 one - step , was safe and effective for teens , and that teens on their own understood what the product did -- and did n't do -- and how to use it			1
based on these expert findings , the @entity6 commissioner , @entity23 , concluded that @entity17 one - step was " safe and effective and should be approved for nonprescription use for all females of childbearing potential			2
" the @entity6 decision overruled by @entity3 would have made emergency contraception available , alongside condoms and pregnancy tests , on the shelves of pharmacies , grocery stores and other retailers , giving women of all ages at risk of unintended pregnancy timely access to this safe and effective backup contraceptive method			1
and time is of the essence here : although @entity17 can help prevent pregnancy for up to three days after intercourse , it is more effective the sooner it is taken			0
plan - b contraceptive pill will stay prescription - only for girls under 17 @entity51 's concurrence with the recommendation to make the emergency contraceptive available over the counter was in line with the positions taken by the nation 's most prestigious medical , scientific and public health organizations			2
the only groups opposing the @entity6 's decision were self - styled " pro-family " groups that oppose emergency contraception -- and most other methods of modern contraception -- outright			2
@entity3 , who is not a scientist and who offered no evidence to contradict the @entity6 's conclusions , said she based her decision on her personal belief that adolescents as young as 11 might not understand how to use emergency contraception without guidance from a health care professional			1
to invoke 11 - year - olds was not only inflammatory , but diversionary			0
fewer than 1 % of 11 - year - old girls have had sexual intercourse , but close to half of girls -- most beginning at 15 or 16 -- have had sex by their 17th birthday			1
under @entity3 ' ruling , girls under 17 will be unable to obtain emergency contraception without a doctor 's prescription			1
and if , as @entity3 insists , younger teens are unable to understand the label on this product -- which the evidence suggests they can -- it follows that they also would n't understand the labels on countless other over-the - counter medications that can have severe , even fatal , side - effects if misused -- which this product does not			1
restricting access to safe and effective contraceptive methods will only increase the number of women , teens and older women alike , who will have to face an unintended pregnancy			0
half of all pregnancies in the @entity108 -- and 82 % of teen pregnancies -- are unplanned			1
the @entity108 already has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy in the developed world			0
unintended pregnancy is not just a statistic ; it has real consequences			0
on an individual level , it results in women either having an abortion or an unplanned birth			0
and it harms the body politic by perpetuating a seemingly endless and unquestionably divisive national abortion debate			0
the entirely science - based decision by the @entity6 to make emergency contraception more easily available was a chance to take an important step forward for women and for our society			2
instead we 've taken a huge step back			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0

@entity135 : secretary @entity3 ' overrule of @entity6 on emergency contraception *wrong*
she says @entity6 study was thorough , found over-the - counter sale of @entity17 safe
she says @entity3 *incorrectly* invoked girls of 11 using it ; less than 1 % have intercourse
camp : half of @entity108 pregnancies ( and 82 % of teens ) are unplanned . ruling a step back
