-- @entity1 was a corpulent " @entity3 " veteran like @entity2			1
he died of a drug overdose like @entity2 ( at the same age , no less )			2
@entity3 alum @entity1 backstage at the 1997 @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
and now , with " the @entity3 , " he gets his own biographical treatment just like -- you guessed it -- @entity2			2
the " oral history " form of presentation -- essentially a string of anecdotes from friends and family -- is popular in the " @entity3 " canon			2
( see @entity21 's 1984 @entity20 bio , " @entity22 , " and 2002 's " @entity23			0
" ) it 's no wonder : everyone involved -- @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 -- are terrific storytellers			2
in exacting detail , @entity31 and @entity1 's brother @entity32 dutifully trace the comedian 's life from his wealthy upbringing in @entity37 , @entity38 , to his improv days in @entity39 at the @entity41 and @entity42 theaters to his five semi-distinguished years on " @entity3 " and beyond			1
as with any good oral history , " the @entity3 " moves briskly and the reporting is deep			0
( the most notable omission from the celeb - packed tome is snl peer @entity48			0
) @entity1 's own physicality is a good metaphor for the book : the meal is overstuffed with gossip and dish , whether it 's @entity27 lamenting a fallout with @entity1 over a girl ( it was never truly repaired ) or @entity58 scolding @entity1 's famed @entity60 sketch with @entity61			1
" there 's no comic twist to it , " explains @entity25			0
" it 's just f --- ing mean			0
a more mentally together @entity1 would n't have done it			1
" @entity1 does n't come off as particularly likable -- hookers , drug addiction , and his deepest insecurities are on full display			1
still , he ultimately emerges as more than just a sweaty beast who gave good pratfall			1
here 's a guy who lived to please his 600 - pound alcoholic father ( wonder where those demons came from ? )			2
beneath the unhealthy physique was an almost graceful athlete			0
he was a deeply religious man who attended catholic mass twice a week			0
but for all of the candor , @entity1 makes a little too much of its subject 's talent			1
the second - coming - of - @entity20 proclamations flow endlessly ; at one point , @entity1 is even compared to @entity86			1
his first film , 1995 's " @entity88 , " is dubbed a " minor classic			0
if the other @entity6 nominees are " @entity91 " and " @entity92			0
" it 's actually @entity94 who , while blasting @entity1 over his narcotics addiction , puts his legacy in proper perspective : " look , you 're not @entity2			1
and when you overdose or kill yourself , you will not have the same acclaim that @entity2 did			0
you do n't have the record of accomplishment that he had			0
in fact , this unflinching , well - written book outshines any @entity1 highlight reel			1
