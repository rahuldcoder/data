so why is the dressing named after an archipelago ? no one 's quite sure			1
some people claim that early film star and vaudevillian @entity42 , who summered on the @entity26 , named it , while others contend that @entity46 , the famed proprietor of the @entity47 , gave the dressing its name because of his own summer place in the region			1
no matter who named it , it 's tough to beat on a sandwich			1
ranch dressing @entity57 , the beloved dressing and dipping sauce actually got its start on a real ranch			2
when @entity63 and @entity64 opened a dude ranch in @entity66 in 1954 , they had an ace up their sleeves : a delicious dressing that @entity63 had concocted while the couple was living in @entity71			2
the couple did a nice business at their @entity74 , but guests were always flipping out over just how tasty @entity63 's dressing was			1
eventually , the @entity78 started bottling the stuff , and the popularity grew so quickly that they had to hire a twelve - man crew just to help mix up each batch			0
@entity63 's culinary creativity turned out to be lucrative ; in 1972 @entity84 forked over $ 8 million for the recipe			2
@entity0 : foods named after people 3			2

@entity95 allegedly took one bite of @entity92 's creation and declared that it was " @entity88			2
" brand then left the king 's employ in order to go peddle his new sauce			2
@entity109 @entity109 is perhaps the most famous of all hot sauces , but where did it get its name ? when @entity114 , a former banker , invented the sauce in @entity116 in 1868 , he did n't have a huge supply of chili peppers at his disposal			1

@entity130 legend has it that @entity130 takes its name from @entity135 's company formerly marketing 57 products at once , and except for the number , the story holds up			2
@entity135 's web site tells a story that @entity141 was riding a train when he saw a billboard advertising 21 varieties of shoes			0
he so liked the idea he wanted to try it with his own condiment company			0
thus , he started touting @entity135 's 57 varieties			0
there was only one catch : @entity135 marketed well over 60 products at the time			0
so where did the 57 come from ? @entity141 thought the number was lucky			0
five was @entity135 's lucky number , and seven was his wife 's			0
he mashed the charmed digits together , got 57 , and never looked back			0
@entity157 fish 's best friend is named after an alternate spelling of the word " @entity167 , " which was how western @entity162 once referred to almost anyone of @entity165 or @entity166 descent			1

one of the dishes they left behind , beef tartare , came back into fashion in 19th - century @entity176			0

@entity186 @entity186 , the lemon - butter - and - egg yumminess that @entity188 ca n't live without , is n't actually @entity189			1
instead , it 's one of the most well known @entity192 sauces			1
the sauce first appeared in @entity192 cooking in the 17th century , and is apparently named both because it somewhat resembles an old @entity189 sauce and because the @entity189 had such thriving butter and egg industries that provided two of the sauce 's main ingredients			1
