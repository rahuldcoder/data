a wave of bombings came amid @entity9 festivities marking the end of the holy month of @entity11			2
it followed a july that was the bloodiest in five years , when violence between @entity15 and @entity16 -- both @entity18 sects -- spun out of control			1
in a press release saturday , the @entity20 said the attacks " bear the hallmarks of suicide and vehicle attacks in @entity4 over the past ninety days " and said most of those attacks were committed by @entity23 in @entity4 , which is led by @entity24			2
" the @entity31 has offered a $ 10 million reward for information that helps authorities kill or capture @entity24 , " the @entity20 said , referring to a reward that the @entity31 embassy in @entity32 says has existed since 2011			1
" this reward is second only to information leading to @entity37 , the chief of @entity23 's network , and symbolizes our ongoing commitment to helping our partners in the region eliminate this threat from their territory			0
" the @entity45 , an umbrella group that includes @entity23 in @entity4 , claimed responsibility for saturday 's attacks on sunday			2
