two of those have been released from a hospital , said @entity62 , a @entity27 provincial government spokesman			0
at the minimum , @entity23 would be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole if he 's convicted on even one of the 17 murder charges , according to a statement from the @entity72 public affairs office			1
at the maximum , he could face the death penalty			1
prosecutors could levy more charges " as they see fit , " said a defense official with knowledge of the charges preferred			0
" the @entity5 investigators are still working , " the official said			0
" there is no requirement to ' lock in ' to certain charges at this point			0
" stunned friends recall good deeds of suspect the @entity92 , in an e-mail friday to @entity1 , vowed " strong revenge " for the attacks and claimed justice wo n't be served in @entity3 courts , which they said " are not reliable			1
" the @entity98 fundamentalist group , which been battling coalition and @entity12 government forces for years , believes that " tens of @entity3 soldiers , and not one person " are responsible for the killings , according to the message			1
" we do n't believe in these ( @entity3 ) courts and reject the decision , " the @entity92 said			1
" we will take practical revenge on every single @entity3 soldier			1
" @entity23 , who was returned to the @entity3 last week , is being held at @entity109 , @entity110			1
speaking from @entity112 in @entity0 , where @entity23 is assigned , @entity5 gen. @entity111 called the developments friday -- in which @entity3 military lawyers in @entity72 " preferred " the charges -- " the first step in a long process that 's going to occur			1
" the case is now in the hands of the special convening authority , col. @entity123 from the @entity119			0
as a @entity125 unit leader who is still at @entity112 , @entity123 handles courts - martial issues regarding @entity125 members , according to base spokesman @entity128			0
@entity23 ' case could go straight to an @entity130 -- a military hybrid of a civilian preliminary hearing and a grand jury session that @entity111 , the @entity5 's vice chief of staff , acknowledged has " challenges associated with it			1
" or @entity23 could go before a group of mental health experts who would determine whether his mental health may be a factor in his defense			1
@entity142 , a military defense lawyer , told @entity1 on friday that he expected " the mental status of ... @entity23 will be the overriding factor in this case " -- including both his state of mind at the time of the attack , as well as whether he 's mentally competent to stand trial			1
eventually , after gathering prosecution and defense testimony , @entity123 will recommend what charges should be pursued to a higher - ranking general convening authority , in this case maj. gen. @entity156			1
as deputy commanding general for @entity125 , @entity156 is taking on this duty while the corps ' commanding general , lt. gen. @entity160 , is deployed , @entity128 said			0
@entity156 is expected to offer his own recommendation on whether the case should go to trial and , if so , on what charges and whether a death penalty should be a possible sentence			1
if and when the case comes to trial , @entity23 ' lawyer , @entity168 , said , it is going to be " extremely difficult " for the prosecution			2
" they have no murder scene , no forensics , " the lawyer said thursday night outside his @entity174 office			0
" i 'm going to make them prove every claim			0
" prosecution faces major hurdles military law experts acknowledge that proving the case may be difficult , especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in part because those killed were buried quickly , in accordance with @entity98 tradition -- and difficulty in getting witnesses to testify			2
@entity12 are insisting that the suspect be returned to @entity72 to face trial , with villagers and lawmakers questioning the @entity3 military 's account of what happened			2
but a military official in @entity72 has said that @entity23 will be tried in the @entity3			1
@entity34 , the @entity35 spokesman , said that defense attorneys would need coalition forces ' protection if they choose to investigate in @entity72			0
he notes that the @entity92 " has already taken some potshots at @entity12 investigators that went to the area			2
" still , @entity34 said witnesses may not necessarily have to fly to the @entity3 to testify as they could speak via teleconference			2
and @entity212 , a former @entity213 lawyer and current @entity215 professor , told @entity1 that any bullet rounds recovered from the scene could be matched with @entity23 ' weapon -- assuming it was " immediately seized " -- which would serve as " powerful evidence for the government			2
" suspect has memory loss , lawyer says @entity225 , the lawyer for @entity23 ' wife , @entity226 , said @entity23 did not surrender to @entity3 authorities , as some have reported			1
rather , @entity225 said , @entity23 was taken into custody , though he was n't sure why			2
asked about @entity23 ' state of mind , @entity230 said on " @entity232 " on friday that his client has n't said much in their meetings and appears to have memory problems predating the incident			2
" he has some memories about what happened before the alleged event and some memories after the alleged event and some windows here and there into things , but he really does n't have any memory , " @entity230 said			0
" he 's kind of in shock			0
" @entity23 told his wife , in the first of two phone conversations they had since he was detained , that something had happened and he did n't know what it was , according to @entity225			2
what 's the link between violence and disorders ? @entity230 told @entity232 that " the @entity261 , " the acclaimed 2008 film about a bomb disposal unit in the @entity265 war , is a " @entity266 movie compared to what these guys are going through			0
" " just seeing people blown apart ... picking up body parts , putting them in bags , " he said			0
" you know , a lot of servicemen go through that and do n't have incidents alleged like this , but it 's pretty horrific			0
we do know he had a concussive head injury , which is serious			0
we also know it was not treated for a variety of reasons			0
" @entity12 villagers describe massacre 's horror another member of @entity23 ' defense team , @entity290 , said friday that she 'd spoken recently with @entity23 , and he is " holding up			2
" " he 's concerned about the welfare of his family , first and foremost , and the safety of the people who are on the ground in @entity72 , " @entity290 said of the father of two			0
the massacre has strained already tense @entity3 - @entity12 relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull @entity3 troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal			2
@entity12 president @entity302 has demanded that troops withdraw from villages in his nation and return to their larger bases , saying relations between the two countries are " at the end of their rope			0
" @entity302 urges @entity3 pullback after massacre @entity1 legal contributor and defense attorney @entity313 said on @entity1 's " @entity315 " that he believes prosecutors will seek the death penalty against @entity23 " because this is one of the biggest alleged massacres in memory			1
" " you have the diplomatic and political problems that are being caused by this crime , " @entity313 said			0
" @entity12 citizens will be looking , saying , ' is the @entity3 seeking justice in this case ? ' " but he said that even if prosecutors won a death sentence , it is unlikely that @entity23 would be executed for years , if not decades			1
suspect held liable for financial fraud accounts from the military , @entity23 ' family , friends and neighbors describe a man who remained committed to serving his country despite wounds he received during three previous combat tours to @entity265 , including a traumatic brain injury suffered during a vehicle accident			2
but @entity344 , a former @entity5 captain , said the speculation about whether his injuries or a possible undiagnosed case of post-traumatic stress disorder contributed to @entity23 ' actions is unfair to other veterans			0
" sgt. @entity23 has been through a lot as a soldier			1
many of us have , " @entity344 said			0
" that is certainly no explanation or excuse for the gross violation of his code of honor , to say the least , and the horrific crimes that he committed			0
" @entity1 's @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 and @entity368 contributed to this report .			0
