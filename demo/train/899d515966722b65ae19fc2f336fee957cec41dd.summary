-- the much - touted july 2011 date for the beginning of a withdrawal of @entity5 combat troops from @entity6 , a center piece of the administration 's " @entity11 " strategy announced by president @entity10 in december 2009 , now seems unlikely to amount to much			1
according to a senior @entity5 administration official , there is presently " no judgment on the scale or pace of those reductions			2
" translation : do n't expect a significant drawdown of @entity5 forces in the summer of 2011			2
indeed , there has been a strategic shift in the @entity10 administration policy towards @entity6 -- first apparent at the @entity25 conference of @entity27 members in november			1
the headline is that the @entity5 will maintain combat troops in @entity6 until december 2014			1
and @entity27 will continue to have some kind of role in @entity6 , likely advising and training units of the @entity6 army , into 2015 and beyond			1
this shift does n't seem to have registered much as yet with the @entity5 people , a record 60 % of whom are now opposed to the @entity38 , according to a @entity40 poll			2
indeed , in his brief remarks on thursday about the @entity6 - @entity44 strategy review , the president did not mention the fact that @entity5 troops will remain in @entity6 until the end of 2014 , likely in substantial numbers			1
according to a wide range of @entity5 military and civilian officials and @entity6 politicians interviewed in @entity6 over the past few days , the 2014 withdrawal date is a potential game - changer , allowing time for the build - up of a more effective @entity6 army , while disappointing @entity58 leaders who had been assuring their fighters that the @entity5 would be withdrawing in mid- 2011			1
the 2014 date also signals to the @entity44 that the @entity5 commitment to @entity6 is a long - term one and they might as well end their tolerance or support for the @entity58 and its allies headquartered on their territory			1
the good news in the review for the @entity5 government is that parts of the @entity58 heartland in central @entity72 and @entity73 province have been reclaimed from the insurgents			0
one @entity5 official says that a surge of @entity78 raids against the @entity58 have been devastating to the " middle management " of the group and " literally hundreds have been taken off the battlefield			0
" the calculus is that the more pressure that is placed on the @entity58 militarily the more that they might consider suing for peace			0
however , the @entity58 leadership has repeatedly and publicly said that they are not in any form of peace negotiations with the @entity6 government and there is n't evidence that contradicts this			0
further positive news in the review is that @entity96 , where around 15 % of the @entity6 population lives , is safer than for a very long time			0
a @entity5 official points out that in past months " @entity96 has been remarkably quiet			0
" certainly , @entity96 's streets are more clogged with traffic than ever and @entity96 residents say they feel safer			0
the @entity102 also asserts that " @entity104 's senior leadership in @entity44 is weaker and under more sustained pressure than at any other point since it fled @entity6 in 2001			0
" that point is borne out by a count by the @entity108 of reported @entity5 drone strikes in @entity44 which found that five @entity104 leaders were killed by drones in 2010 and six the year before			0
another positive development the administration cites is that the @entity114 is growing rapidly , and has met its recruitment goals three months earlier than expected			0
at the @entity96 base that trains around half of the @entity6 army recruits , @entity6 officers said last week that they are churning out 2,800 graduates a month			1
that said , it 's not possible to think of a single significant operation the @entity6 army has conducted without @entity5 support			1
the bad news according to administration officials is that while the @entity44 military has been aggressive against @entity104 and @entity44 @entity58 groups that have attacked the @entity44 state , no action has been taken against other militant groups based in @entity44 such as the @entity134 shura , which is headed by @entity58 leader @entity135 , and coordinates attacks against @entity5 and @entity27 forces in southern @entity6			1
nor has there been any action taken against the @entity140 , which is behind most of the attacks on coalition forces in eastern @entity6 , nor against two smaller @entity44 - based @entity58 militias : @entity144 and one led by @entity145			0
indeed , an administration official says " some of the evidence swings the other way -- active support and at least tolerance " by the @entity44 for a number of the @entity58 factions			0
this is the paradox of @entity44 , which a @entity5 official characterizes as " both our closest counterterrorism partner and a base for terrorist groups that threaten the region and even the homeland			0
" administration officials explain that in " coming months " the @entity5 will negotiate with the @entity6 government to extend @entity5 commitments to @entity6 well beyond 2014			1
that commitment could take the minimalist form of a simple political statement that the @entity5 will be in @entity6 for the long term , or it could take a maximalist form -- a defense treaty on the model of the one the @entity5 has with @entity171 , a model that is frequently cited admiringly by @entity6 officials			2
or it could be something in between those positions , such as a @entity176 of the kind that the @entity5 signed with @entity178 in 2008 , which is legally binding but does not require the two - thirds majority in the @entity180 that is necessary for the ratification of a full - blown treaty			2
that agreement allowed @entity5 forces to remain in @entity178 in an advisory role but not in combat operations			2
a @entity5 official says that such a long - term pact will " speak to the @entity6 , speak to the @entity44 and indirectly to the @entity58 : you ca n't wait us out here			2
" whatever form this new commitment takes , it 's obvious that the @entity10 administration is in @entity6 for the long haul .			1

@entity197 says there has been a strategic shift in the @entity10 administration policy towards @entity6
@entity5 will maintain combat troops in @entity6 until december 2014
@entity27 will continue to have some kind of role in @entity6 , likely advising and training units of the @entity6 army , into 2015 and beyond .
