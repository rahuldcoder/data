@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's @entity0 home is contaminated with radiation and filled with the nightmares of his wife 's horrific suicide			1
" i can still see it , " says the 62 - year old , the tears welling in his eyes			2
what he sees is @entity14 , his wife of 39 years , on fire and scorched			2
the 58 - year - old doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire last july after slipping into an overwhelming depression			2
as evacuees from last year 's @entity0 nuclear disaster , @entity4 and @entity14 lost everything : their home , their jobs , and any hope for the future			1
" if there was no nuclear accident , we would n't have gone through this terrible thing , " he says			2
" this is @entity32 's fault			2
" @entity32 , or the @entity32 , owns the @entity0 nuclear plant			1
the triple nuclear meltdown at the plant spewed radiation across a wide swath of @entity0 prefecture , forcing the mandatory evacuation of 70,000 residents and a second tier evacuation of an additional 90,000			1
the @entity42 were part of the second tier evacuation in @entity45 in @entity0 prefecture , where radiation readings top nationally acceptable levels			1
in a landmark case , @entity4 filed a lawsuit last month against @entity32 , blaming the utility company for his wife 's suicide			1
the aim of his lawsuit , he says , is to push @entity32 and the @entity1 government to stop treating the nuclear accident as if it 's a natural disaster			1
@entity4 wants @entity32 to compensate and treat victims for a man - made accident , which would expedite how the company cares for evacuees			1
evacuees like @entity4 say @entity32 is moving too slowly to restore the lives of impacted residents			1
that lack of speed , he says , is leading to social fallout like suicide			2
@entity32 , in a statement to @entity2 , said it would not comment on lawsuits filed against the company			0
@entity4 says his wife 's depression happened gradually , after they evacuated out of their home into a cramped temporary housing unit			1
when the chicken factory where they worked shut down because it was in the evacuation zone , the couple lost their jobs			1
@entity4 says his wife began to worry incessantly about how to pay off their mortgage , made worse because they had nothing to fill their days as evacuees			1
" she cried so much and repeatedly asked me to take her to our home , " he says			2
he decided to plan an overnight trip to their house in @entity45 on june 30			0
that night , the @entity42 enjoyed life as they expected to live it -- eating in their dining room and looking out at the garden			0
" we talked a lot then , " recalls @entity4			1
" i do n't quite remember what we talked about , but we shared a lot			0
" @entity4 went to bed with his wife , feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks			1
" at 1 a.m. , i woke up to use the restroom and when i went back to bed , she grabbed my arm and would n't let go			0
she was crying so hard then			0
that was the last time he would ever hear his wife 's voice			1
" the next morning , i woke up early around 4 a.m. i snuck out quietly to start clearing the brush around the house again			0
when i got to the corner of the house , i saw a fire go up at about human height			0
i did n't think too much of it at the time			0
" @entity4 continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower			1
when he could n't find his wife after about an hour , he grew concerned			2
he started to wander around his yard and remembered the fire			0
" i went there to take a look			0
then i found her , burned			0
" @entity4 says it 's strange what you remember in trauma			1
he recalls being shocked and standing frozen but he also remembers trying to put out the fire with his hands			0
but he will never forget the image of his wife 's charred and stiff body , her legs and midriff still burning , and the flies beginning to gather around her open mouth			1
this was n't supposed to happen , says @entity4			1
he and his wife met in elementary school but fell in love in their early 20s			0
they raised three children and a grandchild in their home			0
they took out a second mortgage on their home so they could renovate it for the next generation of their family			0
" we lost everything , " he says			0
" we were forced to evacuate			0
i lost my wife in such a terrible way			2
" @entity4 's lawsuit seeks to elevate his wife 's suicide beyond the horror tale whispered among evacuees			1
" @entity4 's case is very symbolic , " says his attorney @entity162			1
" @entity164 feels the same way			0
their despair and their anger that they have no foreseeable future stands behind this case			0
" @entity32 has begun decontaminating affected communities			0
across @entity0 prefecture , crews are scraping away contaminated soil , acre by acre			1
but it is painfully slow as the contaminated area is approximately 10 times the size of @entity182 's @entity181			0
due to the size of the affected area , @entity32 and the @entity1 government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return			0
" i feel an unspeakable rage , " says @entity4			2
" if i do n't do something , my wife is just another suicide case			2
