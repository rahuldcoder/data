@entity0 -- if were born in the year of the rooster , here 's something to crow about : you are in for a " ss - super " 2013			1
likewise , it 's going to be a strong year if you 're a dog or an @entity9			1
too bad , however , if you 're a @entity10			1
on sunday we say farewell to the @entity13 and welcome the @entity14			0
for the occasion , the @entity0 brokerage @entity15 has brought out its annual @entity17			1
now in its 19th year , the index is a guide to your investment decisions -- specifically how the benchmark @entity21 will perform -- over the next 12 months , based on the ancient @entity23 art ( or science , if you prefer ) of feng shui			2
if you are wondering what that entails , this report consults the experts on bazi ( fortune charts ) , wu - xing ( five - element theory ) and xuan kong ( flying stars )			0
@entity15 itself describes the report as a light - hearted exercise			1
but before anyone dismisses this as a mere marketing ploy or mystical mumbo - jumbo , take a look at last year 's forecast			1
it is a pretty close match to how the @entity43 actually performed			0
the brokerage has a team of about six people plus feng shui masters -- they wo n't say who they are -- working on the report for several months leading up to the publication			2
what do the geomancers say ? first the good news			0
it will be a good year for the @entity43 , particularly in the first half and @entity56 is flagged as a standout month			0
it 's interesting that march is also the month that the @entity59 has to deal with the debt - ceiling			0
after june the ride gets much rougher and more volatile			0
a trading opportunity perhaps ? the @entity15 index also looks at health , relationships and work for the year to come			1
if you were born in the year of the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , it is going to be a great year , says the report			1
if you are a pig , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 or @entity10 , it 's best to fast forward to 2014			1
interestingly , those with the same birth sign as the year sign invariably have bad years			2
there 's something else to keep in mind			0
the @entity10 sheds its skin , which in the @entity23 horoscope signals new ideas or developments , both good and bad			2
the depression year of 1929 was a @entity10 year , as was 1989 ( @entity86 ) and 2001 ( the 9/11 attacks )			1
in fact the past five snake years have not been very encouraging , says the report			2
but this time around it will be different because all five elements -- earth , metal , wood , water and fire -- are present			0
in the first half of the year , fire is strong and fire drives markets higher , according to the report			0
in the second half , the fire influence wanes and water starts rising , a bad sign for the markets			0
the good news is that the year ends with the index higher than the start of the year			0
the bad news is , if you are actually born a @entity10 , the year will be , in @entity15 's own words , a bit of a " hisser			1

@entity0 group @entity15 has *released* its @entity17 for 2013
it is going to be a great year for people born in the @entity118 , dogs or @entity9 ( @entity70 )
if you are a pig , @entity73 ( sheep ) , @entity75 or @entity10 , it 's best to fast forward to 2014
the past five years of the @entity10 have been marked by inauspicious events
