@entity0 , @entity1 -- police in @entity0 , @entity1 , used tear gas , plastic pellets and a water cannon friday on protesters angry over the government 's response to a coal mine fire that killed at least 298 people			1
protesters chanting " do n't sleep , @entity0 , remember your dead ! " coursed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site , trying to reach a statue honoring miners			1
the clash came two days after a photograph surfaced of an aide to @entity1 's prime minister kicking a protester , an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government , and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine			1
the complex exploded into fire for unknown reasons tuesday -- trapping many miners deep underground			2
among other issues , mine officials indicated friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have sheltered from the flames and choking fumes			1
site manager @entity42 told reporters that the mine had closed one emergency refuge when excavation work moved to a lower area			1
miners were building , but had not finished , a new safety chamber at the lower level , he said			0
the owner of the company , @entity52 , said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in @entity1			1
the company , he said , had no legal obligation to build safety chambers			0
early satuday , the @entity59 and @entity60 said the number of dead in the mining disaster is now 298			1
it was n't immediately clear how many miners may still be inside ; authorities earlier said 18 remained trapped			0
if and when they are found , hopes have dwindled that they 'll be alive			0
rescue workers have n't found anyone alive since wednesday			0
smoke and fumes were still hindering search and recovery efforts friday , officials said			2
authorities have previously said the fire was sparked by a transformer explosion , but @entity42 told reporters friday that the cause of the fire was still unknown			2
asked what had happened , he said , " we do n't know either			0
never seen anything like this before			0
we are trying to find out			0
" kicking a protester friday 's clashes are likely to further anger @entity0 residents already seething over the disaster and the treatment of the protester kicked by @entity91 , an adviser to prime minister @entity92			1
the man , detained by special forces , can be seen lying on the ground as the suited adviser to @entity92 appears to aim a kick at him			0
the shocking image outraged many in @entity1 , prompting an outpouring of anger on social media , and is seen as symbolizing the increasingly polarizing impact of @entity92 's authority in the country			1
@entity91 was quoted by @entity1 's semiofficial @entity107 news agency thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day 's events			1
" i am sad that i could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation , insults and attacks that i was subjected to that day , " he reportedly said			0
in another incident wednesday , video footage showed a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing @entity92			0
as the prime minister entered the crowded store , he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner			0
after the confrontation , the video captured what appeared to be @entity92 's security guards beating the same man to the floor			2
the miner said later that @entity92 slapped him , possibly by mistake			0
he wants an apology for the way he was treated by the prime minister 's staff			2
@entity136 , a spokesman for the ruling @entity137 , or @entity137 , dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of @entity91 kicking the protester was misleading			1
political bonfire besides the anger prompted by the photo , @entity92 's comments wednesday to relatives of dead and injured miners were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism			1
the prime minister glossed over the issue of mine safety , describing the carnage that was suffered as par for the course in the dangerous business			2
as public anger mounted through the evening , hundreds took to the streets in anti-government protests in @entity159 and @entity160 , with police answering , in some cases , with water cannons and tear gas			0
as @entity92 took a stroll through the city , onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of " resign , prime minister ! " @entity1 foreign minister @entity171 defended @entity92 in an interview with @entity2 's @entity173 on thursday			1
" he was feeling all these pains in his heart , " he said			0
" everybody knows that our prime minister is always with the people , and always feels the pain of the people			0
otherwise , he would n't get such a high support in eight elections in ( the ) last 10 years			0
" but the disaster opened up an old political wound			2
opposition politician @entity186 from the @entity188 region , which includes @entity0 , filed a proposal in late april to investigate @entity1 mines after repeated deadly accidents			1
@entity92 's government rejected the proposal			2
it claimed that the mine , owned by @entity196 , had passed recent inspections			2
a @entity1 engineers ' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment this week as being " insufficient and old			1
" a lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years , according to @entity1 's @entity205			1
a ' sorrow for the whole @entity1 nation ' president @entity210 offered words of comfort as he visited @entity0 on thursday , the day after his premier attracted public ire			1
the disaster is a " sorrow for the whole @entity1 nation , " @entity210 told reporters , and he offered his condolences to the victims ' families			1
an investigation has begun , @entity210 said , adding that he was sure this would " shed light " on what regulations are needed			0
" whatever is necessary will be done , " he said			0
despair , anger , dwindling hope after @entity1 coal mine fire @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 reported from western @entity1 , and @entity233 wrote and reported from @entity234			1
@entity2 's @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
