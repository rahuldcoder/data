the race stewards have also referred the incident to the @entity23 for further consideration , the official @entity11 website reported			2
@entity2 , who started second on the grid behind @entity26 , recovered after being overtaken at the beginning by @entity18 , who held off his surging teammate until the 49th lap of 67			1
then he appeared to let the @entity30 through after being told on his radio that he was the slower of the two drivers			2
@entity18 's race engineer @entity33 told him : " @entity2 is faster than you			1
can you confirm you understand ? " then when @entity2 went through , @entity33 added : " good lad -- just stick with it now , sorry			2

@entity2 , who also won in @entity46 , stayed in fifth place but closed to within 34 points of leader @entity49 with eight races left			0

@entity11 championship standings after @entity54 @entity18 held on for second place for his best result of the season since @entity46 , with @entity59 third and teammate @entity60 sixth as @entity61 failed to follow up the latter 's victory last time out at @entity65			1
the race came a year to the day after @entity18 suffered a horrific head injury after an accident in qualifying for the @entity69 @entity5 which ruled him out for the rest of the season			1
after the race , he refused to criticize his team about the incident but looked visibly disappointed and would not elaborate on how he felt about the events -- while @entity1 denied that rules had been broken			1

@entity61 team principal @entity93 said he believed @entity1 had broken the rules			2

@entity18 did the better job			0
he was in the lead and the regulations are pretty clear -- team orders are not allowed , " he told @entity98 race broadcaster the @entity99 before the fine was announced			2
" i have to say that is the clearest team order i 've ever seen			0
it will be interesting to see what the stewards make of it because for me it was as clear as 2002 , which is why the rule was brought in			0
it 's wrong for the sport			0
" in 2002 , @entity1 told @entity115 to let @entity77 pass in the closing stages of the @entity117 @entity5			1
but @entity77 , who finished ninth on his return to a race he has won four times , said he believed his former team made the right move			0
" i understand 100 percent and i would do exactly the same -- what are we here for ? we 're fighting for the championship , " the 41 - year - old said			0
@entity129 's @entity128 claimed seventh place at @entity54 , but it was a disappointing day for @entity131 on the @entity6 team 's home track as @entity134 was eighth ahead of seven - time world champion @entity77			1
