-- as the fallout from the botched launch of @entity5 's exchanges continues , it grows ever clearer that website glitches are only a small part of the problem with the cumbersome -- and increasingly unworkable -- law			1
one has to ask : is president @entity10 making this up as he goes ? it 's hard to imagine that the president and the team charged with implementing @entity5 could n't have foreseen the problems that have continually popped up			1
yet , here we are , bringing in " tech surges " to examine the website problems , security experts to mitigate privacy concerns , insurance executives to " brainstorm " ways to actually insure people			1
and all the while the president has implied he was the last to know that storm clouds were on the immediate horizon			0
there are two possible scenarios here : one , the president is lying , and quite effectively			2
if he knew that the website would n't be up to snuff , or that millions of @entity34 would not , in fact , be able to keep their insurance plans if they liked them , then he simply made a calculation that many politicians make : lies are n't necessarily fatal			1
just ask @entity41 " i 'm not a crook " @entity43 , @entity45 " read my lips " @entity46 , or @entity46			0
or two , @entity10 is hopelessly out of the loop			1
whether it was the @entity51 scandal , the @entity53 spying program or these @entity5 collapses , no one in his immediate circle appears to have felt it necessary to inform the president of looming problems that he might have to answer for , let alone solve			2
if i were a @entity57 like rep. @entity58 , @entity59 - @entity60 , who recently told the @entity61 , " saying you 're sorry does n't help me worth a damn at the polls , " i might be hoping it 's the former			0
politicians who lie are hardly exotic			0
chicanery is often merely the price of successful political salesmanship			0
incompetence , on the other hand , is far more damaging to the @entity71 brand			1
whereas the left and much of the narrative in the popular culture have already written @entity75 off as impolitic and inept , liberals , on the other hand , assert their intellectual superiority and tout their " willingness to govern " and get things done as party mantra			0
not only is the left smarter and more sophisticated , they insist , they 're also supposed to prove that government can solve problems			1
more pointedly , that big , unwieldy bureaucracies like the @entity87 and the @entity51 can solve massive problems , like healthcare			2
whether he was uninformed of or simply incurious about the potential failures , @entity10 's lack of preparedness and competence in implementing his signature piece of legislation not only diminishes his credibility as a problem - solver , but it jeopardizes the faith in government that liberals rely on			1
when government looks hapless , private - sector innovators are empowered and emboldened			0
for liberals , that 's bad for business			0
better they hope he was merely being dishonest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity109 .			2

@entity109 : repeated *snafus* in health exchange **rollout*s* make it seem @entity10 's playing it by ear
@entity117 : he 's either lying about not knowing exchange website not ready , or he 's incompetent
she says lying would be better it 's politically *survivable* . incompetence is more damaging
@entity117 : dems tout ability to make government solve problems . botched *rollout* hurts their brand
