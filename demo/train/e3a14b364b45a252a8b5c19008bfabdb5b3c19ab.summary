-- both parties have received an electoral politics wake - up call , courtesy of a diversifying @entity4			1
president @entity5 won re-election thanks in part to a 52 - percentage - point spread among @entity9 voters , the nation 's fastest - growing electorate , according to election eve polling			0
in the @entity4 coming over the horizon , it is practically impossible to overcome such a number and win the race for president			2
according to the polling by @entity21 , @entity9 voters nationally and across every battleground state swung heavily to @entity22			1
and it was n't even close			0
nationwide , the margin was 75 % to 23 %			0
and there were remarkable spreads in the tightest of swing states : 87 % to 10 % in @entity29 , 82 % to 17 % in @entity30 , 66 % to 31 % in @entity31			0
( @entity0 's own poll showed a smaller but still significant spread nationwide -- 71 % to 21 % -- and in the swing states )			0
even in @entity39 , with its large , @entity38 - leaning @entity37 population , the @entity21 poll found that @entity40 overall favored the president 58 % to 40 %			1
while these trends worked to @entity22 ' advantage on the ground on tuesday , that 's not entirely good news : a demographically challenged @entity38 is bad for @entity4			1
as a nation , we are at our best when both parties work together to address difficult policy issues			2
and , in the case of immigration -- an issue of great concern to @entity40 -- a bipartisan roadmap is good politics and great policy			1
bringing the country together around a common - sense immigration process is not a bridge too far			1
in fact , while partisan politics dominated the national debate , faith , law enforcement and business leaders have worked with immigrant leaders across the political spectrum to forge a new consensus on immigrants and @entity4			1
people who hold a @entity74 want change			0
" @entity84 can agree on basic values to guide our decisions and help heal our land , " @entity75 , president of @entity76 , a @entity9 faith - based aid organization , said in a recent radio ad -- in which he shared air time with @entity81 , president of the @entity83 's @entity82			0
it 's not every day that the leader of one of the nation 's largest @entity9 evangelical networks stands shoulder to shoulder with a @entity83 and presents a unified message			0
people who wear a badge also want reform			2
at a recent @entity102 summit on immigration , @entity104 , @entity100 sheriff @entity99 said , " we do n't need higher deportation levels ; we need to fix the system as it exists			0
" and job creators , people who own businesses , are yearning for common - sense reforms too			2
we know we need to find a solution when @entity116 , president of the @entity118 @entity117 , says , " the longer national political leaders ignore the issue or use it as a political wedge , the more our farmers suffer because they can not find a sufficient labor pool to harvest their crops			0
" post-election talk will focus on the president 's mandate			0
immigration is different from other issues because the mandate for reform is clear , and it 's not only because of his vote margin among @entity40			1
" immigration is the most important thing to focus on if you 're concerned about @entity4 as an economic power			1
it 's not only good policy to have more immigrants to the @entity4 ... ( and ) a path forward for those people who are here ; it 's also good politics			1
" that 's @entity142 , president of @entity143 , who added , " hostility to immigrants is a vote - losing , not a vote - winning , issue			0
" when it comes to crafting a 21st century immigration process , @entity151 , badges and business are ready to work with both @entity22 and @entity38 to reach a consensus			1
@entity4 are ready for a just immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect			1
our leaders in @entity159 -- of both parties -- can and must deliver			2
as we saw tuesday , their electability may depend on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			2

he says @entity40 heavily favored @entity22 , but an out - of - touch @entity38 bad for @entity4
