@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity3 , @entity4 , and sen. @entity5 , @entity6 , are demonstrating real leadership on a tough issue			0
their solution : a comprehensive reform bill combining enforcement with earned legal status for illegal immigrants , which they appear ready to introduce any day now			1
but before @entity19 returns to a debate that tied it up in knots a few years ago , and before @entity24 begin arguing -- on talk radio and blogs , at water coolers and @entity29 games -- over what to do about border security , workforce needs , the process for immigrating legally , and the status of 10.3 million illegal immigrants , we need to be absolutely clear about why the @entity24 has so much illegal immigration in the first place			1
until we can answer that question candidly and without regard for hurt feelings , we 'll never be able to curb the future flow of illegal immigrants			1
@entity24 remember the debate over the 1986 @entity43 , which offered amnesty to nearly 2.7 million illegal immigrants			1
now , many of them want a guarantee that , if they go along with offering illegal immigrants what would this time be a conditional legal status ( as opposed to " amnesty " ) , they wo n't have to go through all this again in another 24 years			1
well , that 's up to us -- and how we address the question : why does the @entity24 have so much illegal immigration ? the answer is not as simple as what you hear from the right -- that we have n't been serious about border enforcement , and have instead created a social services magnet that draw migrants north in search of free benefits			1
and it 's not as simple as what you hear from the left -- that trade deals like @entity69 have destroyed the @entity71 economy and thus propelled immigrants north in search of higher wages			2
it 's not just because of porous borders , or a reluctance to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants , or because @entity71 is a " failed state " that ca n't provide enough jobs for its own people			1
everyone likes to point fingers			0
and no one wants to accept any degree of responsibility for the problem			0
that 's what many @entity24 find so appealing about this fantastical rhetoric about how the country is experiencing an " invasion " as if we were all sitting in our backyards and minding our own business when , over the horizon , came an army of nannies , gardeners , housekeepers , short - order cooks , chamber maids , construction workers and farm laborers demanding to do our chores			1
why does the @entity24 have so much illegal immigration ? i know the answer			1
it 's because of me , and tens of millions of other @entity24 just like me			2
we create the demand for illegal immigrant labor not because of anything we do but because of all the things that we will not do -- at any wage			2
even as someone who juggles several jobs , i have to admit that my work ethic -- especially for hard , physical labor -- is a distant second to that of my immigrant grandfather who came from @entity71 legally in the early 1900 's			1
my grandfather was a farm worker who would make it a point to show up to a job early and start working a half hour before he clocked in , as his way of showing appreciation to his employer for hiring him			0
there are days when my employer does n't see me before noon , because i 'm writing somewhere else or giving a speech or making my kids breakfast			2
my grandfather would do any kind of work without complaint and graciously accept whatever wages were offered because he felt as if the employer was doing him a favor by giving him a way to support his family			0
when i start a new job , i instinctively negotiate for a higher salary and more vacation time than i had at my last one -- that is , more money for less work -- and i usually feel like i 'm doing the employer a favor by showing up			0
now multiply me by 10 million or 20 million			0
and amplify it for all those @entity24 who are younger than me , those 18 - to - 35 - year - olds who have been raised by their parents to shun hard work and think of themselves as special and entitled to high - paying and non-strenuous jobs that are also emotionally satisfying			1
if @entity24 want to stop importing foreign workers , either legally or illegally , then we had better start producing domestic workers who will do the kinds of hard and dirty jobs that our grandparents did without complaint -- and that now , these many years later , most of us wo n't do without complaining			1
you wo n't hear that from members of @entity19			0
they 're too worried about staying popular with constituents , and insulting parenting skills would not be helpful			0
but lawmakers have to get over that , and start dealing with the issue of illegal immigration with honesty and courage			2
or they 'll only make the problem worse			0
a lot of you like to beat your chests and talk tough on this issue			0
well , in this case , the problem is with your constituents			0
they 're the ones who need the scolding			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195			2
