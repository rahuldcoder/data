@entity0 -- as @entity0 gears up for january 's presidential inauguration with high - priced tickets to fancy affairs , one businessman is making sure that some of the less fortunate will have a chance to share in the festivities			1
@entity9 is a @entity10 businessman helping the disadvantaged see the inauguration			1
@entity10 businessman @entity9 has spent $ 1 million to give hundreds of poverty - stricken and terminally ill @entity12 , along with wounded men and women in uniform , an inauguration experience that wo n't cost them anything			1
the zero - dollar price tag is even more shocking , considering that tickets to the inaugural events are going for hundreds of dollars , the city 's remaining hotel rooms are edging into four - figure territory , and even basements and couches miles from the @entity26 are going for a premium on @entity28			1
tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of @entity32 , and just 240,000 seats are available for the swearing - in ceremony			1
the tickets are supposed to be free , but with demand outpacing supply , some people have been trying to scalp tickets for thousands of dollars			2
@entity9 's event is one of the splashiest inauguration packages out there			1
it includes high - end hotel rooms and luxury suites , food and drinks , a heated viewing spot right above the parade route , even gowns and tuxedos to wear to celebratory balls and a beautician to help attendees get ready			2
hours after the election , @entity9 , a 60 - year - old businessman and son of a baptist minister , invested in what the @entity59 billed as its $ 1 million " build - your - own - ball " inaugural hotel package			1
his family 's nonprofit foundation , the @entity64 , is footing the bill for what it is calling the @entity69 's @entity68 , but it is also hoping to get money from sponsors			0
@entity9 said thursday that he hopes the balcony terrace is filled " with those who are disadvantaged , those who are distressed , mingling with those who are n't so			1
and we hope to see on their faces a sense of excitement			0
" " i was inspired to do this by the lord			0
... it 's not about us but about us helping other people , " he said			0
at least third of the tickets to the event will go toward people who are needy or underprivileged , and the rest of those participating could be people from sponsoring foundations , companies or volunteers			2
everything , he said , will be taken care of : transportation , evening gowns and tuxedos for the ball			0
he hopes that providing a front row seat to history will inspire those invited to do good things in their communities			0
@entity9 said he began thinking about the project in march			2
he voted for @entity108 , and records show he contributed $ 4,600 to the @entity111 's campaign , according to the @entity112			0
@entity9 , a retired @entity113 officer , noted that he does not agree with all of @entity108 's positions			2
but , he told the paper , he decided the inauguration would be " a transition in history , if you will ... and everyone should be included			0
" @entity1 's @entity121 and @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
