it was the computer classroom where i cracked			2
i 'd managed to remain detached until then			2
i wanted to tell the story			2
look , but do n't internalize , was the mantra i was repeating inside my head			2
tell the facts , explain what you are seeing and what happened			2
i do n't think i 've been somewhere with so much blood on the floor			1
over the years , covering wars , i 've seen more than my share			2
@entity13 , the war in @entity15 as @entity16 tore itself apart , was an inoculation against my visceral fear of the red stuff			2
in that conflict , mortars ripped through crowds of civilians			2
i soon learned how head wounds bleed			2
here it was again in the auditorium			0
do n't think , focus and do your job , i was reminding myself			0
but after a while i could n't			0
these were children , innocents			1
parents not far from here are suffering a harrowing pain none of us can imagine			1
parents , whose job in the army is to protect their country , not able to save their own children			1
the army officer showed us the doors where the children had tried to break out of the auditorium to run away from the @entity46 gunmen			1
the carpet is sticky and red			0
the floor tiles a mess of the worst of @entity13			0
the @entity46 could not have been more callous and calculating			0
where the children were most concentrated they turned their automatic weapons on them at point - blank range			1
the officer tells me close to 100 children were gunned down right here			1
again , i 'm telling myself to focus			0
explain this brutal cowardly act			0
leaving the dark , sad auditorium for the light of day i feel i can breathe better			0
i look up at the sky			0
it 's the color of hope -- clear blue and not a cloud to be seen			1
i should n't have looked down again			0
i 'm walking over to the classrooms at @entity68 and @entity69			0
drops , smudges , pools of blood are everywhere			1
i 'm becoming conscious that i 'm trying not to step on them			0
how , i am thinking , could the @entity46 be looking for even more bloodletting when they have already killed so many ? but they are			1
that 's when i get to the computer classroom , maybe 30 feet long by 15 feet across			1
computers on rough benches down each side of the room			0
space for maybe a dozen or so children to hone their computer skills			1
you did n't have to be rich to send your child to this school , and in @entity89 -- in @entity90 in particular -- on a global scale that implies your means might be quite humble indeed			1
quite possibly some of these kids would n't have a computer at home			0
in our ever - interconnected world , lessons in this room could have been some of the most valuable to their futures			0
i 'm standing there realizing they have no futures now			0
the base horror that took place here is startlingly and immediately evident			1
chairs still at computers , thick blood pooled underneath on the tile floor			1
the gunmen came in and before the children could escape opened fire			1
as i try to explain all this on camera , i can feel my voice cracking			0
it 's not a conscious thing , its what the brain does , a self - defense maybe			1
such a horrible waste of so many bright futures , so many parents in pain			1
it hurts , and there is no getting away from it .			0

@entity135 's @entity134 visits the @entity89 school where *132* children were killed
blood covers floors , walls
not far away parents are *grieving* while he tries to understand the horror
there is no getting away from the pain of the wasted young lives
