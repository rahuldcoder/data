until this year , the nonprofit referred to it as the list of failed states			2

the top nation on that list was the @entity43 , which is deep in a conflict involving widespread atrocities			0

" the recent worsening of the @entity12 , @entity15 , and @entity81 also shows us that instability is not exclusive to developing countries , " the group said			2
the three nonetheless remain near the bottom of the overall fragility rankings , in a group of nations classified as " very stable			0
