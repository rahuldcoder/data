-- he has beheaded again			0
the tall , masked @entity3 man with the @entity5 accent , working with @entity6			1
his first two victims were @entity8 journalists			0
his third was a fellow citizen , @entity3 aid worker @entity10			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity11 hastily assembled a meeting of his top national security advisers in the early hours of sunday morning to discuss what can be done			0
according to @entity3 officials , @entity11 knows the identity of the @entity3 executioner			1
@entity6 executes @entity10 , @entity11 vows justice he also knows that the executioner has already killed two citizens of his country 's closest ally and he knows that the executioner holds at least two other @entity8 citizens			2
@entity11 knows that the executioner holds other hostages from additional @entity28 countries and that he is part of a larger group of @entity3 hostage - takers working for @entity6 , nicknamed " the @entity33 " by their captives			1
and he knows that the lives of the remaining hostages are in grave danger			0
it is a real crisis for @entity11 , and it underlines a sobering fact : @entity3 citizens have volunteered to go to @entity40 to fight at 25 times the rate that @entity8 have done so , when adjusted for population size			1
some 500 @entity3 citizens have traveled to @entity40 to fight , as have 100 @entity8			1
the population of the @entity3 is about a fifth of that of the @entity48			0
a @entity3 government assessment by the @entity50 provided to @entity0 shows that the @entity3 have already arrested 69 people this year for " @entity40 related terrorist offences " that include terrorist financing , preparing an act of terrorism , and attending a terrorist training camp			1
in 2013 , 25 people were arrested in the @entity3 on similar charges , bringing the total number of arrests to 94 , according to the @entity3 government assessment			2
by contrast , only eight have been arrested for similar @entity40 - related terrorist crimes in the @entity48			0
@entity6 execution videos strikingly similar the war in @entity40 is attracting @entity3 fighters from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds , not just those of @entity40 descent			1
a @entity3 official told @entity0 that the vast majority of @entity3 fighters going to @entity40 do not have any real links to the country other than a desire to fight in a holy war against the @entity80 regime			2
alarmed by the threat posed by its citizens fighting in @entity40 , the @entity3 government has already refused to issue or has cancelled 23 passports and has also revoked the citizenship of eight @entity3 citizens , according to the @entity50			1
the @entity3 agency also underlines the threat posed by other @entity89 citizens who have traveled to @entity40 , who can freely travel around the @entity90 , including the @entity3 , and who can also travel to the @entity48 without visas as they are from so - called " visa waiver " countries			2
statement from the family of @entity10 according to the @entity3 government , 700 fighters have traveled to @entity40 from @entity98 ; 400 from @entity99 ; between 300 and 500 from @entity100 ; 130 from the @entity101 ; over 100 from @entity102 ; 100 from @entity103 ; 80 from @entity104 ; and between 50 and 100 from @entity105			2
the @entity3 government also estimates that 100 @entity106 have left @entity106 to " support or train with terrorist movements abroad			0
the majority of these are likely to be in @entity40			0
" and it estimates that there are 60 @entity114 fighting in @entity40 and @entity115 and about 100 @entity114 " facilitators " helping to make this possible in @entity114			0
this brings the total number of @entity120 who have fought in @entity40 to between 2,620 and 2,870 , according to the @entity3 @entity122 obtained by @entity0 , which is likely the most authoritative estimate yet			1
despite the fact that the @entity3 government has identified the executioner of the two @entity8 journalists and of @entity10 , it is not making his name public " for operational reasons			1
" that 's because the only likely hope for the remaining hostages is some kind of rescue operation similar to the one that the @entity8 @entity136 mounted on july 4 , which did n't achieve its purpose because the prisoners had been recently moved from the location where they were being held in @entity40			0
a rescue operation is a long shot , but at this point it may be the only real chance of saving the lives of the remaining hostages			0
@entity11 knows this -- and so does president @entity146 .			0

@entity6 executioner , tall man with @entity5 accent , has beheaded a third man , a @entity3 aid worker
@entity152 says @entity3 officials believe they know the identity of the killer
a @entity3 estimate puts the number of @entity120 fighting in @entity40 at more than 2,600
@entity160 : @entity3 officials not releasing the name of the killer " for operational reasons "
