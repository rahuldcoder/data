@entity1 prime minister @entity0 said sunday that @entity1 can not negotiate with the government of @entity4 president @entity3 while it is backed by @entity5			1
" i call on president @entity3 : tear up your pact with @entity5 , " @entity0 said on @entity8 's " @entity7			1
" " we 're not going to negotiate with a government backed by @entity5 unless @entity5 changes its position and says it 's willing to recognize @entity1 , " he said			1
@entity0 's comments come four days after the @entity3 - led @entity4 movement @entity15 , which controls the @entity16 and dominates the @entity4 , said it would attempt to form a unity government with @entity5 , the militant @entity18 group that controls @entity19			1
@entity5 has n't recognized @entity1 's right to exist , and @entity1 canceled scheduled peace talks after wednesday 's announcement			1
@entity0 said that if @entity1 can not reach peace with @entity26 through an agreement , " we 'll seek other ways " to achieve peace			1
" i 'm not going to accept a stalemate , " he said			0
but @entity4 lawmaker @entity29 swiftly criticized @entity0 's " extremely cynical " declaration			2
@entity29 accused the @entity1 leader of trying to torpedo the peace process by expanding @entity1 settlements in the @entity16 , where most of a projected @entity4 state would be located , and maintaining the @entity1 blockade of @entity19			2
" he did everything possible to undermine the talks , and now he is using the pretext of reunification in order to say ' you do n't qualify , ' " @entity29 said			0
she dismissed @entity0 's assertion that he remained interested in a settlement of the decades - old conflict as " lip service			0
" " we judge by his actions , " she said			0
" he has been systematically dismantling the process , systematically destroying its very foundations and systematically destroying the very objective , which is a two - state solution , by stealing the land of the @entity4 state			0
very simply , if he is serious then he will act in a way that will demonstrate his seriousness			0
" in the interview sunday , @entity0 praised the efforts of @entity59 secretary of state @entity58 over the past nine months , saying the @entity59 has been " indispensable " in pushing for peace			0
" i appreciate secretary @entity58 's unbelievable efforts , " he said			0
" they do n't always succeed -- unfortunately , president @entity3 made sure of that by embracing @entity5			1
but i have to credit @entity58 for his efforts			0
" @entity0 also voiced skepticism over comments by @entity3 released sunday in which the @entity4 leader called the @entity70 the most heinous crime in modern human history			1
@entity3 " ca n't have it both ways , " by calling the @entity70 the most heinous crime in modern history while embracing @entity5 , a " terrorist organization that openly denies the @entity70 , " @entity0 said			1
he suggested @entity3 ' remarks , released by his office , were an attempt to placate @entity80 public opinion in the wake of @entity15 's step toward @entity5			2
the @entity4 territories of @entity19 and the @entity16 have been run separately for seven years			0
the split began taking shape in 2006 when @entity5 , participating in @entity4 polls for the first time , won a majority in the @entity4 parliament			2
the @entity4 formed a coalition government with @entity5 that year , with @entity3 retaining the presidency and @entity5 member @entity92 becoming prime minister			1
but when @entity3 dissolved the government in 2007 , @entity5 seized control of @entity19 , and @entity92 became @entity19 's de facto political leader			2
the @entity97 for years has shown support to @entity15 and warned it not to join hands with militant @entity5 , which several countries , including the @entity59 , have deemed a terrorist organization .			0

@entity1 *pm* @entity0 says @entity1 wo n't take part in negotiations backed by @entity5
" i call on president @entity3 : tear up your pact with @entity5 , " @entity0 says
