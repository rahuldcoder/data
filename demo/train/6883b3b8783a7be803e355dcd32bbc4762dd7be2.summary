-- for the past decade , @entity2 researcher @entity1 has been moving the data from his brain onto computers -- where he knows it will be safe			1
@entity1 wearing a @entity7 , which automatically records photos throughout the day			1
sure , you could say all of us do this to some extent			1
we save digital pictures from family events and keep tons of e-mail			1
but @entity1 , who is 75 years old , takes the idea of digital memory to a sci - fi-esque extreme			1
he carries around video equipment , cameras and audio recorders to capture his conversations , commutes , trips and experiences			1
@entity2 is working on a sensecam that would hang around a person 's neck and automatically capture every detail of life in photo form			1
@entity1 has given that a whirl			1
he also saves everything -- from restaurant receipts ( he takes pictures of them ) to correspondence , bills and medical records			1
he makes @entity42 files out of every web page he views			2
in sum , this mountain of data -- more than 350 gigabytes worth , not including the streaming audio and video -- is a replica of @entity1 's biological memory			1
it 's actually better , he says , because , if you back up your data in enough places , this digitized " e-memory " never forgets			2
it 's like having a multimedia transcript of your life			1
by about 2020 , he says , our entire life histories will be online and searchable			1
location - aware smartphones and inexpensive digital memory storage in the " cloud " of the @entity64 make the transition possible and inevitable			2
no one will have to fret about storing the details of their lives in their heads anymore			1
we 'll have computers for that			2
and this revolution will " change what it means to be human , " he writes			2
@entity1 , who , along with fellow researcher @entity77 , is the author of a new book called " @entity79 , " talked with @entity0 about the advantages and drawbacks of recording one 's life in painstaking digital detail			1
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what have you learned about yourself through this process ? that 's been a really hard question to answer			2
... the main driver of the recall turns out to be a [ computer ] screensaver or something where i go looking for [ a digital memory ] and i find something else			2
i guess it 's the rich set of connections and people that i 've been involved with			2
@entity0 : what do you use to record your memories ? in a way , most of what happens during the day is sort of routine -- what you 've done before			1
so i carry the sensecam only when i think there 's an episode or a sequence or a certain set of events that i want to capture and have automatically photographed			2
but i tend to always carry a camera with me			2
i live next to a fire station and i 've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house			0
and i like food so i tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time			0
to me those are very pleasant memories			1
@entity0 : if we rely on computers instead of our brains , will humans become mentally sluggish ? that 's certainly one of the concerns			0
i tend to counter that theory			0
to me , i feel a lot freer			0
in a way i feel like i still remember all that stuff , but i generally remember that [ the computer is ] remembering something for me so i can find it			0
people have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone -- their address book is in a cell phone			1
so i do n't think they 're getting any worse or any less facile about that			0
what an e-memory does , to me , is gives me a really wonderful free feeling			0
@entity0 : if we all record audio of our lives , do you think conversations will become stilted and fake ? i think there will be a lot of court cases and lawyering around all of that			0
i 'm personally less hung up about that			0
certainly , people my age and @entity162 are			0
but the current @entity164 , [ they think ] this is pretty natural			0
@entity0 : are you on @entity167 and @entity168 ? yeah , i 'm on @entity167 and @entity168 and occasionally i will tweet something			0
somehow my problem is that i do n't think i have anything interesting to tweet about			0
@entity0 : should all of our memories and observations be public ? absolutely not			1
our own memories are our own private thing , and how much you choose to have on @entity167 or blogs , that 's your thing			1
@entity0 : what does your family think about your effort to record everything ? gradually , everybody is getting this idea			0
... think of it : you are a librarian for your life			1
somebody has to be the family librarian			0
@entity0 : are you worried about losing your memory ? ... forgetting is not a feature , it 's a flaw			0
i do n't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory			0
i think it 's important to be able to remember things accurately			0
@entity0 : are there any memories you deleted ? no. when we were scanning stuff i had written a memo about a company , an unpleasant company -- probably the only company i was ever ashamed to be a part of			1
... i put a note on that file that said , " do n't ever scan or copy this ! " my assistant who was doing the scanning ran across this and said , " what do you want me to do with this ? " and i said , " well , gee			0
" i said , " it 's ok , just go ahead			0
" so it 's all there			0
@entity0 : do you think it 's possible for people to turn away from new technologies ? or are advances like " @entity79 " inevitable ? i think it 's inevitable because so much content is being created			1
virtually everything is coming in digitally -- everything from your photos to your videos to your music			1
... i will love that day when the world is just bits			0
it 's the ultimate in green , by the way .			0
