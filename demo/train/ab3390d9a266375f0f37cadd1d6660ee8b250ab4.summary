-- internet users around the globe are facing slowed - down service , thanks to what 's being called the biggest cyberattack in history			1
the prolonged denial - of - service assault is targeting the @entity9 , a @entity10 spam - fighting group that has gone after @entity11 , a data - storage company that offers to host any content " except child porn and anything related to terrorism			1
" the organization has been in a long - running feud with @entity11 and claims spammers use it as a host from which to spray junk mail across the @entity23			2
internet security firm @entity24 said @entity9 contacted it last week , saying it had been hit with an attack big enough to knock its site offline			1
security experts say the attack uses more sophisticated techniques than most @entity30 ( distributed denial of service ) attacks and targets the @entity23 's infrastructure , which has led to other sites performing slowly			1
" it 's the biggest attack we 've seen , " @entity35 , @entity24 's ceo , told @entity0			0
the @entity38 is involved in the investigation into the cyberattack on @entity9 , though a bureau spokesman did n't provide any details on the @entity38 's role or the scope of the probe			1
the @entity9 is a nonprofit organization that patrols the internet for spammers and publishes a list of web servers those spammers use			1
according to @entity35 , the group may be responsible for up to 80 % of all spam that gets blocked			1
this month , the group added @entity11 to its blacklist			2
" while we do n't know who was behind this attack , @entity9 has made plenty of enemies over the years , " @entity35 wrote in a blog post			1
" spammers are n't always the most lovable of individuals , and @entity9 has been threatened , sued and ddosed regularly			1
" in a @entity30 attack , computers flood a website with requests , overwhelming its servers and causing it to crash or become inaccessible for many users			2
one way to defend against those attacks , @entity35 said , is to deflect some of the traffic targeted at a single server onto a bunch of other servers at different locations			0
that 's what happened in this case , and why web users experienced some slowdowns on other sites			2
he told @entity0 the last big wave of the attack hit tuesday morning , but that he does n't " live under the illusion " that there wo n't be more			0
for its part , @entity11 is n't taking credit for the attack			0
but the @entity92 company , housed in a former @entity94 nuclear bunker , is n't shying away , either			2
" this here is the internet community puking out @entity9 , " @entity11 founder @entity95 told @entity0			1
" we 've had it with the guys ...			0
what we see right here is the internet puking out a cancer			2
" he said the owners of various websites got together on a @entity108 chat and hatched the plans for the attack			0
he says that @entity111 , a group organized to support @entity11 in the dispute , ceased the attack after three days but that other hackers and activists kept it up after that			2
@entity95 and other critics say that @entity9 oversteps its bounds and has essentially destroyed innocent websites in its spam - fighting efforts			1
" @entity9 itself is a more urgent danger " than spam , @entity95 told @entity0			1
" pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down and then they get it shut down without any court order			0
that is a significantly larger threat to internet and freedom of speech and net neutrality than anything else			2
" @entity139 , a researcher with the @entity9 , said the group 's record speaks for itself			1
he said the project has existed for over 12 years and its data is used to protect more than 1.7 billion e-mail accounts worldwide			0
" we have 1.7 billion people looking over our shoulders to make sure we do our job right , " he said			0
" if we start blocking things they want , they wo n't use our data any more			0
" he emphasized that @entity9 does n't have the power to block e-mail from anyone -- it merely makes its data available for service providers and other web companies to use			1
@entity159 said @entity9 experienced its first denial - of - service attack in 2003			1
" this has been the biggest for us , " he said , " but certainly not the first one			0
" @entity24 's @entity35 said denying access to a website through cyberattacks is the truest assault on web freedom			0
" our role is to allow the internet to achieve what it aspires to -- that anyone , anywhere can publish any piece of information and make it accessible to anyone , anywhere else in the world , " he said			0
" it 's blatant censorship			0
" whether @entity9 is a good organization or a bad organization is irrelevant to me			1
we protect @entity185 financial institutions , which some people think are evil , and we protect @entity187 , which some people think are evil			0
" @entity0 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
