the @entity0 campaign has now confirmed a longstanding business relationship that enabled his consulting group to receive between $ 1.6 and $ 1.8 million from mortgage giant @entity4 but it was n't for " lobbying , " @entity0 insists			1
it was for " strategic advice on a wide range of issues			0
" ok , but then does n't the payment , @entity12 's @entity11 asked the former @entity15 speaker , just remind people that " your background comes from being a @entity20 insider ? " " it reminds people , " @entity0 corrected @entity22 , " that i know a great deal about @entity20			1
" and as he continued , " if you want to change @entity20 , we just tried four [ sic ] years of amateur ignorance and it did n't work very well , so having some - body who knows @entity20 might be a really good thing			0
" @entity0 is certainly right about that			1
there is no candidate for president who has had more experience in changing @entity20 than @entity0			2
indeed , there may be no @entity37 since @entity38 who has had more of an effect in making the institution of @entity41 what it is today			2
for as far too few remember , more than any other living @entity37 , it is @entity0 who gave us the current version of our hopelessly dysfunctional @entity41 — an institution which , according to a @entity50 / @entity49 poll , now has the confidence of 9 % of the @entity37 people			1
that monster is his baby , and no one should deny him his parental bragging rights			0
the question for @entity0 now , however , is whether he wants to change that institution — again			2
for nothing in his campaign so far has either explained what went so wrong in the practices that he helped birth , or how we might possibly reform them			0
and it is this , i suggest , more than anything else that @entity37 need " reminding " of			0
the @entity71 of our @entity72 meant @entity41 to be a great deliberative body			2
it has become an embarrassment			0
@entity41 does n't deliberate to resolve important national issues			1
@entity41 fundraises , and postures to fundraise , to support the next fight for control			2
the transformation to this " @entity41 " began in 1993			2
after claiming @entity82 control of both houses of @entity41 in 1995 — for the first time in 40 years — @entity0 launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution , and of government			1
fundraising was the key to that strategy of control			0
the @entity82 came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money : $ 618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994 , compared to the @entity99 ' $ 488.68 million			1
in the four years between 1994 and 1998 , @entity82 candidates and party committees would raise over $ 1 billion			2
never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money , because never before had any party 's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task : fundraising			1
@entity0 concentrated the " work " of @entity41 into a three - day " work " week			1
he sent his caucus home for the rest of the week , in part so that they had time necessary to launch cross-country fundraising missions			0
he exploded the number of committees , radically increasing the number of fund - raising targets			0
he ended any idea of bipartisanship			0
instead , as rep. @entity126 , @entity127 , has described , the focus of @entity41 after @entity0 's reforms became the " majority of the majority , " ( i.e. , the majority of the @entity82 ) polarizing the institution to the end of assuring ever more loyal and energized troops			1
members of @entity41 now spend between 30 % -70 % of their time raising money to get re-elected to @entity41 or to get their party back into power			1
and not just the @entity82 : the democrats quickly followed the lessons of professor @entity0			1
and in the almost 20 years since he came to power , practically everything about that great institution has changed			2
gone is any semblance of deliberation , or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done , as opposed to the business of the party in power			1
instead , the institution that @entity0 inherited — the one in which @entity99 worked with @entity82 to pass the most important tax reform in modern history ( @entity157 's ) , and in which @entity82 led @entity99 to break a filibuster in the @entity159 and pass the most important social legislation in a century ( the @entity160 ) — was gone			1
what replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution which practically no @entity37 has confidence in today			0
more important to the right , as the business of @entity41 became the business of fundraising , the ideals that had brought @entity0 to power quickly got compromised			1
fundraising demands pushed the @entity82 leadership to give up on its stated goal of shrinking the size of government , so that it could better use the power of majority status to raise campaign cash			1
as the @entity180 's @entity179 reported in his 2009 book , " so damn much money " : " republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size			2
[ but ] their ambitions were soon compromised			0
... @entity0 initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending ...			0
but in the face of perceived political necessity , the leadership wavered			0
cutting spending was good , but @entity0 , ( @entity194 ) @entity193 , ( @entity195 , and others quickly realized that ' we have another aspect to our existence here , which is that we must use the @entity200 as a resource to protect our vulnerables , because once we got into power , we wanted to stay in power			1
' " the job of @entity41 was no longer the work of the nation			1
the job of @entity41 was to help its majority " to stay in power			1
" this is the legacy of @entity0			0
it has been followed by @entity82 and @entity99 alike			0
it is a legacy that has done the nation great harm			0
and much more important than the question of how @entity0 might have profited personally from the economy of influence that he helped build is the question of whether , and how , he now intends to " change " it			0
so it is perfectly true , mr. speaker , that you have the most " change " experience of any candidate for president			0
so would you use it this time to do good ? or would you continue to defend the practices that have destroyed the crown jewel of the @entity231 : @entity41 .			0

@entity233 : @entity0 *fundamentally* changed nature of @entity41
he says the speaker focused @entity82 on fundraising , rather than nation 's business
under @entity0 , holding power *trumped* deliberation on real issues
@entity233 says @entity82 gave up goal of shrinking government to avoid losing donations
