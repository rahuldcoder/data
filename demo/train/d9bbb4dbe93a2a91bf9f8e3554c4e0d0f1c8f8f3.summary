-- sitting in an @entity2 © , i see no sign of @entity4 , 35 , whose career has soared since playing @entity7 's love interest in " mission : @entity9 " could it be that the famously down - to - earth star -- who grew up in @entity13 , @entity14 , population : 850 -- has turned diva ? just then , a redhead in the back waves ( she has dyed her hair for a role )			1
soon , all worries about her having gone @entity23 vanish			1
sipping mint tea , she talks workouts , health scares , and her secret weapon for @entity28			1
q : in your new film , @entity31 , you play the wife of an ex-drug - addict - turned - evangelist who crusades to protect @entity36 children from the horrors of war			1
what drew you to it ? when i was growing up , my parents took in foster children			1
from a young age , i learned that there are a lot of children in need			1
i am a firm believer that you can make a difference in someone 's life -- whether they 're thousands of miles away , or on your own block			1
q : how has your childhood put your @entity23 life into perspective ? i come from a very working class background			1
my dad worked in a factory for 40 years			1
we all put ourselves through school			1
so i 've never felt entitled to anything			1
q : your daughter , @entity67 , is 3			2
what did you do to get your body back in shape after having her ? i started with ab work , since after pregnancy the abs are shot			1
for the first time , i enjoyed working out : it was having that reprieve for an hour of alone time			2
it gave me more energy			2
@entity0 : 6 rules for a healthy postpartum slim down q : how do you stay in shape these days ? i do squats , lunges , strength training			2
i ran a half - marathon in april with my cousins , mom , and aunts			1
after that , we had big plans to do the @entity98 , but two weeks later , we were asking , " are we really going to do it , or were we just on a runner 's high ? " i have n't run since ! q : what is the toughest part of working out for you ? just getting there ! i 've gotten down the stairs and thought : workout or post office ? it 's either physical torture or mental torture			1
so sometimes i go with the mental torture and stand in line at the post office in my workout gear			2
q : what body part are you proudest of ? i have nice muscle tone in my arms			2
i ca n't really take credit for it , though -- all the members of my family do			2
a lot of arm wrestling happened in our family growing up ! @entity0 : get gorgeous arms q : do you have any body challenges ? the old bum and thigh area			2
i hope most women agree with me ! [ @entity134			0
] keeping it toned , dealing with cellulite			0
i hate when i feel it move after me			0
q : any health regrets ? i smoked for almost 10 years			0
thankfully , i came out on the other side			0
i hope my lungs are repairing themselves now			0
q : you 've known your husband [ @entity146 graphic designer @entity145 ] for nearly 11 years			0
do you find he " gets " you ? he gets me on every level			0
during " that time of the month , " he knows to bring me a @entity149 bar			0
he 's good like that ! and a few years ago i had a mole on the back of my calf , and he was adamant that i get it checked			1
in @entity146 , they 're very aware of skin cancer			0
i finally went and it was skin cancer			0
i had quite the chunk taken out of my leg			0
i 'm so grateful he noticed it			0
i clearly now realize he has a keen eye and wonder what other imperfections he 's noticing ! [ @entity134			1
] @entity0 : is it a mole ... or skin cancer ? q : so , cosmetic surgery -- for or against ? i do n't think it 's for me			1
the acting that i respect is about conveying emotion without really speaking			0
i 'm not saying i jump for joy when i see new laugh lines , but i would try every possible recourse before going under the knife			0
q : with all you juggle , how do you stay in touch with your sensual side ? a new bra goes a long way -- and when i say a new bra , i mean a real treat , like one from @entity187			0
not the matching sets ; i like to mix and match			0
and if i can finagle a foot massage , i will give you the moon			0
