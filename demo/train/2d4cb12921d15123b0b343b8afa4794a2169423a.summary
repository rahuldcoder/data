-- for the record , i 'm not a leading fan of the economist @entity4			1
but even from the " away " team benches , you have to salute the audacity of his latest adventure			0
@entity4 , director of the @entity10 at @entity11 , has nominated himself to be president of the @entity13			1
he has launched a political campaign to win the necessary votes from governments worldwide			0
he has won the endorsements of eight governments and 27 members of the @entity20			0
nobody has ever seen anything like this before			0
while people do " campaign " for jobs as heads of international organizations , they usually do so from behind the scenes			0
their names mysteriously begin to be mentioned in the columns of @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , but they never admit on the record that they want the job , much less go on the road giving speeches and interviews asking for it			2
" there have been 11 presidents of the @entity13 , and not one of them yet has been an expert in international development , " @entity4 said in an interview with the @entity43 on march 8			1
" the world would be better off and @entity50 's interests in a peaceful world would be better served by an expert in development at the bank			1
" @entity55 is not even slightly coy about who that expert should be			1
in the end , the choice of @entity13 president comes down to an electorate of one , the president of the @entity50			1
the @entity50 is the single largest shareholder in the bank , and by tradition the bank 's president is always an @entity50			1
( by the same tradition , the president of the @entity68 is always a @entity70			2
) the past heads of the bank have usually either been bankers with close administration ties or else serious - minded politicians looking for a second career			0
appointment to the bank has also sometimes been used as a dignified way to say goodbye to officials whose services are no longer required			0
@entity83 sent @entity84 to the bank after @entity86			0
@entity87 sent @entity88 after @entity89			0
this suggests a more obvious nominee for president @entity92 : @entity93			1
the two former rivals from 2008 have worked together impressively until now			0
president @entity95 even stars in @entity92 's new 17 - minute campaign documentary -- an impressive healing of a once - bitter rift			2
still , you have to wonder how long @entity93 will want to play deputy to a president with strong foreign policy ideas of his own ; and how long @entity92 will wish to be served by a secretary of state who may be viewing a future after him in 2013 or 2017			1
this may be the moment for the hearty handshake , and the @entity13 may once again offer a convenient and appropriately grand refuge			1
so you 'd want to get good odds before placing a bet on the chances of an untraditional candidate like @entity55			1
but you also have to wonder : in the era of @entity116 and @entity117 , of viral media and guerrilla marketing , how long will it remain possible for important international leadership positions to be selected through secret processes ? it 's not only the head of the @entity13 who 's chosen by an opaque and elite process			1
the president of the @entity127 exercises more power than most of @entity70 's 27 elected heads of government			2
can you name him ? @entity131 did his best to raise the profile of the @entity68			0
do you know his successor ? the seven board members of the @entity135 have far more sway over the @entity50 economy than does the president of the @entity50			1
in recent years , the @entity135 chairman has become something of a national figure -- but not the other six			0
over the past quarter - century , formal democracy has spread as never before			2
from @entity146 , @entity147 , to @entity148 , @entity149 , a higher proportion of the human race lives under elected governments than ever in human history			0
yet as national governments yield power to international bureaucracies -- as even the work of domestic government becomes more complex and opaque -- practical democracy seems on the retreat			2
@entity55 ' quixotic campaign for @entity13 president wo n't change that reality , even in the unlikely event that he should somehow win			1
but the campaign can at least draw attention to the reality -- and the gap between how we imagine our societies to be run and how they really are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

economist @entity4 is *mounting* an *unusual* public bid to lead @entity13
@entity172 says *typically* the job is *awarded* by a @entity50 president after secret selection
he says @entity93 is a more likely candidate for the job than @entity55
@entity183 : in age of growing democracy , can top posts be handed out in secrecy ?
