@entity0 -- millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in @entity4 under a compromise plan proposed monday by a bipartisan group of eight senators			1
while temporarily removing legal uncertainty for the nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants , the senators ' outline also called for strengthening border controls , improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers			0
only after those steps occurred could the undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence -- green cards -- as a step toward citizenship , the senators told a news conference			1
" they would no longer be deported , provided they do n't have a criminal record			0
they would no longer be harassed , they would be allowed to stay here and work , " said @entity30 sen. @entity29 of @entity31 in describing the immediate impact of the framework if crafted into legislation and enacted			0
the outline for a possible immigration bill reflects a new willingness by mainstream republicans to compromise following their party 's defeat in november , when president @entity46 got strong backing from @entity49 voters			1
" elections , elections , " answered @entity50 sen. @entity50 of @entity51 , a veteran of past immigration battles in @entity53 , when asked to explain the push now for a bill that proved unattainable two years ago			0
" the @entity58 is losing the support of our @entity49 citizens , " @entity50 said			0
" we realize that there are many issues on which we think we are in agreement with our @entity49 citizens , but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens			0
" his party and all @entity4 now realized that " we can not continue as a nation with 11 million people residing in the shadows , " @entity50 added			0
@entity71 sen. @entity70 , a tea party - backed conservative considered a rising star in the @entity58 , said the goal was to create a " modern immigration system " that treated everyone fairly -- both the undocumented and those waiting to come to @entity4 legally			2
" none of this is possible if we do n't address the reality there are 11 million people in this country who are undocumented , " @entity70 said			0
however , another tea party - backed @entity58 , sen. @entity87 of @entity88 , objected to the framework by his colleagues , saying the guidelines " contemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to illegal immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country			0
" other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty , a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status			2
" when you legalize those who are in the country illegally , it costs taxpayers millions of dollars , costs @entity4 workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration , " said rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , who serves on the immigration subcommittee in the @entity108			1
" by granting amnesty , the @entity117 proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration			2
" @entity119 , a group seeking to reduce @entity4 immigration , called the @entity117 plan an attempt to " out - amnesty @entity46 " and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition			1
house speaker @entity125 's office was noncommittal , saying he looked forward to learning more about the senators ' plan			2
a similar effort on immigration is said to be under way in the @entity108 , involving a group of @entity58 and @entity30			1
two senior @entity108 @entity30 sources briefed on the effort told @entity1 the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon , possibly as early as this week , but concede " they are not as far along as the @entity117			1
" like the @entity117 framework , the @entity108 plan will include a path to citizenship , but details of how that will work are still being discussed			1
@entity50 and @entity70 , joined by three @entity30 colleagues at the news conference , acknowledged the political challenge , with @entity70 calling the legislative process ahead " enormously complicated			0
" read the senate plan @entity46 is expected to deliver a speech in @entity151 on tuesday to discuss comprehensive immigration legislation , which he calls a priority of his second term			1
according to senior administration officials , the president will say the senators ' plan represents progress and argue that now is the time to act			1
he will lay out his vision for immigration reform , which is consistent with the @entity117 plan , they said			2
@entity46 is not expected to present legislation during his speech , nor anytime this week			1
at the @entity108 , spokesman @entity167 said the president welcomed the senators ' framework , calling it a " big deal " because it included an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants			1
" he is encouraged by the progress we have seen from members of both parties in the @entity117 , and looks forward to working with members of both parties to reach a point in the hopefully not too distant future where we have a bill that has bipartisan support , that is very specific , and that he can sign because it meets his principles , " @entity167 said			2
path to citizenship : senators outline bipartisan immigration plan meanwhile , a litany of left - leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators ' plan , praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers			1
" the people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second - class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system , " noted @entity202 president @entity201			0
@entity30 senators backing the plan include @entity29 , @entity213 of @entity214 , @entity215 of @entity216 , and @entity217 of @entity218			2
on the @entity58 side , @entity50 and @entity70 were joined by @entity220 of @entity221 and @entity222 of @entity51			0
what you do n't know about @entity225 in @entity4 the eight senators based their framework on four " pillars , " described as : -- a " tough but fair " path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the @entity4 , but only after bolstering the nation 's border security ; -- overhauling the country 's legal immigration system , including attaching green cards to advanced degrees in science , technology , engineering , or math from @entity4 universities ; -- establishing an employment verification system that holds employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers ; -- creating a guest - worker program for positions that @entity4 are either unable or unwilling to fill			2
lawmakers : @entity58 needs to back immigration overhaul a source familiar with how the eight senators came up with the plan told @entity1 that @entity220 called @entity29 after the november vote to restart work on an immigration bill that broke down in 2010			1
soon , a core group of six senators formed and met five times in the following weeks in the offices of @entity29 and @entity50 , the source said , adding that @entity222 and @entity217 also took part in some of the meetings and were the last to agree to the proposal			0
opinion : worker visas are the key to immigration reform @entity29 said monday that an initial timetable called for delivering the text of a bill to the @entity270 by march , and @entity117 passage by late spring or in the summer			0
he and @entity213 called @entity46 on sunday to tell him of the agreement by the senators , @entity29 said , describing the president as " delighted			1
" @entity276 's clout increases in immigration debate @entity46 came under criticism from @entity49 activists for failing to deliver on 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term			1
last year , as his re-election campaign heated up , the @entity46 administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the @entity49 community			0
exit polls in november indicated @entity49 voters gave overwhelming support to @entity46 over @entity58 challenger @entity294 , who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves			0
five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform @entity300 : under deportation , above fear @entity1 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0
