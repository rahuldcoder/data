-- @entity2 leaders agreed to earmark 12 more individuals for visa restrictions and asset freezes in the second stage of their four - step plan to prompt @entity8 to renege on its annexation of @entity11			1
the list , which brings the total number of those targeted to 33 , puts the @entity2 on a position closer to the @entity16			1
the @entity16 also added to its tally of targets on thursday , tightening the noose around president @entity21 's inner circle			1
two @entity2 officials confirmed exclusively to @entity0 that the speaker of @entity8 's @entity24 , @entity23 , was among those set to be slapped with sanctions , as was the deputy prime minister @entity27			1
other names among the new additions included two key aides to @entity21 , @entity31 and @entity32 , as well as @entity33 , a tv anchor known for his provocative views			1
@entity2 members agreed unanimously on the candidacy of some the figures put forward after several hours around the negotiating table at a working dinner which ended after midnight on thursday			0
but some of bloc 's 28 states expressed reservations on the names put forward for fear of @entity8 retaliation , the aides said			2
@entity27 , in particular , the official said , was almost blocked by @entity50 and @entity51 , with the latter securing the right to allow him access to its country for meetings of an energy cooperation forum he chairs , one of the officials said			0
@entity60 also expressed concern about an unnamed candidate for sanctions , but withdrew its objection			0
@entity0 also understands that family members - considered key to the efficacy of any measures - were not explicitly mentioned amid questions about the legality of such a move and the viability of placing travel bans on individuals , who in some occasions are already resident inside the @entity2			1
and for those expecting swathes of @entity8 industry to feel the brunt of @entity82 's indignation , there may be disappointment			0
despite the @entity16 's move to penalise @entity85 , chief executives of the country 's largest companies , like @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 , will not feature on the @entity2 's additional file			0
what 's more : mr @entity21 's chief of staff @entity94 and his minister of defense @entity95 -- already frozen out by @entity16 -- were left off @entity82 's list for fear of sending a bellicose signal to @entity8			2
with many , disparate nations to consider , including some post-soviet states , the @entity2 has the tough job of balancing competing interests whilst ensuring no one single state will suffer disproportionately from the fallout its sanctions will bring			0
this week 's steps form part of a four stage process , which will also see @entity82 punish @entity8 's financial sector , its energy industry , trade , and its arms business , should the country not respond , people familiar with the discussions confirmed			0
