-- in a matter of days , my phone will start talking back			0
given that i already have what you might call a " co-dependent " relationship with my gadgets , this development is perhaps the next natural step			0
yet i know that phones are phones , and people are people , and the two must never be confused			0
the @entity13 , which will make my old @entity13 4 obsolete when it launches this friday , features the ability to hold voice conversations with its owner			1
the feature , named @entity19 , means that your @entity13 will respond to your voice commands -- ask it to find a nice restaurant , check your schedule or send a text message for you			1
you 'll receive a courteous reply			2
what 's more , your new iphone not only speaks but also has a gender : @entity19 has a female voice			1
ask @entity19 , " do i need a raincoat today ? " and she 'll look up the weather for you , replying helpfully , " it sure looks like rain today			1
" she 's so generous , in fact , that she 'll help you out before you even ask			1
passively say , " i 'm in the mood for sushi , " and @entity19 comes to your aid : " i 've found a number of sushi restaurants , " she 'll proclaim , adding in her characteristically specific fashion : " 22 of them are fairly close to you			1
" she 's pretty much an expert on food , to be honest			2
@entity47 restaurants ? @entity49 cuisine ? offer her dinner in any city , and she 'll know the best places to go			2
she knows all your friends , of course , and remembers all their phone numbers			0
she knows all your favorite songs and offers to wake you up in the morning			0
she 's adorably helpful like that			2
she has an amazing memory , too			0
tell her about any upcoming event , and she 'll remind you nearer to the time it 's scheduled			1
that kind of dependability is hard to find these days			0
not to mention , she 's quite the philosopher			2
her thoughts on the eternal question , " what is the meaning of life ? " show her softer side : " try and be nice to people			0
" she 's keenly intelligent , too , adding as an afterthought , " read a good book every now and then			2
" did i mention she 's great at directions ? go anywhere in the @entity78 and ask her how to get home : she 'll know			1
( swoon ! ) and that 's what 's great about this new era of voice - enabled technology : we can converse with our phones , newly equipped with intonation and intuition , without ever forming a dependence on them			1
we can accept that their creators have imbued them with a dose of personality without ever thinking that they 're actually people			0
we can converse more with our devices than we do with our spouses and yet never let our digital dialogues impinge on our human ones			0
this is a very bright future , and i 'm sure these new advances will have no negative consequences at all			0
@entity19 assured me of it -- and she 's right about everything .			1

the @entity13 features the ability to hold voice conversations with its owner
the feature , called @entity19 , lets new @entity13 respond to voice commands
tell her about any upcoming event and she 'll remind you nearer the time
@entity118 's @entity117 says this feature could be *revolutionary*
