-- i 'm frustrated by the story of " @entity6 " actress @entity4 ' claim of racism after being detained by a police officer			1
i think it is true that police officers , in general , are more likely to be suspicious of black people than white people in specific circumstances , and i know the phenomenon of " driving while black " happens			1
i have clients who have been pulled over , questioned and detained without any obvious probable cause			2
it reminds me of an incident a few weeks ago in which @entity20 producer @entity19 was detained by police officers for six hours until cops realized they had the wrong " tall , bald - headed black male			1
" such an event is demoralizing and humiliating , and it is evidence of how ingrained cultural biases affect law - abiding citizens			2
it 's the kind of action that gives black people reason to be distrustful of cops			1
what happened to @entity19 is the kind of incident that can help white people understand how racial bias impacts other people 's lives			1
white people , like it or not , receive the benefit of racial bias , although it 's hardly ever very apparent when it happens			1
when i quickly catch a cab in @entity46 , i do n't think , " that was easy because i was white			0
" when i 'm pulled over by police , i never think , " i bet this would go better if i was black			2
" it 's an unnatural thought process , but it 's a thought process that keeps many whites from understanding an experience shared by many blacks			0
when such an incident happens to a high - profile personality -- such as a @entity20 producer or actress -- it provides an opportunity for people from both sides of the racial divide to connect and identify with the story			1
in a situation like @entity19 's , it has the potential to foster a broader understanding of our inherent cultural biases			0
that 's a good thing ; it 's a conversation about race that has the potential to bring us closer together			0
but the details in the @entity4 ' case could produce the opposite effects			1
police responded to a very specific call : a white man and a black woman in a @entity79 involved in a sex act outside the @entity81			2
the officer explained why he had probable cause to ask for her identification			0
her continued refusal to comply resulted in her being temporarily placed in handcuffs			0
when her boyfriend persuaded her to produce her @entity90 , she was finally released			0
here are some basic legal procedures : police are allowed to ask you for your identification when they are investigating a particular event that may be a crime ; it 's part of their job			2
if they have probable cause to believe an actual crime occurred , they are allowed to arrest you			0
asking for your @entity90 is a polite first step to establish whether further investigation is appropriate and whether an arrest is warranted			0
i have analyzed and critiqued cops ' behavior lately , and i think law enforcement everywhere in this country has to do better , especially when it comes to addressing bias in their police work			1
however , there are some basic rules to follow when interacting with law enforcement : respect them and their authority -- indeed , their obligation -- to investigate circumstances			1
if a cop acts inappropriate , file that complaint later , not during the interaction on the street			0
that is a battle you simply will not win			0
in @entity4 ' case , the officer was doing his job , and it was @entity4 who was out of line			1
i think many people -- especially many white people -- are going to look at the @entity4 situation and come to the conclusion that she overreacted			2
in the best - case scenario , it detracts from the significance of cases like the @entity19 case , in which outrage is justified			0
in the worst - case scenario , @entity4 ' reaction re-entrenches prejudices held by some that black suspects contribute disproportionately to the contentious relationship between cops and the black community			1
either way , @entity4 ' behavior and her accusations in this case are not conducive to advancing thoughtful discussions about race			2
if we want a constructive conversation , we need to engage in a way that brings us together , not pushes us further apart .			0
