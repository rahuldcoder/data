-- the mother whose toddler died in a hot car near @entity4 last month says she finds comfort in faith but struggles to get through each day			1
" @entity10 is living every parent 's nightmare -- the child she bore and loved every moment of his life has died			1
for most parents , it is difficult , if not impossible , to comprehend such a thing			0
" but for @entity10 , that nightmare is all too real			1
she will never again be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him , " her attorney said tuesday in a statement			2
the statement marked the first time @entity10 has publicly described her feelings since she made remarks at the funeral for her 22 - month - old son , @entity26			1
his death in a hot car tapped parents ' outrage , garnered national headlines , and sparked a wide - ranging debate about whether more can be done to prevent such deaths			1
" she mourns @entity26 's death deeply , in her own private way			1
she takes comfort from a strong faith in @entity40 , but the loss is still overwhelming			0
getting through each day seems almost impossible , " said @entity43 ' attorney , @entity42			2
he asked for privacy for his client , comparing her situation to that of vindicated atlanta olympic park bombing suspect @entity48			0
" she asks that she be allowed to grieve in private without reporters calling , following or watching her home			0
since his death , she has been unable to have that time of mourning that every bereaved parent needs			2
please allow her the dignity to mourn her son in private , " @entity42 wrote			2
' constant speculation and innuendo ' police say @entity10 ' husband , @entity43 , left @entity26 strapped into a car seat in his suv for seven hours while he went to work on june 18			1
records show that the mercury topped 92 that day , and police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father 's workplace			2
@entity43 has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty			1
@entity10 is not a suspect , although police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her boy			1
for example , @entity43 and @entity10 took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care , and on the day @entity26 died , @entity10 arrived and was told that @entity26 had n't been dropped off that morning			1
" @entity43 must have left him in the car , " she allegedly told day - care employees			2
the day - care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that @entity26 was n't dropped off , but she insisted that @entity43 left him in the vehicle , @entity96 police detective @entity94 testified at a hearing for @entity43			2
he also said that @entity10 made an odd remark to her husband while the two were in an interview room after @entity43 ' arrest			1
" she asked him -- she had him sit down , and he starts going through this			0
and she looks at him , and she 's like , ' well , did you say too much ? ' " the detective testified			0
@entity10 ' attorney did not address those specific allegations in his statement , but warned against jumping to conclusions			1
" reporters have delved into @entity10 's upbringing , her employment , quizzed people for information about her marriage , and her sex life			1
the constant attention has prevented her from returning to work , " @entity42 wrote			0
" dealing with her grief has become more difficult as the days go on , however , in large part because of the constant speculation and innuendo in the media			0
newspapers , television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which @entity10 's every word , action and emotion -- or failure to cry in front of a crowd -- is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning			1
" ' i miss him with all of my heart ' @entity10 told @entity0 at the beginning of the investigation that a lawyer had advised her not to speak to the media , so not much is known about her			1
she did not testify at her husband 's probable cause hearing , but arrived before the proceeding began and took a seat with family members , holding hands with the woman sitting next to her			2
she did speak at her son 's funeral			2
she told mourners in @entity152 , @entity153 , that before @entity26 's birth , she was concerned " about never being able to have a child			2
" @entity10 described the toddler as perfect and told how he changed her and her husband 's lives			1
" as children do , he turned our lives upside - down , " she said			0
" cleaning , changing diapers , dinner , bath time			0
finally , what i would call mommy time			0
i would n't trade it for the world			0
" @entity10 said @entity26 had had trouble sleeping of late , and he had slept with her and her husband the two nights before he died , " snuggling in between both of us			1
" " i remember turning over in the middle of the night			0
his mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face			0
i will cherish that moment forever			0
" she said she was " happy " that @entity26 would miss some of life 's letdowns , including his first heartbreak , his parents ' and grandparents ' deaths and who to sit with at lunch at middle school			0
" i miss him with all of my heart			0
would i bring him back ? no. to bring him back into this broken world would be selfish , " she said			0
the mother closed by saying that she was n't angry with her husband and that @entity26 " meant the world " to @entity43 , whom she described as a " wonderful daddy			0
" @entity195 : in hot car death , leave the mom alone @entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			1
