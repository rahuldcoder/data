a strong storm over the @entity1 -- the remnants of @entity3 -- will bring intense winds , massive waves and heavy rain and snow to coastal @entity8 and the @entity9			1
but do n't ignore it just because it is a sparsely populated area with residents who are accustomed to severe weather			1
the powerful storm will whip the jet stream , causing a ripple effect that will carry the cold air to the @entity18			1
this arctic outbreak will funnel down through @entity20 over the next week , bringing a deep freeze to the eastern @entity22 , with temperatures forecast 20 degrees below average			1
the ripple of frigid air starts in @entity8 , where the remnants of @entity3 -- which earlier in the week was tied for the strongest storm typhoon of the year based on wind speed -- have strengthened , though it is n't a typhoon any longer			1
technically , it 's called a mid-latitude storm			0
the storm carries the energy of the typhoon and its current strength is derived from clashes of hot and cold air			2
this incredibly strong cyclone will alter the jet stream allowing for the cold air to plunge into the @entity22 next week			2
the effects of the cold air will be felt as early as the weekend , as temperatures will cool in the @entity18			1
but a second cold front with really cold air will make its way into the @entity46 and the @entity18 by the end of next week			2
that second front will bring snow from @entity50 to the @entity51 starting on sunday			0
by wednesday , snow may reach as far north as @entity53			0
the name " @entity55 " has been attached in the past to weather like this , but that is a misnomer			0
there is a thing called the @entity55 , and it is always present in the arctic atmosphere			0
the current storm is affecting the jet stream and allowing polar air to plunge farther south , but it is not a direct result of the @entity55 .			0

the remnants of @entity3 will bring severe weather to @entity8
the storm will send a ripple of frosty air to the @entity18 next week
temperatures will be 20 degrees below average on the @entity18
@entity8 will see strong winds , huge waves and heavy rain and snow
