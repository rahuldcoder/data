-- as the nation and the world 's attention turned to the impending execution of @entity6 in @entity7 before a late stay by a @entity7 court , one question seemed paramount : " why the rush ? " the answer to that question is buried deep inside the psychology of prosecutors and the culture of @entity7			1
@entity6 was scheduled for execution on wednesday for the 1993 killing of his girlfriend , @entity19 , and her two sons , until the @entity23 ( the top criminal court in that state ) issued a stay late on monday			1
while @entity6 was found hiding in another house after the murders and some tests showed the blood of the victims on his clothes , he has maintained his innocence			0
he claims he was in the house at the time of the killing , but was too incapacitated by alcohol and codeine to have hurt anyone			0
some question his conviction and point to @entity19 's uncle as another suspect , and @entity6 wants some of the items found at the scene tested for @entity46			1
even the foreperson of the convicting jury has now stepped forward to ask that the tests be conducted			0
however , the prosecutors have steadfastly refused to allow such testing , and @entity6 's attorneys have failed ( thus far ) to get a court order requiring those tests			1
the prosecutors have been adamant about an immediate execution , precluding further tests , and it is this fact that many people find baffling			1
as a former prosecutor who then spent 10 years training future prosecutors in @entity7 , i am not surprised by this development			1
quite simply , the prosecutors are committed to their conviction in a way that should surprise no one			1
to a prosecutor , convicting dangerous people and incapacitating them is a life 's work , nothing less than their duty to a community			0
prosecutors have wide discretion in choosing whom to charge with capital murder and whether to seek the death penalty for the person they have charged			1
once they have chosen that path , though , it is a somber commitment : it is nothing less than a public pledge to kill another person , and that is the kind of thing that is not done lightly			0
there is a deep emotional component to it , and that emotional commitment can not be ignored , especially when it no longer matches the trajectory of justice			2
academics such as @entity96 and @entity97 have studied the emotional overcommitment of prosecutors , and explain it in part by looking to peer groups			2
throughout the post-conviction process , prosecutors are usually surrounded by people ( such as supervisors and investigators ) who share their commitment to a conviction			2
at the same time , ethical rules keep them away from the person with the highest stake in the game , the defendant , who may want to challenge the outcome			0
among those complaining about the rush to execution has been the government of @entity120			2
here 's a news flash : @entity122 really do n't care much what the @entity120 think			0
what do @entity122 care about ? as even a casual observer of the campaign of @entity7 gov. @entity127 for president has probably noticed , many @entity122 care about the @entity129			1
@entity7 , for good or bad , has a highly christianized political culture , and the very center of the @entity132 gospels themselves contain a dramatic warning against the dangers of overcommitted prosecutors			1
at the trial of @entity138 it was the chief priest , @entity139 , who took the role of prosecutor			0
as the trial wore on , he became frustrated			0
the evidence had contradicted itself ; it suggested more than one story			2
finally , @entity139 could take no more and demanded an immediate outcome			0
he tore his shirt and said , " why do we still need witnesses ? " it was only then that @entity138 was condemned to die			0
that emotion , enough to tear your own shirt , is the kind of commitment that is in the heart of prosecutors			2
it is a passion born of good intentions , but one that can turn against the good			0
@entity139 was not a hero , and @entity122 of all people should understand that			0
the commitment of prosecutors is too rooted in emotion to be a deciding factor in a case such as this , and the objectivity of courts must bring to bear what is right			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1
