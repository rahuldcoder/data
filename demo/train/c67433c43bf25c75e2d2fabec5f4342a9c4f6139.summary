-- as the decade draws to a close it is time to reflect and reminisce on 10 years of glorious football drama -- and what better way to do this than by paying respect to the characters who have contributed so much to the soccer story that has captivated fans since 2000			1
two @entity13 -- in @entity14 and @entity15 , and @entity16 respectively -- provided the grandest of stages for some of the greatest footballers of the era to perform and show off their skills			1
aside of the biggest tournament in world football , these talented theatricals of the ball wowed audiences around the globe as they helped their sides , in both international and club arenas , to glory and success			0
the top stars of soccer have seen their salaries climb to record levels since the turn of the century , a reflection of the drawing power these modern - day entertainers wield , but if a team were to be selected of the eleven best performers , who would be included ? here is the @entity45 select eleven of @entity47 soccer heroes -- let @entity48 know what you think by adding your comment at the bottom of the page			1
@entity54 : the three - time @entity55 ( 1998 , 2000 and 2003 ) @entity54 brilliantly guided his nation @entity57 to the @entity59 title in 2000			1
the most famous of the " @entity60 " , he also inspired @entity61 to domestic honors and the @entity64 title in 2002			0
his career almost had a fairy tale ending , but an infamous sending off in extra time of the 2006 world cup final against @entity69 saw his last game soiled with controversy			0
@entity72 : the global power of @entity74 showed no sign of losing its luster as the decade came to an end as the former @entity80 captain remained the highest paid footballer in the world			0
super-fit at 34 , @entity74 continues to keep his place in @entity85 's @entity80 and holds the record 115 caps for an outfield player			1
the midfielder won two @entity90 titles with @entity91 , a @entity93 title with @entity61 and the @entity94 with @entity95 since the turn of the century			1
@entity97 : @entity97 became the most expensive player in football history after his $ 132 million transfer from @entity91 to @entity61 in 2009 , and his early performances for the @entity103 giants indicate he is worth every dime			1
2008 @entity105 also captains the @entity107 national side and won the @entity64 , the @entity108 and three @entity90 titles with @entity91			0
@entity110 : @entity111 's @entity110 is a four - time @entity105 and has raised the bar in the women 's game by showcasing her talents at @entity117 and @entity108 level			1
@entity110 has scored 54 goals in just 53 appearances for her country and helped them to silver medals in the 2004 and 2008 @entity117			0
only 23 , surely gold beckons in 2012			0
@entity97 : @entity97 's goal scoring feats with two in the final against @entity16 helped @entity111 to the 2002 @entity108 and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest players to wear the green and gold			0
he is the record scorer in @entity108 finals and in club football has averaged nearly a goal a game , notching 87 in 123 appearances for @entity61 from 2002 - 2007 , a statistic which helped @entity137 capture the @entity93 title in 2003			1
@entity139 : it is testament to @entity139 's ability and longevity that he made his final appearance in @entity145 colors in 2009 at the ripe old age of 40			0
@entity139 retired from international football with @entity69 in 2002 after 126 appearances but he remained one of the best defenders in the world and helped @entity145 to the @entity64 in 2007 , his fifth win in @entity154 's top club competition			1
the evergreen @entity155 also notched up a @entity157 title win and @entity108 win in the same decade			0
@entity159 : @entity159 is the newly - crowned @entity105 and his outstanding performances for @entity161 and @entity162 made him an almost unanimous choice			1
the 21 - year - old inspired @entity161 to a @entity103 league and cup and @entity64 treble , scoring the clinching second in the final against @entity91			1
add to this two other @entity93 titles and a @entity64 win in 2005 - 06 as well as scoring the winning goal to lift the @entity108 in 2009 , it is easy to see why @entity159 was a must pick			1
@entity174 : @entity174 was the first @entity175 to play in the @entity64 final when he appeared in @entity91 's 2 - 0 loss to @entity161 earlier this year			1
his tireless displays for the @entity180 champions marked him down as the finest player from that continent and he has played 84 times for @entity14 , helping them to @entity184 2010			0
the energetic midfielder helped @entity91 to three domestic titles and a @entity64 trophy in 2008			0
@entity188 : @entity188 began the decade as the most expensive footballer in the world after a controversial move from @entity161 to arch - rivals @entity61			2
his performances for @entity61 and @entity107 saw him named @entity59 and then @entity55 in 2000 and 2001			2
he retired in 2009 having helped @entity193 to four straight @entity195 titles and real to two league titles and a @entity64 win in the preceding decade			0
@entity198 : the @entity200 hit man produced the most outstanding displays of his star - studded career during his spell in the @entity90 with @entity204 , scoring 174 goals in 254 games for the @entity207 before he transferred to @entity209 giants @entity161 in 2007			2
on the international front , @entity198 has scored a record 51 goals for @entity57			2
since 2000 @entity198 picked up winners ' medals for two @entity90 titles , a @entity93 title , a @entity64 and @entity108 win			2
@entity217 : @entity193 striker @entity217 is widely acknowledged to have been the most accomplished footballer to emerge from @entity184 and has helped @entity219 to @entity117 gold in 2000 as well as two @entity222 triumphs ( 2000 , 2002 )			2
@entity217 -- who named @entity223 in 2003 , 2004 and 2005 -- scored 108 goals in 145 games for @entity161 helping the side to three @entity93 title wins that culminated in their historic treble in 2009 before being transferred to @entity193			2
