@entity0 -- the @entity2 approved a controversial $ 858 billion tax cut package wednesday , overwhelmingly voting to extend the @entity5 - era tax reductions despite a series of objections from both the left and the right			1
the measure passed 81 - 19 to advance to the @entity11 , which will take it up on thursday , according to majority leader @entity13 , @entity14			1
the package includes a two - year extension of the @entity5 - era tax cuts set to expire december 31			1
it also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months , cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year , restore the estate tax at a lower level and continue a series of other tax breaks			1
president @entity26 praised the vote and urged the @entity11 to quickly approve the bill , which the @entity29 negotiated with @entity2 @entity31 leaders			1
the @entity2 vote is " a win for @entity35 families , @entity35 businesses , and our economic recovery , " @entity26 said in a written statement			2
" as this bill moves to the @entity11 ... i hope that members from both parties can come together in a spirit of common purpose to protect @entity35 families and our economy as a whole by passing this essential economic package			0
" @entity11 @entity50 , however , have repeatedly warned that they may change the measure , particularly a provision dealing with the estate tax			1
currently , the estate tax is scheduled to exempt inheritances up to $ 1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55 %			0
under the tax package , it would be reduced to a rate of 35 % on amounts above a $ 5 million individual exemption			0
conservatives argue that a full return of the estate tax would , among other things , make it nearly impossible for many family - owned small businesses to be passed down from one generation to the next			0
liberals contend that a lower or nonexistent estate tax would merely benefit the wealthy while doing little to aid the economy			0
a number of @entity50 , including speaker @entity75 , @entity76 , want to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate @entity11 bill that would exempt inheritances up to $ 3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45 % rate			1
@entity75 said wednesday the change would bring in an additional $ 25 billion instead of providing tax protection to only 6,600 more families through the lower rate and higher exemption in the negotiated tax deal			2
however , more than two dozen moderate @entity11 @entity50 submitted a letter to their @entity11 leadership tuesday , calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it can go directly to @entity26 to be signed into law			2
" this bipartisan compromise is by design a temporary measure and , with its passage , we must acknowledge that our work is not done , " said the letter signed by 27 @entity50 as of tuesday evening			0
" we must continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion -- with a sense of shared responsibility -- toward solutions that address our economic and fiscal challenges			0
it is time for us to put aside the partisan talking points and accomplish what the @entity35 people sent us here to do			0
