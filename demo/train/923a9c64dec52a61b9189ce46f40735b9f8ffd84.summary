-- @entity1 was n't a foodie until she lost 222 pounds			1
the @entity4 - based communications director says she never used to taste her food			1
she ate mainly to feed an addiction			1
" i ate a lot of junk , and i was n't mindful about what i ate , " @entity1 said			1
but unlike with drugs or alcohol , where an addict can stop the behavior that they are addicted to , she knew she could n't stop eating			1
so she decided instead to stop eating and drinking out of habit			1
she started with small changes			1
she gave up diet soda first			1
for her it was a real sacrifice			1
" i would drink maybe six to eight @entity19 a day			2
i know people think it 's ok to drink since it does n't have calories , but i realized i never really had it on its own , " @entity1 said			1
" i was usually rinsing down a big bag of chips with it			2
" so she gave up chips			2
after that she stopped eating the @entity30 , their bright colors always taunting her from the bowl at a woman 's desk outside her office door			2
the tipping point at her heaviest , @entity1 weighed over 400 pounds			1
she says there was no one moment when she realized she needed to lose weight			2
the knowledge came in small waves			2
her daughter complained she walked too slow			2
she could n't join her friends on rides at the amusement park because she exceeded the weight limits			1
when she flew she had to use a seatbelt extender and actually got bumped once from a flight			2
when she got off the plane the gate agent told her he would put it in her profile that she had to buy two seats			2
@entity1 , 57 , does n't know exactly how she put on the weight			1
she just knows she gained about 10 to 15 pounds a year after the age of 15			1
" i do n't know at what point i remember thinking , ' @entity58 , i 'm over 200 pounds now , ' " @entity1 said			1
subconsciously , she may have been avoiding situations where she 'd have to confront it			2
" i then started telling myself things like , ' i 'll never weigh more than 200 pounds			1
then it became i 'll never weigh more than 250 , then 300 , then 350			2
then it became 400 , " @entity1 said			1
her mother , and then her partner , bought her clothes			2
she stopped weighing herself when she got to 389 pounds			1
she later realized she had even stopped looking in the mirror			2
" there was a window on a department store , and i remember seeing someone out of the corner of my eye and thinking ' who is that big fat person behind me ? ' it slowly dawned on me			2
" the surgery she decided she had to do something drastic			2
she looked into gastric bypass ; a friend had lost 110 pounds with the surgery			1
with gastric bypass , doctors create a small pouch at the top of your stomach and bypass the rest to send food straight to the small intestine			1
the walnut - sized pouch can only hold about an ounce of food			1
" right when i was thinking about it , i got a call from a friend who said that woman had passed , " @entity1 said			1
" i put the surgery off			2
i was n't losing my life over it			1
" three years ago , she worked up the nerve to look into it again			2
her insurance covered a program at @entity107			2
it started on the right note with a lecture from the physician who would do her surgery			2
he said he had done 2,000 surgeries and had no fatalities			0
he was also from @entity116 , which is where @entity1 grew up			1
" i took that as a sign that it was going to be ok , " she said			0
in august 2012 , she had surgery			0
the first two weeks were n't bad			1
she did n't mind the liquid , high - protein diet			1
she soon graduated to eating small quantities			0
but then she slipped into an old habit			0
she was running late on the way to the gym			0
she stopped at a drive - thru			0
after one bite she threw up			0
that 's when she gave up fast food for good			1
by the time she went back to work in october she was down to 280 pounds			1
" none of the clothes i had fit , so i posted that on @entity134 and people started giving me clothes in vast quantities			0
people were so incredibly supportive			0
" they were also confused			0
" it 's funny , when people hear that you have had gastric bypass , it 's almost like they think you 've had liposuction and had the fat removed , but that 's not the case , " @entity1 said			1
" a lot of what helps you lose weight afterward are all the changes you have to make			0
" she eats five or six small meals a day and takes advantage of @entity4 's reputation as an inventive mecca for foodies			0
she now enjoys fresh vegetables from the farmer 's market or a new take on a classic @entity161 dish			0
she 'll eat anything baked , broiled or grilled			0
she eats slowly to enjoy the taste and the smell and the quality			0
and if she does get a craving , she 'll eat a tiny amount of something rather than the entire container			0
" i bought a quart of vanilla ice cream when i moved into my place a year ago , and it is still there , " @entity1 said			1
setting exercise goals did , too			0
her step counter reminds her to get at least 10,000 steps each day			0
and she did n't just join one gym , she joined two			1
a 24 - hour facility by her house in @entity182 and a gym right down the street from work in @entity4			0
" since that one is a lot of money , it motivates me to go every day , " @entity1 said			1
" and it feels like a treat			0
i feel like a woman of luxury on the scene			0
" socializing now is about activity , rather than food			1
she takes walks with friends and plays basketball with her son			0
she plays tennis and swims			0
when she does dine out she looks at the menu online and decides what healthy option to have ahead of time so she 's not tempted			0
she cuts her meal into a smaller portion and takes the leftovers home			0
the true transformation the 5 - foot - 11 - inch woman is down to 179 pounds			1
her goal used to be 190			0
" i feel good , and i feel healthy , " @entity1 said			1
her sleep apnea equipment and high blood pressure medicine are gone			1
her lower back and joint pain disappeared			0
and she takes the time to celebrate what she calls the @entity218 : the little non-scale victories			0
signing up for a charity walk , she relished when the staff insisted she take a medium t - shirt rather than her request for " the largest size you have			0
" she tucks in her shirt now , showing off her waist			0
she has even started to date			0
and finally , after all these years , she looks in the mirror			0
" i 've never felt good about myself , about my looks			0
now i feel like i could attract someone			0
my friend from college jokes that it is time i should be in a lesbian power couple , but really now i just want someone who can hold their own with me in this world			0
" i finally see that i 'm worth it			0
