-- confusion reigns in @entity2 after stunning court rulings threw the country 's awkward transition toward democratic rule into turmoil			1
the decision sparked cries that @entity2 's military leaders have engineered a " soft coup " to thwart their longtime foes -- islamists who just four months ago captured a majority of seats in the @entity2 parliament in the first election in @entity2 in generations			1
the court 's decision dissolves parliament , and the military was quick to say it now controls legislative affairs in @entity2 , actions that raised the prospect of renewed mass street protests			1
the dizzying developments sent shock waves across @entity2 just 16 months after a popular uprising toppled former president @entity29 and two days before @entity2 go to the polls to elect a new president			1
they also raised fresh questions among many about whether the military -- long the most powerful force in @entity2 life -- would ever yield power			1
" @entity2 is entering into a very dangerous stage , and i think a lot of people were caught by surprise , " said @entity39 , director of research at the @entity41			1
" we knew it was getting bad , but we did n't think it was getting this bad			0
" he called the court rulings the " worst possible outcome " for @entity2 and said the transition to civilian rule was " effectively over			1
" in one ruling thursday , the @entity54 found that the rules governing january 's parliamentary elections were invalid , triggering the dissolution of parliament			1
in the second , the court rejected a law barring former regime members from running for president , clearing the way for @entity66 , the last prime minister under former @entity29 , to run in this weekend 's runoff election			1
he faces @entity68 , an @entity69 candidate favored by many in the @entity71 and their allies and supporters			0
the military leadership , the @entity74 , also announced it would name a 100 - strong panel by friday that will draw up a new constitution for the country			2
the moves came only hours after a decree was issued giving the military extended powers of arrest over civilians			2
that decree ushered in de facto martial law , observers said , just two weeks after many @entity2 celebrated the demise of a decades - old emergency law that gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charge			1
@entity93 , a fellow at the @entity94 , characterized the situation as a " soft coup in @entity2			1
" what is the @entity71 ? the military leadership 's action " really signals it 's moving very sharply against the political process , " @entity93 said			1
its actions are also piling on the pressure on the @entity71 , the @entity69 group whose political arm , the @entity107 , is headed by @entity68 , he said			0
" the question is whether that 's going to lead the @entity71 to up its own confrontation with the military or whether the @entity71 will use it as an opportunity to seek some kind of accord with the military , " he said			1
right now , the military and the @entity71 have ongoing conversations , but it is not yet clear what they may produce , @entity93 said			2
the @entity71 could seek a deal where @entity68 is made prime minister if @entity66 wins the presidency , he said			0
but if the @entity71 commits itself to confrontation in the form of street protests -- thereby threatening a second revolution -- that could be a game - changing situation , @entity93 said			2
experts are watching to see whether the decision reignites the huge street demonstrations that drove @entity29 from power in february 2011			1
it 's not yet clear whether ordinary @entity2 , many of whom are exhausted by the long months of uncertainty , will consider the ruling an attempt by the ruling elite to snuff out the promise of democracy fought for in @entity141			1
the real obstacle to democracy in @entity2 analysts say the @entity54 is considered partial to the regime headed by @entity29 , in which the military played a pivotal role -- and its perceived failure to maintain judicial independence could spark renewed anger			1
" essentially , no , the court is not neutral , " said @entity152 , a senior fellow for @entity153 at the @entity154			2
" it is very much part of the old regime			0
i think you are going to see people pouring into the streets and demand change			0
" one young @entity165 woman outside the court expressed the frustration felt by many protesters			2
" @entity74 has been suppressing our protests , suppressing the youth movements on the ground , they have been arresting thousands of us , " she said , referring to the @entity74			0
but @entity174 , who was a foreign minister under @entity29 , was chief of the @entity175 , and most recently a presidential candidate , played down the impact of the ruling on parliament			2
" it is not a political move or a decision by the @entity74 , it is a legal matter that has been referred to the tribunal , by individuals , by other parties , " he told @entity0 's @entity180			2
as for the wrangling over who will write the new constitution , @entity174 said it is not of crucial importance			0
" the current constitutional declaration is enough to give the president the powers he needs , " he said			0
" i believe that the president , once elected , knows exactly the powers he will use			0
" photos : a look back at @entity2 's uprisings following the court decision , @entity2 's interim military rulers declared full legislative authority , creating anxiety and uncertainty about the country 's future			1
it was just on january 23 -- two days before the anniversary of the birth of a revolution that eventually toppled @entity29 -- when the military surrendered legislative powers to the first parliament in the country 's history to be dominated by @entity69 , whose two parties won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house			1
the military is considered by many to be a bulwark against the power and influence of @entity69 in @entity2			1
and some who fear the @entity71 has gained too much strength may welcome this knock to the confidence built from its successes in the parliamentary vote			0
" with parliamentary elections , there was this sense that the @entity71 could now go for broke , " @entity152 said			0
" they seem to have been outmaneuvered by the military and courts and associated supporters of the old regime			2
it may be time to make a deal to preserve themselves to fight longer			0
" all eyes will be on the conduct and outcome of the runoff this weekend			0
taken together , the military leadership 's actions indicate " there 's a high likelihood of @entity66 being aided to victory by the military , " @entity93 said			1
but @entity251 , a professor at @entity252 , told @entity180 that people are " very confused " and split over who to back			0
" @entity66 made a very powerful speech today , he tried to calm many people , " he said			0
" but there is a lot of sympathy i think now for the @entity71 -- there 's a lot of fear of what @entity66 is capable of doing			0
" and because things now have become so clear and the gloves are off , people see what the military is intent on doing			0
yesterday 's ruling by the minister of justice giving the military police these excessive rights , this is a serious militarization of @entity2 society , that we made the revolution against			1
" @entity251 said he believes blunders by the @entity71 are partly to blame for its current weakened position			0
the @entity71 has failed to get results in parliament , where its lawmakers have been " cocky " toward liberal forces , he said , and also failed to realize just how deep the military 's influence runs through @entity2 's intelligence and security services -- the so - called deep state			1
the " legal coup " pulled off by the military is just the latest front in a long - running battle for dominance between the two sides , he said			2
" this has been in the offing for not only months , but for years and years , " @entity251 said			0
" the events of today and indeed the past few weeks have shown very clearly the determination by @entity74 to oust the @entity71 altogether , and to deny it serious victories that it had won legitimately through by ballot boxes -- and today is the culmination of that struggle			0
" are you there ? share photos and videos with us on @entity310			0
a wild election weekend for @entity2 , @entity312 and @entity313 @entity29 clings to life in @entity165 hospital saving the sound of the @entity317			2

renewed street demonstrations could be in @entity2 's near future , experts say
high court ruling dissolves new parliament , further *empowering* the military
