@entity0 -- the @entity2 on wednesday abandoned plans to allow small knives and certain other banned items back on passenger flights , surrendering to fierce criticism from airlines , unions and @entity10			1
in a statement , the @entity2 said it would continue to enforce the " current prohibited items list , " which does not permit small knives			1
the @entity2 first announced the plan to allow small knives and sporting equipment in march , saying doing so would permit airport screeners extra time to focus on more dangerous objects like bombs and related components			1
the change would also have brought the @entity24 into alignment with rules governing flights in most other countries , he said			1
aviation safety experts said small knives and sports equipment present little threat to aircraft , largely because of the reinforced cockpit doors			1
authorities say terrorists continue to plot against airlines			2
but the threat response has shifted away from any effort to take control of a plane , like the 9/11 hijackers did , as carriers have hardened cockpits and beefed up on board and ground security			0
knives are among the most common items surrendered by passengers at screening points at @entity24 airports , figures show			0
but aviation safety experts say small knives and sports equipment present little threat to aircraft			1
the emphasis now is on detecting bombs			0
@entity2 administrator @entity59 previously said " our greatest concern , the greatest risk " is non-metalic improvised explosive devices , or ieds			1
" that 's what i want our security officers to focus on , " he said			0
but his effort to roll back the small knife ban to allow unfixed blades no longer than 2.36 inches and less than a half - inch wide was met with sharp and sustained criticism from big airlines			1
groups representing flight attendants , pilots , and airport screeners also were not convinced that the security situation warranted a change			0
numerous members of @entity10 balked at the plan as well , some promising to fight it legislatively			1
@entity2 pulled back three days before the change was to take effect in april , saying it wanted to consult with key groups before moving forward			1
@entity2 officially abandoned the effort on wednesday			2
" @entity2 strongly values the input of our partners and traveling public and appreciates the varying points of view shared throughout the review process , " it said in its statement			2
it made the final decision " after extensive engagement " with aviation advisers , law enforcement officials , and passenger advocates , the agency said			0
some @entity101 supporters , including former @entity2 chief @entity102 , argued the knife ban actually endangers passengers by re-focusing the attention of airport screeners away from bigger threats			1
but that opinion held little sway with flight attendants , who said they would be " sitting ducks " for any passenger armed with weapons			0
" we promised ' no knives on planes ever again ' and today that promise was kept , " the @entity114 said in a statement			0
it commended the agency for revising its plans			0
" the result is better security policy and the assurance that our nation 's aviation security system continues to be vigilant for knives that could be used in a terrorist attack or criminal act against passengers or crew , " the group that represents 90,000 flight attendants said			0
the @entity2 has made numerous changes to its list of prohibiting items over the years			2
it now permits small screwdrivers , small scissors , cigarette lighters and matches , and bans large quantities of liquids and gels			0
rep. @entity145 of @entity146 , the top @entity147 on the @entity148 , applauded the @entity2 decision			2
" when established processes for creating policy are followed , common sense prevails , " he said .			0
