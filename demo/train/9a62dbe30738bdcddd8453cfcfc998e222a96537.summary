@entity1 , @entity0 -- opposition boycotts marred the swearing - in ceremony of @entity0 's newly elected parliament on tuesday			1
the contentious session took place less than three weeks after @entity0 's incumbent @entity8 , or @entity8 , won a resounding victory in national elections			1
led by two - term prime minister @entity12 , the party captured 327 seats in the 550 - member body			0
but the main @entity17 nationalist party and the largest secularist opposition party both objected after they saw several of their newly elected candidates barred from entering parliament			1
more than 30 lawmakers from the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) boycotted tuesday 's session			2
they protested a decision by @entity0 's electoral board last week , which disqualified @entity17 candidate @entity27 for " not meeting the requirements for being elected into parliament			1
" the board cited @entity32 's 20 - month prison sentence after he was convicted of " making propaganda for a terrorist organization , " @entity0 official - speak for the separatist rebel group known as the @entity36 , or @entity36			0
the electoral board replaced the disqualified @entity17 candidate with the runner - up , a member of the ruling political party			2
the replacement @entity8 candidate was sworn into parliament on tuesday			0
meanwhile , @entity17 lawmakers protested by gathering hundreds of miles away from the capital , @entity48 , in the southeastern city of @entity50 on tuesday			1
" to show that we do not approve this intervention in democratic politics , we will continue our ' not going to parliament ' approach until a solution can be found , " said @entity51 , one of the @entity17 party 's parliament members , in a phone call with @entity2			1
lawmakers from the much larger @entity60 , or @entity60 , attended the parliament meeting in the @entity0 capital			1
but almost all of the @entity60 parliament members symbolically protested , by refusing to participate in the swearing - in ceremony			2
we " will not be a part of a group who do not allow elected parliamentarians to take the oath , " said @entity60 leader @entity66 on tuesday			2
" with this principle and belief in democracy , we as @entity60 parliamentarians will not take the oath until the right of those who have been elected to take the oath is restored			2
" @entity66 referred to two @entity60 members who won elections on the party 's ballot from jail , where they are awaiting trial as suspects in a sprawling investigation into an alleged coup to overthrow the @entity0 government			1
the inauspicious opening of parliament could complicate prime minister @entity12 's much - publicized plans to rewrite @entity0 's constitution			0
@entity12 will need support from two - thirds of the sitting lawmakers , at least 330 members of the 550 - person body , to take a new draft of the constitution to a popular referendum			0
the dispute also highlights @entity0 's long - simmering ethnic conflict			0
more than 30,000 people , mostly @entity17 , have been killed during fighting between the @entity36 and the @entity0 state since the early 1980s			0
on sunday , tear gas wafted through the heart of the commercial capital of @entity1 after police clashed with @entity17 activists			0
and on monday , a @entity0 soldier was killed and three troops wounded in a suspected @entity36 attack in near the eastern border city of @entity117 , the semi-official @entity112 reported .			0
