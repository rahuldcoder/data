@entity0 -- days before the one - year anniversary of the raid that killed @entity4 , top surrogates for president @entity6 and presumptive @entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 took to the national stage to argue the politics of the attack			1
senior @entity6 campaign adviser @entity12 defended the campaign 's use of the event in a recent web video and in a speech from vice president @entity18			1
meanwhile , senior @entity7 adviser @entity19 characterized the political steps surrounding the death as a " bridge too far			1
" @entity23 released a video on friday , partially narrated by former president @entity25 , that praised the president 's decision to order the killing of the @entity30 chief one year from tuesday and questioned whether @entity7 would have made the same choice			1
@entity18 similarly questioned the former @entity33 governor in a campaign - style speech on thursday			1
@entity12 , the former @entity35 press secretary , said the video was " not over the line " and criticized comments @entity7 made on the issue during his first @entity35 bid as " foolish			1
" the video quotes @entity7 in 2007 during his first @entity35 bid , saying , " it 's not worth moving heaven and earth , spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person			1
" days later , he said , " we 'll move everything to get him ( @entity4 )			0
" " there 's a difference in the roles they would play as commander in chief , and i certainly think that 's fair game , " @entity12 said sunday on @entity49 's " @entity48			0
" during his second @entity35 bid , @entity7 has repeatedly praised the president for launching the raid on @entity4			1
@entity19 , a former aide to former president @entity60 and former chairman of the @entity62 , said utilizing the raid for political purposes is one of the reasons @entity6 has " become one of the most divisive presidents in @entity70 history			2
" " he took something that was a unifying event for all @entity70 , and he 's managed to turn it into a divisive , partisan political attack , " @entity19 said in a separate interview on the same @entity49 program			0
" i think most @entity70 will see it as a sign of a desperate campaign			0
" the day @entity4 died the campaign video received criticism from @entity8 , including from 2008 @entity8 presidential nominee sen. @entity80			1
on friday , he called the minute - long spot " a cheap political attack ad			0
" @entity35 counterterrorism adviser @entity83 avoided the politics of the issue but did praise the president 's decision - making skills surrounding @entity4 's death by @entity90 during a raid in @entity92			1
" i do n't do politics , " @entity83 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity93			0
" " i just know that president @entity6 , when the time came for him to make a momentous decision like that , he took the action that did bring @entity4 to justice			1
" @entity18 teed off what will likely remain a talking point from @entity23 through the election in a thursday address that previewed a potential 2012 slogan			0
" if you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how president @entity6 has handled what we inherited , it 's pretty simple : @entity4 is dead and @entity115 is alive , " @entity18 said during a speech at @entity114 , lines @entity12 echoed on sunday			1
the president will pick up the message with what the campaign has billed as the president 's re-election kick - off on saturday			0
@entity6 is expected to attend campaign rallies in @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127 , @entity128 , two likely battleground states in the november election			1
@entity18 will attend campaign events in @entity131 and @entity132 on monday and in @entity0 on thursday			1
@entity6 rallied young voters on college campuses in @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 last week , calling for @entity138 to stop an increase in the interest rate for student loans in july			0
@entity142 , @entity6 campaign manager , said that saturday will mark the end of the @entity8 " monologue			1
" " now @entity7 has to put his record and his agenda up against the president 's , and we look forward to that debate , " @entity142 said wednesday on a conference call with reporters			2
@entity7 is expected to meet with former @entity8 presidential candidate @entity152 on friday , a long - awaited rendezvous given that the former @entity155 senator has yet to endorse his party 's presumptive nominee			1
@entity152 danced around the issue last week with @entity1 's @entity159 during his first televised interview since he suspended his candidacy on april 10			2
he acknowledged @entity7 would be the " person that 's going against @entity6 , " but said he was still " working through it " and discussing it with this wife , @entity165			1
@entity167 is scheduled to announce the suspension of his campaign on wednesday , at which point he will back @entity7 , sources told @entity1			2
@entity171 expected to end his run wednesday @entity7 will spend much of the coming week fundraising , with events in @entity155 and @entity128			2
he will also campaign monday with sen. @entity175 of @entity176 , the latest potential vice presidential candidate to appear with the @entity8 frontrunner			1
the freshman senator was an early backer of @entity7 and appeared with him repeatedly on the stump ahead of her state 's primary			2
sen. @entity183 of @entity184 got the vp scrutiny treatment last week when he appeared with @entity7 in @entity155			2
many political observers see @entity183 as the favorite for @entity7 's vice presidential pick , given his ties to the swing state of @entity184 , the @entity193 community ( he is the son of @entity195 immigrants ) and members of the grassroots tea party movement			2
@entity183 was one of three potential candidates mentioned by @entity35 speaker @entity199 in an interview that aired sunday on @entity1 's " @entity93			0
" @entity199 said there is a " long list " of qualified candidates for the @entity8 ticket , including @entity183 , sen. @entity205 of @entity126 and gov. @entity206 of @entity132 , all of whom fit his criteria that the pick be capable of serving as president			2
" there are a lot of people that i like			0
but this is a personal choice for gov. @entity7 , and i 'm confident that he 'll have a running mate that will be helpful to the ticket , " @entity199 told @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity216			0
" i think the number one quality is : are they capable of being president in the case of an emergency ? " @entity227 mayor @entity226 of @entity228 and @entity229 , former @entity230 governor and @entity62 chairman , on sunday downplayed the importance of the no. 2 pick			0
@entity226 , a @entity234 , said he would n't expect a @entity183 pick to make a large difference with @entity193 voters			0
" i do n't expect that it 's going to win you an election or win you an entire demographic			0
this is going to be fought on the issues , " @entity226 said on @entity241 ' " @entity244			0
" " can a vice presidential candidate just change the whole deck ? no i do n't think so , " @entity229 said on the @entity241 program			0
" the idea that you 're going to reshuffle the deck would be very unusual in @entity70 history			0
