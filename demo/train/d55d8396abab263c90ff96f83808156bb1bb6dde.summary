-- @entity1 is clamping down on triclosan , an ingredient used in some toothpastes , cosmetics , antibacterial soaps and body washes			1
gov. @entity8 recently signed a bill legalizing a measure banning triclosan - containing products in the state			1
the law will go into effect january 1 , 2017			2
" in order to prevent the spread of infectious disease and avoidable infections and to promote best practices in sanitation , no person shall offer for retail sale in @entity1 any cleaning product that contains triclosan and is used by consumers for sanitizing or hand and body cleansing , " the law says			1
the exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the @entity33 for consumer use			2
@entity35 has been incorporated in consumer products for more than 30 years , according to the @entity37			1
a @entity37 study found triclosan present in the urine of 75 % of the people tested			1
the health effects of triclosan for humans are still unclear			1
some studies suggest that the chemical could be linked to antibiotic resistance , but evidence is mixed , and the @entity49 says more research is needed to evaluate risk			0
there is some evidence that long - term exposure to some ingredients in antibacterial products , including triclosan , " could pose health risks , such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects , " according to the @entity33			1
studies in rats have shown a decrease in thyroid hormones with long - term exposure to triclosan , dr. @entity60 , deputy director of the @entity61 in @entity33 's @entity62 , told @entity0 in december			2
but collecting data from humans is " very difficult " because the studies have to look at a long time period			0
the @entity33 announced a proposed rule in december that would require manufacturers of antibacterial hand soap and body wash to prove their products are more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of infection			0
if the rule goes into effect , those manufacturers also will be required to prove their products are safe for long - term use			2
" millions of @entity87 use antibacterial hand soap and body wash products , " the agency said in a statement			0
" although consumers generally view these products as effective tools to help prevent the spread of germs , there is currently no evidence that they are any more effective at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water			0
" about 2,000 individual products contain such chemicals , health officials said			2
the @entity33 first proposed removing triclosan from certain products in 1978 , according to the @entity105 , " but because the agency took no final action , triclosan has been found in more and more soaps			1
" in 2010 , the @entity105 said it sued the @entity33 to force it to issue a final rule			0
the new proposed rule stems from a settlement in that suit , according to the group			0
most hand sanitizers have 60 % alcohol or ethanol and are generally recognized as safe when water is n't available , @entity60 said			0
however , health officials still believe washing hands with soap and water is the best method .			0
