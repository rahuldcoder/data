@entity0 -- hundreds of @entity3 police swarmed a makeshift @entity5 protest camp early sunday morning , taking dozens of activists into custody for questioning before releasing them later			1
the operation marked the latest saga in the bitter back - and - forth over @entity3 's settlement activity in the @entity0			1
the camp , which protesters dubbed @entity14 , sprung up thursday , in a roughly 12 - square kilometer ( 5 - square mile ) area @entity3 has dubbed @entity16			2
in recent weeks , @entity3 has signaled its intention to construct settlements in the area			1
some international leaders have criticized such a plan , as have @entity5 leaders who say it would slice the @entity0 in two , cutting it off from the proposed @entity5 capital of @entity25			1
@entity26 : inside @entity3 's planned settlement mid-day friday , @entity3 authorities gave the protesters 24 hours to leave the site , according to @entity3 police spokesman @entity32			1
@entity3 's high court issued an order for the activists ' evacuation late saturday night			1
" the notices were given out to all the activists here that they were trespassing , " @entity32 said			0
shortly after midnight , more than 500 police officers descended on @entity14 to carry out the evacuation order			2
more than 60 protesters were taken into custody			2
around 5 a.m. sunday ( 10 p.m. et saturday ) , all those detained had been released , said activist @entity46			0
six protesters were injured when officers punched them in the face , according to the @entity51 , the organizers of the @entity14 protest camp			0
" even though we were evicted , our strength was apparent since the police needed hundreds and hundreds of special unit police officers , " the organizers said			0
" this is not the end of the popular struggle and it will continue in its full strength			0
" @entity32 denied there were injuries			0
" people were taken out carefully one by one , " he said			0
the protest camp -- consisting of chanting activists and tents dotting an otherwise barren hilltop -- sprung up due to @entity3 's recently announced plans to build 3,000 housing units in @entity25 and the @entity0			1
construction in the @entity16 would be an expansion of @entity74 , one of @entity3 's largest @entity0 settlements which already has about 40,000 people			1
" we are taking back this area , that is private @entity5 land , and building our own village , " said activist @entity78			1
" we can just look over ( at other @entity3 settlements ) and see what this land might potentially look like , if we do n't actually ( take ) things into our own hands			2
" @entity74 's mayor @entity88 has cheered this possibility , saying , " this place , this residential neighborhood , it is in the @entity74 municipality , part of ... government land			0
" but many internationally have condemned further expansion of @entity3 settlements in the @entity0 , of which there are 137 ( with about 325,000 residents ) , according to the settlement monitoring group @entity103			1
numerous countries -- including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 -- summoned @entity3 's ambassador to hear criticism of the decision , announced late last year , to move forward with the settlement plans			2
@entity3 defies international criticism of settlement plans the @entity5 ' chief negotiator @entity118 said such a settlement will dash any hopes of a " two - state solution " -- with @entity3 and an independent @entity5 nation , living together in peace			1
" there is no chance for a @entity5 state , " @entity118 has said			0
" anyone who looks at the map , looks at the geography will know exactly that this decision means there is no more two - state solution			0
" @entity1 's @entity133 reported this story from the @entity0 and @entity135 wrote it from @entity136			0
@entity1 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
