-- after reviewing the case of a woman who died at @entity4 , @entity6 's @entity5 in the days after @entity7 , coroner @entity1 said thursday that he can not classify her death as a homicide			1
@entity1 said he hopes his findings on the death of @entity12 , 79 , will mark " the end of the @entity5 hurricane situation			1
" the review was initiated after an august 2009 @entity17 article quoted a doctor as saying @entity5 patients were given morphine and other drugs after @entity7 struck in august 2005 , with hospital staff knowing that it could hasten some of the patients ' deaths			1
@entity12 ' manner of death is unclassified , the coroner said , and the cause of her death undetermined			1
" i do n't think -- and i could be wrong -- i do n't think the morphine contributed as much to her demise as her physical condition , " said @entity1 , who 's served as the coroner of @entity4 since 1974			1
" this patient was extremely sick , " @entity1 said of @entity12			1
the woman had had surgery a week before and had been on " morphine around the clock			2
she 'd had kidney failure			0
she 'd had liver failure			0
" she also had developed sepsis , or blood poisoning , he said			0
@entity12 was being treated for advanced uterine cancer and kidney failure , according to the @entity46			1
dr. @entity47 told the @entity17 that he asked a nurse to increase @entity12 ' morphine and give her " enough until she goes			1
" " if you do n't think that by giving a person a lot of morphine , you 're not prematurely sending them to their grave , then you 're a very naive doctor , " @entity47 told the @entity17			1
" we kill ' em. " on @entity12 , he said , " i gave her medicine so i could get rid of her faster , get the nurses off the floor			1
" he added , " there 's no question i hastened her demise			0
" in response to a @entity17 - @entity46 report in september , @entity4 district attorney @entity68 said he planned to look into the deaths but stopped short of calling it an investigation			1
@entity1 said thursday that he had delivered a detailed report to @entity68 on wednesday			0
because she had been receiving morphine , @entity12 had naturally developed some tolerance to it , @entity1 said			1
he also took her weight , 240 pounds , into account			0
@entity12 had received seven 15 - milligram shots of morphine and died 3Â½ hours after receiving the last one , he said			1
deaths from morphine , or any narcotic , tend to happen immediately , he said			2
@entity1 said he believes that @entity12 ' blood poisoning , along with anemia she had before her surgery , mostly contributed to her death			1
" i 'm saying ' mostly ' because we really do n't know , " he said			2
" and when you really do n't know , you have to be 100 percent sure " when calling a death a homicide			2
he said he does n't believe that @entity12 received enough morphine to kill her			1
@entity1 said thursday that when he told @entity12 ' relatives about his findings , " they were very polite			1
" he said they will come in to speak with him soon			0
@entity7 roared ashore near the @entity100 - @entity6 state line on august 29 , 2005 , rupturing three of @entity4 ' protective levees and putting about three - quarters of the city under water			1
@entity105 , who was then the state attorney general , launched an investigation after officials from @entity108 , an acute - care facility operating on the seventh floor of @entity5 , reported allegations that several seriously ill , mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at @entity5 as the floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated			1
in 2006 , @entity105 ordered the arrest of dr. @entity118 and two nurses , @entity120 and @entity121 , on preliminary charges of second - degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients			2
former @entity4 district attorney @entity126 , who under @entity6 law was responsible for prosecuting crimes , gave @entity129 and @entity131 immunity in exchange for their testimony			2
in july 2007 , a grand jury refused to indict @entity118			0
@entity105 said his investigation revealed that the four patients were given a " lethal cocktail " of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , both central nervous system depressants			2
the patients were 63 , 68 , 91 and 93 , he said			2
@entity118 , @entity131 and @entity120 denied the charges , and their attorneys said they acted heroically , staying to treat patients rather than evacuate			2
in an interview with @entity147 in 2007 , @entity118 admitted giving the patients drugs			0
" if in doing so it hastened their deaths , then that 's what happened , " she said			0
" but this was not ' i 'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people			0
' we 're here to help patients			0
" the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised @entity105 that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after @entity7 struck			0
all five were brought in by @entity105 's office to analyze the deaths and concluded that the patients were homicide victims			0
after the grand jury refused to indict @entity118 , @entity126 called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it			0
@entity0 and the @entity46 have filed suit seeking the release of @entity177 's investigative file into the deaths			0
@entity0 was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia , six weeks after the hurricane			0
the case went to the @entity183 , which in july sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal charges in the case are reasonably anticipated			0
no new trial date has been set , @entity188 , the @entity4 attorney representing the media organization , said thursday			2
hospital workers identified only as @entity192 and @entity193 have sued to block the file 's release , claiming that the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules , that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy .			0
