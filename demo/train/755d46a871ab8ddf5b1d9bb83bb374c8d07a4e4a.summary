@entity0 -- the @entity2 , the giant @entity3 , and now the @entity4 of @entity5			1
once again , culture is under attack			1
militants from the @entity10 group , which controls much of northern @entity11 , have started to destroy @entity5 's ancient tombs			1
in three days , half of the town 's shrines have been destroyed in a display of fanaticism			1
in rebel hands since january , @entity5 has been taken beyond the pale			1
@entity11 has gone from one of @entity22 's most stable democracies to a country gripped by chaos , where over 300,000 people have been uprooted			1
the destruction of @entity5 's shrines adds a moral and cultural crisis to a desperate humanitarian situation			1
these are not accidents , nor the unfortunate side effects of conflict			2
this destruction is deliberate , undertaken in cold blood to catch the world 's attention and destroy the last defenses of @entity11 identity and strength			1
this attack is led by a tiny armed minority , who violently imposes its interpretation of a faith on a distraught local community , spoiling centuries of tolerance and exchange			1
we must realize what is really going on			2
there is much more at stake than a handful of structures made of mud and wood -- as valuable as they are			0
@entity5 is no ordinary town			1
the fabled " @entity64 , " is an ancient desert crossroads and a historic seat of @entity62 learning and faith			0
the attack on @entity5 's cultural heritage is an attack against this history and the values it carries -- values of tolerance , exchange and living together , which lie at the heart of @entity62			1
it is an attack against the physical evidence that peace and dialogue is possible			1
this is condemned uniformly by religious leaders across the world			0
the @entity80 calls this a war crime			0
we call it an attack against humanity			1
this is an attempt to isolate and exclude , to sever the ties that bind peoples together			1
there is no justification for such a wanton destruction			2
beyond universal condemnation , we must act to protect our common heritage as one of our most precious assets to build peace and foster mutual understanding in a globalized world			0
@entity100 militants taking advantage of chaos in @entity11 protecting culture is not a luxury -- it is a security issue			0
attacks against cultural heritage are attacks against the very identity of communities			2
they lead to devastation that can be irreparable , with an impact that lasts long after the dust has settled			0
attacks on the past make reconciliation much harder in the future			0
we know also the power of @entity120 to bring together divided communities and promote international cooperation in difficult contexts			0
i saw this personally in south - east @entity126 , for instance , when @entity128 helped rebuild the @entity2 in @entity129 , destroyed during the war in the 1990s			0
@entity128 is also engaged today in restoration work in the @entity132 of @entity133			2
as globalization accelerates , people feel ever more the need to protect their identities and sense of belonging			0
culture has today a central role in peace building and conflict prevention			2
this is why it is such an easy target for fanatics			0
forty years ago , the world 's nations came together behind the @entity120 , inspired by the idea that we share a heritage that is universal and that draws all cultures together			2
fanatics across the planet will always try to counter this idea			0
these attacks call on us to renew our commitment to protect culture			0
just as 40 years ago , we need a new leap of global solidarity today , starting in @entity5			1
i call on all parties to stop these tragic and irreversible acts			0
i am mobilizing @entity128 fully to provide support to the government and people of @entity11			0
i have spoken to the leaders of the country and across the region and called on them to bring all the influence they have to help the people of @entity11 resolve the current crisis through dialogue .			2
