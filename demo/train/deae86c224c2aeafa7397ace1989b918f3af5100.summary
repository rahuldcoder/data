-- march 28 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 : disaster - affected areas @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : i 'm @entity17 and today , @entity0 shows you what it looks like when the lights go down in the city			1
but our journey through today 's headlines starts in @entity4			1
first up : @entity4 @entity25 @entity26 : and our first subject : who is leading the coalition military operation in that north @entity31 country			1
the @entity32 has been in charge			1
but a deal was worked out over the weekend for @entity35 , the @entity35 , to take responsibility for running the operation			2
the first part of that , @entity35 enforcing the no - fly zone over @entity4 , is scheduled to happen today			1
on the ground , @entity4 forces are fighting against rebels who want @entity4 's leader , colonel @entity44 , out of power			1
the rebels were pushing westward over the weekend and taking control of some key cities along the way			2
but in others , the fighting between rebels and military forces is fierce			2
president @entity53 is scheduled to give a speech tonight about the situation in @entity4			1
that 'll happen at 7:30 et. crisis in @entity5 @entity26 : over in @entity5 , we 're getting some conflicting reports about the radiation coming out of a damaged nuclear power plant			1
early sunday , tests showed that one building at the plant was giving off radiation levels 10 million times more than normal			1
@entity67 , which owns the plant , later said the number was closer to 100,000 times normal level			1
the problems at the plant started with the earthquake and tsunami that hit @entity5 a little over two weeks ago			1
in this @entity77 video , you can see the impact of that tsunami			2
the water is rushing over the barrier , flooding a road			2
then , it starts sweeping across a parking lot filled with cars			2
at this point , the flood is pouring in so fast you ca n't even see the barrier			2
and those cars are tossed around like toys in a tub , smashed up against the side of a building			2
this is how an entire town can be washed away			2
eventually , the force of the water , the force of the cars , one building is just ripped off its foundation and floats away			0
it might seem strange to talk about a @entity103 in relation to the crisis in @entity5			1
but the annual event in @entity107 highlights the relationship between the @entity32 and @entity5			1
and this year , people used the festival to show their support for victims halfway around the world			1
( begin video ) @entity115 , communications manager , @entity117 : we thought it was a really good time to bring everyone together in a show of solidarity and support for the people of @entity5 in this great time of need			1
@entity126 , @entity127 : this a very tough fight			0
but the consolation is that people around the world are trying to be with us			0
@entity133 , japanese - american : @entity103 , cherry blossom is always special for us			0
but this year , the @entity103 is very , very special			0
@entity5 people , we need to restore our country again			1
for that , we need a lot of support , especially @entity32 support			1
a hundred years ago , @entity5 people sent cherry blossoms to the @entity32			1
and after a hundred years , still blooming			0
and that represent our friendships			0
@entity146 , japanese - american : my mother is @entity5 , and i thought this is a good way to help support the efforts			1
my culture is really important to me , and i 'm really proud to be out here with everyone			0
@entity155 , japanese - american : i just want the people of @entity5 to know that the people of the @entity32 , from the bottom of their hearts , ordinary @entity32 truly and genuinely care for the @entity5 people			1
and i hope that message can be brought to them through this festival			1
( @entity164 ) @entity165 @entity166 , 1984 democratic vice presidential candidate : i want to thank @entity168 for asking the convention to nominate me as his running mate			0
this choice says a lot about him , about where the country has come , and about where we want to lead it			1
@entity168 called my road here , the classic @entity32 dream			1
@entity181 @entity26 : @entity166 , talking in 1984 about her nomination as the @entity32 @entity184 vice presidential candidate			1
@entity166 made history as the first female vp candidate from a major political party			0
her running mate , @entity168 , said he picked her because " she 's smart , she knows the issues , she believes in social justice			1
" @entity168 and @entity166 did n't win the election			0
but 10 years later , @entity166 was inducted into the @entity192 in recognition of her accomplishments and contributions to @entity32 society			1
@entity166 died on saturday from complications from blood cancer			0
she was 75 years old			0
@entity199 @entity26 : the name @entity201 might not sound very familiar to you , but it probably does to your parents and teachers			0
on this day in 1979 , @entity201 was the site of the most serious nuclear accident in @entity32 history			1
with the crisis going on in @entity5 , some people are asking about the safety of nuclear facilities in the @entity32 @entity212 is here to give us a tour of one			1
( begin video ) @entity217 , @entity218 : this is a rare look at the inner workings of a nuclear plant , this one owned by @entity219 , the @entity219 , at @entity220			1
they 're opening up this tour today because they want to reassure the public that what happened in @entity5 could not happen here			1
this nuclear plant was built to generate electricity the same way as the stricken @entity232 plant			1
but operators here say redundant layers of generators and batteries would keep the critical systems running after a catastrophe			0
this is a very interesting place right here			0
just step through right here and right below my feet is a thousand pounds of pressurized steam			0
i 'm standing right on top of one of the reactors			0
shutting it down in an emergency is easy			0
keeping the nuclear fuel from overheating , though , was a problem in @entity5			1
this is the pool where spent fuel rods are kept cool , just like the one that malfunctioned in the @entity5 plant			1
fire hoses are strung nearby to pump water into the pool manually if all systems fail			0
@entity262 , @entity263 : you can never in our business say ever , positively , because i think the @entity5 may have said the same thing			1
but i 'll tell you , i do n't believe we 're going to have a 43 - foot high wall of water that 's going to hit this interior plant inside in the state of @entity7			1
@entity274 : this big red area is a huge reservoir of water that sits underneath the reactor			0
the water in here is then pumped into the reactor in emergency situations			0
what i want to show you is right here , that piece of metal right there that looks like a shock absorber for your car			2
that 's a shock absorber for this reactor			2
it 's called a snubber , and it goes into operation in case there 's an earthquake			2
this plant is designed to withstand a 6.0 earthquake and a million - year flood on the @entity301			2
one big change after watching what happened in @entity5 : operators of this plant and others are going back to the drawing board to decide if they have figured out what is their worst - case scenario			1
they 'll be playing a very long game of " what if " to determine if they 've got it right			0
@entity315 , @entity0 , @entity316 , @entity7			0
( @entity164 ) blog report @entity26 : our blog asked what you thought of a @entity324 school 's rules to accommodate a student with a life - threatening peanut allergy			2
if you have n't seen that report , you can find friday 's show			1
it 's in our archive at @entity331			2
@entity332 says " the rules go overboard			0
the student should be homeschooled ; her parents are making the whole school go through a lot of hassle			0
" @entity339 calls protesting the new rules " petty			0
" he ca n't believe some parents refuse to suffer the minor inconveniences mentioned to protect the welfare of a young girl			0
the results of our quick poll : 44 percent of you called the new rules appropriate ; 56 percent said they go too far			0
@entity351 says " the child deserves to be safe at school			0
the regulations on her classmates should be seen as compassion , not an inconvenience			0
" @entity358 asks " why other people have to be responsible for another child 's health issue , " and says her sister has the same problem and was taught early how to handle it herself			2
perspective from @entity366 : " think about how the allergic girl must be feeling			0
all these new rules because of her -- that must be embarrassing			0
" before we go @entity26 : our last story today is a dark one , but for a good reason			2
it 's @entity375 ! cities around the world flipped the switch this past saturday , turning off their lights for one hour at 8:30 p.m. the event started a few years ago in @entity381			2
it 's designed to raise awareness about environmental issues			2
last year , more than 100 countries participated			0
if you want to get involved with all this , you better be serious about going dark			0
goodbye @entity26 : because once you 've committed to @entity375 , you ca n't black out			0
a little pun to lighten the mood			0
that story was lights out ! and so are we			0
we 'll see you tomorrow .			0
