@entity0 -- the @entity2 ruled for agribusiness giant @entity3 on monday in a patent case that could have an enormous impact on a variety of biotech fields			1
the justices unanimously found the world 's largest seed producer has intellectual property control over its best - selling " @entity13 " soybeans			2
that means the product can not be reproduced without paying the company a fee			0
products like genetically engineered seeds and live vaccines have been hailed as scientific and industrial breakthroughs , but they often can be reproduced easily and cheaply			1
@entity3 sued an @entity23 farmer , @entity22 , claiming he violated a farming agreement when he used genetic copies of the company 's soybean product without paying a " technology fee			1
" @entity3 claimed that the seeds could only be used for one growing season , meaning their offspring could not be saved and replanted without compensation			1
" @entity22 planted @entity3 's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article , " said justice @entity34			1
the high court is deciding a separate case on whether human genes can be patented			1
@entity3 dominates the soybean seed market			1
its @entity13 variety is used to grow about 90 percent of the nation 's crop for the estimated 275,000 @entity50 soybean farmers like @entity22 , according to its petition			2
the company 's scientists perfected a system in 1996 for injecting genes into seeds that are resistant to the herbicide roundup			2
this allowed farmers to plant with reduced risk of weeds , insects , and disease			0
those soybeans cost more and farmers must agree not to replant their progeny , thus buying seeds each year			2
the corporation says it has sued 146 @entity50 farmers including @entity22			2
eleven cases have gone to trial and @entity3 won them all			1
@entity22 grows corn , wheat , and soybeans on 300 acres in @entity74 , @entity23			1
he used the patented soybeans for his main spring crop , but went to a local grain elevator and purchased so - called commodity seeds for a riskier , late - season crop			1
such soybeans are typically used for feed livestock and for milling , but not for replanting			0
but @entity22 said there were no restrictions on how he used the mixed - variety seeds , which he did for eight consecutive fall crops			1
the company found out and sued him six years ago was awarded more than $ 84,000 in damages			2
lower courts said the second - generation seed planting was a " newly infringing article			0
" @entity91 , @entity22 's attorney , said farmers take all the risks when they plant , while the company can sit back and control how its products are used in perpetuity			0
" if exhaustion [ first - sale doctrine ] is eliminated , rather , for the progeny seed , then you are taking away the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in commerce , " he told the court during february oral arguments			0
" you have essentially a servitude on these things that are exchanged and every grain elevator who makes a sale is infringing , " he said			0
food safety experts have raised concerns about the proliferation of genetically engineered food products , saying such production technologies can prove harmful			0
but @entity3 , backed by the @entity119 administration and a range of businesses , say protecting intellectual property is more important than ever , especially in fast - developing technological fields			1
" @entity50 's leadership in fostering the incentive to invest in research and development has created the world 's leading innovation economy , with millions of high - technology jobs - not just in our field of agriculture , but in other r&d - intensive fields like medicine , biotechnology , computer science and environmental science , " said @entity124 , @entity3 's general counsel			1
@entity22 argued the soybeans naturally replicate or sprout themselves and had done so without much input from him			0
but @entity34 , writing for her eight colleagues , was not convinced			0
" we think that blame - the - bean defense tough to credit , " she said			0
" in all this , the bean surely figured			0
but it was @entity22 , and not the bean , who controlled the reproduction ( to the eighth generation ) of @entity3 's patented invention			1
" but @entity34 also issued a measure of caution , saying this decision might not necessarily apply in other areas			0
" our holding today is limited -- addressing the situation before us , rather than every one involving a self - replicating product , " she said			0
" we recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent , complex , and diverse			0
" the case is @entity22 v. @entity3 ( 11 - 796 ) .			2
