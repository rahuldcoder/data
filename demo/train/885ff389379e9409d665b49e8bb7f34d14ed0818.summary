since then , he 's been slammed with instant fame , become a battled - over tv talk show guest and received a slew of job offers			1

he can show his mom he 's a success			2
but to sustain it we need to make sure he has what he needs			0
" what he needs , said @entity44 , who has not met @entity4 , is a thorough evaluation of his history , of what 's triggered his past substance abuse , and an adequate support mechanism			1
" giving someone success is n't always the answer to make sure someone feels successful , " @entity44 said			2

@entity72 , a concert and event promoter , used to drive by a homeless shelter and camp looking for @entity4 , known in the community as " @entity94			1
" he offered him gigs to emcee events or tape commercials			0
@entity4 always wanted to go back to the shelter or camp , where he felt at home , @entity83 said			1
@entity0 tried to reach @entity72 , but he did not respond to e-mail requests and his voicemail box was full -- perhaps an indicator of how busy and in demand @entity4 is			1
on wednesday morning , @entity4 appeared in the @entity106 studio of @entity107 , where he took to the airwaves on the nationally syndicated @entity110 and @entity111 radio show before taking off for the @entity113 talk shows and into the stratosphere of fame			1

" there 's no road map to this			0
this has n't happened before			0
seventy - two hours ago this man was standing on a corner			0
" the hosts said they had no idea what to expect when @entity4 strolled into the studio			2
but they were touched by his warmth and humility			0
what has happened since has left them overwhelmed in their own way			0
@entity124 said he 's gotten more than 500 e-mails with offers to assist @entity4			1
most of them have been about jobs , but some show that others are thinking about @entity4 ' well - being beyond his career			2
recovering addicts have said they know where he 's been and that they hope he gets the help he needs			0
a faculty member in social work at a nearby school wrote to offer @entity4 " mental health support as he goes on this second - chance journey			1
" " it 's about protecting him from himself as well as protecting him from others , " @entity123 added			0
as of thursday afternoon , @entity4 has more than his friend battle looking out for him , @entity83 said			1
he also now has his 90 - year - old mother , @entity169			2
they were reunited , after 20 years , in a hotel conference room in @entity113			0
after the initial tears that fell when they first embraced , @entity83 said , " she turns around , and she 's mom			0
" less than a minute into their taped reunion , in fact , his mother said , " please do n't disappoint me			2
" " i 'm through with it all , " @entity4 told her			2
" there might be a few bumps in the road ahead for him , " @entity83 speculated			0
