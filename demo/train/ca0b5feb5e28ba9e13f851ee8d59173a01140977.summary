@entity0 -- reaction to the arrest of @entity5 chief @entity4 ranged from concern to outrage to sadness tuesday in @entity9 , where one politician said he was the victim of a " lynching " and others cautioned against what they see as a rush to judgment			1
underscoring the cultural differences between @entity9 and the @entity17 , many @entity9 recoiled from images of @entity4 , who is charged in the alleged sexual assault of a @entity22 hotel housekeeper , in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under @entity9 law to protect the presumption of innocence			1
some @entity9 speculated about whether he was the target of a political setup , while others questioned what they see as a rush to judgment by @entity17 authorities and the @entity17 media			1
" there 's a general feeling of a media , a judicial fury -- of a lynching , " @entity37 , @entity9 's former minister of culture and education and a @entity40 lawmaker , told @entity42 1 radio			1
@entity37 called the @entity17 justice system " inhumane			0
" " for 48 hours now , only the side of the accusation has been heard ... and the versions given by police have been contradictory , " he said			0
" the refusal to allow him out on bail , when no violent crime has been committed -- even in @entity17 suspects are usually let go on bail if a violent crime has not been committed			0
" @entity4 's defense attorneys have insisted he is innocent			1
defense attorney @entity61 on monday called the case " very defensible			1
" " the forensic evidence , we believe , will not be consistent with a forcible account , and we believe there is a very , very defensible case , and he should be entitled to bail , " @entity61 said during the hearing monday			2
a judge disagreed monday , decreeing @entity4 a flight risk and denying him bail			1
he is currently housed in @entity22 's @entity74 jail complex			0
@entity4 's arraignment was televised and clips played on various networks			1
" @entity83 walks , " in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed are standard fare in @entity17			2
" that is not the case in @entity9 , " where cameras are not allowed in courtrooms , the head of the @entity40 , @entity85 , told reporters tuesday in @entity0			1
a 2000 law prohibits the publication of photos of a defendant in handcuffs or in court			0
@entity85 said many of her colleagues were " shocked " at what they saw			0
" since yesterday we 've been overwhelmed by the images and also by the charges against @entity4 , " she said			1
" so we are here to say what we have always done unanimously for the last three days , to remind everyone first of all of the presumption of innocence			0
" she took no questions from reporters			0
" i think that for @entity17 it 's the normal procedure , so there 's nothing shocking about these pictures , but in @entity9 it 's true that these pictures are very shocking for us , because in @entity9 we do n't have the right to show images of a man who is charged but not yet convicted , " @entity9 resident @entity109 , who works in finance , told @entity1 on tuesday			1
" ... it 's two cultural points which are different			0
" @entity122 , spokesman for the @entity40 , said , " it 's very bizarre , strange for us to see one of our leaders between two @entity17 cops , like in a movie			1
" some @entity9 also said they believe investigators moved too quickly to arrest @entity4 , who was pulled off a plane to @entity0 in police custody hours after the alleged incident took place in a $ 3,000 - a - night suite at @entity22 's @entity137 hotel			1
" there is a real feeling that there 's a rush to justice here , " said @entity138 , a correspondent for @entity140 television network			0
however , @entity146 , former head of the @entity149 district attorney 's sex crimes unit , defended the investigators , saying if the special victims unit " had probable cause ... they did the only thing that they could do , which was to stop this man before he left the country			0
" @entity4 was widely considered a leading contender to be put forth as the @entity40 's presidential candidate and face president @entity160 in next year 's election			1
" if you are @entity164 , you are happy , " @entity9 teacher @entity162 said tuesday			1
" if you 're not pro-sarkozy , you have many worries , because it was clear that he was the one with the most chance of beating @entity160			0
" @entity162 said he believes the timing is suspect			0
" it makes more sense that it was a setup than that he 's really guilty , " he said			0
" it could happen , but it 's quite strange for something like this to happen a year before the presidential election			2
" explaining the impact of the news in @entity9 , @entity138 said , " if @entity179 had won the nomination for the @entity181 to run for president and then find out everything we know now and add a criminal element to it -- you get how big that is			1
" @entity179 , a former @entity17 senator from @entity188 , admitted in january 2010 that he had fathered a child with his mistress			0
many @entity9 also said they feel @entity4 has n't been given a chance to present his side of the story adequately , @entity138 said			1
" we have a tradition in @entity9 ... not to judge one way or the other until the real facts have been clearly established , " @entity109 said			1
" for the moment , we have only heard the side of the accusation , and i 'm not saying that 's not true , but simply that we have n't heard the opposing side and the defense 's side , so i think we really have to wait for the real facts to understand what happened			0
" the @entity40 's @entity85 told reporters , " so far , we have only heard accusations from the prosecutor			2
it 's not our ( system )			0
and we are waiting for that other voice , the one of @entity4 and his lawyers , which we will hear in the days to come			2
" the @entity40 , meanwhile , insisted tuesday it will not be deterred from its efforts to win back the presidency in 2012			1
presidential primaries will be held on schedule , said @entity122 , the party spokesman			1
@entity9 typically has a laissez - faire attitude toward extramarital affairs , even if they result in children			2
news like that involving @entity179 or former @entity233 gov. @entity232 , who acknowledged tuesday he fathered a child a decade ago outside of his marriage , does n't cause much of a stir			0
when the scandal involving president @entity238 and @entity239 broke during the 1990s , many @entity9 said it proved @entity238 was strong and could lead the country , @entity138 said			2
the late @entity9 president @entity241 fathered a child during a long - term affair			2
when asked about it by reporters , @entity138 said tuesday , that @entity241 responded , " yes , of course , but it 's my private life			0
" " the cultural difference is fascinating , " @entity138 noted			0
however , criminal charges in the @entity4 case may decrease the @entity9 tolerance , @entity138 said			1
" i think the @entity9 press knows the difference here , " he said			2
" they 've long put up with affairs and not reported them ... but this is criminal			0
" in addition , sympathy for @entity4 may be eroded , @entity138 said , by allegations from @entity9 politician @entity262 , who said following @entity4 's arrest that he attacked her daughter , @entity9 journalist @entity264 , in 2002			1
@entity262 said she cautioned her daughter not to report the alleged incident to police out of concern it might adversely affect her career , as @entity264 was just starting out in journalism			0
@entity264 's attorney told @entity1 monday they are considering filing a police complaint in light of the charges against @entity4			2
@entity4 's attorneys have not responded to @entity1 requests for comment on the 2002 allegations			2
in arguing against allowing the @entity5 chief to go free on bond monday , prosecutors said during his arraignment they believe @entity4 has engaged in " similar acts " at least once before			2
@entity1 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0
