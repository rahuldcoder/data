-- savvy @entity2 users tend to be wary of installing apps that request seemingly unnecessary permissions			1
when an app wants access to data or functions on your phone , such as your contacts list or the ability to send text messages , it can signal potential security or malware risks			1
but @entity2 apps that request no permissions at all ( such as this magic 8 ball app ) are generally considered pretty free of security risks			1
but are they ? earlier this month , a test conducted by the @entity24 showed that even " no - permissions " @entity2 apps can access potentially sensitive data on your phone -- and transmit that data elsewhere via your phone 's web browser			1
specifically , @entity31 of @entity24 created a test app that requested no permissions and installed it on some @entity2 devices			1
he was able to scan the phone 's memory card ( sd card ) and display a list of all non-hidden files on it			0
" while it 's possible to fetch the contents of all those files , i 'll leave it to someone else to decide what files should be grabbed and which are going to be boring , " he wrote			0
he also could see which apps were installed on the phone , and list some files belonging to those apps			2
he observed that this might allow nefarious people to find and exploit permission - related vulnerabilities in certain apps			1
last year the @entity58 @entity2 app presented this kind of problem			1
( @entity58 fixed that problem			0
) and for phones that operate on gsm cell networks ( in the @entity64 , that 's @entity66 and @entity67 ) , @entity24 's test app was able to read identifying information about the phone from the sim card , plus some other information			2
finally , since no - permissions apps can launch the phone 's web browser , that provides a potential route to transmit some data from the phone			1
while @entity31 's test app was designed to seek out such security lapses			0
" it 's trivial for any installed app to execute these actions without any user interaction , " he wrote			0
while this may sound worrying , do n't panic			0
what @entity24 discovered probably should concern @entity2 app developers and @entity85 , rather than consumers who use @entity2 phones and tablets			1
" what this research found is really little cracks in @entity2 -- not great big security holes you could drive a truck through , " said @entity89 , co-founder and chief technical officer of @entity91 , a leading provider of security apps and services for @entity2 devices			1
" that 's why this kind of research is so valuable -- it ultimately helps make @entity2 more secure			2
" according to @entity89 , the bigger problem is not that people might maliciously exploit these security cracks to steal from users or compromise their phones -- but rather that many app developers are " sloppy			1
" for instance , developers sometimes build apps that store user data ( such as usernames and passwords ) in ways that could be easily accessed through the security cracks @entity118 found			1
or the app might open the phone 's web browser to allow functionality that could be handled other ways			2
for instance , @entity124 reported that the photo gallery that comes pre-installed on @entity2 phones by @entity128 , @entity129 , and some other manufacturers stores unencrypted copies of complete addresses associated with photos			2
they found in a completely unencrypted file " a list of locations which matched those of our home , work , family , significant other , friends , and even holiday destinations			0
" these were not gps coordinates , but rather full addresses : door number , street , town , zip code , and country			0
@entity154 noted that this address data apparently was generated by @entity156			0
@entity85 acquired @entity157 in 2004			0
" there is no reason for the application to be caching locations of private photos completely unencrypted , " wrote @entity158 for @entity124			0
" this was information that we 'd never given @entity85 , either on a phone or within @entity157			0
to make matters worse , @entity157 web - album syncing had been switched off a week before the information was found			0
" there 's not a lot that the average consumer can do in terms of spotting whether apps are storing unnecessary data in insecure ways			2
the best practice is still to notice which permissions apps require before installing them , do n't install apps that seem to require too many permissions , and report to the developer any suspicious activity by an app. if the developer is not responsive or seems evasive or shady when you report suspicious app behavior , @entity89 advises alerting @entity85 's @entity2 security team by sending an e-mail to @entity190			1
" that channel is mainly used by developers , but it 's worth letting them know if you have concerns about an app and you are n't getting useful responses from the developer , " he said			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity202 .			0

" no - permission " @entity2 apps can access potentially sensitive data on your phone
the bigger problem is n't malicious exploitation , but rather that app developers are " sloppy "
do n't install apps that require too many permissions , and report any suspicious activity
