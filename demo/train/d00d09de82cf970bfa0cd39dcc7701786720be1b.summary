@entity2 head basketball coach @entity1 -- a man who left his mark on young men both on and off the court -- died saturday evening at the age of 83 , according to the @entity2 's official athletics website			1
he had battled dementia for years , and according to a family statement provided to @entity2 , he " passed away peacefully " in his @entity12 home with his wife and five children by his side			0
" it 's a blessing in some ways , " @entity2 coach @entity18 , a longtime protege of @entity1 's , said at a news conference sunday , " but it is also really hard			1
" @entity18 called @entity1 " the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been			1
" the 64 - year - old @entity18 , who played for @entity2 's junior varsity squad in the 1960s and attended @entity1 's practices during college before serving as his assistant for a decade , further said everything he does in administering the school 's basketball program " is driven by my desire to make coach @entity1 proud			1
" " he set the standard for loyalty and concern for every one of his players , not just the games won or lost , " @entity18 said in his statement			0
" he was the greatest there ever was on the court but far , far better off the court with people			0
his concern for people will be the legacy i will remember most			0
" @entity1 coached the @entity49 from 1961 to 1997 , tallying a record of 879 - 254 in those 36 seasons			1
the school named its basketball arena for @entity1 in 1986 , and it 's still popularly referred to as " the @entity54			1
" on sunday , fans left flowers outside the arena in his memory			0
he also won two national championships , in 1982 and 1993 , and many of his young charges went on to become some of the greatest players in pro basketball history , including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
echoing the sentiments of many who played under @entity1 , @entity66 issued a statement , saying , " other than my parents , no one had a bigger influence on my life than coach @entity1			1
he was more than a coach -- he was my mentor , my teacher , my second father			2
coach was always there for me whenever i needed him and i loved him for it			2
in teaching me the game of basketball , he taught me about life			1
" did you have a coach who inspired you ? share your story on @entity87			2
@entity1 is often mentioned in the same breath as former @entity90 and @entity91 coach @entity89 , @entity93 's @entity92 and longtime rival @entity94 of @entity95 , all of whom are considered among the greatest men 's college basketball coaches of all time			1
@entity94 said he was saddened by the news of @entity1 's passing and applauded him not only as a " magnificent teacher and tactician " but also as a compassionate mentor who believed instilling dignity in his players was as important as honing their basketball skills			1
" his greatest gift was his unique ability to teach what it takes to become a good man			0
that was easy for him to do because he was a great man himself			0
all of his players benefited greatly from his basketball teaching , but even more from his ability to help mold men of integrity , honor and purpose			2
those teachings , specifically , will live forever in those he touched , " the coach said in a statement			2
as further testimony to how @entity1 's legacy transcended sports , the @entity127 feed for @entity95 's basketball team also included several messages honoring the man who beat the @entity134 59 times			1
@entity136 named @entity1 its @entity137 in 1997 , and he was inducted into the @entity138 in 1983			2
he was also one of the founding members in the inaugural class inducted into the @entity141 in 2006			0
" he designed @entity2 's ' @entity143 ' offense , devised the foul - line huddle , created the ' fatigue signal ' and implemented the ' run - and - jump ' defense , " according to his @entity149 biography			2
the @entity152 , @entity151 - born son of two teachers was also a hoopster in his own right and , with his 1952 championship as a @entity157 , is one of only two men to win college basketball championships as a coach and player			1
a four - time national coach of the year , @entity1 is one of only three coaches to win the @entity166 , the @entity167 and @entity168			1
he led the @entity171 men 's team to victory in the 1976 @entity174 games			0
in 2013 , @entity1 joined former president @entity175 and entertainer @entity176 as @entity178 recipients			1
president @entity179 said during the ceremony , " while coach @entity1 could n't join us today due to an illness that he 's facing with extraordinary courage , we also honor his courage in helping to change our country -- he recruited the first black scholarship athlete to @entity187 and helped to integrate a restaurant and a neighborhood in @entity12			1
that 's the kind of character that he represented on and off the court			0
" on sunday , @entity179 issued a statement praising @entity1 's basketball acumen as well as his leadership skills , saying he " reared a generation of players who went on to even better things elsewhere , including a young man named @entity66 -- and all of us from @entity201 are thankful for that			1
" but more importantly , coach @entity1 showed us something that i 've seen again and again on the court -- that basketball can tell us a lot more about who you are than a jumpshot alone ever could			1
he graduated more than 96 percent of his players and taught his teams to point to the teammate who passed them the ball after a basket , " the statement said			0
@entity1 broke @entity2 's color barrier for scholarship athletes in 1967 with his recruitment of @entity220 , a would - be two - time @entity221 who would help skipper the @entity49 to consecutive @entity224 appearances in 1968 and 1969			1
despite averaging 22 points and seven rebounds a game throughout his college career , @entity220 was passed over for @entity230 player of the year honors			0
it 's telling that he once told a @entity233 , @entity187 , newspaper that the snub was the one time in college " that i felt things were done in a prejudicial manner			0
" and what concerned me more was how the media handled it			0
nobody ever said anything about it , never challenged what took place			0
to me , that 's just another form of hypocrisy , " he told the @entity246			0
@entity1 left such an indelible mark on @entity220 's life that when @entity220 spoke at an awards ceremony for @entity1 many years later , he said , " when they introduce coach @entity1 's family , why do n't they mention my name ? my father died when i was 12 years old , and @entity1 is the only father i ever had			1
" recruiting @entity220 was n't @entity1 's first foray into integration			1
in the 1950s , when @entity1 was an assistant coach at @entity2 , a pastor at an inclusive baptist church asked @entity1 to dine with him and a black student at a then - popular @entity12 restaurant that , like most eateries in the city , had a policy of not serving african - americans			1
@entity1 agreed , and the three were allowed to dine			2
" we 're human beings first , coaches and players second , and in the ' 60s we had to strike an extremely delicate balance between the two , " @entity1 once wrote			2
the longtime @entity275 would go on to strike that balance often , speaking out against the @entity276 , the @entity277 , nuclear proliferation and the death penalty , among other causes			0
" @entity171 lost not just a coaching legend , but a gentleman and a citizen , " @entity179 said in his sunday statement			2
@entity1 's wife , @entity285 , accepted the 2013 @entity178 on behalf of her husband , who had been fighting dementia for years			2
sportswriter @entity288 , who reportedly abandoned a biography on @entity1 because of his memory lapses , wrote a column for @entity1 's 83rd birthday last year , outlining how @entity1 refused to engage in self - pity because he 'd led such a great life and knew there were people suffering more than he was			1
@entity296 was a particularly cruel fate to befall a man who " remembered every name , every game , every play in every game			0
he also remembered every call that went against him and anything written or said about one of his players or friends that he thought was a slight -- real or perceived			0
he never asked me how my kids were			0
he asked how @entity311 and @entity312 were , " wrote @entity288 , who says he first noticed @entity1 's flagging memory in 2005			2
even @entity94 , his longtime rival -- and some might say archrival , given the fierce history of competition between @entity2 and @entity95 -- concurred			0
" you 're talking about the person who had the sharpest mind and the most remarkable memory of anyone i 've ever met			0
it 's just not fair , " @entity288 quoted @entity94 as saying			0
people we 've lost in 2015			0

@entity1 was n't just a coach , " but a gentleman and a citizen , " president says
" in teaching me the game of basketball , he taught me about life , " @entity66 says
with a record of 879 - 254 , he is considered one of the best coaches of all time
