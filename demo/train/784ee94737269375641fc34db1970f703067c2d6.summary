@entity0 -- thousands of firearms have gone missing from manufacturers ' inventories since 2009 " without a record of being legally sold , " according to a report released thursday by a gun control advocacy group			1
the report by the @entity9 put the number of missing weapons at 16,485			2
" it is shocking that gun makers are so oblivious to public safety that they lose track of thousands of guns every year , " @entity13 , acting president of the @entity9 , said in a statement			1
" given the lethality of its product , the gun industry has a special duty to act responsibly			2
instead , it has a scandalous record of carelessness			1
" the @entity9 report suggests that some guns may never have had serial numbers stamped into them , making them virtually impossible to trace			1
the group says that the missing guns are often used by criminals precisely because they are so hard to trace			2
the report does not mention which manufacturers are reported to having missing firearms			0
the @entity9 says the data was collected from a @entity39 report that was presented to the gun industry last month			1
but the report also states that @entity39 conducts their compliance examinations at only about 20 % of gun dealers and manufacturers each year , and says as a result , " the 16,485 ' missing ' guns are likely a vast undercount of the total number of guns that disappeared from gun manufacturers in the last two and a half years			2
" @entity51 , publisher of @entity52 , slammed the report in a statement to @entity1			0
" the @entity56 spin and implication that some manufacturers , whose names are not mentioned so we ca n't check the charges , are knowingly selling guns before they are logged into the manufacturer 's records is absolutely ridiculous , " @entity51 said			1
according to @entity39 statistics , more than 5 million firearms were made in the @entity67 in 2008 by about 4,487 manufacturers			0
the federal law enforcement agency is in charge of inspecting companies that make and sell firearms to make sure they are in compliance with federal laws			0
the @entity39 says about 600 agents did more than 10,000 inspections last year , but the @entity9 says the agency is n't able to do enough because it lacks manpower and money			0
the @entity39 said it had not read the report and would not comment			0
the @entity9 is an advocacy group for tightened gun laws and was named after @entity56 , president @entity84 's press secretary , who was shot in the head in the attempted assassination of @entity84 in 1981 .			0
