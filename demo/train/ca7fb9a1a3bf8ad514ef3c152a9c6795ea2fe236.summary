-- @entity2 owner @entity1 has made his proverbial bed			1
and , oh , is he lying in it now			0
the ugly comments about blacks and @entity7 attributed to him have hit struck another nerve -- this time with players , fans and most decent - thinking @entity12			2
@entity14 players protest racist talk attributed to @entity2 owner @entity1 the tape released a few days ago reportedly shows that the person identified as @entity1 can profess his own kind of love for a woman who 's black and @entity22 but refuses to " allow " her to befriend her own kind : blacks and @entity7			1
@entity1 allegedly says his girlfriend ( whom he at one point on the tape calls " stupid " ) can meet with blacks and sleep with blacks but not take pictures with them ( in this case former @entity33 star turned entrepreneur @entity35 ) or bring them to @entity2 games			1
like some slave owners who kept their mixed - race female slaves in better living conditions and bestowed privileges upon them , @entity37 can allegedly be heard telling a woman identified as @entity43 that he does n't have a problem with her or her race but that she should n't fraternize with blacks and @entity7 because it disturbs him			1
so that makes her " special			0
" she 's not really black			0
it sounds like @entity1 , who has been married for nearly 50 years , shared a rarely heard perspective that his lover / girlfriend / mistress can mitigate the " inferiority " ( my term ) of her racial mixture by spending more time with him			1
oh , yeah , @entity37 is white			0
the man on the recording appears to admonish and belittle her for posting photos on @entity60 and calling attention to her willingness to interact with blacks -- and he holds particular distaste for @entity35 , a man who is seen as a true " good guy " by many @entity67			0
@entity1 and his reported racist thoughts are not unique			2
what is unusual is that the sentiments were made public			0
@entity1 is the lead news story now , just days after another big news story focused on conservative hero rancher @entity73 , who pondered whether blacks should have remained slaves			1
" and i 've often wondered , " @entity73 said , " are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? " how many times and in how many ways do we see the impact of this kind of racist thinking by people holding powerful positions in our country 's institutions and businesses ? how many times do we have to hear proclaim " i 'm not a racist " and think they can get away with it ? i 'd love to hear their reaction to the @entity2 ' decision to wear their warmup shirts inside - out and toss their warmups in a pile at center court just before sunday 's @entity105			0
would they ask , " how dare they ? " reaction : ' disturbing and offensive ' so thank goodness for the tape			0
@entity112 is a two - party consent recording state , meaning you can not record a person 's comments -- on the phone or in person -- without his / her permission			2
however , @entity1 seems to have consented to being recorded			2
a @entity121 report alleges that his girlfriend routinely recorded their calls at his request because he sometimes forgot what he 'd said to her , and she even played this recording back to him after he denied to her he made the racist statements			0
now , i do n't understand what that 's about , but i pray for a public outcry should @entity43 face any charges for recording @entity1 's racist remarks			1
as for what punishment @entity1 might face , if the authentication process identifies the speaker as @entity1 , there can be only one outcome : loss of his team ownership			1
@entity14 commissioner @entity142 is a decent man			2
i know him from my days as majority owner of the @entity145 @entity144			1
silver is measured and thorough , and i , like most of the basketball world , eagerly await his decision on @entity1 's discipline			1
as a matter of course , a person , even a person with immense wealth , ca n't decide to own a team and then just buy one			0
@entity14 lawyers and financial folks pore through your background , including the source of your funds , your tax status , your character and community standing , etc. then the @entity165 has to vote you in as a member / owner			1
and if , in the league 's estimation , your status becomes a negative , the same @entity165 can vote you out as a member / owner			2
it will be @entity142 's decision to take it to the board , but any board member can initiate a motion to terminate an owner 's right to own the franchise			0
so i await two things : verification that @entity1 is the person on the tape and the @entity14 's termination of his ownership of the @entity2			1
let 's not let history repeat itself , again			0
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0
