-- a @entity2 high school student athlete with @entity3 might get to keep playing sports during his senior year despite his age			1
the @entity7 said monday that its representative council had approved a proposal for a vote by member schools that would change the group 's constitution to allow for a waiver of its maximum age limit under " narrowly defined " circumstances			1
under current rules , students who turn 19 before september 1 are not allowed to compete			0
the rule is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older , more developed athlete playing against younger students			1
@entity26 , the @entity2 student with @entity3 , turned 19 in january			1
he was held back in kindergarten because of his disability			0
the athletic association did not mention @entity26 by name , but it released a statement that was clearly meant to deflect criticism over the way it has handled the question of his participation			1
ballots will be mailed this week , the athletic association said , and schools will have two weeks to return them			2
" the representative council does not advance proposals it does not want the membership to support , and an affirmative vote by schools is being specifically requested on this proposal , " it said			1
the specific wording of the proposal was not immediately available			0
it is expected to be posted on the group 's website no later than may 14			0
a two - thirds majority is required to change the organization 's constitution			0
@entity26 has played sports with other children in @entity58 , @entity2 , since he was in elementary school			1
" we did n't know how far he 'd go , how many coaches would keep him on the team , " said @entity60 , @entity26 's father			1
when he got to high school , @entity26 was invited to keep playing			1
now a junior , he is on the @entity67 and basketball teams			0
he attends every practice and works out with the other players and sometimes plays a few minutes at the end of the game			0
during this season 's basketball playoffs , @entity26 brought the house down			1
after maintaining a nice lead , the team put @entity26 in the game and he hit a three - point shot against rival @entity80			2
" i was on the left side behind the three - point line and they passed me the ball , " @entity26 said , smiling as he recounted the game			2
" i heard the fans , including my mom crying			0
" @entity26 's father was in the stands with his camera and captured the amazing reaction			2
" i videotaped the crowd on the other side and it was made up of mostly @entity96 fans , including their student section , and they were all on their feet cheering for @entity26			2
" the same thing happened when @entity26 kicked his first extra point for the football team toward the end of a game two years ago			1
" i was amazed that he even had the opportunity to kick , and then when he did it , i thought woo - hoo ! and then watching the kids react , they carried him off the field ; it was just one of the best moments , " recalls @entity26 's mother , @entity108			2
for the past two years , the @entity117 , with the support of the @entity116 , have tried to get the rule changed so @entity26 can play during his senior year			1
" the rule is 100 years old			0
we 've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities			0
and i think it 's time that the rule catches up with that , " said @entity60			0
@entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

@entity26 has @entity3 and plays high school football and basketball
a @entity2 school rule would prevent him from playing his senior year because of his age
