-- thousands of @entity2 voters hit the polls on tuesday to cast their ballots on a referendum that would constitutionally ban same - sex marriage , even though state law already does not permit such unions			1
amendment 1 would alter the @entity10 to say that " marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state			2
" supporters argue that the amendment is needed to stop those trying to redefine marriage and to ward off possible future actions of " activist judges			2
" it would also strengthen the state 's position against same - sex civil unions , often considered a precursor to the marriage issue			1
opponents say the measure is redundant and could result in jeopardizing domestic violence protections for women and affect couples ' health benefits			2
follow all the political news at @entity0 's @entity34 several municipalities in @entity2 provide benefits to same - sex couples , state officials say			1
@entity40 law professor @entity39 says those rights could be potentially lost if the referendum passes on tuesday			1
concerns over the measure also home in on the potential for unintended consequences , she said , affecting issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence among unmarried couples because of the narrow definition of the new statute			2
" before domestic violence laws , we relied on criminal assault laws , which do n't always protect against things like stalking , " added @entity55 , who says the measure could also affect heterosexual couples			2
but sen. @entity63 , one of the primary sponsors of the proposed amendment , said he does n't " believe those are legitimate concerns			0
" " we looked at these issues extensively and tried to make sure that all of those concerns are addressed , " he said			0
a simple majority is needed for the measure to be approved			0
it was passed in the @entity73 and @entity74 last year			0
both are @entity76 - controlled , the first time that 's happened in @entity2 in the past 140 years , according to house officials			1
" this bill 's been 12 years in the making , " noted @entity79 , a law professor at @entity80 at @entity81			1
" but it 's now made possible because @entity76 control the legislature			1
" should amendment 1 gain approval , it would largely prevent the state 's judiciary from overturning the bill by enshrining its language into the state constitution			0
some 500,000 people had already cast ballots on the measure through early voting or absentee ballots			0
polls are set to close at 7:30 p.m. et. " it could destroy our family unit , " said @entity100 alongside and her partner of 17 years , @entity101			1
" if they could see that it 's a family they 're affecting , maybe they could sit down and think about the issue before they vote on @entity111			0
" others say the issue , if left unchecked , could one day undermine traditional notions of marriage			0
evangelist @entity115 endorsed the ballot initiative , a rare move for a preacher who has typically avoided political fights			0
@entity115 took out full - page ads in 14 @entity2 newspapers touting his support for the measure , saying " the @entity124 is clear -- @entity126 's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman			1
" @entity115 's website encouraged churches to download a poster that bears his image and the message " @entity135 may 8th			0
" on the other side , former president @entity136 opposed the amendment in a recording sent by phone to hundreds of thousands of @entity2 homes			1
" so the real effect of the law is not to keep the traditional definition of marriage , you 've already done that , " @entity136 says in the recording			0
" the real effect of the law will be to hurt families and drive away jobs			0
" the only recent public opinion polling on the issue , derived from a group that does work for @entity156 candidates and causes , indicates that a majority of @entity2 voters support the amendment			1
nationally , according to a new @entity163 survey , 50 % of @entity161 believe same - sex couples should be allowed to wed , a markedly different position than in past years , suggesting a growing acceptance of same - sex marriages			1
some 48 % say they do not support same - sex weddings			1
sen. @entity63 described marriage on tuesday as a " time - tested building block of society that revolves around procreation			1
" but three days earlier , vice president @entity175 said he was " absolutely comfortable " with the idea of same - sex marriage			1
" i just think that the good news is that as more and more americans come to understand what this is all about , it is a simple proposition : who do you love ? who do you love ? and will you be loyal to the person who love ? " @entity175 said on @entity187 's " @entity186			0
" @entity175 did not mention the @entity2 initiative and added that it 's the president , not he , who sets the administration 's policy			1
president @entity193 has taken the official position that his views on the issue are " evolving			0
" thirty states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a hetereosexual union			0
" of states without constitutional amendments on marriage , 45 % ( 9 of 20 ) eventually recognize same - sex marriage , either by direct judicial decree , by legislative action , or by a ruling requiring that same - sex marriages from other states be treated as valid , " a nonprofit political group called the @entity204 said in a statement			1
" among the 30 states with marriage amendments , none have been repealed			0
" @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and the @entity224 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			2
