@entity0 , @entity1 -- a judge needs to decide if new lawyers are needed to defend @entity5 and four other prisoners charged in the september 11 terrorist attacks or if more hearings should be conducted on whether there 's any conflict of interest caused by an @entity13 investigation			1
a @entity15 lawyer acknowledged monday that the @entity13 investigated members of the team representing @entity5 and the other @entity0 detainees accused of the september 11 attacks , prompting the lead defense lawyer to threaten to pull out of the case out of fears that he too is a subject of a federal probe			1

i am trimming my sails			0
i am pulling my punches			0
i am being extremely careful about how i proceed , " @entity28 told the military commission hearing the case , adding that he canceled a trip to the @entity32 to do investigative work			0
