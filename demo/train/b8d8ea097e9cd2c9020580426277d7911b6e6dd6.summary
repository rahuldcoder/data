a video is going viral of violin virtuoso @entity8 stranded on the tarmac of @entity10 , @entity11 's airport monday , playing his heart out in indignation -- on a priceless violin			1

@entity65 , t - shirt , jogging pants the youthful looking @entity8 told @entity68 's @entity69 that he did n't feel they were being taken seriously			2
standing on the tarmac in his @entity75 t - shirt and jogging pants , with a baseball cap on backward , his appearance was a far cry from the clich√© of an elegantly dressed @entity80			1
but @entity8 is used to breaking the mold with his trio , especially musically			0
on their historic string instruments , they love to stroke out country music , bluegrass and jazz , or improvise their own hybrids in jam sessions			0

it was n't the last run - in @entity8 and @entity42 would have over the priceless violins			2
on the next flight they took , the same thing nearly happened again , @entity8 and @entity42 said , when a ticket agent asked them to turn in their instruments as checked baggage			2
