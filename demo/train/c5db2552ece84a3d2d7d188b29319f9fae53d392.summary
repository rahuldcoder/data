-- one day after leading a peaceful procession of demonstrators along the streets of his native @entity4 , @entity6 , state highway patrol capt. @entity7 turned an outdoor news conference into an impromptu community forum			1
" i 'm here to make sure they hear what i 'm talking about , " @entity7 , standing with gov. @entity10 and others , told reporters friday			1
he stepped away from the microphone and moved closer to members of a community still seething after saturday 's racially - charged police shooting of an unarmed black teenager			2
" move in a little closer , " he implored residents who had gathered behind reporters			2
" for the man tapped thursday to restore order in the restive @entity27 suburb where sometimes violent protests were met with a heavy - handed police response , the mission is personal			1
demonstrations and confrontations with local police marked the night hours earlier this week , in the wake of a weekend police shooting by a white officer that left an 18 - year - old @entity40 - @entity39 man dead			2
@entity41 , who was unarmed , died in the saturday shooting			0
police say he was trying to grab the officer 's gun			0
witnesses say @entity41 was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot			0
state troopers took over security after days of clashes between protesters and local police , who have been accused of using excessive force -- including rubber bullets and tear gas -- in response to the demonstrations			1
" the people of our community need to hear what i 'm saying , " @entity7 told the crowd			1
this is n't about @entity7 ... it is about the people that live in our community			1
" on thursday night , @entity7 and other officials marched with the protesters and , in his words , they " walked and shook hands and talked to people and listened and promised that we 're going to communicate better			1
" " last night was a great night , " he recalled on friday			2
" there were no calls for service			0
we did not deploy tear gas			0
we did not have road blocks			0
we did not make any arrests			2
it was a good night			0
" at friday 's news conference , residents expressed skepticism on details released earlier by @entity4 's police chief implicating @entity41 as the " primary suspect " in a convenience store robbery moments before he was killed			1
@entity7 said he would brief residents about the claims after meeting with police chief @entity94			1
but he urged residents " to make sure that we do n't burn down our own house , that we do n't go down there and vandalize our own buildings ... that does n't prove a point			2
that does not solve the issue			0
that hurts this community , and that 's what i do n't want			0
" at one point in the news conference , a man who said he was the father of seven children talked about his kids being " scared to death " of the police			2
@entity7 responded more like a pastor than a law enforcement officer : " when i got home , my daughter said , ' @entity116 , were you scared ? ' i said , ' just a little			1
' she said , ' @entity116 , i want you to remember when @entity118 asked @entity119 to walk with him in the water			0
when @entity119 got scared @entity118 picked him up and said have faith			0
' today , we need to be just like @entity119			0
" on social media , people praised @entity7 's handling of the situation			1
what an incredible night this is in @entity130 , " one person tweeted			0
music impresario @entity131 tweeted : " when police know the community and come from community , the relationship can be transformed overnight			0
@entity4 " when @entity7 took over security in @entity138 , the suburb had become a flashpoint			1
" a young man lost his life and so i grieve for that family because i have a son , " he told @entity0 's @entity140			2
" we 're going to look at this from a personal standpoint and if that was my son -- or that was my friend -- how would i feel ? " @entity7 grew up in the area and considers it both his community and his home			1
5 things to know about @entity41 's shooting although locals say race relations have long been troubled between the city 's mostly @entity39 population and the mostly white police force , anger spilled out after @entity41 's death			0
" it means a lot to me , personally , that we break the cycle of violence , diffuse the tension and build trust -- showing the utmost respect for every interaction with every citizen , " @entity7 , who is @entity39 , told reporters			1
" moving forward , i 'm confident that the patrol and police resources present here in @entity4 will do just that			1
" @entity7 said he is committed to the new approach			1
he stressed the importance of not focusing on the past			0
" we 're going to start from today			0
we 're not going to look back in the past , " @entity7 said			2
" we are going to have a different approach and have the approach that we 're in this together			0
" complete coverage of @entity4 shooting and protests a white man 's response to @entity4 @entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			1
