-- the parents of a 15 - year - old @entity3 girl are seeking to get their daughter back after she ran away with her boyfriend to @entity6 , where authorities handed her over to the boyfriend 's family			1
the @entity6 authorities ' decision to give custody of @entity13 to her boyfriend 's uncle , while a legal action against her goes through the system , has left her family and @entity3 officials scratching their heads			1
" if this was a senator 's daughter , if this was a congressman 's daughter , somebody would 've gotten her back already , " said @entity13 's father , @entity21 of @entity22			2
on august 29 , @entity13 and her boyfriend , whom she had met online less than a year ago , boarded a flight from @entity32 , @entity33 , to @entity34 , @entity6 , with @entity13 using a fake passport , police said			1
a federal police commissioner in @entity38 state , where @entity34 is located , said that @entity13 arrived at the @entity39 and went through the customs process , where it was determined that the @entity6 passport she was using belonged to someone else			1
because @entity13 is a minor , she was transferred to the custody of @entity6 's civil police , which will investigate the crime			1
she was not immediately sent back to the @entity3 because the crime she is accused of committing does not allow for immediate repatriation , the official said			2
instead , she was released to her boyfriend 's uncle , without any consultation with her parents in the @entity3 , the father said			1
details about her boyfriend , his nationality and that of his uncle were not immediately known			0
" it is outrageous and very dangerous to the welfare and well - being of an @entity3 minor girl that the @entity6 government hastily awarded custody to a man who is not in any way related to 15 - year - old @entity13 , " said rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , who was a sponsor of the @entity63			1
" i am painfully aware that runaways and child abductees are at significant risk of exploitation and abuse			0
@entity6 has a legal and moral duty to immediately return @entity13 to her parents in the @entity3 " the office of rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , who represents the district where @entity21 lives , said it has been in touch with the parties involved			1
" we reached out to the family last week and have been in touch with the family and the @entity89 , " the office said			0
" we 've been working with the consulate in @entity6 as well			0
" @entity3 officials in @entity6 are working closely with @entity6 officials and talking to @entity13 and her family to provide assistance , said @entity95 , who is with the @entity3 @entity96 in @entity97			1
the father 's attorney , @entity98 , told @entity108 's " @entity107 " that the @entity89 told the mother that @entity3 officials conducted a " wellness check " on @entity13 on thursday , during which they took pictures of the girl and the house where she is staying			2
also , sen. @entity110 , d - @entity22 , has reached out to the family , his office said			0
@entity21 said he has considered going to @entity6 himself to get his daughter , but said he could be breaking @entity6 law if he were to attempt to get his daughter back on his own			2
in the meantime , all communications between @entity13 's family and the boyfriend 's family have ceased since she went to @entity6			1
" we need the attention of the @entity3 and @entity6 governments , " @entity13 's mother , @entity120 , said in statement			1
" @entity13 needs to be taken into custody and deported back to the @entity3 immediately			2
" she added , " all adults who enabled a 15 - year - old girl through two @entity3 ( security checkpoints ) into @entity6 should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			2
" " honestly , we just want her to come home , " @entity21 said			0
" i want her to really come to her senses and say , ' you know what , this was a mistake			0
' " judging from a phone call @entity13 had with @entity0 affiliate @entity139 , there are still many obstacles to that			0
" i definitely do not want to go back			0
i 'd rather jump off a bridge with sharks and piranhas in the water , with meat tied to my neck , than go back there , " she said			0
" obviously , they do n't care how i feel			0
