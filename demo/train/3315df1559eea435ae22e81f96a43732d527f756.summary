she was an active 17 - year - old who rarely got sick and had n't been to a doctor in more than three years			1
then one day , she came home with the flu			2
she died a week later			1
@entity0 is part of grim new statistics released this week by the @entity7 showing that the flu has reached an epidemic level in the @entity10 this year			1
it 's blamed for more deaths than it was at this time last year -- including 15 children			1
that 's as of december 20			0
already , more flu - related deaths are suspected , including a 4 - year - old boy in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity1 affiliate @entity22 reports			2
it 's still early in the flu season , which often begins in early fall and persists through may , so it remains to be seen exactly how pervasive the flu will be			2
passed out in her mother 's arms , never came to shortly before she died on december 9 , @entity0 had worked her way -- slowly -- down the stairs at home by sitting and sliding down each step			1
she eventually made her way to the bathroom to take a bath			0
" i helped her get in the bathtub , but when i saw her eyes , i said , ' i think this is a mistake -- we 've got to get you out of here , ' " her grief - stricken mother , @entity36 , in @entity37 , @entity38 , told @entity1 on wednesday			0
" she could n't help me get her out			0
so i lifted her up , and she passed away in my arms			0
" technically , @entity0 was still alive , but she never regained consciousness			1
@entity0 began administering mouth - to - mouth resuscitation and screamed for her husband , @entity49 , who called 911			1
emergency medical workers rushed @entity0 to a hospital , which found a slight heartbeat and flew her to a larger hospital			1
after a few hours , her heart stopped altogether			0
" she was such an incredible kid , " @entity55 said by phone			0
" she had her whole life planned out			0
she was living life to the fullest			0
if you 're going to have the perfect kid , she was it			0
" @entity0 had taken her daughter to a clinic at the hospital when she first became ill. she was told that her sickness was the flu and would run its course at home			1
the @entity69 cared for her , gave her liquids and did everything they were told			0
but @entity0 says the family later learned that at some point , @entity0 's liver gave out			1
and an autopsy confirmed that she had a type a flu			2
the @entity7 said that because of privacy rules , it can say only that there were two " confirmed reports of flu - pediatric deaths in @entity38 this season			1
" it will be several more weeks before autopsy results show whether @entity0 had an underlying health issue that the family was unaware of , @entity0 says			1
the @entity86 recommends an annual physical exam throughout childhood after the age of 4			0
but a study found that one third of @entity38 teens ages 13 to 17 had no preventive care visits , and another 40 % had only one such visit during those years			2
medical care not enough when @entity0 became sick , @entity0 says , she got excellent medical care , but it was n't enough			1
she wants more people suffering from symptoms to have blood tests			0
@entity0 had not had the vaccine			1
her father was vaccinated , but her mother was not because she had a bad reaction to a swine flu vaccine in the 1970s , she said			2
( " if a person has had a serious allergic reaction to flu vaccines in the past , this might be a contraindication to getting one , but they should talk with their doctor to understand if that reaction is relevant to the decision to get a vaccine now , " says dr. @entity107 , chief of the @entity108 of the @entity7 's @entity109			1
) the @entity69 gave their daughter a choice , and she chose to forgo the vaccine			0
it 's unknown whether the vaccine would have saved her			0
bad year for the vaccine the @entity7 said it does not yet have information on how many of those killed by the flu this year were vaccinated			1
it 's an unusually bad year for the vaccine			0
just over half the strains tested were not covered by it			0
the biggest reason is a mutated strain that was not being spread at the time the vaccine was designed			0
predicting the flu to help avoid it still , getting vaccinated is " the best way to reduce the chances that you will get seasonal flu and spread it to others " and " may make your illness milder if you do get sick , " according to the @entity7			1
" it 's still about 61 % effective , " dr. @entity142 , a @entity1 medical analyst , said			2
" most flu vaccines protect against three or four different strains of flu actually , so even if it 's not a great match against one particular strain , it will still protect you against the other strains that are going around right now			2
" alarming numbers while alarming , the latest statistics do n't indicate that the outbreak this year will be , overall , worse than in previous years , the @entity7 told @entity1 on wednesday			1
it 's too early to know			0
flu activity is high in nearly half the country -- 22 states and @entity158 , according to a map released by the @entity7			1
an infectious disease specialist with the @entity162 health care system in @entity163 , @entity164 , said medical staff has been busy			2
" we 've seen more patients than we anticipated , " dr. @entity166 told @entity1 affiliate @entity167			2
" the hope is that things will stabilize , but i do n't see it stopping anytime soon			0
" the " epidemic threshold " is crossed to some extent every year , a @entity7 chart shows			1
in the week ending december 20 , nearly 7 % of deaths were blamed on pneumonia and flu			1
that 's higher than it was at the same time last year , but later on in the season , the percentage of deaths blamed on the flu generally goes higher			2
the number of children killed by the flu spiked tremendously in 2013			1
thirty - seven deaths were blamed on the flu in the 2011 to 2012 season ; the next season , 2012 - 2013 , there were 171 deaths , the @entity7 says			1
in the 2013 to 2014 season , the figure was 109			0
the 2009 season , which stretched from april 2009 to october 2010 and included the @entity198 pandemic , saw 348 deaths			0
totals are known for children but not adults because child deaths must be reported to the @entity7 ; there 's no similar requirement for adult deaths			1
older people are generally those worst - affected			0
flu - related hospitalizations among people 65 and older has reached 38.3 per 100,000 people , the highest rate of any age group , the @entity7 says			1
flu activity generally peaks in the @entity10 between december and february			2
the not knowing @entity55 says she did not catch the flu from her daughter , even after administering mouth - to - mouth resuscitation			2
mixed in with all the pain and grief the family is suffering is the frustration of not knowing how the death happened			0
" i just can not figure out why she died from this , " the grieving mother says			2
@entity1 had contacted an online fundraising campaign for the @entity0 family -- her parents and her sister , who is married and has a baby -- to learn more about the girl 's death			1
organizers got back in touch , saying @entity55 wanted to talk and deliver a message : " we need to take it more seriously			0
and you need to be really proactive			0
" @entity1 's @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0
