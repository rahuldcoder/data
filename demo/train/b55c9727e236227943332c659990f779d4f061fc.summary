@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity5 police practice of keeping dna records of anyone they arrest is a human rights violation , the @entity3 ruled unanimously thursday			1
the @entity3 says the @entity5 should not be keeping dna records of everyone they arrest			1
two @entity5 took the case to the court after the police retained their fingerprints and dna when criminal cases against them ended without conviction			1
both then requested that the samples be destroyed , but their request was denied on the basis of a @entity5 law authorizing them to be retained indefinitely			1
the court awarded them 42,000 euros ( $ 53,000 ) to cover their legal costs			2
the court was " struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention in @entity0 and @entity35 , " it said in a statement announcing the ruling			2
it ruled the @entity5 practice was a violation of the " right to respect for private and family life " under @entity42 of the @entity43			1
the two applicants are both from the northern @entity0 city of @entity46			2
one , @entity47 , was arrested in march 2001 and charged with harassment of his partner			0
the case was formally discontinued three months later when he and his partner reconciled			0
the second applicant , a minor identified in court papers only as @entity54 , was arrested in january 2001 , aged 11 , for attempted robbery			0
he was acquitted in june 2001 , on the same day the case against @entity47 was dropped			0
@entity47 told @entity2 he was surprised the case went as far as it did			0
" it 's a shame it had to go all the way to the @entity3			1
it was only a trivial thing in the beginning , " he said			0
he was in favor of the police dna database when it was introduced			1
" i was n't against the principle of it			0
i 'm all for @entity64 investigation at a crime scene			0
" he added that he did not object to retaining the dna of convicted criminals " so if you committed a crime later it could be traced and checked out			2
" but , he said , if a case " has not been to court , then the dna evidence should be thrown out with it			2
" the court ruling can not be appealed , and theoretically requires the @entity5 government to change its policies			1
but @entity5 home secretary @entity82 , who is responsible for the police , said she was " disappointed " by the ruling and that the existing law would " remain in place while we carefully consider the judgment			1
" " dna and fingerprinting is vital to the fight against crime , providing the police with more than 3,500 matches a month , " she said in a statement released by the @entity90 thursday			1
" the government mounted a robust defense before the court , and i strongly believe @entity64 and fingerprints play an invaluable role in fighting crime and bringing people to justice			0
" @entity2 's @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
