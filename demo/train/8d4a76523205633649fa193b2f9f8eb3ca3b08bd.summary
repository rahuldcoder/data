@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 claimed their second @entity4 crown with a hard - fought 15 - 6 victory at the @entity1 on saturday night as @entity6 failed in their bid to become the first team to defend their title			1
@entity2 skipper @entity10 proudly holds aloft the @entity11 in @entity0			1
the @entity2 -- who triumphed at home in 1995 -- failed to score a try for the first time in the tournament , while @entity6 were unlucky to have one controversially ruled out by the video referee soon after half - time			1
@entity19 dived over the line in the left corner but , after much deliberation , video referee @entity22 ruled that the winger had touched the whitewash with his foot before going over			2
it was a bitter blow for the @entity28 , who had showed little attacking potency throughout the tournament but were beginning to show some promising signs			2
@entity34 's team were beaten 36 - 0 by @entity2 in the pool stages , but showed big improvement to reach the final with upset wins over @entity39 and hosts @entity1 after adopting a dour , forward - driven approach			1
@entity41 , who is now expected to stand down as the @entity2 ' coach , saw his side dominate the lineouts in the final while @entity6 paid for poor discipline			1
full - back @entity47 kicked four penalties and @entity50 landed another from just inside his opponents ' half , while @entity6 's sole points came from the boot of 2003 hero @entity56			1
@entity47 kicked @entity2 ahead with a seventh - minute penalty after @entity58 slipped in midfield and failed to release the ball			1
@entity56 replied with a penalty of his own five minutes later after @entity2 winger @entity62 spilled an up - and - under kick			1
@entity47 made it 6 - 3 with another goal after flanker @entity66 needlessly stuck out his left boot to trip @entity68 in the 15th minute , and @entity56 was wide with a drop - goal attempt soon after			1
@entity50 was just wide with a long - range penalty as @entity6 's forwards infringed again at the ruck , and the @entity2 spurned a great opportunity just before half - time when scrum - half @entity75 went for the line from close range instead of passing , and spilled the ball			1
however , the @entity81 pack screwed @entity6 's scrum and won their own feed , from which no. 8 @entity84 was held up on the line after a bullish burst -- and @entity6 were penalized for killing the ball , allowing @entity47 to land a third penalty for 9 - 3 at the break and a personal haul of 102 points for the tournament			1
@entity6 came out after the break without captain and 2003 winner @entity96 , with @entity97 taking his place at prop			1
and the @entity28 almost crossed for the first try of the game as center @entity58 brilliantly burst through several tackles before being cut down just short of the line , and the ball was flicked wide to @entity19 on the left			2
however , @entity106 official @entity22 made a crucial decision which denied a vital five - pointer			2
@entity6 gained some reward , however , as referee @entity109 had noticed a @entity81 infringement before @entity19 crossed , and @entity56 reduced the deficit to 9 - 6 with his second penalty			1
in the 47th minute , the career of @entity114 came to an end when the @entity6 full - back was forced to limp off with a groin injury in what was his final game before retiring			1
@entity47 extended @entity2 's lead three minutes later after @entity122 infringed at a ruck , and @entity50 -- at 20 the second - youngest player to feature in a final -- made it 15 - 6 from 47 meters out after @entity126 blocked @entity127 in the 62nd minute			1
@entity6 made a raft of changes , bringing on 2003 champion @entity130 for possibly his last match at international level , but could not find a way through the @entity2 ' defense			1
@entity96 refused to blame @entity22 's decision for his side 's defeat			2
" you get decisions like that in a game			2
sometimes you get them , sometimes you do n't , " he said			0
" i 'm not going to stand here and blame the referee			0
" @entity122 added : " we ca n't fault effort and the heart			0
it 's a shame that all that spirit counts for nothing			0
we gave it everything but it did n't go to plan			0
we are immensely disappointed and it 's heartbreaking			0
" @entity41 hailed his side 's stout defense , saying : " that 's what wins @entity162			2
@entity6 were a bit unlucky not to get that try			1
i 'm really over the moon and it 's a massive win for us as a group			0
" skipper @entity10 added : " i 'm sitting here and i 'm trying not to cry			0
it 's a feeling you ca n't put into words			0
this is for all of you			0
thank you very much for all your support , even in bad times			0
" it 's a reward for four years of dedication and hard work			0
@entity6 gave us a good run			2
but we responded well to their technical kicking			0
" lock @entity185 , who is joining @entity187 side @entity186 , was named man of the match after dominating @entity6 's jumpers at the throw - ins			1
we worked for four years for this			0
we knew we were going to have to take it to @entity6 up front , " he said			2
" the emotions are greater than i ever thought			0
i ca n't wait to get back home			0
i ca n't wait to see all the @entity81			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
