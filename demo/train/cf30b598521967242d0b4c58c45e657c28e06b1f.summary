-- " @entity1 " is a frustratingly old - school , @entity3 - style , inspirational biopic about @entity5 that does n't trust a viewer 's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen			1
@entity10 plays @entity5 and @entity11 plays husband @entity12 in " @entity1			1
" the mystery we ought to be paying attention to is : what really happened on the legendary @entity19 aviator 's final , fatal flight in 1937 ? but the question audiences are left with is this : how could so tradition - busting a role model have resulted in so square , stiff , and earthbound a movie ? why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format ? dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits , leather jackets , scarves , and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic , @entity10 's @entity5 does n't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she 's at her own breakfast table			1
and director @entity36 ( " @entity43 " ) , working from an overexplanatory script by @entity38 and @entity39 ( based on dual biographies by @entity41 and @entity42 ) , overloads the picture with a cargo of messages , so much so that she deadens her subject 's spirit			2
some of these talking points are aimed at today 's teenage girls who might admire the subject 's highly personal fashion sense ; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred			2
all of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach : @entity5 lived free in life and love ! and fly ! she ! must ! of course , she did , setting records as the first woman to fly across the @entity66 in 1928 ( she was a passenger , but still , ladies of the day generally did n't wear leather helmets and zoom through the air )			1
@entity5 was the first woman to fly solo across the @entity66 in 1932			1
she went on to launch her own brand - name fashion line			0
in 1935 , she became the first pilot to fly solo from @entity72 to @entity73			0
sometimes the press dubbed her @entity5 , linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot @entity77			1
most famously , she vanished ( along with her navigator , @entity78 ) in the middle of the @entity80 while on an around - the - world flight in 1937 ; her plane was never found , and she was declared legally dead in 1939			0
along the way , the celebrity married @entity12 , the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image			0
( @entity11 does the honors as @entity12 with all the dated , silver - head - in - hands poses required of him as a worried businessman / spouse whose wife is also his client			2
) for a time , the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer @entity95 ( @entity97 ) , now best known as the father of writer @entity99			0
@entity10 delivers long , carefully composed explications of @entity5 's unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy , taken from her journal entries , in studied accents somewhere between those of the @entity108 plains of @entity5 's birth and those of @entity111 in her most famous trouser - wearing , gumption - gal roles			1
ireport.com : share your movie reviews " @entity1 " dutifully conveys the salient biographical info with a trusty cinematic device : as @entity5 and @entity119 embark on their doomed flight , flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there			1
( @entity124 , as @entity119 , is the one understated player in this endeavor			0
) those last 10 minutes or so of radio - communications loss , concurrent instrument failure , and dawning awareness of disaster are honestly gripping			0
but just in case the point is n't clear enough ( she ! must ! fly ! ) , throughout the drama composer @entity133 lays on blasts of musical exclamations that are as distracting as sirens			0
sometimes that music says , " it 's great to be in the sky and surfing the clouds ! " sometimes it says , " look how pretty the landscape looks below -- kind of makes you miss the music in ' @entity145 , ' right ? " sometimes the rumble of violins and horns hints , " uh-oh , we 're getting to the tragic part of the story ! " mostly , the busy orchestra backs up the starry cinematography to remind us , " this slim , androgynous beauty , with her unusual love life and her driving need to take to the skies , sure was something , huh ? ! " whatever the message , there 's no navigating around such intrusive messengers			0

" @entity1 " hits viewers over the head with its themes , says @entity0
film stars @entity10 as aviator @entity5
" @entity1 " is flat and dull when it should be exciting
some of the *dialogue* is delivered as speeches : yawn
