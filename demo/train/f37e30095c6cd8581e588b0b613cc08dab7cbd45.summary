grand jury proceedings are secret , and when no indictment is handed down -- as was the case for @entity4 police officer @entity4 -- the files remain locked up			1
but in an unusual step after a grand jury deliberation , transcripts of testimony that jurors heard considering @entity10 's death have been released to the public			1
late monday night , officials made available 24 volumes of material , covering 23 meetings that the grand jury held between august 20 and november 21			1
a @entity1 team is going through all of the court documents			0
here 's what has emerged so far from that review : @entity4 had never fired his gun on duty before shooting @entity10 , he told the grand jury			1
asked if he had ever used excessive force before , he replied : " i 've never used my weapon before			0
" @entity4 called the area where @entity10 was shot a " hostile environment			1
" " there 's a lot of gangs that reside or associate with that area			2
there 's a lot of violence in that area , there 's a lot of gun activity , drug activity , it is just not a very well - liked community			2
that community does n't like the police			2
" what 's next for officer @entity4 ? @entity4 told the grand jury his original goal was to arrest @entity10 , after identifying him as a possible suspect in a shop theft			1
" my main goal was to keep eyes on him and just to keep him contained until i had people coming there , " he testified			2
" i knew i had already called for backup and i knew they were already in the area for the stealing that was originally reported			1
so i thought if i can buy 30 seconds of time , that was my original goal when i tried to get him to come to the car			0
if i could buy 30 seconds of time , someone else will be here , we can make the arrest , nothing happens , we are all good			0
and it did n't happen that way			0
" @entity4 told the grand jury he did n't normally carry a stun gun			1
" we only have a select amount			0
usually there is one available , but i usually elect not to carry one			0
it is not the most comfortable thing			0
i do n't have a lot of room in the front for it to be positioned , " he told the grand jury			1
the officer testified he was carrying mace when he encountered @entity10			1
officer @entity4 told the grand jury that @entity10 punched him in the face when the officer drove back to him			1
@entity4 said he tried to get out of his cruiser but @entity10 slammed the door shut twice and hit him with his fist			1
" i felt that another of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse ... i 've already taken two to the face and i did n't think i would , the third one could be fatal if he hit me right , " @entity4 said			1
twelve shots were fired by @entity4			1
@entity4 said two shots were fired during a struggle at his police vehicle and that he then fired three bursts of gunfire as he chased and then backed away from @entity10			1
he testified that his @entity105 .40 caliber gun held a maximum of 13 bullets			2
twelve casings were recovered and one bullet remained in the weapon , according to the grand jury documents			1
how prosecutor defended grand jury 's decision @entity4 testified he shot at @entity10 on the street when @entity10 turned on him			1
" as he is coming towards me , i tell , keep telling him to get on the ground , he does n't			0
i shoot a series of shots			0
i do n't know how many i shot , i just know i shot it , " he said			2
" i know i missed a couple , i do n't know how many , but i know i hit him at least once because i saw his body kind of jerk , " he said			0
@entity4 testified that @entity10 did not slow down			1
" at this point i start backpedaling and again , i tell him get on the ground , get on the ground , he does n't			0
i shoot another round of shots , " he said			0
" again , i do n't recall how many him every time			0
i know at least once because he flinched again			0
at this point it looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots , like it was making him mad that i 'm shooting at him			0
" and the face that he had was looking straight through me , like i was n't even there , i was n't even anything in his way			2
" he told the jurors he thought @entity10 was going to tackle him			1
" just coming straight at me like he was going to run right through me			0
and when he gets about that 8 to 10 feet away , i look down , i remember looking at my sites and firing , all i see is his head and that 's what i shot			2
" i do n't know how many , i know at least once because i saw the last one go into him			0
and then when it went into him , the demeanor on his face went blank , the aggression was gone , it was gone , i mean , i knew he stopped , the threat was stopped			2
" when he fell , he fell on his face			2
" @entity10 put his hand under his shirt into his waistband when he ran at @entity149 , @entity4 told the grand jury			1
" he turns , and when he looked at me , he made like a grunting , like aggravated sound and he starts , he turns and he 's coming back towards me , " @entity4 said			1
" his first step is coming towards me , he kind of does like a stutter step to start running			0
when he does that , his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his side , his right one goes under his shirt in his waistband and he starts running at me			0
" @entity4 was diagnosed with a bruised face after his confrontation with @entity10 , according to a medical report dated the day of the killing , august 9 , 2014			1
no other injuries were mentioned in the report			0
he was prescribed @entity166 , an anti-inflammatory medicine commonly used to treat pain			0
the medical investigator did not take photographs at the scene of @entity10 's killing because the camera battery had died , the grand jury heard			1
the investigator , who goes to the crime scene to collect evidence for the pathologist , also did not take measurements of anything at the scene because they " did n't need to			0
" the investigator , whose name was redacted , said : " it was self - explanatory what happened			0
there was no question as to any distances or anything of that nature at the time i was there			0
" typically , a medical investigator will take crime scene photos in addition to the ones taken by police investigators			2
