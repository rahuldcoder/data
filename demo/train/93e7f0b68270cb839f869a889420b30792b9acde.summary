@entity1 , @entity0 -- an eco-friendly @entity4 boat is hoping to successfully cross the perilous @entity6 sea passage that links the @entity7 with the @entity8			1
the old tug - boat , @entity10 , has been converted into an eco-friendly vessel with three sails and solar panels			1
" @entity10 " is attempting to navigate the icy , unpredictable @entity15 , a 6,000 mile passage that skims the northern coast of @entity18			1
it is a trip that only a handful of leisure boats in history have successfully completed			2
not only that , the modified tug boat is also attempting to do it ecologically			1
the boat 's crew is relying partly on wind - power to complete the route , parts of which are only free of ice for two short months during the @entity6 summer			1
three sails have been added to the tug boat , which normally runs on gas - guzzling motors			1
" ' @entity10 ' was the opposite of the ecological vessel , " @entity36 , captain and part - owner of the boat told @entity2			2
" what we wanted to do was create a symbol and show that even this type of boat can diversify its energy sources -- even in the most extreme conditions			0
" conditions on the route are treacherous : vessels that enter its waters at the wrong time can get trapped in thick ice for months in temperatures that go as low as -50c			1
ironically for the eco-expedition , it is receding ice levels , thought to be caused by global warming , that has crossing the passage a possibility once again in the last few years			0
the voyage , which is projected to take about six months , started in the @entity64 in april and , if they make it through the route successfully , will end in @entity68			1
the crew 's other ecological concessions include relying on solar panels for electricity and warm water , using only long - lasting led light bulbs and eating only organic products during their journey			1
on - board are seven adults and two children , including a painter , two writers , a scientist and a historian			0
currently , the team 's primary concern is not the fear of being trapped in ice and being forced to " hibernate " in @entity18 's frigid temperatures , but getting the required paperwork in time before the approaching colder months , which cause ice to harden in the passage			1
" @entity10 " is in @entity93 , @entity94 waiting for the green light from the @entity97 government , which rarely allows non-russian vessels to enter the passage			0
@entity97 reluctance may stem from the time of the @entity97 revolution in 1917 , after which the @entity103 was isolated from the @entity105			0
the @entity15 , which is the shortest passage between the @entity105 and the @entity107 , was also the only water the @entity97 could navigate without possible foreign interference			2
luckily , the crew have help from veteran sailors in their race against the clock : scientist @entity115 and sailor and @entity4 @entity117 who successfully sailed the @entity15 during the first ever circumnavigation of the glacial @entity6 in 2002			1
in the meantime , " @entity122 " is gaining increasing popularity with every port - of - call			0
the group is publicizing the cause ; inviting school children , academics and other tug boat sailors for workshops and tours of the boat			2
" the most difficult challenge seems to be convincing hardened tug boat captains to partially switch to wind power , " said @entity131 , who is in charge of communication and press for " @entity10			2
" " but change does n't happen in a day			0
" like @entity131 , each member of the team is responsible for delivering the message in a different way			0
two books , written in the style of travel journals are in the works and a documentary is currently being filmed			0
even the children have an important role -- reminding the adults why their mission is important			0
" i get the feeling that the two girls are really discovering life on this boat			0
they are learning to live simply , but beautifully			0
