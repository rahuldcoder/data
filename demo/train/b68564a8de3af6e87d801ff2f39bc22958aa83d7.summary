@entity0 -- congressional @entity2 and @entity3 escalated their rhetorical war thursday over a pending federal rule requiring religiously affiliated employers to provide full contraception coverage to women -- one day after hints emerged of a possible compromise between the @entity11 and conservative religious critics			1
numerous rank - and - file democrats urged the @entity11 not to back away from its support for the rule , while @entity3 demanded a full retreat			1
" it is time for the extreme right wing to stop playing football with women 's health , " said rep. @entity17 , @entity19 - @entity18			1
" my colleagues and i stand in solidarity with @entity27 women who have waited decades for equity in contraceptive coverage			1
we have fought for too long			0
" " i woke up this morning in the 21st century , not in the @entity31 , " said			0
" family planning and birth control ( are ) an essential part of women 's health			1
" but @entity3 presidential candidate @entity38 said the issue is about the rights of churches , not women			1
" this has to do with the right of a church not to spend their moral resources in a way that 's inconsistent with their faith , " the former @entity44 senator , a staunch conservative @entity45 , told @entity1 's " @entity53			1
" " we 're not talking about denying women the access to contraception , " he added			1
" they can go and get it			0
but we 're talking about having a church of which they happen to choose to work for , and they know their position in working for them			0
you 're now forcing them as a condition of employing people to pay for something that again is a grievous moral wrong			0
" and rep. @entity70 , @entity71 , called the proposed rule " an attack by the federal government on religious freedom for everyone in our country and our rights of conscience			1
" " it must not stand , and it will not stand , if we are going to keep the freedoms that we love and cherish in this country , " @entity70 said			0
@entity83 says the nation 's " culture wars " are back the question of whether institutions with religious ties should be required to offer insurance plans covering birth control and the so - called morning after pill , among other things , hits a number of political hot buttons			1
liberal groups defend the requirement on grounds of gender equality in health care ; conservatives consider it a violation of the @entity102 and an infringement on religious liberty			1
@entity3 leaders have repeatedly blasted the administration 's decision , raising the issue 's profile on both @entity110 and the presidential campaign trail			2
speaking on a @entity114 radio show thursday , vice president @entity112 said the @entity116 administration hopes to find a middle ground that would allow women to get insurance coverage for contraception while allowing an institution like the @entity122 , which opposes birth control , " to be consistent with its teachings			1
" " what i 'm making a commitment is there 's going to be a significant attempt to work this out , and there 's time to do that , " @entity112 said			1
" and as a practicing @entity45 , you know , i am of the view that this can be worked out and should be worked out			2
" @entity112 told radio station @entity134 that there has been " a lot of misunderstanding " about the rule			1
" there 's not enough focus on the fact that we 've decided that there 's a year to work this out so we can accommodate it , " he said			2
while churches themselves are exempt from the rule , hospitals and schools with religious affiliations would have to comply			1
the new policy is set to go into effect on august 1 , though religious groups would have a yearlong extension to implement the rule			2
published polls show a slight majority of @entity27 @entity122 actually favor the requirement			0
but the catholic media network @entity160 sued the federal government thursday , seeking to stop the mandate 's implementation and get it ruled unconstitutional			2
" we had no other option but to take this to the courts , " @entity160 president @entity165 said			0
" we are taking this action to defend not only ourselves but also to protect other institutions -- catholic and @entity172 , religious and secular -- from having this mandate imposed upon them			0
" two other lawsuits have also been filed seeking to block the mandate			0
all three lawsuits are backed by the @entity178 , a conservative religious legal organization			0
some political analysts think the controversy will cost president @entity116 votes in politically critical states like @entity44 and @entity183 in november , while others insist it will ultimately hurt @entity3 with suburban women			2
@entity186 reported wednesday that there was a deep internal administration split on the matter , with @entity112 and former white house chief of staff @entity190 warning @entity116 about the possibility of negative political repercussions in swing states , but several female aides -- including @entity197 secretary @entity196 -- urged the president to move forward with the rule , @entity186 said			1
@entity11 press secretary @entity200 denied the report , though he declined to offer any details			0
several high - profile @entity2 -- including @entity44 sen. @entity204 , @entity206 sen. @entity205 , @entity208 rep. @entity207 and former @entity210 chairman @entity209 -- pushed the @entity11 on wednesday to reconsider its position and expand the exemption for religious employers			2
@entity205 joined sen. @entity214 , @entity215 , in introducing legislation thursday that would immediately repeal the mandate			0
the reproductive health group @entity219 condemned the bill , arguing it would let any business lift birth - control coverage for its employees " on the basis of personal religious belief or moral conviction			1
" " it should not be left up to a boss 's personal beliefs whether his employees should be allowed birth control coverage , " @entity219 president @entity227 said in a written statement			1
" birth control is basic health care and women should have access to birth control , no matter where they work			1
that 's why a majority of @entity27 , including @entity122 , support the @entity116 administration 's birth control benefit			2
" but sen. @entity245 , @entity246 , suggested the @entity11 change its stance			0
" what i am urging is a compromise that respects the substantive goal of making sure that women have access and that no person is without the care , but at the same time that finds a way to respect issues of conscience and matters of religious belief			1
i think there is a balance , " @entity245 told reporters			0
" i do know the president is sensitive to this , " @entity245 said			0
policymakers are examining laws in 28 states that have similar coverage requirements , senior administration sources said			2
two sources have told @entity1 that the administration is particularly interested in the @entity274 model , in which female employees of religious institutions can purchase contraceptive coverage directly from the insurer at the same price offered to employees of all other employers			1
another possible solution , one source said , would be legislation allowing women employed by religiously affiliated employers to get contraceptive insurance from the exchanges created under @entity116 's sweeping health care reform rather than from their employer 's insurer			1
sources familiar with @entity11 thinking said the administration is is convinced approval from conservative @entity122 is out of reach and is trying to win over progressive @entity122			0
@entity18 archbishop @entity297 , head of the @entity298 , said thursday that the decision to require full contraception coverage was a " terribly misguided judgment			1
" " we ca n't compromise on principle			0
that 's almost rewarding bad behavior , " @entity297 told " @entity306			2
" on wednesday , house speaker @entity307 , @entity308 , called the policy an " unambiguous attack on religious freedom " and announced his chamber would pursue legislative action to prevent the rule from going into effect			2
and on the presidential campaign trail , @entity3 front - runner @entity316 has pledged to eliminate the rule on his first day in office			2
both the @entity11 and @entity316 's @entity3 opponents , however , have noted a @entity246 law in effect , while @entity316 was governor that required hospitals -- including @entity45 ones -- to provide emergency contraception to rape victims			1
it 's ironic for @entity316 to criticize " the president for pursuing a policy that is virtually identical to the one that was in place when he was governor of @entity246 , " @entity200 said wednesday			2
@entity316 , in turn , said @entity200 needs to " check his history			0
" in 2005 then - gov. @entity316 vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals -- including @entity45 hospitals -- to provide emergency contraception			1
the heavily @entity210 state legislature overrode his veto			0
according to news reports at the time , @entity316 initially said his administration would not enforce the law at @entity45 hospitals			0
but he later reversed course , saying all hospitals would have to supply the morning - after pill			0
@entity316 was quoted at the time as saying , " my personal view in my heart of hearts is that people who are subject to rape should have the option of having emergency contraception or emergency contraception information			2
" " i worked very hard to get the legislature to remove all of the mandated coverages , including contraception , " @entity316 told reporters wednesday			1
this " was a provision that got there before i did , and it was one that i fought to remove			0
" @entity316 's campaign released a statement from former @entity27 ambassador to the @entity370 @entity369 on thursday defending @entity316 's past stance on the issue			0
" the charge that @entity316 has not stood tall to defend freedom of religion is preposterous , " @entity373 said			0
" he has shown backbone on every critical issue at every juncture when it counted			0
" @entity1 's @entity380 , @entity381 , @entity382 , @entity383 , @entity384 , @entity385 , and @entity386 contributed to this report			0

@entity389 : " this can be worked out , " @entity112 says
@entity38 says it 's not about women , it 's about churches ' rights
@entity219 says access to contraception is " basic health care "
the pending rule says religiously affiliated employers must provide full contraception coverage
