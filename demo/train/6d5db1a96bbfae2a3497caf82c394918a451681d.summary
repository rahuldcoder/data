-- based on the hundreds of e-mails , @entity2 comments and tweets i 've read in response to my denunciation of @entity9 gov. @entity8 's decision to honor @entity10 for their involvement in the @entity13 -- which was based on the desire to continue slavery -- the one consistent thing that supporters of the proclamation offer up as a defense is that these individuals were fighting for what they believed in and defending their homeland			1
in criticizing me for saying that celebrating the @entity10 was akin to honoring @entity26 soldiers for killing of @entity28 during the @entity29 , @entity24 said , " i am simply defending the honor and dignity of men who were given no choice other than to fight , some as young as thirteen			1
" @entity35 said that supporting the @entity36 is " our history			1
not hate ; it 's about heritage and history			0
" @entity41 called slavery evil , but prefaced his remarks by saying that " @entity36 soldiers were never seen as terrorists by [ president @entity46 ] @entity48 or @entity49 generals on the battlefield			1
they were accorded pow status , they were never tried for war crimes			0
not once did @entity36 soldiers do any damage to civilians or their property in their invasion of the north			1
the same is not true of @entity61 soldiers			2
" @entity62 sent me a tweet saying , " slavery is appalling , but was not the only reason for the @entity67 [ @entity13 ]			1
those men , while misguided on some fronts stood up for what they felt was right			0
they embodied that @entity49 ideal that the states have a right to govern themselves			0
@entity75 is what a confederate soldier stood for			0
" if you take all of these comments , do n't they sound eerily similar to what we hear today from @entity85 extremists who have pledged their lives to defend the honor of @entity88 and to defeat the infidels in the @entity90 ? when you make the argument that the @entity93 was angry with the @entity94 for " invading " its " homeland , " @entity91 has said the same about @entity49 soldiers being on @entity97 soil			2
he has objected to our bases in @entity99 , and that 's one of the reasons he has launched his jihad against us			0
is there really that much of a difference between him and the @entity10 ? same language ; same cause ; same effect			2
if a @entity36 soldier was merely doing his job in defending his homeland , honor and heritage , what are we to say about young @entity85 radicals who say the exact same thing as their rationale for strapping bombs on their bodies and blowing up cafes and buildings ? if the @entity124 use as a talking point the vicious manner in which people in the @entity93 were treated by the @entity94 , does n't that sound exactly like the @entity129 saying they want to kill @entity49 for the slaughter of innocent people in @entity132 ? defenders of the @entity36 say that innocent people were killed in the @entity13 ; has n't the same argument been presented by @entity85 radicals in @entity137 , @entity132 and other places where the @entity49 has tangled with terrorists ? we ca n't on the one hand justify the actions of @entity10 as being their duty as valiant men of the @entity93 , and then condemn the @entity85 extremists who want to see @entity49 die a brutal death			1
these men are held up as honorable by their brethren , so why do @entity49 see them as different from our homegrown terrorists ? the fundamental problem with extremism is that when you 're on the side that is fanatical , all of your actions make sense to you , and you are fluent in trying to justify every action			0
every position of those you oppose is a personal affront that calls for you to do what you think is necessary to protect yourself and your family			0
just as radical @entity85 have a warped sense of religion , @entity36 supporters have a delusional view of what is honorable			2
the terrorists are willing to kill their own to prove their point , and the @entity10 were just as willing in the @entity13 to take up arms against their fellow @entity49 to justify their point			1
even if you 're a relative of one of the 9/11 hijackers , that man was an out - and - out terrorist , and nothing you can say will change that			0
and if your great - great - great - granddaddy was a @entity36 who stood up for @entity93 ideals , he too was a terrorist			2
as a matter of conscience , i will not justify , understand or accept the atrocious view of @entity85 terrorists that their actions represent a just war			0
they are reprehensible , and their actions a sin against humanity			0
and i will never , under any circumstances , cast @entity10 as heroic figures who should be honored and revered			1
no -- they were , and forever will be , domestic terrorists			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 says defenders of @entity36 soldiers say they were protecting their homeland
he says the @entity13 was fought over slavery , an *indefensible* *institution*
@entity198 says *modern* terrorists also say they are defending their homeland
he says @entity10 should not be honored but should be considered " domestic terrorists "
