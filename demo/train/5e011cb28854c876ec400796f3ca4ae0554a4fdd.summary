-- @entity1 , blithe impersonator of obtuse elves , tv anchormen , and former presidents , is not the first actor one thinks of to play @entity6 , an alcoholic wretch on a bender , in the sober indie drama " @entity10			1
" on one rock - bottom day , @entity6 is fired from his sales job and his wife leaves him , having first changed the locks and piled all his possessions in their suburban front yard			2
the sight of indoor stuff splayed outdoors may be absurd			0
but there is nothing at all funny about the pathetic mess @entity6 continues to make of his life			0
and @entity1 , whose vaguely uncomprehending onscreen stare usually signals amusing male cluelessness to come , upends expectations from the very first scene , as @entity6 sits in his car , locked in a traffic standstill and palpably unable to endure the stress without a pull on his liquor flask			2
with characteristic physical fearlessness , the actor becomes a downward - spiraling alcoholic			0
it 's a terrific performance -- one that 's unmatched by the rest of the movie , written and directed by @entity40			1
based on @entity42 's notable short story '' @entity43 ? , '' " @entity10 " is a sweetened - up , padded - out scenario of hope cracking through a drunk 's despair			0
@entity40 's background as a director of commercials is evident in his feature - film debut : everything and everyone look 10 degrees softer and more composed than they need to be			1
@entity42 's original minimalist story goes down in two gulps : the drinking guy sells his stuff to a young couple passing by			0
@entity40 's adaptation skips the young couple , expands the yard sale , and adds a cop who 's @entity6 's aa sponsor ( @entity65 )			1
@entity0 : see all of this week 's reviews there 's also : a lonely black kid who becomes @entity6 's protégé ( @entity69 ) ; an old high school classmate ( @entity70 , in a fine , subtle , self - contained scene ) who assures @entity6 that he really does have a heart ; and a neighbor across the street ( @entity73 ) who 's pregnant			1
despite @entity6 's worst , hurtful behavior toward her , she 's willing to extend a kind of forgiveness			1
@entity1 , for his part , looks like he would have no problem going even deeper and darker than @entity40 could bear			2
like @entity81 and @entity82 before him , this funnyman reveals serious acting chops			0
