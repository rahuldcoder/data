so after all the hype , was the lost sleep and the sore necks from looking at the sky worth it ? people throughout @entity5 could ask that question saturday , hours after witnessing a unique meteor shower that was visible in the middle of the night			1
judging from social media responses , this cosmic event appeared to have little bang in some places , while delivering a few prize goods elsewhere			0
but for die - hard star geeks , there will be an @entity16 , an even bigger treat , as the last part of the shower -- a comet -- passes by @entity21 , beginning saturday evening			1
whatever the verdict , there will probably never be a second chance for the @entity26 meteor shower			1
many showers come annually , in october , december , january and april , said @entity29 meteor observer @entity28			1
in august , for example , we will see the return of the spectacular @entity34 meteor shower			1
but the @entity26 shower , named for the constellation the shooting stars appeared to fly out of , was a rare gift from the planet @entity40			1
the biggest planet in the solar system bent the meteors ' orbit with its powerful gravitational pull so that they would collide with @entity21			1
" next year , it will tug the debris field away from the @entity21 , and we wo n't see a meteor shower , so this is kind of a one - shot deal , " @entity28 said			1
rare comet pass the debris field derives from the coming comet , which bears the uninspiring name @entity52			1
astronomers have stopped coming up with fancy nomenclature for the hundreds of comets they spot and instead give each new one a number and the name of the project that discovered it			0
@entity40 will fling the comet our way , too , causing it to fly by our planet at a distance of 5 million miles			2
" a comfortable distance , which is good , " @entity28 said			0
its core is 1 to 2 miles wide , and a direct hit to @entity21 would be disastrous			1
even though @entity52 passes by every five years while orbiting the sun , this time around it will offer a rare sight to hobby astronomers			1
" the comet normally does n't pass this close , " @entity28 said			1
anyone with a consumer model 3 - inch - reflector telescope should be able to see it in the north sky late wednesday , if the heavens are clear			2
those who want a sneak peek through a more powerful telescope can get it from 6 p.m. et saturday via the online observatory service @entity86			1
to have @entity52 's debris field pass the @entity21 ahead of its comet is like putting the tail before the dog			1
usually debris fields follow comets just like their tails do			0
again , @entity40 was the culprit			0
it ripped off the debris field and threw it out in front of @entity52			1
" @entity40 is a big gravitational bully of the solar system , " @entity28 said			0
this particular comet and its field just happen to pass through that planet 's orbit			1
after many passes around the solar system , the comet also does n't have much of a tail left , so gazers should n't expect to see a long , stunning ribbon trailing it , just a short dash			2
surprise package @entity28 said from the start that the @entity26 could be a star - studded gala or a dud			2
@entity29 could n't predict it ahead of time , because the debris field was formed some 200 years ago , when astronomers could n't see it , @entity28 said			2
they merely knew that it was coming			0
" it 's kind of like being able to predict rain at 11:30 in the morning but not being able to predict a drizzle or a thunderstorm			2
" reactions from shooting - star gazers across the country ran the gamut on social media , and judging by some , it did deliver fireworks			0
" @entity132 and i literally just saw and heard a meteor explode right before our eyes , "			2
@entity137 posted to @entity138 " just saw a awesomely bright meteor with a blue tail ! ! # @entity143 , " @entity138 user @entity139 said from @entity140			2
but it served up some anticlimax , too			0
a few netizens called it a complete bust			0
@entity149 had only one word to describe the event : " disappointing			0
" @entity152 stayed up for more than seven hours to watch the much anticipated meteor shower from @entity154 near @entity155 , @entity156			1
despite the poor showing , @entity152 still managed to photograph a few passing meteors overhead			0
but the night was not a complete loss			0
" it was a great excuse to spend the night out in a remote area with some good friends and enjoy the night and the first fireflies of the season , which sometimes we would think for a fraction of a second were meteors , " he said			0
despite the lackluster showing , @entity170 enjoyed staying up to watch the celestial event			0
she photographed the meteor shower over @entity174 in @entity175 , and she was n't alone			1
there were dozens of other photographers camped out at the lake hoping to catch a glimpse of @entity26			1
" there were many photographers there			0
all you could see were the lights of their cameras scattered around the lake , " she wrote			0
" guess anyone who invited someone on a date to watch the ' meteor shower ' is looking like a pretty big creep right about now , " @entity190 @entity189 tweeted			1
some found moments of serendipity in the event			0
@entity200 , a @entity201 astrophotographer and @entity202 , wrote that he was shooting time exposures for the meteor shower when he noticed the @entity206 " creeping along the horizon			1
" " quickly setting up a shot , i also captured a meteor in the upper right of photo , " he said			2
a tweet from @entity213 reporter @entity212 seemed to sum up neatly reactions to the shower			0
" watched the # @entity26 from the @entity216			2
not exactly a meteor storm , but the 3 i saw were so cool			0
long streaks across the sky			0
" @entity220 - inspiring photos : ' blood moon ' mesmerizes sky gazers astronaut tells kid , ' you 'd love it up here '			0

may @entity26 meteor shower *dazzles* some , bores others
but it 's *connected* to a comet making a rare close pass by @entity21 , @entity29 says
you can see @entity52 with a telescope
or you can catch it online at observatory service @entity86
