to the casual onlooker golf is often perceived as behind the times due to the archaic rules and regulations which govern the game			0
but even the most old - fashioned sport is powerless beneath the wheels of change and with the @entity9 , golf was recently given a 21st - century makeover			1
the inaugural competition took place recently in @entity13 pitting eight city franchises against each other in a floodlit tournament which boasted a $ 400,000 prize fund and starred major winners @entity19 and @entity20			1
the " @entity9 " format is not new to sports fans , with cricket already having undergone a similar reinvention in the subcontinent with the lucrative @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
the @entity26 is played in packed stadiums at a frantic pace , with superstar players on big - money short - term contracts letting rip in the 20 - over competition			1
both golf and cricket are sports which traditionally last for days at a time			2
but does that gentle sporting rhythm -- so reminiscent of yesteryear -- no longer excite a modern audience short on time and attention ? " it 's all about thrills and spills these days , " @entity41 , author of @entity42 , told @entity43			2
" just look at the popularity of @entity48 cricket in @entity49 and the sell - out stadiums			1
compare that to the empty spaces at five - day test matches			0
" it 's not just @entity49 which has a thirst for ' immediate ' action and a disinterest for the nuances and chess - like formats			1
" most countries have seen spikes in interest in shorter formats of cricket			2
@entity65 wants to set up a t20 league , so does the @entity67			0
" the financial benefits are obvious			0
@entity69 recently signed a deal worth rs.396.8 crore ( $ 71.93 million ) to sponsor the nine - franchise @entity26 competition , which gets underway again in april , for five seasons			1
television money that figure doubled the league 's previous sponsorship agreement and @entity41 is n't surprised , suggesting shorter games are more appealing to broadcasters			2
" there is money there , unlike test matches , " added @entity41			0
" a broadcaster would far rather commit to a three - hour show than one over five days spanning seven hours each and have the possibility that it could be rained off or end two days early			0
" so now golf bravely follows where cricket has led			2
rather than 18 holes , players in the @entity90 played over just 14 with each golfer decked out in their team 's jersey			1
in the end , it was @entity20 's @entity97 which won the inaugural competition , with the franchise paying $ 55,000 for the services of the @entity101 during the event			1
does this new golf experiment signal the imminent demise of more traditional forms of sport ? " this is significant and fundamental because it is changing the very nature of sport : the formats , " @entity107 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity109 , told @entity43			2
" the rules , the way in which they are commercialized and marketed , the way in which sport has become a commodity and somehow seems to be morphing into an entertainment product , the way in which sport is consumed			0
" these fast - paced , short forms of sport are ideal for a country which , like its @entity129 counterparts @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , is very much on the up			0
" @entity49 is fast paced , " continued @entity41			1
" it 's a society which wants everything and five minutes ago			0
it wants to be seen as leading new trends and in that regard quickfire golf certainly does that			0
" it 's a vibrant , cocksure country these days , a coming force and they are keen to show that off			0
" @entity140 has its popularity in @entity49 but , frankly , every kid carries a cricket bat with them , not a five - iron and in that regard the sport has an ' elite ' image			1
" now it could be that they are trying to shake off that stereotype but more likely i think this might be down to some rich folk wanting to have some fun and getting tv deals and sponsorships to pay for it			0
" hybrid approach @entity107 outlines how tinkering with the conventions of sport is an attempt to attract audiences whose interests might ordinarily lie elsewhere			0
he also suggest the trend could continue , as @entity166 's financial power continues to grow			0
" there 's the development of new format sports that are intended to deliver a ' better product ' , which often border on entertainment and celebrity rather than pure sport , " said @entity107			1
" there 's the change in sporting model , with the rise of @entity166 markets resulting in the emergence of hybrid approaches to sport			1

eight franchises were pitted together in a cut down *version* of the sport
the format is similar to cricket 's @entity26 , which was *launched* in 2008
