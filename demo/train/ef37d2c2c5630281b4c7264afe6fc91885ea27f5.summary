the @entity0 on wednesday said it is looking into an @entity2 report that a league executive in april received from a law enforcement official a copy of the video in which @entity7 punched his now - wife in the face			1
the law enforcement official had a short voice mail from april 9 in which someone calling from a number at an @entity0 office thanks the official , the @entity2 reported			1
the caller says of the video , " you 're right			0
it 's terrible , " according to the @entity2 the league has denied that anyone in its office had seen the video before monday , when it was posted online			1
when asked about the @entity2 report , an @entity0 spokesman said the league will investigate the validity of the story			1
" we have no knowledge of this			0
we are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on monday			2
we will look into it , " @entity35 said			0
the @entity2 story said the law enforcement official requested anonymity because of an ongoing investigation and did n't name the @entity0 executive because that would make it easy to identify the @entity2 's source			1
the source told @entity2 he sent the video on a dvd to an @entity0 office			1
" the person said he was unauthorized to release the video but shared it unsolicited , because he wanted the @entity0 to have it before deciding on @entity7 's punishment , " the @entity2 wrote			1
@entity0 commissioner @entity51 told @entity52 in an interview aired wednesday that the league asked for the video on several occasions , but was denied access			1
" i understand that there may be legal restrictions on them sharing that with us , " he said			0
@entity63 's @entity62 said the @entity2 report , if true , is extremely damaging to the @entity0 's and @entity51 's reputation			1
" this is a huge problem , and not just for the public , " she said			0
" we now have @entity0 players coming out against this because @entity51 is either flat - out lying about having seen the video , or he is admitting to gross , gross negligence that this was in his office and he did n't see the video			1
" late wednesday , the @entity0 announced that former fbi director @entity75 will lead an independent inquiry into the league 's investigation and gathering of evidence in the case			1
@entity51 said @entity75 will have access to all @entity0 records , spokesman @entity82 said			1
two @entity0 owners who are attorneys -- @entity86 of the @entity87 and @entity88 of the @entity89 -- will oversee the independent probe			2
@entity75 was director of the @entity91 from 2001 to 2013			2
the @entity92 called @entity75 's appointment " just window dressing , " saying it does n't go far enough			1
" now continues to ask for @entity51 to resign , and for his successor to appoint an independent investigator with full authority to gather factual data about domestic violence , dating violence , sexual assault and stalking within the entire @entity0 community - not just regarding the @entity7 incident - and to recommend real and lasting reforms , " said @entity95 , president of the @entity92			1
@entity0 says it tried to get footage in a memo to @entity0 owners , the commissioner reiterated that position , saying the @entity0 asked for the videos in february and in may			2
@entity114 law prohibits their release while a police investigation is under way , @entity51 wrote in the memo			0
the league did n't ask a casino in @entity121 , @entity114 , for the video , @entity51 said			1
on february 15 , @entity7 , released monday by the @entity123 , and his then - fiancee , @entity124 , got into an altercation on an elevator in the casino in @entity121			1
@entity7 floored @entity124 with a punch to the head then dragged her -- face down -- out of the elevator			2
the incident was captured on casino surveillance cameras			0
@entity132 obtained two videos from the footage taken that night			0
it posted the first one , which showed @entity7 dragging his then - fiancee out of the elevator , in february			1
the in - elevator video showing the violent punch was put online on monday			1
' we dropped the ball , ' @entity123 owner says it was that second video that changed @entity123 owner @entity147 's perception of the incident			0
@entity147 , who told @entity63 affiliate @entity149 that he never spoke with @entity7 , said he did n't realize the blow that knocked @entity151 out was so forceful			2
" the way it was described to us was that he had hit her with an open hand and that she had hit her head ( as she fell ) , " @entity147 told @entity149			0
he told the station that the way he pictured it in his mind @entity151 was " wailing " on her then - fiance when he slapped her and she was close to the wall and hit her head , knocking her out			0
" so why did i conclude all of that ? because i wanted to , because i loved him , because he had a stellar record , " @entity147 said			0
he added his thinking was also shaped by the fact that police only arrested the couple for misdemeanors			0
@entity7 's charge was later changed to a felony , and @entity124 's charge was dropped			2
@entity51 sickened by monday 's video @entity7 was suspended indefinitely by the league and is in a pretrial intervention program in the @entity114 legal system that will allow him to avoid jail time			1
initially he had been suspended for two games of the 16 - game season , a decision by @entity51 that was widely criticized			0
many commentators have argued the first video @entity132 posted was evidence enough for a harsher penalty			0
and @entity0 investigators should have had access to the complaint summons from the case			2
the @entity192 posted part of the document february 19			0
the complaint says @entity7 was charged with assault by attempting to cause bodily harm , " specifically by striking her with his hand , rendering her unconscious			2
" @entity51 told @entity52 that he was sickened by what he saw on the newly released video and that it was the first time he had seen the full scope of the february incident			0
he also deflected criticism of his handling of @entity7 's case and his initial lenient penalty for the domestic violence incident			2
" what we saw in the first videotape was troubling to us in and of itself , " @entity51 said , referring to another video that surfaced in february after the incident , showing @entity7 dragging his then - fiancee out of the elevator			1
" but what we saw yesterday was extremely clear			0
it was extremely graphic and it was sickening			0
" a timeline of key events @entity0 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story '			0

@entity75 to lead inquest into how @entity0 handled its investigation into @entity7 case
@entity92 says investigation is n't enough
@entity2 reports @entity0 executive received a copy of in - elevator video in april
@entity0 says it is *unaware* of anyone in league office watching video before this week
