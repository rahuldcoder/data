if there is one regional player that gained the most from @entity5 's gamble in @entity6 , it is @entity8			1
with its invasion in 2003 , the @entity5 ousted @entity11 's sworn enemy , @entity10 , from power			2
then @entity13 helped install a @entity15 government for the first time in @entity6 's modern history			0
as @entity5 troops became mired in fighting an insurgency and containing a civil war , @entity8 extended its influence over all of @entity6 's major @entity15 factions			1
today , the @entity8 regime is moving to exert influence beyond its @entity6 proxies , and is comfortable taking overt military action			1
there is no one to restrain @entity11 , and the rise of @entity30 , which views @entity15 as apostates , threatens the interests of all @entity6 @entity15 factions and of the @entity8 regime			1
in late november , @entity8 warplanes launched several airstrikes against targets in eastern @entity6 , pushing back @entity30 militants who had neared a self - declared " buffer zone " that @entity8 established along the border			1
it was the latest example of how @entity8 is expanding its military and political influence in @entity6 , a country wracked by a complex civil war that leaves it open to outside manipulation			1
@entity6 is at the center of several regional proxy battles : @entity8 is heavily involved in shaping @entity6 policy , while @entity30 represents spillover from the @entity50 civil war next door			1
the militant group is also a byproduct of the @entity54 that support @entity56 jihadists in both @entity50 and @entity6			0
and the @entity5 is bombing isis and other jihadist groups in @entity6 and @entity50			0
opinion : @entity8 's hypocrisy in condemning @entity5 the @entity8 regime has several concerns : @entity6 provides strategic depth and a buffer against @entity64 and other @entity56 @entity66 states that are competing with @entity8 for dominance over the @entity68			1
more broadly , @entity11 wants to ensure that @entity6 never again poses an existential threat to @entity8 interests , as @entity10 did when he invaded @entity8 in 1980 , instigating the eight - year @entity72 that devastated both countries			1
@entity10 was supported by the @entity74 and most western powers			0
( the @entity15 are the majority in @entity6 , but since its independence in 1932 , the country had been ruled by the @entity56 minority until the @entity5 invasion in 2003			0
) @entity8 will do whatever is necessary to keep a friendly , @entity15 - led government in power in @entity84			2
the long game @entity8 has excelled at playing the long game , especially in @entity6			1
@entity8 's willingness to spread money around to various proxies and factions gave it great agility in maneuvering through @entity6 politics			1
soon after the @entity5 invasion , @entity11 reached out to the @entity15 cleric @entity93 -- who was an early critic of @entity8 meddling in @entity6 -- and financed his growing militia and social service networks			1
one diplomatic cable sent by @entity99 @entity98 to officials at the @entity101 in november 2009 estimated that @entity11 's financial assistance to its @entity6 surrogates ranged from $ 100 million to $ 200 million a year			0
@entity8 also was willing to invest across sectarian lines : " the @entity105 ( @entity106 ) recognizes that influence in @entity6 requires operational ( and at times ideological ) flexibility , " ambassador @entity98 pointed out in his cable			1
" as a result , it is not uncommon for the @entity105 to finance and support competing @entity15 , @entity113 , and to some extent , @entity56 entities , with the aim of developing the @entity6 body politic 's dependency on @entity11 's largesse			0
" like @entity6 's other neighbors , @entity8 helped fuel and prolong the @entity6 insurgency and civil war			1
the @entity124 financed , armed and trained numerous @entity15 militias that targeted @entity5 troops and @entity6 's @entity56 community			0
the @entity8 provided rockets , explosives , machine guns , sniper rifles , rocket - propelled grenades and other small arms			0
they also brought @entity6 militiamen to @entity8 to be trained in the use of explosives and as snipers			1
the @entity5 helped @entity6 's @entity15 factions compromise on @entity139 as prime minister in 2006			0
as he struggled to remain in power , he became more dependent on @entity8			2
he grew more repressive and authoritarian , using the @entity6 security forces to intimidate political rivals and exclude @entity56 from power			2
for @entity8 , @entity139 was a reliable ally , who allowed @entity8 flights over @entity6 territory to transport weapons and manpower to shore up @entity150 's regime in @entity50 after a popular uprising in 2011			1
@entity139 also allowed thousands of @entity6 @entity15 to cross the border and fight alongside the @entity50 regime			0
since @entity30 swept through northern @entity6 in june , @entity11 has mobilized to protect the @entity15 - led government from the @entity56 militant threat			1
general @entity156 , commander of the @entity157 of the @entity124 , traveled to @entity84 at the start of the crisis to coordinate the defense of the capital with @entity6 politicians and military officials			0
he also directed @entity8 - trained @entity15 militias — including the @entity165 and the @entity166 , two notorious militias responsible for widespread atrocities against @entity56 — in the fight against @entity30			1
with a weakened and corrupt @entity6 military , the militias have proven crucial in stopping @entity30 ' advance			1
when @entity6 's political elite finally agreed in august to replace the divisive and sectarian @entity139 as prime minister , the @entity8 leadership — along with the @entity5 and most western powers — threw their weight behind his successor , @entity179			1
like @entity139 , he is a leader of the @entity180 , a @entity181 supported by @entity8			0
in recent months , @entity5 officials say , @entity11 has provided tons of military equipment to the @entity6 security forces and has been secretly directing surveillance drones from an air base in @entity84			0
@entity8 has also sent hundreds of its @entity157 fighters to train @entity6 forces and coordinate their actions			1
but last month was the first time that @entity8 used its fighter jets to directly bomb @entity30 targets inside @entity6 , striking in eastern @entity195 province where the fighting neared the @entity8 border			1
@entity8 officials have slowly acknowledged their covert operations inside @entity6			1
" @entity8 has helped @entity6 in an advisory role and has quickly organized @entity6 militias , " gen. @entity200 , commander of the @entity124 ' @entity201 , told the @entity202 in september			2
" were it not for @entity8 , the @entity205 would have taken over @entity206			0
" in late december , a @entity124 commander , brigadier general @entity207 , was killed by a sniper in the @entity6 city of @entity210 while he was training @entity6 troops and @entity15 militia fighters			0
@entity207 was the highest - ranking @entity8 official to be killed in @entity6 since the @entity72			2
thousands of @entity124 gathered for his funeral in @entity11 on dec. 28 , where @entity214 , head of @entity8 's @entity215 , told mourners : if " people like @entity207 do not shed their blood in @entity210 , then we would shed our blood " within @entity8			0
@entity6 leaders warned that as long as the @entity5 did not provide military assistance , they had no choice but to ask @entity8 for more help			2
" when @entity84 was threatened , the @entity8 did not hesitate to help us , " @entity179 , the @entity6 prime minister , said in a recent television interview in @entity84			2
he noted that unlike @entity8 , the @entity5 " hesitated to help us when @entity84 was in danger , and hesitated to help our security forces			0
and the reason @entity8 did not hesitate to help us was because they consider @entity30 as a threat to them , not only to us			2
" the proxy wars today 's @entity233 was shaped by several proxy wars that unfolded over the past decade			0
in @entity6 , neighboring @entity56 regimes backed @entity56 militants , while @entity8 supported @entity139 's @entity15 - led government and @entity15 militias			2
in @entity239 , an alliance between @entity13 and authoritarian @entity56 @entity66 regimes — @entity242 , @entity64 and other @entity68 countries — backed a @entity56 - led government against @entity245 , a @entity15 militia funded by @entity8			0
and in the @entity247 territories , @entity8 supported the militant @entity248 , while the @entity5 and its @entity66 allies backed @entity247 president @entity250 and his @entity252 movement			0
when various @entity233 regimes realized that @entity5 would lose its war in @entity6 , they began maneuvering to protect their interests and to gain something out of the @entity5 defeat			0
@entity64 , which viewed @entity6 as a bulwark against @entity8 influence , tried to undermine the @entity15 - led government in @entity84			1
the ruling @entity264 dynasty views itself as the rightful leader of the @entity267 world , but @entity8 has challenged that leadership for several decades			0
although @entity64 has a @entity56 majority , its rulers fear @entity8 's potential influence over a sizable and sometimes - restive @entity15 population concentrated in the kingdom 's oil - rich @entity273			2
in @entity277 ( another @entity5 ally in the @entity68 ) , the @entity15 majority is chafing under @entity56 rulers who also fear @entity8 's reach			0
through a combination of funding , training for militias and political support , @entity8 will continue to extend its influence over the major @entity15 groups in @entity6			1
@entity139 did not start out as beholden to @entity8 , but as he struggled to remain in power , he became more dependent on @entity11			2
even if @entity179 , the new prime minister , has shown signs that he wants to be closer to the @entity291 , he needs @entity8 support to keep his government in power			0
more broadly , the @entity5 and @entity8 now share common interests in defeating @entity30 and maintaining a stable regime in @entity84 that can transcend sectarian conflicts			2
the @entity298 administration and @entity11 insist that they are not coordinating directly in @entity6 , but they essentially have an undeclared alliance			0
@entity13 has been looking the other way as @entity8 increased its military involvement over the past six months			0
without committing far more @entity5 troops and resources , there is little that the @entity298 administration can do to contain @entity8 power in @entity6			1
@entity8 has many levers to maintain its influence over @entity6			1
it will not hesitate to use them , even if that means taking on a deeper military role in a civil war that has no end in sight .			0

@entity315 says @entity8 is free to exercise power in *vacuum* created by fall of @entity10
he says @entity8 is expanding its influence in @entity6 , *partly* to counter @entity30
