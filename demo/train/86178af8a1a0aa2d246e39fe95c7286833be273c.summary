-- in the 1960s and 1970s , @entity1 was widely viewed as the model for effective special - interest lobbying			1
bans on public smoking have been on the rise in recent years			2
" my own view is that in many ways , the tobacco industry invented the kind of special - interest lobbying that has become so characteristic of the late 20th - and earlier 21st - century @entity16 politics , " said @entity8 , dean of @entity10 's @entity9			1
the industry was known for its giant spending on political campaigns and effective lobbyists			1
the industry 's representatives often had experience in politics or close ties to major power players			2
" today obviously , that lobby is much less powerful and successful than it was a generation ago , " said @entity8 , author of " the @entity27 : the @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 of the @entity33			2
" the industry is now facing regulation by the @entity36 , and although one major cigarette company supported the @entity36 bill , the legislation is widely viewed as a sign that tobacco is finding fewer friends in @entity43			1
the lobby began to lose power as the industry lost credibility , @entity8 said			2
in the 1950s and 1960s , the lobby centered attention on the notion that the science of tobacco was uncertain , and it called into question each medical and scientific finding that came out as it continued to spend " boatloads " of money in @entity54 , @entity8 noted			1
in 1964 , the surgeon general report officially recognized the health risks of tobacco			2
at the time , about 42 percent of adults in the @entity16 smoked , compared with about 20 percent today			0
at the time , cigarettes were hardly viewed as the enemy			0
tobacco companies sponsored game shows and cartoons , and cigarette ads featured endorsements from doctors , dentists and celebrities			2
@entity54 in 1965 required that all cigarette packages carry warning labels , ones that were made under the surgeon general 's name five years later			1
by 1970 , television and radio advertisements were banned			0
by 1988 , smoking was banned on @entity16 flights two hours or less , and 10 years later , all @entity16 carrier flights became smoke - free			0
@entity81 , who appeared in the " @entity83 " ads , developed lung cancer in the late 1980s and started an anti-smoking campaign			0
shortly before cancer took his life in 1992 , a television ad ran showing images of him as a handsome cowboy next to those of him in his hospital bed			0
five years later , under pressure from the public and @entity54 , the @entity93 voluntarily ended its use of " @entity97 " as the mascot for @entity100 cigarettes			1
a 1991 study published in @entity102 found that 6 - year - olds could just as easily recognize @entity104 as @entity105			0
as skepticism from the public crept up , @entity1 's power began to erode			1
the industry was hit with a big blow in 1998 when it agreed to a $ 206 billion master settlement with 46 states , the largest settlement in @entity16 history			1
the case settled @entity117 lawsuits against the top tobacco companies			2
the 40 - year - old @entity119 and the @entity120 -- the public relations organ and the funder of tobacco research -- were disbanded as a part of the settlement			1
and just last month , in what @entity8 considers " one of the most significant racketeering and fraud litigations " the @entity125 upheld @entity16 district judge @entity131 's ruling in a @entity133 , or @entity133 , case , which found the tobacco industry guilty of engaging in a decades - long conspiracy to defraud the @entity16 public about the health risks of tobacco			1
" given the character of @entity131 's findings -- and now the fact that her findings have been upheld by the appeals court -- this is really in a way a road map to tobacco regulation , " @entity8 said			2
@entity148 , a longtime anti-tobacco advocate and director of the @entity150 at the @entity151 , said the @entity133 ruling is what the public health community should use in its fight against the tobacco industry			1
" i think it really can undermine the power of the industry politically by going to politicians and saying , ' these guys are crooks			0
they are crooks according to the @entity162			0
not just me , ' " @entity148 said			0
more than 30 states -- including @entity164 , the nation 's top tobacco producer -- have passed full or partial bans on smoking in public places			1
in @entity164 , such a move would have been unheard of just several years ago , with sen. @entity171 in power			0
@entity173 gov. @entity173 of @entity174 --- a former tobacco lobbyist -- also recently approved a 277 percent hike on his state 's cigarette tax			0
under the @entity36 regulation , warning labels on packages soon will show pictures of the harmful effects of tobacco			0
as public opinion increasingly sides with the public health community , the tobacco lobby has been losing some of its support in the nation 's capital			1
the @entity191 administration was widely considered a friend of the tobacco industry			1
some of @entity191 's top staffers had backgrounds in tobacco , including senior adviser @entity197 , who once worked with @entity198			0
@entity1 has since lost some of its strongest advocates , including @entity171 , who died last summer			1
now , democrats hold both chambers of @entity54 and the @entity203			1
president @entity204 was a co-sponsor of the @entity36 regulation legislation when he was in the @entity207 , and his administration has demonstrated a commitment to tobacco control			0
many of today 's top leaders in @entity54 are also strong tobacco - control advocates			1
but despite the restrictions , there are more than 40 million smokers in the @entity16 -- and that 's still a viable industry			0
despite what it sees as setbacks from the @entity36 bill , @entity93 plans to " energetically continue to compete " for adult smokers , said @entity224 , vice president of communications for @entity225 and @entity198 , which had a role in crafting the @entity36 legislation , said there could be more competition for new manufacturers as a market emerges for " reduced - harm products			0
" tobacco companies have shown their influence is still felt , even this year			0
even though 79 senators voted for final passage of the @entity36 legislation , it took two months and three cloture votes to get it off the @entity207 floor			0
( freshman sen. @entity242 of @entity164 was the only @entity243 to vote against it			0
) as the tobacco industry tries to adapt to the changing market , @entity8 predicts it will look to where it can operate in an unregulated environment			1
" the future of this industry has been to move its product offshore and to aggressively attempt to open new markets to cigarettes and to really play out what it did in the @entity16 in the 20th century , now in countries in the developing world , " he said , noting that the biggest profits for tobacco as a global industry are " not likely to be in more affluent and highly regulated economies			2
" although the industry has been fractured in the @entity16 , @entity8 said he anticipates a long road ahead for the public health community			2
" i think these are victories in what have been called the tobacco wars , but the tobacco wars are anything but over , " he said .			1

tobacco industry once known for big spending on campaigns , effective lobbyists
as public opinion has turned on @entity1 , courts and @entity54 has too
despite moves against industry , " tobacco wars are anything but over , " author says
