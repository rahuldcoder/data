take a larger than life governor who may have designs on the @entity3 and a battleground state crucial in presidential politics , and guess what : 2013 might not be as quiet a political year as you thought			0
@entity8 and @entity9 are the only two states to hold gubernatorial contests in the year after a presidential election , and in both states , the campaign clocks are already ticking			1
" @entity9 and @entity8 are going to get a lot of attention because they are the only games in town in 2013 , " said @entity15 , deputy editor of the non-partisan @entity16			1
" the eyes of the world are on these two races , " agrees @entity21 , executive director of the @entity22 , who adds that " next year in @entity9 and @entity8 we 're going to play a significant part			1
" and the two races will be a hot topic as the @entity29 begins two days of meetings on wednesday in @entity31			2
analysis : it 's never too early to talk about 2016 in the wake of big @entity22 victories in the 2008 election , the @entity34 swept both races in the @entity39 and the @entity8 from @entity40			1
" in 2009 , the victories in @entity9 and @entity8 kick - started the @entity34 comeback in the 2010 midterm elections , " said @entity29 communications director @entity41 , who suggested that @entity29 victories in 2013 could have a similar impact on the 2014 midterms			1
he added that " it 's a great opportunity for the @entity34 to get its focus back on results oriented leadership			0
" while both races will get tons of attention , @entity8 may steal more of the spotlight thanks to its tough - talking @entity29 governor , @entity56 , who may also , down the road , be a contender for the 2016 @entity34 presidential nomination			1
@entity56 says his decision on running for re-election has been slowed by @entity63 's devastation to parts of his state			2
the governor has spent the past two weeks dealing almost exclusively with the powerful storm and its aftermath			0
at a news conference earlier this week , he offered no timetable for a decision , but did say he 'll soon give the 2013 race some serious consideration			0
@entity56 : @entity74 ' did n't get enough votes ' while @entity56 has yet to make any announcement , some @entity34 strategists are convinced the first - term governor , who 's very popular among @entity34 and who served as a key surrogate for @entity74 's presidential campaign and was seriously considered as @entity74 's running mate , will run for re-election			1
" the governor 's race in @entity8 is ultimately going to be decided on the strength of governor @entity56 's record , " @entity41 said			1
" he 's shown a tremendous ability to get big things done in a bipartisan fashion , including education reform , pension reform , and most recently with his leadership after @entity63			0
what voters want in their governor is a leader who can get things done , and there 's no doubt that governor @entity56 has gotten a lot done in his first term as governor			1
" @entity40 see it a different way , and highlight the state 's 9.8 % unemployment rate			0
" on the economic front i think he 's failed to deliver again and again and again			0
he 's got a huge raft of negatives against him that is sometimes hidden by the rhetoric and theater and side show that is governor @entity56 , " said @entity21 , who added that " @entity8 is a state that 's brought down big characters before			1
" the big question in @entity8 is which @entity117 will take on @entity56			1
much speculation centers on @entity120 mayor @entity119 , a rising star in the @entity40			0
others considering bids are state sen. @entity123 , who served as governor for 14 months following the november 2004 resignation of then - gov. @entity126 , state sen. @entity127 and assembly member @entity128			2
a @entity130 poll conducted last month indicated that 56 % of @entity8 registered voters approved of how @entity56 was handling his duties , and by a 52 % -40 % margin thought he deserved re-election next year			1
in hypothetical matchups , @entity56 had a 46 % -42 % edge over @entity119 and a 47 % -41 % advantage over @entity140 , with double - digit leads over @entity127 and @entity128			2
@entity34 expands majority in governors ' mansions , @entity146 projects in @entity9 , where governors can not run for consecutive terms , the question right now is whether @entity150 wants his old job back			1
a new poll suggests if he does , it may be his for the taking			0
a @entity130 survey released wednesday indicated the first term @entity157 senator would be the favorite candidate as the 2013 @entity9 gubernatorial campaign gets under way			1
@entity150 , who was elected @entity9 governor in 2001 and to the @entity162 in 2008 , has said he 'll announce by @entity163 if he 'll stay in the @entity162 or make a bid for governor			1
according to the poll , @entity150 holds large leads over the two leading @entity29 candidates in hypothetical showdowns			2
among registered @entity9 voters , @entity150 leads lt. gov. @entity171 , 53 % -33 % , and tops attorney general @entity172 , 52 % -34 %			1
" if senator @entity150 decides to run , he begins the campaign as the prohibitive favorite , " says @entity173 , assistant director of the @entity174			2
" he is much better known and much better liked than either of the @entity29 aspirants and his job approval rating - 60 % - is the highest of any statewide elected official			1
" @entity181 : @entity34 must be more inclusive but the general consensus among some @entity22 strategists is that @entity150 will keep his current job			2
@entity185 , the former @entity186 chairman and former top adviser to @entity171 and @entity188 , announced last thursday that he 'll make a second run for @entity9 governor			2
@entity185 came in second to state sen. @entity191 in a three - candidate battle for the 2009 @entity22 nomination			0
deeds ended up losing by a landslide in the general election to then - @entity29 attorney general @entity181			0
if @entity150 stays in the @entity162 and @entity185 is the @entity22 nominee for governor , the poll indicates the race is much closer , with @entity185 at 38 % and @entity171 at 36 % , and @entity185 at 41 % and @entity172 at 37 %			2
the battle for the @entity34 nomination could get very interesting , with @entity172 , a conservative tea party favorite , squaring off against @entity171 , who is more moderate than his rival			0
@entity171 , the two - term lieutenant governor , has @entity181 's endorsement			0
but the nomination will be decided next year at a state party convention , often dominated by more conservative activists , which favors @entity172 , rather than a primary , which could favor @entity171			0
while preparing for either outcome , the @entity22 relishes facing off against @entity172 , with @entity21 saying he 's " the wrong man at the wrong time			0
" @entity9 has become a battleground state in the past two presidential cycles , with president @entity216 carrying the state for a second straight election last week			0
and the @entity40 held control of the state 's open @entity162 seat in last week 's elections			0
but the @entity29 sees some positives going into next year 's contest			0
" i think the encouraging thing about @entity9 is the @entity29 brand at the state level and particularly the gubernatorial level is extremely strong thanks to the leadership of governor @entity181 and no matter who our nominee is , they 're going to have a proven ability of getting elected statewide , " @entity41 said .			1

two gubernatorial contests in @entity8 and @entity9 will receive a lot of attention
in 2008 , the governors races foretold the 2010 @entity29 midterm sweep
polls show @entity8 gov. @entity56 with a 56 % approval rating
@entity157 sen. @entity150 may run for his old job as governor of @entity9
