@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 is scheduled to visit the demilitarized zone that splits the @entity5 in two for the first time on sunday			1
his planned visit to the heavily fortified border is part of a three - day trip to @entity1 to participate in a summit meeting about nuclear security in @entity0			1
top officials from 54 countries including @entity15 and @entity16 will attend the summit meeting next week , but its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by @entity20 's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket - powered satellite launch in april			1
@entity1 has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear - armed missile , while the @entity25 has warned the move would jeopardize a food - aid agreement reached with @entity28 in early march			1
@entity20 says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch			0
against that tense backdrop , @entity3 will visit the demilitarized zone and meet with some of the 28,500 @entity25 troops stationed in @entity1 , two of his top national security advisers said tuesday during a conference call			1
the " fundamental message " of the visit is " underscoring the president 's support for the @entity25 troops who are serving on the @entity5 , and our support for the @entity1 , our very close and strong treaty ally , " said @entity41 , deputy national security adviser , using @entity1 's official name			2
although @entity3 himself has not been to the demilitarized zone during his two previous trips to @entity1 as president , secretary of state @entity50 paid a visit to the area in 2010			1
and @entity3 's predecessor , @entity57 , used binoculars to peer into @entity20 from a sandbagged bunker on the southern side of the border in 2002			0
the date of @entity3 's visit " is virtually two years to the day " since the sinking of the @entity1 warship , the @entity62 , which left 46 @entity64 sailors dead , said @entity65 , director for @entity66 , @entity1 , and @entity20 at the @entity67			2
@entity1 says a @entity20 torpedo attack was to blame for the ship 's sinking			0
the @entity75 has denied the accusation			0
in a dramatic reminder of the @entity25 military presence in @entity1 , an @entity25 @entity78 fighter jet crashed wednesday near @entity82 airbase on the western coast of @entity1			2
the jet 's pilot safely ejected before the crash , and no casualties were reported , said maj. @entity88 , public affairs officer of the 7th @entity89			0
@entity2 's @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 contributed to this report .			0
