-- residents of coastal areas in @entity3 and @entity4 are preparing for the arrival of a large storm that is rumbling toward them across the @entity8 , with a @entity10 agency warning that more than 8 million people could be in danger			1
the storm , @entity13 , is forecast to make landfall late thursday or early friday in southeastern @entity3 , near the city of @entity16			1
it is likely to bring strong wind and heavy rain to the surrounding region			0
on @entity4 's western coast , there are concerns about the safety of tens of thousands of @entity25 who are living in makeshift camps in low - lying areas after their homes were destroyed in sectarian violence last year			1
" @entity34 could be life threatening for millions of people in @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity37 , " @entity31 , the @entity10 's top official for humanitarian affairs , said in a statement tuesday			1
the number of people the storm will affect depends on the exact path it plows across the region and its strength when it reaches land			1
aid agencies and local authorities are scrambling to make sure residents are as prepared as possible , taking measures that include moving people at risk to higher ground and putting emergency supplies in position			2
" there is a flurry of activity going on both in @entity3 and in @entity4 ahead of the storm , " @entity55 of the @entity56 and @entity56 said wednesday			1
" it 's really a race against time in many ways			0
" the latest prediction suggests @entity34 will bring wind gusts of 85 to 90 kilometers per hour ( 53 to 56 mph ) to the @entity3 coast , @entity65 meteorologist @entity64 said			1
that puts it at the level of a tropical storm , he said , weaker than the 120 - kilometer - per - hour gusts of a hurricane			1
" this will be a rain event for most in the area , " @entity64 said			0
" if you are in a concrete building , you will be fine outside of localized very heavy flooding			0
" the floods could cause problems in low - lying areas , particularly the flimsy camps in @entity4 's @entity86			1
as the storm approaches , @entity4 authorities and relief agencies have begun working to relocate tens of thousands of the camps ' inhabitants			1
most of them are @entity94 , a stateless @entity25 minority who suffered during decades of military rule in @entity4			1
sectarian violence erupted in @entity86 last year between @entity98 and @entity25 , resulting in the deaths of scores of people , the majority of them @entity94			2
since then , more than 100,000 @entity25 have been forced to live in camps			2
in a report last month , the advocacy group @entity104 accused @entity4 authorities of involvement in a @entity109 campaign of " ethnic cleansing " against the @entity94 in @entity86			2
the @entity4 government dismissed the report as " one - sided			2
" the efforts to relocate some of the displaced @entity94 living in the camps appear to have been hindered by distrust of the security forces involved			0
some of those in the camps " are reluctant to relocate , and some communities have refused to use military vehicles or to shelter in military barracks , " the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) said in an update on the situation tuesday			0
alternative relocation sites are being sought , it said			0
on monday night , a boat ferrying people from one camp in @entity86 to safer areas hit rocks and capsized , the @entity117 said , citing the government			0
fifty - eight people are believed to still be missing from the accident			0
some survived , and an unspecified number died , the agency said			0
@entity3 authorities appear to be well organized for the storm 's possible threat to the low - lying and densely populated nation			1
as many as 50,000 volunteers are giving out early warnings , providing advice , helping people relocate and preparing to give first aid and distribute relief items , @entity55 said			0
@entity3 has learned to take a cautious approach to storms after the catastrophic impact of @entity151 in 1970 that is estimated to have killed 400,000 people , according to the @entity117			2
@entity0 's @entity153 contributed to this report from @entity155 and @entity156 from @entity157 , @entity3 .			0
