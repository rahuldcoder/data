@entity0 -- the curious annual song contest that sees a continent united around its televisions for an evening of high - energy songs , spangled costumes and ill - advised drinking games -- is once more upon us			1
founded in 1956 , it was intended as a way to bring together once - warring nations through the innocent medium of pop music			0
it has n't necessarily ended the rivalries ( the voting - based results system is notoriously territorial ) , but for the hundreds of millions watching on tv , @entity0 is a well - rehearsed , almost comforting routine			1
it 's less comforting , however , for the competitors and fans dispatched to an unfamiliar city -- this year 's @entity21 will be held may 10 at the @entity22 in @entity23 -- to uphold or betray national honor with only leotard - clad backing dancers for company			1
@entity23 : 10 things to know before you go help is at hand , though			2
herewith our insiders ' guide to maximizing @entity36 joy , or minimizing sorrow , in the @entity39 capital			1
drinking and dancing @entity23 is compact for a major capital , with a shade over half a million inhabitants , but it 's increasingly famed for nightlife , especially in the @entity46 -- just like the similarly scenester - filled area of @entity48 -- near the central station			1
here the nightlife concentration is sufficiently dense to allow disgruntled central @entity52 crooners to stumble from bar to club			0
for those determined to dance , locals suggest @entity58 ( @entity59 18 ; +45 33 313 933 ) , or @entity60 ( @entity61 54 ; +45 33 325 050 )			0
slightly closer to the contest 's harbor - side venue is the dingy but welcoming @entity70 ( @entity71 18 ; + 45 32 577 092 ) in @entity72 , a possible home - from - home for this year 's face fur - fixated @entity67 entry , @entity69			1
the walls are covered in @entity75 iconography and the beer is dirt cheap			0
the more adventurous could venture to one of the city 's most defiantly hip nightclubs , sunday ( @entity80 16 ; +45 53 668 228 ) , which boasts an in - house team of @entity83 transgender dancers and a mission to -- their words -- " push the borders of wicked indecency			0
" eating enough about @entity89 , already			0
the seashore - foraging , micro-herb - arranging repeat winner of the best restaurant in the world crown is undeniably astounding			0
but the chances of getting a table are roughly the same as @entity98 's prospects of ever winning @entity0 ( this year 's entrant , @entity100 , was kicked out in the semi-finals , adding to half a century of failure )			1
perhaps off limits too are various offshoots such as @entity105 , run by a former @entity89 head chef , or @entity107 , where the specialty is braised lamb 's head with whipped brain and stuffed eyeballs -- which sounds almost as tricky to digest as @entity115 's saccharine @entity0 entry			1
@entity39 restaurant @entity89 named the world 's best a better bet is smorrebrod , the traditional @entity39 open sandwiches that are escaping their lunchtime roots and entering the world of fine dining			1
@entity124 and 10 more new @entity126 sandwich heroes many of the better known outlets tend to be booked up , but you can try @entity130 ( @entity131 72 ) off @entity132 in the city center , which does n't take reservations and attracts a fashionable crowd			0
for more basic fare still , there 's always @entity23 's many and famous hot dog stands			2
@entity139 ( @entity140 269 ) is a little ways outside the center , but locals make the trip for both the sausages and the trademark chili sauce , known as krudt -- the @entity39 word for gunpowder			0
same - sex marriage not for everyone , obviously , and arguably a little hard to arrange on a night out			1
nevertheless , this is one of the @entity0 - based attractions promoted by @entity23 officials			1
throughout the @entity0 weekend the city is encouraging any couples to tie the knot			0
ceremonies can be held on a specially arranged " wedding boat " cruising the harbor			0
the marriages are intended to mark both the 25th anniversary of same - sex civil partnerships in @entity39 -- the first country in the world to permit them -- and @entity0 's open - minded reputation			1
with its focus on flamboyant acts and tight sequined outfits , the contest has always had a decidedly camp air , a reputation sealed when @entity174 , an @entity175 transgender woman , won in 1998			0
her mantle has been passed this year to @entity179 's entrant , @entity180 , the bearded drag alter ego of singer @entity180			0
cycling something of a @entity39 cliche , perhaps -- the city has one of the highest rates of bike use in the world -- but stick with us , because @entity0 2014 needs all the environmental help it can get			1
most bike - friendly cities in the @entity126 this year 's event had proudly branded itself the greenest contest ever -- until newspapers discovered electricity for the venue itself is being provided by 26 very large , very smelly diesel generators			1
contestants can pedal serenely away from the fumes , and the humiliation of being beaten by @entity204 's @entity206 - lite entry , @entity207 , on @entity23 's famous network of segregated bike lanes			1
organizers are laying on fleets of bikes for @entity0 use , and the city is littered with rental shops			0
( @entity216 , @entity217 11 ; +45 32 12 50 50 and @entity218 5 ; +45 50 32 11 00 )			0
for those feeling particularly homesick -- or humiliated -- the city 's airport , only about six miles from the center , is connected by yet more of those ubiquitous bike lanes			0
the @entity224 while arguably the most iconic symbol of @entity23 , the bronze statue of @entity228 's famous fairy tale character is underwhelming in real life , standing little more than a meter tall			2
five places to find mermaids her harbor - side location , however , is restful -- the perfect place to sit and contemplate what might have been had the seams on the lead dancer 's costume held together a little longer			2
it 's a place to consider also that even if @entity23 's attractions are n't enough , things could have been much , much more sedate			2
the capital won its bid to host the event against a series of notably smaller @entity39 locations			2
among them was @entity248 , a city on @entity39 's @entity251 peninsula whose tourist information board lists " libraries " as among the chief attractions .			2

this year 's annual @entity0 song contest is being held in @entity23
the @entity39 capital is increasingly famed for its nightlife
@entity39 is *celebrating* the 25th anniversary of legal same - sex civil partnerships . it was first country to permit them
