always last to be picked for the team ? could n't catch a ball if your life depended on it ? got coordination skills that make you a laughing stock ? @entity7 playing @entity8 in @entity9 maybe you 've been picking the wrong sports : tennis , soccer , football and baseball do n't suit everyone 's talents			2

@entity19 , paper , scissors is a game most kids played in the school yard -- and it now has its own league			1
in 2007 , the @entity35 was broadcast on television , with a top prize of $ 50,000			1
the main skill is mental , say players , comparing it to poker where the ability to " read " your opponent and anticipate his next move is highly prized			0
but @entity45 , co-commissioner of the @entity46 , has said it 's also important to be fit : " there are different styles of play			2
a lot of power goes into it			0
the mental drain of it has a toll on the body			0
" there are also injuries : " people dislocate shoulders or sprain wrists			0
" extreme ironing web site extremeironing.com calls it " the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt			2
" extreme @entity72 takes the loathsome domestic task of ironing into " extreme " locations : cliff tops , rock faces , up trees , in crowed public places and underwater			2

@entity116 this is a sport that requires a special sort of dexterity : your lips and breath			1
sorting out the champions from the amateurs , the @entity124 held in @entity127 has categories in classical and popular tune whistling , either accompanied or solo			0
but there are strict rules : " medleys combining more than one song will not be allowed			1
time should be as brief as possible and not longer than six minutes for classical selections , or four minutes for popular selections , or five minutes for hand whistling , " state the guidelines			0
winners are judged on performance , originality , " embellishments " and the quality of whistling			0
the good thing about this sport is that you can practices whilst doing other tasks : whistle while you walk , while you work , while you @entity153 ... @entity154 oh golly -- this is one weird sport we wo n't be trying			1
@entity154 is a @entity158 sport involving horses , animal carcasses and whips			1
@entity154 has been likened to polo , but instead of a ball , the headless carcass of an animal -- usually a headless goat or calf -- is used			1
the aim is to grab it off the ground while riding and then get it clear of the other players and pitch it across a goal line or into a vat			0
play can last for several days			2
it 's important during the game that the carcass does n't disintegrate , so the calf is normally beheaded , disemboweled , has its limbs cut off at the knees and is soaked in cold water for 24 hours before play to toughen it			1
occasionally , sand is packed into the carcass to give it extra weight			2
special horses are trained for the event so they do n't trample the riders , should they be thrown , and gallop at speed towards the goal line when the rider collects the carcass			0

@entity89 -- on cliffs , up trees and underwater -- has proved a @entity108 hit
@entity116 has strict rules , demands dexterity of lips and breath
@entity154 sees horsemen play polo - type game with carcass instead of ball
