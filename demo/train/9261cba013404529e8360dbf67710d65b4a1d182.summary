-- on wednesday , @entity2 gov. @entity1 rightly vetoed the state bill that would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay people on religious grounds			1
i had a bet with a friend that she would n't sign it -- and wonder why it took her so long			1
she wo n't take a hit to the pocketbook -- she 's too savvy for that			1
in the days leading up to this , i put a sign in the window of my pizzeria that said : " we reserve the right to refuse service to @entity2 legislators			1
" the reaction was vastly and overwhelmingly positive , with only a few people telling me they would n't ever eat at my restaurant again			2
mainly , we have received many , many messages of support ; phone calls , e-mails and texts , from people who live in @entity33 , across the state and even from outside the @entity35			2
the sign is part of a tradition we have			1
when i moved into the supposedly cursed restaurant space on @entity40 in @entity33 , @entity2 , 15 years ago , i found a box of letters -- the kind you put on a marquee sign out front			1
by the end of the day , i had a message on the sign			1
we 've been changing it every day since			2
i am often told people plan their routes to see what we have to say each day -- even if just for a chuckle			2
sometimes we put up song lyrics , or a snarky comment about someone in the news , such as @entity58			0
one day we put up " @entity59			0
" some people get their knickers in a twist about our messages , but we do it for ourselves as much as anything			0
then i learned that the state @entity66 once again passed an appalling bill that attempted to save me from my fellow @entity69			1
i thought , " oh no , not again			0
" if anything seemed ripe for parody , this was it			0
i instantly typed a comment on my @entity76 page , saying that the busybodies in the capital of @entity79 were not allowed to come in and sit at my table			0
minutes later , one of my followers supplied the sign that so eloquently expressed my viewpoint			2
i laminated it , and by that afternoon it was on my doors			0
since then , a lot of similar signs showed up in the windows of @entity33 businesses saying " we reserve the right to serve anybody			1
" @entity33 is a little more liberal than @entity95 and @entity79 : we 're a university town			0
people here just do n't care about things like that			0
at restaurants , we just serve you and smile			2
@entity2 businesses have already been hurt by reactionary positions , such as our anti-immigration laws			1
the state has been boycotted before -- and it hurts because we depend a lot on tourism			0
freedom or oppression ? that 's the question for @entity2 's @entity111 as well as hurting small businesses , plenty of large companies have reconsidered locating here , saying , " we 'll take our dollars elsewhere			1
" one business owner , reacting to this legislation , even told me : " @entity2 is the @entity120 " -- where they put gay people in jail			1
we have so much poverty , terrible roads , some unbelievably bad schools -- and this bill is what our legislators wasted their time on			1
many @entity35 think they know what living on the border is like			0
but @entity33 was long a part of @entity134 until the @entity135 in 1853			2
many of our old @entity138 , @entity134 , @entity139 and @entity140 families here have histories that go back long before @entity2 was even a territory of the @entity35			1
and as in much of the @entity143 , a live - and - let - live philosophy pervades our lives here in a real and tangible way			0
this century will be one of expanding civil rights for individuals			0
but @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity138 schools -- where they tried to make @entity154 children abandon their identities -- and @entity157 immigration laws are not so far in the past that we can safely ignore them			1
they were wrong , just like discrimination against gay people is wrong			0
this legislation was ostensibly trying to protect religious freedom			0
a lot of @entity167 groups feel like they 're being persecuted by our culture , and that is really what underlies this bill			2
but if they feel like they 're being persecuted , they should try being gay for a little while			0
i can not condone discrimination against one group of people			0
regardless of the kind intentions of the lawmakers to the north of @entity33 that were trying to make sure i have freedom of religion , i already have it			0
this bill was gratuitous as well as ridiculous			2
i can already refuse service to anyone -- and that includes any one of those several dozen @entity69 who are n't representing my views in @entity79			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

@entity2 gov. @entity1 vetoed bill that would give businesses right to refuse to serve gays
@entity197 's pizzeria sign : " we reserve the right to refuse service to @entity2 legislators "
he says not long ago , *blacks* , @entity138 and @entity139 were discriminated against in @entity2
@entity212 was sure @entity1 would veto ; it would hurt @entity2 businesses if it became law
