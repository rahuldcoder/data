-- two years ago , the signs were clear			0
my mother , with @entity4 's , heart failure , and kidney failure , was not going to live long			0
my brothers and i took time off work for medical appointments and hospice care			2
i worried about her comfort , about how my dad would cope and how the grandkids would feel			0
but i never had to worry about one thing : my job			0
i knew i could take family leave without being fired			1
my workplace has generous leave policies			2
and thanks to the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) -- enacted 20 years ago this week -- i had a legal right to job - protected leave			1
the @entity21 has been used more than 100 million times by women and men to care for parents , children and spouses with serious illnesses , to bond with new children and to manage their own serious health conditions			2
but millions of other workers are not so lucky			0
the @entity21 , which grants job protection for up to three months of leave , applies only to enterprises with 50 or more employees			1
eligibility requirements exclude many workers			0
in other words , close to half of the @entity42 workforce has no @entity21 protection			2
even among eligible workers , many can not afford to take family or medical leave			1
this law guarantees only unpaid leave			2
only about 12 % of the work force has access to paid family leave through employers			1
as a result , many workers have to choose between a paycheck and their family 's well being			2
beyond that , work - family policies have not kept up with the dramatic changes that the @entity42 work force has experienced over the past few decades , particularly with regard to women			0
the labor force participation rate for mothers of young children stood at 70.6 % in 2011 , compared with 47 % in 1975			0
men , though still doing less family caregiving than women , are taking greater responsibility for it than before			2
the proportion of men caring for relatives with @entity4 's or dementia , for example , doubled -- from 19 % to 40 % -- from 1996 to 2009			0
as the @entity21 turns 20 , it is time to bring it up to date for today 's work force			1
this includes expanding coverage and establishing family and medical leave insurance to make leave affordable			1
studies from other countries have found that paid family and medical leave programs boost productivity			1
one study of 19 developed countries found that paid parental leave had a significantly greater positive effect on productivity than unpaid leave			1
the study also said that instituting paid leave in countries ( such as the @entity42 ) without it could increase productivity			1
paid leave helps retain employees and avoid turnover costs			1
one study found that 94 % of leave - takers who received full pay returned to the same employer , compared with 76 % of those with no pay			2
paid family leave is associated with better health and lower health care costs			1
a 2010 study found that the @entity42 could prevent nearly 900 infant deaths and save $ 13 billion per year if 90 % of mothers breastfed exclusively for six months			0
but only 47 % of @entity42 babies are breastfed at all at 6 months , and only 16 percent exclusively			0
paid family leave has been shown to dramatically increase breastfeeding , such as in @entity115 , where the introduction of paid family leave doubled the median duration of breastfeeding for new mothers who used it			1
the bottom line is that paid family and medical leave pays off			2
it increases productivity , reduces turnover costs , and results in health care savings			0
the only two states with family leave insurance programs -- @entity115 and @entity132 -- are showing positive outcomes , and proving that such insurance programs are affordable			1
the vast majority of @entity115 businesses included in a 2011 survey said that the program had a positive effect or no noticeable effect on productivity , profitability , turnover , and employee morale			0
both @entity132 and @entity115 finance their programs exclusively through small payroll deductions for workers ( with no employer contribution ) , and offer six weeks of partially paid leave			1
in @entity132 , workers pay .001 % of the taxable wage base ( maxing out at $ 30.90 for 2013 ) , and can get up to $ 584 per week during leave			1
the days before my mother 's death were peaceful and positive			0
i had the privilege of being with my family for this graceful end , and peace of mind from knowing my job was secure			0
enhancing @entity42 law to give all workers this kind of security would benefit not just workers , but businesses and the economy as a whole			0
the opinions expressed by this commentary are solely those of @entity173			0

@entity21 let @entity173 keep job while taking time off to care for mom
act is 20 years old this week , a boon , but has **n't** kept up with changing workplace she says
she says about 50 % workers eligible for @entity21 . and many ca **n't** afford to take unpaid time off
@entity173 : family leave insurance , for paid leave , has been shown to increase productivity
