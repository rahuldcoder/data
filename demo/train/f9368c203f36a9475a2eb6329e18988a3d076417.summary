-- part of an art collection confiscated because it may contain pieces looted by the @entity8 is being returned to its owner , prosecutors in the @entity3 town of @entity4 said wednesday			1
prosecutors said they had returned the seized collection to @entity12 , who inherited the almost priceless artworks from his father , in light of new evidence			1
their statement came two days after news of a deal between @entity12 , @entity21 's cultural authorities and the @entity22 under which he agreed to allow research into the origins of suspected cases of looted or so - called " degenerate " art. under the deal , works owned by @entity12 which are not under suspicion can be returned to him			1
those suspected of being stolen will be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original @entity32 owners or their descendants if a claim is proven			2
works which have not been investigated by the @entity37 will be returned to @entity12 , it says			2
it 's not clear how many pieces may be the subject of claims from those who believe they were looted decades ago			0
but a statement on @entity12 's website says that " according to current information at most 3 % of the 1,280 confiscated works " could be involved			2
that would work out to about 38 paintings			0
@entity12 's spokesman , @entity50 , said monday that there was a second claimant for a @entity54 painting found in his hoard , " @entity56 " or " seated woman			2
" @entity12 's lawyer has said the claim must be properly examined before the painting can be returned			0
however , this does n't change @entity12 's intention to return pictures to their rightful owners if a claim is proven , @entity50 said			1
among the staggering haul found in @entity12 's @entity66 , @entity67 , apartment in early 2012 were paintings by @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
@entity12 , 81 , says he never suspected that the collection he inherited from his father might include stolen artworks			1
thousands of pieces of art condemned as " degenerate " by the @entity8 were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s			0
other works were stolen from @entity32 families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country			0
@entity12 's father , @entity92 , who was part @entity32 , survived the war as one of only four " degenerate art " dealers permitted by @entity96			2
prosecutors cite new evidence , objections it was last may when experts revealed that the artworks -- many long feared lost or destroyed , and some which had never been recorded -- had been discovered in @entity12 's apartment in the @entity109 area of @entity66			1
the vast collection , which experts have said has " a value so high it can not be estimated , " was recovered by @entity3 tax authorities in connection with an inquiry into tax evasion in february and march 2012			1
in its statement , wednesday , the prosecutor 's office defended its decision to seize the cache , now known as the @entity109 art trove , on the grounds it might contain stolen art. " at the time of the confiscation of the entire collection , the @entity4 prosecution was entirely convinced of the rightfulness of the measure , " it said			1
but , it said , the new evidence and the representations of @entity12 's defense lawyers have led the office " to assess the legal situation anew			0
" the investigation is not yet concluded , however , the prosecution said			0
the defense has applied to view more files and has yet to make its position public , it added			0
' fair solutions ' @entity12 told @entity3 magazine @entity144 last november that he longed for the paintings he inherited to be returned to him -- and that he regarded them as his only friends			1
the reclusive retiree also defended his father 's wartime dealings , saying " maybe he was offered something privately , but he would not have taken it			0
it would not have been good for him			0
" his father , by all accounts a savvy dealer , removed the huge collection from his house in @entity161 during the devastating bombing in the final days of @entity163 , and moved it to what later became @entity21			0
a statement on @entity12 's website states that he " was at all times convinced that he had inherited a collection from his father that predominantly consisted of so - called degenerate art from former @entity174 property in public collections and museums , " and that he was unaware it " includes a few works that today can be qualified as looted art. " now , it says , he is " is prepared to review and arrive at fair solutions together with the claimants for those works that are suspected of being looted art in such instances where qualified , documented , and justified claims for their return are asserted by heirs of @entity32 of persecution and where morally compelling grounds exist			1
" @entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
