-- looking like a tourist can cost you money and pride			1
looking like a local can open you up to even greater harassment			2
read our survivor 's guide , split the difference and come away with your upper lip intact			2
getting around travel around the @entity12 is relatively simple			1
yes , they drive on the left , but do n't be daunted			0
most roads are so narrow that it does n't make any difference which side you 're on			0
be prepared when driving distances of more than 20 miles			0
these can be epic undertakings on @entity12 's congested highways , but the misery of gridlocked traffic will be more than compensated for by road signs pointing to places with names like @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity12 has an extensive and efficient rail network , which only ever grinds to a halt when the weather turns hot , cold , wet or dry			1
tickets are expensive but you can find cheap fares by booking eight or nine years in advance of travel			0
try : the @entity40 sleeper train from @entity41 to @entity42 then a drive or hike around the spectacular @entity45			0
more : 10 of @entity41 's oldest , greatest pubs 2			0
climate there are warm days in the @entity12 , but you know you 're in a damp country when the merest hint of sunshine is front page news			1
@entity12 has four seasons , and while the transitions between them can be pleasant , each is typically as wet , gray and cold as the last			1
all are considered by @entity60 to be " ice cream weather			1
" whatever the climate throws at you , be prepared for endless conversations about it			1
these need n't be dull since , like @entity67 with snow , @entity60 have a impressive lexicon for rain			0
if you hear the word " mizzle , " it probably means a light shower			0
or maybe a low quality @entity75 track			0
dazzling spring and fall displays , but enough hot houses to ward off the worst of the weather ( @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity41 ; +44 20 8332 5655 )			2
more : the world 's best city is ... 3			0
royalty do n't be duped by @entity87			0
@entity12 has come a long way since the days when ordinary folk were awestruck by aristocracy			1
this is a modern country where all are born equal and social rewards are based on merit			0
this is why few @entity12 people bothered turning up when a blue - blooded chap married his sweetheart in 2011			1
it 's why barely anyone noticed when she gave birth a couple of years later			0
and it 's also why no one batted an eyelid when his flame - haired brother got naked in @entity107			2
ok , none of that is true			0
@entity12 people are as in thrall to their royal family as you are			1
and they 're willing to sell you a @entity115 ' n ' @entity117 souvenir tea towel with matching oven mitts to prove it			2
sprawling royal residence west of @entity41 where @entity122 can occasionally be spotted in her natural habitat ( @entity120 , +44 20 7766 7304 )			0
more : photos : @entity125 's christening 4			0
history @entity12 has so many ancient attractions , it 's hard to know where to start			1
and if you do manage to visit all the sites of historical interest , archeologists will simply dig up the bones of another 15th - century king from under a parking lot , just to annoy you			2
but since some @entity60 are only aware of two key dates -- a @entity139 invasion in 1066 and an @entity141 soccer @entity143 victory 900 years later -- you do n't need to try too hard to catch up			2
try visiting the northern city of @entity146 , where you can wallow in 2,000 years of @entity12 history in one location			1
or @entity150 , where you can do the same and also wallow in a nice thermal bath ( @entity153 , @entity150 ; +44 844 888 0844 )			0
compelling and sometimes gruesome stroll down @entity12 's memory lane ( @entity154 , @entity146 ; +44 19 0468 7687 ) more : 5 travel relationship killers 5			1

vast lakes of insipid infusions are consumed on a daily basis			1
visitors will note the almost mandatory provision of a miniscule electric jug , or kettle , in every hotel room			0
it will take four hours to boil half a cup , but for many brits this is an essential lifeline			0
there is n't any crisis they believe ca n't be solved with a nice cup of tea , and perhaps a biscuit			2
when preparing tea , there are rituals to be observed			2
use boiling water and , if you must resort to tea bags , always add the milk last			2
failure to do so will result in such distress that it may take another cup of tea to calm everyone down again			2
try : for posh tea , try @entity192 ( 181 @entity191 , @entity41 ; +44 84 5602 5694 )			2
for normal , head to the @entity193 © ( 17 - 19 regency st. , @entity41 ; +44 20 7821 6596 )			2

regional dialects vary extensively in the space of a few miles , resulting in bafflement even among locals			0

something about the weather ( see climate above ) , or b )			2
@entity12 people love apologizing : they 're sorry to trouble you , sorry they ca n't be more helpful , sorry about the rain and sorry about invading your country in 1762 , or whenever it was			1
they also love apologizing when it 's not even their fault : they 're sorry that you bumped into them , sorry you knocked them to the floor and sorry that you are repeatedly thwacking them over the head and telling them to stop apologizing			0
be warned though , it 's contagious			0
@entity231 's second city is reputedly the @entity12 's politest			1
perhaps it 's the impenetrable accents			0
more : want better sex ? travel more 7			0
cuisine @entity12 's bland national diet has been revolutionized by @entity241 migrants whose spicy concoctions are now firm favorites sold on every high street			1
meanwhile , pubs that once nourished customers with despondent sandwiches are now studded with @entity249 stars			0
but do n't be fooled			0
they might pretend to love fine dining , but when on the hoof , many @entity60 still prefer to fill their faces with offal and saturated fat			0
few journeys are made within the @entity12 that are n't catered with sausage rolls , cornish pasties and scotch eggs			1
visitors troubled by the sight of greasy meat should also be warned of three words that will strike fear -- if not full - blown cardiovascular seizures -- into their hearts : full			1
try : offally good food : @entity269 ( @entity270 , @entity41 ; +44 20 7251 0848 )			0
@entity272 average : any branch of @entity275 bakery			0
television be sure to take time out from your travels to sample a few hours of @entity12 television , but seek not the polished period dramas that are easily exported to other countries			1
where @entity12 tv excels is in its celebration of the lives of ordinary , dare we say boring , citizens			1
the @entity12 's three most popular soaps focus not on the beautiful or the damned , but on normal folk engaged in humdrum tasks like buying cheese , arguing about pottery or tending to their farms			1
talking of farms , every spring since 2010 @entity12 television has dedicated numerous prime time hours to some of the best reality tv ever conceived : live coverage of the annual lambing season			1
keep up with that , @entity302 ! try : tour locations from the @entity12 's sheep - heavy " @entity308 " soap : dull plots , stunning scenery ( @entity307 ; +44 84 4247 1007 )			1

tedious road journeys are offset with *entertaining* place names like @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity312
prepare for endless conversations about weather -- probably identical whatever season it is
