-- if a fellow is going to spend 55 years working in the same place , he would be wise to count his blessings that the place is @entity6			1
" the first day i walked in , in 1958 , i was 17 years old , " said @entity7			1
" i took a job as a fill - in art assistant			2
" he never went on to college			0
he never took another job			0
his explanation for staying is so basic he can express it in a single sentence : " i decided to stick with @entity15			2
and , most of all , @entity6 , @entity19 it does n't exist , of course , which is probably what makes the town so perfect			0
nothing in real life could match it			0
@entity28 first appeared in a comic book in 1941 , and that idealized town in which he and his friends have always lived has never been identified by state			2
some readers assume it is in the @entity35 , but @entity7 -- the longest - serving employee of @entity37 , and now its editor - in - chief -- will go no further than to say that " it 's in a place that has four seasons			1
" the summer , autumn , winter and spring in the pages of the comic books have never been the same seasons that @entity7 has observed outside the windows of the @entity15 offices in @entity48 , @entity49 : " we have a four - month lead time			1
so the season an artist is drawing on a given day is not the same season we 're living in actual life			0
" but actual life is not the key to @entity15 's eternal appeal , which may have a lot to do with what attracted @entity7 to the character , and the company , in the first place			1
he grew up in @entity62 , an only child until he was 16 : " my father worked in a fish market			0
he 'd leave the house at 4:30 or 5 o'clock in the morning , he would clean fish and sell fish all day , and he would come home tired with fish scales and sawdust on his shoes			0
i would clean his shoes			0
he worked so hard for his money			0
he never took me fishing			0
" @entity28 ' world , mythical though it was , had to have looked pretty swell next to that			2
when @entity7 , with @entity77 in the @entity78 , showed up for that fill - in job in the art department , his own comic - book tastes had tended toward " @entity82			1
" but he soon became enchanted with the gentle simplicity of the problems @entity15 faced : " he 's this klutzy , well - meaning kid who breaks things by mistake in @entity17 's house , or who cooks a beautiful breakfast to bring upstairs to his mother on @entity92 , but leaves behind a mess in the kitchen			1
" @entity7 's real life may or may not be any more irritation - free than anyone else 's -- on the day we spoke he was battling a nagging cough that would n't let go -- but there is something to be said for being able , for all these years , to lose himself , professionally , in a comic - book world where matters are ever placid , ever sunny			1
he has even been able to derive inspiration from the characters who live on those pages ; @entity15 takes solace in having a close buddy , @entity108 , " who he can talk to and tell him anything			2
" @entity7 said he has come to realize that his own @entity108 , his port in a storm , " lives in @entity112			2
i 've known him for 65 years , since we were kids			2
he was my best man -- twice			0
" ten presidents have succeeded @entity77 during @entity7 's years with @entity15 , and the country has changed in myriad ways			1
some of those changes have been reflected in the storylines of the comics -- racial and ethnic diversity in @entity6 , the introduction of a popular gay character -- and others have manifested themselves in the delivery systems for those stories : the disappearance around the nation of mom - and - pop candy stores with comic - book racks ( although @entity133 's @entity132 remains a vibrant @entity15 landmark ) , the rise in digital readership and availability of @entity15 apps			1
the @entity15 comic books continue to publish with new stories , in various sizes and lengths ; no new @entity15 newspaper strips are being drawn , although reruns of the old ones are available digitally			1
yet what is constant in that make - believe town is more significant than what is altered , @entity7 said : " behind everything is the idea that @entity6 is a place that is welcoming to anyone			1
the goal has always been to be a place of comfort to our readers , especially for our youngest readers			0
" nothing terrible or violent happens in @entity6 : " you have to keep that out of our town			0
kids today go through metal detectors at their schools , there are police officers in the hallways , the drugs , the gangs			0
" by design , " @entity15 lives in a world the way we might like it to be			1
" @entity7 understands how elusive such a world is			1
when he switches on his computer at work , the ugliness of news headlines on the screen reminds him that none of us really lives in @entity6			0
even in the corporate offices of @entity37 there has been acrimony in recent years , with lawsuits and bitterness between two top officers			0
but in the editorial department , @entity7 's job is to keep his focus on pretend streets where nothing becomes much more complicated than " @entity15 getting a little bamboozled because he has made a date with two different girls on the same night , and he asks @entity108 , ' how did i get into this mess ? ' " after all this time , does @entity15 seem real to him -- even like a friend ? " he 's my best friend -- he 's paid me every week for 55 years			1
" does he think about @entity15 after he 's closed his office door for the night ? " constantly			2
i 've got a framed oil portrait of him in my den at home			0
" does @entity15 's perpetual smiling youth ever make him consider his own mortality ? " i know i 'm not going to be around forever			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 : @entity7 has stayed with the @entity15 comic for 55 years
@entity213 : @entity7 was enchanted with the gentle simplicity of the problems @entity15 faced
he says while the world is complex and ugly , the world of @entity221 - is appealing
@entity213 : @entity15 , with his perpetual smile , is like a best friend for @entity7
