@entity0 -- as international anger grows over reports of mass carnage at the hands of the @entity7 regime , a @entity9 draft resolution condemning @entity7 failed to be adopted saturday after veto - wielding members @entity10 and @entity11 voted against it			1
ambassadors from the other permanent members of the council -- the @entity17 , @entity18 , and the @entity19 -- said they were furious at @entity10 and @entity11 for failing to halt the worsening , bloody violence that has consumed the @entity22 nation			1
thirteen @entity9 members voted in favor of the resolution			0
the vote was a major diplomatic setback for countries hoping to send a unified message to embattled @entity7 president @entity30 , and also for opposition groups that look toward the @entity0 for support			1
" those that have blocked potentially the last effort to resolve this peacefully ... will have any future blood spill on their hands , " @entity17 ambassador @entity33 told @entity1			0
" the people of @entity7 have yet again been abandoned by this @entity9 and by the international community			2
" some @entity7 have cried out for international action to stop attacks on civilians , more so after opposition groups said at least 321 civilians were killed and hundreds wounded in the city of @entity50 in the past two days			2
the opposition @entity51 blamed government forces for the attack in @entity50 , calling it one of the most " horrific massacres " since the start of the @entity7 uprising			2
residential buildings and homes were " randomly and heavily bombed , " the group said			0
the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , a @entity7 opposition group , said 90 people had been killed in @entity7 on saturday , including 61 in @entity50 , 10 in @entity62 , and 19 in a @entity64 suburb			2
in a bid to pressure the government , the group called for a two - day civil strike to start on sunday			0
another opposition group , the @entity69 , reported that 48 people were killed across @entity7 on saturday , including six army defectors and 18 members of the @entity7 security forces			2
@entity1 can not independently confirm opposition or government reports from @entity7 because the government has restricted journalists ' access to the country			2
some residents accused the international community of sitting idle as bodies mount in the streets , and predicted worsening violence in the wake of the vote			1
" we 've been expected the @entity0 to help us ... and they just left us like this , " said an activist identified as @entity88			0
" now this regime is going to hit us harder			0
" @entity7 's @entity0 ambassador , @entity91 , said his country has been " targeted by some powers seeking to punish it			1
" @entity91 called the crisis " manufactured " and said there is a media campaign to make the @entity7 regime look bad			1
following the vote , @entity18 president @entity99 said that diplomatic efforts are ongoing			1
@entity18 , its @entity103 and @entity104 partners are in talks to create a " @entity106 for the @entity107 , " he said			2
in a strongly - worded statement before the vote , @entity17 president @entity108 said @entity7 president @entity30 has lost all legitimacy and that the international community " must work to protect the @entity7 people from this abhorrent brutality			1
" he pointed the finger directly at @entity30 and what he called his " killing machine			0
" on saturday , funerals were held in @entity50 and residents worked to free bodies trapped under the rubble , said resident @entity123			0
snipers remained perched throughout the city , he said , complicating efforts			0
" the blood of our children is not a game , " @entity123 said			0
@entity0 @entity131 ban ki - moon said the vote was a lost opportunity to halt the violence			0
the resolution would have demanded that @entity30 stop the killing and answer international calls aimed at finding a @entity7 - led solution to the crisis			1
@entity17 ambassador @entity140 said the @entity17 was " disgusted " at the veto by @entity10 and @entity11			0
referring to @entity10 , she said , " this intransigence is even more shameful when you consider that one of these members continues to deliver weapons to @entity30			1
" the @entity10 foreign minister has spoken in defense of @entity10 arm sales to @entity7 , saying they did not affect the regional balance of power			1
@entity10 , which counts @entity7 as a major weapons client , has made clear that it will not accept an arms embargo or economic sanctions			1
@entity10 foreign minister @entity156 is scheduled to visit @entity64 on tuesday to meet with @entity30 , according to his ministry			1
@entity19 ambassador @entity158 said the @entity19 was " appalled " at the veto			0
" those who blocked the council action today must ask themselves how many more deaths they will be prepared to tolerate , " @entity158 said			0
it effectively means @entity10 and @entity11 " support tyranny rather than the legitimate aspirations of the @entity7 people , " he said			1
@entity19 foreign secretary @entity170 said the resolution supported @entity173 efforts to resolve the crisis in @entity7			1
" it did not impose any sanctions , nor did it authorize military action , " @entity170 said			0
" there was nothing in the draft to warrant opposition			0
" @entity91 said such statements " fan the flames of escalation of the violence and bloodshed " and " betray the true hostile , genuine intentions against @entity7 , the people of @entity7 , and the government of @entity7			2
" all along , he said , " the tone of their statements was not diplomatic ... when they describe the government of @entity7 as a ' regime ' and addressed the president of the state of @entity7 with inappropriate language			1
" speaking after the vote , ambassadors from both @entity10 and @entity11 said they do support an end to the violence but felt the resolution did not address the crisis properly			1
@entity10 ambassador @entity206 said the text " did not adequately reflect the real state of affairs and sent an unbalanced signal " to the various sides in @entity7			1
he noted that the minister for foreign affairs will visit @entity64 to hold a meeting with @entity30 in three days			1
@entity11 ambassador @entity213 called on all parties in @entity7 to stop the violence and restore order as soon as possible			2
but he said the text would have served only to " complicate the issue " and would " prejudge the result of dialogue			0
" @entity11 and @entity10 vetoed another @entity9 resolution in october that would have called for an immediate halt to the crackdown , which @entity0 officials have said has resulted in an estimated 6,000 deaths since protests began nearly a year ago			0
the @entity60 estimates that at least 7,339 people have been killed			0
" since these two members last vetoed a resolution on @entity7 , an estimated 3,000 more civilians have been killed , " @entity140 said saturday			0
earlier saturday , @entity231 said it would expel the @entity7 ambassador from @entity233 in response to the killings in @entity50 , while @entity19 foreign secretary @entity170 and his @entity18 counterpart @entity237 condemned the violence			1
@entity108 noted the violence in @entity50 came as the @entity7 people were celebrating the birth of the @entity242 and marking 30 years since @entity30 's father oversaw a massacre in the city of @entity246			1
the resolution voted on saturday had dropped demands from an @entity173 plan for @entity7 to form a unity government and for @entity30 to delegate power to his deputy			2
@entity0 diplomats said the changes reflected a big concession to @entity10 , which had been reluctant to sign on to any plan that could be seen as a mandate for regime change in @entity64			0
reports of the violence in @entity50 led to protests breaking out at @entity7 embassies in @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 on friday and saturday			2
@entity1 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 , and journalist @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
