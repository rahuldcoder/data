it 's been 21 years , and @entity1 still eagerly leans against his passenger window to watch the landscape pass by as the train he commutes on every day roars over the @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the green hills and vibrant leaves just below the elevated track make the trestle one of the prettiest scenes on the 57 - year - old 's trip			0
for more than two decades , the senior business analyst has been traveling about 67 miles for work from his home in @entity6 to lower @entity17			0
his total commute time is 2½ hours each way			0
it may seem like a lengthy commute , but @entity1 says he prefers this mode of travel			1
" compared to a bus or a car , it 's much more spacious and comfortable , " he says			0
as soon as @entity1 boards , he can start work , or socialize with the friends he 's made on the train over the years , or even stretch out his legs and spend a few hours reading a novel			1
@entity1 is not the only one dedicated to passenger rail			1
there has been a 51 % increase in ridership from 2001 to 2013 on @entity38 rail lines alone , according to @entity39 , the president of @entity40			1
more business travelers , students and people from the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are turning to trains for their work and vacation travels			1
@entity50 , a spokesman for @entity38 , the national rail operator , says the longstanding rumors from the 1980s that passenger rail is dying have changed			1
in the past 10 to 15 years , rail travel has seen a significant rise in ridership			1
" @entity58 has seen a real renaissance in the last decade , " he says			0
" it 's been a great time to be here			0
people are turning to rail for inter-city travel			1
" from october 2012 to september 2013 , " @entity38 welcomed aboard nearly 31.6 million passengers , the largest annual total in its history , " according to its website			1
some rail stations are brimming at capacity , @entity50 says			1
for example , @entity72 in @entity7 sees 650,000 passengers a day buzzing through			1
the @entity75 , @entity38 's busiest railroad , has more than 2,200 trains operating on the @entity80 - @entity79 route each day			1
related : libraries are dying ? think again @entity50 attributes the shift toward train ridership to the increase in traffic throughout many metropolitan cities in the @entity46			1
" in the @entity44 , there 's congestion on the streets because of cars and buses and there 's even congestion at airports			1
" he says people in many of @entity99 's busiest cities are looking for alternative ways to travel more efficiently			1
for @entity1 , traveling via train not only reduces commuting stress , but it also allows him and his wife , @entity104 , to live in a more serene environment that is far away from the fast - paced city lifestyle			2
" we moved to @entity6 specifically because i could take a train to work			2
it allowed us to live more than 50 miles outside the city and still commute comfortably to work every day , " he says			0
rediscovering freedom in travel the portrayal of trains as an old - fashioned mode of transportation is n't a realistic reflection of the hundreds of thousands of people who use them daily , according to @entity39 , @entity40 's president			1
" the community that travels on trains travel for many reasons			1
one is just for nostalgia			0
but there are a lot of people who travel from @entity80 to @entity7 and you wo n't find a lot of those people traveling for nostalgia , " he says			2
" they are in suits and ties , where time is money , and they can work for 2½ hours			0
" one of those in a suit and tie was vice president @entity143 , who for decades traveled by train between @entity80 and his home in @entity146 , @entity147 , while he served on the @entity148			2
although a growing number of people are commuting daily by train like @entity143 once did , there are also those who prefer to ride trains for leisurely travel to see more of the landscape and to relax			1
@entity156 says he and his wife , @entity157 , are among those people			0
@entity156 says they 're restless souls always seeking a new adventure			0
recently , they moved to @entity162 to teach @entity163			0
but throughout their lives they have had an affinity for trains , riding the @entity168 in @entity169 and traveling via rail throughout @entity171 and @entity172			1
@entity156 , 55 , fondly remembers a train ride he took in @entity171 during spring 1981			2
he had just been honorably discharged from the @entity174 after serving out his enlistment			0
he was traveling by train from @entity177 , where he was stationed onboard the @entity178 , to @entity179			2
" i had a window seat and was allowing my mind to wander with the rhythm of the train			2
suddenly , a switch flipped inside my head and i realized that even though i 'd spent the last two years in @entity171 , i was seeing -- really seeing -- the country for the first time , " he says			2
related : see why travelers are craving vintage theme parks zooming past the newly planted rice fields , schoolchildren in uniform , and homes tucked away against hillsides , he was inspired to come back to explore the country			2
" i do n't think i would have had that experience , that sudden ' connected - ness ' with the country , had i been riding any other mode of transportation			0
there is something incredibly liberating and thought - inducing about being on a train , " he says			2
in fact , @entity156 went back to school to receive a degree in creative writing and headed back to @entity171 , where he lived for seven years , immersing himself in the country 's beauty and culture			2
@entity156 says the draw for him and his wife to travel by train is independence			1
" the true luxury is freedom , " he says			0
" there are no seat belts and for most of the journey you are free to walk around , or have a glass of this or that , or read , or go to the dining car for something to eat , or simply stare out the window and allow thoughts to wander			0
" that freedom is a rare commodity in today 's travel culture , @entity39 says			0
" we let airlines treat us really badly			0
whether you have to sleep curled up in a ball because you got bumped from your flight or they lost your luggage along the way , we roll with it			0
but we do n't let trains do that to us , " he says			0
@entity39 says because trains are not readily incorporated in aggregated discount travel sites like @entity243 and @entity244 , the average traveler does not realize trains are a transportation option that can be cheaper and more accommodating than taking a flight			1
" i think if people stop flying over our country and start seeing our country and how large it is and how beautiful it is , they 'll get it , " he says			0
" it 's hard to have a train ride across the country and leave that and not be a patriot			0
