but in the next attack , @entity6 were ahead as @entity13 played in @entity67 to score neatly			1
a @entity13 header was disallowed for a marginal offside decision and he shot into the side netting after another typical burst into the penalty area , but @entity4 were also a threat going forward in an open game			2
