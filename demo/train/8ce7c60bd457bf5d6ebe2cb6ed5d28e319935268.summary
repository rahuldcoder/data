-- many observers gazing upon the current bloodshed in the @entity3 have wondered aloud if we are seeing the disintegration of the nation - state boundaries established in the region nearly a century ago			1
but the crises in @entity9 and @entity10 have simply laid bare a phenomenon that has been under way for quite some time			1
what 's more , this process is now almost certainly irreversible , and will lead to a radically different @entity3 map than we have known			1
in the heady early days of the @entity18 , many people imagined that the @entity20 world might finally be entering a period of greater democratization , one that would inevitably lead -- so the thinking went -- to greater social unity			0
the " people 's revolution " in @entity33 was subverted , and the fledgling democracy movement in @entity28 was crushed with @entity30 military assistance			0
but more devastating than that is the ongoing fracturing of nations into their historical component parts			0
the world may be focused on the rifts in @entity9 between its @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 communities -- but the same " balkanization " has already occurred in @entity44 , which is now effectively split into three de facto states			1
almost surely next on the chopping block is @entity10			0
@entity10 's savage civil war has divided the nation into a patchwork of government and rebel - held zones , and there is now talk within @entity55 's embattled regime of slicing off the @entity57 - dominated western portions of @entity10 to create a more defendable mini-state			0

in order to keep the peace and hold together their fantastically diverse and far - flung realm , the @entity66 sultans devised a clever system known as the " millyet			0
" so long as they pledged ultimate allegiance to the sultan and paid their taxes , the empire 's various religious and ethnic communities were allowed to largely govern themselves			0
it was hardly a trouble - free arrangement , but this system of autonomy was probably what enabled the weak @entity66 , the proverbial " sick man of @entity85 , " to survive into the twentieth century			2
that all ended in 1914 , when the @entity66 joined forces with @entity88 and @entity89 in @entity90 to the rival empires of @entity92 and @entity93 , the @entity66 lands now became known as " the @entity95 , " the last great frontier for @entity85 control and economic exploitation			1
of course , @entity92 and @entity93 first had to win the war -- and well into 1915 , they displayed scant ability to do so			2
in desperation , the @entity102 forged a secret agreement with emir @entity105 , the ruler of the @entity107 region of western @entity108 , to raise an @entity20 revolt against the @entity66			1
in return , @entity105 and his rebels were promised independence for virtually the entire @entity20 world			0
read more : the terror group taking @entity9 by storm no sooner had @entity92 made the pact with @entity105 , however , than it surreptitiously entered into negotiations with @entity93			1
under the terms of the secret @entity121 , the future @entity20 independent nation was to be relegated to the wastelands of the @entity108 -- oil had n't been discovered there yet -- while @entity92 and @entity93 would take possession of most everything else			2
continuing in this vein , @entity92 also penned the @entity127 , encouraging @entity129 emigration into the @entity131 region of @entity10 , an initiative that would ultimately prove to be the catalyst for the creation of @entity135			0
this double - cross of the @entity20 was not fully revealed until the postwar @entity137 , then put to paper in the @entity139			0
despite the furious protestations of @entity20 nationalists , greater @entity10 was divided into four parts -- @entity131 , @entity143 , @entity144 and modern - day @entity10 -- with the @entity102 taking the first two , the @entity93 the latter			1
even more volatile , as events would soon prove , were @entity102 machinations in @entity9			1
in their first negotiations with emir @entity105 , the @entity102 had asked for " special administrative arrangements " in those southern regions of @entity151 where oil had been discovered			2
but by the war 's end , oil had also been discovered in the north and , with the promise of @entity20 independence long discarded , the @entity102 simply joined three of the @entity66 's semi-autonomous regions together and called it a country			1
through their blithe hubris , @entity102 and @entity93 imperialists had built themselves a volcano and then sat atop it			1
for the next three decades , they managed to weather the periodic eruptions of @entity20 rage by propping up pliant local leaders or rushing in troops to quell the inevitable revolts			0
but by the early 1950s , their sway in the region had collapsed along with their empires			0
into the vacuum stepped a generation of ardently nationalist military dictatorships that would eventually stretch from @entity44 all the way to @entity9			1
but how did this transmogrify into the chaos and dissolution we see in the region today ? i think the answer lies in a subtler , more psychological , legacy of the " order " that was imposed by the @entity85 powers a century ago			1
read more : how @entity9 crisis may redraw borders ever since that grand betrayal , the @entity20 world has tended to define itself more by what it is opposed to -- colonialism , @entity199 , @entity201 political and cultural imperialism -- than what it aspires to , and even if @entity20 leaders have capitalized on this culture of grievance to channel popular discontent away from their own misrule , it is a mindset that has become internalized			1
in twenty - five years of covering conflict zones around the world , i 've found that guerrillas or dissidents most everywhere can articulate what they are fighting for ; in the @entity3 , by contrast , it is almost always an articulation of what they are fighting against			2
one result , i believe , is that there 's little in the way of consensus going forward once the existing order of things -- artificially - imposed or otherwise -- has been swept aside			0
instead , a vacuum is created , and the " @entity234 " fills it by turning to those allegiances that predated the object of their rage : their faith , their clans , their tribes			0
while the result is less devastating in a place with a strong national identity like @entity33 -- there , the lack of consensus simply means the " people 's revolution " can be gradually smothered -- in an " artificial " nation like @entity9 , a centrifugal force takes over that , once given full power , is almost impossible to reverse			1
we are now at that point in @entity10			0
since none of its warring factions can be militarily defeated -- and the various regional powers backing their respective proxies will see to that -- the slaughter there will continue until the creation of de facto mini-nations			0
in @entity9 , @entity258 is already independent in all but name , and has no reason to give it name lest its chief protector , @entity262 , become alarmed			2
the only larger question is whether @entity264 -- the @entity42 terror group that has taken @entity9 by storm in recent weeks -- will manage to consolidate its current hold in the center of the country and join it to the great swath of eastern @entity10 it controls			2
perversely , there may soon come a time when both the @entity41 - dominated regime in @entity274 and the @entity57 - dominated one in @entity276 both decide such a terror - state might be the best way to be rid of their @entity42 enemies			0
surely the biggest surprise thus far has been the relative calm in @entity143 , a nation cut from whole cloth by the @entity85 powers after @entity90 despite concerns that it too will fall into the abyss , @entity285 might well be saved by the need for all its warring neighbors to have a " @entity292 " in the neighborhood			2
what might explode next ? here , the old map of the @entity3 actually offers some solace			2
we 're simply starting to run out of places that the @entity85 imperialists screwed up			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity301 .			0

@entity301 : conflicts in the @entity3 are disintegrating region 's @entity305 borders
@entity102 , @entity93 imperialists " built volcano in @entity3 and then sat atop it "
@entity312 may be worried about " @entity313 " of @entity9 , " but that 's already happened to @entity44 "
