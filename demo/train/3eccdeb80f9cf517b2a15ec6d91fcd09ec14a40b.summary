-- if @entity2 does fail in pursuit of ' @entity4 ' then at least it will always have ' the decimation '			1
on a night where the champion was dethroned in brutal fashion , @entity2 flexed its muscles and showed it is ready to end the long wait for a 10th @entity13 triumph			1
a stunning 4 - 0 success in @entity15 completed a 5 - 0 aggregate victory and paved the way for a final clash with either city rival @entity19 or former manager @entity20 and his @entity22 side			1
not since 2002 has @entity2 , @entity23 's most successful club , managed to acquire the continent 's top club prize			1
no team has ever retained the @entity28 title and @entity29 , so highly fancied once again this year , rarely looked like repeating its glorious triumph of last season			1
trailing 1 - 0 from the first leg in @entity2 , @entity29 endured a nightmare first half as @entity2 produced an astonishing performance to lead 3 - 0 at the interval			1
@entity36 scored twice in four minutes before @entity37 rounded off a fine counter attack to claim his 15th goal of this season 's competition -- a new @entity28 record			1
@entity37 added a fourth late on with a free - kick to cap a remarkable performance to make it 51 goals in 50 @entity28 career appearances			1
" it 's a fantastic result for us , " winger @entity48 told @entity49			0
" we 've been working hard , got our tactics right , played well and deserved the win			0
" we are happy to be in the final but still have one game to go			2
everybody put in 100 % -- no matter who it was , they put in a performance			0
" this is why i wanted to come to the biggest club in the world - to win trophies in massive games			1
" we still have n't won it yet , we have a difficult game in the final whoever it may be but i 'm looking forward to it			2
" @entity48 will remember this occasion for many a year to come -- but for most of those who were packed inside the @entity73 , this was a night to forget			2
this was a painful and merciless destruction of a @entity29 side which had looked unbeatable earlier in the season			0
while @entity2 played with the belief and purpose of champions , @entity29 appeared cumbersome , disjointed and a shadow of the side which had waltzed to last season 's title			1
but for all of @entity29 's deficiencies , it would be churlish to take away from the achievement of @entity89 's side			0
@entity29 coach @entity90 had spent the past few days instilling belief and confidence into his players			0
much of that had evaporated within the opening 20 minutes as @entity2 's pace and power tore through the home defense			1
labored and predictable in possession and embarrassingly open in midfield , @entity29 allowed @entity2 to use the likes of @entity37 and @entity48 at every opportunity			1
yet , for all the attacking talent at its disposal , it was through an old - fashioned set - piece routine which @entity2 forged ahead			1
@entity107 's corner parted the @entity29 defense and @entity36 rose highest to head an unstoppable effort past @entity110			0
shocked and stunned by conceding , the home team was then hit with a real knockout blow four minutes later			0
again it was @entity36 who found the net , producing a fine header to guide @entity118 's cross into the far corner			0
for @entity36 , this was sweet revenge			0
two years ago , the @entity122 international missed from the penalty spot as @entity2 was defeated on spot kicks by @entity29 in the last four			2
this time , it was he who was dancing with delight as @entity29 heads began to drop			0
dazed and downbeat , @entity29 looked beaten			0
real , defeated in its past three semifinal appearances , began to play with the style and swagger long associated with the club from the @entity133 capital			1
and with 11 minutes of the first half remaining , it produced a breathtaking move to claim a third			0
@entity138 released @entity48 and the @entity139 ran half the length of the field before picking out @entity37 to coolly fire home			0
needing five goals to qualify for the final , @entity29 's case looked hopeless and so it proved			2
real , happy to sit and defend deep , was rarely troubled and only a fine reflex save by @entity110 prevented @entity147 from adding a fourth			0
@entity29 enjoyed plenty of possession after the interval but @entity151 in the @entity2 goal was rarely tested			2
in the end , it was left to @entity37 to have the final word			2
with just over a minute of normal time remaining , the @entity156 star unleashed a low free - kick which flew past @entity110 to add further gloss			0
" @entity4 " is within touching distance -- only @entity19 or a certain mr @entity20 can stop @entity2 now .			1

@entity2 qualifies for @entity28 final
@entity2 wins 4 - 0 on night , 5 - 0 on aggregate
