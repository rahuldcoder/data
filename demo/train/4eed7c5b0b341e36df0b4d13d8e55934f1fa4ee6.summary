on both sides of the @entity4 - @entity3 border , key questions are lingering after @entity3 's presidential vote			1
election authorities projected @entity7 of the @entity8 , or @entity8 , as the winner sunday night			1
but his closest competitor , @entity10 of the @entity11 , or @entity11 , has not conceded			0
the election results raise issues rooted in @entity3 's complicated political past that will play a critical role in shaping the nation 's future , analysts say			1
has the @entity8 , a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt , changed its approach in @entity3 ? will @entity10 and his supporters protest the election results as they have in the past ? and will @entity7 's proposal to decrease violence mark a significant shift in @entity4 - @entity3 drug war policy ? @entity3 's old guard is back on the local level , there may not be many differences between today 's @entity8 and the political party that dominated @entity3 for decades , said @entity34 , director of the @entity35 at the @entity36			1
" what 's changed on the national stage is that @entity3 citizens have different expectations for their federal government that are going to force the @entity8 to govern in a different way than it did 20 years ago , " @entity34 said			1
" then , the @entity8 was really a party that included all of @entity3 , that had a broad patronage network and tolerated little dissent outside of the party			1
and the @entity8 today is going to have to deal with opposition parties that have tasted power , an active citizenry that expects to be involved in major policies decisions and a very vigilant press that will report on everything that happens			2
" sunday 's election was closer than many expected , @entity34 said , and @entity7 and @entity8 party leaders realize they secured a narrow victory			1
" i get the sense the @entity8 recognizes that they are going to have to build broader coalitions in order to govern effectively , " he said			1
only time will tell , said @entity61 , a professor at @entity3 's @entity62 in @entity63			1
" the truth is that we do n't know very well who the @entity8 is now , " he said			1
and it 's unclear how influential leaders from the party 's old guard -- some of whom have close ties with @entity7 -- will be , he said			1
in the past , presidential candidates have said one thing on the campaign trail , then done something else in office			0
" we do n't really know how he is going to behave			2
... now we are going to see , who is @entity7 , truly ? " @entity61 said			2
@entity4 rep. @entity81 , a @entity82 from the border city of @entity84 , @entity85 , said the answer is clear			0
he is a young , outgoing personality , " said @entity81 , who describes @entity7 as a friend and flew to @entity88 over the weekend to support the candidate			2
" he 's from a young , new generation			2
he 'll bring a lot of fresh , new ideas			0
" an ' explosive ' mixture ? critics of the 45 - year - old former governor are n't convinced			1
weeks before sunday 's vote , criticisms of @entity7 and concerns about the @entity8 's possible return to power fueled a student movement that has staged demonstrations throughout the country			1
" there 's a lot of angry voters			2
the question mark is , what are they going to do ? " said @entity108 , a security analyst and former @entity110 official who lives in @entity88			1
in 2006 , @entity10 's supporters protested nationwide after election authorities said he narrowly lost to @entity116 in presidential elections			2
how will @entity8 's win change the @entity4 - @entity3 relationship ? @entity10 claimed election fraud and never conceded , referring to himself as " the legitimate president of @entity3			1
" in @entity88 , his followers staged massive sit - ins and blockades			0
it 's unclear , @entity108 said , whether protesters will take a similar approach this time around , or try something more severe			2
" in a country like @entity3 , where we already have a high incidence of violence due to organized crime , add to that social unrest , and it could be an explosive mixture , " she said			1
" i certainly hope not , but we will soon find out			0
" the @entity35 's @entity34 said @entity10 's reaction sunday night signaled that any protests this year are likely to be less intense			2
the former @entity88 mayor was measured in response to the results of sunday night 's quick count , which placed him at least 6 percentage points behind @entity7			1
rather than relying on the quick count , which is based on samples from polls nationwide , @entity10 said he would wait for results from the final official vote tally , which begins wednesday			2
" we are going to have all the information and at that time we will establish a position , " he said			0
after the 2006 vote , which gave @entity116 a narrow victory margin of less than 1 % , @entity10 was quick to declare fraud			0
the difference in reaction is significant , @entity34 said monday			0
" the fact that @entity10 did not call for mobilization last night means that he 's already tipped his hand to accepting the results when they come out			0
he essentially demobilized his supporters , " @entity34 said			0
a different drug war approach ? beyond @entity3 's borders , part of @entity7 's campaign platform has been a focal point for @entity4 officials and lawmakers : @entity7 's pledge to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the @entity4			1
" i am convinced that in terms of security , we need to adjust the policy to keep confronting organized crime , criminal gangs and cartel chiefs head - on , " @entity7 told @entity173 monday			1
" but we also have to search for a strategy , a reduction of violence in this country			0
... the strategy we follow in the short term clear signs of better effectiveness and a reduction in crime rates			0
" announcing a crackdown on cartels and sending troops into the streets to help fight the battle were among the first major moves by @entity116 after he took office in december 2006			0
and for nearly six years , a brutal drug war in @entity3 with a staggering death toll of more than 47,500 people has dominated discussions between the @entity4 and @entity3			2
some political opponents of @entity7 , whose party governed @entity3 for more than 70 years until 2000 , have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that @entity7 has repeatedly denied			1
but his denials have n't squelched speculation on both sides of the border that negotiating with cartels -- or at least easing the pressure on them -- could be on the table			0
in a congressional hearing last month , @entity4 rep. @entity216 said the war on drugs was nearing a " potential crossroad , " referring to @entity7 's plan and his party 's political history			1
" while in power , the @entity8 minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels , " the @entity225 @entity224 said , noting that @entity7 " does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins			1
" in a statement the next day , @entity7 's campaign said he was committed to combating organized crime			1
" the law is applied ; it is never negotiated , " the statement said			0
@entity81 , the @entity85 congressman , said this week that such concerns from @entity216 and other lawmakers were unfounded			0
changing strategies in dealing with drug violence , @entity81 said , does n't mean stopping the battle			0
" i asked him about it			0
... he told me , ' i 'm gon na fight it			0
i want to use a different strategy , ' " @entity81 said , noting that relations between the @entity4 and @entity3 would likely strengthen under @entity7 's leadership			1
pledges to change tack in the drug war were common across party lines on the presidential campaign trail this year , @entity61 said			0
" in the end , i do n't think he will do many things differently than @entity116 , because there is n't much that can be done differently , " @entity61 said			0
" there 's not a lot of room to work			0
in speeches , it sounds really great to say that you 're going to do things differently , but there wo n't be many changes			0
" @entity268 : @entity3 on the rise 8 things @entity4 could learn from @entity3			2

projected winner @entity7 says he remains committed to cartel fight
former @entity110 official : social unrest after the election " could be an explosive mixture "
analyst : @entity3 " are going to force the @entity8 to govern in a different way "
@entity7 says he 's part of a new generation , but critics are n't convinced
