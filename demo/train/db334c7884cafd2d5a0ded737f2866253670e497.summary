-- although the bombs went off miles from her house , the young woman in @entity2 still felt them in her gut			2
boom ! her windows rattled as she ran to her computer			2
" what happened ? ! ? ! ? ! ? " she typed furiously into @entity9 , sending the message to her friends			2
what @entity13 heard was the thunderous clap of two car bombs exploding outside a @entity18 air force intelligence compound outside @entity2 monday night			1
the web of tweeters , @entity21 and skypers that have helped keep younger @entity18 informed about the war that 's been raging in their country the past year and a half answered her soon enough			1
" it was a moment of slight shock when i knew that the blast was in the air force intelligence branch , " she told @entity0			1
" i have always heard stories about that place			1
former detainees call it a hellhole			2
" it is certainly one of the worst detaining centers ever			2
" @entity13 is not her real name			2
the young woman is an activist who has protested against the @entity18 government , and she insisted on using an alias to protect her against reprisals for talking to reporters			1
air force intelligence , known as the @entity47 , is considered the elite , primary agency of @entity18 's intelligence matrix			1
there are 17 branches of @entity18 intelligence , according to @entity18 experts			1
president @entity54 relies on @entity47 to gather information on rebels fighting to oust him			1
the opposition @entity58 raised the possibility that " hundreds of regime forces " were killed in the attack , but concrete casualty figures were impossible to obtain			1
government opponents also said they feared for the lives of " hundreds if not thousands of anti-government detainees that are being held in the basements of the air force security compound			1
" the strike could hurt @entity54 because the intelligence agency is such an important branch of the president 's security and spying apparatus			1
" depending on the number of people killed , this could be a severe blow to the regime , " said @entity75 , a @entity76 history professor who spent a good deal of time with @entity54 in @entity18 before the uprising , interviewing him and those close to him			1
@entity75 has written two books about @entity18 and the @entity85			1
" a strike at a compound like that could be a major blow symbolically but also practically with all the listening devices and tools perhaps destroyed , " he said			1
the air force intelligence agency runs detention facilities in major cities			1
in one @entity97 report this year , former detainees described being beaten , whipped and electrocuted and burned with hot water and acid in a center run by air force personnel			0
in one account , a detainee said he was forced into a " flying carpet " position -- where someone is forced onto their belly as their arms and hands tied are tied behind them			0
some detainees said they were strung up by their hands for hours at a time			0
the use of torture by those who ostensibly answer to the regime has been well - documented throughout the @entity18 war			1
@entity121 , a 31 - year - old teacher who lives in a @entity2 suburb , recalled feeling creeped out every time she walked past the compound			1
" it was a dirty place , horrifying , " she said			2
" i know deep in my heart there are innocent people down there being tortured			1
i could smell blood and hear the sounds of screams			0
i feel death is there			0
" she also felt the bombs go off			0
" it was a very noisy night and hectic , " she said			0
" there were many explosions around @entity2			0
" @entity140 's army shelled @entity142 's neighborhood			0
she figured it was in retaliation for the bombs			0
" it was clear they were freaking out and just shooting and shelling randomly , " she said			0
" they are really intimidated and when they get afraid , they just start shooting everywhere at anything that moves in every part of @entity2			0
" " it is the worst feeling in the world , " she continued			0
" the sound of the mortar when it flies directly above your building -- sssssssssss -- through the air			0
you lose your breath for a moment and deep in your heart you know someone was killed			0
" it 's really hard and really painful			0
i would rather be shelled than hear the sound of shelling in other areas			0
" rebels fighting to oust @entity54 told @entity0 that they fear many detainees were killed in the blasts			1
opposition forces are not the ones claiming to have targeted the air force intelligence compound			2
" we ... fear for the lives of hundreds if not thousands of anti-government detainees that are being held in the basements of the air force security compound , " said @entity179 of the opposition @entity58			1
a shadowy jihadist group called @entity187 claimed to have set off the bombs , according to an online statement that appeared on jihadist websites tuesday			1
the organization came to prominence during the @entity18 uprising , and has claimed several high - profile strikes at the heart of the @entity18 capital in the past several months			1
the group explained that tuesday 's attack had three stages : first , a suicide car bomb carrying 9 tons of explosives detonated at the gates of the building ; second , 25 minutes later , a suicide bomber drove an ambulance carrying 1 ton of explosives , detonating where air force troops were awaiting treatment ; third , a mortar barrage aimed at the site of the blast			1
@entity75 pointed out that even if an entire building were decimated , many other parts of the intelligence apparatus remain in @entity18			1
the @entity85 established the complex web to ensure that no single group had power , and other groups could step in if one group was undermined			2
the singular importance of the @entity47 goes back to @entity222 , @entity54 's father , @entity75 explained			1
@entity222 was a commander in the air force in the 1960s before a coup enabled him to take control of @entity18 in 1970			1
" the air force intelligence has always been close to the @entity85 , " he said			2
as the war has dragged on , @entity54 has repeatedly blamed " terrorists " for the violence in his country			1
opposition fighters blame his regime for causing most of the bloodshed			2
between these two versions stands what has become increasingly apparent -- there are likely jihadists and foreign fighters active in @entity18			1
some of these fighters are with groups linked to @entity241			0
their presence , many experts say , makes it far less likely that the @entity244 would involve itself in the @entity18 conflict			1
last september , @entity13 said , a @entity18 air force intelligence officer pointed his gun at her head			1
the air force was trying to break up an anti-al - @entity54 protest			1
" there was one thing in his eyes , " she said			0
" ' shoot the target			0
' it did not matter that i was a woman			0
" some of the protestors created a diversion near the air force officer , shouting and yelling at him			0
he turned and they all scattered			0
@entity13 and her friends escaped , she said , but four people were killed in the protest that day			2
everyone fears the air force intelligence branch of the @entity18 military , she said			1
@entity121 believes the regime has laid down increasing firepower to get back at those it perceives have attacked it			2
she also used an alias , fearing reprisals if she spoke to a reporter using her real name			0
" they arrest more people , humiliate more people , harass more people , " she said			2
" maybe it 's a way of boosting the soldiers ' confidence			0
they let them do what they want and kill who they want			0
" on tuesday morning , @entity142 still headed to her teaching job in central @entity2			2
she could n't take public transportation			0
all roads leading to the capital were closed , and men at a checkpoint would not grant entry to most civilians , she said			0
" the city is closed , " @entity142 said			0
" all cars were forced to turn around , so the roads are empty			0

" this is the largest blast i have ever felt since the uprising began , " said @entity318 , an opposition activist			0
" one of my windows is blown out , and neighbors ' plates were knocked down from the table to the ground			0
" less than half an hour later , @entity318 said , there was another explosion , followed by intermittent gunfire as a thick plume of smoke unfurled across the capital			0

at least one person was killed and several homes destroyed " due to the heavy and indiscriminate shelling " of the suburb , the @entity342 said			0
there were also reports of shelling in @entity350 and @entity351 provinces			0
rebel forces took complete control of the town of @entity355 in @entity351 province after 48 hours of clashes and shelling from regime forces			2
a highway connecting @entity2 to @entity350 runs through the town			0
@entity362 , a citizen journalist in @entity351 province , told @entity0 that over a year ago , @entity18 troops set up eight military posts in the town , which has a population of about 140,000 people			1
the bases were to protect the highway from opposition attacks , with each post having between 70 and 100 @entity18 troops , along with tanks , heavy and light weapons among other resources , he said			1
local residents claim troops used the posts as bases to launch attacks on civilian areas			0
on monday afternoon , thousands of rebel troops overran the military posts , using tanks , rocket fire , rocket - propelled grenades and gunfire , @entity362 said			2
the regime responded with heavy firepower			2
some troops were killed , the journalist said , and others were captured by the opposition			0
twenty - nine people were killed in @entity351 , the @entity342 said			1
in another @entity2 suburb , @entity395 , at least 25 bodies clustered together were found burned , the opposition group said			2
the @entity342 said 197 people were reported dead across @entity18 on tuesday			1
@entity0 is unable to independently confirm reports of casualties or violence because the @entity18 government has restricted access by international journalists .			1
