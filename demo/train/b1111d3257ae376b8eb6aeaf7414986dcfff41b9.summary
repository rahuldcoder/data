-- like the moment that @entity3 first learned he was a wizard , @entity1 can vividly recall when he first heard of the adventures of the " boy who lived			1
" " it was the summer between my kindergarten and first - grade years when my mom returned home from the bookstore with a copy of ' @entity14 , ' " he said			0
" she laid the paperback down on our kitchen table and told me that a number of her friends had told her that the ' @entity3 ' books were wonderful stories , and she wanted me to try ' @entity22			1
' my mom offered to read it aloud to me			0
" he said he was instantly mesmerized once she started reading it to him			0
" after a few more nights of reading with my mom , i could restrain myself no longer , and i picked up the book and began to read it on my own			0
" he was about to enter first grade , but the @entity31 , @entity32 , resident soon devoured the first four " @entity3 " books , and a few years later , he made that fateful journey to the bookstore to pick up the final book , " @entity37			1
" he can even remember the number of the reserved copy that the store called for him to pick up : 372			0
he said the dedication spoke deeply to him , and he recalls reflecting on the series after nine hours of reading the final part of the story			0
" these fantastic books have made a profound impact on my life , " he said			2
" these books have shaped the way i think , act and live			1
" he sees @entity3 as a friend whom he knows better than some of his real friends , and @entity54 as a mentor			1
@entity56 is one of many @entity57 who said that they felt a kinship to @entity3 , having literally grown up with the character			1
a lasting friendship @entity62 of @entity63 met her best friend , @entity64 , through " @entity3 " : " when we were in third grade , we were hanging out in her room ( i was already obsessed with ' @entity3 ' ) , and i asked her if she 'd ever heard of ' @entity3			1
' she said yes , she 'd seen a couple of the movies			2
somehow i got her to read the books and she began to love it , too			2
we became so close so quickly -- all because of ' @entity3			1
' " ' @entity3 ' fans line up for grand adieu since then , the pair has seen every movie since " @entity78 " together , and went on thursday night to see the midnight showing of the final film			1
she describes their relationship as " closer than sisters			0
" " her ' altar ego ' is @entity87 , and mine is @entity89 , " she said			0
" thank you , @entity91			0
because of you , i have the best friend a girl could ask for			0
" the lessons of ' @entity3 ' for @entity97 , it was an encounter with @entity91 that started her on the way to making @entity3 a significant part of her life			1
the author was signing books at her elementary school , and her friend got a signed copy of one of the " @entity3 " books , which peaked @entity110 's interest			1
" once i started reading ' @entity113 , " i could n't put them down , " she said			0
" i loved that the hero was young and easy to relate to			0
@entity3 could be anyone , since he is grounded in the real world , but is then whisked away to the wizarding world			1
" the @entity120 , @entity121 , resident said she has learned many life lessons from the stories : " ( the books ) taught me about right and wrong , and how the ends do not justify the means			2
the books also taught me about human nature , how your actions can have a significant effect way down the line			2
" she would greatly anticipate every new installment , going to sites such as @entity135 to find out anything she could about the next book			0
now that the books and movies have come to an end , she does n't see them going away anytime soon			1
" certainly @entity3 will live on in events like @entity144 , which i do n't see slowing down anytime soon			1
many colleges have already recognized it as a sport , " she said			0
( in fact , she took part in the @entity151 in @entity152			0
) " with bands like @entity154 , the @entity155 , the @entity156 , the @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity3 will have a place in music as well			1
" an ' @entity161 ' of friends @entity163 from @entity164 , @entity165 -- who , at 21 , is the same age as @entity3 would be now -- remembers the moment in 1998 when her friend lent her the first book			2
" i 've been captivated ever since , " she said			0
in high school , she and a group of friends would constantly discuss the books and movies , and dressed up as " @entity161 " during their school 's homecoming week			2
this tradition extended to the openings of each film			0
" i love @entity181 , so i tied up my long hair in a bun and stuffed it under a red wig that my mom and i cut ourselves from a ' @entity189 ' @entity188 wig , " she said			0
she said that she posted an @entity190 to let her friends know that she was thinking of them when she went to see the final movie since she is doing an internship out of town			1
more " @entity3 " stories inspired by the wizarding world @entity197 remembers being disappointed at age 11 -- soon after he began reading the books -- when an owl did n't arrive to whisk him away to @entity201			1
instead , the books inspired him to create more art. he made a stop - motion animated film of the first book			2
he drew scenes from the books , or created new scenes he hoped to see in future books			2
he wrote fan fiction and went on to write his own 200 - page fantasy story			0
" i would often play the movies on tv and mute it , and watching the action onscreen , improvise new songs , " he said , adding he 's interested in a career in writing musical scores for movies			2
he said @entity91 's rags - to - riches success and the imaginative stories stirred a passion for artistic expression			0
whether " @entity3 " influenced art , relationships or simply the pure joy of reading , it 's clear the books and movies wo n't soon be forgotten , especially for those who grew up with them			1
as @entity56 put it , " ' @entity3 ' has defined my generation , and while our ' @entity3 ' era may be drawing to a close , the series will live on forever			1
