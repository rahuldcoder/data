-- @entity1 lives near the @entity4 - @entity3 border with his wife @entity5 , in a house that he built with his own hands , on the same property where he grew up			1
he served in the @entity9 in @entity10			2
the @entity11 have a long , proud tradition of military service , but their family 's greatest losses have been to heart disease			2
" our family has shrunk tremendously			0
we 've lost so many people through death , " @entity5 says			1
in 1992 , @entity1 's brother @entity20 died in his arms , suffering a heart attack on their kitchen floor			1
parents , siblings , aunts , uncles and cousins have all died from complications from heart disease , too			0
the @entity11 point them out in a graveyard near their home			0
@entity1 and @entity5 have both had heart attacks , and both have stents holding their blood vessels open			1
the birth of their grandson @entity40 led them to try harder to extend their lives			0
so last year , the couple joined the @entity46 for reversing @entity47			0
@entity48 , the government health insurance program for @entity50 65 and older , covers the @entity52 program , which teaches a plant - based , meatless diet , meditation and regular exercise			1
the program was officially declared an intensive cardiac rehab program in 2010 , and the first patients started in may 2011			1
@entity60 is a persistent advocate within the halls of government			0
there are mountains of scientific evidence that his recommended lifestyle changes do reverse heart disease , the no. 1 killer in the @entity50 and worldwide			0
helping patients make these lifestyle changes costs @entity48 about $ 70 per hour , and patients can receive up to 72 one - hour sessions			1
proponents of preventative medicine point out that that cost is still much less than operations and medications			0
@entity60 believes that fear can not motivate lifestyle change in people long - term			2
@entity82 has to be about feeling better and having more zest for life			0
the greater the change , the better the feeling , he says			0
that seems to ring true for the @entity11			0
despite the grim history of heart disease , they say it 's how good they feel that keeps them living the lifestyle that their neighbors sometimes find strange			0
" if i was going to be able to participate as a grandparent in his life , that gave me another incentive , that really did , " @entity5 explains			1
" but in order to do that , i needed to feel good about myself first			0
" the @entity108 ' favorite yoga positions are " cobra " and " fish , " and their favorite pizza is meatless meat - lovers , made with soy pepperoni and soy " ground beef			1
" " usually at the end of the session , the instructor will say , ' now the reward , get into the total relaxation pose , ' and we do that , and it just feels so good , " @entity5 says			2
together the @entity11 have lost 85 pounds on the program , and @entity1 is off of four medications			1
hospitals can now bill @entity48 for their patient 's yoga and group discussion sessions because the @entity130 program is an approved intensive cardiac rehab program , a new class of cardiac rehab created by @entity134 in 2009			1
traditional cardiac rehab , developed in the 1950s and covered by @entity48 since 1982 , focuses almost exclusively on exercise -- getting patients out of bed and the blood flowing again			1
but in the 1970s , @entity60 and others began leading experiments to test whether improving diet and stress levels could make a difference for those with heart disease			2
in the following decades the researchers published volumes of studies in peer - reviewed journals that became the basis of the @entity46 for @entity153			1
there are four components to the program : nutrition , stress management , moderate exercise and group support			2
part of the underlying cause for widespread heart disease , explains @entity60 , is chronic loneliness and isolation , which lead to stress and bad habits			0
when people feel emotionally close to others , they 're physiologically healthier , too , so @entity48 is paying for it			2
" the reason that i spent 16 years working with the @entity174 to achieve @entity48 coverage for our program is that i knew that most insurance companies follow @entity48 's lead			1
in other words , if @entity48 covered our program , most other insurance companies would , as well , " explains @entity60 , who also says he was once naive in thinking that solid science alone would be enough to change health care policy			1
" reimbursement as well as science are primary determinants of medical practice			0
if it 's not reimbursable , it 's not sustainable			0

@entity190 for @entity153 is covered by @entity48

@entity5 and @entity1 have lost 85 pounds on the program
