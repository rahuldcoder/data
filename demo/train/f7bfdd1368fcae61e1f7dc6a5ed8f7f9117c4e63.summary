-- @entity2 star @entity1 plans to thank the people who helped save his life a year ago as he makes an emotional return to @entity6 this week			1
the @entity8 driver suffered horrific head injuries after a freak accident during the second qualifying session for the 2009 race in @entity13 , when a spring from another car smashed into his helmet			1
the @entity17 was ruled out for the rest of the season , but has returned this year alongside new teammate @entity20			2
" my first meeting when i arrive at the @entity24 circuit will be with all the marshals and medical staff who did such a very good job of carefully getting me out of the cockpit , " he told the @entity2 website on wednesday			1
" i want to thank these people , with whom i now feel a special bond			2
i had to stay in hospital for a week after the accident and i got to know the staff , who all treated me so well -- and one unusual result of the whole unfortunate episode is that i know i now have a lot more fans in @entity6			1
" the 29 - year - old was a close runner - up in the 2008 world championship to this year 's leader @entity42 , but has had only two podium finishes on his return to the @entity46 team			0
he finished second in the opening race of 2010 in @entity48 behind @entity20 , and then repeated that result in @entity50 last weekend in controversial circumstances as he appeared to allow his teammate to pass him after receiving instructions on his radio			0
@entity8 boss slams @entity2 ' hypocrisy ' " quite often this year , journalists ask me if i feel i am back to normal and if i am driving as well as before and my answer is always the same : yes , in terms of my work , absolutely nothing has changed , " @entity1 said			1
" but as a person , the accident did change me			0
it made me value life much more than before , and i appreciate the ordinary things in life 10 times more , and it has put life and my health in perspective , not taking anything for granted and not just for me , but also for life in general and what it means to everyone			1
" i know what it means now and i feel i am much more mature as a human being			0
however , on the professional front , nothing has changed , because once you shut the visor and go out on the race track , you just do everything as before , without thinking of the accident			0
" @entity1 hopes @entity8 can build on the @entity86 performance at a circuit where he has never won			1
" @entity88 is bringing its super-soft and medium tires that have always suited the @entity90 very well , so maybe we can have another very competitive race , " he said			0
" personally , i have never had a good result at this circuit , but that has simply been down to circumstances , as i do enjoying driving here a lot			0
in 2008 for example , the last time i actually raced here , i led for 60 laps until my engine failed			0
" @entity8 fined as @entity20 denies @entity1 @entity20 , who moved to within 34 points of @entity42 with his second victory of the season , has better history at the venue -- though he failed to finish last year after starting from pole , with @entity42 the victor for @entity110			1
" the @entity24 is a special circuit for me			0
it was here in 2003 that i scored my first @entity2 win , " the @entity112 said			1
" the track can almost be described as a go - kart track for @entity2 cars			2
the corners follow on , one from the other , so there is nowhere for a driver to pause for breath , and it is vital to have a car that deals with the many bumps in the track surface and handles riding the kerbs			2
" from the physical and mental point of view it is a pretty demanding race , so it is important not to get impetuous and overcook things , because any mistake is heavily penalized , especially in qualifying			0
" meanwhile , the future of the @entity138 has been assured after its organizers agreed a new 10 - year deal with @entity2 supremo @entity141			1
@entity141 met @entity143 de @entity145 president @entity144 in @entity146 on wednesday to seal the agreement , the official @entity2 website reported .			2

@entity1 returns to @entity6 just over a year after he almost died in freak accident
@entity8 driver was hit in the head by a *flying* car part during qualifying in @entity13
he says he plans to thank the people who helped to save his life that day
