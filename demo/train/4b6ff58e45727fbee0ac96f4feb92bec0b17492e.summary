-- when the @entity1 calls for secretary of veterans affairs gen. @entity2 to resign , you know something is profoundly wrong			1
in a statement entitled " @entity7 , " ' @entity5 , national commander of the @entity1 , said , " his record as the head of the @entity10 ... tells a story of bureaucratic incompetence and failed leadership			1
" " the disturbing reports coming from the @entity15 are just one of what appears to be a pattern of scandals that have infected the entire system , " @entity5 continued			2
" it has been more than 20 years since the @entity1 has called for the resignation of a public official			1
it 's not something we do lightly			0
we do this because of people who have been failed by the system			0
" note the key charge : " a pattern of scandals that have infected the entire system			2
" this is an historic opportunity for @entity34 to look beyond personality and scapegoating and to take seriously the potential for a " breakout " that would replace the current breakdown with a new @entity10 capable of serving today 's veterans with modern technologies and standards			1
@entity34 should start by looking at institutions that handle people and information effectively , accurately and with great accountability			0
the next time you make an airline or hotel reservation , ask why the @entity10 ca n't be that customer - friendly			1
the next time you use your smartphone , ask why there is n't a " veterans app " that makes it easier for our veterans to keep track of their va appointments , records , diagnoses , etc. the next time you use an atm machine to get cash in less than 11 seconds , ask why it can take 175 days to transfer a veteran from the @entity64 to the @entity10			1
in contrast to the modern systems we deal with on a daily basis , the @entity10 bureaucracy is a disaster			1
a former chief of staff of the @entity73 , gen. @entity71 used to have a saying about large organizations : " they are all lakes of mediocrity dotted by islands of excellence			2
" today even this is too generous a description of what modern bureaucracy has become			1
in many federal agencies , we have islands of corruption rising from a sea of incompetence			0
few parts of the federal government exemplify both types of terrain so well as the @entity10			1
as @entity5 's call for @entity2 to resign indicates , stories of corruption and incompetence -- potentially criminal conduct -- at the @entity10 have become so common that they outrage but no longer surprise			1
several weeks ago , i wrote about a former @entity10 employee 's allegation that agency employees in @entity103 intentionally destroyed veterans ' medical records to eliminate the shameful backlog of patients waiting for appointments -- many of them for months or even years			1
@entity0 recently followed that report of fraud with an infuriating story of its own , the story to which the @entity1 commander referred about the misconduct of @entity10 officials in @entity117			1
the report described allegations that these bureaucrats conspired to hide their backlog from superiors in @entity123 by maintaining a secret waiting list of hundreds or even thousands of veterans who waited months for care before the @entity10 entered those patients into its computer system once it was able to schedule an appointment			1
and in march , the @entity133 reported that top - level managers in @entity135 remained in their positions despite a special counsel 's report of wrongdoing , including a whistleblower 's allegation that patients were prescribed narcotics without seeing a doctor			2
note that in each of these cases , the general incompetence and mismanagement at the @entity10 is so severe that engaging in potentially criminal conduct appears to all involved to be a preferable system -- until someone finds out about it , that is			1
some of the corrupt officials engage in outright theft			0
in february , a former @entity10 medical center director in @entity156 pleaded guilty to 64 charges			1
his crimes , according to the @entity160 newspaper in @entity161 , included " money laundering , wire fraud , mail fraud and conspiring to defraud the @entity10 through bribery and kickback schemes in which he accepted tens of thousands of dollars from contractors in exchange for inside information			1
" in fact , if you want to see how bad the corruption at the @entity10 is , just take a look at the list of press releases on the va inspector general 's website			2
there are many headlines such as " @entity181 pleads guilty to @entity182 , " " former va claims examiner pleads guilty to @entity182 , @entity185 and @entity186 , " and " @entity187 and @entity188 to embezzling nearly $ 900,000			0
" the @entity10 does n't need to employ criminals to lose large sums of money , however			1
it 's capable of losing taxpayer funds all on its own through sheer incompetence			0
as of february , there were 400,000 disability claims considered " backlogged			0
" that is , they 've been in processing for more than 125 days			0
as one veteran of combat in @entity206 told us , " appointments are so far back it 's ridiculous and claims are even further behind			0
... you can definitely get an appointment -- it 's just going to be three to six months down the road			0
" to fix this mess , the @entity10 created a new program , the @entity213			2
but as the @entity214 describes a new report by the department 's inspector general , " poor planning , slow software and cost overruns raise the spectre that the $ 500 million electronic document system being deployed by the @entity10 will not break the months - long delays to process disability compensation claims			1
" the computer system started out flawed as millions of dollars were spent to scan files " without a clear plan , " the result being that users had to " wade through hundreds of pages of electronic documents , sometimes for hours , to find the information they needed			0
" and it still takes employees longer to create a claim in the new system , which reportedly crashes on a regular basis , than it did in the old one			0
we probably should not be surprised at this money being spent to build systems that work just as poorly as the ones they replace			0
the @entity10 and @entity64 have spent $ 1.3 billion over the past four years attempting unsuccessfully to develop a single system for electronic health records			2
this record of corruption and incompetence is nothing to be proud of , and certainly nothing to reward			0
in fact , it 's intolerable			0
senior va officials , however , are not only keeping their jobs but are receiving bonuses			0
from 2007 to 2011 , the bureaucrats in charge of the @entity10 distributed nearly $ 17 million in " extra compensation " to senior officials at a time when hundreds of thousands of veterans ' claims were backlogged			1
at a facility in @entity265 , employees were given bonuses despite the fact that 29 veterans contracted legionnaires ' disease , five of whom died			2
with 13 years of continuous war behind us and an aging population of veterans from previous wars , the workload at the @entity10 is only going to increase			1
this is not a temporary problem , and our veterans are not just going to disappear			2
in fact , as time goes on , there will likely be more of a demand for care since issues such as ptsd sometimes do not manifest themselves until years later			0
in a big bureaucracy , people are promised comfortable jobs ; it 's difficult to fire them , and they are typically not held to any real performance standards			2
this breeds an environment favoring incompetence and corruption			0
we can not allow this kind of behavior to undermine those @entity10 employees , some of whom are veterans themselves , who are working hard to help			1
and we can not allow employees who are trying to do the right thing to be dominated and corrupted by incompetent leadership			2
we have to fix it , and that has to start by holding officials responsible for doing their jobs			0
as @entity314 chairman @entity313 has said , " what 's missing from the equation is not money or manpower , it 's accountability			0
" @entity313 has proposed a bill that would make it easier to fire employees for poor performance , and sen. @entity323 has offered a companion bill that would eliminate some of the red tape designed to make it impossible to fire public employees			0
replacing the department 's senior leadership would be a start			0
but in fact , the entire @entity10 model needs to be replaced			2
the current system is an obsolete , paper - based bureaucracy incapable of serving @entity336 's veterans			1
a truly modern @entity10 would be digital , mobile , virtual and personal			1
we owe it to our veterans to get the replacement right .			0

@entity1 has called for @entity10 secretary to quit after recent scandals
@entity345 says @entity10 is a *hopelessly* *outdated* , incompetent bureaucracy
why ca n't the @entity10 be as customer - friendly as many modern organizations ?
@entity351 : it should be competent , digital and personal in serving our veterans
