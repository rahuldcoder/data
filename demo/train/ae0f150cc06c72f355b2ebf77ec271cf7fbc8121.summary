-- one was the archetypal military strongman , intent on maintaining the social order and saving his country from " catastrophe			0
" the other was a charismatic shipyard electrician and trade union leader who was just as determined to lead his countrymen to freedom			0
@entity9 and @entity10 attend the first multi-party session of the @entity13 parliament in 1989			1
yet nowadays @entity9 , the last leader of communist @entity13 , and @entity10 both claim , in their different ways , to have played their part in setting @entity13 on the path to democracy			1
the rise of @entity22 , the union and social movement which @entity10 founded among the dockers of @entity25 in 1980 , was crucial to the ultimate collapse of communism in @entity13 and across the @entity29 bloc			1
feted in the @entity30 , @entity10 was awarded the @entity31 in 1983 after spending nearly a year locked up as @entity9 clamped down on dissent , becoming a symbol of a rising tide of resentment behind the @entity36			1
by 1989 , @entity22 had become an unstoppable social movement , sweeping to victory as the communist authorities relinquished their grip on power by allowing free elections			2
@entity10 describes the union as a screw turning in the opposite direction to the communist regime , ultimately " destroying the engine			2
" " the system was 10 times less efficient than the western system , " @entity10 told @entity0 , recalling his decade - long struggle			1
" it paid less , life was worse			0
each country enslaved by the @entity29 was different and in @entity13 we had tv and people could travel so we knew life could be better ... and we 'd never given up			2
" but @entity9 still believes that without his decision to impose martial law in 1981 , @entity13 's revolt against @entity29 domination would have been as ruthlessly and violently quashed by @entity60 as had those in @entity62 in 1956 and @entity63 in 1968			1
" for me personally it was a great tragedy , the consequences of which i 've felt to this day , " @entity9 told @entity0			1
" martial law was evil			1
but it was less evil than the real and inevitable threat we were facing			0
there was a threat of an explosion -- and an explosion in @entity13 would have meant an explosion throughout @entity75			2
" as a key link in the @entity29 's chain of @entity79 satellite states , @entity9 believes @entity60 would never have allowed @entity13 to break away peacefully : " i feared a terrible catastrophe			1
if martial law had not happened , @entity13 might have been flooded by a sea of blood			1
" @entity10 admits the threat of @entity29 intervention in the early 1980s was real , but says @entity22 had already won the argument against communism by the time @entity9 imposed martial law			1
" i knew we were not going to fight , " he said			0
" because in @entity13 there were over 200,000 @entity29 troops , they had nuclear arms , and they shot better than us			2
we could conquer them only this way : you can arrest us , but when we come out we do the same , and we will never work for communism again			0
" even his arrest and imprisonment only deepened @entity10 's belief that @entity9 's government could be toppled : " my friends advised me to run away but i made a different decision			1
when they came to arrest me , i said , ' you have lost , i have won			0
you have just put the last nails into the coffin of communism			0
' " these days @entity9 is no defender of the system which he served , describing communism as " beautiful and noble , but utopian			2
" yet he believes @entity22 's demands in the early 1980s amounted to an " economic time bomb " and that @entity13 was not ready for democracy at the time			1
" the system was bad , i admit it today , " he said			0
" but at the time , i was n't aware of that			0
everything has to ripen -- corn , fruit , man and societies			0
western countries took centuries to arrive at democracy			0
except for six or seven years after @entity124 had never been democratic so it was a difficult process			0
" the @entity13 authorities also realized the urgency of economic and political reform , @entity9 adds , and had already begun the process before the round table talks with @entity22 in 1989 that led to elections			1
" it was a difficult and painful process for both sides , " he said			0
" i can talk primarily of the government side , and what huge resistance i had to overcome among the people who were in power -- in the party , in the state , the army and the security apparatus			0
" both men pay tribute to outside forces which made the leap to democracy possible			0
for @entity9 , @entity148 's emergence in the @entity149 marked a " breakthrough moment " in which the threat of @entity29 military intervention in @entity13 was lifted , and a possible end to the @entity151 loomed into sight			1
@entity10 and @entity9 also acknowledge the unique role of the @entity13 - born pope @entity157 and the @entity158 in brokering peaceful talks between the two sides			1
for @entity9 , though , the fall of communism was not the product of @entity22 alone or a single summer of upheaval but " a great river made up of numerous streams			2
" " nobody should monopolize that victory , " he said			0
" because in this stream there was @entity148 ; there was @entity173 and then @entity174 , who caused the weakening of the @entity29 by the arms race ; there was @entity22 ; there was the pope , and there were also -- which i will say without humbleness -- the reformists within the authorities at the time			0
" both @entity9 and @entity10 paint themselves as reluctant leaders			1
@entity9 describes his decision to become @entity13 prime minister as " one of the greatest mistakes of my life , " while @entity10 , who was elected @entity13 president in 1990 , says it was never his wish to lead his country -- " but who else could have done it ? " @entity9 remains a divisive figure in modern @entity13 , derided by many as a living symbol of an oppressive past and occasionally summoned to court rooms to answer charges relating to his career as a leading servant of the communist regime			1
" my generation , which remembers those times and can evaluate them in a balanced way , is passing away , " he said			0
" and the new , younger generation , through school , books and tv , are being indoctrinated to be critical of martial law			2
still , a large part of the society -- the majority , i think -- considers martial law to have been inevitable and justified			2
" yet even @entity9 says @entity13 can be " proud " of their role in the downfall of communist regimes across @entity75 : " the @entity13 elections preceded the revolutions in @entity62 and in @entity63 and the fall of the @entity223			2
that impulse , that example that came from us , was of great significance and i think it is our great historical tribute			0
" @entity10 , unsurprisingly , offers a more direct assessment : " @entity13 knocked out the teeth of the @entity29 bear			2
once we had done that , knocking down the @entity223 , the @entity233 , all was made possible -- but only once the bear had no teeth			0
" @entity0 's @entity236 interviewed @entity9			1
