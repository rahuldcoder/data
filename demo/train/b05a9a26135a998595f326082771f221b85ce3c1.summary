-- the @entity2 's forest carbon scheme which has formed part of the negotiations at the climate talks in @entity6 has been one of the few areas where countries are broadly in agreement			1
the @entity2 's @entity11 ( @entity11 in @entity12 ) program is a collaboration between the @entity2 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and @entity16 ( @entity17 ) and development ( undp ) programs			1
@entity19 , head of the @entity2 - @entity11 program explained to @entity0 how the @entity11 program proposals would work			1
" in theory @entity11 is a system to provide incentives for countries not to cut their forests , " @entity19 said			1
" the incentive system is essentially that your trees are worth more standing than they are cut			1
you get a reward for not cutting your forests			0
" the idea is straightforward ; if the function of rainforests -- capturing carbon , water catchment , weather regulators and biodiversity -- is recognized their value will rise			0
the destruction of the world 's rainforests is estimated to contribute to as much as 20 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions			0
@entity11 envisages a situation whereby " different services can be marketed and paid for , boosting the incomes of other wise marginalized communities "			2
many pilot schemes are already underway			0
back in 1997 when the @entity54 was adopted , the part rainforests play in carbon storage was n't recognized			0
proposals to reduce emissions from deforestation were first introduced by the governments of @entity59 in december 2005 at the @entity61 talks in @entity62			2
talks at @entity6 are hoping to build on the progress made since			1
@entity11 say that more than 30 models of how the program should work have been put forward by countries , groups of countries and @entity70			1
@entity19 would n't be drawn on the outcome of negotiations at @entity6 when @entity0 spoke to him on thursday			2
critics of the @entity11 program argue that it allows richer countries to meet -- to buy essentially -- some of their emissions obligations without cutting them at all			1
others argue trying to measure what is being preserved and how much carbon is being stored will prove incredibly hard to quantify			0
but @entity19 said an imperfect program which can be improved is better than none at all			0
" we should stop focusing on the negatives issues of @entity11 and start looking at the positives			2
in the short term , @entity11 offers use the greatest mitigation potential at an affordable price and is the most cost effective			0

@entity2 - @entity11 program has received *widespread* support from countries at @entity6 talks
the incentive system would mean that trees are worth more standing than cut
critics argue that @entity11 allows rich countries to meet targets with cutting emissions
