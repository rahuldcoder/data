@entity0 -- @entity3 critics cranked up the political heat thursday on attorney general @entity5 , threatening impeachment and accusing him of withholding information from @entity8 about @entity9 , a severely flawed and discredited federal gun - sting program			1
at the end of a long , combative day of testimony before the @entity3 - controlled @entity15 , @entity12 @entity3 rep. @entity11 compared @entity5 to disgraced nixon - era attorney general @entity16			1
@entity5 shot back by comparing @entity11 to sen. @entity17 , the infamous @entity18 @entity3 censured by the @entity19 in 1954 for leading what critics called a @entity23 witch hunt			1
" as they said in the @entity26 , have you no shame ? " asked @entity5 , referencing a famous retort to @entity17			1
@entity5 acknowledged mistakes were made , but said he would not resign over the controversy			1
the attorney general , accusing the @entity3 of playing political games , said he also did n't think any of his top aides should step down			1
@entity9 , which started in 2009 , allowed illegally purchased firearms to be taken from gun stores in @entity36 across the @entity38 border to drug cartels			1
the intent of the operation was to monitor the flow of weapons to their ultimate destination			0
however , hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for , and a storm of outrage erupted when two of the missing weapons were found at a site where @entity51 agent @entity51 was killed in december 2010			0
democrats and @entity3 have since been at odds over who knew what about the operation and when			2
@entity58 @entity3 rep. @entity57 told @entity5 thursday that " heads should roll " over the matter			1
" there is really no responsibility within the @entity63 , " @entity57 said			2
" the thing is , if we do n't get to the bottom of this -- and that requires your assistance on that -- there is only one alternative that @entity8 has and it is called impeachment			0
" @entity57 did not make clear whether he was referring to the possible impeachment of @entity5 or other top @entity63 officials			1
blame for the botched operation " must go to your desk , " @entity11 , the @entity3 's point man on investigating @entity9 , told @entity5			1
@entity8 has been " systematically lied to " by department officials , he alleged			0
for his part , @entity5 told committee members the operation relied on " unacceptable tactics " and was " inexcusable			2
" but he insisted that @entity63 officials have cooperated with congressional investigators , and he said that any previous misleading information provided on the matter was not part of an intentional deception			0
" it all has to do with your state of mind and whether or not you had the requisite intent to come up with something that can be considered perjury or ( a ) lie , " @entity5 said			2
the attorney general tried to turn the tables on his @entity3 critics , accusing them of engaging in " inflammatory and inappropriate rhetoric ... in an effort to score political points			1
" it 's time to end " politically motivated ' gotcha ' games , " he said			0
while @entity5 and his critics vehemently disagreed over the extent of executive - legislative cooperation in the @entity9 investigation , they agreed that the deadly fallout from the operation is not over			1
@entity9 is " going to continue to have tragic consequences , " @entity5 said at one point in thursday 's hearing			1
" more people are going to die , probably , " said rep. @entity114 , a @entity115 @entity3			1
" unfortunately , i think that 's probably true , " @entity5 replied			2
last month , @entity5 testified before the @entity118 that the controversial operation " should never have happened , and ... must never happen again , " hitting hard at the @entity121 practice that has now tarnished his tenure at the @entity63			2
despite @entity5 's insistence that @entity8 has never been intentionally misled in the matter , a number of @entity3 have called for him to step down			1
last month , @entity36 rep. @entity126 said the attorney general 's " refusal to take responsibility for the actions of his department is inexcusable			0
" earlier this week , @entity11 , head of the @entity132 , said he is broadening his investigation to also include recent allegations of @entity136 agents laundering money for @entity38 cartels -- accusations that have infuriated officials on both sides of the border			2
" these allegations , if true , raise further unsettling questions about a @entity63 component engaging in a high - risk strategy with scant evidence of success , " @entity11 said in a letter to @entity5			1
" the existence of such a program again calls your leadership into question , " @entity11 added			1
sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , said wednesday that assistant attorney general @entity157 should also resign because he misled @entity8 about his awareness of a february 4 letter that denied any gunrunning operation existed			0
the @entity63 recently withdrew the letter due to inaccurate information , and @entity155 said that e-mails turned over to congressional investigators showed @entity157 saw various versions of the letter -- including the final one submitted to @entity8 -- before it was sent in february			0
in addition , @entity155 said @entity157 knew in 2010 of a previous gunrunning operation by the @entity121 in the @entity171 administration , but he failed to notify superiors or @entity8 about it			2
" mr. @entity157 's failure to be candid and forthcoming before this body irreparably harms his credibility , " @entity155 said , later adding : " mr. @entity157 has lost my confidence in his ability to effectively serve the @entity63			0
if you ca n't be straight with the @entity8 you do n't need to be running the @entity180			0
it is time to stop spinning and start taking responsibility			0
" in response , @entity63 spokeswoman @entity183 said @entity157 " has acknowledged his mistake in not making -- and therefore not alerting department leadership to -- a connection between the allegations made about @entity9 and the unacceptable tactics used years earlier			2
" but @entity5 " continues to have confidence " in @entity157 's ability to lead the department 's @entity180 , @entity183 said			0
@entity157 and @entity5 previously apologized to a @entity19 committee and to @entity155 in particular about the false information in the february letter			0
both have insisted they did not know the assertions were wrong when the department sent the letter			0
however , @entity155 said wednesday that the additional documents recently provided to congressional investigators show that @entity157 should have been aware that the letter contained false assertions , due to his knowledge of a similar previous program called @entity9			1
in @entity38 , the case has drawn nationwide attention and sharp criticism from top officials , who have long stressed that @entity136 weapons are fueling the country 's drug war			0
the @entity38 attorney general 's office demanded a quick @entity136 investigation of the matter in march and said authorities must hold accountable anyone who was responsible for the operation			0
@entity1 's @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity11 compares @entity5 to @entity226 @entity16 ; @entity5 asks @entity11 if he has " no shame "
rep. @entity57 , @entity58 , raises the *prospect* of impeachment
@entity5 says @entity3 critics of @entity9 are trying to " score political points "
