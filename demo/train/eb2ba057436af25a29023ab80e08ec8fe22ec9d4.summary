the source did not know the names of the other four former executives who received subpoenas			2
@entity9 ceo @entity19 spent four hours last thursday testifying at the attorney general 's office about the $ 3.6 billion in bonuses that @entity5 paid out just before it was acquired by the bank last year			1
@entity19 declined to give out details of those payments			0
the @entity0 attorney general 's office served an earlier subpoena on @entity9 during @entity19 ' testimony last week , seeking the full list of individual bonus recipients at @entity5 , according to @entity29 , a special assistant to attorney general @entity6			1
" we obviously wanted to question mr. @entity19 about this list and are very disappointed that @entity9 has chosen not to produce it , " @entity29 said in a written statement			2
" as a result , during the testimony ... we served a subpoena on @entity9 for the list , which we intend to obtain			0
" @entity19 , speaking to reporters as he left the attorney general 's office after his testimony last thursday , said that he had come to " deliver clarity " and that he answered the questions that were asked to the best of his knowledge			1
@entity19 had been criticized for using a corporate jet to travel to the session			0
but @entity9 spokesman @entity47 said on thursday that @entity19 did so " because of the high importance " of the meeting			2
@entity9 has been allocated $ 45 billion in federal bailout funds , and the @entity51 has guaranteed to protect @entity9 against potentially billions of dollars in losses from investments @entity5 made in real estate loans			1
former @entity5 chief executive @entity55 told investigators two weeks ago that @entity19 was aware @entity5 employees would be awarded billions of dollars in bonuses before @entity9 's takeover of @entity5 became effective january 1 , according to sources familiar with the investigation			1
in testimony before the @entity63 on february 11 , @entity19 said he had little involvement in the @entity5 bonus plan			2
" they were a public company until the first of the year , they had a separate board , separate compensation committee and we had no authority to tell them what to do , just urged them what to do , " @entity19 said			0

@entity6 has accused @entity5 of trying to hide lavish bonus payments			0
" @entity5 secretly moved up the planned date to allocate bonuses and then richly rewarded their failed executives , " @entity6 wrote in a letter to @entity63 chairman rep. @entity87 , @entity88			1
@entity6 found @entity5 paid its four top bonus recipients $ 121 million and doled out bonuses of $ 1 million or more to 696 employees , as the firm lost $ 15 billion in the fourth quarter			1
it is not clear how much each of the subpoenaed @entity5 executives received in bonus payments			0
" i do n't want to see the taxpayers being taken advantage of			0
and i do n't want to see the taxpayers paying performance bonuses that should n't be paid , " @entity6 said			0
@entity6 is investigating to see whether failure to disclose the bonus payments to investors violated @entity0 's @entity109 , a powerful securities law that empowers the attorney general to bring not only civil but also criminal charges			1
@entity1 's @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report			0
