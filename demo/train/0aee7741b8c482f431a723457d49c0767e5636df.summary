-- the arrival of autumn in @entity2 will be a welcome relief for international visitors emerging from a bleak winter in the northern hemisphere			2
there 's no mistaking the city of @entity11 -- fine weather means you may struggle to see a cloud in the sky			1
peak season may be winding up but with temperatures off their sticky summer highs it 's a great time to sample one of the country 's most recognizable cities			1
while few international visitors are likely to find themselves stranded in @entity11 for 24 hours ( if only ! ) , here 's our fast - track tour for travelers short on time			1
see the sun come up over @entity28			0
at this time of year , the sun rises at around 6:30am , an hour after the first ferries leave the wharf , so there 's plenty of activity on the water			2
early risers can waste no time in immersing themselves in @entity11 's cultural highlights			1
at 7:00am , the @entity38 hosts tours for just eight people to backstage areas normally off - limits to theatre - goers			1
at $ 100 per person , the two - hour tour is not a budget option but it does include breakfast			2
be warned , the tour includes 300 steps			2
if you 're not exhausted by the machinations of the @entity38 , cool off with a relaxing dip			1
a recent spate of shark attacks may have put you off @entity11 's beaches , but there are plenty of outdoor pools that offer both sun and seawater			1
for serious laps , try the @entity63 ( next to the @entity64 ) or for a lazier affair have a massage at @entity67 in @entity68			0
image gallery : 24 hours in @entity11 Â» once in @entity68 you can admire the @entity2 coastline by following it all the way back to @entity11 's famous @entity73			1
most people start in @entity73 but there 's no reason why you ca n't do it in reverse			1
the two - hour walk takes you past bays and beaches and through the dramatic @entity83 where you can reflect on life while breathing in the views			0
the path ends at the @entity88 surf club where you can grab a cold fizzy beer at the bar or stay for lunch at the bistro			0
the hungry seagulls and pelicans at the @entity96 make lunch there a more interesting affair			1
select your meal from the huge variety of seafood inside the market , grab a bottle of wine and an outdoor table and prepare to guard your chips			1
there is no shortage of up - market alternatives when it comes to dining out in @entity11			1
for one of the best try @entity111 in @entity113			0
it was opened by @entity116 - born @entity115 in 1989 and was lauded in a recent review as " magical dining			0
" it 's only open for lunch on saturdays and you 'd be advised to book well in advance for dinner			2
a cheaper option would be any of the @entity125 ( bring your own ) restaurants dotted around the city			1
most restaurants allow you to bring your own bottle of wine , but they will charge you corkage			0
still , it 's cheaper than the mark - ups on bottles at licensed premises			2

shoppers can pick up a souvenir close by in one of @entity11 's oldest and most beautiful shopping centers , the @entity147			1
the building opened in 1898 , underwent major refurbishment in the 1980s and is now not only a great example of @entity152 architecture but a stunning place to grab a quick coffee			0
( note : the builders are back but the building remains open			0
the new improvements are scheduled to finish in july 2009			0
) in the evening , take a twilight cruise of @entity28 aboard a yacht			0
@entity160 invites everyone for a " fun blast " around the harbor every wednesday evening from 5:30pm to 8:30pm			0
the yacht leaves from the @entity165 in @entity166 , a short hop from the city on the north side of the @entity64			2

" and on october 25 , 20,000 people will have the opportunity to have " @entity180 " ( yes , the @entity64 ) as part of the month - long @entity179 festival			0
check the @entity181 for more			0
in the evening , join the pretty young things at the @entity183 in @entity184 , or take the lift to the fourth floor of the @entity187 where you 'll find the @entity189			0
the loft on @entity191 is also popular , but it has a strict dress code so do n't turn up looking like a traveler or you wo n't get in			0
and finally , there 's no better place to end the night than in one of @entity11 's karaoke bars			1
some allow you to bring your own drinks			0
