-- @entity2 will begin to scale back operations in @entity4 following @entity6 's death , with the preliminary end date of october 31 , @entity2 chief @entity1 said friday			1
a formal decision on a definitive end date will be made early next week			1
" we did what we said we would do and now is the time for the @entity4 people to take their destiny into their own hands , " @entity1 said after meeting with officials in @entity11 to determine what should happen next			0
@entity2 forces will be on standby until the end of the month to continue to provide assistance to civilians if needed , he said , adding that , if requested by the new @entity4 leadership , the international body could also help in the transition with regards to reforms to the country 's defense and security sectors			1
although @entity6 was eventually captured by @entity4 fighters and apparently killed by crossfire , the seven - month - long western intervention through @entity2 was a key factor in his downfall			1
one question is sure to come up : has the @entity4 operation presented a model for future @entity2 missions or has it revealed the organization 's limitations in terms of resources and political will ? new day for @entity4 , but one fraught with challenges within days of the @entity46 's authorization of @entity47 , with the mandate of protecting @entity4 's civilian population , @entity2 forces were engaged in action by air and sea			1
the operation relied on three main prongs -- implementing a no - fly zone , enforcing an arms embargo and taking action to protect civilians and civilian areas under threat of attack			0
since march 31 , some 9,634 strike sorties , where targets are identified or hit , are among 26,000 sorties to have been conducted , @entity2 said friday			1
among the targets were @entity6 's military command centers , armored vehicles , munitions dumps and underground bunkers			1
@entity2 confirmed on friday that 11 @entity71 military vehicles were hit by @entity2 aircraft outside his stronghold of @entity74 thursday morning , after they were seen leaving the city at high speed carrying large amounts of arms and ammunition			1
@entity2 did not know at the time of the strike that @entity6 was in the convoy , which was targeted only because of the threat it posed to civilians , the @entity2 statement said -- but it later learned that @entity6 " was in the convoy and the strike likely contributed to his capture			1
" @entity6 died soon after he was seized by @entity4 fighters			2
@entity93 defense secretary @entity92 said friday that @entity6 's death is proof of the success of the @entity2 alliance and the mission in @entity4			1
" this was not an easy effort , it involved a great deal of cooperation , a great deal of partnership			0
but the fact was that working together , they accomplished this mission that @entity6 is no longer			1
and finally @entity4 belongs to the @entity4 people , " @entity92 said while flying to @entity108 for a series of meetings with @entity93 allies in the region			0
@entity1 similarly hailed the alliance 's @entity4 mission as a " remarkable success , " saying the operation " prevented a massacre and saved countless lives			2
" @entity6 killed in crossfire after capture , @entity120 says @entity93 vice president @entity123 told @entity0 's " @entity126 " program , in an interview to be broadcast sunday , that the operation had shown that the @entity93 did not have to carry the weight of international military interventions alone			1
the point , he said , " is that the @entity2 alliance worked like it was designed to do , burden - sharing			1
in total , it cost us $ 2 billion , no @entity93 lives lost			0
" and unlike other @entity2 operations , such as @entity138 , where the @entity93 has carried " the primary burden , " @entity123 said , " this was really burden - sharing			1
" @entity142 spokesman @entity141 put the price tag for @entity142 operations in @entity4 as of september 30 at $ 1.1 billion			0
this included daily military operations , munitions , the drawdown of supplies and humanitarian assistance			0
@entity151 and @entity152 also committed significant resources to the operation , as did some smaller nations , such as @entity156 , which provided six @entity156 f - 16s in the early months of the mission			2
but those who argue the operation exposed @entity2 's weaknesses point to the larger countries , such as @entity163 and @entity164 , which did not get involved			1
@entity163 abstained from the @entity46 vote on @entity47 , saying it was concerned about a protracted military conflict			0
and despite president @entity169 's determination that the @entity93 take a backseat role in @entity4 , its surveillance drones and air support provision were key			0
in a farewell speech to the @entity2 council in @entity11 in june , former @entity93 defense secretary @entity173 warned that the organization had become a " two - tiered " alliance poorly equipped to deal with challenges			1
criticizing the reluctance of some of the alliance 's 28 members to spend money on defense , he said the @entity4 operation had made it " painfully clear " that shortcomings could " jeopardize the alliance 's ability to conduct an integrated , effective and sustained air - sea campaign			2
" more analysis of @entity2 's performance is bound to come up as the smoke clears			2
@entity2 may also be called to help @entity4 's fledgling government and disparate militias achieve an orderly transition			2
" there are significant security challenges ahead for @entity4 , " @entity197 said			0
" whether that is something @entity2 can help them with , or whether we can help them with , or whether other countries can help them with , we 'll figure that out in the days ahead			2
" but @entity152 foreign minister @entity208 , on @entity209 1 , suggested it was all over			0
" it 's up to the @entity212 to say it as the @entity4 have their fate in the hands today			0
but , i think we can say that the military operation is finished , all of @entity4 's territory is under the control of the @entity212			0
and that , subject to a few transitory measures in the week to come , the @entity2 operation has come to an end			1
" @entity226 , of the @entity228 - based @entity227 think tank , said he expected the @entity2 ambassadors meeting in @entity11 to recognize that @entity2 's military operation in @entity4 was done , but that its involvement in the country was not			1
@entity2 could help the new civilian government in such areas as civilian control of the military , professionalization of security forces and border security , he said , although it might take time before the interim government was in a position to make requests of @entity2			2
and @entity2 can draw some important lessons from the mission , @entity226 said			2
" in many respects this was a successful operation			0
it was an operation in which the @entity93 did play a pretty prominent role , and we even downplayed how much of a role we played			0
" but our @entity209 partners really stepped up to the plate			0
it showed that @entity2 works but it also showed that the alliance is effective in including our @entity256 partners -- in this operation , a key ingredient to success			0
" @entity0 's @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0

" we did what we said we would do , " @entity2 chief says
a decision on a definitive end date will be made next week
@entity2 confirms a strike by its aircraft likely contributed to @entity6 's capture
