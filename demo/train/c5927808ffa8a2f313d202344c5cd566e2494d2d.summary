-- @entity1 has an intense gaze			1
he speaks haltingly , at times pausing , haunted by the memories of the past			1
" i used to try too hard to dress like a girl to impress people , but still they would ask are you a girl or a boy , " he remembers			1
" i used to pray			1
i used to pray to @entity11 to change me			1
he was born female , but identifies more as male			1
@entity11 did n't change him , could n't help with his sexual or gender identity turmoil , but others decided they would			1
" it 's painful because it has been mostly done by my family , " he says softly , staring off into the distance			1
" they wanted to teach me how to behave like a woman			1
" @entity1 was 17 at the time			1
" all the people i ran to were just blaming me			1
i thought maybe my dad would understand , but instead he said ' i have been telling you to behave , to behave like a woman			1
' he was like maybe i deserved whatever i went through , " he says , his voice cracking			2
" that experience made me hate my family			1
it made me leave them , and i went and stayed with my grandmother , but unfortunately she also died , " @entity1 says , dropping his head into his hands			1
his chest heaves , he cries softly			2
" i do n't want to talk about that			2
it 's so hard when the people you expect to be near you are just the people who are hurting you the most			2
" the pain of the memory , of the rejection , the isolation so deep it 's almost too much for him to bear			1
many are leading a double life @entity1 is not his real name			1
like the vast majority of @entity50 's @entity49 community , he leads a secret , double life			1
@entity52 peers warily from behind the slightly cracked gate to her home			2
" people do n't know i live here , " she explains , smiling half - heartedly			2
" i 've been kicked out of so many apartments , this is the longest i have stayed in one place , a year			2
it 's rented in someone else 's name			2
" @entity63 is one of the few gay rights activists who speaks in public in @entity50 , a deeply conservative @entity66 nation that is rabidly homophobic			1
evidence of that is everywhere			2
at @entity71 a few hours earlier , @entity70 archbishop @entity69 praised the country 's @entity72 for passing the anti-homosexuality bill			2
the homosexuals , the lesbians are children of @entity11			2
we want them to repent			2
" he preached to the congregation as it broke out in applause , his voice growing increasingly animated			2
" but to say we accept and then tomorrow you begin to see a man bringing a man			2
can you imagine that ? " @entity63 , like many other members of the @entity49 community , rarely goes to church , and it 's not because she 's lost her faith			1
" for me it 's about love , but now it 's about hate being preached in church , " she explains			1
so she stays away and prays at home			2
@entity63 was just a small child when she received her first beating			2
" my class teacher is the one who told me about the word lesbian			2
it was a big word for me			2
i was 7 years old			2
" since then , she was repeatedly expelled from schools , and worse			2
" i escaped rape thrice			0
i 've been beaten on so many occasions i ca n't remember			0
i think my stubbornness helped me a lot to go through all of this			0
and she 's incredibly lucky			0
her family did n't shun her			1
" my family was there			1
most of my friends became school dropouts because their family would n't support them			1
but , sometimes , i would just sit in my room and cry a lot			0
why am i being told i have demons ? since i was a child i was told i have demons			0
" the widespread belief is that homosexuals are possessed by the devil , or victims of sexual deviance brought in by the @entity125			0
" maybe in your country you understand , " @entity69 lectured us earlier			0
" here it is a new thing , a new idea that is not from here			0
someone is imposing it on us			0
" the irony , gay rights activists say , is that it was a small group of @entity139 evangelicals who came to @entity50 speaking out against homosexuality , which was already illegal , that took the persecutions of the lgbt community to an entirely new level			1
" they said that the gay movement has a blueprint that has reached @entity50 , and if we are not careful we are going to take over the country , " @entity52 recalls			1
but , she says , it did n't stop there			0
" they went to @entity72 and advised them to change the law			0
they went to universities and told students we are recruiting them into homosexuality , that we have a lot of money , that they should be careful , " she says			0
" then they went to parents and told them that we are recruiting their children			0
" legislation drops the death penalty the first draft of the anti-homosexuality bill included the death penalty for " aggravated homosexuality , " defined as homosexual acts with someone who is @entity175 positive , a minor , or repeated homosexual acts with a consenting adult			0
" that was n't the only shock , " @entity52 remembers			0
" the other shock was that some members of @entity72 said the death penalty by hanging was very weak			0
they proposed a firing squad			0
at one point , i posted on my @entity188 page and said maybe i am not really @entity50 , because the @entity50 i have grown up in can not be this cruel			1
even if i have gone through hardships , it ca n't really reach to murder			0
" the bill that just passed through @entity72 drops the death penalty , replacing it with life in prison			0
it also makes anyone who is viewed as a promoter of homosexuality -- like @entity63 -- a criminal who can be jailed			1
" the aim is to protect the institution of marriage and stopping the promotion of homosexuality in our country , " the architect of the bill , @entity72 member @entity202 says			0
if homosexuality were to be eradicated in the process , it would be a good thing , he says			0
" i do n't think that homosexuality is a human right , " he says			0
the bill , which is still waiting presidential sign off , has been heavily criticized by @entity220 governments and international organizations			0
the @entity139 government has responded by saying , " as @entity139 , we believe that people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality -- and that no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or whom they love			0
we join those in @entity50 and around the world who appeal for respect for the human rights of @entity49 persons and of all persons			1
" @entity237 called it " a grave assault on human rights ...			0
it makes a mockery of the @entity50 constitution			1
" the @entity244 said " if signed by the president , this new law would reinforce stigma and prejudice , and institutionalize discrimination			0
" that is already happening			0
@entity63 says she 's received an increasing number of threats , not taken lightly in a community where so many have a horror story of being beaten and abused			0
in recent years , @entity50 tabloids have taken to " outing " homosexuals			1
in 2011 , after being named in a popular paper under a banner that read " hang them , " @entity260 was bludgeoned to death			0
activists called it a blatant hate crime			1
" i would condemn him , " @entity260 's mother says , saying she did n't know he was gay until he was murdered			1
" i would hate him , but i would counsel him			1
" despite that view , she 's stigmatized by society because of her son 's sexuality			1
' our movement needs a face ' @entity63 says she would rather go to jail than be driven out of her own country			0
" i am not going to allow someone to push me out without a fight , " she says			0
" the other thing is our movement needs a face			0
i do n't want them to think they have won because the battle is just starting now			0
" it 's not that i want just to stay here to be a hero			0
i want to stay here because my family is here			1
i want to stay here to visit my mom 's grave			0
" so many just want to be accepted for who they are -- by their nation and by their families -- no matter their sexuality			0
even @entity1 , despite what he 's been through			1
" i hate him , " he says of his father			1
" he only wants to talk to me when he wants money			0
sometimes i give it to him , when i have			0
i do n't know where i get that mercy of giving him money			0
" and @entity1 is adamant that he is going to confront his father			1
" i want to tell him to accept me , but he needs to accept me not as a daughter , but as a son			1
" @entity139 , @entity314 slam @entity50 's anti-gay bill @entity50 official : homosexuality a threat			1

@entity1 , who is transgender , say most pain was inflicted by his family
@entity49 activist says she *'d* rather be jailed than forced out of @entity50
" i would condemn him . i would hate him , but i would counsel him , " mother says of gay son
