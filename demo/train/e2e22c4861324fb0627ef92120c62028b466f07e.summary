-- the sense that a deadly tragedy could get worse hangs over the crash site of @entity4 17			1
scattered bodies , ripped - apart suitcases and charred books testify that 298 people died thursday when the airplane fell from 30,000 feet to the grassy fields of an almost - lawless section of eastern @entity12			1
more than 24 hours after the crash , the bodies lay there untouched , with nobody able to say who 's in charge and whether the dead would ever be treated with dignity			1
" it basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now , guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable , " @entity21 , spokesman for the @entity23 team , told @entity0 's @entity24			2
the bodies are starting to decompose in the @entity12 summer heat , the stink mixing with the charred odor coming from the wreckage			1
surrealistic signs of death carpet the countryside			1
some on the @entity4 - bound plane were dressed in sandals , shorts and other clothes people wear on a tropical vacation , said @entity47 , a freelance journalist who visited the crash site			1
at one spot he noticed a printout of the top 10 tourist tips for people visiting @entity53			1
some passengers , he said , died strapped into their seats wearing headphones , as if listening to music or watching an onboard movie			2
emergency workers say they 've found more than 170 bodies across a wide area , some caught up in large pieces of the aircraft , others simply lying where they fell			2
some bodies are mangled so much it 's impossible to say if they 're man or woman , others show no marks or injury			2
in the darkness , it 's not hard to stumble across a body			0
the region is controlled by pro-russian militants , who gave a rude reception friday to monitors on the @entity23 team			2
they were in the region to observe the war and are n't air crash investigators			2
" we asked for the commander , the leader , " @entity21 told @entity24			0
" no one showed up			0
" there was one gentleman there in a uniform , heavily armed , and apparently somewhat intoxicated who was n't very hospitable or helpful at all			1
in fact in the end he kind of rushed all of them away , including the journalists			0
" @entity21 said the team spent only 75 minutes at the crash site and examined only a 200 - meter strip before being chased away			1
in the distance , he heard explosions , a familiar sound in this region ripped apart by war			0
" the perimeter is not secure whatsoever , " @entity21 said			0
" they seemed to have put some tape up where we were standing , but otherwise it 's very easy for anyone , really , to walk in there and tamper with evidence or debris			0
so a lot of work needs to be done			0
a lot of professional work , very , very quickly			0
" in the @entity121 or other @entity123 nations , law enforcement would have put the crash site off limits to the morbidly curious right away			1
in east @entity12 , reporters walked right up to pieces of wreckage to do stand - up reports			1
a small crew of emergency workers from the @entity12 government arrived and began working on the scene , but they need more people and resources to properly handle a crash that killed 298 people			1
they 're obviously working with the permission of the militants			2
at night the groups mingled , seemingly without hostility , and even shared tents			0
meanwhile , the world is watching			0
" it is cool right now , " @entity21 said , " but if it 's a warm day tomorrow , it will continue to turn into quite a messy situation			0
" @entity149 of @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
