@entity0 -- he was known only as @entity3 -- a little boy at the center of a international custody fight that went all the way to the @entity9 @entity8			1
the near decade - long dispute has now come to an end , not because of any judicial action , but simply because of time			0
@entity14 turned 16 recently and has officially " aged out " of coverage under @entity16 dealing with child abduction across borders			2
a @entity9 federal judge this week signed an order dismissing the case between the boy 's parents			1
mother and son now live in @entity26			0
she says the youngster seeks no further contact with his father			0
@entity30 said she was shocked when she heard the news monday , never quite sure her case would ever be resolved			2
" @entity14 is safe and his own country , that 's the most important thing , " she told @entity1 from her office in @entity34			0
" we 're whole , we 're here , we 're safe			0
" the @entity8 in 2010 ruled the @entity41 father could continue his federal appeals in his effort to regain custody of his son , who was taken by his mother from @entity47 to @entity26 despite a @entity47 court 's decree prohibiting either parent from taking the child out of the country without consent from the other			1
the judicial appeal tested the power of federal courts to intervene when fights over children go global , and tackled the issue of the scope of international treaty , and whether one country 's court order preventing a child from being taken overseas by a parent represented a " right of custody " enforceable in the @entity9			1
the justices , by a 6 - 3 vote , said @entity71 had such a right of custody and could force the boy 's return to @entity47 , even though courts in that @entity78 nation had said that despite the earlier decree , the father enjoyed only limited power as a non-custodial parent			1
the case was tossed back to the lower federal courts			1
during one recent hearing , the boy told a federal judge why he did not want to live with or see his father			2
there was no immediate reaction from @entity71 's @entity0 attorney to the judge 's final order of dismissal			0
this custody fight involved a broad mix of nations and nationalities			2
the father is a @entity41 citizen and his estranged wife is an @entity78			0
they married in @entity102 and their son , born in @entity104 in 1995 , is a @entity9 citizen			1
the family subsequently moved to @entity47 , and the couple separated in march 2003			1
the mother was later awarded custody of the boy , while the father was granted visitation rights			1
it was at that point that the @entity47 courts issued a decree prohibiting either party from removing the child from the country without mutual consent			1
but @entity120 did just that , taking the then - 10 - year - old boy amid a fight over visitation by the father			2
she claimed that due to visa restrictions in @entity47 , she could not find work or rent an apartment			1
@entity71 then hired a private investigator who eventually located the child in @entity131 , @entity26			0
@entity14 next went to federal court , asking that his son -- known in court papers as " @entity3 " -- be returned to @entity47 under provisions enforceable by international law			1
the @entity16 on the @entity138 grants parents in general a " right of custody " and a separate " right of access , " ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others			2
more than 80 countries are a party to the treaty , including the @entity9 and @entity47			1
a federal appeals court in @entity148 concluded the father had only visitation rights , not formal " custody , care and control			1
" it said he could not claim a " right of custody " under @entity155			2
the judges noted , however , that he had a " right of access , " allowing him to see the child in the @entity9			1
but the @entity9 @entity8 later voided that ruling			2
" to interpret the convention to permit an abducting parent to avoid a return remedy , even when the other parent holds a ne exeat ( custodial ) right , would run counter to the convention 's purpose of deterring child abductions by parents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding custodial disputes , " justice @entity162 said			0
in dissent , justice @entity174 said the father 's rights were necessarily limited , and he lacked the ultimate power to say where the boy should live			2
under the justice 's reading of the convention , the father had authority only " to seek assistance from this country in carrying out the @entity47 family court 's visitation order			2
" but the now - retired @entity174 accurately predicted the @entity14 child could , under @entity26 law , eventually have a vital role in deciding where he would live			0
" so no matter what we do , the child may actually provide the answer to this case , " he said when the case was argued two years ago			0
the @entity14 case has been cited in other similar custody disputes involving the @entity9 , @entity201 , and @entity202			1
@entity120 expressed frustration that her estranged husband used an international treaty and the federal courts to try to thwart earlier @entity47 court decisions			1
" my husband had threatened that he would do anything to leave me with nothing , including my child , despite the fact the ( @entity47 ) courts had granted me full custody			1
so he tried to drag this out for as long as he could			0
and my son has been waiting for years for strangers to decide his future			0
the ( @entity220 ) treaty leaves too much room for abuse by a vengeful parent			0
" @entity120 has tried without success to get a divorce from her husband , who has long objected			0
she said her son has adjusted surprisingly well to all the personal turmoil in his young life			0
" he 's very relieved when i told him last night about the court order , " she said			0
" he just smiled and said , ' that 's very good news , indeed			0
' " the @entity8 case was @entity14 v. @entity71 ( 08 - 645 ) .			0

a case involving an international treaty and parental custody rights is closed
courts in @entity47 and the @entity9 had issued different rulings in the case
the *question* is left *unresolved* when the boy at the center of the case turns 16
