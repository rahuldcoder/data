editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- on january 22 , 2006 , the @entity20 reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from @entity23 's tribal areas , which has been called " the most dangerous place in the world			1
" a week before that , the @entity26 fired missiles remotely from a @entity30 aircraft into the @entity32 tribal area			1
they were hoping to eradicate a bunch of @entity36 operatives			0
instead , they killed 18 women and children			0
one week before that , i arrived in @entity23 to visit @entity42 , the massive open - air market located deep in the tribal areas , where a frighteningly high percentage of @entity47 holy warriors goes to buy their guns			1
gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible			1
it took months of pre-planning with the consul general of @entity23 in @entity53 and top officials in @entity55			1
they repeatedly denied us entry because , according to them , the @entity59 had too many " sensitive operations " going on in that region			0
without my personal advantage ( a family friendship with the governor of the @entity65 ) , we never would have gotten in			0
the government assigned me and my team a political agent named @entity69			0
he was born and raised in the tribal areas			2
he took care of us while we were there , and he was a godsend			0
you ca n't do anything in this part of the world without someone like @entity69			0
see more stories on @entity9 our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center , where we were introduced to the @entity84 militia , six angry - dad - looking guys with aks and sidearms			1
they became our personal bodyguards , and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories , barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day			1
most of the work is done by hand			2
the vendors are pashtuns , who are basically the toughest people in the world			0
they comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the @entity106 out of @entity107 in the late ' 80s			1
these days , the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the @entity109			2
they purchase the guns , then cross the border to fight the @entity114 army in @entity107 , or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the @entity23 army			1
this summer , i went back to @entity23 , and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter			2
the @entity23 army has surged more troops into the tribal areas , attempting to eradicate the @entity109 and @entity36			1
the @entity114 and @entity124 troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in @entity107			1
meanwhile , @entity23 itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers , where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations			2
but at the same time , there is a cultural explosion taking place , a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere			0
the whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government			0
for @entity23 , it 's a volatile , turbulent , and fascinating moment in time .			2

@entity9 gains rare access to gun market in @entity23 tribal area
massive shop manufactures up to 1,000 guns a day , most by hand
area has been home base for the @entity109 since the @entity114 *invasion* of @entity107
