-- the legend of @entity2 is a more than century - old story handed down from generation to generation of disenfranchised @entity6			1
widely known as the @entity7 of @entity6 , @entity2 was said to be the quintessential son of the pueblo			1
his story was embraced by the poor and , more recently , by drug traffickers			1
they worship the folk hero as a type of secular saint			1
@entity2 's name has become so inextricably linked with drug trafficking that busts and other paraphernalia of him have been used as evidence against defendants in drug trials			1
for @entity26 hip - hop star @entity25 , that presents some problems			1
as a musician he performs under the stage name " @entity2			1
" since he can remember , he 's crafted his image after his boyhood hero			2
a photo on one of his social media sites shows just how much			2
in one picture , @entity25 is dressed in a traditional white @entity6 button - up , his usual beard shaved into a thin mustache , a strikingly similar pose to how @entity2 is portrayed			1
the musician has also embraced activism , taking the side of the disenfranchised , something he says @entity2 would have done			1
if that was n't enough , he even introduces himself to people as " @entity2			1
" @entity25 says he was fascinated with the mystical folklore and was not aware of the negative perception of @entity2			1
but as drug violence plagues parts of @entity6 , the stigma has forced the musician to reconsider what he 's created for himself			1
" it 's crazy , i get messages and e-mails from people who think i 'm really him , " @entity25 said in an interview at the @entity56 conference in @entity57			2
watch @entity25 music video the messages come sporadically on his social media pages , he said			2
and because he lives with a tainted name , some of the messages are threats			0
" i get people that hit me up , " he said about the threats , " but once they realize what i 'm about they 're cool , " he said without elaborating			0
@entity76 , creator of @entity77 , which helps train @entity79 law enforcement staff about religious practices , said the cartels embraced figures like @entity2 because they " hear prayers from dark places -- prayers traditional deities like the @entity86 do n't			1
" a shrine dedicated to @entity2 is located in @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity6			1
it is believed thousands visit it every year to give offerings to the " narco saint			2
" people leave messages pleading for miracles			0
when they believe those miracles materialize , they return with more offerings			0
@entity76 spent more than 20 years writing about deviant religious groups , researching @entity102 communities and healers in @entity104			0
he said in the 1980s , he began seeing @entity106 imagery in @entity6			1
he saw images of @entity108 , the protector of death			0
later , he saw @entity108 's image tied to one figure who kept coming up			0
unlike traditional @entity115 , there is no hard and fast ritual to worshipping figures like @entity2 or @entity108 , @entity76 said			1
that made those figures spiritually attractive to nefarious people , including drug traffickers			1
so , the folk hero became inextricably linked with a dark business			0
@entity25 chose the name innocently			2
the son of a @entity6 immigrant grape picker , he spent childhood summers running through the grapevines of @entity130 's @entity129 , side by side with his mother while she worked			1
being first - generation @entity134 he kept close ties to his culture , listening intently to the stories his grandfather told him growing up			2
the story about @entity2 caught his attention			1
for the young @entity25 , sharing the first name with a railroad bandito legend was " pretty cool , " but what appealed to him more were the stories of @entity2 's philanthropy and how he made his legend by helping the poor hard - working families in the western state of @entity89 , @entity6			1
unlike his contemporary -- the more politically minded legendary @entity6 hero @entity151 -- there is no proof @entity2 existed			1
those who perpetuate the legend speak of a man who was the " son of the pueblo " during the turn of the 20th century			0
@entity6 authorities were said to have hunted the elusive @entity2 relentlessly and then offered a sizeable reward for his capture -- dead or alive			1
as the legend goes , @entity2 told his friend to kill him , turn his body in and give the reward money to the people of @entity89			1
in the years after his purported death in 1909 , and as his legend was repeated over time by poor @entity6 farm workers , those who paid homage to @entity2 grew in numbers			1
with the rise of drug culture in rural @entity89 between the 1970s and ' 80s , @entity2 's image morphed into something less benevolent			1
" there 's a seriousness involved to the name i chose , " @entity25 said			2
" but he defended his decision with the argument that @entity2 's legend had nothing to do with narco - trafficking			1
then , he paused , understanding the sensitivity of what he just said			0
" it 's not like i 'm out there saying stupid stuff			0
the bandito music is about love and the street and the struggle , " @entity2 said , referring to " bandit music , " which glamorizes illegitimate lifestyles and is seen by its critics as praising thug life			1
" my music has a moral to it			0
when i started 10 - plus years or so ago , the stigma was n't as bad as it is now			2
i 'm not redefining the brand because it is what it is			0
it 's others ( who ) have redefined it and made it something else			0
" @entity25 entered high school in @entity130 , where he also went to college			0
he began writing poetry , listening to hip - hop and attending pro-immigration rallies			1
at political functions , he contributed through spoken word poetry			0
it turned into rap and from there he started writing music			0
he was good and was soon signed by @entity223 as a recording artist			0
" eventually i got to a point where people were like , you need a name , " he said			0
almost instinctively , he chose the name @entity2			1
on a serendipitous day , he was talking to his producer about whether he should go with the name when a @entity6 healer on the streets of @entity57 handed his producer a card			1
on it was the image of @entity2 with the @entity86 behind him			1
" that was my green light , " @entity25 said			0
" i believe in signs			0
i went to catholic school first through fifth grade , " @entity25 said , laughing on the phone while at a studio in @entity57			0
just to be sure he was n't making a mistake , he met with the healer			0
she gave him her blessing			0
he did not foresee the dark drug cloud that hung over him			2
former @entity79 ambassador to @entity6 @entity248 said it was the outlaw spirit of @entity2 's image that appeals to the narcos			1
" @entity252 being a mytho - secular saint probably had plenty to do with these guys looking for a talisman of sorts for today and a guide into the here - and ever - after tomorrow , " @entity248 said			1
@entity76 , the @entity258 consultant , said the cartels chose figures like @entity2 to make them scapegoats through demonization			1
" it was the process of the cartels attaching themselves to the @entity2 image that is shocking and anti-traditional and now it has taken a life of its own , " @entity76 said			2
@entity25 said the drug traffickers feel they are emulating the legacy of @entity2			1
" and in a way they are , " he said			0
" but then there 's the other aspect			0
it 's tragic in that sense that it 's taken such a negative , nasty turn			0
" beyond the more than 100 @entity280 search results on the narco culture ties to @entity2 , @entity25 said anyone can find the real legend of the folklore hero			2
it is his struggle , he said , to shed the misconceptions of @entity2 created over time			2
" i 'm involved in major nonprofits and community education			0
and they see someone in me who has overcome being in the barrio			0
to me , that 's @entity2			2
the experience of instilling that hope			0
if @entity2 was alive right now , i try to think what would he be doing ? " but carrying the " @entity2 cross " became so burdensome that @entity25 subconsciously turned away from the name altogether			2
a year ago he stopped playing music under his stage name and left @entity223 , choosing to focus instead on a collaboration he calls the @entity301 , an eclectic mix of @entity304 language politically driven hip - hop			1
the whole time , though , @entity25 said he looked for signs to perform again under the name @entity2			2
" here 's a man , whether he existed or not , 100 years later still has such an impact , " he said , referencing the popular @entity6 ballads known as corridos			2
like my grandfather says , you leave a good ' corrido '			0
and my music is my ' corrido '			0
it 's the power of the word			0
" @entity25 knows the gravity of the name he adopted			0
people have gotten killed for less , he said			0
but @entity2 , he said , will always exist in him			2
and , he said , " he exists in you			0
