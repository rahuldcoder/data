@entity2 gets constituent pushback over ' inner city ' comments @entity2 's ' inner city ' comments spark backlash but wednesday 's session on @entity21 did n't bridge the gulf between @entity2 's philosophy of addressing poverty and that of the black caucus - whose members defend many of the current federal anti-poverty programs that @entity2 's proposed budget would cut			1
the black caucus chair , rep. @entity31 , an @entity33 @entity32 , stood next to @entity2 after the closed - door meeting and thanked him for coming			1
but then she said bluntly that the meeting " did n't get a whole lot accomplished			0
" she said while the black caucus and @entity2 both are concerned about poverty , " we just disagree on how we address the problem			2
" controversial remarks @entity2 opened the meeting explaining his comments a few weeks ago on a radio program - which triggered the invitation to sit down with the group -- did n't come out the way he intended , according to a @entity32 who attended the session			1
during a march interview with conservative commentator @entity50 , @entity2 , who has been working on alternative ways to address poverty , said there is a " tailspin of culture , in our inner cities in particular , of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work			2
" many @entity66 - @entity65 leaders called the comments racially charged and the blowback prompted @entity2 to swiftly admit his remarks were " inarticulate			1
" @entity70 referenced the controversy to reporters			0
" there was some concern about comments that have been made about the culture in which we find this poverty , but we have agreed today that it is across the board			2
there is no particular place or people who experience poverty at a different rate than others , " she said			0
did n't say sorry democrats who attended the meeting said @entity2 did n't say sorry , and was n't asked for an apology			2
he told members that sometimes what he 's thinking in his head does n't come across the way he wants and admitted that in the debate going forward , he needed to do a better job at explaining his position			2
rep. @entity98 , @entity99 , characterized @entity2 's presentation as trying " to walk back " what he said , but she said there are still some black caucus members who believe @entity2 was expressing his true feelings			1
@entity98 told reporters she thinks the meeting helped open a door to continued dialogue			0
@entity2 explained after the meeting " the point i 've been making all along is that we are marginalizing and isolating the poor in our communities and we need to stop doing that as a country			0
" @entity2 , the 2012 @entity6 vice presidential candidate and a potential @entity115 hopeful next time around , argued " the status quo does n't work " and said the point of the session with the black caucus was to improve " the tone of the debate so that more people are invited to this debate			0
" challenged on his budget but @entity2 also acknowledged that major differences on " macroeconomics and budgets " still existed			0
rep. @entity128 , a @entity32 from @entity129 and the top ranking @entity66 in the @entity115 , said he believed @entity2 was sincere , but pointed to his proposed budget and said flatly " if he stands by his resolution than he ca n't be serious about the discussion we had today			2
" @entity3 members challenged @entity2 about the more than $ 900 billion in cuts to discretionary programs in his budget , saying they did n't mesh with his stated commitment to helping the poor , pointing specifically to his effort to repeal @entity141 and target social welfare programs in his proposal			1
according to @entity98 , @entity2 " punted , saying it was members on the @entity146 who get to decide which federal programs would actually see cuts			0
" @entity2 's work on poverty issues dates to the 1990s when he was an aide to the late @entity6 vice presidential candidate @entity150 , who headed a policy group called " @entity152			1
" @entity150 visited poor neighborhoods and pushed proposals to earmark federal and private resources to " empowerment zones " to lift people out of poverty			0
over the past year , @entity2 has traveled to a dozen communities around the @entity65 to learn about efforts to reduce poverty and promote more economic opportunity through mostly charitable organizations			1
