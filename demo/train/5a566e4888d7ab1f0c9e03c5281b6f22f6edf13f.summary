-- @entity2 medical groups joined the @entity4 health ministry friday in recommending that women seek removal of breast implants made by a @entity4 company , saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems			1
@entity12 's @entity11 also weighed in friday , stopping short of recommending routine removal of implants made by @entity15 , or @entity16 , but agreeing to pay to have them taken out in some cases			1
@entity4 authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company 's implants , which a @entity25 medical group says were made from " non-medical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses			1
" authorities in @entity4 and @entity12 have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants , but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation , scarring and fibrosis			1
more than 500 @entity4 women have had the implants removed since last year , according to the @entity4 government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products			2
since then , more than 1,000 implants have ruptured , the agency said			0
@entity2 medical groups representing plastic surgeons , breast care specialists and gynecologists said friday that while the implants do not pose any immediate health threat , they raise the risk of ruptures , difficulties with breast imaging and other complications			1
" we recommend removal without hurry , just as the @entity4 expert commission has recommended , " the groups said in a joint release			2
in @entity25 , @entity59 , chief executive of the @entity11 , said an advisory medical group found there was no evidence to support routine removal of the implants or suggestions that they could increase the risk of cancer			1
" however , the group also acknowledges that many of the implants are made up of non-medical grade silicone and should not have been implanted in women in the first place , " @entity59 said in a letter to medical workers released friday			0
@entity59 said the government would pay to have the implants removed from women who received them as part of reconstructive care provided by the publicly funded @entity11			2
women who paid for cosmetic implants from private clinics would not be eligible for government funded care in most cases , the @entity11 said			0
but @entity59 said he hoped private practitioners would also pay for the removal of implants if patients request it			0
" we want the private sector to offer the same service to its patients as the @entity11 is offering and we are working with them to best ensure an equivalent model of care is provided , " he said			0
an estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company			1
