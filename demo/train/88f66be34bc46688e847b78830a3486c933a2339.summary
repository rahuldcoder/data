hardcore @entity2 football " ultra " @entity0 is a @entity4 supporter who happily admits directing monkey chants at black players			1
it is " a means to distract opposition players " says @entity0 , a member of the @entity10 ( " @entity11 " ) group which follows the @entity14 - based team			1
" i am against anyone who calls me a @entity21 , " @entity0 told academic @entity15 , who spent time " embedded " with @entity4 and @entity17 ultras for the book " @entity19 : the @entity22 , " co-authored by @entity23			1
" what i do not like is people who come to my country and commit crimes ; @entity28 and @entity29 are destroying @entity14 with their camps , " @entity0 adds			0
" but i 'm not a racist			1
one day , i was waiting in my car at the traffic lights and , as usual , there was a young female gypsy who was trying to clean the car windscreen and was asking for money			0
" suddenly municipal police officers started to mistreat the girl			0
i jumped out of my car and almost kicked his arse			0
" there is nothing black and white about @entity2 football			1
racist abuse has provided the backdrop to the @entity49 season , with the latest incident -- not for the first time -- involving @entity53 striker @entity52 , who was targeted by visiting @entity17 fans throughout a match at the @entity56 in may			1
in the second half referee @entity57 called the game to a halt for a few minutes , having warned the crowd via the public address system			0
days after his return to @entity49 earlier in 2013 , following his move from @entity64 to @entity53 , @entity2 - born @entity52 was referred to by his new club 's vice president @entity65 -- the younger brother of the team 's owner and the former @entity2 prime minister , @entity69 -- as " the family 's little black boy			1
" that remark came after , in what appeared to be an innocuous friendly match against fourth tier @entity2 side @entity76 last month , @entity53 midfielder @entity72 picked up the ball and kicked it into the stands before tearing off his black - and - red striped shirt and walking off in protest at the persistent monkey chanting to which he and three of his black teammates had been subjected			1
in the aftermath of @entity72 's walkout , @entity2 interior minister @entity86 told @entity89 that if only a small group of fans were involved in racist chanting , games should not be suspended , but if " a significant part of the fans take part " the game should be stopped " by those responsible for public order			1
" as @entity2 grapples with how best to confront racism , it is worth remembering it 's not the only country working out a solution as to how to deal with the problem			1
neo-nazis and @entity107 this season , matches across @entity110 have been punctuated by repeated racist outbursts , which have led to calls for world governing body @entity113 and @entity110 counterpart @entity114 to show greater leadership and impose harsher sanctions			2
amid the monkey chants and racial stereotyping , there are no easy answers to the question of just how prevalent is the incidence of racist abuse in @entity2 football			1
according to the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) in feburary , there have been 50 incidents in @entity2 of racist abuse over the last six years			1
of those 50 cases , 48 relate to racist chanting , with two relating to abusive banners			2
" and the total of violent episodes diminished from 209 to 60 and the majority of them happened outside the football venues , " @entity127 spokesman @entity132 told @entity133			2
" the introduction of stewarding has also reduced the need of intervention by police officers inside the venues significantly			0
" however , talk to the head of @entity2 's @entity146 in @entity19 , @entity147 , who has been monitoring racism in @entity2 football for over a decade , and a different picture emerges			1
his organization estimates there have been over 660 racial incidents since 2000 and puts the number since 2007 at 282 , nearly six times as much as the @entity127 figure			1
in all , fines of $ 5 million have been handed out as punishment in those 660 - plus cases , equating to a fine of $ 7,500 per incident			0
" the numbers i record relate to the decision that the judge takes in the sports court and lays down fines and any disqualifications			0
the @entity127 figures concern the criminal law , " said @entity147			2
" so in the @entity72 case the sports court ruled that @entity76 had to play the game ... ' behind closed doors ' and were fined $ 6,689			0
" but the ordinary court -- the criminal law -- has instead decided that those songs were not racist			2
for me it 's racism , for the @entity181 , no. " @entity147 added : " in @entity2 , no club has a real anti-racist strategy , because it believes the fight against racism is not a priority			1
" since the early 1990s , many curves of the stadium have been occupied by neo-nazi and @entity107 groups , but this problem has been addressed only as a problem of public order			2
" that is a view that is supported by @entity2 football writer @entity195 , a fan of @entity196 , who added : " the ultra still , and always will hold all the power at clubs			1
they choose what is sung , what everyone does and how they do it			0
" stewards and police hardly ever enter the curve as they would most likely get beaten up			0
ultras say if the authorities stay out the curve , there wo n't be any problems			2
almost all trouble happens outside the ground anyway , so that 's where police tend to hang around			0
" time warp while @entity72 walked off , former @entity220 international @entity219 , who played for both @entity53 and @entity221 as well as @entity222 , said he felt it was important to show that racist abuse did not affect him as a player during the many years of his career he spent in @entity2			1
" you would have a problem in certain areas , " @entity219 told @entity133			0
" but you are a professional , you have an obligation to your team			0
my opinion was i 'm a professional and the smartest way is to play so good that you make them even angrier			0
" it is also about ignorance , a fear of the unknown			0
if you are interested in different cultures , it 's normal			0
" if you 're not , you do n't understand that concept			0
it is not only in @entity2 and it is not the whole of @entity2			1
it was only certain teams you played , but 80 - 90 % i did n't have a problem in @entity2 , " added @entity219 , though @entity147 's analysis suggests the problem is much more widespread			1
if football , race and politics make for a combustible mix in @entity2 , it is also arguable that the standard of the country 's stadia is not helping			1
while @entity262 football was forced to grapple with extensive stadium renovation to improve facilities for fans due to recommendations made by @entity267 after the deadly crowd disasters at @entity269 and @entity270 in the 1980s , @entity2 football was left in a time warp			1
" i really do n't believe that @entity2 football has learned the lessons of @entity270 and @entity269 , or at least has n't implemented any tangible changes at anything like the pace required , " said another @entity2 football writer @entity272			1
" while the @entity267 report and formation of the @entity279 put @entity262 football at the forefront of fan safety and gave it ultra-modern stadia almost throughout the league , @entity49 still plays host to a number of ancient , decrepit grounds			1
" many are still those built for @entity288 with places such as @entity196 's @entity290 and the @entity291 in @entity292 particularly poor on both counts			0
" the problems extend to a lack of quality stewarding and lax ticket security while the ultras bring even greater problems to the situation			0
" @entity301 , who is writing a book about @entity2 football stadia -- " stadio : the @entity306 of @entity307 " -- concurs that the lack of stadium redevelopment has held back @entity2 football			1
of @entity49 's big clubs , only @entity222 has built a new stadium , he notes			2
" the modernity of the stadia is the central issue to declining attendances -- families do not want to sit in the cold , unfriendly surroundings , " said @entity301			2
" in my opinion the league needs to harness to new stadiums to help maximize @entity49 's re-emergence			0
" so what 's the solution ? " the @entity127 makes a relevant anti-racism activity both in the national and international domain according to the @entity114 policy and guidelines , and is member of anti-discrimination organization @entity329 , " said the @entity127 in its statement to @entity133			2
" specific guidelines are part of @entity333 's requirements , as are the anti-racism initiatives that are made through @entity335 to involve 860,000 young footballers			2
" but as @entity2 historian @entity337 , author of the authoritative book on @entity2 football " @entity307 " points out : " the @entity2 authorities have been all over the place on racism for a long time			1
" racist chants @entity147 , meanwhile , urged the @entity127 to donate the racism fines it recoups from the clubs for initiatives against racism , as does @entity114 in its work with @entity329			1
" any solution has to revolve around the football authorities , " added professor @entity348 , who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice			1
@entity355 calls on @entity113 and @entity114 to do more			0
" the @entity127 , @entity113 and @entity114 must empower fan - based initiatives that are capable of creating a culture of self - regulation			2
the anti-racism agenda has come a long way in the last decades			2
" by walking off @entity72 and his fellow players have forced the agenda			0
the high - level political support for his action now means this might happen again , but this time during a much higher profile game -- perhaps even in the @entity368			2
the authorities have to react to this potential			0
" but @entity355 also warned against an indiscriminate reaction by the authorities			0
" we have learned a great deal about crowd management since the heysel disaster , and there must be recognition that it is not appropriate or constructive to sanction whole crowds , " he said			0
" the approach to security must be capable of differentiating between those fans that are acting illegally and those fans that are not			0
failure to recognize this and to react indiscriminately runs a very real danger of escalating not reducing the problems			0
