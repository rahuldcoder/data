@entity0 has delivered his verdict on his time in the @entity3 -- he could n't be happier to have left @entity4			1
the @entity6 international , who quit @entity7 for @entity8 last january , endured a tumultuous two - year spell in @entity4 with his life being played out on television screens and splashed across the pages of the tabloid newspapers			1
car crashes , throwing a dart at a youth team player , fireworks being set off in his bathroom and a training ground bust - up with the manager were all par for the course for football 's " enfant terrible " during his time at @entity7			2
the 22 - year - old , who describes himself as just a " normal guy , " insists his treatment at the hands of the @entity31 press crossed a line			1
" yes , " @entity0 told @entity33 when asked if he was unfairly treated in @entity4			1
" but i 'm not here to talk about if i 'm unfairly treated			0
i 'm out from @entity4 , i 'm happy that i 'm out from @entity4			1
" i 'm really happy now			0
i have my family near me and my friends			0
i can relax and find my privacy , more than in @entity4 , where i was alone			2
" despite the off - field misdemeanors , former manager @entity40 constantly defended the player even though @entity0 's behavior tested a relationship which stretched back to when the @entity6 - born forward was a raw and talented 16 - year - old at @entity47			1
however , the deterioration in the pair 's relationship led to the striker being sold by @entity7 for $ 30 million to @entity8			0
@entity40 was relieved of his duties only last week following a season in which @entity7 failed to win a trophy			0
back in @entity55 , @entity0 still attracts headlines , although he insists not all of the extraordinary incidents he has been linked with are factually correct			1
@entity59 became a minefield of rumor and speculation with tales of @entity0 driving around @entity64 , throwing money at homeless people -- just one of the untrue stories to have been concocted			1
" the stuff that they said in the newspapers that i did in @entity4 in the past , few of those are real , " he said			2
" the others are really just the imagination of the journalists			0
but when you create an icon of a person in that kind of way , after everyone thinks you are like this and if you lie about it , everyone just thinks that it is all true			0
" so maybe that 's why they think i 'm crazy and do crazy things ? sometimes i dream to be alone and that nobody would talk to me			0
" a love of women i think is normal			1
cars ? i like fast cars and i do n't see the problem if i like fast cars			1
" some things have happened in my life , some stuff unfortunately happened and they went on the newspapers straight away			0
but i do n't see anything that would make people think that i 'm bad or i 'm crazy			0
i 'm a normal guy			1
" but i understand that football is really important and that everybody watches it			0
when you 're famous you have to do photos or autographs , especially for the kids			0
" back in @entity55 with his friends and family , @entity0 feels more comfortable and able to live freely in a way he found difficult to do so in @entity4			1
but he admits that his past transgressions count against him and that general public has preconceived notions about his personality			0
" of course , even if you 're the best in the world then some people do n't like you and some people like you , " added @entity0			1
" what is important for me is that the people who know me for real , know @entity0 how he really is			2
" people who do n't know me , they read newspapers and they watch tv			0
television is made to give a lot of opinions , so i ca n't show the real @entity0 to everybody			2
" since joining @entity8 , @entity0 has scored 11 goals in 12 games .			2
