@entity0 -- lions may be kings of the jungle , but for nearly two hours , two kittens ruled the concrete jungle as officials halted @entity0 subway service thursday			1
the fearless felines risked all nine lives meandering the subway thursday , causing part of it to be shut down for 90 minutes as personnel cut the power to begin their search			2
the @entity18 suspended subway service on the @entity20 lines between the @entity21 and @entity22 stops in @entity23 -- about 6 miles of track -- to search for two cats that were reported seen at about 11 a.m. , @entity18 spokesman @entity17 said			1
@entity18 had to cut the power to the third rail , which carries 600 volts of electricity			1
" if you touch that third rail , you 're not going to make it -- people and especially cats , anything that moves , " @entity17 said			2
@entity0 are accustomed to seeing critters , but it 's usually rats and mice scampering around the underground tunnels , leaving the alley cats above ground			2
even though the search was for a couple of friendly felines , some riders were not happy with the inconvenient suspension			1
" it 's a waste of money			2
they could have been doing something else			0
it 's a waste of money			0
but that 's the @entity18 for you , " subway rider and former @entity18 employee @entity52 told @entity1 affiliate @entity54			1
the @entity57 was brought to the scene later in the day for crowd control			0
" as the trains backed up , the crowds build up and people are late in their travels			0
we have to make sure everyone gets to their place safely , " lt. @entity64 of the @entity57 said			0
though the sneaky cats were at large on the tracks for more than seven hours , they reappeared around 6 p.m. and were corralled and captured within the half hour , @entity18 spokeswoman @entity69 said			1
they were taken to a nearby shelter , police said			0
it is @entity18 protocol for conductors to stop and call in anytime something is on or traveling on the tracks , so it is in the best interest of customers and @entity18 to clear the track as soon as possible , @entity69 said			1
the pair was found in the same spot where they were first sighted earlier in the day , despite the running trains and the re-electrified deadly third rail			0
it was a close call -- but , luckily , curiosity did n't kill these cats .			0
