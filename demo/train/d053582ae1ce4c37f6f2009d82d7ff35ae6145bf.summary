@entity0 , @entity1 -- two bombs were discovered tuesday inside the bunker where an @entity7 team rescued a 5 - year - old boy from his kidnapper , the agency said			1
the @entity7 said they " disrupted " the two explosive devices			2
one was in the bunker and another was in the pvc pipe that hostage taker @entity14 sometimes used to communicate with the authorities , special agent in charge @entity11 said in a written statement			0
the agency sent in a hostage rescue team after negotiations broke down with @entity14 , who apparently had bombs in the bunker and shot at agents when they stormed the bunker			2
the search for other bombs will continue wednesday , @entity11 said			2
@entity14 had held a 5 - year - old named @entity25 since abducting him from his school bus			1
@entity25 's mother said she awoke tuesday to what she will forever remember as " the most beautiful sight ... my sweet boy			1
" for almost a week , @entity25 , had been held by @entity14 until an @entity7 team rescued him monday afternoon			1
mother and child were reunited at a hospital			0
" i ca n't describe how incredible it is to hold him again , " the mother , who has not been publicly named , said in a written statement			0
" @entity25 is safe and back in my arms , and i owe it all to some of the most compassionate people on @entity43			2
" @entity25 was released from the hospital tuesday afternoon , @entity1 state trooper @entity44 said			1
dozens of people attended a prayer vigil for @entity25 on tuesday night and signed a huge birthday card for the boy , who turns 6 on wednesday			1
tough negotiations a law enforcement source told @entity2 that @entity14 was contentious with authorities from the beginning of the nearly weeklong standoff , but the conversations deteriorated rapidly toward the end			1
the source said investigators talked with @entity14 on the phone , exploring several strategies to resolve the situation , without success			0
" the team kept going back to the same place -- that they had to go in and get @entity25 , " the source said			1
they knew the rescue might be difficult			0
" @entity14 built this bunker specifically for law enforcement not to get in and him to not get out , " the source said			1
@entity14 had reinforced the bunker to prevent others from getting in , @entity11 said			0
law enforcement officers were able to see what was going on inside the underground bunker where the child was held hostage with a camera they slipped into the hideout , a law enforcement official said			1
@entity7 sources said surveillance drones constantly monitored the situation			2
as the standoff dragged on , an @entity7 hostage rescue team practiced on a nearby mockup of the bunker until kidnapper @entity14 ' declining mental state forced them to move in monday afternoon , law enforcement sources said tuesday			1
the resulting assault -- from the top of the bunker , according to another law enforcement source -- ended with @entity14 dead and @entity25 free			1
the other law enforcement official would n't say what exactly was done to get into bunker , but the @entity7 team did n't go in through the hatch			1
authorities took @entity25 to the hospital for evaluation			1
" he was running around the hospital room , putting sticky notes on everyone who was in there , eating a turkey sandwich and watching ' @entity109 , ' " @entity103 superintendent @entity102 said			0
the kidnapping authorities said @entity14 abducted the young boy from a school bus january 29			0
@entity14 approached the bus and demanded that the driver hand over two children			0
@entity14 killed driver @entity14 as he blocked the aisle -- allowing children to escape from the back of the bus -- but @entity14 seized @entity25 and fled to the bunker , according to authorities			1
late @entity1 bus driver called a hero during the ensuing standoff , authorities were extraordinarily tight - lipped about what was happening , but said they were in contact with @entity127 and said they believed he had not harmed the boy			0
he also allowed authorities to deliver food , medicine and at least one toy for the boy to play with , according to authorities			0
the details about the law enforcement response to his abduction are the first provided by authorities about how they knew what was going on inside the bunker and why they decided to move when they did			1
but many questions remain , including whether the @entity142 provided sensing equipment to aid in monitoring what was happening inside the bunker and why @entity14 acted as he did			2
' a big boom ' at one point monday , @entity147 sheriff @entity146 told reporters that @entity14 had " a story that 's important to him , although it 's very complex			0
" but according to a law enforcement source , @entity14 ' mental state deteriorated in the 24 hours before the monday afternoon rescue			1
experts from @entity7 units , including a crisis negotiation team , tactical intelligence officers and a behavioral sciences unit , had determined @entity14 was in a downward psychological spiral , the source said			1
at 3:12 p.m. ( 4:12 et ) on monday , the @entity7 team went in			2
while the law enforcement source said @entity7 agents went in through the top of the bunker , the source declined to say specifically how they breached the roof , how many agents were involved or whether @entity14 shot himself or was killed by @entity7 gunfire			1
a @entity147 official told @entity2 that @entity14 had been shot multiple times			0
the body remains " in the area " and will be examined by the county coroner before it is taken to @entity175 , @entity1 , for autopsy by the @entity1 @entity177 , the official said			0
@entity179 , a former @entity7 assistant director , said the rescue likely was complicated by the layout and materials used to build the underground bunker			1
rescuers would have had to come down stairs , exposing their legs and meaning @entity14 would see them first , he said			0
and if there were brick walls , the @entity7 agents would have to shoot carefully to guard against ricochets -- all that after probably tossing in a flash grenade to stun the kidnapper			1
" the @entity7 hostage rescue team is the best in the world , and they proved it yesterday , " said @entity179 , who was not involved in monday 's rescue			1
a law enforcement source would neither confirm nor deny that a flash grenade was used			1
what 's next for @entity25 ? while @entity25 recuperated tuesday from his ordeal , school officials began planning a party to celebrate the boy 's birthday and to honor @entity205 , the bus driver hailed by school officials as a hero			1
while the party wo n't be ready by @entity25 's birthday , it will be held soon -- likely at the @entity213 football stadium , @entity102 said			1
after being kidnapped , the recovery ahead @entity25 's elementary school principal , @entity215 , said teachers are eager to have him back and " wrap their arms around him			2
" " everybody knows @entity25			2
he 's a good kid , a friendly kid , " @entity215 said			0
relief that @entity25 was safe was palpable in @entity0 , but many questions remain about what comes next for him			2
how does a 5 - year - old heal from this ordeal ? how does a youngster go on after witnessing his bus driver shot to death , then being dragged to an underground bunker by a gun - toting stranger ? how will he deal with what he experienced the six days he languished in that hole and what he saw during the explosive rescue monday that killed his captor ? " it 's very hard to tell how he 's going to do , " said dr. @entity236 , a psychiatrist at @entity238 's @entity237			2
" on the one hand , he might get right back to his routine and do absolutely fine			0
but on the other hand , the anxieties , the trauma , what we call an acute stress disorder , even post-traumatic stress symptoms , can occur			0
" a psychologist said even if @entity25 appears to be doing well on the outside , he needs to talk out what happened to him			2
hoping the 5 - year - old will forget what happened would be a bad strategy , said @entity255			0
" that 's not actually good because when you start to forget , some traumatic events they get stored in your body as feelings that crop up at strange times in your life , " she said			0
" it is better to process it , get some therapy			0
" when terrible things happen : helping children heal someone who knows all too well what @entity25 may go through is @entity271 , who as a 10 - year - old was held underground in a concrete bunker for two weeks by a @entity276 man			1
" i am ecstatic that @entity25 has been retrieved safe and sound , " said @entity277 , who recently released a book about her abduction			2
" as for my ordeal , i just keep thinking about the effects of it : being deprived sunlight , nutritious food and human contact			0
and how much i wanted to have a nutritious meal , see my family			0
" @entity277 says she still feels the effects of her kidnapping			0
" the major issue that i have is control issues with my kids and finances , " she said			0
" i do n't like my kids being out of my sight for more than two seconds			0
and i think that that might get worse as they get older			0
" guiding children through grief and loss support crucial for kids after trauma @entity304 reported from @entity0 ; @entity305 reported and wrote from @entity306			0
@entity2 's @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity315 law enforcement analyst @entity314 also contributed to this report .			1
