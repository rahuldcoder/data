-- striking the right chord with football fans has long proved a tricky proposition for music 's elite			1
throughout the 84 - year history of the @entity7 , stars from across the musical spectrum , from @entity9 to the late @entity10 , have tried -- with varying degrees of success -- to write the soundtrack to the " beautiful game			0
" but 24 years ago , ahead of @entity17 , seminal @entity16 band @entity15 arguably penned the ultimate football anthem			1
to achieve that elusive goal , they had to break a few rules -- most notably , the one that says footballers should n't rap			0
" there was n't supposed to be a rap , " recalls former @entity24 winger @entity23 , who not only starred on the pitch but also performed memorably on @entity15 's " @entity26 " -- the team 's official song for the @entity17			1
" after a while , and a few glasses of wine , someone drunkenly said ' why do n't we just put a rap in it ? ' " he told @entity0			0
" @entity26 " not only became a musical success , providing @entity15 's only @entity16 no. 1 single to date , it also helped redefine football in a country which was falling out of love with the sport after a decade darkened by hooliganism and fatal stadium disasters at @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
unlikely bedfellows @entity15 , one of the most influential @entity16 groups of modern times , and the @entity56 -- then chaired by 75 - year - old @entity57 -- were unlikely collaborators			1
the band is made up of ex-members of @entity61 , whose frontman @entity62 committed suicide in 1980			0
after the singer 's death , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 decided to carry on making music and -- with the addition of @entity71 -- @entity15 was born			1
the now deceased @entity72 , owner of the band 's record label @entity73 , was the instigator of a partnership between the suits who ran @entity80 football and a group of musicians famed for combining post-punk and electronic dance music			1
" @entity72 never told us about it , " recalls @entity15 drummer @entity65			2
" he goes , ' i 've got a great idea , why do n't you do the @entity7 song			0
' we thought it was a terrible idea because all @entity7 songs , football songs in general , were just naff			0
" while many @entity7 songs feature gimmicky lyrics about scoring goals and chasing dreams , @entity15 's ditty rebelled against convention			1
" @entity26 " notably included the lyric , " this ai n't a football song			1
" @entity65 explains : " when we did it , we did talk to a lot of people and say , ' how do you think we should go about doing a football song ? ' " basically we ignored everything they said			2
" it was n't weighed down by everything else that you ever thought about football songs			0
" ' this ai n't a football song ' one snag was that @entity15 was under orders to include the @entity24 team on the record			1
with the help of actor - come - comedian @entity120 -- father of @entity16 popstar @entity121 and " @entity122 " actor @entity123 -- they came across an unlikely solution			2
" we knew @entity120 , " @entity65 says of @entity123 , who has appeared in a host of @entity16 tv shows across the last four decades and is a fan of @entity130 @entity129			2
" he 'd been hanging out at @entity134 quite a lot , " adds @entity65 , referring to the legendary @entity132 club owned by @entity73 and @entity15 members			2
" @entity120 turned up and he wrote the rap			0
that was when it started getting a bit more ' footbally			0
' " the rap would go down in @entity80 football history but @entity15 first had to figure out how to turn the players into part - time musicians			1
the answer , they found out , was champagne			0
" i thought we were rock and roll ! " said @entity65			0
" there was a huge fridge that you would usually have soft drinks in , a wall fridge , full of champagne			0
" we thought , ' yeah they 'll have a couple of bottles			0
' they demolished it , it was empty			0
i do n't know how many bottles there were , but we would never have gone through it			0
" four of the @entity24 squad were dispatched to record the song : @entity23 , fellow @entity169 stars @entity170 and @entity171 , plus @entity173 's @entity172			1
@entity171 , @entity172 and @entity170 all spoke with broad northern @entity80 accents , leaving @entity175 - born @entity23 as the man who would rap his way into the hearts of football fans			1
" with a @entity181 ( a nickname for someone from @entity169 ) and two @entity184 ( someone from @entity186 ) , there was only one person who was going to do the rap , " jokes @entity23			1
@entity172 's tears the song 's success was helped by an @entity24 team which reached the semifinals of the @entity7 for only the second time in its history at @entity17 -- the nation 's best performance since winning the trophy at home 24 years earlier			1
a last - gasp win over @entity198 in the round of 16 and a come - from - behind quarterfinal victory over @entity201 sparked a rush of renewed enthusiasm and patriotism through a country rebuilding its relationship with the national game			0
an agonizing penalty shootout defeat to @entity209 broke @entity80 hearts , with team talisman @entity172 bursting into tears when he picked up a yellow card which would have ruled him out of the final			1
as @entity172 wept , millions cried with him , but once eyes had dried @entity24 could reflect on its most successful @entity7 campaign on foreign soil			2
the performance of the " @entity218 " reignited the country 's passion for football , thanks in no small part to @entity15 and a song which helped redefine the image of the sport in @entity24			1
the @entity51 disaster of 1989 had killed 96 fans , while a fire at the @entity231 stadium in @entity49 was responsible for the deaths of 56 people four years previously			0
the @entity235 tragedy in @entity236 , which occurred during the @entity238 final between @entity169 and @entity239 , had killed 39 people and led to the expulsion of @entity80 clubs from continental competition for five years			2
the sport needed a makeover , one which the members of @entity15 were happy to provide			2
" i do n't know whether you can say it was entirely down to ' @entity26 , ' but i think it did come at a bit of a turning point for football , " recalls @entity65			1
" i think up until that point it was all very laddish and after ' @entity26 ' everybody got a bit loved - up with it			2
" @entity258 is a universal thing , so is football			0
" lasting legacy twenty - four years on the song is mostly remembered for @entity23 ' rap ; even @entity24 fans who were n't alive in 1990 can recite his immortal words			1
but the 50 - year - old is quick to pay tribute to @entity15 , a band that breathed life into a staid and cliched musical genre at a time when the @entity16 dance music scene was exploding			1
" every time the @entity7 comes around people talk about it , which shows how iconic the song was , " says @entity23			1
" i actually did it on the beach last week and it was all over @entity276			0
" in 1990 we captured the imagination of the public , so of course the song went to no. 1			0
if we 'd have got knocked out in the first round , it probably would n't have			0
" it was nice , i got to do it and maybe i got a little kudos from it , but the song was really just a great song by @entity15			2
