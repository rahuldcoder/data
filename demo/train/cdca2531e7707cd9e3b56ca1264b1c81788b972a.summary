-- four decades ago it was merely barren desert land			2
four years ago it was at the height of an unparalleled economic boom that turned to bust amid the global financial crisis			1
today the emirate of @entity8 is staging a lively comeback , once again announcing the kind of ambitious plans that made it famous in the first place			1
most recently , it outlined plans to build a brand new city			1
named after its ruler , @entity17 , it is intended to house a hundred hotels and a @entity21 entertainment center			1
it is the latest in a string of glitzy projects , among them the world 's tallest building , the world 's largest shopping mall -- even man - made islands and in - door ski resorts			2
in 2009 , cheap credit had spurred a considerable real estate bubble in the @entity34 state , which once it burst , caused property prices to tumble and debt to spiral out of control			0
the lifeline came from the neighbor @entity40 , which extended a multi-billion dollar bailout loan			0
@entity8 was forced to get its house in order			2
today , the emirate has gone back to its core strength , @entity46 , senior economist at @entity48 , tells @entity0			0
one of the biggest growth drivers , he says , is the airport activity			0
" it 's estimated that by the end of this year , 56 million people will have gone through @entity8 airports			1
that makes it one of the three to four biggest airports in the world			0
" but travelers are no longer just passing through			0
analysts say the @entity62 has made @entity8 a safe haven for people in the @entity65 who worry about the turmoil elsewhere			1
" tourists from other @entity34 states have increased by 45 % in 2012			0
this has pushed up hotel occupancy to nearly 90 % -- a world record , " @entity69 says			0
" the trajectory is positive at the moment , " says @entity75 , managing director at @entity76 , adding that @entity8 has benefited from rising oil prices			2
yet , for a state that was once riddled with debt , some say financing remains a concern			0
" though @entity8 has been able to make good on all its obligations in 2012 , the @entity8 story can not be completely separated from the debt overhang which is still there , " @entity69 says			2
the hope is that projects like @entity17 will lure millions more visitors a year			1
and though similar projects were shelved only a few years ago , the citizens of @entity8 avow that the hard lessons have been learned .			1
