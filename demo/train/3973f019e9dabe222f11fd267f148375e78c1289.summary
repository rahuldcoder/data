@entity0 , @entity1 -- persistent , heavy rains have helped swell the @entity5 and @entity6 rivers to the highest levels ever recorded , said an @entity9 official sunday			1
this ominous development prompted maj. gen. @entity11 , president of the @entity12 , to order several barges into place at 3 p.m. to begin pumping explosive slurry into a levee near where the two rivers meet			2
this is all in preparation -- if the decision is made -- to blow up the @entity22 levee and potentially flood 130,000 acres of @entity1 farmland , in part to save the town of @entity26 , @entity27			1
at 8 p.m. , the water levels on the @entity6 outside @entity26 had reached 60.27 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the @entity30			1
and , boosted by more rain , the forecast calls for a continued rise to as high as 61.5 feet by tuesday afternoon			2
" this is the largest flood that we have ever seen in our lifetimes , " @entity34 said			2
two states divided by river , flooding the @entity42 @entity41 refused sunday to block any plan to intentionally breach the levee			1
@entity41 @entity45 ruled against @entity1 -- effectively giving @entity34 the authority to execute on the levee - breach plan			1
@entity1 attorney general @entity49 's office had appealed to the court , questioning the @entity9 ' authority to do so			1
he had hoped to overturn a federal judge 's ruling against @entity1 on friday , saying a 1928 law permits the breach of the levee to ease pressure on the river			1
hours before the @entity41 ruling came down , @entity1 gov. @entity59 told reporters sunday that he was not dwelling on the legal battle			1
rather , he said that local and state authorities are focused first and foremost on making all necessary preparations , including steps to protect property and lives , assuming that the levee will be breached and massive flooding will occur			1
" the litigation is out there , but that 's not our focal point , quite frankly , " @entity59 said , flanked by @entity34			0
" this does n't thrill us , where we are , but this is a ( difficult ) situation			0
... we understand the general and his team have difficult decisions to make			0
" @entity34 said he 'd directed crews to move the barges across the river to @entity1 and load the pipes with the blasting agent			1
the entire process -- including priming the explosives and breaching the levee -- would take about 20 hours , at which point the controlled blast could occur			1
" i have not given the command to put it into operation , just to get it to the next step , " @entity34 said			0
the crisis is centered on the stretch of the @entity97 between @entity98 and @entity99 , but it relates to a far broader issue of excess water in the river and its tributaries			0
engineers have warned that should the rising waters of the @entity97 overwhelm the entire flood control project , it could deluge cities , destroy crops , destroy businesses and paralyze river transportation			2
engineers already have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the @entity6 and @entity5 rivers , a condition that @entity34 said also threatens the integrity of the @entity97 and @entity121 -- the world 's largest flood control project			1
belief blog : baptism in floodwaters " there is water in places where we have never ever seen it before , " @entity34 said			0
the potential for disaster -- and with the levees deteriorating and more rain falling -- prompted @entity26 mayor @entity136 to order his city 's 2,800 residents to evacuate by midnight saturday			1
" i 'm here to try to protect the city of @entity26 , " @entity136 said			1
" i care about them and i do n't want them in harm 's way			0
i would much rather issue a mandatory evacuation and nothing happen than not to do it and people lose their life			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 is likewise preparing for the worst -- specifically , the immersion or other negative effects on what @entity59 called " the most productive part of our continent " for farming			1
about 750 @entity157 personnel are in the area , with nearly 100 state police also on hand to safeguard the area and residents ' property			0
in addition , 230 residents who were potentially in harm 's way in @entity5 and @entity168 counties have been evacuated			0
" the point is , if this is going to occur here , we 're going to do it safely , we 're going to do it an orderly fashion and we 're going to do the best we can to defend it and save property where available , " the governor said			2
the uncertain scenario threatened to turned the lives of thousands upside down			0
in @entity182 , @entity1 , @entity181 spent much of her sunday morning in tears , bouncing from her computer to her phone and back again , pausing only to care for her sick toddler			1
she and others are concerned about the economic impact on @entity5 -- and are even more worried about the unforeseen consequences if all does n't go according to plan and water inundates the nearby @entity1 towns of @entity168 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			1
residents are being told a second levee built to protect the towns will hold , but " they really have no clue what 's going to happen , " @entity196 said			2
and even out of the flood plain , she said she 's worried an explosion may trigger an earthquake on the @entity206 , which runs through the region			2
@entity196 posted on her @entity209 page a transcript of a 1988 public meeting in which it was discussed that such a plan could go awry , as the force of the water would be uncontrollable after such a breach and the second levee can not be guaranteed			1
" as we all know too well , plans do n't always go according to plan , especially when @entity97 is involved , " board member @entity216 said , according to the transcript			2
" it has time after time fooled people who were n't fools , people who merely miscalculated , or failed to take into account its almost infinite variables , or used inadequate models , or out - of - date models , or mistaken assumptions			0
" in @entity195 , @entity231 is n't waiting around to find out			0
her family 's bags are packed , she said sunday			0
and should word be given that the levee will be blown up , they plan to head to stay with relatives about 45 minutes away			1
" they did say the secondary levee will hold , but we 've also never been in times like these , " she said			2
" ... i 'm not willing to be the guinea pig			0
that 's the bottom line			0
" @entity231 said her aunt and uncle have evacuated two homes near the levee , moving out all their possessions , and are now living in a camper			2
" they honestly think they 'll have nothing to go back to , " she said , adding the @entity9 has told them the water will cover their home by at least 5 or 6 feet			0
the levee was breached before , in 1937			1
but , @entity196 and @entity231 pointed out , the area was heavily forested then , with trees to slow the water before it reached the second levee			0
that forestation is no longer there , they said			0
@entity49 's office said last week that " the flooding would leave a layer of silt on the farmland that could take as much as a generation to clear , causing significant injury to the quality of the farmland for many years			0
" still , even if they do n't prefer it , not everyone in the @entity1 opposes the levee breach if it 's truly a last resort			1
@entity231 said her family has traditionally made its living farming , but " when it comes over people 's lives to farmland , i say save the lives			1
" " they say it 's going to help @entity26 , then i 'm for it , " she said			2
" but i have a feeling that will destroy @entity5 , financially bankrupt our county			0
" @entity2 's @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity42 @entity41 rules against @entity1 , so levee can be breached
new : the @entity6 at @entity26 , @entity27 , is 60.3 feet -- 50 *%* above flood stage
@entity1 asks the @entity41 to halt a plan to explode a levee to lessen pressure
the *proposal* would flood @entity1 farmland but save an @entity27 town
