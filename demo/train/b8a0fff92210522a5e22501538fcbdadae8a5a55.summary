-- @entity1 has agreed to pay a $ 340 million fine to @entity4 banking regulators to settle charges it laundered money for @entity9 clients -- but the @entity11 bank is far from the only one to be implicated in illegal transactions with sanctioned nations			1
since 2009 , several major international financial institutions have been charged with conspiring to violate @entity16 economic sanctions against doing business with @entity9 and other countries			2
these banks purportedly facilitated the movement of billions of dollars through the @entity16 financial system by falsifying tens of thousands of outgoing @entity16 dollar ( @entity23 ) payment messages for @entity9 and other countries subject to economic sanctions such as @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29			2
the violations involved the practice of " stripping " identifier information from wire transfer documentation to conceal that the transactions were on behalf of @entity9 clients or those from other rogue countries			2
more : @entity37 pays $ 340 million to settle charges the violations of sanctions against @entity9 and other countries were not an accident			1
instead , senior bank officials knowingly and willfully sought to circumvent @entity16 anti-money laundering controls			1
further , bank officials engaged in repeated violations of @entity16 sanctions , stripping the identifier information from tens of thousands of @entity9 transactions valued in the billions			1
the criminal schemes were allegedly perpetrated over an extended period of time , in some cases spanning 10 years or more			0
in each case bank employees permitted @entity9 usd payments to be cleared through @entity16 banks without regard to the ultimate destination of the funds and whether they were intended to finance @entity9 's nuclear missile program or support @entity62 or other terrorist groups			1
@entity1 ( @entity1 ) has agreed to pay the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) $ 340 million to settle charges that the @entity11 bank concealed over $ 250 billion in transactions with @entity9 clients and deliberately lied to @entity4 banking regulators			1
but @entity1 is not an isolated case			0
in 2009 , @entity72 and @entity73 were fined $ 350 million and $ 536 million , respectively , for allegedly removing or altering information to conceal prohibited transactions with @entity9 clients and customers from other sanctioned countries			1
in 2010 , @entity79 and @entity80 were docked $ 500 million and $ 298 million , respectively , for allegedly committing similar crimes			2
more : @entity82 to investigate @entity37 and @entity83 then , this june , @entity84 paid the largest ever fine -- $ 619 million -- against a bank for allegedly moving billions illegally through the @entity16 financial system on behalf of @entity9 and @entity29 clients			1
a @entity88 report in july also implicated @entity83 in laundering money for @entity91 drug cartels and violating sanctions with @entity9			1
that case is still under investigation and no sanctions have been imposed against the bank			0
@entity83 said in a statement at the time that the bank " takes compliance with the law , wherever it operates , very seriously			0
" but rather than provide an answer , the financial fines levied against some of the world 's biggest banks raise disturbing questions about whether the penalties are stiff enough			0
while five banks have entered into deferred prosecution agreements with the @entity112 and agreed to pay fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars , no bank official has been criminally prosecuted and punished			2
more : @entity37 seeks advice over countersuit why not ? clearly , bank officials devised and implemented the fraud schemes that resulted in the concealment of tens of thousands of transactions with an aggregate value in the hundreds of billions of dollars involving sanctioned countries , persons , and entities			1
further , when bank officials masked the identities of @entity9 clients and thwarted @entity16 efforts to detect money laundering and terrorist financing , they violated numerous federal laws , including the @entity130 , and the wire fraud , bank fraud , money laundering , and @entity135 statutes			1
yet the @entity112 has failed to hold bank officials individually liable for their criminal activities			1
why are n't bank officials being held criminally accountable ? perhaps cases such as these are too expensive , time - consuming and difficult to prove for prosecutors			1
or maybe the reason we 're not seeing mass indictments of senior bank officials has to do with a fear that such action could result in the target bank suffering devastating economic losses , which would be passed on to innocent shareholders			2
does this mean that the potential economic consequences resulting from criminal action could make certain banks " too big to prosecute " ? could criminal prosecution of senior bank officials result in the ultimate collapse of the bank ? more : @entity11 mps accuse @entity16 of @entity161 agenda regulators may not want to destroy banks through criminal allegations , but the implication that the worst a crime - committing bank will get is a stiff fine is equally ominous			1
banks could simply decide to evade sanctions laws and anti-money laundering controls , and factor in the monetary sanction as the mere cost of doing business			2
in such cases , then , a criminal fine would have limited deterrent value in preventing unlawful conduct			0
the @entity112 and federal regulators appear to have adopted the policy : " impose a fine against the bank but do n't prosecute suspected corrupt bank officials			1
" if this is the policy the @entity112 plans to adopt , then banks will continue to give short shrift to regulations , including the ban on providing financial services to sanctioned countries			0
if @entity1 allegedly laundered $ 250 billion for @entity9 clients , why did regulators only fine the bank a paltry $ 340 million ? the allegations in the @entity65 order state that @entity1 generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for processing the @entity9 transactions , meaning the @entity1 could still have profited from its unlawful conduct			1
the fine is also substantially less than the $ 619 million fine in june against @entity84 , which was charged with less serious crimes			1
there are a number of possible explanations			0
regulators may believe that additional penalties against @entity1 are on the horizon from the @entity16 @entity208 , but that outcome is hardly guaranteed			0
more : @entity37 tops cruel summer for banks perhaps @entity4 regulators were under mounting criticism and pressure from federal authorities for taking unilateral action against @entity1 and @entity65 wanted to resolve the case as quickly as possible			2
or maybe the @entity65 sincerely believes that the fine , by itself , constitutes a reasonable penalty against @entity1			0
ultimately , none of these explanations are satisfying			0
the @entity65 leveled extremely serious charges against @entity1 , referring to the bank as a " rogue " institution that " left the @entity16 financial system vulnerable to terrorists , weapons dealers , drug kingpins and corrupt regimes			0
" but the final settlement is inconsistent with and diminishes the gravity of the charges levied against the bank			0
what are the implications of the unilateral action taken by the @entity65 against @entity1 ? at the very least , it is abundantly clear that the @entity65 is prepared to act alone when necessary against financial institutions believed to be breaking @entity16 economic sanctions law , rather than follow the lead of federal authorities			0
it also appears the @entity65 is likely to take a more aggressive posture than their federal counterparts with respect to walking the regulatory line			0
but the end result remains a mystery			0
is the ultimate penalty imposed against offending banks going to be more or less severe than sanctions imposed by the federal authorities ? @entity65 's bark worse than its bite ? the @entity65 action against @entity1 raises many unsettling questions for financial institutions moving forward			0
in the end , the justice system can not tolerate a dual system of justice , exempting corrupt bank officials from prosecution for fear of negative economic repercussions			2
no one should be above the law -- even the @entity268 and senior bank officials of some of the world 's largest financial institutions			2
bank officials who knowingly and wilfully violate the laws enacted to prevent banks from being used to facilitate money laundering , terrorist financing , and financial dealings with rogue regimes should be held accountable and punished to the full extent of the law			1
that should be the prosecution policy of the @entity16 @entity112			0
to do otherwise contributes to an environment of impunity and threatens the integrity of the global financial system .			0

@entity37 just one of several banks charged with laundering @entity9 money
@entity37 agrees to $ 340 million fine , but no criminal charges filed against bank officials
