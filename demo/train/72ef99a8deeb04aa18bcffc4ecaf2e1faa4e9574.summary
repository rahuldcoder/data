an @entity4 in @entity5 , he found himself frightened even though the other prisoners were sleeping			1
movie scenes from " @entity8 " and " @entity9 " swirled through his head			0
he sat at a table in the common area , waiting for the others to wake , not knowing what the reaction would be to his presence			0

an avid photographer , @entity1 took his camera to snap photos of houses and a couple of the mosques he passed			1
when he left the second mosque , he was approached by a man in uniform			0
he motioned @entity39 to get into a camouflaged truck			1
" i had no idea what he wanted , " @entity1 said , " but never felt threatened so i got in			1
" he was driven a short distance to a building with a sign out front that read " reception			0
" he waited about an hour before he was guided back outside and told , " do not photograph security areas			2
" @entity1 asked for clarification , but he was waved away with no further explanation , he said			1
he decided to continue his walk			0
a few blocks away , he came upon a sign on a lamppost that said in @entity56 , " @entity57			0
" thinking a photo of the sign would make for a novel @entity61 post , he snapped an image			0
after crossing the road , he was approached by two other uniformed men in a second camouflaged truck and waved into the backseat			0
he was driven back to " reception , " which @entity1 believes was a police station , where his passport , camera and cell phone were seized			1
@entity1 tried to keep his composure			1
he was questioned and moved to different rooms , waiting for hours at a time , but the process was civil , he said			0

when the sun rose that morning , @entity1 was relieved to be greeted with smiles from the other inmates			1
a few prisoners from the @entity92 spoke @entity56			2
their conversation revolved around why @entity1 was there and the daily routine at the jail			1

he was quickly transferred to @entity118 , where he met a @entity119 in his mid- 30s named @entity120			0
" all of those who could speak any @entity56 were very supportive and helpful " in both the prison and the jail , @entity1 recalled , but @entity120 made the most concerted effort			1
well - educated , he had a master 's degree in business administration from @entity128 and spoke fluent @entity56			2
@entity1 called him the cell blocks 's " den mother			1
" he was always trying to help and facilitate the needs of the prisoners who came from countries such as @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 -- all of them foreign workers			2
@entity120 himself had been in prison for six months on an immigration violation			2
when @entity1 first walked in , @entity120 and his roommate , a massive man everyone called " @entity146 , " offered him an orange drink and crackers			1
" @entity151 " did n't speak much @entity56 , @entity1 said , but seemed to be in charge of the cell block			1
@entity120 helped @entity1 settle into the facility , making sure he had snacks and arranging for @entity1 to have his prison clothes laundered			1
in one act of kindness , @entity120 was chatting with his wife on the prison phone and asked @entity1 if there was anyone he wanted to contact			1
@entity120 's wife called @entity1 's daughter on her cell phone and connected the two on the same phone line			1
it was the first time that @entity1 had been able to talk to someone outside of the prison or jail			1
his family finally knew first - hand where he was and what had happened to him			0
as the weeks dragged on , @entity1 became immersed in prison life			1
he walked the cell block halls to pass time , often recalling humorous episodes of " @entity177 " and " @entity178 " to buoy his spirits			0
he and the other prisoners told jokes or talked about funny movies to help inject humor in their otherwise serious world			2
when he got down about his situation , many of the prisoners would ask him to join their conversations , share cookies and boxed drinks they had bought from the canteen or offer food they had cooked in their cells			2
if the prisoner did n't speak @entity56 , a simple smile or thumbs up was offered			1
@entity1 was grateful for the acts of friendship , and he made an effort to reciprocate , he said			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's family , friends and colleagues were raising money to hire an @entity5 attorney and working official channels to get @entity1 released			1
they called themselves @entity210 , friends of @entity1			1
the @entity4 @entity212 sent representatives to meet with black several times while he was at @entity215			0

he continued to endure the daily routines of incarceration while waiting for his case to go before a judge			0
@entity1 was the only westerner in his cell block , though he believes he saw a few others in the prison , he said			1
besides a @entity137 man , he was the only @entity226			0
the rest , if they had religious beliefs , were @entity230			2
five times a day , the devout would roll out their prayer mats			0
@entity1 never spoke much about religion with the other inmates , he said , and he never felt any animosity aimed toward him for being a @entity226			2
he had no biases against @entity230 , and they had no predispositions about him			2
in fact , many of the inmates told @entity1 they prayed he would be released soon , he said			2
on november 17 , almost a month after his arrest , a lawyer pleaded @entity1 's case before the superior court 's three - judge panel			1
" he was very passionate and forceful , " @entity1 said			2
" he told the judges that he thought the case was an embarrassment and that i should have been fined and released the first day			0
" the judges agreed and ruled black " not guilty , no intent to do harm			0
" he was fined 500 dirham , around $ 135 dollars , the minimum fine allowed by the court system			0
it was later waived because of time served			0
it took about 28 hours to get fully processed , and @entity1 immediately made his way to the airport and flew back home to @entity261 , @entity262			1
@entity1 was grateful about how quickly his case was ultimately resolved , he said			2
some of the prisoners he met had been in prison for years , and many still had n't seen their case presented in court			2
the support of his family and friends was important , @entity1 said , but he considered prisoners such as @entity120 his " angels			1
" it was their generosity of spirit , humor and kindness that made a bad situation tolerable			2
the episode reinforced @entity1 's belief that while differences exist among cultures , in the end " we are all human beings			1
" " sometimes it takes something like this to show you people will reach out when you need it , " he said			0
" it 's important to be open to your emotions and know people care			0
" @entity1 plans to keep in touch with some of the men he met in prison , he said , and has already @entity298 with @entity120 , who was recently released and is back in @entity299 .			1

@entity39 was imprisoned in october for taking a photograph in @entity5
at first , he was frightened , but prisoners , most of them @entity230 , made him feel welcome
one prisoner had his wife call @entity1 's daughter , so @entity1 could speak to her from prison
