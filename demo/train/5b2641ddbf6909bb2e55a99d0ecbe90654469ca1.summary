-- a third of the houses on @entity4 's second most expensive street are lying vacant , many abandoned for decades and left to rot			1
behind the padlocked gates and long driveways , up to 20 mansions stand empty on @entity9 's @entity8 , despite a reported combined value of around £ 350 million ( $ 582 million )			1
dubbed " @entity11 , " the road 's average house costs over £ 6 million ( $ 9.98 million ) , but many have been deserted by their wealthy owners			1
despite their dilapidated condition , the houses remain a safe place for wealthy foreigners to park their money because of @entity9 's rocketing property prices , which rose 11 % last year , and because of the road 's reputation as a magnet for the rich and famous			1
@entity25 , a property developer appointed by a hedge fund owner to manage six of the vacant homes , calls it one of " the most expensive wastelands in @entity30			2
" he 's hoping to get permission to convert decaying mansion @entity32 into luxury apartments			0
bought 25 years ago by a prominent @entity37 family but never lived in because of planning permission complications , the once - magnificent mansion was abandoned and has fallen into disrepair			0
@entity25 showed @entity0 through the property , revealing animal skeletons lying on moss - covered floors , paint ripped off the damp - soaked ceilings and stairs which have partially collapsed			0
@entity47 , 200 meters up the road , is on sale for £ 40 million ( $ 67 million ) and estate agent @entity49 says investors are n't put off by the numerous abandoned homes on the road because @entity8 " is an iconic road , like @entity54 or @entity55			1
" buying a house here " is a statement of wealth ... a statement that you 've arrived , " he told @entity0			0
the street has long been a landing pad for wealthy investors in developing countries undergoing geopolitical chaos : @entity72 after the 1979 revolution , eastern @entity30 after the collapse of the @entity68 and most recently , @entity70 oligarchs , he said			0
but , as @entity4 faces a housing shortage and soaring property prices , @entity8 's empty mansions are likely to add to debate over taxes payable by overseas property buyers -- particularly if they remain empty			2
however , @entity78 , who heads the local government branch of @entity80 , told @entity0 he " would rather spend public money bringing family houses back into use than getting involved in battles with the lawyers of billionaires			0
