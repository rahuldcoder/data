@entity0 -- @entity3 's former top intelligence official says the country does not have the ability to stop @entity7 's nuclear program and that a pre-emptive attack against the @entity9 would result in a regional war that would pose @entity3 with an " impossible " challenge			1
" we do not have the ability to stop @entity7 's nuclear program			1
in the best case scenario we can push it off a bit , " said former @entity15 chief @entity14 in widely reported remarks to a @entity18 leadership conference wednesday			0
" it is important to know what the outcome of an attack on @entity7 would be , what would happen on the day after and what situation @entity3 would find itself in on the international stage , " @entity14 said			1
" an attack on @entity7 would mean regional war , and in that case you would have given ( @entity7 ) the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program because the @entity7 would then claim , ' we have been attacked by a foreign country that is reported to have a military nuclear capability			1
now we have no choice but to defend ... against a country with strategic capabilities -- a compelling and principled argument for them to move to a large nuclear program , " he added			0
" it is important to know that that war would not just be against @entity7			0
it would be a regional war that would include @entity49 -- if we needed to attack @entity51 targets in @entity49 territory			2
the regional challenge that @entity3 would face would be impossible			2
" the blunt public comments , which have been printed in various @entity3 newspapers , are not the first from @entity14 , who spent the last eight years heading the @entity3 spy agency			0
@entity14 left his position in january and in recent weeks has made a series of comments that have been at odds with the public policy positions of @entity3 prime minister @entity63 on the sensitive issue of @entity7 and it 's nuclear program			1
@entity63 has repeatedly maintained in public that all options including military force should be considered to force @entity7 to halt its nuclear program			1
both @entity3 and the @entity70 believe @entity7 is developing nuclear weapons -- an allegation leaders in @entity73 deny , maintaining the program is for civilian use only			2
in his comments , @entity14 compared the strategic environment facing @entity3 to the eve of the @entity79 in 1973 and warned that the country should go to war only if it was attacked " or if there is a gun to your head -- that is to say , conflict is unavoidable and the only way to minimize the threat is to use violence			2
" @entity14 suggested conflict was not yet unavoidable and offered advice to the prime minister " not to make a decision to attack @entity7			1
" " it is important to consider all options and not to run straight for the war option			0
at the moment no decision has been made to attack @entity7 , and i am not familiar with any decision to attack in 2011 or 2012 , " @entity14 told the audience			1
in addition to @entity7 , @entity14 said it was crucial for @entity3 to present some sort of plan for getting talks restarted with @entity106 and suggested adopting the 2002 @entity108 initiative , which outlines normalization of relations with @entity112 countries in exchange for a @entity106 state based on 1967 lines with a " just solution " to the @entity106 refugee issue			2
" we have no other way , and not because they are my top priority , but because i am concerned about @entity3 's well - being and i want to do what i can to ensure @entity3 's existence , " @entity14 said " if we do n't make proposals and if we do n't take the initiative , we will eventually find ourselves in a corner			1
" it is not uncommon for former @entity3 intelligence chiefs to be speak publicly , but for the widely respected @entity14 to speak so openly and so soon after his departure has raised eyebrows in @entity3			0
to that point , @entity14 told the @entity18 audience " it is important for ex-officials to make their opinions known			0
" the office of prime minister @entity63 declined to comment on @entity14 's remarks			1
earlier in the year @entity14 courted controversy when he stated that @entity7 would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon before 2015			0
which prompted @entity63 to disagree publicly stating , " i think that intelligence estimates are exactly that , estimates			0
they range from best case to worst case possibilities , and there is a range there , there is room for differing assessments			0

@entity14 is the former head of @entity3 's @entity15
he says an attack on @entity7 to stop @entity7 's nuclear program would provoke a regional war
an attack would leave @entity3 with an " impossible " challenge , he says
@entity3 prime minister @entity63 has maintained all options should be considered
