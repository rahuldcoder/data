the deepening of the shipping channel in @entity3 , @entity4 , wo n't be dredging up just mud and sand			1
it will be raising up a link to the past : an ironclad that protected the city during the @entity12 until the vessel met its undignified demise			1
for about the next nine months , divers will be working to bring up the @entity4 , piece by rusted piece , from nearly 40 feet down in the @entity18			1
the $ 706 million harbor deepening officially began thursday with speeches and the firing of an old cannon at @entity23 near the wreck site			1
the removal of the @entity4 is necessary for the state and federal project , which will see the channel go from 42 to 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide			1
while some material from the @entity41 vessel was recovered after the war , four artillery pieces , parts of the propeller and propulsion system , a boiler and two casemates , which housed the artillery pieces , remain in the swift , dark waters			2
one of the casemates is huge : 68 feet by 24 feet			2
" she is really in large sections scattered throughout the bottom down there , " @entity45 , archaeologist with the @entity46 in @entity3 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity47			1
the @entity4 did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the @entity55			1
instead , the vessel became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces			2
the @entity59 refused to take on the @entity4 or other nearby defense obstructions			1
the @entity4 won the battle , but lost the war : the vessel was scuttled in december 1864 shortly before @entity65 forces took @entity3 and presented the city to president @entity67 as a @entity69 present			1
the shipwreck has rested in the river since , rarely disturbed and having weathered the indignity of being hit during dredging a couple of times over the years			0
recovery of the ironclad will cost between $ 14 million and $ 15 million , @entity46 officials said			1
contract divers have been at the site and are first mapping , tagging and putting a recovery grid in place			0
a network of ropes connects wreck site artifacts and helps divers navigate the river floor			0
they will be recovering small artifacts , such as fasteners or small personal items			0
the second phase , expected to begin in may or june , will be the recovery of the large pieces			0
@entity96 and other divers will take special care because of the possibility of live ammunition and powder			0
@entity102 of @entity103 told affiliate @entity104 that in at least the first phase , only one diver will be underwater at a time			0
" for every person we have on the bottom , there 's four more people up on the surface that are tending him , talking to him and being sure that whatever he is doing is safe , " said @entity102			0
archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the @entity4 through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed			2
conservation of selected artifacts and parts of the @entity4 will be done at @entity127 and will take about two years to complete			2
the remains of the @entity4 may answer some mysteries , including its dimensions and the manner of construction			2
the casemates were made of railroad iron			0
the vessel could handle 10 guns , though fewer were onboard when it was destroyed			0
there are no known blueprints for the ironclad , which was produced in @entity3 in 1862 as part of a defensive naval squadron			1
former @entity144 rep. @entity143 of @entity4 , speaking at thursday 's kickoff , said the harbor deepening is important for the state 's economy , jobs and recognition of its history			1
while officials have made no determination of where @entity4 artifacts may eventually reside , @entity143 believes they should stay in @entity3 , perhaps at @entity23			1
" we need it to stay here			0
it will help @entity3 in terms of tourism			2
it will help tell our story			0
it will enhance our reputation from an historical viewpoint			0
we need to make sure it does stay local , " he said , reported @entity47			0
besides deepening the channel of the @entity18 , the @entity46 will extend the shipping lane an additional 7 miles in the @entity55 off @entity168			1
on the river - based portion , the @entity46 will be installing a dissolved oxygen injection system to protect marine life .			0

$ 706 million harbor deepening officially begins in @entity3 , @entity4
a @entity12 ironclad must be moved so the shipping channel can be deepened
the @entity4 never fired a shot in anger during the @entity12
