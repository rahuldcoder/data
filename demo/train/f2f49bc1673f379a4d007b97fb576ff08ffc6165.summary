-- how does your sex life measure up ? that 's the central premise of " @entity4 , " a new book by @entity6 and sociologists @entity7 and @entity9			1
based on the responses of an @entity13 survey of some 70,000 people , " @entity4 " endeavors to ease people 's concerns about their sexual relationships by providing readers with an idea of what 's " normal " for most couples -- from how often they have sex , to how sexually adventurous they are , to how they romance each other outside the bedroom			1
" it is n't about a 98.6 kind of normal -- just the normal of exceptionally happy couples ( gay and straight ) and what we can learn from them , " @entity7 says			0
one juicy nugget -- 86 % of all men and women are intrigued by having kinky sex			1
" this just goes to show that both men and women want to be kept on their toes , " says @entity35 , sex educator and entrepreneur			1
" i ca n't think of any couple who would be ' satisfied ' with predictable sex for the same reason people do n't watch the same movie every weekend : there 's no mystery , no excitement			1
" admittedly it 's hard to resist checking out how we match up to other people between the sheets			1
" couples that come into my practice with complaints about their sex life are often comparing themselves to a rather unrealistic and fictitious standard , " dr. @entity54 says			2
" they have grown up watching @entity62 flicks believing that bedroom passion should be spontaneous			0
" adds social psychologist @entity64 , " almost all couples , both heterosexual and same - sex , worry about how their relationship stacks up			2
this naturally leads us to compare our relationships to those of other couples			0
" it may be natural , but is that comparison healthy ? it depends , say experts			0
" it 's tempting to think that statistics about how often other people have sex can tell you how often you should be having sex , " explains @entity76 , a sex health educator			2
" but other people 's sex lives have nothing to do with yours			1
experiencing sex differently does n't mean you 're doing it wrong , it just means you 're doing it differently			0
" on the other hand , the quest to keep up with the @entity95 ' sex life can have its perks , too			0
although comparison " can be destructive if you think of the ' norms ' as being ideals to strive for , it can also be empowering if it makes you feel that your experience has been validated and that you are less alone , " says @entity98 , a sex therapist and pioneer in her work with the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender community			0
" because kink and open relationships are more common among lesbian , gay and bisexual people , these couples face more options and choices , something that can add a layer of complexity to a couple 's sex life as well as more freedom			1
" @entity122 may even inspire you to amp up your sex life a bit			0
for instance , " @entity4 " authors found that 48 % of men want their female partners to be more romantic -- and that the no. 1 thing they want more of is communication , not sex			1
" responses like these might encourage some women to raise the bar on how they talk and act in the bedroom , " sex educator @entity132 says			2
the survey results call into question stereotypes that men compartmentalize sex and emotions , says @entity143 , a psychotherapist in @entity144			1
" men are often described as rigidly separating sex and feelings , " he says			2
" however , many straight , gay or bisexual men i encounter in my clinical practice appreciate meaningful sexual intimacy			0
they often long for a sexuality anchored in the complicity and playfulness of their romantic relationship			0
" one of the goals of " @entity4 " is to get couples talking about their sex lives and trying new things			1
it 's an experience that @entity76 sees reflected in her own work as a college sex educator			2
" by the end of the semester , my students know they 're normal , but not because their quantity , quality or frequency of sex falls within some statistical range , compared to other people , " she says			0
" they feel normal because they understand how varied people are , how many different ways there are to be ' normal , ' and that the real measure for ' normal ' is mutual consent and satisfaction			0

" @entity4 " aims to get couples talking about their sex lives
survey shows 86 % of all men and women are intrigued by having kinky sex
expert : it 's hard not to wonder how we match up to other couples in bed
