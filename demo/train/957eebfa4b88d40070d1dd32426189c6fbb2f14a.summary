@entity0 -- @entity4 's second - largest train manufacturer will recall 54 bullet trains running on the new @entity7 high - speed railway after a series of malfunctions , a company official said friday			1
the state - owned @entity10 earlier this week suspended deliveries of the same model for safety reasons			1
" all decisions are based on safety and we are trying to be responsible , " said @entity14 , a company spokesman			0
the news came on the heels of a @entity4 government announcement to slow down bullet trains nationwide and halt approval for new construction , amid increasing public scrutiny on the country 's railway safety following a crash last month that killed at least 40 people			1
premier @entity31 this week also ordered railway authorities , who had planned to invest over $ 400 billion into new projects in the next five years , to conduct thorough safety inspections on all high - speed rail lines both in operation and under construction , state - run @entity30 news agency reported			1
" right now we are checking and eliminating all potential safety vulnerabilities , " railway minister @entity38 said in thursday 's edition of the @entity42 's @entity41 newspaper			0
" down the road we want to strengthen our management to ensure rail operations be safe , sustainable and stable			0
" @entity38 said bullet trains would run 40 to 50 kilometers below their top design speed , which currently stands at 350 kilometers per hour ( 217 mph ) for the fastest model , and ticket prices would be reduced accordingly			1
the actions were prompted by the government after a stalled bullet train was struck from behind by another train on july 23 near @entity56 in eastern @entity58 province , causing one of @entity4 's deadliest rail accidents in recent years			2
@entity62 officials later blamed design flaws in the rail signal equipment as the culprit			0
many in the public remain skeptical of the finding , still fuming over reports that the railway ministry ended its search - and - rescue effort less than six hours after the collision , and moved to crush and bury one of the six derailed cars when the investigation had barely started			2
although railway authorities have denied such allegations , a panel consisted of high - ranking government officials -- none from the railway ministry -- and academic experts has taken over the investigation and is expected to produce its report in september			2
reactions were mixed to the government decision to decelerate the country 's trains			0
" this is a rational policy to correct the ' great leap forward ' strategy of our high - speed railway development , " professor @entity89 , a transportation expert with @entity90 , told @entity1			1
" it should have been done earlier -- but this is a good start			0
" @entity89 , a long - time critic of @entity4 's high - speed rail plans , said slower trains would improve safety and cut operational cost , benefiting both operators and passengers			1
but others compare the new measure to " stopping eating after choking on food			0
" " the problem is obviously with management , but they simply decided to reduce the speed , " a user named " usinner " wrote on @entity108 , a popular railway internet forum			0
" if they do n't address the real problem , trains are still going to crash even when running below 100 kilometers per hour			0
" now the world 's second - largest economy , and flush with cash , @entity4 has built the world 's longest high - speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers ( 5,100 miles ) of routes -- in a few short years			1
officials have portrayed the development of high - speed rail as a symbol of the country 's growing prowess and also want to export @entity4 technologies to markets that include the @entity130			1
the massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines ' safety and commercial viability			2
the skeptics ' voices became louder after the former railway minister -- a champion of high - speed rail -- was sacked for corruption early this year			1
even the @entity7 high - speed rail -- the ministry 's newest and proudest project -- has broken down several times since its much - touted launch less than two months ago			1
" it 's not the faster , the better , " @entity146 , a railway professor at @entity147 in @entity7 -- and now a member of the investigative panel on the deadly crash -- told @entity1 in june			0
" we have to take safety , economics and environmental impact into consideration			0
" eager to reassure skeptics home and abroad , @entity4 leaders have said the government would learn its lessons from the fatal bullet train collision -- even it means to swallow national pride for now			2
" if safety is compromised , there is no credibility to speak of , " @entity31 said during a visit to the crash site on july 28			2
" it is important that we integrate our effort in pursuing speed , quality , efficiency and safety with the understanding that safety always comes first			0

the recall involves 54 bullet trains made by the state - owned @entity10
there is extra public scrutiny after a crash last month killed at least 40 people
the @entity4 government is slowing down bullet trains in the *aftermath*
premier @entity31 is ordering safety inspections on high - speed lines
