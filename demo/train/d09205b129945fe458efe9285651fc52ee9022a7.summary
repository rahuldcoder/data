-- on 9 march 2010 i stood outside the international bus terminal on @entity3 in @entity4 , waiting for the 11 a.m. bus from @entity6 to arrive			1
it was cold and breezy , typical of march in the @entity9 capital			1
a steady stream of tourists emerged from the buses and headed to see the palaces of the @entity14			1
@entity15 had told me there would be a @entity18 team shadowing me			1
i looked at a man in a cowboy hat on the street corner checking his watch			1
surely they would not be that obvious			2
she wore a long black skirt as i had anticipated , but instead of being fully veiled , she was wearing a simple headscarf			2
a few stray strands of blonde hair fluttered in the breeze			2
i 'm @entity31 , ' she said in soft - accented @entity32 , fixing me with her blue - green eyes			2
despite the fact that @entity35 had instructed me to wear @entity37 clothes to avoid suspicion , i had to keep my distance from a woman who was not related to me			1
i did n't even shake her hand			2
but i was impressed ; the photos had not done her justice			2
@entity31 was strikingly pretty , with full lips , high cheekbones and an angular nose			2
she looked several years younger than her age , thirty - two			0
@entity47 , i thought -- @entity48 will love this girl			0
i had come across her on a @entity51 fan page for @entity35 in november 2009 -- two months after he had repeated his request that i find him a wife in the @entity54			1
i had left a message on the site requesting support and @entity31 had replied			0
' what kind of support and are you in direct contact with @entity61 ? ' she wrote in her first message on 28 november 2009			0
two days later , after we exchanged several messages , she wrote this : ' i have one question tho			0
do you know personally @entity68 ? and if it is so , may i be so liberal to ask you something ? @entity68 was our code for @entity35			1
' yes i do know him			0
feel free to ask , ' i replied immediately			0
she had written back : ' i sent @entity61 a letter by mail , i am not sure if i had his correct email address , but actually i was wondering will he search for a second wife , i proposed him a marriage , and i do not know how silly it is			1
now , as i am in contact with you there is a possibility for you to get know me better in a way you can recommended me			0
' i seek a way how to get out of this country , and i search a husband who will teach me and whom i can help a lot			0
i deeply respect him and the all things he do for this @entity92 and i want to help him in any way			0
' i wrote back : ' you will be wife number 3 , as he already got two wives , however he do n't stay with them because they are in the capital , and only see him now and then			1
but you will stay with him all the time , as you do n't have a family there			0
you should expect hardship , and moving from place to place once in a while			0
taking care of your duties in house as a wife			1
be patience with all what you will see and face , as @entity68 may be expose to danger etc. and @entity113 is our protector			0
can you accept this ? ' she replied within ten minutes : ' i would go with him anywhere , i am 32 years old and i am ready for dangerous things , i am not afraid of death or to die in the sake of @entity113			0
i did n't know he has 2 wife already			1
but i do not mind at all			0
i want to help him in his work ... i am good in housekeeping job [ and ] i 'm willing to be a very hardworking and active wife			1
' agent storm : inside @entity129 for the @entity18			1
