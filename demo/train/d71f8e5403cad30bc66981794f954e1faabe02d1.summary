less than a week after drug lord @entity2 was released from prison because of procedural errors , the @entity1 government wants him locked up			1
the office of the @entity1 attorney general late wednesday said that it has issued a warrant for " provisional detention , " acting on a request from the @entity10			1
a @entity1 judge signed off on the request			2
once @entity2 is detained , the office said , the @entity10 will have 60 days to formally request his extradition			2
attorney general @entity15 earlier said his office would review the decision of a @entity1 appeals court to release the trafficker			1
@entity2 had served 28 years when he was freed friday because he was tried in the federal system , when his crimes should have been dealt with at the state level			1
he was convicted of torturing and killing @entity24 agent @entity23 in 1985 , but the appeals court dismissed that conviction			0
" i am studying the reasons of why he was freed , " @entity26 said			0
" the attorney general 's office will use the resources available to it ... to avoid this type of impunity			1
" the attorney general told journalists that there was no extradition request in place at the time that @entity2 was freed , and it is unclear whether any such request has been filed since last week , according to the state - run @entity42 news agency			1
when asked by @entity46 , neither the @entity44 nor the @entity45 would say whether they had requested @entity2 's arrest			1
@entity2 remained on the @entity24 's most - wanted list during his incarceration in @entity1			2
because the appeals court had vacated his conviction for @entity23 's murder , any extradition request would have to be for other crimes , @entity26 said , according to @entity42			0
the ruling also dismissed accusations against @entity2 of the killings of two other @entity10 -- @entity58 of @entity59 and @entity60 of @entity61			2
the family of one of the @entity10 killed says they were targeted in retaliation for @entity24 drug raids			0
a conviction for drug trafficking was upheld , but @entity2 had already completed the prison sentence for that crime , the ruling said			0
he was indicted in the @entity71 of @entity72 in 1988 on racketeering charges , which were eventually augmented with charges of kidnapping and murder of a federal agent			0
a second indictment in the same district charges @entity2 with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana			0
he also was indicted in the @entity83 on drug trafficking charges .			0
