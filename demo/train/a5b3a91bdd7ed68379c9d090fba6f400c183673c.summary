editor 's note : join @entity2 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity4 at 10:30 a.m. et wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			2
a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 has said he will vote for @entity8 in november			1
he is the author of " listening to the @entity9 " and " speak , @entity10 ! a @entity12 's view of @entity13			2
" visit his web site for more information			2
@entity2 says @entity16 should be given hell for its actions against @entity19			1
( @entity4 ) -- in the 19 years that @entity21 has published her magazine , @entity19 , she has never faced a major situation with @entity25 bookstores across the country that carry the publication			1
she 's tackled any number of issues over the years , and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers , ranging from @entity33 to @entity34 to @entity35			2
but when the @entity37 , @entity38 , entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month , she says , @entity16 treated her like she had converted her @entity25 publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor @entity44			1
apparently , the owner of @entity16 , the @entity46 , was n't too happy with @entity47 telling the story of female pastors , because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor			1
according to @entity47 , the @entity25 company did n't even give her the courtesy of a heads - up			2
" we got an anonymous tip , " she told me tuesday on the @entity60 , and after checking it out , she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of @entity16 's 100 - plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter			1
" they have never called me , " @entity47 said			0
" never sent an e-mail			0
i had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done			0
" the actions of @entity16 did n't stun me			2
i had seen this movie before			0
a few years ago , my wife was a longtime @entity16 teacher			2
she had taught at the company 's teaching centers for years , but then one day , she was notified that she would have to take down her web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher			1
her crime ? calling herself the rev. @entity85			0
it was n't that she did so for the heck of it			0
she graduated from @entity89 ; was the first female staff pastor at @entity92 's @entity91 / the @entity93 , a @entity46 church ; and has been leading folks to the @entity96 all over the country for 20 years			1
she was angered by @entity16 's decision but made it clear that she did n't serve the bookstore or even the @entity46			1
she made a commitment to serving @entity102 and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male - dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the @entity107 calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit			0
so she cut them off and kept on calling herself the rev. @entity85			0
religious folks will quickly say that @entity107 is clear that women ca n't be pastors and lead men , yet @entity47 says that when she featured pastor @entity116 on her cover two years ago , @entity16 did n't take any action against the magazine			1
anyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith 's writings , while others have a different interpretation			0
i 've heard @entity132 's pastor , the rev. dr. @entity131 , preach several sermons stating that what @entity134 wrote in 2 @entity136 with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban			0
second , there were instances where @entity134 wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from @entity144			0
that is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time ( and i love it how these same @entity107 thumpers ignore the biblical story of @entity151 , who was a judge in the @entity152 -- and was over men )			0
but what is a greater issue is that @entity16 clearly has no respect for freedom of the press			1
here is arguably the top @entity25 bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine			1
a spokesman for @entity165 , which runs the stores , was quoted in the @entity167 last week as saying of female pastors , " it is contrary to what we believe			1
" so does @entity16 and , by extension , the @entity46 , fight vigorously for freedom of religion , but it does n't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the @entity13 @entity176 ? i now wonder whether @entity16 makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves			1
this is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion			0
i suppose it 's fitting that this story would come out the same time as @entity191 releases his religious documentary , " religulous , " which skewers all the major religions for their dogma			0
i 'm sure he feasted on positions of the @entity46			2
the conduct of @entity16 and the @entity46 is shameful , and they owe @entity47 an apology for their actions			1
yet she 's taken it in stride , saying that instead of giving the company hell , she 'll " give them heaven			0
" i say , give them a lot of hell for this , because they deserve it for actions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity16 stores put @entity25 magazine behind counter
@entity220 featured female pastors on its cover
@entity16 has no respect for @entity225 , @entity2 says
@entity16 , @entity46 should apologize , he says
