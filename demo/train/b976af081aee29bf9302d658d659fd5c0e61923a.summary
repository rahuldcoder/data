-- the road back to the top of world golf is proving to be a long and arduous one for former world no. 1 @entity4			2
but a legend of the game has seen enough in the 14 - time major winner 's recent game to suggest he is closing in on his best form			1
ahead of the annual @entity12 tournament he hosts at the @entity13 in @entity14 , seven - time major champion @entity10 warned the field at this weekend 's event to be wary of a revitalized @entity17			1
woods still a force in video - game world " i 'm watching him swing and i 'm watching him play , and i see some moments of the old - fashioned @entity4 that are very good , " the 82 - year - old @entity10 told reporters			1
" so you know , if i were making a prediction , i would say , look out , because one of these days , he 's going to come back and play pretty good golf			0
" @entity4 has been plagued by knee and @entity31 injuries in recent years , as well as going through a high - profile divorce after details of his extra-marital affairs emerged in late 2009			1
but , having slipped outside the world 's top - 50 rankings in october last year , he won the unsanctioned @entity38 event he hosts in december and then finished tied for third at the @entity40 in january -- his debut event for 2012			2
however , the 36 - year - old was hampered by an @entity31 complaint at the recent @entity45 event at @entity46 , where he pulled out midway through the final round			1
there were initial fears the injury could force @entity17 out of the masters , where he has worn the fabled @entity54 on four occasions , but those concerns were allayed when he played in the @entity57 earlier this week			2
@entity4 played a practice round at @entity59 on sunday , before pulling up while preparing for the @entity60 -- which he has won six times -- after being distracted by a photographer during his downswing			1
" i guess one of the so - called professional photographers took a picture right in the middle of my downswing , " @entity4 told reporters			0
" i stopped it , and then felt a pretty good twinge in my back			0
" i walked it off and then tried to hit one down there , hit it in the fairway , but it did n't feel very good			0
but after a couple of holes it loosened up and i 'm good to go now			0
" @entity4 has been paired with @entity83 @entity82 teammate @entity81 and three - time major winner @entity84 for thursday 's first round at @entity13 and he is feeling confident after his outing at the @entity57			1
" that 's one of the reasons why i played @entity89 , " he said			0
" it felt great at @entity59 , and that was the test			0
i played @entity89 because of that test , and here i am ready to go			0
