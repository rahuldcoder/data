, is the star of " living with @entity7 " it 's a reality show that follows him and his wife @entity9 , as they attempt to live the green life on the outskirts of @entity13 , while competing to out - eco neighbor @entity14			1
@entity1 has been a committed environmentalist for decades and is the author of " @entity17 : a guide to the @entity19			1
" @entity0 asked him what it takes to " live like @entity1 " and his take on the current state of environmentalism			1
@entity0 : what do you hope to achieve with " @entity28 " ? @entity1 : to engage viewers with entertainment , then give them a " take - away " or two every show that will save them money and help the environment			1
@entity0 : when did you " go green " , and why ? @entity1 : i did it because my father , @entity37 was a conservative that liked to conserve			1
we always lived in a modest home			2
we turned off the lights , turned off the water , saved string , tin - foil , we threw precious little away			2
so , by the time @entity46 came around in 1970 , i was primed and ready to take some additional steps , and do more			2
it 's worth noting that my father died a few days before the first @entity46 , so i did it to honor him , as much as anything else			0
@entity0 : the show has been very successful -- have you been surprised by the level of interest ? @entity1 : yes			1
i 've tried other " green " shows in the past			0
i credit " @entity28 " success to the addition of my wife to the mix. @entity0 : right now it seems like environmentalists are losing ground to climate change deniers over global warming , with the email scandal at the @entity70			0
some polls show less people believe the science than a year ago			2
do you ever get despondent ? what gives you hope ? @entity1 : i find it a bit unsettling that the deniers are winning , for now			1
but , i think more people will understand our role in climate change over time			0
i just hope it 's not too late			2
@entity0 : do you think one of the problems is that people feel overwhelmed -- both with fear for the future and the level of effort required to think about the moral , ethical dimension of all their consumer choices ? if so , how can we move beyond this ? @entity1 : it 's human nature to resist change			1
we did with our efforts to combat smog in the early 1970s			0
but finally people realized that we would n't go broke cleaning up the air , if we did it right			0
they soon became aware that there were jobs making catalytic converters , combined - cycle gas turbines , spray - paint booths and cleaner fuels			2
we need to remind folks of our success in improving air quality and how similar clean - tech industries can spur the economy again today			2
@entity0 : if you could ask @entity0 readers to do one thing , what would it be ? @entity1 : get out of your car as much as you can			1
ride a bike , if weather and fitness permit			0
take public transportation , if it 's available near you			0
@entity0 : do you think we should stop eating meat ? @entity1 : i stopped eating meat in 1970 , and i 'm a very healthy 60 - year old man			1
it can be good for our health , and the health of the planet			0
@entity0 : in the end , do you think making personal changes to our lifestyle will be enough ? or do we need a lead from government ? @entity1 : personal action is one important component [ but ] government and industry must also do their fair share			1
@entity0 : do you think that any big environmental legislation is likely in the @entity149 , given the scale of opposition ? @entity1 : sadly , there will be no strong environmental laws passed anytime soon , as the extractive industries have been successful at convincing folks that we ca n't afford them			1
to give another prospective , [ i 'll not ] only quote an oil man but the name of @entity160 who said , " we ca n't drill our way out of this problem "			0
@entity0 : if you had the chance to whisper some advice in president @entity170 's ear , what would it be ? @entity1 : be true to the environmental ethic that you forged in the @entity172			1
do what 's right , and great good will come of it ; hopefully , sooner , rather than later			0
@entity0 : do you have a message for climate change skeptics ? @entity1 : let 's agree to disagree			1
let 's pursue fiscally sound green technology for the following reasons : to lessen our dependence on foreign oil , to clean up the air in our cities , to put money in our pockets			0
and if you do it right , you just bought an insurance policy to protect you against climate change , if the many scientists who believe in it are correct			0
@entity0 : arguably , we are moving into politically uncharted territory now , and the scale of the global co-operation required to deal with global warming , biodiversity loss and the other environmental problems we face is unprecedented in human history			0
do you think we can do it ? @entity1 : yes			1
but , we must act now			0
tomorrow is too late .			0
