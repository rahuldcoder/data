-- this year 's race for best actor at the @entity3 was supposed to have been the most wide open in decades , with candidates ranging from two - time winner @entity5 for " @entity6 " to newcomer @entity7 for " @entity8			1
" the 77 - year - old veteran @entity9 gave a signature performance as an addled senior citizen in " @entity12 , " while @entity13 delivered a flamboyant tour de force in " @entity15 of @entity16			0
" and it was a banner year for black actors , with the @entity3 - worthy performances of @entity20 in " @entity21 , " @entity22 in " @entity23 " and @entity24 in " 12 years a slave			1
" now , with voting completed and less than a couple days away from @entity3 night , the pundits , prognosticators and tea - leaf readers agree that the winner will be ... none of the above			2
@entity5 , @entity7 , @entity20 and @entity22 were n't even nominated			0
and as the @entity34 patient who smuggles unapproved but effective medication to help others with the disease in " @entity38 , " @entity32 raised his ever - expanding professional profile as a versatile leading man while showing he could physically commit to his work			1
he shed almost 50 pounds and , going further , secluded himself from social interaction to achieve the gaunt pallor of a dying man			1
that level of investment , combined with an intense performance , combined to make @entity32 such a prohibitive favorite for the best actor prize that , even with such sterling competition as @entity9 , @entity13 , @entity24 and @entity52 , who gained weight and wore a comb - over wig as a con artist in " @entity56 , " it would be a stunner if he loses			1
if ... ok , fine , when @entity32 steps to the winner 's circle sunday night after his name is announced , it will represent the latest manifestation of the @entity63 ' historic tendency to honor actors who make heads swivel by changing their image , professional or physical ; the more dramatic and conspicuous the transformation , the better the chances that actor , or actress , will be rewarded			1
for instance , 10 years ago , onetime model @entity72 , who at the time had gained traction in her bid for serious consideration as an actress , made herself the all - but - inevitable best actress @entity3 winner in " monster " by becoming unrecognizably fat and grotesque as serial killer @entity83			1
besides shaving her eyebrows and wearing prosthetic teeth , @entity84 had swollen her sylphlike frame by 30 pounds through heavy intakes of stuff that is bad for you , mostly doughnuts and potato chips			0
this helped make her the -- sorry about this -- heavy favorite in a field that included then - newcomer @entity98 for " @entity99 , " @entity100 for " @entity101 , " @entity102 for " @entity103 " and @entity104 for " in @entity105			0
" bear in mind , of course , that @entity84 , before and since , showed keen acting chops even when assuming her regular , blade - like countenance			0
pretty people rarely get @entity3 looking like themselves			2
@entity112 , who some believe to have been the best actor of the early sound era and beyond , only got an @entity3 years after his retirement			1
his still - indelible turns in " his girl friday " ( 1940 ) " @entity120 " ( 1946 ) and " @entity121 " ( 1963 ) went unacknowledged			0
he never let you see him act			0
maybe that was the problem			0
meanwhile , the template for physical - self - abasing - to - success was established back in 1980 when @entity126 portrayed boxer @entity127			1
in " @entity128 , " he played both the taut middleweight champ in his prime and the bloated nightclub entertainer he became			0
@entity126 packed on 60 pounds in one of the more jarring nonmechanical special effects in movie history			1
maybe he would have still won the @entity3 without going to such extremes			1
but @entity126 's efforts put him far ahead in a strong field that included career - enhancing performances by @entity139 in " @entity140 " and @entity141 in " @entity142			1
" @entity143 transformed herself into @entity144 and won the 2012 best actress @entity3 for " @entity146			2
" she thanked her makeup artists			0
another example of an actor tamping down glamor for gold came when @entity152 won best supporting actor in 2006 's " @entity154			1
" @entity152 , the exemplar of movie - star sleekness , took on facial hair and 30 pounds to play the luckless @entity159 agent @entity158			2
some observers believed the @entity3 was as much for @entity152 's good works , including his direction of that year 's critically acclaimed " @entity163 , " as for his performance			1
but the rewards for sacrificing physical beauty were acknowledged nonetheless			0
the daring does n't always work and @entity126 , again , offers an example , having shed 35 pounds and worked himself into a solitary grind as a cabbie to prepare for the role of lone gunman @entity172 in 1976 's " @entity173			2
" he was nominated , but lost to the late @entity174 as the comparably unhinged @entity175 in " @entity176			0
" among the many possible reasons for @entity126 's deferred lead - actor @entity3 honor is that , at the time , he had n't yet established an image that could be dramatically overturned or re-set in voters ' minds			1
because , more than anything else , even a better performance , @entity184 loves to see a performer overturn pre-existing expectations			1
was @entity190 's gnarled , doomed @entity189 in 1969 's " @entity191 " better than @entity193 's dyspeptic , one - eyed @entity192 in " @entity194 " that same year ? maybe , but it was an all - but - foregone conclusion going into the @entity3 ceremony that @entity193 would get the gold statuette for mucking around with his persona			2
@entity199 would , 30 years later , also be nominated for assuming @entity192 's eye - patch and ill temper in a " @entity194 " remake			0
but @entity199 ' sixth @entity3 nomination was overshadowed by finally winning best actor the year before for portraying a seedy , recidivist country - western singer in " @entity206			2
" although it was nice to see @entity199 win the prize , it seemed to many critics that @entity199 had by then submitted more than a dozen performances that were smarter , subtler and more flattering than that of a mendacious substance abuser so in need of cash that he needs to pee in a bottle while driving between gigs			0
his most iconic role , the dude in 1998 's " @entity221 , " was n't even nominated that year			0
but when an actor 's time has come as it did for @entity199 , @entity193 , @entity126 , @entity84 and others , precedents flutter noiselessly into the @entity227 ozone			2
@entity32 's time , it is widely believed , has come this year through a combination of circumstance , timing , fortune -- and crash dieting			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

best actor fave @entity32 lost 50 pounds for " @entity38 "
@entity72 became fat and unrecognizable for " monster " and won the @entity3
@entity126 played boxer thin and really fat ; @entity152 put on weight for " @entity154 "
@entity236 : @entity184 loves actors who change appearance or persona *drastically*
