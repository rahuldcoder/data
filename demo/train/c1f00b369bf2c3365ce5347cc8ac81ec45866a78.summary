-- @entity1 ensured he will remain world no. 1 next week after overcoming a titanic challenge from @entity4 to reach the @entity6 final for the fourth year in a row			1
the 10th - ranked @entity8 ended @entity10 's title defense in the quarterfinals , and seemed set to inflict another major upset after winning the opening set in convincing style			2
but last year 's runner - up @entity1 twice came from a set down to take saturday 's opening semifinal to a decider before triumphing 2 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4			1
the @entity18 will face @entity19 in monday 's final -- a rematch of their 2010 and 2011 title clashes -- after the world @entity23 beat his childhood friend @entity25 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 2 in the second semi			1
however , the @entity27 should have less fatigue to overcome before then -- he needed just two hours 21 minutes to beat the @entity30 eighth seed , while @entity1 was on court for just over four hours in a grueling contest			1
he edged @entity4 in a five - hour epic in the quarterfinals of the @entity35 in january before claiming his sixth grand slam title , but lost to @entity10 in the @entity38 final in july after being drained by a five - set semi against @entity40			1
@entity1 acknowledged that he had struggled to impose himself in the match against @entity4			1
" it was obvious @entity4 played more aggressive			2
he played better tennis , " he said			0
" i was trying to hang in there , to adjust			0
" it was tough on both of us			0
i had to run a lot			0
i had to find my rhythm			0
i was just so fortunate to play my best tennis when i needed to			2
" @entity4 said he was struggling physically with an injury picked up earlier in the @entity53 tournament , where he reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time			1
" today i had the feeling when i was still fit , when i was still healthy , i had the match in control			0
i think i was playing better than him			0
i was doing much more things than him , " the 28 - year - old told reporters			2
" but he 's not no. 1 for nothing			1
he was staying with me all the match , and at the end he pushed me , pushed me far , far , far back			0
i had to find everything i had in my body today to stay with him , and he won the match			0

world no. 1 @entity1 battles to a place in monday 's @entity6 final
