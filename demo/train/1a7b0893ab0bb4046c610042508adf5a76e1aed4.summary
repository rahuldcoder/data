the @entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 drives along a narrow stretch of road through @entity1 's @entity6			1
the sun is setting , night is coming on quickly , and @entity3 is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular			1
reptile expert @entity3 holds a @entity12 python he found in the @entity6			1
" the next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for @entity12 pythons , " he said			1
@entity3 is a state - sanctioned snake - hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles			2
the @entity6 , known as the @entity19 , has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed			1
and breed they do : the largest clutches found in the @entity6 have contained 83 eggs			1
they are also speedy travelers , able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day , experts say			0
the travel lets people like @entity3 hunt the snakes from the driver 's seat of his truck			1
but it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading			2
" it 's a large predator , and they 're eating basically everything in sight			0
that 's the problem , " @entity3 said of the @entity12 python			1
volunteers like @entity3 , happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands , are not the only troops in @entity1 's war on the invading pythons			1
a " @entity54 " was launched in the @entity51 , south of the @entity6 , by @entity52 of the @entity53			2
her program uses utility workers , wildlife officials , park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find			2
" the @entity12 pythons that are coming out of the @entity6 are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures , and we want to make sure they do n't breed here , " said @entity52 , the conservation manager for the @entity51			1
it is believed that the problem originated when reptile - breeding facilities near the @entity6 were destroyed during @entity72			1
compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners			2
" these pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem , " @entity77 spokeswoman @entity76 said			0
she said the pets , which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years , often get too big for owners to handle			0
the state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as @entity3			0
twenty years ago , no @entity12 pythons were found in the @entity6 , park statistics say			1
now , there could be 100,000 snakes in the @entity19 , but no one knows for sure			0
what @entity3 , an expert on reptiles , is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting , as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move			2
when he finds his prey , he puts the snake in a bag , deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the @entity77 , where the snake can be studied and / or destroyed			0
on one recent evening , the pickings were slim , and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two - lane @entity109 , @entity3 's crate was empty			0
he saw a python on the road , but it was dead , and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him			2
finally , @entity3 , an environmental and wildlife consultant , spotted something			0
" yeah , baby ! @entity119 ha ! look at the size of this one , " he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck			0
he got out and picked up the brownish - green snake , which immediately coiled around his arm			0
" this is n't a big one , " he said , but as he got a closer look , he did not deny that it was a good one : " at least 12 [ feet			0
] " @entity3 has a soft spot for these species , and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them			0
he says it is not the snakes ' fault that they ended up in the @entity6 , but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the @entity1 ecosystem and the need to do something			1
" one down , 100,000 to go , " he said .			0

@entity6 are perfect place for @entity12 pythons to live and breed
huge snakes breed quickly and travel quickly
