-- after a gut - wrenching collapse on the final day of the 2011 masters , questions were asked about @entity5 's mental fortitude and his ability to compete for golf 's major honors			1
but two months later , at june 's @entity10 , the @entity9 produced a resounding response to his doubters by romping to a record - breaking eight - shot victory at @entity14			1
when the eyes of the golfing world fall on @entity18 next month for the first major of 2012 , it will offer the world no. 2 a chance to reflect on how he turned a soul - crushing low into a redemptive high			1
" last year 's masters was definitely a defining moment for me , " the 22 - year - old told the @entity25 's website when asked about the tournament eventually won by @entity28 @entity27			2
can @entity32 cap comeback with @entity34 triumph ? " it could have been a crossroads in my career			2
i could have done what i did on sunday at @entity18 and let it affect me and let it get to me , and maybe go into a slump , or get down or feel sorry for myself			2
" but far from wallowing in self pity , @entity5 excelled at the next major			1
his 16 - under - par total of 268 bettered a record previously held by 14 - time championship winner @entity32 at @entity47 in 2000			1
after clinching a first major in 2011 , @entity5 reached another career landmark early in the 2012 season			1
he became the youngest world no. 1 since @entity32 with victory at @entity53 earlier this month , usurping @entity55 teammate @entity54			1
" it was a big crossroads for me in my career , " he said			0
" i was able to go down the right path and put things right by winning the next major			2
" all i wanted to do was put myself in that position again just to see if i could handle it better -- and i proved to myself that i could			0
" @entity5 admitted one of the biggest mistakes he made during the final round of last year 's masters was to become preoccupied with his rivals , rather than focusing on his own game			1
it is an error he is keen to avoid on his fourth visit to the @entity72			0
" one of the worst things i did was just trying to stay ahead of everyone else			0
instead , i maybe should have had a number in my head , like getting to 15 under			0
that way , you have a target , and that 's all you 're thinking about			0
" you 're not thinking about all these guys you 're trying to keep ahead of			0
all you 're thinking about is that target of 15 under ... you ca n't let your mind wander and start thinking about what anyone else is doing			0
" @entity54 regained the no.1 spot with victory at the recent @entity88			1
nevertheless , @entity5 's profile in the @entity90 remains high			2
partly , it is due to his contrasting experiences at the masters and then the @entity10			1
but his romance with former world no. 1 tennis ace @entity95 has also ensured he is firmly in the media spotlight			1
" it will be very different this year , " he said after of the tournament getting under way on april 5			0
" i was n't necessarily under the radar last year , but i 'll be going there with a lot more attention			0
" i 'll try to take the same approach to the tournament as i did last year			0
the week before , i 'll go up to @entity18 for a couple of days , do what i usually do " speaking about it makes me excited about going back there , and i ca n't wait for it to start now			0

@entity5 *spurned* a four - shot lead on the final day of the 2011 masters
two months later the @entity9 triumphed at the @entity10 , his first major crown
he became the youngest world no. 1 since @entity32 in 2000 earlier this month
his fellow @entity119 @entity54 has since *reclaimed* top spot in the world *rankings*
