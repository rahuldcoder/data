-- in 1974 , when @entity1 , developed an aggressive form of bone cancer that at the time few survived , his father , the late senator , wasted no time snapping into action			1
summoning a group of cancer specialists to his @entity10 home , the senator and the doctors debated well into the night how best to treat the 12 - year - old boy , according to @entity15 , author of " @entity16 : a biography			1
" sen. @entity18 and @entity19 in 1997 with his children @entity18 and @entity21 , both cancer survivors			1
the team ultimately chose an aggressive -- and risky -- course of chemotherapy			0
thirty - six years later , @entity26 is alive and cancer - free			1
when the senator 's daughter , @entity30 , was told she had lung cancer in 2002 , her father deployed a similar strategy , @entity15 says			1
doctors said @entity21 's tumor was inoperable and the 42 - year - old mother of two young children might have less than a year to live			1
but sen. @entity1 refused to accept that prognosis , and instead consulted with other experts and found a surgeon willing to operate			1
seven years later , @entity30 is also alive and cancer - free			1
if you 're thinking only @entity16 clout and @entity16 money can get that kind of care , think again			2
while you may not be able to summon medical experts from around the country to your kitchen table with the snap of your fingers , experts in patient empowerment say more and more people are carving out their own @entity16 - style health care			1
" the power that senator @entity1 had has now trickled down to all of us , who can virtually gather people in our living room , " says @entity57 , associate director of the @entity58 and co-author of a report on internet use and health information			1
according to the @entity58 report , released in june , 61 percent of @entity69 adults look online for health information			0
twenty - four percent have consulted rankings or reviews of doctors online , and 19 percent have signed up to receive updates about health or medical issues			0
many consumers are going even further , finding top experts online and boldly engaging them directly via e-mail or through social networking sites such as @entity82 or @entity83			2
" you can get quite far using your own keyboard to gather expert opinions			0
i 've heard many times over the years that doctors and surgeons are surprisingly accessible , " @entity57 says			0
" you can gather the greatest minds in science			0
" dr. @entity93 , chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the @entity96 , says he regularly receives e-mails from patients he 's never heard of -- and he returns them			1
" i think patients are very smart these days , " says the neurosurgeon , who flew in for a meeting of experts @entity1 convened last year in @entity102 to discuss options for treating his brain cancer			1
dr. @entity105 , chairman of the @entity106 at the @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , says he also returns e-mails from patients he does n't know			2
" smart people write to the top four or five major centers in the country , " he says			0
from stay - at - home mom to lung cancer expert through her own ingenuity , hard work , and determination , @entity117 received @entity1 - quality care without his power or money			1
when @entity126 ' lung cancer was diagnosed in 1998 , the 38 - year - old stay - at - home mother was told it was inoperable			1
" they gave us no hope , " her husband , dr. @entity128 remembers			0
" they told her if untreated , her illness was generally fatal in six to 12 months			2
" even with treatment , the doctors said she would n't live much longer than a year			2
like the late senator , @entity117 would n't accept a diagnosis of no hope			0
she reached out to the wife of a college friend who is a pulmonologist at @entity143 in @entity102 , who in turn referred @entity117 to dr. @entity146 , a surgeon there			0
dr. @entity146 removed her lung and chest wall lining			2
after several years the cancer recurred , this time to her liver and a rib			2
she had successful chemotherapy , but the cancer returned to her liver			2
to avoid the side effects of ongoing chemotherapy , @entity126 , a librarian by profession , then immersed herself in cancer research			1
" she read a paper about this new procedure called radiofrequency ablation , and she wrote to the doctor who did the study , and asked him for the best place to go in the @entity169 , " says @entity128 , a pediatrician in @entity161 , @entity162			2
the doctor returned her cold - call e-mail , and suggested she go @entity172 , where dr. @entity173 performed the ablation procedure			2
@entity126 continued to suffer multiple recurrences of her cancer			2
after undergoing various therapies , she consulted with dr. @entity179 , then at the @entity180 in @entity181 , whom she had met at a medical conference			0
he suggested an infusion of radioactive microspheres into her liver , another procedure she 'd never heard of , to treat the liver tumors without chemotherapy			2
@entity117 received the infusion , but had to appeal to her insurance company to get it paid for , her husband says			0
she passed away in february 2009			0
" she got 11 extra years of life because of her determination to get the best the medical establishment had to offer , " her husband says , noting that most of those years were enjoyed in good health			0
" our kids were 8 and 7 years old when she was diagnosed with lung cancer			1
they were 20 and 18 when she died			0
she got to watch them grow up to be young adults because of her own tenacity			0
" how to get @entity1 - style health care the first step to getting health care like a @entity1 is to go online and learn as much as you can about your disease , says @entity211 , co-chairman of the @entity212			1
" it used to be that in order to get medical information , you had to be a member of what people call ' the priesthood , ' " he says			0
" it was a very private and closed group that got its information through medical schools and medical societies			0
now all that 's changed because of the @entity226			1
" step two , he says , is to communicate electronically with people who have your disease			0
that 's what @entity232 did in 2007 when he was found to have kidney cancer that had spread to his brain , tongue , arms , and legs			1
" initially , doctors told me the median survival time was 24 weeks , " he says			0
like @entity1 , @entity232 could n't accept such a dismal prognosis			1
" i joined the @entity245 , and within 15 minutes of posting a question about where the best doctors were , i had an answer , " @entity211 says			0
he says the third step is to contact experts in the field , as @entity1 and @entity126 did when they were stricken with cancer			1
" @entity1 was a good role model in that he aggressively pursued finding out all the options that were available , " @entity211 says			1
" you could say he scoured the earth			0
" @entity0 's @entity256 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 's son was given *experimental* treatment for bone cancer when he was 12
when daughter @entity21 developed lung cancer , @entity1 found a doctor who 'd operate
empowered patients can get @entity1 quality care without riches or *connections*
doctor 's *advice* : do research on the @entity226 , contact experts and other patients
