-- @entity2 's glittering international career has been brought to an end after @entity5 coach @entity4 announced his fate in a pre-match television interview			1
@entity4 said the 35 - year - old @entity2 was now " a little bit old " -- ending the former @entity8 and @entity11 star 's hopes of adding to his 115 caps			1
@entity14 midfielder @entity2 had hoped to crown his @entity5 career with a fourth @entity17 finals appearance in @entity18 , but was ruled out after suffering a serious achilles tendon injury in march while on loan with @entity22 club @entity21			1
he went to @entity18 anyway as an ambassador for @entity5 's 2018 @entity17 bid and as a mentor for the team , watching the matches from the bench alongside @entity4			1
@entity2 blunder : has crass @entity4 lost the plot ? @entity2 may be fit before the end of the @entity34 @entity33 season as he has now returned to light training , but he would not be ready for @entity5 's opening @entity37 qualifiers next month			1
" i say thank you very much for helping me at the @entity17 , but probably he is a little bit old , " @entity4 told @entity39 broadcaster @entity40 ahead of @entity5 's 2 - 1 friendly win against @entity42 in @entity43 on wednesday night			1
the 64 - year - old then confirmed after the match that he had made the decision without informing @entity2			1
" did i phone him before i went on television ? no. i think i will speak with him			0
we tried to speak with him , " @entity4 said			0
" but i think @entity2 knows he has no future with the international team because we have to change			0
we have to see the new players for the future because the age is important for a lot of people , not only for @entity2			0
" i hope when @entity2 is okay he can play here the last game at @entity60 in a friendly to say goodbye and thank you very much to the crowd			2
i wo n't be picking him for any more competitive matches			0
" however , @entity2 's spokesman insisted that the player had not made any decision to end his @entity5 career , the @entity39 @entity65 reported			2
" there has been no discussion of retirement			0
he will always be available for his country -- when fit and if needed , he will be there , " the spokesman said in a statement			0
@entity2 had been tipped as a possible successor to @entity4 after the @entity22 's position was in doubt following the team 's second - round exit at the @entity17 , but he insisted he was not interested in becoming a manager			1
@entity4 , who signed a new contract before the tournament , was given a vote of confidence by the @entity86 -- and subsequently vowed to bring younger players into his squad			0
@entity2 has previously been axed by @entity4 while at @entity11 , but returned to help win the @entity90 league title before moving to the @entity34 in 2007			2
he won more international caps than any other outfield @entity5 player , but is 10 short of the country 's record held by goalkeeper @entity96			2
meanwhile , @entity5 's win over @entity42 featured another incident that highlighted the need for goal - line technology in football			1
while @entity5 midfielder @entity103 had a goal wrongly not awarded against @entity105 at the @entity17 even though it clearly crossed the line , the @entity102 were given a goal that did not appear to go completely over it at @entity60			2
debutant @entity109 had vainly attempted to clear the ball , which deflected towards the goal off his teammate @entity112 following the former 's earlier error			0
@entity5 bounced back from the 62nd - minute incident to win with two goals from captain @entity117 -- the first a dipping effort from outside the penalty area , the second a neat dink over the goalkeeper after a clever twist and turn .			0
