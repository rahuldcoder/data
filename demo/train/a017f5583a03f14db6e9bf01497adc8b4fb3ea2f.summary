@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 's new movie , " @entity10 , " is not a remake , even though @entity7 starred in a film by the same name in 1974 , the actor told @entity2			1
@entity5 plays a transit official , once demoted , in " @entity10			1
" moreover , @entity13 's character is not like the hostage negotiator he played three years ago in " @entity15 , " although the movie is about his negotiation with a deranged ex-con hostage - holder , played by @entity19 , @entity5 said			1
the updated " @entity10 " is a riveting movie about a subway dispatcher confronted by a former @entity23 trader seeking revenge -- not just a ransom , as in the 1974 film -- from the city of @entity28 for sending him to prison			1
the movie opens nationwide friday			0
it 's essentially a two - character play , with much of the dialogue delivered over a two - way radio between @entity13 , in the train control center , and @entity19 , on a hijacked train , director @entity37 said			1
the drama is paced and punctuated by a dramatic above - ground sequence , including plenty of crashes , as police rush to deliver a $ 10 million cash ransom before a deadline			0
@entity19 's character is " a contradiction of what you normally expect in a bad guy , " @entity37 said			1
" he 's funny , he 's smart , and he 's got a big heart			0
" while @entity19 , who is mourning the loss of his teenage son earlier this year , did not participate in interviews , he issued a written statement that called his character " the ultimate evil mastermind			1
" " this role as an actor gave me the chance to dispense with all moral and ethical limitations , and explore just how bad this character could really be , " @entity19 said			1
@entity5 said his character , a transit official demoted to dispatcher because he was suspected of taking a bribe , is a new twist on the familiar hostage negotiator role			1
" i was concerned a little bit about ' @entity15 ' where i was a cop and a hostage negotiator , " he said			1
" i just liked the idea when they hand him a gun that he 'd never held one before , that he was an ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation and with this cloud over his head			0
he did n't come to work knowing he was going to get an opportunity to redeem himself			0
" @entity5 , who looks younger and more fit than his character , said to prepare for the role he " ate a lot and kept getting smaller and smaller sweaters to wear			1
" @entity83 's role as @entity28 's mayor is a combination of current and former mayors -- @entity87 and @entity88			0
while he has @entity87 's @entity23 savvy , he carries himself like @entity90 on september 11 , 2001			0
@entity28 is also a major character , @entity37 said			2
many scenes were shot below ground in subway tunnels and a closed down transit station in lower @entity96 , mostly at night , @entity37 said			2
it took four weeks of tedious shooting , he said			0
" it 's just a whole other world down there , " said @entity5			1
an old train car was rebuilt to accommodate cameras and placed on a sound stage in @entity104 for scenes that could n't be shot underground , @entity37 said			0
the same person who designed the @entity108 's ( @entity109 ) high - tech control center was hired to build a replica on a sound stage in @entity104 , he said			0
@entity112 , who wrote the screenplay , revealed the secret about why he would use an older movie title for a film they do not want seen as a remake			2
since @entity120 already owned the rights to " @entity10 , " it made it an easier sell to the studio , he said			2
the original film , whose title had the number spelled out -- " @entity131 " -- was based on a best - selling 1973 novel by @entity128 , and starred @entity129 as the villain opposite @entity7			2
" the start was using that as a title , something the studio would feel comfortable making rather than just a nameless , orphan idea that you might have on your own , to try to put that together and use ' @entity141 ' as a springboard to make your own crime movie , " @entity112 said			2
ireport.com : share your review of " @entity141 " he tried to stay away from the original " @entity141 " particulars " but we had the same situation as the core , which was a hostage situation with one guy in the train with the hostages and another guy outside dealing with him over the radio			0
" putting the movie together , he said , was " a little bit like trying to pull off a heist , putting the pieces together , with a getaway car driver and a safecracker and all that stuff			0

" @entity10 " is *re-imagining* of 1974 film
@entity5 stars as @entity169 transit official negotiating with villain @entity19
@entity13 : i wanted to make the character *distinct* from negotiator in " @entity15 "
