-- the world is seeing sobering signs of climate change 's accelerating impacts , from longer , more intense droughts to stronger storms and rising seas			1
yet in contrast to the slow pace of international negotiations to combat climate change , national legislation is advancing at a startling rate , a surprise to those who ascribe to the conventional wisdom that progress has waned			1
remarkably , since 1997 , almost 500 climate - related laws have been passed in 66 countries covering around 88 % of global greenhouse gases released by human activities			2
this surprising legislative momentum is happening across all continents			0
encouragingly , this progress is being led by the big emerging and developing countries , such as @entity27 and @entity28 , that together will represent 8 billion of the projected 9 billion people on @entity30 in 2050			0
these are the key findings of the 4th edition of the @entity33 , released on thursday 27 february , the only compendium of climate legislative action created by legislators from around the world , and the most comprehensive audit yet of the extent and breadth of the emerging legislative response to climate change			1
our message is that we believe national legislation should be at the heart of a new international agreement to tackle climate change , and this study is proof it can be achieved in every country			1
while optimistic , we must also be honest			0
these laws are not yet enough to limit global average temperature rise to 2 degrees @entity54 ( 3.6 degrees @entity53 ) above pre-industrial levels , the level scientists say we must not breach if we are to avoid the worst risks of climate change			1
yet these actions are putting into place the legal frameworks necessary to measure , report , verify and manage greenhouse gas emissions -- the cause of man - made climate change			1
part of the reason for this spectacular wave of progress is changing attitudes			0
previously , the debate on climate change was framed by a narrative about sharing a global burden -- with governments naturally trying to minimize their share			1
now , however , countries are seeing mitigating climate change -- through clean energy and energy efficiency solutions -- and strengthening resilience to its impacts , as being firmly in the national interest			1
for example , 61 of the 66 countries in the @entity33 study have passed laws to promote domestic , clean sources of energy and 54 have legislated to increase energy efficiency			0
the former reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels , thereby mitigating exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices , increasing energy security and reducing energy poverty			0
the latter reduces costs and increases competitiveness			0
that 's why the first bill @entity101 senator @entity100 introduced was to do both			2
and it 's no surprise , too , that 52 out of the 66 countries covered by the study have developed legislation to improve their resilience to the impacts of climate change , some of which we are already experiencing			1
opinion : why are we still debating climate change ? as the formal @entity121 negotiations move towards @entity122 in 2015 , the scheduled conclusion of negotiations on a post- 2020 framework , this legislation is creating a strong foundation on which a post- 2020 global agreement can be built			1
moreover , it is increasingly clear that not only is the agreement in @entity122 dependent on national legislation in place in advance , implementation of the @entity122 agreement will only be effective through national laws , overseen by well - informed legislators from all sides of the political spectrum			2
a national " commitment " or " contribution " put forward at the @entity121 will only be credible -- and durable beyond the next election -- if it is backed up by national legislation , supported by cross-party legislators , that puts in place a credible set of policies and measures to ensure effective implementation			1
that is why legislators must be at the center of international negotiations and policy processes , not just on climate change , but also on the full range of sustainable development issues			2
and it is why , on climate change , governments must immediately prioritize supporting the implementation of national legislation between now and 2015			1
@entity33 members recognize this and have been at the forefront of developing the legislative response to climate change			2
in 2008 @entity164 members shaped and strengthened the @entity165			0
in 2009 , @entity167 members passed " @entity169 " legislation			0
in 2013 , members in @entity171 were instrumental in the passage of climate - related legislation showing the power of island voices			2
a comprehensive climate change law is expected to pass in @entity177 this year , and members in @entity27 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , amongst others , are developing legislation now			1
however , we need to do much more			0
and that is why , in collaboration with the @entity188 and the @entity121 , @entity33 is launching the " @entity192 " to promote the advance of climate - related laws			2
of course , the role of legislators does not end when legislation is passed			0
it is one thing to pass legislation and another to implement it			0
that is why @entity33 is equipping legislators to be as effective as possible in holding their governments to account			0
this is crucial if the agreement made in @entity122 in 2015 is to deliver			0
legislators -- with their formal responsibilities on legislation and oversight - are a fundamental part of an effective strategy to tackle the world 's environmental and sustainable development challenges			2
to maximize the chances of success , they must be at the center of all international processes and negotiations			0
success in @entity122 to create a climate agreement , the follow - through to implement the accord , and the fate of our planet depend on our actions .			1

world seeing sobering signs of climate change 's accelerating impacts , say politicians
but they argue that national legislation to limit emissions is advancing
@entity121 action on climate change will only be credible if backed up by national legislation , they say
" the fate of our planet depend on our actions , " they write
