-- over the past few weeks , politicians who have taken a hard - line stance against insurance coverage for contraception are offering a new alternative : make birth control available over the counter			1
at first glance , this appears to be a welcome shift , a reflection of the growing support for making birth control available to more women			2
when health insurance does n't cover birth control and women have to pay out of pocket at the drugstore , it wo n't expand access to birth control but shrink it			1
thanks to the @entity24 , more than 48 million women in the @entity22 are eligible for preventive care , including birth control , with no co-pay			1
we 're not just talking about the pill ; we are talking about the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the @entity31			0
that 's 48 million women who are able to go to the pharmacy or a doctor 's office and get birth control with no out - of - pocket costs			1
in the first full year of the birth control benefit , @entity22 women saved $ 483 million more ( @entity39 )			1
so when politicians who have otherwise embraced policies that would drag women back to the 1950s suggest making birth control available over the counter instead of covering it in insurance plans , they 're not experiencing a change of heart			1
they 're suggesting something that would take us back to the days when women had to pay out - of - pocket for their prescriptions , making birth control harder to get for many women , not least women who use birth control methods that simply can not be stocked on store shelves , like @entity57 , one of the most effective ( and expensive ) forms of long - acting birth control			1
offering over-the - counter birth control instead of insurance coverage for birth control amounts to a $ 483 million tax on women			1
let 's get one thing clear : more access to birth control is a good thing			2
that 's why @entity69 was founded nearly 100 years ago -- and it 's why a full range of women 's preventive care , including birth control , is now covered under the @entity24			1
@entity69 , the @entity73 and the @entity74 agree with virtually every other mainstream health care provider and expert in this country : birth control should be more available			0
@entity69 has been fighting to expand access to birth control for nearly 100 years			0
we support making it available over the counter , in addition to requiring insurance plans to cover it -- but not instead of requiring no co-pay coverage			0
women deserve both / and , not either / or			0
when @entity22 's leading doctors and scientists sat down last year to identify the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century , here 's what made the list : reducing heart disease , fluoride in drinking water , identifying the risks of tobacco , vaccines for a host of epidemics -- and birth control			0
that 's because for women , the ability to decide whether and when to have children has changed everything			0
thanks to birth control , more women are able to get an education , finish school and pursue careers			2
women are now making more money ( though we still have a ways to go on that front ) and are represented in higher numbers in the work force			0
in the decades since birth control became widely available , child mortality declined and health outcomes improved for women , infants and children			2
for women , birth control is n't a controversial topic or a political bargaining chip ; it 's basic health care , and it 's only a " social issue " if you 've never had to pay for it			1
that 's why insurance coverage for birth control is so revolutionary -- and necessary			2
let 's get one thing clear : more access to birth control is a good thing			2
back when @entity137 was figuring out what should and should n't be included as part of health reform , the nonpartisan @entity136 was asked to develop recommendations for women 's health benefits that absolutely had to be in			0
@entity143 recommended that insurance cover eight critical women 's health services , including breastfeeding counseling and supplies , hiv screening , domestic violence services -- and birth control			0
sensing a theme ? the bottom line : political proposals to make birth control available over the counter have less to do with access and more to do with the price tag , which they want women to cover out of pocket			1
we do n't have time or energy to waste on political games , not when roughly half of all pregnancies in the @entity22 are unintended and too many women still struggle to get the health care they need			0
at @entity69 , we are eager to work with anyone who has an idea that would make birth control more readily available to women			1
so to these politicians : come see us when you 're really ready to talk , and let 's see if we can come up with the next great advance in women 's health .			0

@entity177 : politicians ' push for over-the - counter birth control is not good news
*hardliners* against coverage for contraception want women to pay out of pocket , she says
she says it would make birth control less available ; things like @entity57 could n't be over counter
@entity177 : proposal , aimed at *thwarting* @entity24 , amounts to $ 483 million tax on women
