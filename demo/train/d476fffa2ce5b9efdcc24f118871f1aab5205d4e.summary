the 56 - year - old is now the owner of a brand new 2015 @entity12			1
@entity13 , who befriended @entity6 1½ years ago and has helped drive him to media interviews all week , helped pull off the surprise , suggesting they stop by a car dealership after lunch to pick up some brochures and start researching cars			1
@entity6 and @entity13 were joined by @entity21 , the college student who set up a @entity23 page on @entity6 's behalf			1

" i never thought anything i did would garner this much attention , " @entity6 said			1
after reading about @entity6 's commute in a @entity54 article that went viral , @entity21 was moved			1
like @entity6 , the 19 - year - old lives and works in two counties , so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself			1

@entity21 decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy @entity6 a car			1
" my first car cost $ 3,000 , " @entity21 said , " so i set the goal at $ 5,000			2

@entity21 said he plans to stop taking donations on sunday			2
@entity6 , in a video message posted on the @entity54 website , gave thanks			1

" @entity13 approached @entity6 , who told the financial executive his story			1
@entity13 promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him			0
" two to three months later , i saw him on a corner , " @entity13 remembered , " and i asked if he needed a ride to work			2
" @entity13 estimated he 's given @entity6 between 40 and 50 rides since then , and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship			1
the pleasure , @entity13 said , has been all his			0
" i 'm the lucky one , " @entity13 said			0
" driving him around is n't a chore , it 's a reward			0
" @entity13 said @entity6 is inspirational and funny , adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame			1
" i set our attendance standard by this man , " @entity126 , plant manager at the engineering factory where @entity6 works , told the @entity54			1
" i say , if this man can get here , walking all those miles through snow and rain , well i 'll tell you , i have people in @entity138 10 minutes away and they say they ca n't get here -- bull ! " @entity6 apparently has a perfect attendance record			1
he earns $ 10.55 an hour , not enough to save up to buy , insure and operate a car in the city , according to the newspaper			2
when the online donations rolled in , @entity6 , @entity13 and @entity21 met together for the first time this week			1
" now that [ the effort ] is so big , there 's so much more to think about , " @entity21 said			0
there are people who want to take advantage of @entity6 's newfound celebrity and his generosity , @entity13 said			1
he put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in @entity28 , a @entity157 and a certified financial planner that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves @entity6			1
" this money that is being given to him -- he earned every penny of it , " @entity21 said , just by his work ethic and his attitude			2
he 's been making the arduous 21 - mile commute between @entity167 and @entity168 since his 1988 @entity169 gave up on him , but not anymore			2
before receiving the car friday , @entity6 said the addition of a car to his life would mean a lot more sleep			2
but he loves where he works , so he has no plans to change much else			0
" i ca n't imagine not working , " @entity6 said			2
" it 's what i 've always done			0
" @entity6 , in his message , said he never expected as much support as he has received			2
