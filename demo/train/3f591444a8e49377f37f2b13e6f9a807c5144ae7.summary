-- in @entity4 , the question of who owns the wildlife has often been fraught with difficulties			1
in 1967 -- one year after the @entity8 demanded @entity7 leave @entity4 -- the ruling @entity7 apartheid government gave ownership of the local fauna to ( predominantly ) white landowners			1
shortly afterwards , the indigenous @entity4 were pushed out onto the formerly protected @entity13 wildlife reserve , where they were given a strip of land on which to farm			1
for those living on the communal lands , poaching springbok and zebra was often seen as the only way a family could stay fed. when @entity25 was a young boy , his father did what many men did at the time ; he poached			1
" he used to catch everything from springbok to lion , " recalls @entity25			0
" there was constant food in our family			0
" the practice was , of course , illegal , and the landowners often came down hard on poachers			1
" it was a very awkward situation , " says @entity25			1
" the colonial government 's department of conservation started opening up pots in the local communities to see what was in those pots			2
" though the authorities arrested perpetrators , poaching remained rampant in the 1970s and 1980s as bad droughts and a war for independence ravaged local livestock			1
as a result , many species in @entity4 were facing extinction			1
" in the private lands , wildlife was doing quite well , " notes @entity57 , head of the @entity58 ( @entity59 )			2
" on the communal lands , though , it was at near historic lows			0
" in 1983 , @entity25 's father was asked by the village headman to stop poaching			1
from now on he would no longer hunt wildlife ; he would protect it			2
he was one of the first poachers turned " game guards " , in the country			1
the novel idea -- to protect wildlife by enlisting those most skilled at tracking it -- was the brainchild of the @entity77 and @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , an ngo of which @entity25 is now the director			2
one of the founders of @entity79 , a conservationist named @entity83 , formed the idea for the game guard system in tandem with the local @entity88 herdsmen			2
" he discovered that these elders did n't want to see the end of wildlife any more than he did , " remarks @entity79 's co-founder , @entity89			1
" it might not make sense from an outside perspective , but from a local perspective , these are the men who know and enjoy being in the bush			0
but now they 're earning an income from being there			2
" when @entity4 gained independence in 1990 , the government recognized the successes achieved by the game guard system , and enlisted @entity79 's help in rolling it out on a national scale			1
by 1996 , the idea had matured ; rather than merely paying local communities to look after wildlife , the government used ownership as an incentive			1
in exchange for forming a " community conservancy " a community was given the rights to the animals on their land			1
" if people feel they really own a resource , if they feel they have responsibility for it , they 're going to be accountable , and they 're going to look after it , " notes @entity89			0
" it 's just a very logical thing			2
if you rent an apartment , you 'll treat it one way			0
if you own it , you might treat it slightly better			0
" the initial funding came from the government and @entity137 , including @entity79 and the @entity59 , who , with @entity138 , has invested $ 48 million into the conservancy program since 1993			1
looking at the numbers today , it 's clear it 's been a huge success			1
the country currently hosts the world 's largest population of free roaming cheetahs and black rhinos ( where once they teetered on the edge of extinction )			2
in the last decade , the elephant population has risen from around 13,000 to 20,000			0
in the northwest of the country , where lions were down to under two dozen , they now total roughly 130			0
the goal , though , has always been for conservancies to become self - sufficient , as owning wildlife is n't enough to ensure its protection			2
in order for the conservation scheme to really work , people on the land had to recognize they could benefit more from the animals alive than - as @entity89 says - " in their cooking pots			2
" when the conservancy system started in 1996 , there were four areas pulling in a negligible income			1
today , there are over 74 earning a combined total of more than $ 4.8 million			0
most of the money is derived from joint venture tourism , with trophy hunting following in at a distant second			2
many conservancies have used the influx of money to better develop their local schools , provide support programs for individuals with @entity187 and improve infrastructure and a range of other rural development projects			0
" it brought a very big change when we went into the tourism business , " recalls @entity191 , the manager of the @entity193 , one of the oldest in the country , and the first to become fully financially independent			1
@entity191 recalled how before @entity201 was set up , the only jobs available were in teaching and farming			0
" young people would go out to urban areas , and the elders would stay back to manage the land , " he says			2
in 1995 , the @entity210 eco-resort moved in nearby			0
at first , @entity191 says the community looked at it with suspicion			2
" we saw them as competition , " he admits			0
" they were generating an income from the resources we were living with			0
" however since then , @entity201 has become the first conservancy to partner with a private business			0
the @entity222 pays rent to the conservancy and hires locals from within the community -- one from every household			1
there are other effects of the conservancy program , some that do n't follow strict principals of conservation			1
the practice of trophy hunting has proved controversial , invoking ire from various animal rights activists			0
yet @entity57 sees it as beneficial to preservation			0
" from my perspective , we 're trying to conserve the species , not the individual animal , and this creates a benefit when it 's done in a well - regulated fashion , and the benefits go to the local community , " he says			1
another issue is that conservancies have done their job too well			0
" the numbers of zebras and elephants have increased , but so have the numbers of lions , cheetahs and hyenas , " notes @entity25			1
" it 's become a big problem for our farmers			1
" conservancies have responded in a number of ways			0
most offer a small sum to farmers to offset their losses			0
some use gps tracking devices on the predators to alert farmers when they 're heading over to their area			0
@entity191 has started a breeding station to help replace livestock that gets mauled by local predators			0
@entity25 admits that the problem is " part of the success story of @entity4 "			1
@entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity4 's land ownership issues created poaching problem until 1980s
turning poachers into *stewards* of land and wildlife *transformed* situation
numbers of big game increased and provided income for locals
community tourism and other benefits have emerged from the ' conservancy ' program
