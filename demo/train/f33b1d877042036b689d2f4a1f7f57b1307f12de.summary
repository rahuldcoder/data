@entity23 , @entity24 : a big day for democracy			2
the reason why is coming up in today 's edition of @entity0			1
first up : health care debate @entity33 : we start in @entity35 , where the release of a new proposal is giving a boost to the debate over health care reform			1
senator @entity41 , who heads up the @entity42 , unveiled a long - awaited plan yesterday after months of negotiations			2
check out some of the details : it would cost $ 856 billion over 10 years , and it would require that every @entity6 have insurance coverage by the year 2013			1
it does not include a government - run insurance program , the so - called " public option			2
" instead , it focuses on the idea of health care cooperatives , which would give coverage to members			1
this is just one of the proposals that 's been offered by lawmakers			1
you can compare some of them by checking out our home page , @entity63			2
sen. @entity41 thinks his proposal does have the best shot at getting passed			1
sen. @entity41 , ( @entity66 ) @entity67 : no @entity68 has offered his or her support at this moment			2
but i think by the time we get the final passage in this committee , you 'll find @entity68 support			2
@entity33 : that might be a challenge			2
@entity81 minority leader @entity80 said the proposal " is the wrong prescription during these tough economic times			1
" some democrats are split on the plan as well			0
one said the proposal " takes real steps to bring down the cost of health care			1
" but another argued that any plan that does n't include the public option would be considered " dead on arrival			0
" blog report @entity33 : your voices now			0
last week , we asked you after the president 's health care speech -- and the @entity68 response -- to weigh in on this debate			1
@entity103 believes that " public health care should be as much a right for every citizen as education and the ability to vote			1
" but @entity109 writes that " the money for reform would be coming out of people 's taxes , and in the end , that means we 're the ones paying for everyone else 's health care			1
" from @entity120 : " many @entity6 do n't have the money to pay for good health insurance			1
president @entity122 's address gave @entity6 an idea of how a government health plan could help alleviate the stress of dealing with insurance companies			1
" from @entity132 : " there are people out there that do n't work and do n't care if they have any health care			1
making the hard - working , middle - class people pay taxes to cover those people just is n't fair			0
" strong comments all around , y'all ! is this legit ? @entity137 , @entity24 : is this legit ? @entity139 's prime minister is usually determined by the country 's parliamentary elections			1
this one 's true ! @entity139 's constitution requires that the prime minister be in charge of the majority group in parliament			1
@entity139 's prime minister @entity33 : and since a recent election changed which party is in power , the country has a new prime minister : @entity153 , whose @entity154 of @entity139 claimed a huge victory in last month 's vote			1
this win marks the first time in nearly half a century that control of @entity139 's government is changing hands			2
@entity153 , who was officially named prime minister yesterday , promised change during his campaign			0
he says he knows he is taking on an immense responsibility			0
@entity139 's economy is coming out of its worst recession in decades			2
@entity169 @entity168 @entity33 : heading to @entity169 , where current president @entity170 appears to have won more than 54 percent of the vote in last month 's presidential election			2
we say " appears " because , while the votes have been counted , they have n't been certified , and that means the results are n't official			0
the @entity178 threw out 200,000 votes			0
and an outside group of observers says more than a million others , most of which are for @entity170 , are suspicious			0
@entity170 has criticized the outside group for making the announcement			0
he says it 's not their responsibility to address electoral complaints			2
making the vaccine @entity33 : from votes to vaccines			2
we 've reported on the government 's efforts to produce one for the @entity11 virus and this week 's news that it should be ready sooner than expected			1
however , the @entity6 is n't the only country preparing to fight a potential outbreak			1
a lab in @entity9 is already developing doses of the @entity11 vaccine			1
@entity204 takes us through the process			0
( @entity206 ) @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 : this is @entity211 headquarters , the first company in the world to successfully complete clinical trials for an @entity11 vaccine			1
they 've taken our temperatures , we 've been asked to wear these lab coats and shoe covers , and we 're going to go into the production line and see exactly how this vaccine is made			2
this is the very first stage of the process			0
every day , tens of thousands of fertilized eggs come in			0
they 're incubated for a certain period time , then they are inspected , and then they are infected with the @entity11 virus			1
after three more days , the virus is then extracted and used to make the vaccine			2
all of the infected eggs come in on a conveyer belt			0
they are sliced open and then the virus is harvested			0
the virus is then rendered inactive and stored for the next part of the process			0
inside all these jugs is the @entity11 virus			1
at this stage , they 're collecting the virus and preparing it for purification			0
and here is the final product			0
inside this vial is a vaccine for the @entity11 virus			1
it 's a one - time vaccine			1
and right here , they are being bottled and labeled and boxed			0
all of the vaccines will be sent in refrigrerated trucks across @entity9 to fulfill government orders			1
they do need to be kept at a certain temperature , between two and eight degrees @entity250			0
so far , millions of vaccines have been ordered , and there 's more on the way			2
@entity204 , @entity0 , @entity209			0
( @entity254 ) @entity255 @entity256 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity259 's @entity6 government class at @entity260 in @entity261 , @entity262 ! about how many people live in the @entity6 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) 276 million , b ) 307 million , c ) 368 million or @entity270 ) 412 million ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! there are an estimated 307 million people living in the @entity6 that 's your answer and that 's your @entity257 ! facebook @entity33 : believe it or not , that 's about the same number of people who are on @entity275 ... give or take a few million			1
holy cow ! the social networking site announced that it crossed the 300 million mark this week			0
it added that about 70 percent of those users actually live outside the @entity6 even bigger news : @entity275 has turned a profit for the first time in the company 's history			1
it did n't expect to do that until 2010			0
pretty impressive for a web site that started out just for college students			0
promo @entity33 : we 're not up to 300 million fans -- yet -- but our @entity275 page is growing , and it 's all thanks to you			2
if you have n't had a chance to stop by recently , head to @entity275 / cnnstudentnews			0
@entity302 @entity33 : " @entity303			0
" simple words , but they 're the start of one of the most important documents in @entity6 history : the @entity6 @entity16			1
who can be elected to office , how laws are made , what rights we have as citizens : this thing is basically the guidebook for our government			0
and today is its birthday			0
to celebrate , we 're giving a pop quiz			0
( @entity206 ) @entity33 : the @entity6 @entity16 turns 222 today , so we should all know it pretty well by now			1
let 's find out just how well ! first up : which part of the @entity16 gives all lawmaking powers to @entity324 ? @entity325 , section i ; the @entity328 ; @entity330 , section i or the @entity331 ? it 's the first section of the first article that gives legislative powers to @entity324 and establishes the @entity42 and the @entity81			1
here 's another shot : what 's the minimum age of the @entity6 president ? 21 , 26 , 30 , 35 ? @entity325 , @entity339 says you 've got to be at least 35 years old			1
who has the power to set and collect income taxes ? the president , the @entity345 , the @entity346 , @entity324 ? it was the 16th amendment that gave @entity324 the power to tax , though those taxes were a lot less when that amendment was ratified than they are today			0
when does the @entity16 say that court judges will hold their offices ? after working as lawyers , during good behavior , while in good health , in even - numbered years ? @entity358 , section 1 says that court judges " shall hold their offices during good behavior			1
" okay , last one ! which of these phrases does n't actually appear in the @entity363 : " separation of church and state , " " cruel and unusual punishments , " " unreasonable searches and seizures , " " right to a speedy and public trial " ? the phrase " separation of church and state " does n't appear in the @entity16 ; it was how @entity370 described the @entity371			1
that completes your @entity373 ! before we go @entity33 : but it does n't complete our coverage ! @entity377 to @entity63 to check out our constitution day learning activity			0
finally today , go fly a kite			0
that 's what these guys did			2

the event was open to all ages , obviously			0
organizers say more than 2,500 people showed up to help set the new mark for the most kites in the air at one time			0
