that 's not in dispute , but according to attorneys ' opening statements thursday in @entity0 's murder trial , almost everything else is			1
assistant state attorney @entity8 , speaking for the prosecution , painted a picture of four innocent teens who stopped at a @entity13 , @entity14 , gas station for gum and cigarettes amid a day of " mall hopping and girl shopping " over @entity20 break in 2012			2
@entity0 asked the teens to turn down their music , and @entity1 disrespected him , saying " f * * * that n * * * * r " -- nothing more -- and for that , @entity0 opened fire , hitting @entity1 three times			1
it was a markedly different account from that of defense attorney @entity30 , who told jurors that the music was so loud , it was rattling the windows of the teens ' suv , and when @entity0 politely asked one of them to turn it down , @entity1 uttered the three - word explicit phrase , demanded his pal turn the music back up and began jawing with @entity0			1
@entity1 then produced a weapon -- either a gun or a lead pipe , @entity30 alleged -- and told @entity0 , " i 'm going to f * * * ing kill you , " the attorney said			1
he added , " you 're dead , bitch			0
this is going down now , " the attorney alleged			0
while @entity8 said @entity1 and @entity0 " exchanged f - bombs back and forth , " @entity30 said his client never uttered a curse word			1
and while @entity8 cited witnesses who said an incensed @entity0 began shooting after telling @entity1 , " you 're not going to talk to me like that , " @entity30 insisted that @entity1 was getting out of the car , armed , with the intention of hurting or killing @entity0			1
" the first person to get upset , and the only person to curse was @entity1 , " @entity30 said , adding that one of the teens with @entity60 , @entity61 , initially told police @entity1 was getting out of the car when the shots rang out			1
four days later , @entity30 said , the teens claimed driver @entity69 had the child locks activated , preventing @entity60 from getting out			0
" you know why he did n't duck ? he was getting out of the car with a weapon , " @entity30 said			1
the shooting @entity0 initially fired three times into @entity1 's door , which @entity8 said was closed , a bullet landing in each of @entity60 's legs while a third bullet traveled through his liver , lungs and aorta			1
a " terrified " @entity85 backed up , " but the defendant did n't stop			0
he kept focus and aimed at the car , " firing four more times , @entity8 said			0
@entity0 then opened the door of his @entity92 , swung his legs out of the car and fired three more times , the prosecutor said			2
one bullet went through the back window of @entity98 ' @entity97 and landed in the visor just above his head , @entity8 said			0
police reports have indicated that the teens were unarmed , and a police interrogator told @entity0 the day after the november 2012 shooting that the teens did n't have a chance to ditch any weapon because they never left the gas station parking lot			1
@entity0 repeatedly said he feared for his life and saw either a shotgun barrel or a stick in the teens ' suv before he began shooting			1
when police searched the car , @entity8 said , they found a basketball , basketball shoes , some clothing , a camera tripod and cups on the floor but " no weapons			0
" this promises to be a bone of contention in the case , as @entity30 told jurors that not only did the teens leave the gas station parking lot , they stopped in an adjacent lot about 100 yards away before returning and asking someone to call 911			0
they had " ample time to get rid of a firearm or pipe , " @entity30 said			0
also , @entity30 said , the witnesses can not account for two of the teens ' whereabouts immediately after the shooting , and two witnesses initially told police the teens appeared to be " stashing " something			2
no weapon was found because the police did not secure the parking lot to conduct a proper search , @entity30 said , and it was days before authorities looked in the nearby bushes and dumpsters			2
though it does n't appear to be a factor in the case , @entity60 did have a knife in his pocket			0
@entity8 classified it as a " pocket knife , " a description with which @entity30 took issue , saying it was a tactical knife with a 4 - inch blade			0
" it 's not a @entity168 knife with a toothpick and scissors , " he said			0
the aftermath what happened immediately after the shooting is also arguable , to hear the attorneys tell it			0
@entity0 and his girlfriend , @entity1 , drove 40 miles south to @entity176 , where they had reservations at a bed and breakfast			1
once there , @entity8 said , @entity0 ordered pizza , " took his little dog for a walk , " ordered a movie and " poured a big , tall drink -- rum and @entity189			2
" " they had cell phones , but they did n't call 911			0
he did n't drive to a police substation , " @entity8 said			2
" that defendant put his head on his hotel pillow and went to sleep			0
" in the morning , @entity1 saw a news report about a shooting at a @entity13 gas station , in which a 17 - year - old had been killed , and rather than call police , the couple packed their bags and drove 130 miles home to @entity205 , where @entity0 was finally apprehended			1
@entity0 " was waiting till we get around people we know " to call authorities , and he wanted to ensure " our dog and everybody were where they needed to be			2
i did not want to bring a s * * tstorm down on them in @entity13 , " he told interrogators the day after the shooting			0
@entity30 added that it was n't @entity0 who ordered pizza , but @entity1 , who was nervous meeting @entity0 's family for the first time that day			1
she had n't eaten much at @entity0 's son 's wedding and ordered the pizza because she was hungry , @entity30 said			1
" she 's the one who watched the movie to put herself to sleep , " the defense attorney said			0
@entity229 is also to blame for the couple traveling home the next morning , he said			0
she was " petrified " and " did n't know the law of self - defense " and begged @entity0 to take her back to @entity205 , @entity30 said			1
he said , she said witness credibility promises to be an issue as well , as the driver of teens ' car , @entity69 , was on probation and violating curfew at the time of the shooting			0
also , @entity30 said , the witness who reported @entity0 's license plate to police is in prison and tried to leverage his testimony in @entity0 's trial for a lighter sentence			1
@entity0 has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and three counts of attempted first - degree murder			1
between iffy witnesses and what @entity30 called a shoddy investigation , the evidence will show that @entity0 's actions were lawful and justified , the defense attorney said			1
had @entity0 not been armed , he might have been the victim that evening , @entity30 said			1
" @entity260 did n't make all men equal			0
@entity262 is a firearm , " @entity30 said			0
" ( @entity0 ) had every right under the law to not be a victim , to be judged by 12 rather than carried by six			2
" the prosecution unsurprisingly has a different take			0
@entity8 said @entity0 was simply incensed by the heavy bass coming from a nearby car -- even telling @entity1 before she went to buy wine and chips , " i hate this music " -- and he began shooting when a teen defiantly took issue with being told what to do			1
" @entity1 was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands , " @entity8 told the jury			2
" @entity1 pointed a semiautomatic pistol at four unarmed kids at a distance much closer than you and i. " @entity287 , an attorney for the @entity1 family , told @entity289 he expects a quick trial , over before february 14 , two days before what would have been @entity1 ' 19th birthday .			2

opening statements paint *starkly* different pictures of what led to @entity1 ' killing
@entity0 has pleaded not guilty to murder , three counts of attempted murder
the *confrontation* started when @entity0 asked a group of teens to turn down their music
defense insists @entity1 *brandished* weapon ; police , prosecutors say he was n't armed
