-- could motorsports become a major industry in football - obsessed @entity3 ? it will be if one @entity3 businessman has his way			2
@entity9 - based entrepreneur @entity8 has entered his country into the lavish and highly - competitive world of car racing and has ambitious plans to drive @entity15 motorsport and build a multi-million dollar racing industry on the continent			1
called @entity3 @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , the team says it hopes to compete at major motor racing events over the next few months , including the @entity23 series and sports car endurance races			1
" my philosophy is whatever i want to do , i go for the best , " @entity8 , team principal and owner of @entity20 said monday , moments after unveiling a green and silver @entity27 as the team 's car at the @entity31 , a @entity33 exhibition site designed to highlight the continent 's cultural , artistic and sport assets			1
@entity8 says his team will proudly " fly the flag of @entity31 , " being the first @entity3 racing team to represent the continent at world motorsports			1
" the idea of a racing team called @entity3 @entity19 is to use @entity15 drivers and gradually develop @entity15 mechanics and engineers , " he says			1
" in the motorsport community i 've been asked so many times , ' oh what if they are no good , ' or ' you might be , maybe , the last on the grid , ' and i say ' yes , i do n't care , let 's be the last on the grid but we are developing , we are growing , ' so that 's our main goal for this project			0

but he soon turned his passion into business and in 2007 he set up a racing company called @entity68			0
@entity8 initially put together a racing side to compete as " @entity70 " at the @entity71 of @entity68			2
but right before he was about to realize his dream , the @entity71 series went bankrupt			0
determined @entity8 devoted further time and money to create @entity20			0
he says his business venture has been solely financed by himself and a few friends who had faith in his vision			0
" the biggest challenge is people believing in my dream , " he says			0
" i found out that people struggle to understand and most people never can imagine that motorsport can come to @entity31 or to @entity3			0
" @entity8 , who recently appointed veteran @entity87 motorsport executive @entity86 as team manager , says that right now there is a " 50 - 50 " chance for @entity20 to be ready for the @entity23 race in @entity92 in early september			2
yet , for @entity8 and his team , competing at the international motorsport arena is only one part of their goal			2
" one of the key pillars of this project is not just about putting together a racing team -- it 's about introducing motorsport to @entity31 and that means we have to create circuits , we have to create series and , most importantly , we have to create drivers , " says @entity98 , @entity20 's lead driver			2
as a result , @entity68 is looking to develop a racing championship in @entity3 and is also setting up a domestic academy to develop young drivers and prepare them to compete at the global stage			1
it has also teamed up with @entity115 , a @entity87 - based sports car manufacturer , to create a development center to train young mechanics and engineers in the @entity15 country			1
more from @entity121 : ' @entity120 ' brings @entity122 to world in addition , @entity8 says he 's partnered with local authorities in @entity126 to develop a " @entity132 - style " circuit on the streets of the city 's marina to host an international motorsport grand prix			1
" that one to me is so exciting , " says @entity8 , adding that motorsport presents @entity3 with a huge business , marketing and networking potential that can create career opportunities for the country 's youth and also attract foreign investors			1
" motorsport is the richest sport in the world -- it 's a multi-billion dollar economy , so why do n't we also tap into it			0
" @entity98 says that apart from @entity149 , where there is a " reasonably good domestic scene of mostly white drivers , " and some racing events held in @entity154 , " there 's not really any motorsport in @entity31			1
" " we want to prove to the rest of @entity31 that this is a major sport and to be honest everybody knows , @entity3 , @entity15 men love their cars			0
" @entity8 believes @entity3 can emulate the successful example of @entity87 cycling -- which has become an international tour de force in recent years -- and dominate the world of motorsport in the future			2
" in 10 years i 'd be incredibly disappointed if we did n't have a @entity167 driver and i 'd be very disappointed if we did n't have a @entity167 driver who is winning races , " added @entity98 .			0
