@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's hard not to stand in complete awe of everything the @entity6 has to offer when you 're in the middle of @entity0			1
its most famous geyser , @entity11 , shoots up into the sky as crowds tilt their heads just to see how high it really can go			2
the saturated blues and greens of geothermal pools appear to be otherworldly			2
towering mountains wrap themselves around the park , providing shelter for wild animals to roam			0
but below the beauty of @entity0 , is a volcano powerful enough devastate most of the @entity25 and change the entire world			1
" @entity0 and other volcanoes around the world are called supervolcanoes and the reason is they 're like a super sized drink			1
it means it 's just big , " says @entity32 , a geologist at @entity0 in the @entity25 state of @entity1			1
@entity35 describes a geological phenomenon never witnessed by man			1
supervolcanoes are off the charts big when comparing them to a normal volcanic eruption			0
on may 18 , 1980 , @entity41 in the northwest corner of the @entity25 erupted			0
it killed 57 people and expelled one cubic kilometer of ash			2
the first @entity0 supervolcanic eruption 2.1 million years ago was at least 25,000 times larger than the @entity41 eruption			1
two other @entity0 super eruptions 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago , though smaller than the first one , would still dwarf any normal volcanic eruption			1
you can monitor @entity0 activity few would expect the tranquil national park would actually be sitting on the mouth of a sleeping giant			1
the physical characteristic of a supervolcano is n't a typical cone - shaped mountainous peak			2
instead , supervolcanoes have what are called calderas			0
these are vast sunken areas that are formed after previous super eruptions as the ground was blown out and fell back to rest			1
geophysicist @entity68 first called @entity0 a " living breathing caldera " in 1979			1
he now heads the @entity70 at the @entity71			0
" @entity0 has been very important			1
it 's my laboratory , " says @entity68			0
he sees @entity0 as more than a supervolcano , in fact he does n't even like that term			1
" i prefer to use the term hotspot because it reflects a zone of concentrated and active volcanism			0
" @entity79 and @entity80 are other examples of hot spots , but @entity0 is the only hot spot located underneath land rather than sea which has made it easier for @entity68 to study			1
his team has setup a series of different sensors around the park so that they can keep a close eye on its vital signs			0
they measure ground movement and record the frequent earthquakes that occur in the area			0
the sensors have also helped @entity68 's team figure out what they were dealing with			0
as little as eight kilometers below the surface is a shallow reservoir of solid rock and magma			0
and below the reservoir is an enormous 57,000 - cubic - kilometer plume of very hot rock , the fuel behind every bubbling pool and geyser in @entity0			1
with all of this heat just sitting , waiting beneath @entity0 , what exactly would it look like if it were all to blow ? @entity68 and other scientists all have scenarios and every one is bleak			1
in @entity68 's book , " windows into the @entity6 , " he says , " devastation would be complete and incomprehensible			0
" before the super eruption , large earthquakes would likely swarm the surrounding areas until the huge blast that would erase @entity0 completely off the map			2
after the initial eruption , clouds of gas and rock would burn everything in its path with temperatures reaching to hundreds of degrees @entity130			0
@entity131 would cover the western @entity25 and also enter the jet stream with the potential to cripple air transportation and threaten the world 's food supply			0
there are some estimates that 87,000 people would die immediately			1
you can imagine that with this kind of catastrophe on the line , the question @entity68 gets asked the most is , " when is going to blow next ? " the three @entity0 super eruptions have occurred about 800,000 years apart , so people have started to speculate that another one is due			1
also , in 2004 @entity68 noticed that the ground had started to rise then lowered again in 2010			0
it was like the supervolcano was breathing			2
however , @entity68 says there is absolutely no need to panic			0
we know roughly what to expect of the patterns of time and space of the earthquakes ground information			2
again , acquired from other experiences around the world			0
we use that to interpret our own data in terms of what the potential threat or risk might be , " says @entity68			0
for him , the more immediate threat is earthquakes and smaller eruptions since the probability of one of those instances occurring is much higher			2
whether that may be comforting or not , millions of visitors will still make their way each year to the geological wonderland that is @entity0			1
physicist @entity179 on supervolcano : ' all you can do is run '			2

underneath the natural beauty of @entity0 is a geological time bomb
a supervolcano whose previous eruptions were larger than anything seen by man
if it erupts some estimates put the immediate death toll at about 87,000 people
three eruptions occurred about 800,000 years apart ; people are speculating another one is due
