-- remote and wild , the windswept island of @entity2 off @entity4 's @entity3 offers @entity7 history , stunning rocky landscapes and warm , welcoming locals			1
ireporter @entity10 , from @entity12 in the @entity4 province of @entity14 , recently traveled to @entity2 as part of a travel quest			1
" my goal is to visit all the @entity4 provinces on the premise that even though i love to travel to other countries , i should also know my own country too			1
so , after the @entity2 trip , i only have one more province to go ! " she said			1
the large island , which is part of @entity4 's easternmost province , @entity2 and @entity27 , even has its own time zone -- a half - hour ahead of neighbors to the west			1
@entity10 , 63 , made the trip to @entity2 with her sister - in - law , @entity32			1
they two took a 12 - day bus tour from @entity35 in the northwest , along the @entity37 and then south along the east coast to @entity39 's			2
the tour was operated by @entity41 , a local company			2
" our tour escort was a retired school principal who was just a fountain of information about the history , the people and the culture of the province , " @entity10 said			1
@entity10 answered the following questions about her trip : favorite spots that is a tough one to answer since we visited so many wonderful places			0
i 'll give two places : @entity39 's , the capital city , because it 's so different from most @entity62 cities , and @entity63 , a small fishing village on the @entity37 , which has the most fabulous tapestry i 've seen outside of @entity66			0
do n't - miss experience do n't miss the chance to hear the locals perform ! at almost every stop , local fiddlers and singers performed their own music			1
at times , it was toe - tapping dances or sea shanties ; at other times , sad ballads that brought a tear to the eye			0
share your travel experiences on @entity85 : just back from first impression i was amazed by how rugged the landscape was and how close the sea was to every community			0
it 's obvious that this harsh environment has helped to shape a tough and resilient people			1
lasting memory i will always remember the friendliness of the people			0
they were courteous yet funny , helpful but proud			0
three adjectives that capture this place scenic , rugged , resilient biggest surprise the amazing history -- from @entity103 , to explorers , to current - day oil rigs off the coast			0
most delicious food , drink or place to eat maybe not most delicious , but most notable is the local rum , @entity111			0
if you go to @entity2 , you have to be screeched in ! most meals featured fish , and the featured fish there is cod. we had wonderful fish chowders and fish cakes			2
@entity3 salmon was also very good			2
check out @entity10 's photos above for more on the places she visited			0
