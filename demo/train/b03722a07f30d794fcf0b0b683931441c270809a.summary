@entity0 , @entity1 -- every working night for the past 34 years , @entity3 has watched from his control room as tankers , ships and barges glide across the crisp waters of @entity0 's @entity9			1
the picturesque @entity1 city -- built under the @entity12 reign of @entity13 and popularly known as the " @entity14 " -- is spread across a cluster of islands connected by more than 300 bridges			1
some are vital traffic arteries , others are simple foot - crossings , while a special few are drawbridges that rise in the evening to let ships pass to and from the nearby @entity24			1
as custodian of the iconic @entity26 , @entity3 is responsible for maritime access into and out of the city 's myriad canals and waterways -- but he 's not alone in this endeavor			1
among the others clearing the way along the river are @entity3 's wife , @entity36 , and two sons			1

@entity3 was allocated a job at the @entity26 in 1979 by the then @entity52 authorities after graduating from high school			1
two years later his wife began working at the nearby @entity46 as a mechanic			2
the next generation of @entity3 's family were always likely to follow their parents having spent much of their youth playing in and around the drawbridges while their parents worked			1
" as the children from their small age ... i would bring them , and show where i work			0
later on as they finished the school , graduated from the institute they wanted themselves to start working here , " he said			0
the thickly moustachioed @entity3 is evidently proud of what has become his family 's unusual dynasty and chuckles at the mention of locations under their " control			2
" ensuring @entity0 's drawbridges operate at their optimum level , however , is no easy feat. see also : what happens to goods lost at sea ? currents are often strong and some of the cargo passing ships carry can be hazardous			1
any lapses of communication between bridges -- which must rise one after the other -- can mean ships stranded in dangerous waters			0
at the height of summer , as many as 40 commercial vessels can pass into and out of the city in a single night			0
according to local industry website , @entity97 , more than 9 million tons of freight moves along the @entity9 between may and november alone ( before the water freezes over during @entity1 's bitter winter months )			1
fortunately , modern technology has made things much easier for the @entity3 family in this regard			2
the creaking old mechanical equipment of days gone by has been replaced with fully computerized systems			0
" one can do it all by just touching the screen " @entity3 said			2
" earlier , most things were observed visually			0
now we can see it all through the indicators , " he added pointing to his futuristic looking work station			0

@entity0 itself has morphed into a modern , cosmopolitan city			1
at the heart of that transformation is the city 's waterfront			0
today tourists flock to see the bridges , islands and sights so vividly described by giants of @entity1 literature like @entity129			2
residents meanwhile take pride in the unique architecture and historic significance of their city			0
" the bridges are the symbol of @entity0 , " @entity3 said			1
" many people come here to observe how it takes place , this wonder of the drawing of the bridges			0
during the white nights there are so many people on the embankment			0
" " this work is a subject of pride			0
some people watch me at the tv screen ( and ) they say ' oh , we have seen you -- it is so great , well done			0
' " it seems likely this sense of goodwill will be felt by the @entity3 family for many generations to come .			2

@entity3 has operated the @entity26 in @entity0 for 34 years
his wife and two sons also operate drawbridges in the picturesque @entity1 city
drawbridge operators play a vital role in ensuring the smooth passage of maritime traffic along the @entity9
