-- when the roman emperor @entity2 came to power in @entity4 he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams			1
a massive bust of @entity2 's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the @entity11			1
one of his first acts was to pull the troops out of @entity19 , modern - day @entity12 , a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the @entity11 " s superb exhibition " @entity2 : @entity20 " which opens on 24 july under the imposing classical dome of the @entity22			1
curator @entity23 says : " no matter what our take is on the conflict in @entity12 today , we can relate to @entity2 's decision			1
maybe 10 or 15 years ago , it would n't have mattered so much			2
" @entity2 was born in @entity31 to a noble family whose origins lay in @entity34			1
one of the greatest of @entity31 's emperors , he consolidated imperial power , was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands			1
though married , he also took a homosexual lover , @entity41 , whose drowning in the river @entity44 on the very day @entity42 were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god @entity48 remains one of ancient history 's great unsolved mysteries			1
the range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well - attended			1
visitors will , for example , be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at @entity61 in central @entity62 and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high			1
" a year ago , this was still lying buried in the ground , " says @entity23			1
" it " s proof that @entity68 history is n't done and dusted ; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it			2
" the exhibition brings together 180 objects , from 31 sources in 11 different countries			1
" it has n't been an easy thing to do , " adds @entity23			2
" many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate			1
this is n't an exhibition that can travel			2
people will only be able to view it for these three months			2
" many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into @entity2 's reign			1
between 132ad and 135/6ad the @entity90 of @entity91 rebelled against @entity68 rule			2
some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert , called the cave of letters , in which they were trapped by @entity68 troops			0
few made it out alive			0
the climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition			0
there is a letter written by @entity90 leader @entity107 ( enquiring about a delivery of supplies ) , as well as mirrors , a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate , probably made in @entity113 , that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave			0
then there are three house keys , their wooden handles preserved , looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made			0
@entity23 says : " they " re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they " d be back in a week or two , but of course they were n't -- they all perished			0
and there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in			0
it " s a potent symbol of conflict			0
" to the @entity138 will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern @entity140 , an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6km			0
in schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north , but it was n't necessarily so			0
" the wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes , " says @entity23			0
confirmation of this , perhaps , comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of @entity158 , the oldest surviving hand - written documents in the @entity161			0
in one an officer , presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post , derides the locals as the " little @entity161 , " not worthy of worrying about very much - brief , battered and faded the letter may be , but as an example of high - handed imperialism it is hard to beat			0
