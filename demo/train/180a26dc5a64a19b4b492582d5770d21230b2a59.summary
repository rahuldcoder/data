@entity0 -- @entity0 mayor @entity2 found himself facing questions thursday about why the city was paying for more than 100 vacant hotel rooms when thousands were displaced after @entity7			1
the rooms were reserved for storm victims who were pushed out of their homes by @entity7 , which hit the area october 29			1
according to @entity2 's office , a total of 1,014 people were housed in 416 rooms , while another 120 rooms designated as emergency housing were vacant			1
" we 've gone out and we 've gotten housing for people in case they might need it , but the wonderful thing is we have n't needed it so far , " @entity2 said thursday			1
" we have hotel rooms in advance , particularly now because as you get toward the holiday season the hotel occupancy goes up , and if we need it -- and i hope we do n't -- we 're going to have those , " he added			1
that 's a surprise to @entity34 , whose whose apartment in the @entity37 neighborhood of @entity38 has n't had heat or power since the storm hit			1
" i would go to the hotel , " @entity42 told @entity1 on thursday			1
" it 's freezing in my apartment			0
i got to wear four pairs of socks every day			0
" @entity48 , president of the @entity49 , said scores of families are staying in cold , dark homes because they are concerned about looting or they do n't want to pull their children from school			0
" we believe strongly the minute that first snow hits , and it 's really cold , these people are going to need housing , " @entity48 said			2
" it 's a very prudent move on apart of the city to have as much temporary housing as possible			0
" the city says canvassers have knocked on more than 12,600 doors to tell people that housing assistance is available for those who still lack heat , and they leave flyers on the doors of units where no one answers			0
residents are being told about restoration centers where they can be connected with hotels if their heat is still out			0
@entity7 victims outraged over business - as - usual power bills @entity42 said she had not been contacted about the available hotel rooms			1
she has been staying with her mother in a crowded @entity85 apartment while she awaits repairs to her apartment , where she said the walls are caving in and mold is growing on the walls			0
she said the @entity91 has given her $ 1,700 and that the city took over responsibility for the housing complex she lived in because the landlord abandoned it			1
" that 's why i am so mad , " she said			0
" we still do n't have lights			0
" @entity2 's office said the city expects @entity91 to reimburse it for the hotel rooms			1
@entity91 spokesman @entity104 told @entity1 that the agency would consider that , provided the city could provide some justification for the costs			1
as of wednesday , 473,785 households in @entity0 and @entity110 had applied for disaster relief assistance with @entity91			1
while not all of the families were requesting housing assistance , officials said they continue to work with state and local officials to help all victims of the deadly storm			2
meanwhile , the agency started exploring the possibility of housing some displaced residents on boats , posting a request for information in hopes of finding rapid , cost - effective housing options on small vessels			2
opinion : let 's not forget superstorm victims @entity91 said the purpose of the request was for market research only and to explore whether the maritime industry could offer viable options for residents who remain homeless			2
officials said the vessels they requested ideally would sleep two to six adults , either as stand - alone boats or interconnected to create a single dwelling made of multiple units			0
the request for information specifically said the agency is n't looking for cruise ships as a solution to the crisis caused by the colossal storm that pounded the @entity151 last month			0
@entity91 faced criticism from residents and politicians for its decision to house first responders and emergency personnel on cruise ships docked in @entity159 and other cities after @entity161			2
@entity7 slammed ashore near @entity162 , @entity110 after forming in the @entity163 and sweeping northward , killing a total of 182 people from @entity166 to @entity167			0
it caused widespread flooding and damage and destroyed or damaged more than 30,000 homes and businesses in @entity110 alone , state officials said			0
@entity110 gov. @entity174 said the latest estimates of @entity7 - related storm costs in his state were $ 36.8 billion , while @entity0 gov. @entity178 told reporters earlier this week the total cost in his state was $ 41 billion .			2
