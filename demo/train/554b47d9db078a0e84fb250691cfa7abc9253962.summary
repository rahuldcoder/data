i once uploaded an @entity1 of me at @entity2 trying to get all kissy - face with a mannequin			1
at the time it seemed like a good idea , but she was rather unresponsive			2
probably just not into gingers			2
it was a silly moment , for sure , but it also accurately illustrated my overall artistic contribution to the world of social photo sharing			0
which is to say : little to none			0
" hey , what filter looks best for an @entity17 ticket stub ? " real @entity19 kind of stuff			0
finally , about two months ago , i took a short break from @entity1			1
my farewell offering was a three - second video where i simply exclaimed , " @entity25 , que lastima ! " translation : " oh , what a shame			2
" but it was n't			0
i was using @entity1 for all the wrong reasons			1
however , recently , a new account started catching everyone 's attention for all the right reasons			1
because , unlike my periodic visual odes to my dog 's butt , everything about grandmabetty33 is wonderful			0
it all started about three months ago when 18 - year - old @entity43 , a high school senior in @entity44 , @entity45 , decided to start documenting the final days , months , and ( hopefully ) years of his great - grandmother , @entity46			1
she was diagnosed in december			0
" many of my friends knew @entity47 , " @entity43 told me			1
" and it was a neat way to connect her to them			0
" amazingly , after about a week , @entity47 had nearly 100 followers			1
and because she 's pretty much the cutest thing walking the planet -- sorry , sloths -- her account quickly caught on even more with people who had never even met her			2
one of @entity47 's biggest fans is the musician @entity62			1
@entity43 says they were amazed when she went over 1,000 followers , but when she reached 4,400 , somehow that seemed to be the magic number			1
" i 'll never forget that number , " @entity43 says			1
" that 's when it kicked off			0
" soon , they were on tv			0
soon , @entity73 's phone started ringing off the hook			1
soon , they had no idea what they were getting themselves into			0
and soon , @entity47 's account began growing by the thousands			1
at press time she had more than 350,000 followers			2
of course , with great fame comes great responsibility			2
@entity47 had to become more tech savvy			1
there are rules to internet stardom , and the first one is that you take your own selfies			0
@entity43 admits , " teaching her how to take a selfie is harder than it probably seems			1
" but @entity47 's getting it , and , more importantly , she gets @entity1			1
@entity43 says , " she knows that i post her pictures and videos on the @entity100 , people like them , and every time we get the chance , we sit down for a couple hours and just read the heartwarming comments she receives everyday			1
" but never mind the comments			0
@entity47 had to get a @entity107			1
on saturday , @entity73 opened one for his great - grandma , and four days later she got her first letter from a fan in @entity112			1
because , you know , that 's what @entity115 do			0
then , on thursday , she got 20 additional letters and a package with a handmade lap quilt			0
sometimes they 're just really good			0
but all this is about more than just some old lady making duck faces and peace signs for the amusement of strangers on the @entity100			1
this is about two people -- generations apart -- finding a creative , 21st - century extension to a close bond that was built over many years			2
@entity43 explains , " before grade school , i did n't have a babysitter			1
we 're so undeniably close , and i would hate to lose her			0
she thinks the same of me and my family -- she tells us every day			0
" but sometimes she just sticks out her tongue			0
like she did when she was visiting the " cancer doctor " and was eating blue candy			2
and now that image has become the official @entity47 logo thanks to a company called 1facewatch who designed it for her based on the photo			2
so , @entity47 has a logo , and fans just keep pouring in			2
@entity43 admits , " @entity47 loves @entity1 arguably even more than i do			1
it gives her something to look forward to			0
you never know what you 're gon na get with her			0
" which is far more than i can say for myself			0
i 'm recently back on @entity1 , and it 's pretty much just more photos of my dog 's butt			2
@entity25 , que lastima ! follow @ @entity168 on @entity169 .			0

@entity43 started an @entity1 account for his great - grandmother , *battling* lung cancer
@entity47 has become an @entity100 sensation and has hundreds of thousands of followers
