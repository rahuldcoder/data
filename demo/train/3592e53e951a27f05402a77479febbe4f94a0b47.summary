@entity1 @entity0 was wearing black - out goggles			1
a guard dragged him onto a boat and someone forced him to drink seawater			0
" it was so nasty i threw up ... they stuffed the air between my clothes and me with ice cubes from my neck to my ankles ... every once in a while one of the guards smashed me , most of the time in the face			2
" in a new book @entity20 , @entity0 paints a horrifying picture of life at the hands of interrogators in the notorious @entity26 military prison in @entity27			1
the book depicts long days in isolation , sometimes chained to the floor in agonizing positions , held in extreme temperatures , often deprived of food and sleep			0
on multiple occasions he describes being beaten and humiliated by his questioners			2
he says he was left " shaking like a @entity40 's patient " and felt one of his interrogators " was literally executing me but in a slow way			2
" the 44 - year - old electrical engineer , originally from @entity43 , has been held in @entity44 since 2002			1
he was accused of being a member of @entity46 and of recruiting three of the hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks , as well as being involved in other terror plots in @entity51 and the @entity26			1
he 's never been charged and his lawyers say there is very little evidence against him			1
@entity0 admits to traveling to @entity55 to fight in the early 1990s , when the @entity26 was supporting the mujahedeen in their fight against the @entity58			1
he pledged allegiance to @entity46 in 1991 but claims he broke ties with the group shortly after			0
the @entity26 military continues to hold @entity0 as an enemy combatant under the @entity64 for the @entity65 of 2001 informed by the laws of war , according to @entity69 spokesman lt. col. @entity68			1
@entity20 is the first published account from a serving detainee which is being made available to the public			2
@entity0 hand - wrote the manuscript in his cell in 2005 and it took nearly seven years for @entity0 's lawyers to get it approved for release			1
he describes his first few years of detention in what he calls his " endless world tour " of interrogation from @entity43 , to @entity84 , to @entity55 and finally @entity27			2
in his early years at @entity44 , @entity0 was exposed to a number of special interrogation techniques that were personally signed off by then secretary of defense @entity87 , according to reports by the @entity90 and the @entity91			1
that included sensory and sleep deprivation , designed to grind him down , which wreaked havoc on his physical and mental health			2
" i could n't tell a thing about days going by or time passing ; my time consisted of a crazy darkness all the time , " @entity0 writes			1
" i was starved for long periods and then given food but not given time to eat ... " you have three minutes			0
eat ! " a guard would yell at me , and then after about half a minute he would grab the plate			0
" you 're done ! " "			0
@entity0 says the brutality reached a peak in late 2003			2
" i thought they were going to execute me , " @entity0 writes			2
" thanks to the beating i was n't able to stand , so [ redacted ] and the other guard dragged me out with my toes tracing the way and threw me in the truck , which immediately took off			0
the beating party would go on for the next three or four hours			0
" this period culminated in him being taken on a boat ride during which he was blindfolded and he says beaten for several hours			0
it was during this time that @entity0 says he began to make false confessions in order to stop the torture			1
at one point he says to his interrogator " just tell me the right answer			0
is it good to say yes or to say no ? " responding to @entity0 's allegations of torture , @entity68 , the @entity69 spokesman , pointed to a number of investigations into @entity44 detainee treatment			1
many of @entity0 's claims are corroborated by reports published by the @entity90 and the @entity91 in 2008			1
the boat incident which @entity0 describes in detail is mentioned in both reports , although neither provide complete details about what happened during this trip			1
@entity68 also said " @entity0 is eligible to appear before a @entity143 to assess whether his continued detention at @entity44 remains necessary			1
" even in its published form , portions of @entity0 's account are redacted			1
the @entity26 @entity69 says this was necessary to protect @entity26 personnel and national security			0
in some sections of the book , several pages at a time are completely blacked out			0
@entity0 's lawyers hope the book will build pressure on the government to finally let him go			1
in 2010 a district court judge ruled he was being held unlawfully and ordered his immediate release			0
but the government appealed that decision and the case has been in legal limbo ever since			0
" unfortunately for the government -- and fortunately for the rest of us -- these secrets are out now , " @entity0 's lawyer , @entity165 , told @entity2			1
" the @entity26 ca n't keep secret these things that it does any longer -- and it needs to close @entity44			2
it 's as simple as that			0
" when @entity26 president @entity175 took office in 2008 he promised to close @entity44 , but as he enters his seventh year in the @entity178 122 prisoners remain			2
at its peak there were more than 700			0
in tuesday 's @entity182 address @entity175 said his administration will work to finally " finish the job " and close it down			0
" as @entity26 , we have a profound commitment to justice - so it makes no sense to spend $ 3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit , " @entity175 said			0
" i will not relent in my determination to shut it down			0
it 's not who we are			0
it 's time to close @entity44			1

@entity0 's harrowing story is the first time a serving @entity44 inmate has been published
he describes beatings , sensory deprivation and starvation
he was originally detained in 2002 , accused of recruiting 9/11 hijackers
his lawyers say there is very little evidence against him
