@entity0 , @entity1 -- the ongoing unrest in @entity4 cast a long shadow saturday over the @entity6 , a gathering set up to address global security issues			1
while other items -- including terrorism and the new start treaty between the @entity13 and @entity14 -- were on the agenda , it was impossible for leaders at the conference to ignore the crisis			1
@entity13 secretary of state @entity19 signaled that the @entity13 is backing a transition led by newly appointed @entity4 vice president			1
" i think it 's important to follow the transition process announced by the @entity4 government , actually headed by vice president @entity25 , " she said			1
however , the envoy who delivered a message from @entity13 president @entity28 to @entity4 's leaders this week , @entity30 , told the conference via videolink that @entity33 must remain in office , despite protesters ' call for his resignation			1
@entity13 officials emphasized that @entity30 was speaking for himself , as an expert on the region , and not for the @entity28 administration			1
" president @entity33 remains utterly critical in the days ahead as we sort our way toward the future , " said @entity30 , a former @entity13 ambassador to @entity4			1
the @entity49 " is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends , " @entity45 said at the annual conference			1
a growing majority in the region are under the age of 30 , and many are unable to find work , she said			2
they are connected with each other and with events around them by technology			2
" and this generation is rightly demanding that their governments become more effective , more responsive and more open , " @entity45 said			1
meanwhile , resources such as water and oil are running out , she added			2
" leaders in the region may be able to hold back the tide for a little while , but not for long , " she said			2
" this is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of @entity75 , @entity76 and cities throughout the region			0
the status quo is simply not sustainable			0
" the conference , attended by leaders from @entity13 , @entity82 and @entity83 , found cooperation on various issues , including preventing violence during the recent referendum in @entity88 and curbing piracy off the coast of @entity91			1
@entity45 and @entity14 foreign minister @entity92 signed and exchanged instruments of ratification for the @entity96 treaty saturday , meaning it takes effect			1
@entity45 called it a " milestone " in the @entity13 - @entity14 partnership ; @entity92 said the @entity13 and @entity14 teams " worked as one team " to get the treaty negotiated and adopted			1
the agreement , formally known as the @entity96 , replaces start 1 , which expired in december 2009			0
the @entity106 approved the new start pact last december , while the @entity14 parliament ratified it in january			0
it is designed to slash the stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons in both countries to 1,550 warheads -- down from a current cap of 2,200 -- and 700 launchers			0
it also calls for a resumption of inspections of nuclear arsenals that ended when @entity121 1 expired and helps move forward @entity124 efforts to " reset " @entity13 - @entity14 relations			1
while leaders could not ignore the tumult in @entity4 , they stopped short saturday of endorsing protesters ' demands for @entity4 president @entity33 to step down			1
instead , they indicated @entity33 should be given time to implement changes			1
while it 's important to push for reform , " we should n't in the @entity136 say this leader should go or that leader should go , " said @entity135 prime minister @entity134			1
" there is no stability in @entity4 today , " @entity134 said			1
" we need change and reform and transition to get greater stability			0
... the more it is put off , the more it would create an @entity4 that we would n't welcome , the more that case will be strengthened			1
" @entity1 chancellor @entity150 also said stability should be restored before the next steps are taken			0
" early elections at the beginning of the democratization process is probably the wrong approach , " she said			2
right now , there is no leadership to transition to , she added			0
" we need to give people the chance to set up the right structures			0
" @entity30 , however , went further , noting that the @entity4 constitution is clear -- " if the presidency is vacated , then the speaker of parliament takes over and in a couple of months , you have elections			1
those elections would take place under the current dispositions			0
those dispositions are currently unacceptable to those protesting in the streets of @entity76 today			0
" changes are needed , he said , and " the president must say in office in order to steer those changes through			2
... it 's his opportunity to write his own legacy			2
" he said the present situation is " an ideal moment for ( @entity33 ) to show the way forward			1
" he said commentary from outside @entity4 should be restrained , as calls for @entity33 to go create a " negative force " inside @entity4			1
@entity30 was sent to @entity4 early this week to deliver a message from @entity28 to @entity33 and @entity25 , @entity190 spokesman @entity189 said			1
@entity45 also noted that " there are risks with the transition to democracy			1
" it can be chaotic			0
it can cause short - term instability , " she said , and in some cases , demonstrators have overthrown dictators only to have the election process hijacked			2
" @entity208 and uncertainty " arises in the absence of security , @entity205 @entity204 ban ki - moon said			0
" we see this across a diverse geography of troubled places , most recently in @entity214 , @entity4 and other countries of the @entity49			1
" we do not know how these events will end , " @entity204 said			0
" but this much we do know : they are driven , at bottom , by human insecurity : poverty , diminished or disappointed expectations ; the lack of good governance : corruption , ineffective public institutions , a deficit of democracy			0
" @entity134 spoke on @entity230 extremism and the threat it poses to security , noting that it differs from @entity234 -- and that " the ideology of extremism is the problem			0
@entity234 , emphatically , is not			0
" those who say the @entity136 should cut itself off from the @entity234 world should look to recent events in @entity214 and @entity4 , he said , for an example of how @entity244 values and @entity234 can be compatible			1
he seemed to suggest in his speech that @entity135 has been too tolerant of extremism , however			0
" when a white person holds objectionable views -- racism , for example -- we rightly condemn them , " @entity134 said			0
" but when equally unacceptable views or practices have come from someone who is n't white , we 've been too cautious , frankly even fearful , to stand up to them			0
... this hands - off tolerance has only served to reinforce the sense that not enough is shared			0
" all this leaves some young @entity261 feeling rootless , " he said			0
" and the search for something to belong to and believe in can lead them to this extremist ideology			0
" he said that instead of ignoring extremist ideology , " we -- as governments and societies -- have got to confront it , in all its forms			0
and second , instead of encouraging people to live apart , we need a clear sense of shared national identity , open to everyone			0
" also on the agenda is the struggle between @entity278 and @entity279			0
the @entity280 , composed of the @entity13 , the @entity281 , @entity14 and the @entity205 , met in @entity0 on the matter -- but noted in a statement the effect the @entity4 upheaval could have on the peace process			1
" the quartet members considered the implications of these events for @entity292 - @entity278 peace and agreed to discuss this further in upcoming meetings as a matter of high priority , " the statement said			1
the group said it " strongly urged " @entity278 and the @entity279 " to overcome current obstacles in the peace process			1
... in view of the developments in the @entity49 , the quartet expressed its belief that further delay in the resumption of negotiations is detrimental to prospects for regional peace and security			1
" and it said it " regrets the discontinuation of @entity278 's 10 - month moratorium on settlement activity " -- a hot - button issue for the @entity279			2
the quartet will meet again in march , said @entity315 , @entity281 foreign affairs chief			2
@entity278 prime minister @entity316 met with quartet representative @entity317 on friday , and afterward the two announced what @entity316 called " a series of steps " aimed at boosting economic prosperity and living standards for the @entity279			2
those steps include helping the @entity324 develop plants for electricity , water and sewage treatment , as well as diversifying gas supplies in the future			0
" i do n't delude myself for a second that an economic peace is a substitute for political peace , " @entity316 said			2
" he said he hoped the @entity279 would enter direct negotiations			0
@entity317 said he was pleased by the measures , and said they should result in a " radical overhaul of @entity324 's infrastructure			2
" however , he also noted , " none of this is a substitute for a credible political process			2
" but chief @entity279 negotiator @entity346 on friday scoffed at the measures , saying , " the only thing that will build @entity279 confidence is mr. @entity316 saying , ' i will stop building settlements			0
' " until @entity278 construction in the @entity352 and @entity353 stops , and the @entity316 government accepted a two - state solution , negotiations -- which broke down in september -- will not resume , he said			0
@entity2 's @entity357 , @entity358 and @entity359 contributed to this report .			2
