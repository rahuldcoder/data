@entity0 and @entity2 , who are the leading suspects in wednesday 's attack on the magazine @entity5 in @entity6 , grew up in a world of poor job prospects , life in the @entity11 equivalent of the projects and prison time that is not untypical for the @entity11 " underclass , " which is disproportionately @entity15			1
on friday , the two brothers were killed in a shootout with police , achieving their goal of a supposedly heroic " martyrdom			2
" before they died , one of the brothers spoke on the phone to a journalist from the @entity11 news network @entity25 saying , " we are just telling you that we are the defenders of @entity27			1
i was sent , me , @entity2 , by @entity29 in @entity30			2
i went there and @entity32 financed my trip ... before he was killed			0
" @entity34 was a @entity30 @entity35 cleric born in @entity36 who spent much of his life in his native @entity35 , but he left in 2002 when he became the subject of intense @entity41 scrutiny			0
he traveled first to the @entity42 and then to @entity30 , where he joined @entity29 , eventually rising to become the head of its operations to target the @entity46			0
@entity32 was killed by a @entity35 drone strike in @entity30 in september 2011			0
@entity2 , the younger of the brothers had dreams of being a successful rapper that fizzled and later worked in a series of menial jobs , including as a pizza delivery guy			2
he fell under the spell of a militant cleric in the 19th arrondissement , a gritty immigrant - dominated suburb of northeastern @entity6 that has little in common with the glamorous @entity11 capital city that is known to tourists			1
he was arrested by @entity11 authorities in 2005 when he was about to leave to fight in @entity63			1
he planned to travel to @entity63 via @entity64			0
this appears to be quite significant as the pipeline of @entity68 " foreign fighters " traveling to @entity64 and then to @entity63 during this time period was dominated by " @entity29 in @entity63 , " which was a precursor both of the @entity71 , which is @entity29 's affiliate in @entity64 , and also of @entity72 , which broke away from @entity29 early last year			0
he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008 for recruiting fighters to join in the @entity75 alongside the notorious leader of the @entity29 affiliate there , @entity78 , but did n't serve any time after the conviction ; the judge ruled that his pretrial detention had been enough			0
nonetheless , @entity2 's time in prison awaiting trial seems to have not only solidified his radicalization , but also connected him to people who were important in @entity11 militant circles while in pretrial detention , @entity2 met @entity89 , who was in prison for his role in an attempted attack against the @entity93 in @entity6 in 2001			1
@entity2 and @entity89 became friends and in 2010 , when @entity89 was released , he and @entity95 allegedly planned the jail break of another radical islamist who was serving a life sentence for his involvement in the bombing of the @entity103 train station in @entity6 in october 1995 that wounded 29 people			0
but prosecutors could n't prove the conspiracy , and @entity2 was released			0
@entity2 : ' i was ready to go and die in battle ' while there is no particular economic profile of terrorists -- some are from privileged backgrounds and others are not -- it 's interesting to note some of the similarities between the @entity2 brothers and the @entity119 brothers , who are alleged to have carried out the @entity121 bombings in 2013			2
the @entity119 brothers grew up in a working - class household in @entity123 , @entity124			2
the elder brother @entity125 had dreams of becoming a world - class boxer but was unemployed when he carried out the @entity129 attacks			0
he had traveled to @entity130 in @entity131 in 2011 in an attempt to meet up with militants there			0
he also felt alienated from @entity35 society , telling an interviewer , " i do n't have a single @entity35 friend			0
" the @entity138 were influenced by the jihadist propaganda of @entity32			0
the @entity140 , however , are not typical of @entity141			0
for @entity15 in the @entity35 the " @entity142 " has , on average , worked fairly well			0
they are as educated as most @entity35 and have similar incomes			0
this is often not the case for the @entity15 of @entity11 , who make up the largest @entity15 population of any country in the @entity46			1
consider that around 12 % of the @entity11 population is @entity15 , but as much as an astonishing 70 % of its prison population is @entity15			1
according to a researcher at @entity154 , @entity15 immigrants in @entity11 are two - and - a - half times less likely to be called for a job interview than a similar @entity157 candidate and @entity15 incomes are around 15 % below their @entity157 counterparts			1
many @entity15 , such as the @entity161 brothers , live in grim banlieue -- suburbs of large @entity11 cities — that are not dissimilar to projects in the @entity35 where there is little in the way of opportunity ; they live divorced from mainstream @entity11 society			1
according to the @entity171 , a police agency that monitors militants in @entity11 , half of the neighborhoods with a high @entity15 population are isolated from @entity11 social and political life			1
the @entity11 term for these neighborhoods is " sensitive urban zones , " where unemployment averages 45 %			1
in short for @entity11 muslims , there is no " @entity11 dream , " nor , of course , any " @entity185			1
" it 's also small wonder then that @entity11 has supplied more foreign fighters to the war in @entity64 -- around 700 -- than any other @entity68 nation , including , possibly , one of the @entity2 brothers			1
after a series of bombings in @entity11 in 1995 carried out by militants with links to the former @entity11 colony of @entity198 that included the @entity201 ' @entity200 attack , @entity11 authorities enacted harsh anti-terrorism laws that allow prosecutors to charge the mere intention to commit an act of terror as a crime and also to hold those suspected of such crimes for up to three years as prosecutors investigated their cases			1
since then , @entity11 has been effective at thwarting terrorist attacks -- largely due to these laws and a robust intelligence service -- and only a few terror attacks , such as those that occurred this week have been successful			2
the laws , however , did not inhibit people from traveling to countries in the @entity219 to join groups like @entity72 and @entity29			2
indeed , it did not stop @entity222 , the older of the two brothers involved in wednesday 's attack , from traveling to @entity30 to train with @entity29 in 2011			2
@entity5 attack : what we know and what we do n't because of the recent travel of hundreds of @entity11 fighters to the @entity219 , the @entity11 @entity229 adopted new anti-terrorism laws in november to prevent @entity11 nationals from traveling abroad to fight			1
a travel ban can be imposed on @entity11 nationals when " there are serious reasons to believe that someone is planning to travel abroad to take part in terrorist activities ... " the ban is effective for at least six months but can be renewed for up to two years			2
the law also allows for blocking websites that " glorify terrorism " in an attempt to counter radicalization online			0
with so many hundreds of @entity11 @entity249 fighters traveling to the @entity219 , hopefully , these kinds of measures will help to counter the kind of violence that took place in @entity6 over the course of this week .			1

@entity255 : as with some other @entity11 muslims , the brothers were *marginal* , economically and socially
he says they became active in @entity219 causes , had contact with other prisoners
