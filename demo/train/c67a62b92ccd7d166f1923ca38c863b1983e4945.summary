-- sometimes , the crash site is never found			2
in 1972 a @entity3 flight with one pilot and three passengers took off from @entity6 bound for @entity7 , planning to fly the route under visual flight rules despite bad weather conditions			0
after one last contact with air traffic controllers , the @entity11 was on its way			0
the plane never reached @entity7			2
the flight had two congressmen on board -- @entity19 of @entity20 and @entity21 of @entity22			0
the search for the missing aircraft was intense , encompassing 325,000 square miles of land and sea , with 3,600 flight hours used to look for the wreckage			2
but after 39 days , the search was called off			0
a @entity31 report acknowledged that the cause might never be known			0
in the case of @entity34 , a @entity35 missing since saturday , a search of an area captured by @entity39 satellite images that seemed to pinpoint the crash site turned up nothing			2
such images are rare , and typically , when a plane goes down in a remote area with no witnesses , one of the most crucial tools available to investigators is radar			1
" it 's very important , " said @entity49 , an associate professor at @entity50 who specializes in air traffic control			2
" there are basically two ways to find a plane -- radar and pilot communication			1
" radar can take two forms			2
one is primary radar , what 's sometimes called " skinpaint , " that simply reflects off an object			1
primary radar does n't give any information about the object it 's tracking			1
" if you work at an @entity70 ( @entity70 ) facility on an @entity72 flyway , you will pick up flocks of birds , " @entity49 said			2
primary radar can also pick up debris that might be raining down from an in - flight explosion , and in such cases a target that appears as one object suddenly appears as several objects			1
secondary radar , on the other hand , relies on plane 's transponder , a device located in the nose of the plane			1
the transponder broadcasts a signal to air traffic controllers that identifies the flight and its altitude			0
secondary radar is more than just a blip on a radar screen ; it tells the controllers the valuable information about the specific aircraft			2
@entity34 's transponder stopped broadcasting about 45 minutes into the flight			2
at that point , air traffic controllers in @entity103 had no more contact with the aircraft			0
at first , the search area focused on the plane 's intended flight path , as officials went on the assumption that the plane did not change course			1
" then they started exploring other possibilities , " @entity49 said			0
military radar tracked unidentified targets that could have been @entity34 heading west toward the @entity117 and possibly beyond			0
military radar can cover areas not covered by civilian air traffic control			0
but without the plane 's transponder working , that target tracked by radar is only " skinpaint , " or the reflection of a dense object			1
it ca n't identify the plane or give an altitude			1
and even the radar can only provide so much information			0
it 's possible for a plane to literally fly under the radar because coverage usually does n't go all the way down to the surface			1
in that case , a plane could continue undetected even in areas covered by radar			1
in addition to the 1972 @entity22 crash , other aircraft have gone missing without a trace			0
in 1962 , a @entity144 operating as a military transport disappeared over the @entity146 after taking off from @entity147			0
the recovery operation included 48 aircraft , but no sign of the plane was ever found			1
officials deny @entity154 jet kept flying for hours in the case of the @entity154 flight , the search area has continued to expand rather than contract -- something that experts say does not bode well for the likelihood of finding the plane			1
on wednesday , @entity163 authorities broadened the search area to 27,000 nautical square miles , nearly doubling its size			0
on thursday , authorities said they planned to look farther west toward the @entity168			0
it 's almost impossible to simply crisscross such a large area in low - flying planes and boats			1
" it 's a monumental task , " @entity49 said			0
" it 's a vast area			1
there 's a lot of terrain there , remote areas where the plane could have crashed			1
" after the @entity22 crash , @entity180 mandated that general aviation aircraft carry an @entity183 , or emergency locator transmitter			0
the @entity183 is designed to activate during a crash and broadcast a signal to an emergency frequency monitored by air traffic controllers			0
international civil aviation authorities require that international flights , such as the @entity103 - @entity192 flight , have @entity193 on board			1
it 's not clear , however , if the @entity154 plane had the device on board			1
if it did have an @entity183 , it has n't been detected -- and that could mean that the plane crashed in such a remote location that its signal is out of range , or that the device malfunctioned or did n't go off because the plane actually landed somewhere safely			1
" but then you get into how do you hide a 777 , " @entity49 said			0
" this is a serious aircraft			0
the @entity35 's tail alone stands 60 feet high			0
but right now , it 's a 200 - foot - long , 500,000 - pound needle in a haystack that could be as large as an ocean			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 says there have been *previous* flights that vanished and were never found
@entity218 : when a plane goes down in a remote area with no witnesses , radar is crucial tool
@entity218 : it 's nearly impossible to crisscross such a large area in low - flying planes and boats
she says radar wo n't work without transponders : did they malfunction ? did plane land ?
