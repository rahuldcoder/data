" they tortured me , " he said , describing how officers beat him and broke his ribs during his initial detention			0

" in january , in the winter , they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold , " @entity0 said			1
" they put me out without any shoes , any socks , and very few clothes			0
" experts say @entity9 authorities reserved especially harsh treatment of well - known intellectuals such as @entity0 because he was a former regime insider , who had risen to prominence after the @entity122			1
for a decade , he worked as a reporter for one of the main state news agencies			0
he also founded a free - speech advocacy group called the @entity127			0
" @entity0 is not an outsider to the regime			1
like others in the reformist movement that emerged from within the ranks of the government of the @entity138 , @entity0 angered many , including the @entity101 , " said @entity130 , an @entity9 - @entity131 academic and author of " @entity133 in @entity9			1
" @entity130 commended @entity0 for his " principled resistance to the government and the supreme leader			1
" " people like @entity0 are considered even more dangerous than those opposing the regime from outside , " he added			1

during that time , @entity1 attended high school in suburbs outside @entity164			1
four years after his arrest , the elder @entity0 said there was no formal reason given for his release			1
but he said the move was likely linked to the recent election of @entity160 to the post of president			0
several other dissidents detained during the 2009 crackdown were released last month , according to the @entity179 - language daily @entity178			2
the @entity9 government never issued a formal explanation for why these political prisoners were freed			0

it was the first direct contact between @entity131 and @entity9 presidents in more than 30 years			2
" not the system , but the situation has changed , " explained @entity0 , during his interview with @entity11			2
though optimistic about @entity160 's presidency , @entity0 warned that @entity9 was a " double state , " where true power lies in the hands of @entity205 and senior military commanders			1
he argued that expanded relations with @entity189 and the removal of crippling economic sanctions would help moderate figures such as @entity160 engaged in policy and power struggles with @entity9 hard - liners			0
removal of @entity131 embargoes would also help ordinary @entity9 who could no longer afford life - saving foreign phamaceuticals , he said			2
@entity0 's note of cautious optimism was echoed by his son			1
" there 's a lot of hope from what @entity160 did in the @entity131 and there 's a lot of good response from the people , " @entity1 said			1
" but then you have a lot of people who were in charge before the election and are still in charge and do n't like it			0
" son not sure when he can travel to @entity13 for now , @entity1 says it is not safe for him to return to @entity9 to visit his father			1
he has yet to fulfill his mandatory @entity9 military service , and he fears he could be detained due to his own outspoken criticism of the regime			0
" maybe in a few years i will be able to go back , but it 's a really big risk , " he said			2
meanwhile , his father predicted he is still at risk of being thrown back in prison			0
" i will support freedom in @entity9 , and maybe criticize the leadership in @entity9 , " he said			0
" so it is possible that they will come here and capture me again			0
" both father and son hope , however , that the authorities will lift an earlier travel ban that prevented the veteran journalist from leaving @entity9			2
if so , the two hope to reunite for the first time in more than a decade in a third country such as the @entity257 or @entity258			0
