" as doctors struggled to save this patient 's life , we could not readily tell the patient 's identification , " @entity42 , vice president for external affairs at @entity43 's , told a news conference monday			2
" we interviewed family members that evening and asked for any discernible information that could help us make that positive identification , " such as bone breaks , scars or other marks			0
