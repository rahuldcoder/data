last weekend , a 17 - year - old apparently committed suicide in @entity2			0
and because she was transgender , many assigned a political or social or religious narrative to her story before even fully recognizing her death			1
a disturbing trend when you consider the string of recent dramatic and , it must be said , senseless deaths that have crowded the nation 's headlines			1
looking through the agenda - driven prisms that helped define 2014 , they all appear disconnected			0
but when we pause , we can see they are anything but			0
consider what happened earlier this month , when @entity21 , president of @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , sent a campuswide email in support of students protesting grand jury decisions not to charge the police officers who killed @entity30 in @entity31 and @entity32 in @entity33			1
in it she said : " we are united in our insistence that all lives matter			0
" later , @entity21 was forced to apologize			0
you see , because she did n't specifically say " black lives matter , " she was accused of minimizing the pain and experience that was specific to the black community			0
i would argue " all lives matter " is every bit as revolutionary of a rallying cry and should hardly be said in shame			0
i thought about her apology after a man who was reportedly mentally ill drove from @entity51 to @entity52 and shot two police officers in the head while they were at work			0
and i 'm thinking about her apology now as my heart aches over the suicide of @entity59 , the teenager who took apparently took her life on sunday			0
" the only way i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n't treated the way i was , they 're treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights , " she wrote on @entity62 hours before stepping in front of a tractor - trailer on @entity65			1
she also wrote : " my death needs to mean something , " obviously feeling her life did not			1
if you fail to see the connection between @entity59 , the fallen police officers , @entity30 and @entity32 , then you are missing something important about what binds a society			1
laws and culture form sturdy beams , but the foundation of civilization is empathy			1
it is a slender but invaluable thread that allows us to communicate with those who speak a different language , explains why men double over at the sight of a male being struck in the groin , why our own eyes fill with tears at others ' sorrow and loss and why laughter is contagious			0
our innate ability to identify with the needs and experiences of others -- to have compassion , empathy -- is the very thing that makes us human			1
thus , the less empathy we have for others -- the less " all lives matter " to us -- the less civilized we become			1
the less civilized we become , the less human we are			0
of course , the notion that " all lives matter " does not speak directly to the implicit biases that have led to the criminal justice system 's mistreatment of people of color			1
it does not highlight the sacrifices law enforcers make or the dangers they face each day			1
" all lives matter " does not note the discrimination and ostracization of transgender people that apparently led to the torment felt by @entity59 -- discrimination and ostracization that even occurs within the larger lesbian , gay and bisexual community			1
but it does remind us that before we are black , white , @entity133 , liberal or gay , we are human			0
because in the end , the lapses in humanity that led to each of the high - profile deaths that have rocked our culture may be different in their particulars , but they are the same in the pain experienced by loved ones left behind			1
over my 20 - plus years as a journalist , i have covered numerous deaths			2
i can tell you about the agony in the eyes of the mother of @entity151 , the 21 - year - old gay man who was pistol - whipped , tied to a fence and eventually died back in 1998 ; it is similar to the pain in the eyes of @entity157 's mother			2
the cries i heard at the memorial service for @entity30 this past summer were as hard to hear as the cries i heard at a service for @entity162 , a 16 - year - old who collapsed and died on his high school 's basketball court three years ago			1
again , the circumstances surrounding each death are vastly different from one another			2
but when a parent buries a child , the hurt is hard to differentiate			0
there is a time to dissect mitigating circumstances , but it should not come before experiencing humanity and learning something from how we feel			2
it is a constant struggle to hold on to what connects us			0
especially when so many forces -- politics , media , religion -- flood in to demonize our differences , alienate one group of people from another , drown our compassion and leave our very humanity gasping for air			2
a 17 - year - old transgender girl took her own life during the holiday season			2
before we point fingers assigning blame , can we at least pause long enough to think about the meaning of a girl 's lost life ? to mourn ? to feel ? to be human ?			2

@entity201 : transgender teen killed self . many make it social , political story ; we should see humanity
he says in *reaction* to deaths of cops , @entity32 , @entity30 , empathy falls away , agendas take over
@entity201 : in these and teen 's death , we too often show lapse in crucial empathy that binds us
