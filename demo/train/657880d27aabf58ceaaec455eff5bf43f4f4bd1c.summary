-- @entity1 says he ca n't understand why he ca n't have custody of his son following his ex-wife 's death in @entity6			1
@entity1 is fighting for custody of his son after @entity9 died during another childbirth			1
@entity1 told @entity0 's @entity11 he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4 - year - old son at @entity15 in 2004 for a two - week vacation to @entity17 , @entity6 , that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle			1
shortly after @entity9 arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce , which she obtained in @entity6 , and would stay there with their son , @entity22			1
the running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the @entity28 and secretary of state @entity29			1
" a child belongs with his family , and there is no reason why @entity1 should not get his child back , " @entity30 said in a recent interview on @entity33 's today show			1
" and we 're hoping that that will be resolved very soon			0
obviously , if not , we will continue to raise it with the @entity6 government			2
" for nearly five years , @entity43 has fought to regain custody of his son			2
it 's a case that has been complicated by @entity43 remarrying , getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer			2
@entity1 is said to be living with his stepfather , who has been granted provisional guardianship			2
" i went down ... to bring my son home , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's @entity51 wednesday , figuring his ex-wife 's death had made the custody issue a moot point , and " we find out that this man does n't file custody , but he files to remove my name from a @entity6 birth certificate that they had issued for my son , who was born in @entity63 , @entity64			1
" @entity43 continues to press his case through the @entity8 government			2
" the @entity28 is working diligently to ensure that @entity1 and @entity1 are accorded their rights under the @entity72 of 1980 on the civil right aspect of @entity74 , " the agency said in a statement			1
" we 'll continue to insist that the @entity6 government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law			2
" the convention , to which @entity6 is a signatory , " is a multilateral treaty , which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return , " according to the @entity91 web site			2
@entity6 courts have refused to return @entity1 to the @entity8 for any custody hearings that @entity64 courts have ordered and the @entity6 government has not intervened			1
as a result , the case remains a stalemate			0
" i would tell him that he 's been very brave , as he has fought to have his son returned to him , " @entity30 said in the @entity33 interview			1
" his son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile , but mile after mile , back and forth , trying to make it clear that his son @entity22 deserves to be returned to him			0
" but on @entity51 , @entity106 , a @entity108 family spokesman , questioned @entity43 's fitness as a parent			1
" i do n't question the biological right , " he said			0
" the fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent , you have to be more than just a dna donor , mr. @entity11			0
fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures , it 's about sacrifice			0
it 's about providing support to your child			0
it 's about being there even when you 're not there			0
" and mr. @entity1 , while @entity9 was still alive , failed to do so , " @entity106 said			0
@entity1 visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the @entity8			1
" he asked me why i have n't come to see him in all this time , " @entity1 told @entity11 , " and that was very , very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question			0
i did n't want to tell him that ... they 're holding him			0
" international custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 @entity141 agreement , but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law			0
the next step in this case is uncertain .			0
