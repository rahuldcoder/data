-- @entity2 's reboot " @entity3 " earned $ 7.5 million from midnight shows during its @entity5 premiere last night â € ” $ 1.2 million of which came from 300 @entity8 screens			1
the $ 220 million web - slinging flick , which @entity2 expects will earn between $ 110 and $ 120 million over its first six days , has already taken in $ 50.2 million overseas , and it seems to be off to a healthy start domestically			1
" we had a fantastic start , " says a rep for the studio			0
comparisons are somewhat difficult given " @entity3 's " unconventional tuesday release â € ” " @entity17 " earned $ 7.5 million during its friday midnight debut on the way to a $ 151 million opening weekend , although that film was not presented in price - jacking @entity22 / @entity8 , and midnight screenings were less popular five years ago than they are today			1
another film from five years ago that opened on a tuesday , " transformers , " earned $ 8.8 million on monday night sneaks and took in $ 155.4 million through sunday night			2
based on these results ( and a whole lot of speculation ) , i 'd bet that " @entity3 " will take in about $ 125 million in its first six days , but honestly , it 's too soon to tell right now			0
