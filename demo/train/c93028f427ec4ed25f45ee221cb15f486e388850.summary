@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 saunters in the red soil , her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd			2
it is hard to believe the 6 - week - old , dwarfed by her human keeper , will grow up to be one of nature 's biggest beasts			2
until then , she lives at a @entity0 orphanage that takes in baby elephants struggling to survive			1
there , she walks around in the lush wilderness with her peers , drinks soy milk and waves her trunk playfully as her keeper applies sunscreen on her delicate skin			0
a red garment tied around her back keeps it safe from the sun 's glare			0
@entity3 is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought , poaching and shrinking habitats , which have decimated wildlife across @entity1			1
the baby elephant was found wandering , alone and confused , after her mother died of starvation , her caretaker said			0

the foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country , a popular tourist destination because of its animals			1
" you know if a human child came in need of care , you would n't put a bullet in or turn it away , " said @entity51 of the foundation			0
" elephants are the same			1
... whatever comes in , we have to make space			0
" the facility has more than 20 elephants in @entity0 and more at another center in @entity66 , where they are also rehabilitated			1
@entity1 depends on tourism as a main source of income			0
@entity3 taps into that to help earn the $ 900 monthly cost for her upkeep			0

long after they are gone , their caretakers will still worry about the fragile animals they help nurture			1
" after working with these elephants , it 's no longer just a job , " said @entity88 , the chief keeper			2
