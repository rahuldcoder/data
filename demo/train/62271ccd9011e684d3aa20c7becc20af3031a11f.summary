-- in the @entity3 press conference to open the @entity4 , @entity1 struck back at a conservative @entity6 group that suggested last week that the state should reconsider its funding of @entity9 because the festival 's liberal leanings did not reflect the state 's values			1
" sometimes the narrowest mind barks the loudest , and we 've over time come to ignore it , " said @entity1 , who also reminded @entity14 of the $ 80 million the festival attracts each year to the local economy			1
" we 're also offering a wide spectrum of choices			0
it 's up to the audience to choose ... so i would just say to these people -- we either ignore them or remind them that it 's a free country and maybe they should look at the @entity27			1
" but @entity1 , who took questions alongside @entity30 executive director @entity29 and @entity32 director @entity31 did acknowedge that the entire @entity34 industry might need to reexamine the way it treats and markets gun violence , especially in the aftermath of the @entity39 shooting			1
' @entity40 : meet @entity41 as a kid ! citing a pair of roadside movie billboards that featured prominent positioning of firearms , @entity1 , who once famously played the @entity51 , said , " my thought was [ as i drove by ] , does my industry think that guns will help sell tickets			1
it 's not a question that i could answer			2
but it seems like a question worth asking my own industry			0
maybe there 's a reason that -- maybe yes			2
i do n't know but it seems fair because i 've noticed how often guns are used in ads as though there 's something that translates in a positive way			2
" the trio also discussed the @entity30 's national and international outreach , seemingly doubling down on its " cultural exchange " in @entity69 but slamming the door on rumors that @entity9 had eyes on a @entity74 - based outpost			1
" there 's no truth to it , " said @entity1 , who expressed frustration with the initial media report			1
" i would be uncomfortable pushing our way into some place , " he said			0
" it 's better to be invited			2
" ' @entity83 ' : new @entity85 photo this year , the festival features 51 first - time filmmakers from 32 different countries , and there are as many female directors as male in the dramatic competition			0
@entity1 pointed to the festival 's ability to " flow with " and " accomodate " social , cultural , and technological change as one of its most enduring strengths			1
" [ @entity9 ] is not meant to be commercial ; it 's meant to be diverse , " he said			0
" the nice thing is that we 're still here [ after 30 years ] and diversity has proven to be commercial			0
