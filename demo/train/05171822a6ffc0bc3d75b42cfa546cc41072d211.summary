@entity0 -- @entity3 rep. @entity2 on wednesday became the first member of @entity5 to call for @entity7 director @entity6 to step down due to a prostitution scandal involving eleven agents that has raised questions about security at the agency			1
" there are only so many strikes you get -- in baseball it 's three , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
" i think ( @entity6 's ) had three			0
i think it 's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we 're getting a different culture in the @entity7			2
" @entity23 , a senior member of the @entity25 , cited an earlier security breach at a @entity28 state dinner involving the @entity29 , a couple who got through security without an invitation			1
he also noted the agency 's recent inability to remain within its budget			0
there needs to be " change at the top , " @entity2 stressed			1
but @entity25 chairman @entity38 , @entity39 , disagreed with @entity23 , telling reporters he did n't think the head of the agency should be held responsible			1
" i think that 's a reach ... to go after the head of an organization because a few guys mess up , " @entity38 said wednesday			0
@entity2 said the security issues were serious , and @entity5 needed to be more involved in finding out what happened in @entity49			1
" we are n't just talking about one prostitute			0
we are talking about a bus load of prostitutes that they 're bringing in , " @entity2 said			2
@entity55 agents are allegedly involved in the scandal , along with several members of the @entity59 military			1
the agents were in @entity49 in advance of a visit by president @entity63			1
the alleged prostitutes , the youngest of whom were in their early 20s , had all signed in at @entity68 's @entity67 , flashing their local ids			0
one of the women , a source said , became involved in a dispute with @entity7 personnel about how much she was to be paid			1
that dispute brought the incident to light			0
" this is kind of security planning 101 , " @entity2 said			2
" it is the basic core fundamental , and the big concern i have is that it is n't just @entity59 looking into this			0
it is the rest of the world , and so i think it is time we jump on this and do something about it			0
" the @entity90 @entity89 said he is confident the @entity91 is capable of handling its component of the investigation -- as many as ten members of the military have been implicated in the scandal			1
but @entity23 does n't have the same level of trust in agencies outside the military , and said he planned to urge the head of the @entity101 to hold hearings into the matter			1
the @entity104 , meanwhile , has announced it will hold a hearing on the matter next wednesday			0
homeland security secretary @entity107 has been invited to testify			0
the @entity7 is part of the @entity109			2
like @entity23 , @entity38 believes that the @entity91 is " very capable " of doing its own probe of members of the military who may be involved			1
he does n't see a role for @entity5 in the matter			2
" i do n't think @entity5 needs to jump in to start trying to fix something that we do n't even know what the problem is yet , " @entity38 said			0
but @entity38 said he would likely raise the issue with defense secretary @entity120 when he meets with @entity120 before the secretary 's scheduled appearance before the @entity25 on thursday .			0
