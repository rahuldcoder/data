-- @entity1 has plenty of reasons to feel on top of the world -- but one more victory at the @entity8 finals will mean he ends 2014 as the leading ranked player on the planet			1
the current @entity11 cruised past @entity12 in straight sets in his latest group match on wednesday to secure his second successive victory at @entity17 's @entity16 and take his astonishing indoor record to 29 matches without defeat			1
djokovic , who got married and became a father for the first time earlier this year , lost his serve in the opening game of the contest before roaring back to claim victory with the style and panache with which his admirers have become so accustomed			1
" it was a great match , no question , " @entity1 said in his post-match interview			1
" the opening three games were quite long but after that i managed to get back in the first set			0
i swung through my shots and he made a lot of unforced errors			0
he was n't close to his best and i succeeded very well with what i wanted to do			0
" not once has a singles tie at this year 's tournament made it to three sets and this never looked likely to become the first			1
this 6 - 3 6 - 0 triumph in just over an hour meant the crowd was treated to yet another one man show			0
and yet , @entity12 could scarcely have made a better start to the contest , breaking his opponent in the opening game and consolidating by serving to take the second			2
but from there on it was all @entity1 as the @entity59 star reeled off 17 of the next 18 points			2
in fact , @entity12 only managed to win another four points in the opening set and just the seven in the second			2
the seven - time grand slam winner is hoping to win his third consecutive title in @entity17 and it would take some showing to stop him			0
@entity1 has won 59 of his 68 matches this calendar year and is 17 - 5 against the world 's top 10 players			1
he can seal the end of year @entity11 spot when he faces @entity74 in his final group game on friday			1
@entity74 bounces back in the day 's other game , @entity74 cruised to a 6 - 3 6 - 1 victory over @entity79 champion @entity78			1
@entity74 , who was beaten in his opening match by @entity12 , required just 74 minutes to see off a disappointing @entity78			1
the @entity81 could yet qualify for the semifinals with victory over @entity1 in his final group game			1
" i think today was more about fighting and getting through it , " @entity74 said			2
" it 's not my first year			2
i have the experience of losing the first match in the past and i know how to come back			0
i think that was the biggest difference			0
" i just want to try to bring my best tennis and we 'll see what happens			0
i hope i can have a great match			0
" @entity78 has endured a difficult time at the finals having lost both of his matches in straight sets			1
the 26 - year - old , who has won just six games in his two matches , made 30 unforced errors during wednesday 's defeat			0
" it 's disappointing to play like this			0
i was not expecting it			0
but my body feels a little bit tired on the court , " @entity78 told reporters			2
" especially with these guys at this kind of level , even small mistakes , or if you 're not at your best , the outcome is not going to be going in your favor			0
" thursday 's action sees @entity120 take on @entity121 , while @entity122 will be hoping for a second victory at this year 's tournament when he faces @entity125 .			1
