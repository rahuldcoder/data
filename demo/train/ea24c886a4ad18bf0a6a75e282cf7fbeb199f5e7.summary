the case of @entity1 brought international attention once more to the innocent people getting caught in @entity5 's drug war			1
@entity6 , a @entity7 citizen and mother of seven children , was released late last week after spending more than a week in a prison in @entity11 , @entity5 , accused of trying to transport marijuana aboard a bus			1
she and her husband , @entity15 , were returning on the bus from a family funeral in @entity18 , @entity5 , when soldiers at a military checkpoint stopped them			2
the passengers were told to get out so that the soldiers and an official from the public prosecutor 's office could inspect it			0
she was arrested and handed over to the official because soldiers said marijuana was found under her seat -- conviction could have meant a minimum of 10 years in jail			0
a surveillance video showing her boarding the bus with only her purse , blankets and two bottles of water apparently exonerated her			0
opinion : shakedown ' justice ' in @entity5 unfortunately , not everyone is as lucky as @entity6			1
the @entity45 recently interviewed @entity46 , who described how one day in 1993 she decided to travel for the first time from her home state of @entity49 to @entity50 to buy some seeds for her plant nursery			0
according to her video testimony , she was afraid of traveling alone , and some people from her town persuaded her to travel with them			0
without her knowledge , she says they had her carry a bag with heroin through airport security			0
she was blamed for the drugs and taken to police custody , where she says she was tortured and raped and forced to sign a confession			1
in jail , she learned to read , and the first thing she read was her conviction for drug trafficking for smuggling heroin , which sentenced her to 22 years in prison			2
she was released after nearly 11 years			0
as the @entity5 government has stepped up its efforts to combat drug trafficking , the number of people who have been detained and accused of crimes related to drugs has dramatically increased			1
but they must struggle to defend themselves with often poor , or no , legal representation			0
a 2012 survey of the prison population by the @entity82 in @entity83 in eight of @entity5 's federal prisons found that the majority of the prisoners , 60 % , were in jail for drug crimes			1
of these prisoners , more than 43 % said that they did not have a lawyer present when they presented their testimony before the public prosecutor 's office , 44 % said their lawyer did not explain to them what was happening during the trial , and 51 % said their attorneys did not give them any advice			0
just as telling is the small number of cases that are ever brought to trial			0
the @entity45 and @entity102 did a study on drug laws in @entity105 , including @entity5			1
it found that during the first four years of the government of @entity5 president @entity107 -- whose term ran from 2006 to 2012 -- of the 226,667 detainees accused of a drug crime , 33,5000 , or less than 15 % , were ever sentenced			2
this finding suggests that in the majority of cases , the evidence presented against the accused was n't strong enough for charges to be filed , and of those , relatively few held up in court			0
@entity5 's justice system has a reputation for being rife with corruption -- with officials too often accused of negotiating with criminals or demanding or accepting bribes to set someone free			1
indeed , @entity6 said they demanded $ 5,000 to let his wife go			0
according to the @entity5 @entity129 's @entity128 of the @entity130 , 6 % of the @entity5 surveyed had confidence in the justice system			1
@entity133 said the main problems were that criminals are not held accountable , the system is corrupt , the judicial process slow , and the service from public servants is poor			2
in one high - profile case , 23 municipal police officers and two citizens from @entity142 , @entity143 , were arrested in march 2009 and held under arraigo , a controversial pre-accusation detention period , while evidence was supposedly being gathered against them for alleged links to organized crime			0
@entity5 's @entity150 documented that the agents were tortured during this detention period			2
thirteen of the detained were released after spending almost a year and a half in jail ; the rest were released after 3½ years , and the charges against them dropped			0
the @entity5 government has recognized the urgent need to change the country 's criminal justice system			1
in 2008 , important constitutional and legislative reforms were passed that could transform @entity5 's legal system to an adversarial judicial model with oral trials			2
this new system is very different from @entity5 's traditional inquisitorial model , where most of the evidence is presented in written form to the judge and the proceedings take place largely outside of the public view			1
if fully put into place , the reforms should make the justice system more effective , efficient and transparent			1
in his first few months in office , new @entity5 president @entity179 has affirmed his commitment to implement fully the justice reform at the state and federal level			2
it will be no small task			0
five years after the constitutional reform went into effect , only three of @entity5 's 32 states are working under the new system , and it is partially operational in only 10 others			2
in support , the @entity7 has provided more than $ 100 million to help @entity5 fully adopt the adversarial justice system and to address weaknesses in criminal justice institutions			1
last year , @entity5 human rights defender @entity195 stated that the country 's justice system had become a " factory for producing guilty people			1
" @entity5 -- and indeed anyone accused of committing a crime in @entity5 -- deserve better			0
a full transition to an adversarial system is essential to bring criminals to justice , strengthen the rule of law and provide due process guarantees for the accused			0
continued @entity7 support is essential as more states and the federal government work to build the criminal justice system that @entity5 desperately needs			1
as in @entity1 's case , too many people in @entity5 have been deemed guilty until proven innocent .			1

@entity216 : @entity7 woman jailed in @entity5 one of many caught in corrupt system
@entity216 : thousands arrested in drug wars on little evidence , and some tortured
woman *tricked* into carrying heroin was raped , forced to sign confession , she says
@entity216 : @entity5 , " a factory for producing guilty people , " needs new justice system
