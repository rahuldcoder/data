-- so much for a " clean " bill			0
the measure passed by @entity3 to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling also contains some goodies and gifts tucked into the 35 - page bill			1
there 's more money -- a lot more -- for a dam project on the @entity13 and millions of cash for @entity16 flooding repair projects			1
and the wealthy widow of a late @entity19 senator will receive a year 's pay as a death benefit			1
you have to hand it to a @entity3 that finds no bill is off limits for pork			1
it 's over for now " these people are like alcoholics			0
they ca n't resist taking a drink			0
it 's absolutely ridiculous , " said @entity32 sen. @entity32 of @entity33 to the @entity34 , referring to the dam project			2
" it shows that there are people in this body who are willing to use any occasion to get an outrageous pork - barrel project done at the cost of millions and millions of dollars			1
" here are five most surprising provisions to the bill : 1			0
@entity46 @entity48 kickback ? : $ 2.2 billion			0
that 's the amount in additional cash authorized for a project that involved a dam and decades - old locks on a river that flows through @entity57 minority leader @entity56 's home state of @entity48			1
sounds kinda fishy , but a @entity59 senate aid and a @entity61 senator say it 's on the level			2
the aide tells @entity0 that @entity65 did n't push for the project to be included			2
and sen. @entity66 , who 's a key figure on the committee that oversees what water projects get what money , says he and another senator asked for the cash			1
he tells @entity0 's @entity74 the new money -- which more than triples the original $ 775 million -- will save the federal government many millions because contracts wo n't be canceled due to work stoppages			1
still , the @entity79 calls the money a " @entity81			0
" what 's open for business again 2			0
flood recovery funds bridge to somewhere : this one 's a lot less controversial than the river project money			1
@entity3 ok 'd $ 450 million for rebuilding projects in flood - struck areas of @entity16			1
that 's well over the limit of $ 100 million for the @entity94 as allowed in the @entity95			1
wednesday 's authorization used similar language to a bill that died last month after the @entity99 declined to vote on it , according to sen. @entity101 of @entity16			1
he said @entity102 had been resilient , but they needed the money because " it 's time to let us get to work " rebuilding roads and bridges wiped out by overflowing rivers			2
nine things we missed during the shutdown 3			0
late senator 's widow for decades of service : @entity115 served in the @entity57 for almost 30 years			2
he died in june of viral pneumonia			0
this nation owed him a great deal			0
@entity3 has almost always approved a death benefit gift to the family equal to one year 's salary , which they provided for @entity115 's widow , @entity123 , in the bill			1
the thing is ... @entity115 was one of the richest members of @entity3 and was worth more than $ 59 million as of 2011 , according to @entity127			2
you can see why some people think it might not be a terrible thing to forgo $ 174,000 to the family			1
other winners @entity135 , we 're getting a big check : there were more agencies that got big money in the bill			2
agencies that fight wildfires could get as much as $ 636 million , depending on how bad it gets in the next year			0
the mine safety department is getting a bump in the fees it can keep , a $ 1 million increase to $ 2.49 million			2
a watchdog group meant to guard @entity19 ' right to privacy against overreach by government cyberintelligence will get $ 3.1 million , which they could use considering the year they 've had dealing with revelations about the super-secret @entity156 's programs			0
@entity127 , a political newspaper , reports that 's double the top amount the five - member panel has been given before			0
same pay for congress no raise this year : down on page 20 of the bill , it says there will be no cost of living adjustment for members of @entity3 for the next year			1
actually , it 's not that surprising			0
congressional pay has held steady for years			0
they last received a raise four years ago			0
and you thought you had it rough			0
wait , you do n't make $ 174,000 a year ? key points of the new debt deal			1

@entity95 includes billions for a project in the home state of one of the bill 's *negotiators*
@entity3 also put in money for flood - damaged areas , future wildfire fighting
a rich widow who was married to senator who died in office to get $ 174,000
@entity3 wo n't get cost of living bump to their checks
