president @entity0 gave @entity1 a box of seeds as a gift , a fitting token as their first - ever meeting provided a fresh start of sorts between the administration and @entity12 leadership after years of strained relations			1
" these , i think , are carrots , " @entity0 told the @entity14 , showing him a pouch from the box , which was made from timber from the first cathedral to open in the @entity19 , in @entity20			2
the @entity1 gave the president two medallions -- one symbolizing the need for peace and solidarity between the two hemispheres -- and a copy of " @entity29 , " or " the @entity30			1
" the book was penned by the @entity1 and calls for a new era of evangelization and a renewed focus on the poor			1
the tokens of goodwill underscored the goal of the meeting : focus on areas where two of the world 's most influential men agree , and gently tread ground where they differ			1
the two men greeted each other with a smile and a handshake and posed for pictures before sitting down across a table from each other			0
they spoke privately for nearly an hour			0
when they emerged from the meeting , the president and the @entity54 had slightly different takes on the tenor of their discussions , especially when it came to issues that have frayed the relationship between the @entity0 administration and @entity12 leaders			1
" ... ( @entity67 ) t was hoped that , in areas of conflict , there would be respect for humanitarian and international law and a negotiated solution between the parties involved , " the @entity54 said in a statement			2
" in the context of bilateral relations and cooperation between @entity79 , there was a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the church in that country , such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom , life and conscientious objection			0
... " @entity0 , in a news conference that followed , told reporters that such issues were " not a topic of conversation " with the @entity1 and instead were discussed with @entity54 secretary of state @entity93			1
according to the @entity54 , the two men also discussed the issue of immigration reform and " stated their common commitment to the eradication of human trafficking throughout the world			2
" on this point , the president and the @entity1 were simpatico			1
" i was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with him about the responsibilities that we all share to care for the least of these , the poor , the excluded , " @entity0 told reporters after the meeting			1
" and i was extremely moved by his insights about the importance of us all having a moral perspective on world problems and not simply thinking in terms of our own narrow self - interests			0
" the meeting took place two days after the @entity19 @entity120 heard arguments on a contraception mandate included in the president 's signature health care reform law			1
the law exempts churches and houses of worship from the requirement , but nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups are required either to provide contraception coverage to their employees directly or through a third - party insurer			0
the @entity135 has been vocal in its opposition to the provision , said sister @entity138 , a spokeswoman for the organization			0
" religious liberties and right - to - life issues are a concern , " she said of the tension between @entity19 @entity12 leadership and the administration			0
however , " the @entity19 bishops have appreciated the administration 's cooperation on issues of mutual concern			0
" 5 things you did n't know about popes and presidents those areas of " mutual concern " include immigration and poverty -- issues on which the president and the @entity1 could find common ground			1
in an interview with the @entity164 newspaper @entity163 , @entity0 pointed to the @entity1 's concern for income inequality , saying , " given his great moral authority , when the @entity1 speaks it carries enormous weight			1
" continuing to focus on income inequality , @entity0 said , " and it is n't just an economic issue , it 's a moral issue			2
i think the @entity1 was speaking to the danger that over time we grow accustomed to this kind of inequality and accept it as normal			2
" the president said he admires the @entity1 's courage to speak out on economic and social issues			1
" it does n't mean we agree on every issue , but his voice is one that i think the world needs to hear			0
he challenges us , " @entity0 told the newspaper			2
" he implores us to remember the people , especially the poor , who are affected by the economic decisions we make			0
" immigration issues @entity1 underscored his commitment to the plight of immigrants during a trip last year to the @entity164 island of @entity198 , a place where thousands of @entity201 migrants desperately fleeing political upheaval and poverty pour onto @entity205 shores			1
many die in the attempt to cross			0
next month , a group of @entity19 @entity12 leaders , including cardinal @entity210 , the archbishop of @entity211 , will follow suit and travel to the @entity19 - @entity214 border to highlight immigration concerns			0
on wednesday , the administration renewed its public call for immigration reform by backing an effort by @entity221 @entity220 to force a vote on the matter			0
" immigration reform is the right thing to do for our economy , our security , and our future , " the @entity221 said in a statement			0
@entity0 and @entity1 : unlikely comrades ? tensions between the administration and many leaders in the @entity234 began early in the president 's tenure over his support for abortion rights			1
a number of bishops criticized the @entity242 's decision in 2009 to award @entity0 an honorary law degree and invite him to give the commencement address			1
relations frayed further over the contraception coverage requirement in @entity248 , leading the @entity135 to pan the law			1
" it was a very tough year , " said @entity250 , a senior fellow with @entity251 who helped lead national @entity12 outreach for @entity0 's 2012 re-election campaign			2
" it was hard to find any reasonable @entity12 who thought the @entity258 mandate was handled well			0
" differences over same sex - marriage only added to the strained relationship			0
seeking unity , approval religious experts said @entity1 would not have been likely to wade into politically charged conversations during the meeting			1
" the @entity54 has to be very careful to not create a gap between what they 're saying and the bishops are saying , " said @entity267 , director of the @entity268 and catholic studies at the @entity270			0
" they will be very careful not to undercut the @entity19 bishops in that regard			0
" @entity1 accepts resignation of @entity279 ' @entity278 ' the meeting with @entity1 , whose approval ratings are in the high 80s , might also boost @entity0 in that regard			1
his standing with the public has hovered in the low 40s			0
after all , the @entity1 's name and quotes have been invoked in everything from discussions over unemployment insurance , the minimum wage and the bigger issue of income inequality			2
" if i was advising president @entity0 , i would say the no. 1 spokesperson on @entity19 immigration reform should be @entity1 , " @entity250 said			1
" he has so much capital in this city			0
you have @entity301 , @entity302 and atheists on the @entity304 quoting him			2
" house speaker @entity305 , an @entity307 @entity306 and a @entity12 , recently invited the @entity1 to address a joint session of @entity309			2
" everybody on the planet would like to have their picture taken with the @entity1 these days , " @entity267 said			2
" one of the things that would delight @entity0 is if some of that popularity would rub off			1
given the president 's current low numbers , he is hoping for a bit of a boost			0

the meeting is called a step toward *smoothing* tensions with @entity301
abortion and @entity248 mandates on contraception are areas of *disagreement*
one place for common ground : the plight of immigrants and the poor
pope @entity1 ' popularity could give president @entity0 a small bump in the polls
