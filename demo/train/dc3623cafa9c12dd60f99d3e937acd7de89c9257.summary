-- academic papers tend to be dull , but i just read one that disturbed me			0
" a veterinary and @entity7 of @entity8 in the ' @entity9 ' in @entity10 , @entity11 , " was published last year in the @entity5			1
and as we 'll see below , the " new " method of killing dolphins ( intended to be an improvement on the old method ) creates such terror and pain that it would be illegal to kill cows in this manner under @entity11 law itself			1
the paper is viewable free online , but it 's not for the faint - hearted			0
a little background : each year , people kill about 22,000 dolphins and porpoises in @entity11 's waters			1
in a town called @entity10 , every year they catch and kill several hundred bottlenose , striped , and @entity34 's dolphins , @entity36 's porpoises and pilot whales			1
( the @entity39 's @entity38 also stages an annual pilot whale drive - slaughter for food , which has the side effect of providing the residents with high doses of mercury			0
) @entity10 got famous in the nervy @entity47 - winning film , " @entity48			0
" the hunting season continues through march , activists have said			0
@entity51 , the new @entity52 ambassador to @entity11 , is among those critical of the hunt ; she tweeted : " deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing			1
" @entity11 officials have defended the hunt as legal and traditional			1
for some reason -- likely public relations -- officials in 2010 announced a " new killing method			1
" until recently , hunters speared and stabbed the dolphins to death after driving them onto the shoreline			1
the new method is supposed to reduce time - to - death			2
as such , it 's bogus			0
on paper , the new method involves destroying the spinal cord with repeated insertion of a metal rod			2
even on paper , the " new killing method " makes no attempt to damage the brain , which would at least end consciousness			2
in practice , the hunters splash around through the bloody water wielding their knives among the fully conscious , thrashing , squealing dolphins who have been trapped in the shallows and are being executed among their family and friends			2
meanwhile , the humans have a very hard time getting into the spine			0
several veterinarians and behavioral scientists who watched a covertly recorded video wrote , " this killing method			2
... would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world			0
" that includes @entity11 , oddly enough			1
@entity11 prime minister responds to dolphin controversy @entity11 's own slaughter guidelines for livestock require that the creature being killed must be made to lose consciousness and must be killed by methods " proven to minimize , as much as possible , any agony to the animal			1
" these guidelines define " agony " as pain , suffering , fear , anxiety or depression			2
but those livestock guidelines do not apply to whale and dolphin killing , which is governed by @entity11 's @entity117 , which treats dolphins and whales as nothing more than seafood with blowholes			1
the published @entity11 description promotes this " new " method by saying it , " results in a shorter harvest time , and is thought to improve worker safety			1
" ( @entity38 @entity130 use a similar killing procedure			0
) after the @entity11 drivers scare the dolphins into the shallows , they corral them and tie them together in bunches by their tails , hitch them to small boats , and drag them backward to where they 'll kill them			1
while being dragged , the dolphins have a hard time getting their heads above water to breathe , and some drown			2
the killer is supposed to destroy the dolphin 's spinal nerve by pushing a metal rod into the spine behind its head			2
but the nerve is encased in the spinal bones			0
veterinarians and behaviorists who viewed a video noted that the first shove did not penetrate the spinal bone			0
they describe , " the animal making vigorous movements during the insertion of the rod			0
" the man " redirects the rod and repeatedly pushes it into the animal			0
" at this time , " the rod makes first contact with the vertebral bones of the cervical ( neck ) vertebrae			0
the rod clearly requires very significant force to push further into the tissues at this time			0
" the hunter eventually withdraws the rod and inserts a wooden peg into the wound to prevent bleeding			0
this is part of the new method			2
why prevent bleeding of a creature you are trying to kill ? because -- i 'll quote the @entity11 description so you do n't think i 'm making this up -- this " prevents pollution of the sea with blood			1
" slaughterhouse - killing rules for livestock such as cattle require " rapid bleed out			0
" but when killing a dolphin , the workers create a massive spinal wound , then plug it to prevent the bleeding that would at least speed loss of consciousness to the dolphin , whose sensing brain remains undamaged			2
from this point , just to make a long and appallingly hideous story a little shorter for the sake of our comfort , the dolphin in the video who is benefiting from the new and improved killing method spends the next three and a half minutes thrashing , nodding its head rapidly , and opening and closing its mouth			1
the men around it ignore it ; they 're busy doing the same thing to other dolphins			2
the entire process lasts many hours , sometimes days			0
with some understatement , the veterinarians and behavior experts describing the video write , " the treatment of dolphins in the drive hunts sharply contradict current animal welfare standards employed in most modern and technologically advanced societies ... the systematic mistreatment of dolphins and whales , allowed and sanctioned by a highly developed country such as @entity11 , is in striking contrast to @entity237 , @entity52 , and even existing @entity11 [ livestock ] legislation			1
" they note that in 2006 @entity11 instituted an unofficial ban on invasive chimpanzee research			1
they conclude by saying that there is , " no logical reason to accept a killing method that is clearly not carried out in accordance with fundamental and globally adopted principles on the commercial utilization , care , and treatment of animals			1
" @entity8 killers have their reasons			0
they say it is " pest control , " claiming -- as if in self - defense -- that dolphins eat too many fish ; and they do it for meat to sell , and to sell live young dolphins to marine parks and swim - with - the - dolphin programs in @entity11 and other countries			1
in a word , the usual reason : money			0
most people in @entity11 do n't benefit , and no one would go hungry without dolphin and whale meat ; in fact most people do n't eat any			1
but , officially , @entity11 reacts strongly to such assaults on its tradition and culture			1
assaults , bear in mind , that come mainly in the form of trying to simply film or describe what is really happening , then politely asking them to stop it			0
for such a thoroughly self - westernized country as @entity11 , with its baseball , jazz , tobacco , subways , global business and automakers , to object to criticism of its " culture " is odd			1
to publicly stake a seemingly large proportion of their nation 's cultural identity on slaughtering dolphins and whales while westernizing in almost every way seems , to me , strange			0
and , mainly , cruel			0
let it end , for good			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity309 .			1

@entity309 : a " new " method is being used to kill dolphins in controversial hunt in @entity11
he says the method *prolongs* the pain of the highly social animals
@entity52 ambassador to @entity11 @entity51 tweeted her criticism of the dolphin hunt
@entity309 : methods used on dolphins would not be allowed in slaughterhouses in @entity11 , elsewhere
