-- if there 's one thing that kills bedroom coziness , home decorators say , it 's a bed - in - a - bag set			1
it might seem like a smart idea to buy everything together , but ultra-coordinated , flat bedding and stiff comforters often found in bagged bedding are the enemy of an inviting bedroom , said @entity14 , @entity15 blogger and former home accent and interior designer			1
" fluff is key , like clouds or cotton , " @entity14 said			0
for her , and many decorators who contributed to this week 's " inviting bedrooms " @entity24 assignment , the feel of bedding is important			1
whether it 's crisp , white sheets from a store like @entity30 or expensive , vintage - looking throws from @entity31 , decorators say it 's important to feel like you 're sleeping on a cloud			1
and to get that feel , you must control the fluff			0
a carefully curated collection of down duvets , mattress pads , quilts and blankets of different thicknesses allow for temperature control and comfort , whether you 're fast asleep or sniffling through a miserable flu bug -- and that probably wo n't come from a preselected , oversized bag , decorators said			1
but is it just decorator snobbery ? when pressed , decor blogger @entity57 said , " a bed in a bag can sometimes be a good jumping - off point , if you add some other elements like patterned sheets or different shams			1
" likewise , @entity14 relented : " well , it 's ok , really			1
if you are unsure of what pillows and bedding accessories you like , then buying a bag might be best			1
" but she also pointed out that the pillows in said bag are " not always the softest material , " and that matters a lot			2
pillows pillows are key , decorators said , and they must be chosen carefully			2
" pillows have always been a big discussion in our house , " said interior designer and the @entity74 blogger @entity73			2
" after a lot of trial and error , i 've found that we need at least one king - size synthetic pillow and one regular - size down pillow per person			2
" the combination , she said , is perfection			0
" i think every bed needs several good pillows besides the decorative kind , " said @entity89			2
the calming , white master bedroom she decorated is " the most comfortable place for me in our home , " she said			2
@entity98 , part of the @entity101 decorator team from @entity102 , @entity103 , also finds pillows paramount			0
" my husband and i love our @entity107 pillows that mold to the shape of our neck and head , " she said			0
" our young boys love them , too , and steal them often			0
" furniture but scratchy sheets aside , comforters that match throw pillows that match curtains , elicit a shudder and " ugh " from interior designers like @entity122			2
and what of a matched suite of bedroom furniture ? they inspired the same kind of disdain			1
" do n't do it ! " @entity122 pleaded , urging a more eclectic approach			0
the " paint by numbers " mountain vacation bedroom @entity122 designed embodies her decorating aesthetic			2
" some vintage pieces , some new , different wood tones , some painted , " is how she put together a cozy , inviting bedroom for clients			1
interior decorator and blogger @entity140 said matching bedroom furniture makes her feel " claustrophobic			1
" " matching bedroom sets are definitely a buzzkill for me , " @entity145 on the update blogger @entity143 said			1
" i feel like a bedroom can be uncomfortable if it 's too formal			1
" @entity149 and according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes , designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture			1
" a headboard gives the bed a presence in the room , " @entity89 said			1
" whether it 's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed , a headboard makes the room feel more finished			1
" " important " does n't always mean " expensive			0
" many headboards featured in this week 's gallery are @entity15 projects			2
" this spot is so special to my husband and me because we built and upholstered the bed ourselves , " @entity169 said			2
" every night when we crawl in to sleep , we 're reminded of this project we took on , not knowing if we could even do it			0
" @entity180 head - honcho and home decor blogger @entity177 is similarly proud of the impact her @entity15 headboard has on her master bedroom			1
" we have an @entity185 bed , something that was in our price range when we first bought it , but it never really stood out on its own , " she said			2
" after making a custom headboard , it 's like we have a brand new bed ! it gave our bedroom so much character and the fact that it 's handmade -- it was my husband 's first attempt at a project of that scale -- makes it so much more meaningful			1
" the large headboard @entity14 created for her master bedroom reflects her personal style			2
" right now i am loving gray and silver			0
the corrugated steel roofing i used for this one is shiny and massive , " she said			0
" it 's not very feminine but it creates a soft , romantic reflection from the side lamps			0
" lighting @entity89 also finds that lamps are an indispensable ingredient to an inviting bedroom			0
" i recently moved the lamps in our bedroom to another room in the house , and we were with only an overhead light for a couple of months , " she said			1
" it just felt so cold to me			0
" soft light makes a bedroom cozier , she said			0
so , too , can black - out drapes , or even eye masks and white noise machines			0
light - limiting drapes can come in handy for the occasional sick day , @entity140 said			0
" there 's nothing worse than being laid up in bed with a cold and it 's sunny and wonderful just outside the window			1
i can pull my drapes shut and block out the sun and pretend i 'm not missing out on a glorious day , " she said			0
tvs the only thing it seems decorators ca n't agree on when it comes to bedrooms is whether to put a tv in the room			1
for some , like @entity122 , it 's a must			0
" i know for so many a tv in the bedroom is a big no - no , but i have to have a tv in the bedroom			1
i love to lay in bed and watch tv until i fall asleep			0
it 's really the only thing i need ; no scented sprays or the sounds of crashing waves , just the sounds of the ' @entity255 , ' " she said			0
even if they think tvs do n't belong in bedrooms , decorators confess to it apologetically			0
" i know i 'm in the minority , " @entity73 said , " but no tv			0
" " i 'll be hated for this one , " said @entity98 , who says tvs destroy the cozy vibe of a bedroom			1
" are we not bombarded by screens ? if you can swing it , no home office or tv in your bedroom			0
" are you obsessed with decorating your house ? show us your skills at @entity0 's @entity24 and your photo could be featured in next week 's story			1
our next focus : well - dressed mantels .			0

decorators : bed - in - a - bag sets can be stiff and too coordinated for a cozy room .
