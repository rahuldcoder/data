@entity0 -- president @entity2 and @entity4 challenger @entity3 are neck - and - neck in national polls , while @entity2 has an edge in crucial battleground states that will decide tuesday 's election			1
the dynamic sets up a possible outcome that has happened rarely in @entity13 politics and could undermine the credibility of the victor -- @entity3 beats @entity2 in the overall vote , but the president gets reelected by winning the decisive @entity18			1
it would be the fifth time in history that the candidate who got the most overall support did n't win the election , and the first time that an incumbent president prevailed without capturing the popular vote			1
explainer : what happens in a electoral tie ? analysts acknowledge that such an outcome could happen , especially when the race is so tight , but they called it unlikely			0
state results generally follow the national trend , they say , so the chances were remote that @entity3 's victory margin in states he wins will be so much larger than @entity2 's in states the president wins that it would counter the @entity18 result			2
" if the state polls are right , then mr. @entity2 is not just the favorite in the @entity18 but probably also in the popular vote , " @entity45 wrote last week in the @entity48 ' @entity47 blog that analyzes polling data and trends			1
@entity54 , the senior elections analyst at @entity55 , wrote last month that the chances of a popular / electoral vote split were about one in three if the candidates are within one percentage point of each other in the overall count			2
under the @entity18 system , each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population			2
the winner of the popular vote in each state gets its electoral count , with 270 of the 538 available needed for victory			1
politics : voting challenges in battleground states could create drama , headaches the last split between the popular and electoral vote was 2000 , when @entity80 vice president @entity79 outpolled @entity82 gov. @entity81 by more than 543,000 votes in the raw count but narrowly lost the electoral tally			1
in an outcome decided by a controversial @entity89 ruling that gave @entity90 to @entity81 by 537 votes , the @entity4 challenger ended up with 271 electoral votes to @entity79 's 266 , while @entity79 got 48.4 % of the popular vote to 47.9 % for @entity81			1
prior to that , all previous occurrences were in the 19th century , when the population was smaller and spread among fewer states			0
in 1888 , @entity4 @entity98 defeated incumbent @entity80 president @entity99 by 233 - 168 in the @entity18 even though @entity100 won 48.6 % of the popular vote to 47.8 % for @entity98			1
twelve years earlier , @entity4 @entity102 defeated democrat @entity103 by one electoral vote , 185 - 184 , while @entity103 won 50.9 % of the popular vote to 47.9 % for @entity102			1
the result was so contentious that it took a special electoral panel to decide that @entity102 was the winner			0
politics : why tuesday , why november , why elephants ? election riddles solved in 1824 , @entity113 lost both the popular and electoral vote to @entity115 , who failed to get the minimum @entity18 support for victory			2
the @entity118 decided the winner and chose @entity113 , the son of @entity13 's second president			0
any close election causes raw emotions and the uncertainty from popular / electoral vote splits can undermine the legitimacy of the winner , noted @entity127 , a political science professor at @entity128			2
that would be especially true this time if @entity2 , the incumbent , claims victory without getting more overall votes , she said			0
" when you look at an incumbent president that ca n't win the popular vote , you look at a guy that 's very hobbled from the start , " @entity127 said			1
" for governing , it creates a much bigger problem than it does for the legitimacy of the election			0
" at the same time , she added , it would be hypocritical of republicans to cry foul when they benefited from the same situation just 12 years ago , saying : " if you win that way , you have to be prepared to lose that way			0
" another factor that could contribute to a popular / electoral vote split is devastation from @entity153 in states like @entity155 and @entity156 , which were expected to provide strong support for @entity2			1
while the president will still win both , his overall vote total could be lower if turnout is reduced in the aftermath of widespread power outages and structural damage from the storm			0
opinion : @entity2 's victory wo n't transform @entity13 @entity127 , however , said the election results would clearly demonstrate such a scenario , providing an explanation for what happened that would soften challenges to the legitimacy of an @entity2 victory via the @entity18			0
" i do n't see any legitimate claim by either side that the system is n't going to function well , even if you get this distortion , " she said			0
@entity18 voters , called electors , will meet on december 17 in their respective states and vote for president and vice president on separate ballots			0
in the case of a tie between @entity3 and @entity2 , the @entity118 would meet in january to decide the president , with each state getting one vote			1
the @entity192 decides the vice president			0
with the likelihood of a @entity4 - controlled @entity118 and a @entity80 - led @entity192 , an @entity18 tie between @entity2 and @entity3 would make possible a split administration , with @entity3 as president and incumbent @entity197 as vice president			2

@entity3 and @entity2 neck - and - neck in polls
winning the popular vote does n't *guarantee* the @entity209
candidates must win 270 electoral votes to prevail
the winner of the most votes has lost four times before
