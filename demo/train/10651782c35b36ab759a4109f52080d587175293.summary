@entity0 , @entity1 -- a bore hole reached 33 trapped @entity1 miners friday , officials said , but it must be widened before the miners can squeeze through -- a process that should take a few weeks			1
the " @entity9 " drill was welcomed by the jubilant workers as it reached its target in the mine 's workshop , 623 meters ( about 2,040 feet ) down , at about 10:30 a.m. et friday , officials said			1
" once we got back to drilling it went very good , the rock was real tough the last few hours , but we did it , " said @entity14 of @entity15 miners assisted the operation by offering guidance for the drilling			1
the workers could be rescued , if all goes well , in late october or early november			0
officials already are planning how they will bring the miners to the surface once a bore hole is wide enough for the task			1
the daunting rescue may require an oxygen - fed cage that will haul them up one at a time			0
the trip , which was first thought to require two hours , may be doable in 15 minutes , officials said			0
friday 's development was bright news indeed for the miners , who will enjoy a feast and celebrate @entity1 independence day saturday			1
@entity9 is one of three options for reaching the group			1
drilling under @entity43 will stop this weekend once the drill bit reaches 380 meters ( about 1,250 feet )			1
the drill will receive scheduled maintenance before resuming early next week , engineer @entity45 said			1
engineers estimated that this plan would take between three and four months to complete the hole			0
the assembly of the drill to be used in @entity53 has been completed , an official said , adding that he hopes it will begin drilling this weekend			1
meanwhile , a senator representing the region said better government regulation could have prevented the situation			2
" this accident could have been avoided and we could have avoided seeing the anguish of 33 families waiting for their loved ones to come home , " said sen. @entity60 , who represents the @entity57 where the @entity62 mine is located			0
" this could have been avoided if we had businessmen with a sense of social responsibility			0
you can not carry out a mining operation at the cost of miners ' lives			1
" @entity60 -- the daughter of former @entity1 president @entity78 -- said government regulators , who temporarily closed the mine in 2008 , should have been more vigilant			1
" @entity82 organizations did not fulfill their role			0
instead of shutting down this mine for seven months , they should have closed it for good , " she said			0
two lawsuits filed last month alleged that the @entity89 , which owns the mine , violated laws in failing to provide sufficient security			1
the mine reopened in 2008 after a yearlong closure without the proper safety measures being put in place , including measures to shore up the rock face , according to attorney @entity99 , who is representing one of the miner 's families			2
" it has been proven , the mine did not have a second escape route and there was no ladder in the ventilation chimney , " @entity60 said thursday			0
at the time when the suits were filed , there was no response from the mining company			1
but shortly after the mine 's august 5 collapse , company manager @entity114 said there was no way to know it would happen			2
" this was impossible to predict , " he said , according to @entity119			0
asked whether new laws are needed to enforce mining codes , @entity1 mining minister @entity121 told @entity2 that mining laws are not to blame for the men 's predicament			1
" the problem was that the owners did not do what they were told to , " he said			0
" not because it was too expensive or they were greedy , but just because they did n't care			0
... we have got good regulations but maybe we need to improve auditing of those regulations			0
" representatives of the @entity89 have said previously they will collaborate fully with @entity1 authorities and the @entity139 in their inquiries about what went wrong at the mine			1
the miners ' plight quickly caught the attention of officials and politicians			2
when the 33 first sent word that they were alive , president @entity148 triumphantly waved their written note before the media			0
even though her @entity153 opposes @entity148 's government , @entity60 praised his handling of the situation thursday			2
" this accident has increased the popularity of president @entity148			0
it is something he has earned because he took decisive action to save the miners , and that has meant he has risen in the opinion polls , " she said			2
@entity60 's father , who died in gen. @entity167 's 1973 military coup , completed the process of nationalizing the @entity1 copper industry in 1971			1
average @entity1 copper prices this year are near historic highs			1
but even so , @entity60 said her father would have viewed the current situation with " great sadness			0
" " he would see that even when the price of copper is high , that does not translate into better salaries , better working conditions or better safety , " she said			2
" businessmen have no greater social conscience and are no less voracious than before			0
" earlier thursday , @entity121 expressed optimism that the 33 miners will be rescued in early november and maybe sooner			2
" everything is going a little bit better than anticipated , " @entity121 told @entity2 about the @entity43 , @entity9 and @entity186 holes being dug in an effort to open a passageway to safety for the men			1
two bore holes -- each about 8 centimeters in diameter -- are currently being used to supply the miners			2
the first carries compressed air , water , communications and a constant supply of electricity to power lights that are used to simulate daytime and nighttime			0
supplies -- such as food , clothing and letters -- are sent down to the miners via metal cylinders known as " carrier pigeons " through the second bore hole			2
@entity2 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this story .			0
