@entity0 , @entity1 -- did a @entity4 fire the missile that downed @entity6 17 ? that depends on who you ask			1
a top @entity1 official says he has no doubt			1
@entity12 , @entity1 's director of informational security , told @entity2 the person who shot down the flight was " absolutely " a @entity4			1
" a @entity4 - trained , well - equipped , well - educated officer ... pushed that button deliberately , " he said			2
" we taped conversations " between a @entity4 officer and his office in @entity22 , @entity17 said			2
" we know for sure that several minutes before the missile was launched , there was a report " to a @entity4 officer that the plane was coming , he said			2
" they knew the plane was coming with constant speed , in constant direction , " and should have known it was not a fighter jet but " a big civilian plane , " he said			0
@entity36 officials say @entity39 rebels were responsible for shooting down @entity6 17 , but they now believe it 's likely the rebels did n't know the plane was a commercial airliner when they opened fire , @entity36 intelligence officials said tuesday			1
the officials have determined that @entity4 bears some responsibility for the incident because of its support for the rebels , but they have n't been able to determine exactly who fired the missile , whether @entity4 military were at the site or whether the @entity4 were directly responsible for launching the missile			1
@entity22 has denied claims that it pulled the trigger			0
and @entity56 lt. gen. @entity55 suggested a @entity1 jet fighter may have shot the plane down			2
@entity1 president @entity59 rejected that in an exclusive interview with @entity2 , saying that all @entity1 aircraft were on the ground at the time			2
@entity64 , @entity4 's ambassador to the @entity65 , was asked monday about different intercepted recordings , purportedly of @entity39 rebels talking about shooting down a plane			1
@entity64 suggested that if they did , it was an accident			0
" according to them , the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet , " he said			0
" if they think they shot down a military jet , it was confusion			0
if it was confusion , it was not an act of terrorism			0
" pro-russian rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack			0
at crash site , an eerie calm now that rebels have handed over the black boxes and the bodies of victims killed when @entity93 went down , the crash site in eastern @entity1 was eerily quiet on tuesday , a spokesman for observers in the area said			1
there were no more local emergency workers or teams combing the wreckage -- even though @entity99 officials said they were n't sure whether the remains of all the victims had been recovered			2
" they had even taken down the tents , " said @entity102 , spokesman for the monitoring mission from the @entity104			0
" there was no activity whatsoever			0
... we had an internal discussion today on whether to say it 's already trending towards a cleanup operation			0
there 's no active recovery of remains going on right now			0
" as investigators arrive at the scene , it 's unclear what evidence they 'll find			1
before activity died down at the site , @entity102 said , observers saw emergency workers moving around wreckage			0
" @entity125 pieces of the fuselage have been moved , " he said			0
at one point , he said , observers witnessed teams at the scene " taking out diesel - powered saws and sawing quite invasively into the cockpit			0
" @entity99 pm : identifying bodies could take months a train carrying the remains of crash victims arrived in @entity137 , @entity1 , on tuesday			1
investigators were going through the train cars and transferring bodies to a factory , where a facility was set up to transfer them to coffins and get them on a military plane to the @entity99 for forensic investigation			1
but officials offered conflicting reports about how many bodies were on the train , with a top @entity99 official expressing concern that the remains of more victims could still be at the crash site			1
@entity158 official @entity157 , who traveled on the train with the remains , said there were 282 corpses and 87 body parts aboard -- the same tally @entity1 officials earlier gave to describe the remains recovered from the crash site			1
but @entity99 investigators only confirmed there were at least 200 bodies transported from the crash site , @entity171 , head of the @entity99 delegation , told reporters			1
another @entity99 official said investigators were still going through the train cars and it was possible all the crash victims were on the train			1
there were 298 people aboard the plane when it crashed			0
@entity99 prime minister @entity184 said he expects the first plane carrying the remains to arrive wednesday in @entity187			1
as soon as the remains are identified , families of the victims will be informed			0
in some cases , that could happen quickly , @entity184 said , but in other cases , identification could take weeks or even months			0
@entity195 , the @entity99 foreign minister , said bringing the victims ' remains home is his country 's top priority			1
" to my dying day , i will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs , " he told the @entity200 on monday , " and that human remains should be used in a political game			0
" what 's next in the investigation ? @entity1 rebels handed over the so - called black boxes tuesday after what @entity158 officials said were repeated attempts to negotiate with the rebels			1
" in recent days , we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the @entity221 crash site , " @entity158 prime minister @entity215 said monday			1
but the handover is only the beginning			0
@entity225 prime minister @entity224 tweeted that @entity225 agreed to a @entity99 request for accident investigators at @entity228 , southwest of @entity229 , to retrieve data from the boxes for international analysis			1
and the @entity233 said one of its experts will help retrieve information from the black boxes			0
the voice recorder could include audio from the cockpit , which would show whether the pilots knew the plane had been hit , said @entity243 , a @entity2 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity36 @entity245			2
and the flight data recorders will give investigators information about engine settings , pressurization and electronic communications , among other details , she said			0
but even the black boxes might not answer the two most pressing questions : who shot down the plane and why			0
@entity36 and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface - to - air missile in rebel - held territory			2
evidence supporting that conclusion includes telephone intercepts and video of a @entity265 missile launcher traveling into @entity4 with at least one missile missing			2
@entity36 president @entity267 , @entity224 and others have said the @entity39 rebels could not have shot down such a high - flying jet without weapons and training from @entity4			1
@entity267 called on @entity4 to rein in the rebel fighters , who he said had treated remains poorly and removed evidence from the site			2
" what exactly are they trying to hide ? " he said			0
@entity4 president @entity280 said tuesday that his country would use its influence with @entity1 rebels to push for a full investigation , the @entity279 news agency reported			1
but those assurances did little to stem efforts to crack down on the rebels and their supporters			0
the @entity290 's @entity289 agreed tuesday to establish a new list of entitles and individuals , including some from @entity4 , to face @entity290 sanctions			1
@entity195 said the @entity99 would seek sanctions involving various fields , including defense , high technology , the energy sector and financial services			1
a brawl broke out tuesday in @entity1 's parliament , where fighting takes place frequently , as lawmakers voted to increase the number of troops battling @entity39 rebels			2
@entity309 , who is from the @entity311 region and has been noticed at separatist rallies , accused the government of killing its own people			0
a nationalist lawmaker then ran up to him			0
soon many lawmakers swarmed around them , with some apparently trying to break up the fight			0
@entity1 opens criminal case the @entity36 government has released a map of what it says was the flight 's path and the site from which the missile was fired			1
it also released images that it said showed a weapons buildup at a @entity4 training facility near the @entity1 border			1
as @entity1 ratcheted up accusations that @entity22 was involved in downing the plane , it also opened criminal cases against @entity4 's defense minister and a @entity4 businessman , calling both " accomplices of terrorists			1
" the @entity342 accused @entity4 defense minister gen. @entity343 of helping form " illegal military groups " in the @entity311 region , where @entity39 rebels have declared their own government			1
" the illegal military groups , which are led by citizens of the @entity4 , make regular attacks on government institutions and other organizations that have led to multiple human deaths , destruction and other consequences , " the ministry said in a statement			2
and the ministry accused @entity4 billionaire @entity360 of financing the " illegal military units			2
" @entity4 officials have repeatedly denied involvement in fomenting violence in the region			2
a june profile on @entity360 by @entity367 noted that the " self - proclaimed head of the unrecognized @entity370 and its rebel army leader have both worked for @entity360 , though the financier denies any role in the unrest			0
" earlier this month , @entity1 opened a criminal case against the head of @entity4 's @entity377			1
the ministry 's statement tuesday contained no specific references to the downing of @entity6 17			0
who are @entity1 's @entity39 rebels ? @entity1 president : the world must choose sides so much we do n't know -- five unanswered questions who were the victims ? should jet have flown over @entity1 ? @entity2 's @entity392 reported from @entity0 ; @entity393 and @entity394 reported from @entity395 ; and @entity2 's @entity396 , @entity397 , @entity398 , @entity399 , @entity400 , @entity401 , @entity402 , @entity403 , @entity404 , @entity405 and journalist @entity406 contributed to this report .			2
