-- most parents have felt the pain of having a missing child , if only for a few seconds			1
they lose sight of their child at the park or at the grocery store or at the mall			1
fortunately for most moms and dads , as soon as the knot forms in their stomach , they lock eyes with their kid			1
but for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year , that pain is much deeper ; for some , there is never relief			1
working in the media , i 've followed the cases that get national attention			2
i 've watched the press conferences and the family statements			2
last week , however , i had the heart - wrenching experience of finding out what happens in between the media updates -- what it feels like when this is real life			2
a sweet 14 - year - old girl who babysat my son in the church nursery was missing			1
she 'd left home without her parents ' permission to meet up with a boy she connected with online			2
the boy said he never went to their rendezvous point , a park , and as of thursday , the young girl still had not come home			1
the days in between were grueling for those involved in the search			1
i can not fathom the depth of emotion her parents experienced			2
hope in the search for missing children police never suspected foul play and thought the girl might have run away			1
that scenario was both frustrating and encouraging			2
it was frustrating because the family did not think she intended to be gone long			2
she did n't bring anything with her			2
no phone , no keys , no money			2
it was encouraging because it was the best case scenario			0
maybe she " just " ran away			0
maybe she was fine -- angry , confused , and unaware of how loved she is -- but fine			0
the conversations that unfolded were surreal			0
we talked to a detective about the possibility she was involved in sex trafficking or abducted or even worse			0
we had to avoid focusing on the " what ifs " in order to stay focused on the search			1
when word got out , the community rallied around the missing teen and her family			1
we plastered the city with fliers and canvassed her last known whereabouts			0
people who had never met the family joined the search			1
dozens of homeless people in the area helped out			0
as the story spread on social media , people around the world sent words of support			0
those of us on the ground did everything we could think of , all while having no idea what we were doing			0
three days after the girl went missing , i was helping plan a prayer vigil			1
we did n't know where to begin			0
we " guessed " the parents should speak first , before things got too emotional			0
but what should they say ? how do we get the word out ? how long should it go ? we did n't know the answers to these questions			0
the prayer vigil never happened			0
about an hour before it was to begin , the young girl was located			1
she had run away , and she was home now			0
for the media , that 's where the story ends			0
a quick update to tell local tv viewers everything is ok			0
opinion : most missing persons cases do n't have happy endings for the friends assisting with the search , there was a huge sense of relief			1
there were hugs , tears , and then the exhaustion and gravity of the week hit			0
we laughed -- about how much trouble this girl is in , about how much wine we planned to drink			1
after this experience , i 'll never look at news of a missing child the same			1
i will hold this experience close the next time an e-mail about a missing child crosses my inbox			1
i will remember the reality behind the story			0
each missing child poster represents a family in heartache and a community at a loss .			1

when a child goes missing , a community comes together
@entity0 editor @entity168 *participated* in search for missing girl
you have to *ignore* " what if " scenarios in order to stay focused , she says
behind every missing child poster is a similar heartache
