-- nearly 69 years ago , @entity1 navigated a @entity3 @entity2 called the @entity4 over @entity5 , @entity6 , on a sunny august day			1
once over its target , the @entity4 unloaded the first atomic bomb dropped in war			1
a single bomb blast killed some 140,000 people and helped end @entity12 -- and pushed the world suddenly into the nuclear era			1
on monday , @entity1 died of natural causes at the @entity18 retirement community in @entity19 , @entity20 , according to his eldest daughter @entity21			1
his death means there are now no surviving members of the @entity4 's crew who , by doing their jobs , became an early and integral part in the ongoing narrative over nuclear weapons			1
@entity12 's atomic bombs while in the @entity3 military , @entity1 flew dozens of missions in @entity33 and @entity34			2
yet the history books will largely remember him and others aboard that @entity2 for the morning of august 6 , 1945			0
by then , @entity1 had flown about 15 missions out of @entity38 and about 10 more out of @entity34			2
he then returned to the @entity3 with new orders , training " primarily to make the rapid turn and running away from the bomb , " @entity1 recalled decades later to @entity0			1
they dropped the bomb dubbed " @entity44 " around 8:15 a.m. " you did n't see anything except a bright flash and the airplane , " @entity1 recalled			1
" you saw a white cloud hanging over the city			0
you saw the -- underneath the cloud the entire city was just entirely covered with smoke and dust , and it looked like a pot of boiling oil down there			0
" his first thought when the bomb fell was " ' @entity63 , i 'm glad it worked ... number two , the thoughts were , ' this war is over			2
' and that was good			0
' " three days later , another atomic bomb was dropped on @entity71			2
@entity6 surrendered soon after that , ending the bloody war in the @entity74 and , in so doing , preventing a @entity3 land invasion			2
@entity5 atomic bomb memorial site attracts tourists , shares history with new generations it also set the stage for what would become known as the @entity85 -- a nuclear arms race between the @entity86 and @entity3 that would go on for decades -- as well as concerns about developing nuclear weaponry that persist in places like @entity91 and @entity92 to this day			1
@entity93 told @entity0 on tuesday that his father " felt no regrets about " the @entity5 mission			0
at the same time , he said " @entity98 " @entity1 's life was much more than that			1
after the war , @entity1 left the military , got his master 's degree in chemical engineering at @entity105 , then had a long career working for @entity107			1
he retired in 1985 -- a decade after his wife 's death -- and remained active , eventually settling in @entity20 near one of his daughters			0
he will be buried in @entity112 -- the central @entity114 city in which he was born -- alongside his wife , @entity93 said			0
together , the couple had four children , seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren			0
" we treasure the fact that we had my dad for 93Â½ years , " said @entity93			0
" he was a great father			0
" people we 've lost in 2014			0

@entity1 dies in @entity20 at age 93 , his daughter *confirms*
he was on the crew of the @entity4 , which dropped a nuclear bomb on @entity6
his *son* says " @entity98 " @entity1 had no regrets about the mission
afterward , he had four children and worked for decades at @entity107
