@entity0 -- i like it when i 'm right , especially about naked men			2
a federal judge 's opinion includes side - by - side photos of the key players in the naked cowboy case			1
when i wrote in april that the lawsuit filed by @entity11 " may be the end of the era of the " naked " cowboy and predicted he would be able to afford some " very nice duds , " my fellow lawyers laughed at me			1
one close friend -- let 's call him @entity21 -- said as he snickered , " i read your article			2
you ca n't be serious			0
you really think that the @entity11 is going to cash in ? well , i predict he is going to get thrown out of court			2
if he does n't , maybe i will start walking around my office in my tighty whities			0
" last week , @entity29 district court judge @entity28 did n't throw the cowboy from his steed			2
in fact , in a lengthy decision , judge @entity28 ruled against the makers of @entity35 , rejecting @entity37 's attempt to dismiss the cowboy 's lawsuit			1
and it seems that @entity28 has a sense of humor			0
on the first page of his decision , the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties @entity46 and wrote , " this is the case of the naked cowboy versus @entity49			1
" and what a case it is			2
@entity11 sued @entity37 in april for $ 6 million in federal court in @entity0			1
the central allegation : trademark infringement under the @entity55 , arising from a video billboard for @entity35			1
most people , and maybe @entity37 , thought the cowboy was just a kooky street entertainer dressed in his underwear			1
however , i 've spoken to mr. cowboy , i mean , mr. @entity62 , and he did n't seem kooky to me at all			2
in fact , he seemed kinda smart			0
even judge @entity28 recognized that the naked cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer			1
although he performs in @entity0 's @entity65 in little more than underwear and a smile , he has registered trademarks to " the naked cowboy " name and likeness			1
and he does n't just sing in @entity65			0
he has a web site @entity73 / with his modeling photos and has a link to nakedcowboy.tv			0
you can download his music on @entity78			0
you can buy his tighty whities from his online store for $ 15			0
he even has a podcast			0
judge @entity28 observed that " @entity11 has appeared as the naked cowboy in various television shows , movies , and video games			1
he has also licensed his name and likeness to companies for endorsements and advertisements			0
he even appeared in a @entity92 commercial that aired during @entity93			0
judge @entity28 then explained that " beginning in april 2007 , @entity37 began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in @entity65 , featuring a blue @entity49 dressed " exactly like the naked cowboy , " wearing only a white cowboy hat , cowboy boots , and underpants , and carrying a guitar			1
" and get this -- the video " played on a continuous loop every few minutes over a nine - month period			2
" @entity37 tried to defend itself by arguing that the @entity49 was just a parody of the cowboy and was protected under the @entity106			1
although imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery , judge @entity28 did n't agree with @entity49 's parody argument			1
rather , judge @entity28 thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint " plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the @entity115 characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying the naked cowboy , and that viewers would believe that the naked cowboy had endorsed @entity35			1
" then judge @entity28 ordered the lawyers to appear in his courtroom for a pretrial conference on july 11 at noon			0
that @entity28 makes me laugh			0
@entity21 , maybe you should start walking around the office in your tighty whities .			0
