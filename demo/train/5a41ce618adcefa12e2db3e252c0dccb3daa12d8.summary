@entity0 -- president @entity2 weighed in on the scottish independence referendum wednesday night when he tweeted in favor of a united @entity5			1
but for the most part , faced with the prospective divorce of its closest friend , the @entity6 is following the advice column carefully : do n't take sides , keep your opinions to yourself , and avoid getting dragged into the fray			2
the complicating factor in this potential split ? one side has a nuclear arsenal			0
who gets custody of that ? thursday 's independence referendum in @entity24 , and with it the possible split of the 300 - year - old @entity5 , could have consequences big and small , including in the @entity6			1
the " special relationship " heralded by presidents and prime ministers for decades would be fundamentally altered , though @entity6 officials refuse to speculate in which ways			0
as @entity5 prime minister @entity32 said on tuesday , a " yes " result on independence would amount to a " painful divorce " between @entity24 and the rest of @entity37 , not a " trial separation			1
" that prospect has elicited only a few sentences of official @entity6 reaction			0
president @entity2 said in june the @entity5 had been an " extraordinary partner " to the @entity6 and had done well for itself as a combined entity			1
" we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains strong , robust , united , and an effective partner , " @entity2 said then			1
" but ultimately these are decisions that are to be made by the folks there			0
" opinion : @entity24 , you want out ? we 'll take your place those few words -- with the emphasis on " united " -- have been repeated by officials in @entity0 as the formal @entity6 stance without any further explanation			1
but there 's little doubt the @entity6 government , from @entity2 on down , wants to see @entity24 remain where it is			1
" it would just be rude to comment on the internal deliberations of a democratic country , " explained @entity68 , a former @entity69 official who is now a fellow at the @entity70 in @entity0			0
" of course the @entity6 has an opinion			0
i think they recognize , however , that stating that opinion is not always even very helpful to promoting it			0
" rules of diplomacy aside , @entity6 officials are eyeing the referendum vote carefully two days before @entity24 head to the polls			1
here are a few ways the @entity6 could be affected by a " yes " vote			0
photo blog : @entity24 teens face historic vote national security it 's only been two weeks since @entity2 and @entity32 hailed a reinvigorated @entity93 alliance from a golf course in @entity95			1
should @entity24 vote to go it alone , expect fresh questions about @entity93 's ability to counter @entity99 in @entity100			2
all of @entity37 's nuclear weapons -- its only contribution to a @entity104 nuclear deterrent -- are housed at the @entity106 's base on @entity24 's @entity107			1
a " yes " vote would throw into question the future of the @entity112 nuclear program , which consists of four @entity114 - class submarines armed with ballistic missiles on lease from the @entity6 the main pro-independence party says it opposes nuclear weapons , vowing to remove and ban them in a future @entity24 state			2
where the weapons would go remains an open question			0
opinion : why @entity5 would miss @entity24 also in dispute : an independent @entity24 's ability -- and willingness -- to contribute to @entity104 military coalitions , which have become ever - more visible as the @entity6 rallies support behind its efforts against @entity99 and @entity132 terrorists in @entity133 and @entity134			1
@entity93 chief @entity135 said this week that @entity24 would have to reapply to join the group like any other country and gain approval from each of the 28 member states -- a tough - to - imagine prospect in a period when the appetite for expansion within @entity93 remains low			0
@entity5 party leaders promise @entity24 new powers ahead of independence vote in rejoining the alliance @entity24 would need to commit to spending 2 % of its gross domestic product on defense spending , which given the uncertain economic outcome of an independence vote appears unachievable			2
" this is less about the nuclear deterrent than about demonstrating weakness and disunity at a critical point in @entity93 's history in the face of a sort of newly resurgent threat from @entity99 , " @entity68 said			0
" the whole idea of one of its key members breaking up ... does n't really appeal to the @entity6 at this critical moment in dealing with @entity99			2
" economy the uncertainty surrounding the economy of an independent @entity24 could wind up costing @entity6 , who enjoy a close - knit trade relationship with @entity37 and the larger @entity169			1
a main sticking point in the referendum campaign remains which currency a @entity24 state could use -- be it the pound , @entity175 , or something new			0
banks based in @entity24 have said they 'll decamp to @entity178 if the " yes " votes prevail , and an already - shaky @entity181 financial recovery could be quickly halted			0
" if @entity24 votes for independence , expect significant turmoil not just in the @entity188 , but on @entity189 as well , " @entity184 , a former aide to the late @entity5 prime minister @entity185 , wrote in the @entity186 last week			0
" fears over the economic fallout from @entity24 breaking off from the @entity5 will spook @entity6 markets , frighten investors , and add to an air of uncertainty exacerbated in recent months by @entity99 's invasion of @entity197			1
" would go - alone @entity24 be richer outside @entity5 ? perhaps the greatest fear for the @entity6 is that a successful independence movement in @entity24 could spark further movements in the rest of @entity100			1
potential breakaway regions in @entity203 and @entity204 are already eyeing the @entity24 vote carefully			0
those regions , like @entity24 , would face questions about what currency they 'd use and how their economies would be structured , driving the @entity169 -- a major @entity6 trade partner -- into further uncertainty and economic turmoil			2
what to know about @entity24 's vote on independence			2

@entity6 is n't saying a lot about potential @entity24 independence
@entity2 tweeted he 's interested in " strong , robust , united " @entity37
an independent @entity24 would have consequences for @entity6
