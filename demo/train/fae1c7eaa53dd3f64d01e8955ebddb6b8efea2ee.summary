@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a country as small as a newborn baby is tiny , the birth of @entity4 has been a very big deal for @entity1			1
" @entity4 was born pure , was born a @entity1 citizen , " explains his happy mother , @entity8 , as she holds her nearly 2 - month - old baby close			1
" he was not born a sectarian person			2
" @entity8 calls that accomplishment " a step forward for a better @entity1 " and " the result of a long struggle			1
" you certainly would n't know from glancing at @entity4 's uncluttered birth certificate -- a simple document that belies the complexity of his status			1
@entity8 points proudly to a line that would normally denote her son 's sect			1
but on this historic , yet flimsy little square of paper , it 's been very deliberately left blank			2
that may sound easy , but in a country of 18 different faiths spread amongst less than five million people , it was anything but			2
@entity1 's government relies heavily on a sectarian political balance to maintain a very tentative peace			1
it 's a system that always seems fraught with peril for its population			0
@entity4 , whose name in @entity42 means " my future " , is n't old enough to worry yet			0
his parents dream of a future where he 'll never have to			0
@entity8 , a @entity47 , and her husband @entity48 , who is @entity49 , never wanted a religious wedding ceremony			0
but civil marriages are n't legal in @entity1			1
committed as much to each other as they were to their cause , @entity8 and @entity48 took on political and religious leaders -- fighting a two - year battle from engagement onward in order to become the first couple to be granted a civil marriage license in @entity1			1
amidst the country 's confessional system of governance , one whose politics have become more fractured as its sectarian lines have grown deeper , it looked on many occasions like they might not win out			1
but despite strong opposition and multiple threats , they persevered			0
the law still has n't been changed but momentum is now growing to change it			0
@entity8 and @entity76 's marriage license was approved last april , and they have n't stopped pushing the envelope since			1
but in @entity1 , where religion can mean the difference between life and death , love and birth are n't always celebrated			1
" somebody talked to me on @entity88 , " @entity8 tells me , " and said ' i will turn your baby into blood because he 's an illegal baby ' based on his point of view ... saying ' you wo n't see him growing up -- you will see him killed some day between your hands			2
' " it 's difficult to imagine how anyone could see @entity4 as a threat , yet sectarian tensions have long existed in this country -- one that experienced a brutal 15 - year civil war , and one that is being drawn deeper every day into another civil war in neighboring @entity104			1
just last week , two suicide bombs rocked @entity0			0
over the summer , dozens were killed in blasts targeting both @entity47 and @entity49 strongholds throughout the country			0
it 's no wonder @entity48 is so fearful for his family			0
" it 's very hard because , when @entity8 and i started down this path , we got threats , but it did n't make a difference to us , we were proud of what we were doing and the steps we were taking , " he says			2
" but since @entity4 arrived we 've started to feel scared			0
" the family that wants to change @entity1 may now have to leave it			2
as they consider relocating , they grow sadder and more worried			0
" you end up living a life of fear , " says @entity48			0
" i just constantly want to protect @entity8 and @entity4 , " he adds , " hold them close and not let them go			0
" " we are trying now to apply for immigration somewhere else where we can be protected as human beings and [ where we can keep ] our human and civil rights , " @entity8 says			0
this is the sad reality of @entity1 : a beautiful baby whose arrival was meant to bring hope may now need to depart a divided country that could use that hope more than ever .			1

@entity1 parents *refuse* to mark baby 's sect on birth certificate
parents have received threats in @entity1 , a country deeply divided on sectarian lines
parents also fought two - year battle to get first civil , *non-religious* marriage certificate
divisions among sects in @entity1 deepen as @entity104 's civil war spills into country
