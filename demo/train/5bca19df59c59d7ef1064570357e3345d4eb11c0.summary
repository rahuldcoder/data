editor 's note : join @entity2 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity4 at 11:10 a.m. et wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			0
a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 has said he will vote for @entity8 in november			2
he is the author of " listening to the @entity9 " and " speak , @entity10 ! a @entity12 's view of @entity13			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
@entity2 says the @entity17 campaign has done @entity18 a disservice by keeping her hidden			1
( @entity4 ) -- is @entity20 gov. @entity18 running for vice president of the @entity13 or vice president of the student council ? listening to some political strategists , pundits and radio and tv blowhards , you would think that all she has to do is show up , sign her name on the roll , and she 's done enough to satisfy the requirement for president			1
do people really and truly understand that she will be sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency , backing up a 72 - year - old guy who has a history of cancer ? nothing drives me nuts more than listening to some of these folks who act as if we should n't expect @entity18 -- and @entity46 vice presidential nominee sen. @entity45 -- to be well - versed on national issues , foreign policy and the social and cultural issues that have to define @entity13			1
conventional wisdom says that the vice president means nothing and that the voters going to the polls between now and november 4 are really voting on sens. @entity8 and @entity17			1
ireport.com : what would you ask @entity18 , @entity45 ? but looking at the role that the last few vice presidents have played , especially vice president @entity62 , it is clear that the vp can make a world of difference and that we should be demanding the tough answers to tough questions from both candidates			1
now , the blowhards have been going on and on , suggesting that too much attention is being paid to her gaffes and not to those of @entity45			0
but what we have learned this election season is that there are double standards			0
countless folks have said that we all know @entity17 , and it 's necessary to scrutinize every aspect of @entity8			1
really ? i think if you ask the average person , they 'll know a lot more about @entity8 's childhood than @entity17 , solely by the level of scrutiny			1
the truth is , the nation does n't know much about @entity18			2
and when folks do n't know a lot about you , there is an expectation to get to know more			0
as for @entity18 , i fundamentally believe that millions of @entity13 want to know what she thinks about the critical issues of the day and not from reading cue cards			1
the @entity17 camp has done her a huge disservice by treating her like a @entity103 egg , totally untouchable			1
she needed to do multiple media interviews and not keep an arm 's distance from the media and , yes , the general public			2
back to that low expectation thing			0
the reality is that the @entity17 camp and republicans want that			2
even @entity45 and the @entity8 camp are tamping down expectations , hoping that if the bar is set just above someone 's ankle , it will be easy to cross			2
now is not the time for low bars and low expectations			0
we need our candidates to think big and be big			0
they need to speak to our concerns and our fears			0
and yes , @entity45 has been around a long time , and many say they know what to expect from the loquacious one			0
but @entity18 must strut her stuff			2
thursday 's debate will not be read from a teleprompter			1
it wo n't be on cue cards			0
with the nation watching , she is going to put up or shut up			0
what is most at stake is whether she 's the subject of further ridicule or can show @entity13 that she has a strong command of the issues			1
if she can do the latter , she validates @entity17 's selection			2
if not , she calls into question his judgment , and at this stage of the game , that is not a good thing			0
