@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you look at @entity0 , there is the modern side and the traditional side , but they all interact with each other			1
if i 'm in the car , i can go from one place to another and see different backgrounds , different people and different surrounding -- and for me this is always interesting to show in my work			1
i have seen it growing -- more buildings , hotels and lots of architecture being constructed all the time			1
it has changed rapidly over the past 10 years			1
i think i am lucky to see it all happen because now if there is an extra building , i would not really notice it ! i have seen it all change			1
it is part of who i am			2
there is always that other side of @entity0 where it is very simple , humble and down - to - earth , regardless of who you are			1
i think it is always important to see the original @entity0 , how it used to be , and a lot of it is still there			1
i do n't mind having these modern architectural buildings			2
it was more of a desert over here with tents and small houses , so there was n't really much to preserve			2
our job was to build more and i think @entity0 has that balance where there are the old and the new areas			1
i 'm very interested in artisans of the region because few of them exist			2
i always like to work one - to - one with craftsmen and recreate what they are making			1
i try and look for traditional materials			2
i would take a traditional material and maybe wrap it around a @entity61 car ... or fit it on an art platform in a new way			2
i would call myself a multidisciplinary designer -- i use more than one medium at the same time			2
more from @entity66 : how ' @entity69 ' @entity68 artist brings characters to life sometimes an old @entity1 man will come and whisper in my ear : " is n't this a gargour ( traditional fishing trap made of steel ) ? " and i would say , " yeah			1
" for me this is what i am trying to do -- show my work to people who maybe are not from an art background			2
@entity0 is an art fair that happens every year in march			1
i was an artist - in - residence in 2012			1
the residency program is located in @entity85			2
there are a couple of old buildings that are turned into art spaces			0
i wanted to do something connected to the area , so just a couple of blocks away , if you walked through @entity95 ( one of the oldest most traditional districts of @entity0 ) you would see the fabric shops and i remembered the textile shops from my childhood			1
my mum would get fabrics and i think this was where my interest in art and colors started			0
there is usually a cardboard tube that they wrap around the fabric and ... so i said , " can i use them ? " i ended up collecting about 50 a day from different shops			0
i created stools and chairs that you could arrange in different ways as modular furniture			0
more from @entity66 : @entity119 artist who transforms bottle tops into masterpieces i was also very interested in the wooden hand barrows that are used to take these fabrics from one shop to another			1
most of the hand barrow men -- known as haath gadi wallahs -- can only speak @entity128			0
i convinced one of them to work with me like a performance and i took him into @entity95 which has very narrow streets			0
but right now instead of having fabrics on that barrow , it has got an art piece on it made out of cardboard tubes			0
to me it is the juxtaposition of history with something from the present			0
people were interacting with it really nicely , asking questions as they saw it moving around , others thought he must have lost his way from the souq and that is what i wanted to achieve			0
i called it prayer on a wheel			0
this is an example of how i tend to do my work -- take something from our past that is still used in our present and then redesign it in a new form and give it a new function -- and most of the time it is an artistic function -- to reintroduce it again			0
recently i wanted to explore the gargour			0
they used to make them out of dry palm leaves but now they make them out of metal wire			0
with the help of craftsmen we joined the fish traps together to make a full sphere			0
the name of it was @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 -- defining that this tool of fishing that was in the past can still be used in the present and can continue to be used in the future			0
more from @entity66 : @entity191 sculptor @entity190 's painful search for truth i think @entity1 artists are trying to invent their identity and create a regional style for @entity0			1
it is less challenging when you are a woman because they always think that art is your feminine side			0
i would like to see a lot of collaborations with @entity1 and international artists or designers			1
( @entity206 designer ) @entity207 created a light sculpture out of palm leaves with the help of @entity1 artisans ( at the recent @entity212			1
) i would love to do this one day			0
people would see the possibilities we have got here			0
i think collaborations are very powerful because they mix the media from different backgrounds and when you put them together there are a lot of unexpected results .			1
