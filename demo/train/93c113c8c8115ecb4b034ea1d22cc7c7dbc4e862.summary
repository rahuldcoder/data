-- he puts the gun to the woman 's head , pulls the trigger and watches as her body hits the floor			0
a @entity10 - winning footballer with @entity11 and a lauded defender , @entity8 is now executing @entity14 collaborators			1
" it 's the first time i 've killed anybody , " @entity8 reveals to @entity0 , reflecting on a dramatic career switch -- and also recent reversal in his new life as an actor			1
" it 's a change as i 've been killed a couple of times			0
thankfully , @entity8 's victim is fictional and , rather than a new life as his character @entity28 , a member of the @entity30 resistance , the former @entity25 defender is reflecting on a new career on the silver screen in the movie allies			1
from day one , football and film were his two great passions , and both consumed him with equal force			0
" the posters on my wall were @entity45 and @entity46 alongside @entity47 and @entity48 , " he recalls , referring to two @entity30 football greats , a former @entity40 and one of @entity11 's great cinematic heroes			1
" i think my first passion when i was younger was shared with my mother ... the movies			2
" i loved watching plays as well but there was n't much chance to pursue that in a small @entity30 village but my father created a football academy in our village and that was it			1
" each day , be it returning home from school or football training , the first thing he would do -- even before removing his coat -- was to plant himself in front of the television and watch a movie			2
" it 's like two careers is n't it ? one for my father , one for my mother , both for me , " said the 46 - year - old as he talks about the opportunity to pursue his two great loves			0
@entity8 is also currently treading the boards in @entity30 theater with a role in @entity81 , @entity82 et @entity83 ( my mother - in - law , my @entity87 and me ) , a comedy in which he plays the role of the straight man			1
" the similarity with both is that i always complain about performance in both , " said @entity8 as he talks about the demands of professional sport and acting			2
" after a match , even if we won i 'd be unhappy about a missed pass			0
after a play , i 'll be like ' i was s * * * ' or else think how i did n't deliver a line properly			0
having earned 50 caps for @entity11 and man - marked @entity102 striker @entity101 out of the @entity105 final , @entity8 is candid enough to admit an actor 's life does n't quite give him the same adrenalin rush he experienced as a footballer			1
" films are not the same as it 's a slow process and the theater is different as it 's not like playing in front of 90,000 people			0
" in this play , i have to deliver a line for the funny man and it has to be right or else his subsequent line is n't funny as it does n't make sense			0
" so there 's that pressure to deliver which is maybe the same in football			2
you have to be precise			0
" his big break as a thespian came when he was still on @entity25 's books in 2001			1
@entity130 , who won the @entity131 for best adapted screenplay for another @entity134 film @entity133 in 2002 , approached him to get involved in a film version of his play taking sides			0
the chance to act alongside @entity139 and @entity140 , planted the thought in @entity8 's that he might pursue an acting career when his footballing forays were over			1
in 2005 , he relocated to @entity144 for acting classes and he still has a home there			0
it was while on holiday in the @entity149 that he received a script for @entity151 , having to deliver his audition via his iphone with his wife			0
to his surprise he bagged the part			0
" i never thought i 'd get the part as it seemed like a bad job but i got a call to say that @entity162 [ @entity161 , the director ] wanted me in the movie			0
" @entity8 is not the first @entity30 footballer to have pursued an acting profession after hanging up his boots , with the former @entity25 defender following in the footsteps of @entity169			1
the @entity174 @entity173 star 's @entity171 - speaking roles include a part as a @entity30 aristocrat in the 1998 movie @entity178 , which was nominated for seven @entity131 , and more recently in @entity179 's @entity180 about a postman who hallucinates that his idol , @entity169 , follows him and gives him advice			1
" i do n't know him , " admitted @entity8			2
" i played against him at the end of his career when i was at @entity25 and we played in the national team , one of the last times he played for the team			2
" i know his younger brother better but not him but i 've still followed his career			0
" there 's obviously a parallel between what we 're doing , and he 's a great example of how to be a success from football to acting			2
" he might have won the @entity10 and @entity199 with @entity11 as well as six trophies for @entity25 , but @entity8 is clearly a man that looks ahead rather than to his past successful sporting career			1
so much so that that his @entity10 winners medal was in the glove box of his car for a year until his son unearthed it			0
a player who arrived in @entity209 in 1996 as a relative unknown on @entity171 shores for a fee of Â£ 2.5 million from @entity213 to become a fans ' favorite , @entity8 still describes himself as " @entity25 's @entity217 fan			1
" " i do n't get to @entity218 to watch as much as i might like			0
i had to miss the @entity25 - @entity220 match on tv the other night as i was on stage but the first thing i do as i come off stage is to check the scores			1
" his beloved @entity25 are currently top of the @entity227 in @entity171 and are top of @entity228 in the @entity229			1
" for me , at the beginning of the season , i felt the @entity227 would be between @entity25 and @entity232 , and i believe it to be the same , " he adds			1
" of course , it would be more desirable if it 's @entity25 and they look good , and in the @entity229 too			1
of course , yes , the double is possible			0
" @entity238 had asked to be given a year to get the squad he wanted and to deliver , " added @entity8 , referring to the @entity25 manager			1
" @entity238 desperately wants to win the @entity229 for @entity25 and he has put himself under pressure to do that			2
he wants to do that to add to the @entity25 legend			2
" in his own way , @entity8 was one too , even if the @entity218 faithful , however , might struggle to recognize him in his current guise			2
@entity151 is available on dvd and digital download from 3 november courtesy of @entity250			0

@entity8 has gone from delivering passes to delivering lines
now a stage and movie actor , @entity257 defender 's latest role is to fight the @entity260
he admits to a dual passion for both movies and football growing up in a @entity30 village
still an avid @entity25 fan , he tips the @entity209 club to win the @entity227
