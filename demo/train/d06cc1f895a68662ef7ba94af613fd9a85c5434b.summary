-- a large @entity4 nuclear plant is out of commission indefinitely , and will remain so until there is an understanding of what caused problems at two of its generators and an effective plan to address the issues , the nation 's top nuclear regulator said friday			1
@entity15 , chairman of the @entity16 , refused to give a timetable as to when the @entity19 nuclear plant could resume operation			1
he said only that his agency had " set some firm conditions " as to when that could happen			0
" we wo n't make a decision ( to approve the facility 's restart ) unless we 're satisfied that public health and safety will be protected , " @entity15 told reporters			1
" they have to demonstrate to us that they understand the causes , and ... that they have a plan to address them			2
" the power plant has been shut down since this winter , when a small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator during a water leak			1
at the time , federal regulators said there was no threat to public health , though they could not identify how much gas leaked or exactly why it had happened			1
the water leak occurred in thousands of tubes that carry heated water from the reactor core through the plant 's steam generators			2
leaks occur periodically in older units , but plant owner @entity52 replaced the four steam generators at @entity19 in 2010 and 2011 as part of a $ 680 million project			1
they are in units 2 and 3 of the nuclear facility ; unit 1 went out of service in 1992			0
each of the 65 - foot - tall , 640 - ton generators -- built by @entity65 's @entity64 -- are packed with thousands of narrow tubes that carry hot , pressurized water from the reactors			0
the heat produces steam in a separate loop that drives the plant 's turbines and generators			2
" tubes are vibrating and rubbing against adjacent tubes and against support structures inside the steam generators , " the agency noted			0
eight of the more than 9,700 tubes in one of the unit 3 generators failed a pressure test , while six tubes in unit 2 's reactor needed to be plugged , the @entity16 has found			2
another 186 tubes in unit 2 , which was shut down for refueling at the time of the leak , were plugged " as a precautionary measure			0
" in addition to driving the turbines to create electricity , the steam generators are " one of the barriers between the radioactive material in the reactor core and ultimately the external environment , " @entity15 noted			0
located near @entity105 , the @entity19 nuclear plant 's twin reactors are " @entity4 's largest and most reliable sources of electricity , " according to @entity52 's website			1
when operational , the facility -- which is owned by that utility , @entity111 and the city of @entity113 -- supplies power for 1.4 million households at any given time			0
anti-nuclear activists gathered friday , not far from where @entity15 , sen. @entity118 , @entity119 , and rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , toured the power plant , to question the need for nuclear energy and raise alarms about a potential environmental catastrophe			1
@entity128 , founder of the group @entity130 , said that such public pressure was needed in order to guard against a nuclear crisis along the lines of what happened last year at @entity65 's @entity137 plant			1
" if we were to let things go as they 've gone in the past , it 's very likely that we 'd experience a @entity137 right here in @entity4 , " @entity128 said at the rally			0
" and that 's why we 're here today			0
" @entity0 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0

new : anti-nuclear activists warn of a potential environmental catastrophe
the @entity19 nuclear plant has been shut down since radioactive gas escaped
*officials* have said there 's no harm to the public health , but ca n't identify problem 's cause
the head of the @entity16 says the plant wo n't restart until a cause and plan is put *forward*
