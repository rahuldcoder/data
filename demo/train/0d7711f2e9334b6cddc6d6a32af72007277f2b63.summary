growing up , @entity0 hoped to escape poverty by finishing school and becoming a teacher			2
but now 52 years old and having never finished school , she wishes she had learned a few things			1
" if i knew back then about the choices in family planning , i would 've been able to control having children , " said @entity6 , who has 12 children			1
" if it were up to me , i would n't want to have so many			2
but i did n't use family planning , so basically they just kept coming and coming			2
" she eventually heard about the birth control pill from neighbors , but did not know how it worked			1
moreover , she said she could not afford it			2
" instead of spending money on those , i use it to buy food , " @entity6 said			2
her story is a familiar one in a country where 81 % of @entity25 are devout @entity26 and 30 % live below the poverty line , according to the @entity29			1
while contraception is legal , the majority , like @entity6 , do not have access or the means to afford birth control			1
but that could all change			2
after 14 years in limbo , a controversial landmark legislation called the @entity40 bill could bring major changes in the country of almost 96 million people			1
the proposed law requires the government to provide contraceptives , information on modern family planning methods at public health centers and comprehensive reproductive health curriculum in schools			1
national surveys show 65 - 70 % of @entity25 support the bill , but it faces fierce opposition by the country 's @entity26 leaders			1
lawmakers are trying to negotiate a compromise , by addressing some of the strongest objections to the bill			1
the bill 's co-author congressman @entity62 stated that amendments are in the works to emphasize that reproductive health services and information would be geared to the " poorest and most marginalized households			1
" " in order to obviate the unfounded criticism that the government will distribute contraceptives for free to everyone , the amendments will underscore that only the poorest of the poor will have free access to contraceptives if they are willing acceptors , " @entity62 said in a press release			1
a dozen children in @entity6 's small home in @entity85 , a poor neighborhood in @entity86 , she and her family sleep , cook and eat inside one room			1
seventeen people share a cramped 12 - square meter room , one person next to another			2
although limited in space , the room has a sense of order			2
an array of slippers in different sizes sits next to the front door			2
the family has one mattress and the rest sleep on the floor , covered with cardboard , mats and blankets			2
two pieces of plywood serve as a bed and a desk for one of her children			2
during the interview , her sleeping grandchild curled next to her teenage father , using a pair of adult shorts as a blanket			2
the walls are covered in family photos			2
@entity6 is most proud of the school pictures showing three of her children , which bear the word " graduate , " showing that they finished elementary school			2
@entity6 hopes that unlike herself , her children will have choices			2
national statistics show that the @entity25 population is growing at 1.98 % and that it could reach 105 million by 2016			1
the growth rate is not the problem , said @entity136 , the @entity25 representative to the @entity137			1
" it 's about the quality of life available to the segment of the population having the most children , " she said			2
" poor women are the ones having more children			1
so as the @entity25 population is growing , it 's growing poorer			1
" @entity6 first became pregnant at 17			2
since then , she ca n't recall when she did not struggle to provide basic needs for their children			0
her husband , a carpenter does not have steady work			0
" if we earn money , they eat , " she said , referring to her children			0
" if we do n't , they have nothing to eat all day			0
most days they just bear with it			0
even when they go to school without food			0
" " i find it so hard when they go to school without food , without money			0
i just want to cry most times			0
" with no one else to care for her growing family , @entity6 stayed home to watch her children			0
her adult children struggle to find work , because they did n't graduate from high school			0
" the older ones had to stop going to school so the younger ones could start " , @entity6 said			0
but her children appear to be entangled in a familiar cycle			0
just like @entity6 , her daughter became pregnant at 17			0
her son became a father when he was 18 , and her 17 - year - old son is expecting a child soon			0
the health bill , @entity6 said , would give her youngest the means to " understand what happens with their bodies			1
" young people in the @entity25 lack health services and education , said @entity136 from the @entity137			1
this has caused a problem of skyrocketing teen pregnancy rates in the @entity25 , which are the second highest in @entity199			1
" we are also failing the young people in the @entity25 , " she said			1
" ideally it 's a time when young people are focused on education and skills - the things they need to live productive lives			1
instead , we have a situation where children are having children			0
" a pack of condoms cost about 50 pesos and upwards , and birth control pills start at 100 pesos			1
when @entity6 's husband can find work , he earns about 350 pesos a day			0
condoms are sold in convenience stores and groceries , and pills are available , but they 're harder to find in remote areas			0
the health bill would make various forms of birth control free and available to the country 's poor			1
it would help quell the dramatic rise in maternal mortality rates , which has increased from 11 women dying per day to 15 , from 2006 to 2010 , said @entity136			0
it would also help address the fact that the @entity25 is one of seven countries in the world where @entity236 rates are increasing , according to a @entity137 report			1
proponents of the @entity40 bill say it is about human rights , health and sustainable human development , not religion and sex			1
church resistance the @entity26 hierarchy has seen the bill differently - saying that artificial birth control is a sin and its distribution will relax moral standards			1
" preventing fertilization is not a surgical , but a chemical or medical abortion , " said father @entity254 , executive secretary of the @entity255 , of the @entity256 of @entity25			1
" it 's like okay , go ahead			0
as long as you do n't get pregnant or you do not impregnate anyone , you can have any physical relationship			0
it will destroy the trend of marriage in our country			0
and slowly when you bring down the bar of morality , everything follows			0
" @entity254 said the government is infringing on territory beyond its authority by " legislating an immoral law , " and maintained that the state should not intervene in the moral and religious realm			0
but @entity6 , who is catholic and regular church - goer disagreed			0
with a faded print of @entity282 and the @entity283 hanging on a wall behind her , the mother of 12 said , " the choice is yours if you need them for your own family , your own life			0
when you use them , it 's not like you 've sided with evil			0
" the battle over the health bill has both @entity297 officials and lawmakers accusing each other of overstepping boundaries between church and state			1
the bill in its previous five attempts at passage , has languished in @entity306			1
the stiff resistance from the @entity26 , which is influential in politics , has prevented the passage of the bill , said @entity311 , national chairperson of the @entity312 , which supports the health bill			1
in the past , politicians have hesitated openly supporting the bill in fear of going against the @entity26 and damaging their chances of re-election , she said			1
" legislators are called on regularly by bishops , one by one , and some priests visit legislators in their districts , to ' convince them ' to drop support or strengthen their opposition to the bill , " she said			2
for years , politicians have feared the @entity26 's moral influence on voters , said @entity330 , professor emerita at @entity331 , @entity332			1
" there are two kinds of @entity26 in the @entity25 , the unthinking - who say i do n't need to read that bill because my priest is the guardian of my morality and whatever they say goes			1
and the thinking -- who will study the issues , follow their own conscience , and do n't let anybody try to sway that , " she said			0
but father @entity254 denies that the church gets overly involved in politics			0
bishops issue guidelines when @entity26 decide whom to vote for , but they do not openly endorse political candidates , @entity254 said			1
" it 's up to the voters to ask themselves if this particular candidate possesses those needed criteria to lead our nation			0
" " in the final analysis , no one can stop the priest when they want to do it			0
but they will never be ordered to do so by the bishops , " he said			0
but @entity330 said the @entity25 is a different country today compared to when the bill first tried to fight its way to the legislative floor 14 years ago			1
" it 's no longer a one - sided , unidirectional situation , where the hierarchy says something , it goes down and everybody says ' amen , ' " she said			0
for @entity6 , a lifelong @entity297 , the issues are simpler			0
her greatest fear is that her children will end up trapped in the same life she has known			0
" i do n't want them to be like me , " she said			0
" i do n't want them to go through what i have			0

@entity40 bill would make birth control free for poor in @entity25
@entity26 has opposed bill , which has been proposed for last 14 years
many lack proper health education and birth control access
