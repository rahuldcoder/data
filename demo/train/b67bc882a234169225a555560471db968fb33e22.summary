news that a jury has ordered @entity2 and @entity3 to fork out $ 7.4 million in damages and profits for allegedly drawing on @entity6 's 1977 hit " @entity10 " in their song " @entity12 " has thrust the issue of music copyright into the headlines			1
but it 's by no means the first time			1
recently , it was reported that @entity16 and @entity17 would be given songwriting credits for @entity20 's hit song " @entity21			1
" but the really interesting part was that this only happened after @entity16 's team noticed a likeness between @entity20 's song and @entity16 's 1989 hit " @entity27			1
" astonishingly , this means @entity20 , and somehow every single person at every stage of the production process of " @entity21 , " were all -- to a person -- apparently not familiar with the 1989 @entity16 / @entity34 tune			0
it makes this old - timer think : wait , how did anyone release that song and not think it sounded like @entity16 's " @entity27 " ? i assumed it was a collaboration ! the only plausible explanation is that every executive , every studio employee and every human involved in that decision was under 30 and had never heard of @entity16			1
" @entity27 " does n't get a lot of play time now , but in 1989 , you could not have avoided this song			0
@entity47 played videos pretty much nonstop back then , and this one accounted for about 20 % of the content on @entity47 -- or at least it felt that way			0
to this author , and amateur music infringement sleuth , the songs are almost identical			1
but , it turns out music -- and music similarity -- is almost entirely in the eye of the beholder ( or " be-hearer " )			1
other songs that have ' blurred lines ' in a music plagiarism case , one musician claims that another composer has " stolen " his pre-existing song			1
the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the challenged composition ( 1 ) is substantially similar , and , further , ( 2 ) that this similarity is due to copying			0
the challenge is that even if the plaintiff can prove song similarity , the plaintiff usually has no evidence that the accused composer actually heard the song in advance			0
so , music infringement presents a tricky question : should a court find that the defendant infringed the plaintiff 's song just upon a showing that the songs are similar or identical -- despite the plaintiff 's inability to show that the defendant ever actually heard the song ? instead , plaintiffs generally prove this element by showing that the person who composed the defendant 's work had " access			1
" examples of " access " are where a plaintiff 's song has been widely disseminated , either by public broadcasts , widespread distribution and even the publication of sheet music			1
if a composer and his work are not famous , naturally it 's harder to prove access to a musical composition that has largely been distributed no further than a dog - eared notebook in mom 's basement			1
it 's hard to hold a defendant liable for infringement solely because the piece is similar , and courts are reluctant to do so			1
at the same time , " access " today is much easier to prove than it was before the @entity125			0
if someone has five fans on his aspiring - rapper @entity131 page , and he posts songs recorded right onto his macbook , can it be said that a @entity20 had " access " to that music when he records a nearly identical tune ? after all , technically , it was only a click away on the @entity125 , just not a click that anyone was likely to make			1
the advent of the @entity125 means artists now have " access " to everything , at any time			0
surprisingly , courts have held that in cases of the unknown , un-famous plaintiff , the " access " may be inferred where the plaintiff proves the similarity between the songs is both substantial and striking , and also that the similarities could only have come from copying , and not coincidence			0
so , in an era where every song ever composed is online , at our fingertips , it all boils down to a collective smell test			0
and if you have ever seen @entity166 defend his accused theft in " @entity168 " of @entity169 and @entity170 's classic sound in " pressure , " you know that there really is not much difference between " @entity175 - @entity175 " and " @entity177 - @entity176			1
" ( here 's the link to that piece of tape , for no other reason than it 's a fantastic example of self - delusion			1
) the fascinating thing is that the music business is full of these alleged song robberies			1
since music is so personal , whether the listener hears the old song in the new depends heavily on the individual 's music preferences and knowledge			1
if you are proficient in the art of blues or rock chord progression , for example , you may recognize that the famous @entity199 canon by @entity200 , is almost identical chord-wise to @entity203 's ' 90s hit " @entity204			1
" this , even though no one would confuse the feel or genre of " @entity204 " with @entity200 's wedding classic			2
on the other hand , if ( like my @entity209 ) you think all rap music sounds like " pots and pans clanging together , " then you may not have the palate for differentiating between rap , hip - hop , house or trance			2
the point is , music theory may be a hard science , but music appreciation is anything but			2
as a result , music comparison is all over the map			2
for example , in 1971 , former @entity229 @entity228 was sued for supposedly pilfering the @entity232 song " he 's @entity234 " for his hit song " @entity236			2
" @entity237 " he 's @entity234 " right now and listen			2
" identical or different ? the chords are substantially similar in both verse and chorus			0
the fact that the songs are from different " eras " is either a minor distinction to you , or dispositive of any claims			0
the reality is that once you start playing these songs for different people , you find that because we all perceive music differently , there may be no objective way ultimately to determine if any song ever infringes another			2
after all , is n't all music inspired by something that came before it ? sure , each side can call experts in music theory at trial to testify about the circle of fifths , and tonal harmony this and arpeggio that			2
but those experts would still be explaining it to a lay judge , jury and even lawyers			2
these laypeople are all individuals , all experiencing music differently			2
and in the case of the @entity232 ' song and @entity228 's " @entity236 " ? the court ultimately determined that @entity228 's use of parts of the @entity232 ' song , in the same order , sequence and harmonies , meant @entity228 subconsciously misappropriated " he 's @entity234			2
" is that how you would have called it ? play it for your spouse or kids and see what they say			0
you may find they disagree with you			0
this kind of dispute appears whimsical , but it actually has serious economic implications			0
music is protected by copyright , which , along with trademarks and patents comprise an area of law known as intellectual property			0
a copyright is just an expression of an idea in a fixed , tangible medium , which means a song , a painting and even software code is entitled to copyright protection			0
the most paradoxical thing about intellectual property law is that it incentivizes creativity and invention by rewarding creators with a limited monopoly ... and nothing destroys ingenuity more than monopoly			0
the line must be carefully drawn , because the loser in a copyright case may be out some major damages in the form of royalties			0
in the case of @entity20 's use of the @entity16 work , to @entity20 's credit , his team reportedly listened to the two songs and acknowledged the similarity			0
and in a rare moment in music infringement history the parties actually settled the matter amicably			1
of course , for me , the key lesson in all this is that knowing @entity16 's music now seems to mean that i am officially old			1
which means it 's time to retire my acid - wash jean jacket with the @entity345 patch			0
even worse , though -- if potential litigants such as @entity20 and @entity16 are going to start resolving disputes without hiring us lawyers , then i might have to retire my law license along with the denim jackets .			0

jury has found that ' @entity12 ' drew on @entity6 's ' @entity10 '
