-- the irony was not lost on most viewers of the @entity5 prime minister 's statements as he replied to the public outcry over the hasty shutdown of @entity9 , the country 's national broadcaster , with the immediate layoff of over 2,600 employees			1
like a wolf in sheep 's clothing , @entity14 was chastising a system that his own @entity19 had helped to ingrain in @entity5 society and political life			1
speaking at an award ceremony organized by the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , he labeled @entity9 a " symbol of corruption and waste , " and claimed it " controlled the flow of information without any accountability			1
" constantly repeating righteous keywords such as " transparency , " he tried to justify his decision to pull the plug on @entity9 's national and regional tv channels and radio stations around the country , which @entity5 taxpayers had been paying for for the past 75 years			1
newly - unemployed former @entity9 employees rebutted these attacks by issuing a statement revealing publically what had been common knowledge in @entity5 's journalistic circles : the final word always lies with the heads of the organization -- appointed by mr @entity14			1
namely , they pointed out " it was the general director of @entity9 @entity49 who decided that the anniversary of the @entity53 newspaper was more newsworthy than the tortures at @entity55			1
" last october , in an article that led @entity5 public order minister @entity58 to threaten the @entity59 with legal action , anti-fascist protesters claimed they had been tortured by the police at the @entity62 ( @entity55 )			1
the @entity55 denied the claims			0
back then , the government that now champions transparency , went so far as to suspend @entity9 's morning show hosts , @entity67 and @entity68 for criticising @entity58 's response to the incident			1
only after this week 's announcement of @entity9 's closure , under a @entity74 , did its employees feel free to broadcast uncensored			2
only in the final hours before the shutdown was economist and writer @entity77 able to reveal on tv that he had been banned from that very channel for two years , and that on one of his appearances , tv presenter @entity81 had asked him not to mention the words " debt restructuring			0
" of course , a portion of the public were aware of government - imposed censorship , and some even endorsed @entity14 ' recent drastic move			0
but in a country where unemployment has reached a record 27.4 per cent and cronyism has been the rule of the day for decades , it 's slightly naÃ ¯ ve to believe the coalition government leader 's claims of cleansing and of a will to reinstate transparency			0
the shutdown was met with mixed feelings , not just among the viewers but also among the journalists themselves , with some complaining about @entity9 's lack of support towards the rest of the media world that had been facing layoffs and company closures for more than three years			1
" the journalists should have already revolted on behalf of the pensioners , " one commentator said			0
this attack on freedom of speech , still reverberating in the @entity5 and international press , has also divided the fragile coalition government itself			2
the leaders of the other two junior coalition parties , @entity124 and @entity125 , say they oppose @entity14 ' decision , but are open to a reasonable compromise			0
the @entity19 leader needs their support for his decision to become law -- the alternative will render the coalition unsustainable			0
@entity124 leader @entity134 said his party " does n't want elections , but we 're not afraid of them either			0
" speculations about an imminent general election is already circulating in the @entity5 press , but @entity134 and @entity125 leader @entity141 ' need to cling to power is likely to make them go along with @entity14 ' decision			2
they might try to buy time , since at the moment international attention and support for @entity9 is overwhelming			2
the absolutist way in which @entity14 chose to act on his decision triggered a media revolt which was long overdue , with blogs , websites and @entity152 streaming @entity9 's service online			2
@entity155 ' executive director @entity154 deplored the closure , explaining that such media shutdowns are " usual in dictatorships and rare in democratic countries			0
" the question of whether @entity5 , formerly known as the cradle of democracy , still lives up to the title is a persistent one			1
what is certain is that the current form of democracy is deeply flawed and , unsurprisingly enough , the media and the way they have operated for decades are part of the problem			0
but switching off the state broadcaster will only exacerbate the problems , derailing democracy			1
a publicly - funded broadcaster is by definition crucial to media pluralism , simply because it does n't have to make the financial choices privately - funded ones face -- especially in a country where the owners of private media firms are business magnates , whose aim is to influence the political world			2
@entity14 and his coalition partners lack any credibility that would make a cleansing of the organisation possible			0
the @entity5 pm might claim he wants to get rid of the " corrupt " and " sinful " @entity9 only to establish a new , efficient organisation with only 1,000 employees , but the question is , given the track record of his party , who believes him ? " we have a short span memory , we @entity5 , " he said last wednesday			1
he must surely hope so			0
