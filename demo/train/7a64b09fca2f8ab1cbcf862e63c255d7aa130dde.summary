@entity0 -- @entity0 point guard @entity2 pleaded guilty friday to illegally possessing an unlicensed handgun in the @entity4 in a locker - room incident last month			1
the 28 - year - old @entity7 all - star told @entity9 judge @entity8 that he understood he could receive up to five years in prison when he is sentenced on march 26			1
but @entity2 ' attorney , @entity11 , told the court that the government will ask for no more than six months , under the terms of a plea agreement			1
" he accepted full responsibility for his actions , acknowledged that those actions were wrong and against the law , and has apologized to all who have been affected by his conduct , " @entity11 said in a written statement			1
the government has agreed to limit its recommendation to the low end of the guidelines -- " estimated to be between six and 24 months , with probation , a split sentence , or incarceration permissible , " @entity28 attorney @entity27 said in a written statement			1
" playing with firearms is no joke , " said @entity27			0
" such reckless action can always be expected to garner a swift and firm response from this office			0
we commend mr. @entity2 for accepting responsibility and hope he fully appreciates the gravity of his actions			1
" the government statement said the incident was traced to a flight from @entity44 , @entity45 , on december 19 , when @entity2 and a fellow teammate " became involved in a verbal exchange after a card game			1
" " although @entity2 maintains that the statements he made during this exchange were made in jest , the exchange between @entity2 and the teammate involved mutual threats to shoot one another , " it said			1
" @entity2 also told the teammate that he would burn the teammate 's @entity57			1
" two days later , @entity2 entered the team 's locker room at the @entity62 carrying at least one firearm in his backpack , the statement said			1
" once @entity2 entered the locker room , he placed four firearms on the chair located directly in front of the locker of the teammate with whom he had the prior verbal exchange			1
@entity2 then wrote the message ' @entity73 ' on a piece of paper , and placed it on the teammate 's chair near the firearms			2
@entity2 remained in the locker room			2
" moments later , the teammate walked into the locker room and approached his locker			0
he saw the handguns and he and @entity2 once again exchanged words			2
during this exchange , @entity2 stated , ' you said you were going to shoot me , so i thought you would like some firepower			0
' the teammate picked up one of @entity2 's firearms from his chair , threw it across the locker room , then reportedly took out what appeared to @entity2 to be a silver - colored semi-automatic handgun			1
" after this exchange , @entity2 admitted to team management that he brought the firearms from his home in @entity100 into @entity95 also told team management that the teammate also had a firearm			2
the teammate has since denied that he ever had a handgun			0
team management directed @entity0 security personnel to secure @entity2 's firearms and to remove them from the premises			0
" the incident came to light on december 24 , when authorities were notified , the statement said			0
metropolitan police went to @entity2 ' home in @entity100 , where the athlete 's four unloaded firearms -- a .50 - caliber gold - plated , semi-automatic @entity118 with magazine ; a .500 @entity115 revolver ; a .45 - caliber black , semi-automatic @entity123 with magazine ; and a 9 - mm @entity126 with magazine -- were surrendered , it said			2
the three - time @entity7 all - star said he told authorities that he had stored the guns in his locker in the @entity62 to keep them away from his children			2
" i brought them without any ammunition into the @entity4 , mistakenly believing that the recent change in the @entity4 gun laws allowed a person to store unloaded guns in the @entity4 , " @entity2 said in his statement			1
he offered a public apology at the time to the league , his teammates and his fans , saying , " i promise to do better in the future			0
" during friday 's court proceeding , the usually jocular @entity2 appeared somber			2
dressed in a dark pinstripe suit , he neither smiled nor spoke as he entered and left the courthouse			0
the judge ordered him to surrender his passport and said he could not possess any firearms while he awaits sentencing			0
@entity2 ' indefinite suspension remains in effect until a separate @entity7 investigation is complete and commissioner @entity156 reaches a decision on whether to reinstate him , a source said thursday			1
the league investigation , which had been on hold at the request of federal prosecutors , will now resume , the source told @entity1			0
in a statement this month , @entity2 described the incident as " a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate , " and said , " contrary to some press accounts , i never threatened or assaulted anyone with the guns and never pointed them at anyone			1
joke or not , i now recognize that what i did was a mistake and was wrong			0
" citing @entity7 sources , the @entity175 reported in december that the teammate who allegedly also brandished a firearm was @entity178			2
@entity178 's agent , @entity179 , has told @entity1 that his client " has n't done anything wrong			0
i 'm extremely confident he 'll be exonerated			0
