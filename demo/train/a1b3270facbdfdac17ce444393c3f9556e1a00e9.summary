@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 accused of killing two @entity1 men is n't a diplomat , as @entity4 officials have said , but rather a @entity9 contractor in the country providing security for @entity9 officers , a @entity4 government official said monday			1
the revelation that @entity14 was working for the @entity4 intelligence agency when he shot two men -- one of them in the back , according to @entity20 police -- is a dramatic twist in a case that has already inflamed hard - line clerics and an angry public that wants the @entity4 tried in a @entity1 court			1
in protests since @entity14 ' arrest last month , hard - line @entity1 clerics have condemned the shootings and demanded that the government not release the @entity4			2
despite the revelation of @entity14 ' true line of work , @entity4 officials on monday renewed their argument that he enjoys diplomatic immunity and must be released			1
@entity4 officials notified @entity1 that @entity14 had been posted to the @entity37 in @entity0 in january 2010 , @entity4 officials said			1
@entity1 's only recourse under international law is to order @entity14 out of the country , according to a senior @entity4 official who briefed reporters on background monday			1
" any other form of action , including a judicial action or any other proceeding , is inconsistent with his status , " the official said			0
@entity14 was jailed january 27 after fatally shooting two men who pulled up to him on a motorcycle in a bustling @entity20 neighborhood			1
@entity4 officials and @entity20 police said @entity14 told them he shot the men in self - defense			1
evidence showed the two men may well have been robbers , according to police who found cash and cell phones linked to a robbery reported earlier that day			0
but @entity20 's police chief , @entity61 , has said witnesses told police that @entity14 kept firing , even when one of the men was running away			1
" it was clear - cut murder , " @entity61 told reporters			0
that @entity14 was working for the @entity9 as a contract employee seems to explain the assortment of gear @entity20 police reported finding in his rental car following his arrest			1
according to a @entity20 police report , @entity14 ' car contained 9mm pistol , five ammunition magazines , two cell phones , an infrared light , a digital camera , a telescope , a long - range wireless set and a survival kit			1
while acknowledging that @entity14 is a @entity9 contractor , the @entity4 official said that @entity14 is not a case officer or paramilitary officer			1
" @entity14 is a protective officer , someone who provides security to @entity4 officials in @entity1			1
rumors to the contrary are simply wrong , " the official said			0
the @entity4 official added " any suggestions that he was conducting covert operations or personally leading efforts to target militant groups is wrong			2
" but the official said @entity14 could have been providing security for @entity9 officers who were engaged in covert operations @entity14 is part of the agency 's " global response staff , " which is responsible for protecting the safety of @entity9 operatives in other countries			2
he was doing " advance work , " scouting areas of @entity20 at the time of the shooting , the official said			2
@entity14 ' role required him to " know the environment			0
" he provided all facets of security for case workers including surveillance detection , route surveillance and protection in potentially hostile environments , said the official			0
the 36 - year - old @entity14 is a former member of the @entity118 special forces and had been employed by security firm @entity119 , previously known as @entity119			0
@entity14 began working for the @entity9 nearly 4 years ago			2
he was assigned to @entity1 in late 2009			0
he was living with other security personnel at a safehouse in @entity20 before the shooting incident			0
until monday , @entity4 officials had described @entity14 only as an employee who was attached to the @entity37 in @entity0 and who was working at the @entity4 @entity126 in @entity20 at the time of the shootings			1
formally , they continue to describe him only as a member of the " technical and administrative staff " of the embassy			0
the @entity4 government has had ongoing conversations with @entity1 's government about @entity14 ' security , @entity133 spokesman @entity132 said monday			1
" clearly , we hold the government of @entity1 fully responsible for his safety , " @entity132 said			0
a @entity4 official said @entity14 is being held in a facility with 4,000 other prisoners , some of them militants			2
@entity1 officials have moved @entity14 to a separate part of the prison and taken away guards ' guns for fear one might kill the @entity4 , the @entity4 official said			1
dogs are even being used to taste and smell @entity14 ' food to ensure he is not poisoned , according to the official			0
sen. @entity153 , @entity154 , chairman of the @entity155 , recently traveled to @entity1 in part to express " our deepest sorrow for the loss of life " and underscore @entity14 ' diplomatic immunity			0
members of @entity163 have told senior @entity1 leaders that billions of dollars in @entity4 aid are in jeopardy unless @entity14 is released			2
but @entity132 said monday no such action is currently being contemplated			0
the @entity4 supplied more than $ 1.5 billion in nonmilitary aid to @entity1 in fiscal year 2010			0
