8 , which bans same - sex marriage ; and one on the federal @entity12			1
regardless of how the justices rule on these issues , i 'm pretty sure 2012 or 2013 will be remembered as the " year of the gay			1
" republicans , business leaders , the president -- everyone seems to be coming out in favor of lgbt rights			2
the culture shift ( in most parts of the country ) has been incredible			1
how did that happen so fast ? it used to be political suicide ... @entity29 " ? can you say that ? can i say that ? what are the parameters here ? i 'm genuinely curious ... is " gay " as a noun offensive ? for example : " the gays are interested in today 's @entity3 case			1
" or is it the " the " that makes it feel like a sword of political incorrectness cutting through the conversation ? i need help here @entity1			1
@entity1 : the gays say it all the time ! usually half - sarcastically			1
it 's one of those appropriation things			2
picture a preacher shaking a fist and railing about " the gays ! " it 's designed to steal their thunder			0
so i ca n't use it until i come out			0
while i agree the culture is shifting , it has n't yet shifted			2
and i fear the outcome of today 's @entity3 case could stop the shift in its tracks			1
this is a fear held not only by conservative and liberal legal scholars , but also by one of the @entity3 justices			1
justice @entity71 has said the @entity3 " moved too far , too fast " with @entity72 and should n't have struck down abortion laws in " one fell swoop			1
" it 's not that she disagreed with @entity72 , just that she recognized the backlash of freezing the abortion debate in cryogenic chamber for the last 40 - plus years			2
i think this tells us two things : 1			0
) a grand pronouncement from the @entity3 puts an end to the debate at the ballot box and could push both camps into their polar foxholes			1
) it suggests the court may look for a narrow decision , possibly just affecting @entity9 , on whether states can ban gay marriage			1
one thing it does n't tell us is what is right or wrong or where the legal arguments should take the court			2
only the effect the @entity3 has on society			1
as for how this is all happening so fast ... that 's a great question			0
it took thousands of years for society to settle on the fact that slavery was wrong			0
this by comparison is taking place over a 50 - year time period			2
what do you think ? @entity1 : on the " the gays " thing : you can use it anytime			1
you have the blessing of the gays			0
( at least one ... ) on the court : i hope the justices are influenced by right and wrong â€” not by what they fear will be the reaction of the public			2
i hear ya on the kick - back point			2
a pro-same - sex marriage opinion would make lots of people angry			1
and there are plenty of corners of the country where being gay is still not ok ( i went to one recently for this op - ed on the " county where no one 's gay " )			1
but i hope the justices realize legalizing same - sex marriage would strengthen families and support inclusion / equality			1
both of those sentiments would trickle down through @entity4			0
and , after the initial freakout , we 'd all be better people for it			0
as for why this happened so fast ? no clue			0
but i 'd guess @entity149 ( @entity150 ) had something to do with it			0
@entity29 : @entity149 , @entity2 from " @entity156 , " @entity153 , @entity154 from " the @entity155 , " @entity152 ... actually i 'm not sure the last two have done anything to advance acceptability			1
we joke , but those people played a big role because they made it easier for ... " your gay friend			2
" and " your gay friend " has had a huge impact on how society views the gays			2
( see , i tried out " the gays " thing			0
) look , i support gay marriage from a policy / voting booth perspective			1
i also happen to think that gay marriage bans like prop 8 are violations of the @entity177 's @entity176			1
and i suspect including gay marriage under the umbrella of " marriage " will strengthen families			1
but i 'm not sure			0
that was a big part of the @entity3 hearings			1
we have very little data on the effects of same sex marriage and - for example - the effects on child rearing			1
the question then became : is caution a valid state interest to discriminate ? @entity193 asked this question			0
ultimately , i think not			0
but i think it 's a worthy question			0
@entity1 : i 'll go ahead and disagree with you on that			1
asking whether same - sex marriage is fully blessed by social science is like asking , in 1967 , whether data support interracial couples getting married , or being parents			1
i get why it 's coming up , but it 's offensive on some level			0
ask kids who were raised by same - sex parents			1
many will say , as this kid did during a hearing in the @entity215 , that they 're doing just fine			2
plus there are lots of same - sex couples who would want to get married and do n't want to have children			1
the more fundamental question is whether @entity223 people are equally human			0
and if so , why our laws do n't reflect that			0
@entity29 : i think one of the fundamental divides between progressivism and conservatism is conceit versus humility			1
your anecdotes of kids raised by same - sex parents or the kid at the @entity215 hearing are compelling			1
but they are still anecdotes			0
and as @entity195 , @entity193 , @entity197 , and @entity241 all recognized today ... we have 5 years of data on gay marriage versus 2,000 on traditional marriage			1
this is all to point out that the position ( a position i hold ) that gay marriage wo n't have detrimental effects should come with some humility			1
we ca n't see the future			0
you are right that " detriment to child rearing " was the same argument used to support bans on interracial marriage			2
the argument was wrong then			0
and i suspect it 's wrong now			0
my point is : i do n't think this is a compelling reason to discriminate			0
i do n't think the procreation reason , the harm - to - traditional - marriage reason , or the tradition reason are compelling reasons to discriminate			1
but i say that humbly			0
@entity1 : @entity264 , brother			2
so what do you expect the @entity3 to do about all of this ? @entity29 : not much			1
here are the four potential paths the @entity3 could take with prop 8 : 50 state solution - declare that all state bans on same - sex marriage are unconstitutional			1
this does not look likely for all the reasons we 've discussed			0
9 state solution - declare that you ca n't get halfway in			2
this requires states that recognize civil unions to recognize those unions as marriages			0
if the justices liked anything less than the @entity287 , it was this option			0
they seemed to feel that it punished states who afforded gay couples more rights than those who offered gay couples nothing at all			2
@entity9 only - declare that you ca n't grant marriage rights and then take them away , as happened in @entity9			1
this seems likely to me as they ruled similarly in a @entity300 case			0
reject the case - the justices did n't even seem to want the case before them , questioning if anyone had " standing " to bring the case			2
if they find there was no standing to appeal this case it will effect , essentially , the @entity9 only option			0
so i do n't think much will happen outside the state of @entity9			0
and this debate will continue			0
@entity1 : you may be right on the outcome , but every day this legal debate drags on is a big slap in the face to the notions of equality and fairness that were the founding principles of this country			1
simply because of who they are , gays and lesbians are n't allowed to get married in most states , can be fired for their sexual orientation in 29 , can be evicted from their homes in just as many			0
as i 've written for this site before , these laws create a climate of fear that keeps people hidden , encourages gay people not to speak out and contributes to disproportionate rates of suicide and homelessness in the lgbt community			2
@entity223 people , i 've argued , live in 50 @entity340			0
it 's completely unsustainable and unfair			0
just hope it 's sooner than later			0
ready for me to drop the mic ? have anything you want to add ? thanks for having this discussion , by the way			0
i tell you something though @entity1 , when it comes to @entity12 , it did n't seem like the @entity3 wanted to talk about any of the issues we just discussed			1
they did n't want to discuss equal protection much at all			0
the justices pressed for a source of federal power to regulate marriage			2
without that @entity12 goes down			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity365 and @entity29 .			1
