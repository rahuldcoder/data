, you know that a certain @entity6 - based fruit company has finally unveiled its entry into the smartwatch sweepstakes , and , as expected from the house that the late @entity10 built , the new @entity1 watch is a bushel of insanely geektastic features wrapped up in a sleek and eminently gorgeous package			1
you can get the scoop on what it actually does ( and whether you should drop your hard - earned $ 349 " to start " on it ) elsewhere			1
the question i 'm interested in is whether @entity1 's long - awaited arrival in the buzzy wearables category finally means that people -- regular people , that is , not pixel - pushing pundits and @entity27 - driving tech titans -- are ready to wear them			1
the fact is , while wearables have generated a lot of attention , they 're being used a lot less than the fanfare might suggest			2
according to the @entity34 and @entity35 , only about 14 million fitness bands and activity trackers and about 2 million smartwatches were sold globally over the 12 months ending this past march			0
( everything else -- @entity40 , cloud cameras , digital jewelry , wi - fi socks , connected underwear -- basically represents a rounding error			2
) compare that with the number of smartphones sold around the world : 964 million			0
that 's the difference between a niche product and an emerging necessity			0
now , there are pretty good reasons why people have so far failed to adopt wearables in droves			1
the first is that this first generation of devices have been , in the larger scheme of things , pretty useless			0
or single use , at most : fitness trackers may be invaluable for dedicated dieters and exercise junkies , but most people do n't have room in their personal digital portfolios for another device that does nothing but count steps and calories			1
it 's one more thing to update , charge , sync and misplace			0
( i had a @entity78 when it first came out -- accent on the " had			0
" it 's currently counting turbulence jolts on a plane somewhere between here and @entity83			0
) hands - on with the new @entity1 watch but the second and most critical reason is that technology needs to reflect demand , not supply			1
are consumers actually hungry for what you 're cooking ? if they are n't , your smart [ insert device category here ] is an interesting idea , not a product			1
it 's an answer looking for a question			0
and it is designed to make nerd fanboys and technology columnists wet their pants , not to change the way ordinary people live			0
every game - changing innovation , from the horseless carriage to the first cell phone to streaming video on @entity109 , is one that fulfills a fundamental need so well that it 's hard to imagine what it was like before that innovation arrived			1
of course , you often do n't realize this until well after the innovation in question has been released			0
@entity1 's original @entity119 , with its featureless oblong form factor and touchscreen - based @entity121 , was derided as an expensive , keyboardless toy			1
the @entity123 was dismissed as an oversized iphone with a feminine - hygiene inspired name			0
both of these ended up completely reinventing their categories and earning @entity1 billions			1
the @entity130 , meanwhile , received a standing ovation when it was unveiled tuesday as the " one more thing " behind @entity1 's new supersized @entity119 , and has been generating a near - universal stream of acclaim from the digerati ever since			1
people across my social network have been focusing their lust on different aspects of the device -- from its fashion - focused interchangeable bands to its ability to serve as a wave - and - enter key for rooms at @entity147 , to perhaps the weirdest feature it offers : its ability to send a real - time pulsing display of your heartbeat to any contact on your paired @entity119			2
( at the very least , that 's going to change the face of action cinema			0
) which may answer my original question : while other companies are trying to figure out how to respond to need , @entity1 , more so than any other company , has figured out how to create it			2
just now , my mom called me to ask if i thought she needed an @entity130 , to go along with her new iphone 5c			2
if you needed an indicator as to whether the wearable revolution is finally here , that 's as good as any .			2

@entity1 unveiled the long - awaited @entity130
@entity171 : does @entity1 's foray into wearables mean people are ready for them ?
he says even though wearables are buzzy , consumers have n't *flocked* to them in droves
@entity171 : @entity1 , with its focus on design , may have found a way to start the wearables revolution
