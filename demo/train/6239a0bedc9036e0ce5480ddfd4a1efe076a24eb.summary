-- the norse god of thunder makes his big - screen debut in the latest @entity5 movie , the first of three heading our way this summer			1
portents are good for future developments , but director @entity11 makes heavy weather of the back story			1
if you 're not up on your @entity17 mythology , @entity14 is the guy with the hammer and the tempestuous temper			1
in @entity23 's resurrection , his father , @entity21 , punished @entity14 's recklessness by condemning him to a double life as dr. @entity26 , a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind			1
the movie gives us a brand new deity who is also a bit of both			2
the story teeter - totters between the exiled @entity26 crash - landing in @entity37 -- where he 's immediately run over by @entity41 's storm - chasing astrophysicist , @entity42 -- and @entity43 , where he vies with half - brother @entity45 ( @entity46 ) to vanquish the @entity47 ( not a hockey team ) and win the respect of their father ( @entity50 , gamely trying to inject some @entity53 - like gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets )			1
an unholy combination of a @entity58 penthouse and @entity60 palazzo , @entity43 is a computer - generated valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing @entity65 views of the cosmos			0
a vast waterfall drains out into space , and an electric highway allows the gods to drop in on any of the nine realms , one of which is @entity74			0
the stereoscopic scenery is impressive , but the screenwriters have a tin ear for god - speak , settling for something between @entity80 and the @entity81			2
presumably this is why @entity5 turned the reins over to @entity11 , whose credentials include " @entity85 , " " @entity86 " and " @entity87			1
" @entity11 has a penchant for back - slapping bluster and bravado , as well as the kind of kinky camera - angles that make you wonder if someone 's tripod has lost a leg -- which pretty well describes the movie 's exhaustingly lop - sided first act			1
" @entity26 " is on much safer ground here on @entity74			2
the tone is immediately different : more relaxed ; comic , not cosmic , as @entity42 and her colleagues ( a wisecracking @entity103 and mistrustful @entity105 ) figure out whether the blond muscle man who fell to @entity74 is a lunatic or a miracle			0
in this incarnation , @entity26 has lost his power tool -- the hammer affectionately known as @entity114 -- but he has kept his wits about him and takes his new circumstances in his stride			2
@entity118 : " @entity41 should give her @entity119 back " beefy @entity121 newcomer @entity120 seems to be channeling the young @entity11 in his portrait of an impetuous , gallant alpha male , burning to be king			1
there 's no finesse in the performance , but broad strokes are all it takes ; the other actors just bounce off him , and the movie finds its sense of fun			0
but it never settles for long			0
all the substantial plotting takes place on the astral plane in @entity43			0
the @entity37 episodes feel like a sideshow			0
@entity118 : fans rave for " @entity26 " in essence another plank in the elaborate foundation work for the forthcoming " @entity145 " movie , what " @entity26 " sorely lacks is a center of gravity			2
on the other hand , it is as spectacular as $ 150 million can buy and very much at the milder end of the @entity152 spectrum			0
it should hook legions of kids , who can look forward to years more thor ­ -- probably bigger and better ­ -- in the future .			0

@entity14 , the norse god of thunder , gets an *updated* look
newcomer @entity120 plays @entity26 ; @entity41 is his love *interest*
*shakespearean* actor @entity11 directs the film
