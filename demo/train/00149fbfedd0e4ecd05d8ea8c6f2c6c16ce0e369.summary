-- @entity1 plans to put laboratories in space , collect samples from the moon and prepare to build space stations over the next five years , according to an ambitious plan released this week aimed at putting the country on the global map for space exploration			1
@entity1 also plans to launch manned - vessels and freighters into space during the coming half - decade , according to a government white paper			1
the country 's eventual goal in the longer term is a manned lunar landing			1
" with economic progress , also comes the need for scientific development and exploration , " said @entity19 , a professor at the @entity20 and space sciences at @entity22			0
" by investing in space exploration , @entity1 wants to contribute and be a major player in the world on more than one level			2
" the @entity1 plans announced this week come as the @entity32 has been scaling back its ambitions and funding for space exploration			1
since 2003 , @entity1 has made major breakthroughs in its space program , including becoming the third country after @entity39 and the @entity32 to put a human in space			1
it successfully completed a spacewalk in 2008			0
in november , the successful automated docking and return of an unmanned spacecraft , @entity46 - 8 , paved the way for the creation of @entity1 's future space laboratory			1
the spaceship blasted off from a launch facility in the @entity52 in northwest @entity1 , one month after the first space laboratory module @entity54 was launched into space			2
@entity1 says its military - run space program will be used for peaceful purposes			2
but its activities have set off controversy in the past , like when it shot down one of its dead satellites in 2007 , for example			0
that move alarmed some officials in the @entity32 and other countries and raised concerns about the militarization of the space race			2
some experts say a critical gap in @entity1 - @entity32 space relations is the absence of regularized talks on space security , which took place between @entity76 and @entity77 during the @entity78			1

" the ball is now in @entity1 's court to respond			1
how it responds may say a lot about its true intentions in space			0
" two more space docking missions are planned for 2012 , with at least one of them manned			0
but despite the progress , some experts say @entity1 still has a long way to go in developing its space technology			2
" @entity1 is still catching up to countries that began their space programs in the 1960s , " said @entity19			0
" it may be impressive to see what @entity1 has done in the past decade , but there is still a long way to go			0
" the paper also says @entity1 will develop technology to monitor space debris , study black holes and develop small satellites for environmental and disaster monitoring and forecasting .			0
