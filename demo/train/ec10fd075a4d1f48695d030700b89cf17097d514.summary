-- in the dark of night , @entity2 helicopters approached a high - walled compound in @entity5 on a mission to capture or kill one of the world 's most notorious terrorist leaders			2
less than 40 minutes later -- early monday morning in @entity5 -- @entity10 was dead , along with four others inside the complex , and the @entity2 forces departed with the slain @entity16 leader 's body to fulfill a vow that originated shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity2			1
and as he announced the raid at the @entity21 sunday night , @entity2 president @entity19 called @entity10 's death " the most significant achievement to date in our nation 's effort to defeat @entity16			1
" one senior administration official called the investigation a " team effort " and a " model of really seamless cooperation " across agencies			1
this official and others briefed reporters on further details about the assault on the compound , which they believe was built five years ago for the specific purpose of hiding @entity10 -- known by the code name " @entity43 , " a @entity2 official said			1
a senior administration official said later that " @entity43 " was code for the act of capturing or killing @entity10 , not the man himself			1
the compound is in @entity49 , about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) north of the @entity5 capital of @entity51			0
the city sits in a mountainous region that is not heavily populated			0
many of the residents are army personnel			0
while senior administration officials would not offer a breakdown of the @entity2 mission 's composition , a senior defense official said @entity61 were involved			1
after years of intelligence work and months of following a specific lead , they traced a courier linked to @entity10 to the compound in @entity49 , the officials said			1
when first built , the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road , the officials said			0
in recent years , more residences built up around it , but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area , they said			0
the mission ordered friday by @entity19 found outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire , with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound , the senior administration officials said			2
the main structure was a three - story building with few windows facing the outside of the compound , and a third - floor terrace had a 7 - foot privacy wall , they said			0
months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom - built to hide a high - value terrorism suspect , almost certainly @entity10			2
the officials noted there was no telephone or internet service at the dwelling , which was valued at more than $ 1 million , and its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did			0
calling the @entity2 operation a surgical raid , officials said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage			1
a firefight was under way for most of the 40 minutes that @entity2 special operations forces were in the compound , as the team encountered resistance from @entity10 and three other men , a senior defense official said			1
the official said the forces had to fight their way through the first floor of the three - story building , where two adult males lived			2
@entity10 and his family lived on the second and third floors , and they were cleared last , with @entity10 killed in the last five or 10 minutes of the siege , the official said			1
one of @entity10 's wives identified his body to @entity2 forces after the team made visual identification , the official said			1
in the end , all four of the combatants in the compound were dead , along with a woman whom one of the men used as a human shield , the officials said			2
sources said @entity10 was shot in the head			1
@entity141 , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said it is his understanding that the woman who was killed was one of @entity10 's wives			1
later , a senior @entity2 official said that @entity10 's wife was not the woman killed and that she may not have been used as a human shield after all			1
this official also said that @entity10 was shot twice , once in the chest and once in the head			1
at some point , one of the assaulting helicopters crashed due to a mechanical failure , according to the officials			0
it was destroyed as the @entity2 team flew away , they said			0
@entity19 and the senior administration officials said no @entity2 forces were harmed in the operation , which took place very early monday morning @entity5 time			2
@entity165 , a resident doctor in @entity49 , said she woke up to a large thundering sound			0
" my initial reaction was that maybe we 're being attacked ... i saw the last helicopter			0
it was flying very low			0
initially i was too afraid to get out			0
i was very terrified , " she said			0
@entity2 officials said they used a number of methods to identify the body as @entity10			2
one official said it was clear to the assault force that the body matched @entity10 's description , but they used " facial recognition work , amongst other things , to confirm the identity			1
" a senior national security official told @entity0 that they had multiple confirmations that the body was @entity10 , saying they had the " ability to run images of the body and the face			1
" another @entity2 official told @entity0 that @entity10 has already been buried at sea			1
his body was handled in the @entity196 tradition , said the official , who did not elaborate			2
a senior administration official also said @entity10 's body would be " handled in accordance with @entity196 practice and tradition			1
this is something that we take very seriously , and so therefore this is being handled in an appropriate manner			0
" according to the senior administration officials , intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that @entity10 might be located at the compound in @entity5			1
by mid-february , the intelligence was considered strong enough to begin considering action pledged by @entity19 when @entity10 's whereabouts had been determined			1
to discuss that intelligence and develop a plan , @entity19 chaired five @entity217 meetings from mid-march until late april , with the last two on april 19 and april 28 -- last thursday			0
the next day , on friday , @entity19 gave the order for the mission , the officials said			0
a @entity2 official said multiple options were considered before settling on the assault			2
" a bombing would not have risked @entity2 lives but it might have left questions " as to whether @entity10 was killed , the official said			1
national security officials widely agreed " the best option is the one that gives proof , " the official said			0
the key break involved one of the few couriers trusted by @entity10 , according to the officials			2
about two years ago , intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in @entity5 , and it took until august of last year to find the compound in @entity49 , they said			0
" when we saw the compound where the brothers lived , we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound , " one senior administration official said			2
" the compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built			0
it is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area			0
" noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property , intelligence analysts concluded the compound was " custom - built to hide someone of extraordinary significance , " the official said , adding : " everything was consistent with what experts thought @entity10 's compound would look like			1
" @entity2 forces also recovered what a senior intelligence official is calling " quite a bit of material			2
" " there 's a robust collection of materials we need to sift through , and we hope to find valuable intelligence that will lead us to other players in @entity16 , " the senior intelligence official said			1
a task force has been set up " because of the sheer volume of material collected			0
that material is currently being exploited and analyzed , " the official added			0
@entity0 's @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report			0
