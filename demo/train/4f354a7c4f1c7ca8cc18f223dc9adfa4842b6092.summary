-- @entity1 weekend has , over the years , turned in large part into something it was not originally intended to be : seventy - two hours of barbecues and ballgames , of swimming - pool openings , of high - decibel sales pitches by merchandisers hoping to cash in on the unofficial start of summer			1
which , to a degree , is understandable			0
the weather is turning warm , there 's a holiday feel to the break from work , and the solemnity and grieving for those who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace seems to sometimes get pushed aside			1
but it is that pursuit of peace , with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices , that remains the centerpiece of @entity1			1
and this weekend it might be worth pausing , if only for a moment , to reflect upon a quotation that has variously been attributed to @entity29 and to @entity30 : " we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm			1
" through history , peace in the world has often , of necessity , been attained by the most brutal means available during military conflict			2
there is a dichotomy intrinsic to wars waged in pursuit of peace -- an uneasy divide between lightness and shadows			1
@entity49 born of bloodshed ; happiness the end result of horror			2
we do n't like to think too much about that , and no wonder			0
the truth behind it goes against our better nature			0
what is the most beloved image celebrating the joyous end of @entity62 ? it 's the @entity64 photo of the sailor and the nurse embracing in @entity67			1
even now , more than 60 years later , that photo makes people weep with glad emotion , makes them grin with across - the - generations exultation			2
that photo , it is often declared , says it all			2
but there would be no photo of the sailor and the nurse were it not for scenes no one likes to see in photographs : the atomic bombing of @entity83 that brought the awful years of war to a close			1
it is perfectly explicable that we much prefer bathing ourselves in exuberant images of the first hours of peace , rather than the gruesome images of the last hours of war			1
one person who was in fact present during those last hours of @entity62 was @entity94			0
during the many days and evenings i spent with him during the final years of his life , there were occasions when the conversation would turn to that photo of the sailor and the nurse			2
sometimes , when we were traveling together and he would be attending a military reunion , someone would approach him with a copy of the photo			2
@entity94 would never say anything			0
he 'd look over at me and merely raise his eyebrows , almost imperceptibly			0
he was n't the photographer , but @entity64 would have had nothing to photograph were it not for him			0
he was the man -- the military aviator -- assigned by the @entity116 government to put together , in utter secrecy , the unit that would carry out the atomic raids on @entity120			0
when the day came , he did n't delegate ; he flew the @entity121 named @entity122 -- his mother 's name -- to @entity124 with one goal in mind : to make the war stop			1
to let the soldiers , sailors , aviators and @entity131 go home at last , to rejoin their families or start new families , to somehow , after all the suffering and all the heartbreak , find peace			2
of course the sailor and the nurse are the preferred visual representation of victory			0
what @entity94 , navigator @entity142 , bombardier @entity143 and their crew were asked to do over the skies of @entity120 is something that is difficult for many people to think about ; it 's much more pleasant to smile at the sight of the kiss in @entity153			1
peace is the sun - dappled result , but getting there can be a path of darkness upon darkness			0
which is why , on @entity1 weekend , it is probably reasonable that some people reflexively turn away from thoughts of battlefields and death			1
the people who turn away are generally not the ones whose family members have in wartime trod that dark and lonely path			0
on the occasions through the centuries when long wars have come to an end , many newspapers have chosen to go with the most glorious single - word , all - capital - letters headline of all : peace ! is there a word in the @entity182 language that is more welcome , more highly cherished ? that is more likely to be greeted with exhilaration and prayerful relief by all who see it ? nearly every desire a person , or a nation , can have is embodied in that single syllable			1
all the lightness and all the shadows , all the wars waged at terrible costs , all in pursuit of peace			0
to get to such a state of harmony has never been a peaceful journey			0
which is why the word is so beautiful , so yearned for : because it sounds so simple while remaining so rare			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : @entity1 a holiday for barbecues , *fun* ; but better to reflect on peace
he says day raises dichotomy : brutality , which we shun , to bring peace , which we embrace
his friend dropped @entity124 bomb from @entity122 . his purpose to end war , bring peace
@entity206 : we prefer to think of war 's end in famous @entity227 kiss photo
