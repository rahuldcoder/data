-- on the morning of april 29 , 22 million @entity1 tuned in to watch @entity2 marry prince @entity3			0
the following week , the couple was on the cover of dozens of magazines , with people still poring over every detail of their royal " i do 's			1
" but @entity2 's turn as a bridal cover girl would be short - lived			1
just three weeks later , reality star @entity12 landed herself on the front of @entity14 with a big ring ( with a 20.5 - carat diamond , for those keeping score ) and the big news that she was engaged to @entity21 player @entity20			1
and with that , the other wedding of the year was under way			0
not convinced the @entity12 hoopla rivals the royals ? according to several of the countless paparazzi hoping to get a shot of her wedding this saturday , a high - quality candid photograph of the bride in her wedding dress could sell for the same price as a 2012 @entity35			1
@entity12 , and her " @entity38 " co-stars / family members , will also have their own four - hour tv special -- yes , four hours -- to air on @entity41 in two parts , on october 9 and 10			1
" @entity12 is our people 's princess , " @entity44 's editor - in - chief @entity43 said			1
" people empathize with her			2
... she 's gone through relationship struggles , battles with her weight			2
things have n't always gone as planned			0
[ we 're happy ] to see her find her prince			0
" " weddings do incredibly well for magazines , " @entity43 said			0
" we 'll look at a stranger 's wedding photos and enjoy them and find them extremely irresistible			2
" but , @entity43 and other editors agree , the fact that it 's @entity12 's wedding is an added bonus on the newsstand			1
just look at @entity12 by the numbers : on sunday night , 3.2 million viewers tuned in to watch the latest episode of @entity41 's " keeping up with the @entity38			1
" and according to @entity70 , @entity12 's cover of @entity69 was the fitness magazine 's top seller for 2010			1
she was @entity75 's second - highest and @entity74 's third - highest - selling covers of the same year			2
@entity79 , a cover shot of @entity12 's wedding could be the holy grail of the weekly tabloid world , which is why @entity44 , @entity83 , ok ! and @entity14 all bid for rights to the exclusive story and photos , a source told @entity0			1
people magazine nabbed the exclusive rights to the wedding photographs for an unknown amount , though figures ranging between $ 300,000 and $ 1 million have been reported			1
" exclusive wedding photos can go for a lot of money , " said @entity92 , a writer for celebrity photo site @entity93			1
" it 's so rare to get an exclusive -- so rare it 's almost accidental			2
" when there 's an exclusive deal in place , as there often is with @entity12 happenings -- @entity106 's wedding , @entity108 's baby and now @entity12 's nuptials -- the photos are more valuable			1
but , @entity92 says , they 're also harder to get			0
" they 'll likely have tents [ set up ] -- everything will be covered , " she said			0
" you have to hope that event planners have left holes in walkways and that you happen to catch them at the right moment			0
it 's a huge challenge			2
i would n't be surprised if no one gets a shot			0
" @entity92 added that depending on its quality , a photo of @entity12 on her big day could sell for more than $ 50,000			1
if a magazine with an exclusive deal in place finds out that another photo agency has candid pictures , it might shell out big money to scoop them off the market , she added			2
" it 's bad business to let a competing magazine run a candid shot			0
" @entity139 , a sales manager at @entity140 , another photo news agency , says he 's not sure if they 're " going to go up in the air " in a helicopter to cover the wedding			1
" it will be a game - time decision , " he said , adding : " when push comes to shove , it 's just not really worth it to shoot a grainy picture from hundreds of feet overhead and hope that you 're circling the mansion ... when @entity12 and @entity20 are kissing			1
" @entity152 , the @entity153 bureau chief at @entity154 , said the agency will send a couple of photographers to cover the event , but they wo n't be in " commando guerrilla army mode			0
" " we 're sending a couple guys to get what they can , but we 're realistic in that we do n't feel it 's worth a huge outlay of money to try and bust that exclusive , " @entity152 said , adding that talk of sending helicopters and a tank to cover the affair is a running joke in the office			2
" it 's like a war			0
" despite the fact that there was an exclusive deal in place for @entity106 and @entity179 's september 2009 nuptials -- which about 3 million people tuned in to watch -- the wedding was really easy to shoot , @entity152 said			1
" they all but red carpeted that wedding , " she said			0
at one point , she added , the entire wedding party took pictures from the top of a hill , making it really easy to shoot			0
though , photographers agree , getting the perfect shot most likely wo n't be as easy this time around			0
" if it 's tented , we ca n't shoot from the air			2
they 'll probably cover them when they 're walking			0
it will be a big game , " @entity152 said			0
magazines that do n't want to spend the money [ on wedding photos ] will probably just use a shot of [ @entity12 ] in a white dress from the red carpet , " she added			1
" half the people wo n't know the difference			0

@entity12 's four - hour - long tv special will air on @entity41 in two parts on october 9 - 10
photographers : a high - quality photo of her in her dress could sell for more than $ 50,000
people nabbed the exclusive story and photos for an unknown amount
