when @entity2 forces toppled the @entity4 government following the 9/11 attacks , there was a global wave of support from people horrified by the plight of @entity11 women			1
under the @entity4 , women had been denied education , banned from medical treatment by male doctors , and publicly executed for " immorality			0
" the @entity4 's fall promised women some basic freedoms and rights			2
indeed , over the past 10 years there have been significant improvements for @entity11 women and girls			1
official restrictions ended on access to education , work , and health care			0
millions of girls went to school for the first time			0
women joined government , won elected office , and became police officers and even soldiers			0
a new constitution in 2004 guaranteed women equal rights , and a 2009 law made violence against women a crime			2
underneath the surface of these changes , however , deep seated problems persist			2
women in public life have suffered harassment , threats , and sometimes murder			2
forced marriage , underage marriage , and domestic violence are widespread and too widely accepted			1
about 400 women and girls are imprisoned at present for the " moral crimes " of sex outside of marriage and simply running away from home , often to flee abuse			0
while education is more accessible , more than half of girls still do n't go to school			0
every two hours an @entity11 woman dies of pregnancy - related causes			0
as the announced departure of international forces in 2014 draws closer , many @entity11 women look to the future with fear			1
they worry that the troop pullout signals the end of interest in @entity11 , and with it the international commitment to push the @entity11 government to promote and protect women 's rights			1
also likely to decrease is the foreign aid that pays for schools and clinics that have changed many lives			0
@entity11 women fear being abandoned again by the rest of the world , as they were during the @entity4 era			1
plans for peace negotiations between the @entity4 and the @entity11 government raise the specter of women 's rights being bargained away			1
if there are no women at the negotiating table , this is even more likely			0
this week the fragility of women 's rights in @entity11 has been on full display			1
the @entity101 , a government - supported body of religious leaders , issued a statement on several issues , including the recent burning of copies of the @entity109 at a @entity2 military base			1
the longest part of the statement , however , gave religious guidance on how women should be treated and should behave			2
the statement said some good things			0
it prohibited a traditional practice of giving a girl to another family to resolve a dispute ( " baad " )			0
it spoke against forced marriage			2
it confirmed women 's rights to inherit and own property			1
on women 's duties , however , the statement took a turn for the worse : women should not travel without a male chaperone			1
women should not mix with men while studying , or working , or in public			2
women must wear the @entity138 hijab			0
women are secondary to men			0
if this was just the view of conservative religious leaders , it would be discouraging , but just another in a long line of discriminatory statements about women from @entity11 's male dominated institutions			1
what caused consternation , however , was the sense that president @entity153 had embraced the statement			0
in a departure from usual practice , the statement was posted on the @entity159 website , distributed to the media by the @entity161 , and defended by president @entity153 at a news conference			0
president @entity153 has a mixed record on women 's rights			1
he committed @entity11 to an international convention promising equal rights for women and pushed through by decree the 2009 law making violence against women a crime			1
he recently spoke out on two high - profile cases of violence against women			0
on the other hand , in the run - up to the 2009 presidential election he curried favor with hard - liners by signing the @entity181 , which , for @entity11 's @entity181 minority , gives a husband the right to withdraw maintenance from his wife , including food , if she refuses to obey sexual demands , grants guardianship of children exclusively to men , and requires women to have permission from their husbands to work			2
some women fear that @entity153 is using the @entity101 statement to send a message about what compromises he is ready to make with the @entity4			0
with international interest in @entity11 waning , negotiations with the @entity4 in the offing , and @entity153 's endorsement of the @entity101 's statement , @entity11 women are more vulnerable than at any time in the past 10 years			1
now president @entity205 and other backers of the @entity11 government should make it clear that they will not support any deals that sacrifice women 's rights , and press @entity153 to make his position clear			1
the risks for @entity11 women are too high to do anything less .			2

@entity11 women 's rights have improved in the last 10 years but problems persist
harassment , forced marriage and domestic violence are still widespread
religious leaders issued a statement this week on how women should behave
they said that women should n't travel without a male chaperone or mix with men in public
