editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- " you know , it 's weird , man			1
it 's like everybody 's real cordial with each other			2
but , at the end of the day , we 're , like , buying weapons to destroy each other			1
i do n't want to , like , sound too liberal or anything			2
but it 's really not glamorous			2
this s * * * f * * * * * kills people			0
" shockingly , the guy who said this was n't some antiwar hippie who had just dropped acid			0
he was a 6 ' 4 " @entity39 sergeant who had recently returned from two tours in @entity42			0
we were both attendees at the 2010 @entity44 ( @entity44 ) in @entity45			1
his reaction was prompted by the trade - show floor -- a sea of displays and kiosks from weapons companies hawking missiles , machine guns , tanks , and bombs like they were next year 's luxury sedans			1
even more unsettling , the biggest dealers were from the @entity58 when i was a young punk kid , it was fashionable to say things like , " the military - industrial complex is taking over the world			0
" at the time , i did n't know what " military - industrial complex " meant , but the conference rapidly provided me with a very literal definition of the term			0
@entity44 takes place every two years in @entity70 , and is largely the brainchild of @entity45 's @entity72 , who has a penchant for special operations and massive displays of artillery			1
over the course of a week , more than 12,000 attendees tromped through massive tents housing hundreds of arms manufacturers			1
the atmosphere was insidious but open , an organized free - for - all in which @entity58 companies like @entity83 , @entity84 , and @entity85 sold weapons to almost any nation that could afford them			1
see the rest of @entity44 : the @entity91 at @entity5 i 've been to hundreds of depressing media trade shows , and @entity44 's salespeople are no different from the rest , except that their wares are designed to destroy things and kill people			1
i witnessed representatives from almost every nation spending millions of dollars on heavy munitions			0
i was wondering if the transactions were padded by foreign aid from the @entity58 and other countries			0
i heard high - ranking soldiers say things like , " when i retire i 'm going to be on the other side of the table -- ha ha ha ha			0
" what this means is that it 's not uncommon for generals with government - controlled salaries around $ 100,000 a year to spend the twilight of their careers purchasing billions worth of munitions from arms companies who , in turn , offer these same senior officers state - side " consulting " gigs with multimillion - dollar salaries			1
it 's blatant payola , the whole thing so corrupt it borders on absurd			0
@entity131 , as it turned out , was a running theme of the conference .			0

@entity5 goes inside a huge *biennial* weapons *convention* in @entity70 , @entity45
over a week , 12,000 attendees peruse tents housing hundreds of arms manufacturers
missiles , machine guns , tanks , and bombs are among the wares for sale
