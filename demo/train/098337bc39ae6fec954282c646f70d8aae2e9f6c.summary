like many , she wants to be buried in a cemetery with her loved ones			2
her loved ones just happen to be her four cats and one dog			0
@entity8 , 65 , never thought she would be able to be buried in a pet cemetery but a new regulation enacted by the @entity12 @entity11 officially permits pet cemeteries to inter the cremated remains , or " cremains , " of pet owners along with their pets			1
" a sizable segment of the @entity12 community articulated a desire to be able to have their cremains buried with their pet remains , " stated the formal " notice of adoption " published in the official @entity26 register wednesday			1
" no evidence suggests that permitting this practice will harm cemeteries for human remains			1
" under the regulation , effective august 2 , pet cemeteries can accept human cremains for burial but can not charge a separate fee for those remains or advertise their human - remains burial services			1
the state set those rules to make it clear pet cemeteries were not engaging in " the operation of a cemetery for human remains			1
" @entity12 is one of a handful of states that has made formal regulations regarding human remains in pet cemeteries			1
" most states have not addressed this specifically			0
it 's very much a state of flux right now , " said @entity52 , an attorney and funeral director based in @entity54 , @entity55			0

the pet cemetery , established in 1896 , had been allowing human - remains interment for decades			1
" our records indicate it was being done since early 1920s , " @entity78 , the cemetery 's director , said of the practice			2
" we were doing it all along			0
a couple of years ago , the @entity12 [ state ] @entity85 asked us to cease the procedure to take a closer look			0
" eventually the state decided in favor of people who wanted to rest eternally with their mascots			2
and it was the growing demand of owners wanting to be buried with their pets that sparked government attention , said @entity52			1
" it 's been going on for so many years and no one has ever said anything , " said @entity52			0
" it 's going to happen , so why not allow it to happen and regulate it			0
it 's just a matter of time before states start regulating this more and more			0
" the decision covers all pet cemeteries in @entity26			1
