-- as the nation faces a looming retirement crisis , a member of @entity4 has proposed a terrible idea that would bash seniors			1
@entity8 rep. @entity7 of @entity9 asked the @entity10 to consider raising the price of the senior lifetime pass to help solve the parks ' $ 153 million budget gap caused by the sequester cuts			1
pause for a moment and consider that $ 153 million is a tiny portion of the federal budget			0
it is a little more than the value of @entity22 ' house and a fraction of the price of a b - 2 bomber			2
people over 62 can buy a $ 10 lifetime pass to the more than 2000 federal recreational sites			1
for volunteers , the disabled and young children , it 's free			1
with the exception of a few other cases , it 's $ 80 for an annual pass to all the sites			1
if the park service doubled the cost of the senior lifetime pass , it would raise $ 5 million			1
that 's such a tiny drop in the bucket it 's laughable			2
this is not about the $ 5 million			0
raising the lifetime park pass for seniors is not offered up to lower park admission prices for young people			1
in other words , there is no fixed pie			1
if grandma gets more , then baby @entity52 gets less			0
no. unlike reptiles , human societies do not arrange to eat their young			0
there is a sincere but mistaken belief out there that the old are taking advantage of the young			0
societies that pay for the old can pay for the young , too			0
it 's not a zero - sum game			0
my colleagues and i have analyzed the national budgets in more than 63 nations			0
when a society spends more money on the elderly , they also spend more money on education and other programs benefiting the young			1
for example , in the @entity77 in the 1970s , education spending tripled , education attainment rates soared and @entity80 and @entity81 expanded			1
the park pass proposal comes across as another attempt to erode the financial situation of @entity77 seniors who are already facing threats in their coming old age			1
the various proposals floating around to cut @entity80 are scary enough for older @entity77			1
for example , one idea from the @entity90 is to raise the age seniors can collect their full @entity80 benefits from 67 to 70 and the eligibility age from 62 to 65			2
president @entity95 has proposed replacing the regular consumer price index , or @entity97 , to adjust @entity80 benefits with the chained @entity97 -- often called the cat food @entity97 because the index assumes that when the price of human food rises , seniors can substitute cheaper food to get the same nutrition			2
a chained @entity97 would lower lifetime benefits to the oldest seniors by more than $ 25,000			2
with the @entity77 economy growing at a sluggish pace , older @entity77 who are nearing retirement face more uncertainty			2
in 2012 , a report from the @entity113 found employers are reluctant to hire older workers , citing reasons such as outdated skills as one of the factors			0
workers who are 55 years old and up who lose their jobs have it the hardest			0
they face the longest period of unemployment			0
members of @entity4 who want generational fairness and balanced budgets wo n't get there by whacking the elderly with @entity80 cuts or higher park pass prices			1
why ca n't @entity4 be smarter about finding ways to revitalize the economy and create jobs ? that is a rhetorical question			0
they are busy finding coins in the sofa cushions instead of creating a sustainable and stabilizing federal budget			0
raising the price of park passes for the elderly wo n't make a real dent or help young people enjoy the trees more			1
with this budget process , fewer and fewer families or the elderly will be able to get to the park if they 're busy scrambling to get by			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			2

a *congresswoman* proposes raising the price of the senior lifetime pass to national parks
@entity155 : raising the price for the elderly wo n't make a real dent
she says the idea seems like another attempt to erode the financial situation of @entity77 seniors
@entity155 : there is no fixed pie ; it 's not as if seniors get more , then young people get less
