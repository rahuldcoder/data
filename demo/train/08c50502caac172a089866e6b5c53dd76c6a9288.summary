-- while many changes to @entity3 ' health care outlined in the the @entity6 do n't take effect until 2014 , a @entity5 ruling expected this month could stop those changes from coming at all			1
the act , often referred to as " @entity6 , " is a step toward guaranteeing insurance coverage for all @entity3 and received enough support to pass in @entity13 in 2010			1
however , the @entity5 agreed to hear arguments on several of its core issues in march			1
the court may rule on the issues by the end of this month			1
basics : health care reform issues no matter the ruling , most @entity3 will be affected			1
here are some of the issues being discussed right now : business owners one hundred and sixty million @entity3 receive health care from their employers , many of whom set their own rates for their employees			1
if the court rules against the act , employees might face higher premiums , fewer network providers , higher - deductible plans and more stringent regulations on adding adult dependents			0
what is @entity42 's @entity41 to safeguard employees and industry if the act is struck down ? here are some insights : employers ' ' plan b ' if health reform is axed employers bear brunt of health insurance hikes small business owners if you run your own company , the act has a lot of good in store for you -- that is , if you know how to access it			2
many small business owners across the country who do offer health coverage have n't taken advantage of , or did n't even know about , a tax credit that helps offset giving employees insurance			2
why would n't small business owners take advantage of this ? @entity72 answers that question and talks about what might happen if only parts of the act are kept : the health care tax credit few are taking what 's at stake for small businesses national spending being insured helps safeguard against pricey medical bills			0
however , a report released tuesday from the @entity84 suggests that the act wo n't limit national health spending			0
in fact , it predicts that spending will skyrocket after a brief recession - induced dip			0
growth in health spending does n't necessarily correlate with growth in health care costs , but what does it mean ? here 's a projection : health spending growth to stay low , then jump @entity3 's youth for today 's young adults , health care comes last			1
if you ca n't afford to feed and clothe yourself , why budget for something that has n't happened yet ? however , youth get sick too , and their future bank accounts might take a toll if the act is repealed -- or if they do n't insure themselves , period			0
additionally , the ones who do insure themselves tend to forgo expenditures elsewhere ( like graduate school ) to make ends meet			0
young adults skip health care as medical debts rise for 20 - somethings , health care hangs in the balance senior citizens health reform has been the belle of the senior citizen community , saving @entity126 beneficiaries a collective $ 3.7 billion dollars on their medication costs since its inception in 2010			0
one of the reform 's aims is to close the " donut hole , " or portion of senior citizens that ca n't pay for medication out of pocket , by 2020			0
read how @entity126 has been affected by health care reform : @entity126 : seniors saved $ 3.7 billion on medicine doctors at risk increases in insurance coverage and changes in @entity126 help patients avoid footing hefty medical bills , but sometimes their doctors pay the price			1
read why some doctors , especially those in private practice , are running out of money : doctors going broke doctors : we could go out of business silver linings just because a negative ruling would give health insurers and states the ability to opt out of reform - era options does n't mean they 're going to			2
@entity164 , the nation 's largest health insurer , said that while it will take cues from competitors , it will maintain some of the act 's key mandates regardless of the court 's decision			0
moreover , there is strong bipartisan support for state - created health care exchange programs , many of which have been set into motion , where those seeking insurance can look for subsidized coverage			0
@entity164 to keep some health care mandates exchanges could survive even if health reform law dies the fine print very few people take the time to read bills in their entirety , but should we ? @entity0 investigates lesser - known changes to the health care system tucked into " @entity6			1
" check out these tidbits : 10 lesser - known effects of health care reform law			2
