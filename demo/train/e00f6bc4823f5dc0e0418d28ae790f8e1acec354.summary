several times in recent months , @entity0 has been treated to a spectacle that @entity4 grew accustomed to -- and sick of -- a long time ago : an outburst from ex-mayor @entity6 that is equal parts ugly , thoughtless and divisive			1
" i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity0 , " went the latest outburst , delivered to a group of fellow @entity10 at a @entity12 restaurant			1
@entity17 , said @entity6 , " does n't love you			1
and he does n't love me			0
he was n't brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country			0
" the @entity21 barely even acknowledged the outburst , in part because @entity6 , a failed candidate for president , has become more of a cable television rabble - rouser than a serious national political figure			1
consider what happened in 2008 , when @entity6 and @entity17 were both on the ballot for the highest office in the land			2
@entity17 went on to become president ; @entity6 , by contrast spent nearly $ 50 million and lost every caucus and primary he entered before dropping out with a grand total of only one delegate , a modern record for electoral futility			1
in other words , it would be more accurate to say @entity0 -- as expressed by the will of the voting public -- does n't love @entity6			1
but that wo n't stop him from sounding off again in the future			0
last november , on " @entity53 , " @entity6 waded into the racial tensions that racked @entity46 , @entity47 , by blaming the police killing of unarmed black teenager @entity50 on black communities -- all black communities			2
in a stunning exchange with author and scholar @entity56 -- one of many advocates complaining about the use of excessive police force -- @entity6 said : " the white police officers would n't be there if you were n't killing each other 70 to 75 % of the time			2
" exactly who he meant by " you " was n't explained ; it did n't have to be			0
@entity6 's favorite political math equation is long division : separate the public into " us " and " them " ( e.g. , " he does n't love you			1
and he does n't love me " ) and then pose as champion of half the people			0
and if there are racial overtones to the divisiveness , so be it			0
" why do n't you cut it [ street violence ] down so many white police officers wo n't have to be in black areas ? " he said to @entity56 , an academic and author who has no power or responsibility to end violence anywhere , but happens to be black			0
after a national furor , @entity6 slightly backed away from his outburst about @entity17 , grudgingly acknowledging that the twice - elected @entity87 is , indeed a " patriot			1
" we live in a country that survey researches say is more divided by party and ideology than at any time in decades			0
to understand why we continue to talk past one another , look no further than the @entity95 of @entity0 , who eagerly feed on fear and anger instead of developing a positive vision for the country .			2
