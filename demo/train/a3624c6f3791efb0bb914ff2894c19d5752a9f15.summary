when first revealed , @entity1 's account of his life as a double agent inside @entity5 sent shockwaves through @entity8 's political and intelligence establishment			1
the first accounts came in the @entity8 newspaper @entity10 in october 2012			2
in those articles , and in his new memoir " @entity11 : my @entity20 and the @entity17 , " which we co-authored , @entity1 recounted how after being recruited by @entity8 intelligence agency @entity15 , he helped the @entity17 target several @entity5 terrorists for assassination , most notably the @entity24 terrorist cleric @entity23 , who was killed in a @entity17 drone strike in september 2011			1
the allegations have proven explosive in @entity8 , where it is illegal for the government to take part in targeted killings			2
storm says his @entity8 handlers set up and attended meetings he had with the @entity17 in @entity8 and overseas at which plans to track down terrorists were set in motion			1
he says @entity8 intelligence was fully aware the @entity24 planned to use lethal force			2
storm has significant corroborating evidence to back up his claim			0
he provided us with several hours of secret @entity46 recordings of meetings and phone calls with his @entity8 and @entity24 intelligence handlers during which several of the kill missions were discussed			2
@entity53 has not been able to independently authenticate the recordings , but the time the electronic files were first created were consistent with his account			0
one of the recordings was of a meeting he says was set up with his @entity15 and @entity17 handlers at a @entity8 resort a week after @entity62 was killed			1
on the tape , @entity1 makes clear to an @entity24 interlocutor that he and @entity8 intelligence had been key to getting @entity62 : " we took initiative to create this because the @entity24 failed in their attempt to hit @entity23 , they failed in their attempts to trace @entity72 , the @entity24 have failed in every single attempt to arrest or kill @entity72 , except when we went in , we traced him down again , created contacts with him , now he is dead , because of the work we have done			1
" agent claims he had been promised $ 5 million in the same recording , the @entity24 can be heard telling storm that president @entity80 knew about his contribution to the @entity83 mission , " we had our whole project going forward -- of which you played the highest role , ' he said			1
but the @entity24 denied @entity1 provided the critical breakthrough , frustrating storm , who told @entity53 he had been promised $ 5 million if he led the @entity17 to the terrorist cleric			2
it was after this meeting he first made contact with the @entity8 newspaper			2
after @entity10 first broke the story , @entity15 refused to confirm or deny @entity1 's claims			1
" out of consideration for @entity15 's operational work , the pet neither can nor will confirm publicly that specific persons have been used as sources by the @entity15 , " it said			1
" however , the @entity15 does not participate in or support operations where the objective is to kill civilians			2
the pet did therefore not contribute to the military operation that led to the killing of @entity62 in @entity106 , " then - @entity15 director @entity107 stated			1
neither @entity15 nor the @entity17 responded to @entity53 's requests for further comment			1
storm 's revelations led @entity8 parliamentarians to demand new oversight rules for @entity15			1
in january 2013 , @entity114 met with several of them in @entity116			0
@entity8 's @entity117 announced it would set up a supervisory board to oversee the @entity8 intelligence agency , without acknowledging @entity1 was the reason			1
then - justice minister @entity121 said the new board would strike " the right balance that will ensure that we have an effective intelligence agency and a good rule of law			0
" but the government resisted calls from opposition mp 's for a full parliamentary inquiry			0
after the publication of another @entity133 - @entity10 article in march 2013 , with fresh evidence retrieved from @entity1 's cell phones , @entity1 's account received heavyweight backing from @entity8 's former spy chief			2
@entity139 , @entity107 's predecessor as head of @entity15 , told @entity8 television that the corroborating evidence presented in the @entity8 media suggested the @entity15 had used storm to track down terrorist operatives overseas to help the @entity24 target them for assassination			1
@entity147 was at the helm of the intelligence agency in the period before @entity1 says he was recruited as an agent			1
in late 2013 , a political scandal forced the resignations of @entity154 and interior minister @entity121 after it emerged @entity107 had instructed subordinates to obtain information on the movements of a @entity8 mp			0
reforms may be coming in @entity8 the revelations put @entity1 's story back in the public spotlight			0
@entity139 sharpened his criticism of @entity15 , asserting the disclosures on @entity8 involvement in assassination plans overseas were so serious there was a basis for a criminal investigation			1
at the end of the year the beleaguered agency was put under more pressure when @entity10 disclosed @entity15 's refusal to offer storm protection after @entity174 linked militants in @entity176 threatened his life in a video			1
" is it really a satisfactory way for the security services to carry out their task in that it takes three weeks before you answer a former employee who -- rightly -- felt threatened by @entity186 ? ' the chairman of the @entity185 told the newspaper			0
storm now lives in hiding in an undisclosed location in the @entity190 , and says he currently receives no protection from any @entity194 intelligence service			0
in april 2014 , the pressure on @entity8 increased further when the @entity196 , a @entity197 based legal advocacy group , called on @entity8 to acknowledge its role in @entity62 's killing and announced it had filed freedom of information requests with the @entity8 government regarding storm			0
" @entity8 officials have refused to respond specifically and meaningfully to numerous questions posed on this subject by the legal affairs committee of @entity8 's parliament , " a press release by the group stated			0
" the evidence that has been revealed by @entity10 , is very worrying			0
they show that @entity15 actively cooperated with the @entity17 in the operation to track down and kill @entity72			1
they show that @entity15 was eager to cover up his role in the program			0
they show that @entity15 was trying to hide the truth from the @entity8 public			1
the evidence suggests that @entity15 may have violated the @entity223 provisions relating to murder and international legal prohibitions on , among others , the right to life , among other laws			0
these are very serious offenses , " @entity230 , the senior legal officer for national security and counterterrorism for the @entity196 , told @entity10			0
@entity147 told @entity53 new oversight rules for @entity15 are now being discussed which would require the agency to submit an annual report to a parliamentary oversight committee on how many agents it was running and how they were being run			2
@entity240 , one of @entity242 's leading counterterrorism academics , told @entity249 's revelations had " opened a @entity243 of ethical problems which will probably lead in the future to @entity15 's ability or leeway to act being restricted			0
" it is rare indeed for an intelligence informant to go public about his work			0
in @entity1 's case the disclosures may change the law -- and radically change the way his former employer works			0
excerpt from ' @entity114 ' : finding a wife for @entity72			0

he claims @entity8 agency recruited him to work with @entity17
@entity15 said it had nothing to do with @entity72 operation
