-- president @entity1 promised accountability , but he made clear wednesday he wo n't fire @entity4 secretary @entity3 -- yet -- over excessive and sometimes deadly waiting times faced by veterans seeking government health care			1
the controversy has mushroomed since @entity0 first reported the problem last november in a detailed investigation examining several @entity13 hospitals			1
hospital delays are killing war veterans after meeting with @entity3 at the @entity16 , @entity1 held a hastily arranged news conference in which he said he needed more time to review what was going on			1
" if these allegations prove to be true , it is dishonorable , it is disgraceful , and i will not tolerate it , period , " the president said in his first public comments in weeks on the issue			0
however , he made clear his main target for now was anyone who actually carried out improper practices at @entity13 , rather than the retired army general at the top			2
" anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at @entity13 facilities has to be held accountable , " @entity1 said			1
emotional issue the @entity13 problems touch on an emotional topic -- caring for @entity38 's military veterans , many of whom served in war -- and the revelations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide months - long waits for care prompted criticism of @entity3 and the @entity13 on both sides of the aisle			1
" my attitude is , for folks who have been fighting on the battlefield , they should not have to fight a bureaucracy at home to get the care that they 've earned , " @entity1 said			2
asked if @entity3 offered to resign , he said the retired army general " cares deeply about veterans and he cares deeply about the mission , and i know that @entity61 's attitude is if he does n't think he can do a good job on this and if he thinks he 's let our veterans down , then i 'm sure that he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve			2
" his remarks did little to soothe critics , with @entity16 @entity69 leader @entity69 of @entity70 quickly asserting that the president " is known for talking about accountability without ever holding anyone accountable			1
" rep. @entity74 of @entity75 became the first congressional @entity76 to publicly call for @entity3 's dismissal since the controversy erupted after @entity0 's initial reporting			2
@entity86 released a statement after @entity1 's remarks that said : " while i do n't think a change in leadership will immediately solve the serious problems that plague the @entity13 , i do think it 's time to give someone else an opportunity to lead the agency and begin the rebuilding process to ensure these issues never happen again			1
" calls for @entity3 's dismissal the @entity93 , a major veterans ' group that has called for @entity3 's ouster , labeled @entity1 's decision to keep him in office " unfortunate			1
" " words are nice , and even somewhat comforting , but when will the @entity13 's house be cleansed of those who are soiling it and dishonoring the system ? " said @entity98 , the legion 's national commander			2
@entity1 noted that the public wants a " swift reckoning " on the @entity13 issue , but he defended the record of his administration and @entity3 -- who has been the only @entity111 secretary of his presidency			1
in particular , the president cited increased spending for @entity13 , expanded services , efforts to help veterans go to college and get jobs , and reducing a backlog of benefits claims			1
@entity0 reported last month that in @entity123 , the department used fraudulent record - keeping -- including secret lists -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans , some of whom died in the process			0
bonuses paid in a new development , @entity3 has rescinded an $ 8,495 bonus awarded to @entity123 va director @entity134 last month			1
@entity134 is on administrative leave in response to the allegations of misconduct under her watch			0
" @entity141 today exercised his authority to rescind @entity134 's fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately , " a @entity13 statement said on wednesday			1
" previously , ms. @entity134 received the performance award due to an administrative error			0
" meanwhile , the number of @entity13 facilities under investigation has expanded to 26 , the agency 's @entity146 said tuesday			1
last week , the inspector general told a @entity153 committee that 10 facilities were being investigated			0
@entity1 's deputy chief of staff , @entity155 , will head to @entity123 on wednesday night to interview the @entity13 office 's interim director and visit the facility			1
@entity155 is aiding @entity3 with a review of the allegations , and @entity1 said he expects a preliminary report from them next week			1
in addition , @entity155 is conducting a broader review of overall @entity13 health care administration , with a deadline to report back to @entity1 in a month , the president said			1
for six months , @entity0 has been reporting on delays in medical appointments for veterans across the country , with some dying or suffering harm while waiting for appointments and care			0
the most disturbing and striking problems emerged in @entity176 last month , with sources revealing to @entity0 details of a secret waiting list			0
according to the sources , at least 40 @entity38 veterans died in @entity123 while waiting for care at the va there			0
an internal @entity13 memo from 2010 , first disclosed at a congressional hearing last week , showed officials warned of " inappropriate scheduling practices " to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago			1
problem cited in 2010 the memo by @entity190 , who was a @entity13 deputy undersecretary , referred to a growing practice of " gaming strategies " that he said would not be tolerated			2
however , the @entity0 investigation shows such practices have continued			0
one of @entity0 's sources , dr. @entity197 , a retired @entity198 physician , said wednesday that @entity13 managers worried about being able to report they were meeting deadlines for providing care to veterans , rather than getting accurate information on what was happening			1
if the numbers provided to superiors looked good , then the @entity13 looked good , @entity197 explained , adding , " there 's really no incentive for the upper management to get accurate numbers			2
" he said , " i think the @entity13 needs to get out of its delay and deny mode and start admitting that there really is a problem , and that 's generally the first step in solving a problem is admitting you have one			2
" the @entity13 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to excessive waits by veterans for care , and the @entity13 inspector general launched an independent investigation of the @entity123 allegations and other va problems in addition to the internal review by @entity3 and @entity155			1
at a @entity153 hearing last week , the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in @entity123 but added there was no evidence that the excessive waiting caused those deaths			0
more details @entity1 sought to provide a more detailed description of the allegations on wednesday , saying the cooked books and excessive waits applied more to veterans with chronic conditions who are among the 85 million va appointments each year instead of those needing emergency care			2
at the same time , he wondered if a 14 - day deadline for the @entity13 to provide service to newly registered veterans -- a policy implemented under @entity3 -- was realistic			1
" what is not yet clear to me is whether enough tools were given to make sure those goals were actually met , " @entity1 said			2
" i wo n't know until the full report is put forward as to whether there was enough management follow up			0
" on monday , @entity16 spokesman @entity258 acknowledged the @entity16 learned of the situation at the @entity13 from @entity0 reports in april			1
asked tuesday about the 2010 memo by @entity190 , @entity258 refused to answer and instead referred reporters to the @entity13 because it was an internal agency document			0
the administration 's response so far has included putting three @entity13 officials on administrative leave ; recently accepting the resignation of @entity270 @entity269 shortly before he planned to retire this year ; appointing @entity271 to review @entity13 operations , and the inspector general 's independent investigation			1
since the initial @entity0 report , whistleblowers from other @entity13 hospitals have stepped forward to describe similar schemes by officials to hide the extended waits			2
the chairman of the @entity282 , @entity283 rep. @entity281 of @entity284 , called wednesday for @entity1 to take executive action to get waiting veterans the help they need			0
@entity281 also has threatened to propose a contempt motion against the @entity13 for what he calls its failure to adequately respond to his panel 's may 8 subpoena , which included a request for information about the alleged destruction of the secret wait list in @entity123			2
officials have denied any knowledge of it			0
he called three senior @entity13 officials to a committee business meeting on thursday to discuss the matter			1
the @entity13 said earlier this week that it was complying with the request for information			0
@entity1 said at his news conference that he wanted @entity3 and the @entity13 to act now to provide care for veterans who have been waiting			1
separately , the @entity16 overwhelmingly approved legislation proposed by @entity281 on wednesday that would make it easier to fire or demote senior executives at @entity4			0
the bill would give the @entity13 secretary the authority to remove at any time any of the agency 's senior executives based on performance			0
currently , executives get at least 30 days ' notice of a potential firing and the option of an appeal			0
companion legislation has been introduced in the @entity153 , but its prospects are not clear			0
@entity284 problems meanwhile , an audit team sent to the @entity324 in @entity325 , @entity284 , discovered a list of patients needing follow - up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the @entity13 's electronic computer system			0
as a result , three members of the @entity335 's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave , pending the outcome of the inspector general 's investigation , @entity332 spokeswoman @entity331 said this week			0
the secret waiting list in @entity123 was part of an elaborate scheme designed by @entity13 managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor , according to a recently retired top @entity13 doctor and several high - level sources			0
@entity13 officials denied any knowledge of a secret list , and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times			2
they acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there , but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died			0
@entity0 has tried repeatedly to interview @entity3 , but the requests have been denied			0
rights group calls @entity13 ' scapegoat ' in scandal over wait times , care @entity0 's @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity371 in @entity372 .			0
