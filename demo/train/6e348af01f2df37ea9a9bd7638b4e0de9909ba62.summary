@entity1 , @entity0 -- anyone expecting outspoken rocker @entity4 to spend his keynote address here at the @entity7 music conference talking about his new no. 1 album or the politically divided state of the country may have gotten a surprise			1
instead , @entity4 delivered a rousing , witty and personal history of his varied music influences -- from @entity14 to @entity15 to @entity16 to @entity17 -- punctuating his points by playing snippets of songs on a guitar			1
he also offered a little veteran advice for the thousands of young , unknown musicians who have descended upon @entity1 in the hopes of making it big			2
stay alive , " he said in his familiar rasp			2
" and when you walk onstage tonight to bring the noise , treat it like it 's all you have			2
" @entity4 is at @entity7 to help launch " @entity33 , " his 17th studio album , which voices his frustrations over what he sees as a lack of accountability by government and financial leaders for the country 's economic woes			1
several members of his @entity44 were in the audience , and he and the band were scheduled to perform at a 2,000 - seat theater thursday night in @entity1 before kicking off a @entity49 arena tour sunday in @entity50			2
thursday afternoon 's event placed the current @entity53 cover boy in an unusual setting : behind a podium in a packed convention hall -- and in the middle of the day , no less			2
looking a little bleary - eyed , @entity4 took the stage 30 minutes late , carrying his notes on sheafs of paper , and immediately complained about the time			1
" how important can this speech be if we 're giving it at noon ? " he asked			2
" every decent musician in town is asleep			0
or they will be when i 'm done with this thing			0
" @entity4 began his talk by marveling at the thousands of bands , in almost every musical genre , who are playing @entity1 this week and how that would have been inconceivable to him as a young music fan			1
he then pointed out how fractured the music landscape has become and how hard it is for consumers with divergent tastes to gain critical consensus around an artist -- including himself			1
in what may have been an allusion to today 's manufactured pop stars , he argued that what matters most in music is " purity of human expression , " not looks or labels or digital format			2
" we live in a post-authentic world			0
today authenticity is a house of mirrors , " he said in his hourlong talk			0
" it 's about what you 're bringing [ onstage ] when the lights go down			0
" @entity4 then began recounting his personal journey through music , beginning when he first saw @entity14 on " the @entity102 " at age 6			1
he managed to get his hands on a rented guitar , but his hands were too small to play it , so he just struck rock poses in front of the mirror			0
" i still do that , " he said with a chuckle			0
as a teenager , he recalled gazing in wonder at the @entity116 ' first record in a five - and - dime store			0
but the ' 60s band that made the biggest impression on him was @entity120 , whose gritty rebelliousness spoke to him deeply			0
to make his point , @entity4 strummed a few verses from " @entity129 , " with its chorus , " we got ta get out of this place / , ' cause girl , there 's a better life / for me and you ... " " that 's every song i 've ever written , " he said			1
" that 's all of them			0
" to show how @entity120 ' songs shaped his own , he strummed a few chords from " @entity139 , " before segueing into " @entity137 " and its similar structure			0
" listen up youngsters ! " he said to laughs from the crowd			0
" this is how successful theft is accomplished			0
" when it came to songwriting , @entity4 acknowledged he owes a huge debt to @entity15 , whose lyrics gave voice to the turbulent ' 60s and who he called " the father of my musical country , now and forever			1
" when @entity4 became famous in the mid- 1970s , he and fellow singer - songwriters such as @entity153 were given the dreaded " new @entity15 " label			1
" the old @entity15 was only 30 , " he said			1
" i do n't know why they f * * * ing needed a new @entity15			1
" @entity4 went on to cite his love of ' 60s and ' 70s soul singers such as @entity16 and @entity159 , who played " music of gritty determination , of the blues , of the earth			1
" he also drew inspiration from the lonesome - blues songs of country icon @entity17 , which he said reduced him to tears			1
" country music was provincial			2
and so was i , " he said			0
" i was not a bohemian , or a hipster			0
i was an average guy with maybe an above - average gift			0
" in his twenties @entity4 said he read a biography of folk singer @entity174 , whose @entity49 protest songs " spoke to me very deeply			1
" as if to prove it , he picked up his guitar again and led the @entity7 audience in a few choruses of " @entity180 " before leaving the stage .			1
