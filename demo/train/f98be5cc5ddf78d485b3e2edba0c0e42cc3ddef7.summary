-- " waiting for @entity8 , " the new novel from acclaimed @entity2 author @entity1 , is an evocative mix of sex , spies and psychoanalysis			1
the story opens in @entity10 in 1913			1
@entity12 actor @entity11 is seeking treatment from a psychoanalyst for an odd sexual ailment			0
while in the @entity17 capital he begins a passionate affair with another patient and it seems @entity11 is cured			0
when the secret tryst takes a dark turn , @entity11 is forced to escape @entity10 with help from the @entity2 consulate			1
he 's not long in @entity24 when war breaks out and @entity11 enlists in the army			1
soon after , he 's approached by the men who helped him escape @entity17 with a proposition he is in no position to refuse			2
morphing from actor to patient to soldier to spy , @entity11 is plunged into the dangerous world of wartime intelligence as a covert operative			0
fans of the author will love and recognize all the hallmarks of @entity1 's best books : a historical thriller , rife with espionage , set in the not - too - distant past , featuring an exotic and exquisitely drawn locale and a cameo from a famous historical figure , in this case @entity48			1
@entity1 also made headlines last week when he was offered the chance to write the next @entity52 novel			1
@entity1 is no stranger to the spy thriller genre and an admitted @entity52 enthusiast and @entity56 fan			1
accepting the job was , as he puts it , a " no - brainer			0
" while @entity1 is keeping many details of the superspy 's next adventure top secret , in an interview with @entity3 from his home in @entity24 he did give a few hints on what he has in store for 007 and talked at length about his new novel			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity3 : what was the spark behind " @entity75 " ? @entity1 : it 's an odd accumulation of things			1
i was sort of obsessed with @entity10 , particularly at the beginning of the 20th century			1
i 'd written a short story and a bit of a novel set there , and i was very interested in that period			1
then i got a chance to go there to write an article about @entity88 , the tormented artist who died very young			2
so i went to @entity10 for a few days and wandered around , and very early one morning i found myself at the @entity89 , which is his old apartment house , and i had this strange kind of proustian shiver as i stood outside the front door waiting to be admitted , because it 's been kept exactly as it was pretty much			1
i thought i could have been here 100 years ago coming to seek psychiatric aid to cure whatever problem i had			0
i suddenly thought what must that have been like to have come to a psychoanalyst all those years ago , and that was the beginning of the novel			0
it was a good moment			0
@entity3 : you invented your own psychotherapy for the novel ; tell me a little more about " parallelism			0
" @entity1 : i thought , should i just use one of the recognized therapies that @entity48 and @entity109 analysts use ? and i thought no , it would be much more fun to think up my own			1
so i came up with this idea of parallelism , which is surprisingly plausible , i think			0
we do it all the time , we have false memories , we misremember our past			0
the past is a very vague and blurry place for us			0
so it seemed to me to be possible to go back into your memories and reinvent them			0
to replace bad memories with highly detailed new memories , trying to erase the trauma and the neuroses and leave you with something benign			0
that 's a very simplified version of it and you would need to be guided by a therapist but fundamentally parallelism is creating a parallel life for yourself where the bad things did n't happen and only good things took place			2
see @entity1 discuss " parallelism " in his new novel @entity3 : you 've included a number of real people in your novels , @entity48 , @entity146 and @entity56 among others			1
what draws you to these historical figures ? @entity1 : all these people i 've written about , like @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 are all people i 'm very intrigued by , sometimes in a good way , sometimes in a slightly malicious way			1
i 've become quite interested in the @entity158 writer @entity157 , so she may appear in one of my fictions			0
i 've often invented fictitious events in real people 's lives			2
wherever my interest takes me , i 'm capable of imagining aspects of these people 's lives or imagining a portrait of them that is very much mine rather than something handed down by biographers or history			2
it 's very much a capricious way for me to get some of my prejudices or fan worship on the page			2
@entity3 : you 've been asked to write the next @entity52 novel ; what was your reaction when they approached you ? @entity1 : what an opportunity , particularly as i 'm sort of steeped in @entity56 's world and the world of espionage			1
i 'm relatively at home in it and i know a lot about @entity56 and his life and his circle			2
i read all the @entity52 novels as a younger person but now i 'm furiously re-reading them with great intent			1
so it was a great serendipitous opportunity that came my way because you ca n't audition for it , you ca n't volunteer to do it			0
you either get asked or you do n't			0
so when they said , " would you be interested ? " i said , " you bet			0
" i 'm really looking forward to it			0
it 's going to be great fun , but i 'm also going to take it extremely seriously			2
i 'm going to try to write the very best @entity52 novel i possibly can and take the character to places and situations he has n't been before			1
@entity3 : what do you have in store for the super spy ? @entity1 : i 'm going to be annoyingly tight - lipped about it			1
i can tell you it 's going to be set in 1969			2
@entity56 died in 1964 at the very young age of 56			0
so it 's quite conceivable if @entity56 had looked after himself a bit better , he might have been alive in 1969 and writing a @entity52 novel			1
by setting it then you 're very much in the world of @entity56 's @entity52			1
the resonances of the @entity52 that @entity56 created still would influence the @entity52 that i would write about			1
that to me is the real appeal			0
somehow you 're imagining a kind of vicarious life for @entity56 , whereby he might have been able to pen another @entity52 novel			2
it 's very much tapping into the world we 're familiar with			0
the @entity234 was alive and well and in some ways that 's the great age of spying , and i know a lot about that period of espionage history			0
so to be able to plonk down an iconic figure like @entity52 in the late ' 60s is a wonderful bonus			2
