-- the @entity1 secured a narrow 14 - 10 victory over @entity3 in @entity4 on saturday to square their rugby @entity5 at 1 - 1 , but @entity3 still secured the @entity7 for the first time since it was introduced in 2000 by virtue of their five - point victory in @entity12 last week			1
@entity13 goes over for @entity1 's only try in their narrow victory over @entity3 in @entity4			1
having been out - muscled and out - played 27 - 22 in the opening @entity18 , the @entity17 played with far greater intensity , physicality and urgency at a cold , wet and windy @entity22			1
a @entity13 try midway through the first half opened the scoring for the host nation before @entity26 slotted home a penalty for an 8 - 0 advantage at the break			0
the @entity32 reply was swift after the restart , with wing @entity34 crossing the line with a superb solo effort and then @entity39 's conversion getting them back into the game			0
but another @entity26 penalty and one from substitute @entity44 edged the @entity1 further ahead before a late three - pointer from @entity46 kept things interesting			2
meanwhile , a much - changed @entity49 side comfortably accounted for @entity50 34 - 12 in @entity51 on saturday			1
man - of - the - match @entity52 , who started on the bench , finished with two tries , one in each half , after coming on initially when @entity56 was blood - binned , then as a replacement for @entity58 at full - back			0
three first - half tries gave the @entity49 a 20 - 6 lead at the break and that was a fair reflection of the difference between the teams , but the hosts were held at bay for much of the second half before late tries by @entity70 and @entity52			0
@entity72 - born full - back @entity71 landed four penalties for @entity50 for whom fellow - @entity72 @entity74 was effective and creative in his second start at fly - half .			2
