-- @entity1 has called @entity2 the " funniest guy ever , " but , at times , @entity2 's sunny outlook has come at the expense of great loss			1
his big brother , @entity8 , died in a car accident in 1962 when @entity2 was 12			1
by the time he was 21 , he 'd lost his mother and father			2
his wife died of ovarian cancer in 2010			2
yet , through it all , @entity2 has kept in mind a valuable lesson he took to heart after @entity8 's death : " something terrible can happen to you , and yet , the day after this something terrible , the sun still rises , and life goes on			1
and therefore , so must you			2
" the actor and comedian , known for his stints on " @entity27 , " " @entity28 , " " @entity29 " and a number of movies , spoke to @entity0 about his memoir , " i must say : my life as a @entity34 " ( @entity35 ) , which comes out tuesday			1
in person , he is just as gracious , energetic and seemingly pixie dust - covered as the @entity2 who frequents late - night talk shows			1
the naturally cheerful @entity40 rejects the notion that he uses comedy to dull the pain			2
instead , he says , he has gained wisdom from the events			2
he looks at the bright side , even when thinking about loss			2
channeling @entity50 @entity2 never expected to hit it big			1
though he grew up idolizing @entity52 and hosted a faux variety show from his attic bedroom in his hometown of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity2 maintains he was too far , psychologically , from the @entity58 to harbor @entity60 dreams			1
the youngest of five , @entity2 grew up in a boisterous , fun - loving @entity63 - @entity62 family			1
his father , born in @entity65 , worked as a steel company executive			0
@entity2 's mother served as concertmistress of the symphony orchestra in @entity56			1
@entity2 was studying social work until his friend @entity71 persuaded him to give acting a chance			1
his second professional audition was in 1972 for the @entity75 production of " @entity76			0
" @entity77 and @entity71 were cast with @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , among others			0
@entity82 was the musical director			0
it was their collective big break			0
but @entity2 had a bigger break midway through the show 's 1972 - 73 run			1
he met a " forbiddingly attractive " understudy named @entity89			0
they started dating and eventually married			0
" the miracle of @entity92 and me is that once we started , " @entity2 wrote in the book , " we never stopped ; we remained forever devoted to each other			1
" even after " @entity76 , " he thought he 'd missed the boat			0
in the mid- 1970s , @entity79 and @entity82 headed to " @entity28			0
" pals like @entity71 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 were working on a pre- " @entity27 " show called " @entity27			0
" @entity2 felt like his own career was in a rut			1
@entity2 recalled a 1977 incident in which he froze in his tracks while walking along @entity107 ' @entity106			1
intimidated by his friends ' successes , he sat on a bench and silently brooded for 15 minutes as @entity89 held his hand			0
the breakdown was short - lived			2
the next day , @entity2 joined @entity75 's @entity114 troupe , where he debuted some of his most popular characters , including @entity50			1
originally , @entity50 was a device @entity2 used to defuse arguments between him and @entity89			1
when @entity2 was becoming too much for her to handle , she 'd summon @entity120 with his hunched shoulders and upper lip exposing his teeth ( the high hair would come later ) , sweet @entity50 would smooth things over in a way @entity2 confessed he was too stubborn to do			1
over time , @entity2 hiked up @entity50 's trousers , gelled his hair to a point and costumed his character in an old orange - checked shirt			1
the character became hugely popular			0
nevertheless , long after they moved to @entity107 , @entity2 noted in the book that @entity89 never let him forget about his moment on the bench			1
" look , honey , there 's @entity141 , " she would say			2
an all - star comedian he joined " @entity27 " in 1982			0
he still considers it his " most satisfying professional experience			0
" " there are certain times when the stars align and everything is ideal , " he said			0
" in this case the end result was fabulous			0
i was living in my hometown			0
i was working with lifelong friends			0
the product deserved to be loved			0
and those stars lining up do n't always happen			0
" " @entity27 " ended in 1984 , and @entity2 made the jump to " @entity28 " as part of what became known as the " all - star cast , " a group that included @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			1
" i had a one - year contract [ at ' snl ' ] , " @entity2 said , " so i knew i was not going to be there longer than a year , so i treated it like i had 22 specials to do that year			1
" shortly after his time on " @entity28 , " he made his feature film debut in 1986 's " three amigos ! " that film is also where @entity2 befriended @entity175 , with whom he would collaborate professionally many times , notably in the " @entity178 " films			1
he plays a depraved dentist in the forthcoming @entity181 film , " @entity182			0
" his work has not gone unnoticed			0
he won a @entity184 for his performance in the 1999 production of the musical " @entity187 " and has an @entity188 for writing " @entity27			0
" his other honors include being named to the @entity190			0
these days , @entity2 is probably most associated with his wild talk - show appearances , whether it 's on @entity194 's show -- he 's been a frequent guest -- or hosting his own , including " @entity29			1
" @entity194 , he said , has been a stalwart , and he 'll miss the longtime star , who 's retiring next year			1
" i 'm deeply sad to see him retire , because i think he has a completely unique voice on television , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's a voice that people trust			2
" i keep going back to the first show after 9/11			0
he was the first one back and people were watching his lead			0
he was so profound in that moment			0
and then , again , when he was memorializing @entity207			0
and he 's so deeply funny , and so original			2
there 's no one like him , " he added			2
" it 's horrifying to think no @entity212			1
" but for a guy who both loves and mocks showbiz , there 's one brush with fame that stands out			2
several years ago , @entity2 met @entity220 , who was fond of one of @entity2 's lesser projects : the 1994 oddball cult favorite " @entity225 , " in which the 40 - ish @entity2 played a bizarre 10 - year - old boy			1
@entity227 , she told @entity2 , was " a total ' @entity225 ' freak			1
" @entity2 still seems surprised			2
" it was the most random thing i ever thought i 'd hear upon meeting @entity220			2

@entity2 's memoir details love , loss , life and celebrity encounters
the comic actor maintains a sunny *disposition* despite *significant* *heartbreak*
short : @entity220 told me she was " a total @entity225 freak "
short on @entity194 's retirement : " it 's horrifying to think no @entity246 on tv "
