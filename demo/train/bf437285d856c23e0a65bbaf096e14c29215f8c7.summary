" @entity99 said in a written statement saturday that his forces received information about where she was held and " decided that , given the danger she was facing , her best chance of safe release was to act on that information			0
" responsibility for this tragic outcome rests squarely with the hostage takers , " @entity99 said			0
" from the moment they took her , her life was under grave threat			0
given who held her , and the danger she was in , we judged that @entity17 's best chance lay in attempting to rescue her			2
