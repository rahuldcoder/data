-- even during the harshest periods of the communist era , being @entity1 had a special cachet in @entity5			1
the city and its residents were a synonym for @entity10 fashion and open - minded attitudes , as different as could be from their @entity13 - pin wearing comrades			1
its personality remains just as strong today			0
@entity17 is an unusual place			1
it 's @entity5 , but not entirely ; its hybrid of eastern and @entity10 business and social traditions is found nowhere else in mainland @entity5			1
here are the things that make @entity5 's booming commercial hub a unique place in the world 's most populous country			1
the @entity29 a number of pockets in @entity5 have impressive @entity10 buildings -- the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity36 buildings in @entity37 -- but none provide the surreal feeling of " elsewhereness " like the @entity29			1
the @entity29 refers to @entity17 's waterfront on the west bank of @entity43			1
two dozen colossal @entity10 structures , ranging in style from art deco to @entity47 , stand side by side , forming a massive marble curtain			1
view it from afar and you 'd think you were sailing into @entity52			0
the 1,500 - meter - long strip is a legacy passed down by one of the city 's former rulers , @entity58			1
it was largely built in the late - 19th and early - 20th centuries to establish @entity17 as the @entity61 's trading hub of the @entity62			1
the most magnificent building is today 's number 10 - 12 , the former @entity66 building			0
when completed in 1923 , the seven - story neoclassical landmark was dubbed " the most luxurious building from the @entity69 to the @entity70			0
" the building 's original ceiling mural managed to survive the @entity73 ; the octagonal mosaic painting is one of the best - kept secrets in @entity17			1
it 's now in the lobby of @entity78 , the building 's current occupier			0
with the financial center 's move to the east bank of @entity43 , the old @entity29 has become a new home for world - class hotels , restaurants and retailers			2
skyscrapers according to @entity89 , a global real estate data provider based in @entity91 , @entity17 ranks sixth among world cities with the most skyscrapers			1
there are 241 skyscrapers in @entity17 , eight fewer than @entity96 , 14 more than in @entity97 and 103 more than the second mainland city on the list , @entity100			1
although towering blocks mushroom throughout the metropolis , the skyscraper center point is the @entity104			0
on the opposite side of the traditional @entity29 , @entity105 appears so futuristic that it 's become a @entity109 favorite as a setting for films , most recently featured in " her " with @entity113			0
@entity105 is home to the most recognized high - rises in @entity5 , including the 468 - meter @entity116 , the 421 - meter @entity117 and the 492 - meter @entity118			1
since 1994 , each of them has had a turn as the tallest structure in @entity5			1
next in line is the 632 - meter @entity124			0
scheduled to open in 2015 , the 121 - story building is set to host what it claims will be world 's tallest luxury hotel , @entity131 hotel			2
the 258 - room hotel -- a joint venture between @entity134 and @entity135 -- will occupy the 84th through 110th floors of the @entity124			0
international events and entertainment when international events set up in @entity5 , @entity17 is as often as not the default host city			1
large - scale events in @entity143 tend to carry political messages , while those in @entity17 focus more on fun and glamor			1
the @entity5 @entity147 is one of the biggest annual events in @entity17			1
it 's the only @entity151 stop in mainland @entity5			1
the @entity153 ( october 4 - 12 ) tennis championship is attended by the highest - ranking players of the year			0
the week - long event is part of the @entity157			2
@entity17 is also building a @entity158			1
set to open toward the end of 2015 , @entity158 will be the first @entity160 theme park in mainland @entity5 ( @entity161 opened in 2005 ) and the sixth in the world			1
the $ 5.5 - billion investment will further promote @entity165 and @entity166 in the realm of the @entity168			0
international food high - quality international restaurants are springing up in @entity17 so quickly that it 's hard to keep track of them all			2
new kitchens often set up on the @entity29 , around @entity175 and in the former @entity176 , as rivals to the established fine - dining scene in @entity143			0
but look beyond the glitzy restaurant menus and into the homes of private residents , and you 'll see a tradition of international cuisine found nowhere else in @entity5			1
the city 's @entity61 rulers and @entity36 refugees may be long gone , but their food has remained			2
@entity190 sauce , that classic condiment from the @entity192 , has a brother some 9,000 kilometers from home			0
known locally as " spicy soy sauce , " shanghainese @entity190 sauce was first produced in 1930 to cater to the large expat market			0

the hearty beef and vegetable soup has evolved into @entity17 's favorite comfort food			2
local mothers usually cook it to treat friends and families			0
@entity214 @entity213 colonial history has trickled down to @entity17 's local lingo			1

a spring lock is called " si ba lin			0
" cement is " si men ting			0

@entity17 dialect is incomprehensible to a typical @entity227 speaker , whose language is largely based on pronunciation and vocabulary from northern @entity5			1
@entity231 @entity231 is @entity17 's indigenous alleyway housing			2
series of stone buildings were built in the 1870s as a way to accommodate the city 's rapidly growing immigrant families			0
when the @entity240 took over in 1949 , shikumen architecture was at its height -- there were around 200,000 shikumen buildings throughout central @entity17 , each divided into tenements to house five or even ten families			2
as modern high - rises in @entity17 have grabbed international attention , however , these local architectural treasures have been ignored or even shoved aside			2
since the 1990s , shikumen buildings have been getting pulled down more quickly than the skyscrapers rise			0
but you can still find them in a few corners			0
in @entity175 , high - end restaurants , pubs and clubs have taken over the revamped old buildings			0
@entity259 is a more @entity260 area			0
in its labyrinth of alleyways , indie designers hang up cocktail dresses next to self - employed vendors selling replica communist souvenirs in the courtyard			0
for more authentic shikumen neighborhoods , @entity270 on @entity271 , and @entity272 on @entity273 , are throwbacks to a uniquely @entity17 experience that 's rapidly disappearing			2
