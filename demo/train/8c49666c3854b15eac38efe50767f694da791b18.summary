-- @entity2 's impressive record of winning matches that go to three sets in 2012 shows no sign of ending after the @entity7 beat @entity8 in the @entity9 fourth round to set up a quarterfinal meeting with @entity11			1
@entity2 won 6 - 1 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , but was rattled by @entity8 winning four games in a row that enabled the 19th seed to take the second set and lead 2 - 0 in the third before an hour and 13 minute rain break			1
the @entity18 seed took full advantage of the delay , speaking to her father @entity21 , before returning to seal a two hour , 14 - minute victory to give @entity2 her 11th win in three - set matches in 2012 and her 23rd victory in 24 three - setters since the start of 2011			1
" it 's a nice statistic , " said @entity2 after her last 16 win over her fellow @entity7			1
" i do n't really think about it going into a new third set situation , because every match is different , whether you started slow and came back in the second , or whether you had a letdown in the second			2
" but overall , i always think that no matter how you start the match , it 's always how you finish			2
whether it 's an hour or three hours you 're out on the court , i do n't want to give up until the last point			2
" that 's pretty much the mentality i try to have going into a third set			2
" having been in the lead in the third set , @entity8 found the defeat difficult to take			1
" i had been in control in the third set , " said the @entity47 seed			0

" @entity2 looked hesitant and she could n't get a hold of her game			2
but then after the rain break , actually it went in her favour because she had time to think , regroup , talk to her coach			0
" and then she came out completely cool and collected			0
she started playing big tennis			0
unfortunately , luck was on her side			0
" @entity60 cruises into last 16 with revenge win over @entity62 @entity63 @entity11 also had to come from behind to beat the fifth seed @entity65 , but did so in style , winning 12 of 13 games to take a 1 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 victory			1
earlier on sunday defending champion @entity69 ended 18 - year - old @entity71 @entity70 's impressive @entity9 run with a 6 - 4 6 - 4 win in the fourth round of the @entity9			1
@entity74 , who had beaten @entity75 and @entity76 to reach the fourth round , saved eight match points as she came from 5 - 2 down to get back on serve but @entity80 @entity69 broke again to clinch victory and a match with top seed @entity83			1
" i 'm definitely disappointed , " said former @entity84 junior champion @entity74 , who will rise from 89th to 75th in the rankings after doing so well at @entity86			0
" i felt like i did n't play as well as i did in my last three matches			0
i just hit too many unforced errors			0
