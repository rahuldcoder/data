in a bold political and legal move , the @entity1 administration formally expressed its support for same - sex marriage in @entity5 , setting up a high stakes political and constitutional showdown at the @entity9 @entity8 over a fast - evolving and contentious issue			1
in a broadly worded legal brief on thursday that senior government sources said had president @entity1 's personal input and blessing , the @entity11 asserted gay and lesbian couples in the nation 's most populous state have the same " equal protection " right to wed and that voters there were not empowered to ban it			1
" use of a voter initiative to promote democratic self - governance can not save a law like @entity30 that would otherwise violate equal protection , " said the brief			1
" @entity33 may not however be the basis for differential treatment under the law			0
" @entity5 's 2008 @entity30 referendum revoked the right of same - sex couples to wed after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it			1
while the administration weighed in on the situation in @entity5 , it specifically refused to argue the constitutional right for same - sex couples to wed there should be extended to the 41 states that currently define marriage as between one man and one woman			1
the justices will hear the case in march			0
" the government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law , " said attorney general @entity52			0
" throughout history , we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination			0
" " the issues before the @entity8 in this case and the @entity66 case are not just important to the tens of thousands @entity9 who are being denied equal benefits and rights under our laws , but to our nation as a whole , " @entity52 added			1
the @entity73 was not expected to issue a separate statement			0
the @entity5 matter and another appeal over the federal @entity66 will produce blockbuster rulings from the justices in coming months			0
same - sex marriage could be a defining moment in @entity1 's presidency , similar to the political impact last year when the @entity8 upheld the health care reform law he spearheaded			1
he must decide how much political capital to expend in coming months when expressing his views and those of the executive branch			0
gay rights groups had privately urged @entity1 and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right to marry and come down " on the side of history			1
" opinion : 2013 -- a year for big issues in the courts @entity1 has already faced strong opposition on the issue from many @entity103 state and congressional lawmakers , as well as social conservatives			2
the justices will hear oral arguments in the @entity30 case march 26 , with a ruling due by the last week of june			0
the separate case over the @entity66 involves a 1996 law that says for federal purposes , marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman			0
that means federal tax , @entity117 , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , and family medical leave protections do not apply to gay and lesbian couples			1
that case will be argued march 27			0
but it is the @entity5 case where the high court is being asked to establish the constitutional " equal protection " right			1
the administration is not a party in the appeal and was not required to weigh in , but it decided to file an amicus or " friend of the court " brief			2
it is rare for a president to be personally involved in the legal and political considerations in a high court appeal , and sources say he spent a good deal of time reading up on the issue and articulating his views privately			0
much of the legal reasoning in any government brief would reflect in large part his personal thinking , gained from his years as a former constitutional law professor			0
@entity1 administration weighs in on defense of marriage law there are about approximately 120,000 legally married same - sex couples in the @entity9			1
the administration , in its brief , also hinted that so - called " civil union " laws in @entity5 and seven other states may be unconstitutional			2
in what some have labeled the " eight - state strategy , " the @entity11 argues civil union and domestic partnership laws in @entity5 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , and @entity170 may be unconstitutional and that they should go all the way and grant them full marriage rights			2
" the object of @entity5 's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same - sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple			1
but proposition 8 , by depriving same - sex couples of the right to marry , denies them the dignity , respect , and stature accorded similarly situated opposite - sex couples under state law , " the court brief said			1
such civil union laws in most cases provide the same rights of marriage under state law , without actually calling it that			2
dozens of advocacy groups on both sides of the issue have bombarded the high court with briefs , including a coalition of national republicans , business , faith , and military leaders supporting same - sex marriage			1
among the prominent conservative names lending their view : former @entity212 governor and presidential candidate @entity211 , @entity215 chief executive and former @entity5 gubernatorial candidate @entity216 , @entity9 rep. @entity217 ( @entity218 ) , and actor @entity219			0
" as a @entity103 , i believe in protecting individual freedoms and that everyone , including gay and lesbian @entity9 , has a constitutional right to be treated equally under the law , " said former rep. @entity220			2
@entity5 state officials , including gov. @entity227 , a @entity228 , also weighed in to oppose proposition 8			0
" @entity5 's interests in protecting all of its children are best served by allowing these same - sex couples to enjoy the same benefits of marriage as opposite - sex couples , " state attorney general @entity230 said of the estimated 50,000 youngsters being raised by gay and lesbian couples in the state			1
@entity1 has had an evolving position on gay rights , once supporting only civil unions			2
but in his inaugural address last month , he raised expectations , and perhaps signaled his impending legal views , when offering sweeping rhetoric			0
" our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well			2
" opinion : gay @entity9 pay more taxes for fewer rights in february , a federal appeals court in @entity260 ruled the @entity5 measure unconstitutional			0
in its split decision , the panel found that @entity30 " works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians " by denying their right to civil marriage			0
the @entity8 has discretion to rule narrowly or broadly on the aspects of the legal and procedural questions raised			2
