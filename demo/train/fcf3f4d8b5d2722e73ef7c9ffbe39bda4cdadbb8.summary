@entity0 -- @entity3 will on friday begin enforcing an evacuation order on a 20 - kilometer zone around the @entity7 nuclear power plant , a top government official said			1
the restriction -- in place since the early days of the nuclear disaster -- has often been ignored			2
many of the about 78,000 people who have homes in the evacuation zone have gone back in recent weeks to retrieve belongings , and check on farms and businesses			2
no one will be allowed within 3 kilometers of the crippled nuclear facility and entry within 20 kilometers of the plant will be highly regulated , chief cabinet secretary @entity18 told reporters thursday			1
people who temporarily return to their homes , businesses and farms must wear a protective suit and ride into the restricted zone on a designated bus			0
the time limit for such visits will be two hours and everyone who enters will be required to go through a decontamination process			0
the stricter enforcement within the zone is necessary " to guarantee the health and safety of the people , " @entity18 said previously , noting that @entity0 will work with local officials in closing the zone			1
@entity18 said the government plans to designate the area an " alert zone " under @entity3 laws governing disaster response , a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area			2
police are currently stationed at checkpoints leading into the area , but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer			0
a @entity1 crew entered the area for a short time wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20 - km ( 12.5 - mile ) boundary			1
he said his father was considering returning home -- but as a young , unmarried man , he was considering quitting the farm his family has worked for three generations			0
" i 'm concerned about the impact on my health , " said the farmer , who declined to be named			0
" i wish i could trust the government , but i ca n't			1
" the disaster , now the worst nuclear accident since @entity74 , occurred when the @entity7 plant was struck by the march 11 tsunami that devastated northern @entity3 , knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat			2
the plant 's operator , @entity79 , said thursday that a meltdown could be taking place at the troubled facility , but also acknowledged that there 's no way to know for sure			0
@entity79 told @entity1 that it can not say that the nuclear fuel rods at the three reactors have never melted or that they are not melting right now , nor can the company say for certain that the rods have melted or are melting now			1
the @entity3 government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20 - km zone			1
but journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour			0
by comparison , a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year			0
one reporter who came within 2 kilometers of the power plant in early april recorded a dose of about a tenth of a millisievert per hour -- high enough to increase the long - term risk of cancer with prolonged exposure , but a tiny fraction of the dose that would induce radiation sickness .			1
