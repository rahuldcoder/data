@entity0 -- on the second page of the executive summary of the 9/11 commission report is a line we should all remember : " [ @entity7 ] he 9/11 attacks were a shock but they should not have been a surprise			1
@entity13 extremists had given plenty of warning that they meant to kill @entity15 indiscriminately and in large numbers			0
" @entity17 could easily have gone into history as another day nearly as infamous as @entity19 day or 9/11			1
the @entity15 was attacked , allegedly by @entity20 , who got past whatever security precautions might have stopped him from boarding @entity22 for @entity23 , @entity24			1
if the attack had been successful , 279 passengers and 11 crew members would probably be dead , and we would n't be discussing @entity29 hiding behind closed doors to wrap up a health care bill			0
thankfully no one was killed , and the threat was stopped by the incompetence of the would - be bomber , not the competence of our security apparatus			1
homeland security secretary @entity39 said immediately after the incident that " the system worked , " intending to refer to what happened after the failed bombing			1
but people took it as a defense of the overall system , and she had to spend time clarifying her comment afterward			0
clearly the system did n't work			0
her boss , the president , made that plain in his comments tuesday : " the bottom line is this : the @entity15 government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the @entity17 attack , but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots which would have placed the suspect on the no - fly list , " @entity53 said			1
and now we find out our most important ally , @entity64 , also had sufficient intelligence and had warned us in advance about @entity20			0
pre- 9/11 , our guard was down			1
airport security was a joke , and our national intelligence apparatus was a bunch of fiefdoms that did n't want to cooperate and would n't share information with each other			1
in the aftermath of that great @entity15 tragedy , 9/11 , the system was supposed to be fixed			1
the @entity79 was created and all intelligence was put under one entity , headed by the director of national intelligence			0
but the failures outlined tuesday are the same failures that caused 9/11			2
why have we as @entity15 spent billions of dollars , inconvenienced our lives , and lost many of our own freedoms ? and in spite of the fortunate outcome in @entity23 , is this next decade going to be one in which @entity15 lose more freedoms ? or is it going to be one in which we say , " stop ! i am not going to be intimidated			1
" i know we live in a dangerous time , but are we letting the other side win by letting our way of life be taken away from us by being overly cautious and maybe even overprotected ? how come every time a system breaks down , we citizens are made to endure more ? even before the president and his homeland security secretary issue their new travel guidelines , i know more of my personal freedoms are going to be eroded			1
as someone who has traveled extensively , i now look at going to an airport with the same dread i felt as a kid going to the dentist			2
i know it is going to be a painful experience			0
if i thought for one moment the @entity114 teams ( 50,000 plus strong ) at the airport , who treat me as a potential terrorist , could actually catch a real terrorist , i might be a more willing victim of their harassment			2
i now have to be searched , my computer and @entity122 stacked separately , shoes off ( thanks to @entity124 , another incompetent bomber ) , belt , wallet , watch and whatever else taken out , and have my ticket and @entity129 checked every 10 feet even though i am in their secure space			0
now my underwear is to be viewed as a secret weapon			0
how does a man on a watch list , whose very own father turns him in as a potential terrorist , plunk down $ 3,000 in cash and get on a plane anywhere ? we as taxpayers are now spending billions on airport security and other intelligence to keep us safe			1
my challenge is : get what you need , but get it right ! no more excuses			0
when i worked in the @entity150 , i was told it was the big leagues			0
zero defects was the rule			0
it was like the @entity155 and you had to perform at the very top level or you were gone			0
we have just finished the regular season of the @entity155 and there are some lessons to be learned from that sport			0
do n't perform and you are fired			2
eight years after 9/11 , the system failed			2
mr. president , follow the example of your neighbor , the unpopular @entity170 owner @entity168 , and hold someone accountable			2
@entity168 fired his general manager and his football coach for a failed season			2
you need to fire someone for the security failures			2
this is the second big - time security failure this year -- the @entity150 gate crashers and now the @entity23 bomber			1
the two agencies that have failed security big - time are the @entity181 and @entity114			1
the person in charge of both agencies is @entity39			1
fire her and convince us that standing in long lines at airports is worth the price			0
getting mad is not enough , mr. president			0
but you can do something about it ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

before 9/11 , airport security was a joke and agencies *feuded* , @entity195 says
he says @entity23 incident shows similar *problems* persist
@entity53 needs to do more than get mad , he must hold someone *responsible* , @entity195 says
he says homeland security secretary @entity39 should be fired
