@entity1 is blind and we hired so many guards , how did we lose him and what exactly would he do once he was out ? q : is @entity5 the kind of country you want to bring your children up ? a : after @entity1 got out , the government was persuading me to stay here			1
but they were also tightening their grip on me			0
if they ever get us back home , they would put us in an iron cage			0
q : what would you say to secretary of state @entity136 ? a : i know @entity5 - @entity24 relations encompass many issues and they have to consider many things			1
but the reality about my family is that our lives are in obvious danger			0
if we stay here or get sent back to @entity97 , our lives would be at stake			0
under such circumstances , i hope the @entity24 government will protect us and help us leave @entity5 based on its value of protecting human rights			1
q : are you prepared for not being allowed back ? a : we are prepared because our current situation is very dangerous ... they made many promises			0
but right now , we ca n't even freely use our phone			0
i ca n't even freely walk out of the hospital			2
friends ca n't visit us			0
it just proves that our human rights are not being protected			0
q : are there people watching you at the hospital ? a : they have security guards here			2
q : have the embassy people have left ? a : yes			2
they promised to stay here with @entity1 -- that would give us some sense of security			1
