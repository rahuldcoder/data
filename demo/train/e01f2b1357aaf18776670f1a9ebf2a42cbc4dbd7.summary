-- linguists announced monday they have identified an endangered language known as @entity3 that is spoken by about 800 people in northeast @entity5			1
the language was unknown to science and recently came to light during an expedition by linguists traveling in @entity5 on fellowships for @entity13 , the linguists said in telephone interviews			1
@entity3 belongs to the @entity16 language family , which is composed of a group of about 400 languages spoken primarily in east , central , south and southeast @entity20 and includes @entity21 and @entity22 , according to linguist @entity23			1
some 150 @entity16 languages are spoken in @entity5 alone , but no other language has been identified as closely related , said @entity23 , an associate professor of linguistics at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
like most languages , @entity3 is unwritten and transmitted orally			2
it is neither a dialect nor a sister language close to @entity34 , despite being considered such by both @entity35 and @entity3 people			1
@entity3 shares some vocabulary with other languages spoken in the region but shares more features with languages spoken farther east , such as @entity45 and @entity46 , the linguists said in a news release issued by @entity13			1
@entity23 and another @entity48 , @entity49 , led the expedition , called @entity51 , which brought @entity3 to light			2
enduring voices documents vanishing languages and cultures and assists with language revitalization			0
@entity23 and @entity49 , director of the @entity58 , in @entity59 , @entity60 , focused on @entity61 , a remote area of northeast @entity5 that is considered the black hole of the linguistic world			1
it is a language hotspot where there is room to study rich , diverse languages , many unwritten or documented			0
a permit is required to visit , few linguists have worked there and a reliable list of languages has never been drawn up			0
" on a scientist 's tally sheet , @entity3 adds just one entry to the list of 6,909 languages worldwide			2
but @entity3 's contribution is much greater than that tiny fraction would suggest , " @entity23 writes in his book , " @entity80			1
" " @entity3 brings an entirely different perspective , history , mythology , technology and grammar to what was known before			2
" in the news release , the linguists described their discovery as bittersweet : of the approximately 800 people who speak @entity3 , few are under the age of 20 , meaning the language is endangered			1
" we were finding something that was making its exit , was on its way out , " @entity49 said			0
" and if we had waited 10 years to make the trip , we might not have come across close to the number of speakers we found			0
" the team set out in 2008 in @entity61 to document @entity34 and @entity104 , languages spoken in a small district there			0
the expedition went door to door among homes propped up on stilts to reach potential speakers of those little - known languages			0
while recording the vocabularies , they detected a third language -- @entity3			2
it was not listed in @entity5 language surveys , @entity5 censuses or standard international registries			1
" we did n't have to get far on our word list to realize it was extremely different in every possible way , " @entity23 said			0
the inventory of sounds and the way these sounds were combined to form words were distinct from other languages spoken in the region			2
an @entity34 speaker would call a pig " vo " and a @entity3 speaker would call a pig " lele			0
" " @entity3 could hardly sound more different from @entity35 , " @entity23 writes			0
" they sound as different as , say , @entity136 and @entity137			0
" @entity49 and @entity23 said @entity138 is the traditional language of the region 's historic slave traders , and they hypothesized that @entity3 may have sprung from the slaves ; though they said more study is needed to determine the origin			1
the project reports that a language becomes extinct every two weeks			0
by 2100 , it is estimated that more than half of the 6,910 languages spoken on earth will vanish			0
the team will return to @entity5 to continue studying @entity3 in november .			1

@entity3 is spoken by only about 800 people , few of them under the age of 20
linguists traveling in northeast @entity5 came upon the language
@entity3 was not listed in any @entity5 language surveys or other sources
