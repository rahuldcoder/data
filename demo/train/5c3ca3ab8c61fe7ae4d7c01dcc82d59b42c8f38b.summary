-- fast - food restaurants that have long catered to the hungry patron with super-sized entrees are now targeting the nibbler , offering smaller , snack - sized portions			1
@entity6 is the latest eatery to shrink a popular menu item			2
in late july , it plans to roll out a 7 - ounce @entity10 , 5 ounces tinier than its current " small " frozen treat			1
" our customers really wanted it , " said @entity12 , @entity6 's associate vice president of communications			2
" they really requested a smaller - portion size of our blizzard -- smaller appetites			2
we also felt there was an opportunity there with a smaller size @entity10 -- which is our signature product -- to perhaps bundle it with a combo meal or a food meal , as well			1
" @entity6 is n't the only big - name restaurant shrinking menu items			2
last february , @entity27 introduced a line of mini-burgers called " @entity30			1
" executives at the time touted that while the product " might look small ... they are full of the big , flame - broiled taste			0
" @entity37 's @entity36 also hit stores last year			0
this offering relocates the innards of the @entity41 -- burger , pickle , special sauce , lettuce , cheese -- in a tortilla to create a small burger - burrito hybrid			0
there have been sporadic attempts to downsize on fast - food menus in recent years			1
@entity53 - based @entity52 , began offering a tiny wrap sandwich called the @entity55 geared to snackers in 2007			0
and doughnut shops like @entity58 have fed the masses with doughnut holes rebranded as " munchkins " ( or @entity62 , if you 're a patron of @entity64 )			1
@entity6 unveiled its @entity10 after seven months of testing in about 100 of its 5,700 stores			1
the new size comes on the 25th birthday of the frozen treat and the 70th anniversary of the chain			0
" we really felt that this was an opportune time to introduce our @entity10 to all of our loyal customers , and of course people can come in more often and enjoy their favorite @entity10 flavor , " @entity12 says			0
but just because the menu item shrinks does n't mean it will stick around			0
despite a twilight - themed media blitz in 2009 , @entity30 have disappeared from the @entity27 menu			1
officials were n't immediately available for comment as to why .			0
