a bourbon heist at a high - end @entity2 distillery has left tongues wagging in elite whiskey circles and some small - town cops wondering whodunit			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 noticed this week that it was missing some of its 20 - year - old @entity9 , one of the rarest and most sought after bourbons in the world			1
" it 's highly coveted , " said @entity14 sheriff @entity13 , the man leading the investigation			1
" it 's the best of the best			0
" @entity13 said the distillery called him on tuesday to report that 65 cases , or 195 bottles , of the high - end hard stuff were unaccounted for			1
nine cases of @entity23 were also missing			2
" we believe whoever did this took them out the back from the secured area over a period of two months " @entity13 said			0
" obviously , the way this happened , it 's indicative of an inside job			1
" @entity7 did not respond to requests for comment , but @entity13 said the distillery employs about 50 people and operates two shifts			2
just how coveted is @entity9 ? while the listed retail price is $ 130 per bottle , the bourbon is so rare that consumers usually end up paying much more to get a bottle , if they can find one , said @entity46 of @entity47			1
" there is a lot of mystery around how to even get one , " he said			0
one place to get one is online retailer @entity55 , where a bottle of 20 - year - old @entity9 costs $ 1,199			1
" it 's the pinnacle of bourbon , " gushed @entity57			2
" if you 're around a bottle , it 's a special occasion			0

" if you keep bourbon in the right conditions , it will be good forever			0
" " you have to wonder what 's going to happen to the 195 stolen bottles , " said @entity75 , ceo of the all - things cocktail website @entity77			2
