-- in the wake of the @entity4 decision that struck down key portions the @entity6 , i celebrated this historic milestone like many @entity8 as a step toward acceptance of all people			2
even though i 'm straight , i relate to my @entity13 brothers and sisters as i also struggle for others ' acceptance			2
by all accounts , i appear to be a completely average 27 - year - old female			2
i was never the kind of person who thought i 'd champion for individual rights or equality			2
sure , i believe in it , but i 'm not the stereotypical " @entity28 " protestor or gay rights advocate			2
on the outside , i look like many of my peers ; i wear skinny jeans and @entity33			2
i play on my @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
i tend to blend seamlessly into the background of average female faces			2
however , i realize that my life as a typical twentysomething will not last long			2
as time goes on , i will start to become more and more isolated from my peer group as my secret comes out			2
you see , i do n't want children			1
at first mention , this might seem like a minor comment			2
however , it is a choice that i feel has alienated me from my peers and will continue to do so as i creep toward middle age			0
the realization that i am somehow different is how i found myself standing up for my own personal beliefs and , along the way , championing equal rights for all			1
although i know that i do not share the same predicament as gays and lesbians , i use the comparison to explain that i , too , am seeking acceptance in a world in which i often feel ostracized and out of place			1
i identify with many of my gay and lesbian friends in that i 've always felt i should be honest about who i was			1
i do n't think it 's right to have to say , " well , we 'll have kids someday , " just as i do n't think it 's right for a gay man to have to say , " someday i 'll meet a nice girl and settle down			1
" like him , this is simply who i am			0
my " coming out " has been met with mixed reactions from family members			1
when i told my parents , my dad was quietly accepting and my mom cried endlessly			0
she did n't understand right away			1
later , she accepted it and now supports my stand for equality			0
my husband and i argued about whether we should tell his parents			0
i said we should , while he said we should just say " not now			0
" but i think that 's being dishonest about who we are and even wonder if he is ashamed or not fully committed to our decision , although he says he is			1
i tell him he 's still " in the closet " -- or perhaps even on the fence			1
i have a hard time identifying with people who do have children and have felt the brunt of many of their judgments			1
i have been called selfish and materialistic			0
but i do n't believe that i am selfish by any means for making this responsible choice			1
it would be far more selfish to have a child for the wrong reasons			0
the pressure is particularly intense living in a military town in the @entity107			0
i 've had women tell me that i was a horrible person , a horrible wife and a horrible @entity8 because it was my " duty " to reproduce			0
i was shocked to hear such a statement in 2013			0
i was born in the 1980s -- what i thought was an age of enlightenment in which women no longer were pigeonholed into such archaic stereotypes			0
i have stated that i do n't want children ; now i ought to state what i do want			1
i want people to know that i like children			1
people assume i hate them			0
i have worked with children and have found it to be an incredibly rewarding experience			1
i want others to know that i am a practical person			0
i do n't feel that it is right to raise a child in a home full of stress			1
i do n't have an incredibly high - paying job , and i worry that i 'll be burdened by student loan debt when i graduate from my doctoral program			1
a child is not a cute accessory that you drop off at day care and pick up at night			0
i realize that there is a commitment associated with raising a child , and it is not a commitment that i wish to make			0
i take commitments very seriously and think each and every decision through using logic and reasoning , and i 've made this decision that same way			0
' i am nobody 's mother and i never will be ' i want to be celebrated for what i have achieved and who i am as a person , not for what i am allegedly lacking			1
i want those who 've offered to pray for me to direct their intentions and sympathies toward those who really need it			0
i have a great life			0
i have achieved almost all of my educational goals			0
i have a husband whom i love and a job that makes me happy			0
to waste sympathy on me would be abhorrent			1
i want to start an educated , informed discourse			0
i do n't want to be spoken to in condescending tones and told that this is just a phase			1
i am not a small child who has developed finicky eating habits			0
i am a grown , responsible adult woman who has made a decision			1
just as gays and lesbians do not " outgrow " their orientations , i do n't believe that i will outgrow mine either			1
i want people to know that i do have a family			1
there are people who believe that i should not have married my husband because we do n't plan to reproduce			1
i ca n't help but wonder : is a family not made up of people who love and care for each other ? is there a minimum quota to be considered a family ? last time i checked , there was n't			1
are two people raising their offspring in an environment of anger , violence or poverty better people than my husband and i , whose house is filled with happiness and love ? i want people to know that writing this essay is the boldest thing i have ever done in my life			2
i realize that by publishing it , i run the risk of being ostracized and alienated by many people			0
it is a risk i am willing to take			0
like the equal rights crusaders before me who have challenged the beliefs of society with regard to race , gender and sexual orientation , i realize that my views will not always be popular			0
i just wish to do my part in creating a society that allows everyone , regardless of personal choices , to be accepted and able to express themselves freely without fear of judgment			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity228 feels *discrimination* as a woman who does n't want children
she 's been met with mixed reactions after " coming out " to family and friends
