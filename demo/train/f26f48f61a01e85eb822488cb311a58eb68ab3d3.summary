-- on wednesday , the @entity2 @entity1 issued its unanimous ruling in two cases testing the authority of police to conduct a warrantless search of an arrested person 's cell phone , holding that police generally must obtain a warrant before searching the cell phone of someone they arrest			1
for the most part , the justices ' rulings in cases dealing with the @entity19 go largely unnoticed by the public , but the court has reminded us in this opinion that modern technology is subject to the same original privacy rights that flow from the @entity27			1
most citizens are not interested in these cases the way they are in issues like same - sex marriage or gun control			2
on the whole , @entity2 do n't worry too much about search - and - seizure issues because they think these cases do n't apply to them			1
" those cases only apply to criminals			2
" " i 'm not planning on getting arrested			0
" " i have nothing to hide			0
" the sentiment is understandable			0
most of these cases involve application of the " exclusionary rule " to throw out evidence like guns or drugs , based on the way it was seized			0
but this does not mean that only criminal defendants have an interest here			0
the rest of us should pay attention for two reasons			1
first , most people do n't realize how easy it is for the police to arrest a person and seize his or her property			2
second , our private information is no longer on a piece of paper in a safe			0
it 's in the form of data , and it 's on our person , or in that thing they call the " cloud			0
" if police can access your cell phone without a warrant , they can access your entire life			1
do n't believe me ? what 's in your cell phone right now ? is there anything you would n't want a stranger swiping through ? how about the apps on your phone ? do you do any banking or other transactions on there ? cell phones not only contain data -- they are now becoming a portal beyond the device itself , into a third - party world , whether that 's your health information , your finances , or anything else out there in the cloud			1
and if you 're like most people , you 're not immune to arrest			2
police can potentially arrest you for minor infractions like littering , jaywalking , and traffic offenses			0
and just because they arrest you , should they be able to swipe through your pictures and text messages ? police can search containers on your person without a warrant if they contain evidence that might be destroyed , or a potential weapon			2
unless you can throw your @entity119 like a ninja shuriken , it 's probably not much of a weapon			0
the two cases decided wednesday by the @entity1 involved somewhat different factual situations			1
in @entity125 v. @entity126 , the case involved a stop for a traffic violation , which led to @entity125 's arrest on weapons charges			0
an officer performed a " search incident to arrest " ( one conducted without a warrant ) and accessed information on a phone in @entity125 's pocket			1
he saw on the phone the repeated use of gang terminology			0
a later search at the station of the phone 's digital contents led to @entity125 being charged in a gang shooting			2
the @entity2 v. @entity145 case involved an arrest after police observed @entity145 engage in a drug sale			0
as in @entity125 , the officers seized a cell phone and noticed on the screen that the phone was receiving multiple calls from " my house			1
" the officers opened the phone , traced the " my house " number to an apartment , obtained a search warrant and found drugs , a firearm and other bad stuff			1
in deciding these two appeals , the @entity1 ruled that the police generally may not , absent a warrant , search digital information on a mobile phone seized from an arrestee			1
officers may still examine the physical aspects of a cell phone to ensure that it will not be used as a weapon -- which is a definite possibility due to modern criminal ingenuity			1
but the @entity1 has now announced that absent certain urgent circumstances , the actual data on a phone is never physically dangerous			2
you ca n't throw an emoji at anyone , or stab someone with a @entity180			1
citizens enjoy more substantial privacy interests when digital data is involved , says the court			0
the @entity1 ruling in the @entity125 case says @entity2 jurisprudence has " recognized that the @entity19 was the founding generation 's response to the reviled ' general warrants ' and ' writs of assistance ' of the colonial era , which allowed @entity193 officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity			1
opposition to such searches was in fact one of the driving forces behind the revolution itself			0

@entity1 unanimously rules that cops ca n't search a cell phone without a warrant
@entity209 says people should pay more attention to @entity19 cases
he says phones can still be checked to make sure they 're not being used as weapons
@entity209 : @entity1 affirms @entity19 passed to limit ability of law *enforcement* to search
