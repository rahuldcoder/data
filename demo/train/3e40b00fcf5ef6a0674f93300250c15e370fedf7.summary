@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 state health and fisheries officials and leaders from several federal agencies will collaborate to set safety levels for seafood coming out of the @entity5 , vice president @entity3 said tuesday			1
" we want one single standard so you do n't have to worry about where you fish , when you can fish , " @entity3 said			1
" bottom line is , we want to get fishermen back out on the water as soon as possible after the oil has been removed			2
" the plan will be devised and carried out in collaboration with the @entity21 and the @entity22 , he said			2
representatives from @entity22 , the @entity21 and the @entity24 met last week in @entity0 with state health officers and state fisheries directors from @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity1 , @entity29 and @entity30 to fine - tune the plan for sampling state and federal waters and deciding when to reopen them			1
" together , they will implement a comprehensive , coordinated , multi-agency program to ensure that seafood from the @entity5 is safe to eat , " @entity22 and the @entity21 said in a joint news release			1
" this is important not only for consumers who need to know their food is safe to eat , but also for fishermen who need to be able to sell their products with confidence			2
" " no single agency could adequately ensure the safety of seafood coming from the @entity5 following this tragedy , but in working together , we can be sure that tainted waters are closed as appropriate , contaminated seafood is not allowed to make it to market , and that closed waters can be reopened to fishing as soon as is safe , " said @entity44 , @entity22 assistant administrator for fisheries , in the release			1
@entity22 said it was applying the protocol in considering whether to reopen two areas off @entity1 and @entity28			1
the release also quoted @entity61 , @entity21 deputy commissioner for foods , saying , " we understand the devastating effects this spill has had on the @entity65 and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with state and federal partners to ensure that these important protocols are implemented efficiently , effectively and in a way that makes sense for all involved , while maintaining the no. 1 priority we all share -- protecting the health of those in the @entity65 and across the country			2
" @entity22 and @entity21 are also testing fish caught outside closed areas to see whether they contain petroleum compounds , the release said			2
" so far , fish flesh tested from outside the closure areas have tested well below any level of concern for oil - based contamination , " it said			2
@entity3 made his announcement after touring the operations center in @entity0			1
" i just came to say thanks , " the vice president told staffers at the center			1
you 're probably missing out on vacation			0
my mother would say , ' @entity98 love you			0
' " @entity3 later flew to @entity100 in the @entity101 , where he sought to reassure @entity65 residents of the government 's long - term commitment to recovery efforts in the area			1
" we ... intend to stick with this region until it is made whole so we can repair the economy and rebuild the ecosystem and restart a way of life from @entity1 to here , " @entity3 said			1
he was scheduled to continue on to @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity28 , for dinner with gen. @entity118 and his wife at their home			1
@entity3 's visit came on the 71st day of the spill that president @entity124 has called the nation 's worst environmental disaster			1
his comments also came as officials prepared to close @entity129 , the main entry from the @entity5 into @entity131 , because of an approaching six - square - mile patch of " dark red tar mats " ranging in size from 6 feet to 10 feet across , according to @entity136 spokeswoman @entity135			1
the pass will reopen wednesday with the outgoing tide , said @entity139 , who added that the pass has been closed in the past to other oil incidents			0
@entity139 also noted that tar mats are easier to corral while still in the water			1
@entity144 said tuesday it is on track to reach its august deadline of getting a relief well down to the area where the oil is leaking in the @entity5			1
the relief well has reached a depth of 16,770 feet , but engineers plan to drill an additional 900 feet vertically before cutting in sideways , said @entity155 , @entity144 senior vice president of exploration and production			1
meanwhile , efforts continue to increase the containment of leaking oil			0
the next step is to bring in a third rig called the @entity162 at the well , which would increase the containment by 20,000 to 25,000 more barrels per day , @entity155 said			0
but the arrival , originally planned for tuesday , was delayed until perhaps july 6 or 7 by rough seas , said @entity167 , a spokesman for @entity144			0
the work of two other vessels , the @entity170 and the @entity171 , was continuing without interruption , he said			0
the use of skimmers , which require calm seas to be effective , was suspended monday and tuesday , he said			0
but the use of dispersants continued , with a total to date of nearly 1.6 million gallons recovered , he said			0
@entity144 spokesman @entity179 said that surface burning of oil and the placing of additional booms also were suspended in the choppy 5 - to 7 - foot seas			0
@entity185 was approaching hurricane strength tuesday evening and was located off the coast of @entity189 's @entity188 in the @entity190			0
at 5 p.m. et , it was moving to the northwest at about 13 mph , the @entity191 said , but was headed away from the area affected by the oil spill			0
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels ( about 1.5 million gallons ) and 60,000 barrels ( about 2.5 million gallons ) of oil are gushing into the gulf every day			0
but even with @entity144 feverishly trying to contain it , more and more oil seems to wash up on the coasts of some @entity65			0
@entity201 , the mayor of @entity202 , @entity29 , said she was going to have to close a beach in her town tuesday			2
" what we 're seeing actually is minimal tar balls anywhere from a penny to half - a - dollar size			2
they are tacky , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity211 , april @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
