@entity0 -- the screen is black and white			0
a little girl , no taller than the weeds that surround her , stands in a field and picks petals from a delicate daisy			2
she quietly counts each one			0
suddenly an ominous voice can be heard counting down from 10			0
she looks up as the camera zooms in on her face , all the way into her iris			0
and then the unthinkable happens : a mushroom cloud			0
sunday marked the 50th anniversary of the famous " @entity17 " ad run by @entity19 's 1964 presidential campaign			1
the aim of the one - minute spot , widely known as the first political attack ad , was to frame @entity24 @entity23 as a warmonger			1
" no one had attacked anyone like that before , " said @entity26 , a @entity27 professor who literally wrote the book about the @entity17			1
" it was a pretty strong , implicit charge -- that my opponent is a reckless cowboy who will destroy your children in a nuclear holocaust			2
" the end of the spot , which never even mentions @entity23 or shows his image , encourages viewers to vote for @entity19			1
it aired only once , during an @entity43 broadcast of the film " @entity45 , " as part of the network 's popular " monday night at the movies			1
" an estimated 50 million viewers were watching , not a bad return on the $ 25,000 spent by @entity19 's campaign			1
the ' @entity17 ' spot and five other compelling political ads while advertising for everyday products such as cleaning supplies had already shifted into a creative realm by that point , political advertising was still intellectually based , @entity26 noted			1
it was heavy on facts , light on ethos			0
" it was sort of seen as unseemly to advertise a politician like a bar of soap , " said @entity26 , the author of " @entity64 and @entity65			0
" capitalizing on emotions but the advertising giant responsible for the @entity19 ad , @entity71 , understood what made people buy things -- and ideas			1
" you ca n't give people enough facts to fall in love with you , you got to move them to fall in love with you , " @entity26 said			0
" the only way to do that is to make it emotional			0
" and one of the most prevalent emotions in september 1964 , less than two years after the @entity85 , was fear			2
@entity90 fighter featured in @entity24 campaign ad @entity23 had listed the use of small nuclear weapons as a possible way to defoliate parts of the @entity97 jungle and destroy key infrastructure used by communist guerrillas			1
he tried backing away from those comments , saying he was n't necessarily advocating such tactics			0
but @entity103 had already seized on the language to help drive part of their narrative against the candidate			0
" it was almost like a crusade not to have @entity23 become president , " said @entity109 , the creative director at @entity110 at the time who helped make the ad			1
" we just did what we usually do : we take a product , we tell the truth about it in an unusual way			0
" and @entity24 fought back , protesting over what they considered a grossly misleading attack against @entity23			1
that in part helped spurred media coverage for the rest of the week , with all three news networks airing the ad			2
experts say it was the first example of a political spot becoming a news event			1
" it was a commercial that went viral before there was a ' viral , ' " said @entity137 , an advertising creative director who teaches political ads at @entity139			2
an ad is born so how did they come up with the idea ? the firm was hired by the @entity144 to work on a series of 27 anti-goldwater ads , five of which focused on nuclear warfare			2
@entity109 , now 82 , said he was listening to soundtracks of children with sound engineer @entity152 , another mastermind behind the @entity17 , and they came across sound of a child counting from one to 10			2
" we decided that would be a great symbol to use , " he recalled			0
" that symbol of a child counting , then a voice of doom melding into the child 's voice -- a great symbol to show that this is what could happen to a child			2
" @entity109 said he was inspired by a 1954 @entity169 film , " the @entity170 , " by director @entity171			0
to show that a child had died in the movie , the director froze the shot on the child and zoomed into the child 's face			2
the @entity17 ad was actually shot in a residential field in @entity179 , he said , adding that it took about two hours and 15 to 20 takes to get the shot they wanted from the little girl , child actress @entity184			1
big spending group goes up again in 2014 ad wars now 53 , @entity187 said she barely recalls anything from the shoot			2
she was about 3 and only remembers her mother taking her to a daisy field			0
her parents -- one a fan of @entity23 and the other of @entity19 -- had no idea their daughter would be featured in a political spot			1
" and so when it aired , i remembered them saying ' oh my gosh			0
it 's a political ad for @entity19 ! ' " she said			1
" and then there was all the backlash			0
i remember my grandmother speaking about it and being concerned that it was so harsh			0
" @entity208 push called ' un-american ' in new ad when @entity187 moved to @entity211 -- home of the @entity23 's department store -- about 20 years after the ad , she warily avoided the chain , worried she might be found out			1
" my grandmother had instilled this fear in me that i should n't comment to people that i 'm the @entity17 because , you know , it was n't necessarily a good thing that i was in that ad , " she said			1
because the spot aired only once and @entity187 was a toddler at the time , she never saw the full thing until 2000 , when she was in a technical college course and her professor asked the class to look up videos online			1
@entity187 admitted she 's not a fan of all the attention the ad has brought over the past 50 years , nor does she feel " completely proud " that the commercial set a precedent for what 's become five decades of increasingly negative political ads. " i do n't really like that part of it , " she said			1
" but , you know , it 's part of my life and part of my history			0
" @entity242 is front and center in @entity246 ad			0

@entity19 's campaign aired the " @entity17 " ad on september 7 , 1964
the *controversial* ad targeted his opponent , @entity24 @entity23
experts say the spot , considered the first political attack ad , changed politics
@entity184 , the girl who *starred* in the ad , never saw the full thing until 2000
