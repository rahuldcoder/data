the blizzard of 2015 is n't done yet			0
while sparing much of @entity2 and @entity3 , the much talked - about storm managed to wallop parts of @entity6 on tuesday			1
and even after producing coastal flooding and dropping several feet of snow ( including 30 inches in @entity10 , @entity11 , and up to 6 - foot drifts statewide ) , there 's more to come			1
" we fully expect that there are parts of eastern and central @entity11 where people may get ... another 5 to 10 inches of snow , " gov. @entity12 said around midday			1
" ... and there are areas around eastern @entity11 , at this point , that you would probably describe as being in a whiteout - type condition			1
" @entity11 was n't the only state getting hit hard tuesday afternoon			1
the @entity24 has also reported about 16 inches of snow in @entity26 , @entity27 ; over 21 inches in @entity28 , @entity29 ; and 28Â½ inches in @entity30 on @entity2 's @entity31			1
it 's not just the snow			1
east - facing coastal areas -- already coping with early morning flooding , heavy snow and potent winds -- are bracing for a new high tide and the storm surge expected with it around 5 p.m. @entity40 and its 15,000 residents " lost power to the entire island , " said police chief @entity42 , a situation he attributed to sustained winds of roughly 50 mph , punctuated by gusts of around 80 mph			1
@entity48 had restored electricity , using generators , to most of them by noon , state emergency management director @entity52 said , though a more permanent solution was still probably a day away			1
on @entity11 ' @entity55 , the ocean roared inland to flood the @entity56 lined with homes and businesses			1
the town 's police department posted a photo of what it called a " major seawall breach ( that ) caused structural damage " to an unoccupied home , while authorities in neighboring @entity66 showed a deck blown yards away from a home			1
and not far away in @entity71 , slushy ice , seawater and debris clogged streets			0
" and they 're talking about another wave ( of snow ) , " said @entity76 , a state representative for both @entity77 and @entity71			1
on the northern edge of the storm in @entity27 , @entity82 resident @entity81 said at 1 p.m. that up to 15 inches of snow was already on the ground , and " we 're expected to get another 10 inches			1
" so what can you do in the meantime , besides pray that the power stays on ? " it 's just go out and clean up a little bit so you can , " said @entity92 , a @entity1 ireporter			1
" then wait a few hours and do it again			0
" the good news ? most people seemed to have heeded the warnings about the storm , which was forecast as " crippling " and " potentially historic , " by stocking up and staying off the roads			0
if you go through this every year , after all , there 's a good chance you 'll know the drill			2
" during these storms , everybody has to hunker down and just be safe , " said @entity107 from @entity108 , on @entity11 ' @entity109			1
" we 've become pretty proficient at that			0
" while residents of @entity116 and @entity11 battled tuesday 's storm , others in the @entity119 -- namely people in @entity2 and @entity3 -- were breathing a sigh of relief			1
compare that with a day earlier , when they 'd have been more likely to be hyperventilating , given the all but cataclysmic warnings about the coming storm			0
they were told it could turn 58 million people 's lives upside down			2
seven states , from @entity3 to @entity29 , declared states of emergency			0
@entity134 was called off for not just tuesday but wednesday as well			0
businesses closed , suggesting a far - reaching economic impact in one of @entity140 's busiest commercial regions			1
yet by mid-morning , snow was n't even falling in @entity2			1
by then , travel bans in @entity3 and @entity2 -- even places like @entity31 's @entity144 , which got more than 20 inches of snow -- had been lifted , as some restrictions remained in effect in neighboring @entity148			1
@entity2 mayor @entity149 called all the warning and preparations " a better safe than sorry scenario			1
" " we 've dodged the bullet , " he told @entity1			0
" this is nothing like we feared it would be			2
" the forecast even improved for @entity158			0
once expected to see up to 30 inches of snow , the prediction for the @entity11 capital was downgraded to 15 to 25 inches early tuesday			1
still , 2 feet of snow is n't anything to scoff at			2
just ask all those who had their cars snowed in , their front doors blocked and their backyards littered with branches tuesday			0
" the worst part is the steady winds , i think they were approaching 50 mph , " said @entity42 , @entity40 's police chief			2
the storm has also proved dangerous			0
a 17 - year - old died after he hit something while snow - tubing monday night in @entity177 , @entity2 , @entity179 's @entity178 said			1
and an 83 - year - old man who suffered from dementia was found frozen to death in his backyard in the same @entity31 county , he added			0
in @entity77 , @entity11 , there are worries that homes and businesses along the coast could experience significant damage due to the deteriorating seawall			1
" if you do n't have that line of defense , then you could have severe damage and homes that will fall into the ocean , " said @entity76			2
" without the seawall , you 'd have tremendous erosion			0
" even @entity6 who live further inland are n't out of the woods yet			0
@entity202 , @entity11 , had 25 inches around midday tuesday , with another 6 inches expected as the afternoon rolled on , mayor @entity201 said			1
crews are already trying to clear streets , but it 's not easy			2
" the biggest problem we have now is the winds putting the snow back on the streets after we plow them , " @entity201 told @entity1			2
" we have about 35 - to 50 - mph winds , which are supposed to slow down as well			0
" yet , as @entity213 mayor @entity212 points out , local authorities ca n't let up -- not if they want life to go back to normal anytime soon			2
" we do n't have an option			0
when it snows , we have to clear the streets , " he said			0
and if you 're trying to escape this wintry mess , do n't count on it			0
@entity222 crawled on everything from side roads to highways -- including the @entity226 , which was closed to traffic as of early tuesday afternoon -- and many public transit systems shut down			0
@entity229 was also affected , suspending @entity230 and @entity232 services between @entity2 and @entity158 for tuesday because of the weather			1
flying out was n't an option due to the combination of stiff winds , heavy snows and ice			0
what to know if you 're traveling more than 4,700 flights in and out of the @entity140 had already been canceled as of 2:15 p.m. tuesday , the flight - tracking website @entity242 reported			2
that 's on top of 2,800 scrubbed monday			2
hundreds more have already been called off for wednesday			0
some airports turned into makeshift shelters , whether folks liked it or not			0
a @entity253 @entity2 - to - @entity252 flight was delayed for roughly 6 hours monday due to an ill passenger , bad weather , mechanical problems and other issues			1
by the time the flight was finally canceled around midnight , roads were closed and passengers had to stay at @entity2 's @entity261 airport overnight , according to the airline			1
by early tuesday afternoon , incoming flights began arriving again at @entity2 's @entity260			1
@entity264 tweeted that it would have a limited number of flights landing at @entity261 and @entity267 in nearby northern @entity3 as well			2
the storm warnings seemed to impress even the most jaded @entity269 , as groceries flew off store shelves from @entity272 to @entity273			0
still , it 's not like everyone was shaking in their snow boots			1
as @entity280 , a retired meteorologist who lives in @entity281 , @entity11 , said , " we 've done it before			1
" and the coastal city of @entity283 , @entity29 , could soon be shaking for a different reason			2
hundreds have accepted an invitation , via @entity287 , to a massive community snowball fight -- one that organizer @entity289 joked is in the proud tradition dating back to around 1624 , when the city was first settled			2
@entity289 said parents have asked if their kids are welcome			0
they are , he said , and the snow should be light and less dangerous			2
some of the bars in the small , close - knit @entity6 community will be open to cater to the snowball fight warriors			0
@entity289 called the response tremendous , especially compared with what he got the last two times he tried to organize such an event			0
" at this point , it 's just going to be fun , " he said			0
fresh off snowblowing his driveway , @entity304 estimated about 2 feet of light , fluffy snow had fallen outside his home in @entity309 , @entity29			0
that 's hardly a dusting , but it 's also not surprising when you live in @entity6			0
" sure , that 's a lot , but i have tons of family in @entity317 and they were dealing with 6 - 10 feet of ( snow ) at the start of the season , " @entity304 said			1
" ... we will weather this like the @entity6 we are			0
" @entity1 's @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report .			0

flights begin arriving again at @entity2 's @entity260 airport
@entity11 *governor* : 5 to 10 inches more snow could fall in parts of state
" this is nothing like we feared it would be , " @entity2 's mayor says of the impact on his city
