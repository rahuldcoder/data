as national democrats are jumping at the chance to sink rep. @entity4 , @entity1 @entity0 are throwing the @entity6 majority whip a buoy			1
@entity0 from the @entity8 , including a current congressman and two former statewide elected officials , are giving @entity4 some much needed cover after his position in the @entity14 leadership was suddenly thrown up in the air monday when his office confirmed an eyebrow - raising speech he gave to a @entity20 - founded white supremacist group in 2002			1
former @entity22 senator @entity21 , a @entity23 who beat back a challenge from @entity25 in 1990 , said even he did n't know that @entity26 as " a racist organization			2
" " i may disagree with @entity28 but a racist he is not			0
nor would he have been stupid enough to knowingly address a racist group , " @entity21 said in a statement published in the @entity30			0
" while it is sometimes fun to see @entity14 in trouble , you 'd be wrong to blame representative @entity4 for being racist on account of addressing a ( @entity26 ) meeting			2
" @entity21 is now a lobbyist in @entity37 and a strong supporter of oil and gas drilling in the @entity40			0

earlier in the week , rep. @entity56 , who will be the only @entity1 @entity23 left on @entity57 next week , fended off attacks against @entity4 leveled by @entity60 officials in @entity37			1
" i am not going to let them use @entity4 as a scapegoat to score political points when i know him and know his family , " @entity56 , who is @entity61 , told the @entity30 on monday night			1
" i do n't think @entity4 has a racist bone in his body			1
" but the support from those stateside @entity0 has n't pushed democrats in @entity37 from calling off the hounds			1

" one of the many groups that i spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views i wholeheartedly condemn , " @entity4 said tuesday in a statement			0
" i am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain			0
" among other @entity60 spokesman in @entity37 , @entity93 national press secretary @entity92 said the revelation about @entity4 made it " clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti-semitic , racist hate groups			2
" " @entity4 chose to cheerlead for a group of @entity76 members and neo-nazis at a white supremacist rally and now his fellow @entity104 ca n't even speak up and say he was wrong			2
while @entity20 defends @entity4 , @entity105 and @entity106 are refusing to condemn @entity4 's choice of allies , " @entity92 said			0
