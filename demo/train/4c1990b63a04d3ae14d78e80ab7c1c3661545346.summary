a mirror that @entity1 looked into as he dressed in his final months and onto which he scribbled a message to himself sold for $ 18,750 at auction in @entity5 this weekend			1
@entity6 sold 524 items that furnished the 100 @entity9 mansion in @entity12 ' @entity11 neighborhood , significant because it was where @entity1 and his three children lived in the months before his death			1
@entity1 did not own the furnishings			2
some items brought higher prices because of their infamy in crime scene photos shown in this year 's trial of @entity1 's doctor , @entity22 , but others were valuable because @entity1 and his family left their mark on them			1
a chalkboard may have cost a few hundred dollars , but it sold for $ 5,000 because of what his children wrote on it			1
the note , handwritten on the black board attached to a 26 - inch - tall ceramic rooster , reads " love @entity34 / i ( heart ) @entity34 / smile it 's for free			0
" it sat in the kitchen where @entity1 would eat lunch each day with @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
it was not known which child wrote the chalk note , but @entity48 's executive director @entity47 said his research suggested it was from @entity42 , who was 11 when her father died			0
the mirror with a message is on a @entity56 - revival - style armoire from @entity1 's master bedroom , presumably where @entity1 looked each day as he dressed			1
he used a wax pencil to remind himself : " train , perfection march april full out may			0
" the note is significant , considering that @entity1 was battling the calendar as he prepared for his " @entity64 " concerts set to premiere in @entity63 in july 2009			2
dr. @entity22 's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on @entity1 to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep , which led to @entity22 administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life			2
@entity22 was sentenced last month to four years in the @entity74 jail for involuntary manslaughter in @entity1 's june 25 , 2009 death			1
other items were macabre , not inspirational			0
a small table that sat next to the bed where @entity1 spent his last living hours in a desperate search for sleep sold for $ 5,000			1
the " @entity84 occasional table " was listed for between $ 300 and $ 500			0
it was a centerpiece of several key crime scene photos at @entity22 's trial , because several bottles of sedatives were found on it			0
the oriental rug on which paramedics tried to revive @entity1 sold for $ 15,360 , although the auction catalog placed its value at between $ 400 and $ 600			1
it , also , is prominent on photos shown at the trial			0
@entity48 's backed away from selling the bed in which @entity1 received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother , @entity103 , @entity47 said			2
the auction house 's re-creation of the bedroom where @entity1 died -- euphemistically called " the medicine room " by the company -- features a bed - sized memorial covered with love notes from @entity1 fans instead of the death bed			1
the most expensive items sold were a $ 35,200 watercolor painting of floral still life by @entity116 and a $ 46,875 oil painting of fishing village by @entity119			0
@entity1 's relationship with @entity48 's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his neverland ranch			1
the singer sued the auction company , claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from @entity125 after he sold the ranch			0
the suit was settled in april 2009 when @entity48 's canceled the auction and later returned the items to @entity1 .			2

a chalkboard with a message of love from @entity1 's children sells for $ 5,000
the rug on which paramedics tried to revive @entity1 sells for $ 15,360
@entity1 did *n't* own the furnishings , but his use of them should raise prices
