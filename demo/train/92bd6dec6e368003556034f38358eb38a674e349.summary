a lethal combination of worn aircraft parts and unprecedented speed caused last year 's @entity4 crash , which killed a veteran pilot and 10 spectators , and injured more than 60 others , federal accident investigators concluded monday			1
the main culprits , according to the @entity10 , were several lock nuts on the left trim tab -- an aerodynamic surface on the horizontal part of the plane 's tail -- nuts that had not been replaced in at least 26 years			2
the worn nuts allowed screws to loosen -- possibly years ago , without apparent consequence , the @entity10 said			2
but when pilot @entity22 pushed the highly modified @entity23 to a speed of 445 knots -- 35 knots faster than it had ever flown before on the @entity27 race course -- the flaw caused flutter vibrations in the plane 's trim tabs			1
the plane pitched up at about 17 gs of acceleration , incapacitating @entity22			0
@entity4 air race organizers hope to continue race after deadly crash the plane rolled , plunged towards the ground and slammed into a box seating area , showering the area with debris			1
when the incident happened last september , it threatened to bring an end to the @entity4 in @entity4 , the only race of its kind in the nation			2
but organizers have compiled a complete schedule of races from september 12 through 16 , saying they have made numerous safety improvements recommended by the @entity10			2
among the improvements : race planes will be required to demonstrate their airworthiness at racing speeds before participating in races , spectators will be seated further from the aerial race course and the @entity4 has " flattened " the tight turn where last year 's accident occurred			1
" pilots know that they are taking risks , but air race pilots expect that the risks taken are theirs alone , " said @entity10 chairman @entity61			1
" the spectators assumed that their safety had been assessed and addressed			1
" @entity61 said the @entity10 made its recommendations in april to give the @entity68 time to implement the changes for this year 's race			1
the @entity10 said major modifications to the aircraft , intended to make the plane faster , contributed to the accident			0
its 37 - foot wingspan had been reduced to 29 feet			0
some of the changes were undocumented and had a detrimental effect on the @entity79 - era aircraft , which was known as " @entity80			0
" for instance , investigators said , the plane 's right trim tab -- a piece of the tail -- was locked in position aligned with the tail			0
pilot overwhelmed by g - forces in @entity4 crash " on this airplane , you should have both trim tabs , " investigators said			1
" this pilot put a screw through there to fix it in position , and when you do that , he lost redundancy			0
you have put all the eggs in the basket of hoping the left elevator will not fail			0
" @entity22 's age , 74 , was not found to be a factor in the crash			0
the 17 g forces that resulted from the failure greatly exceeded human tolerances , the @entity10 said			0
it is difficult for trained pilots to remain conscious with even @entity113 , the @entity10 has said			2
the accident investigation was greatly aided by numerous movies and photographs by spectators , according to the @entity10			2
since the accident , several victims and family members have filed suit , one alleging that the crash was not a " freak accident , " but was " the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk taking pilot and crew , coupled with an insatiable drive for profit " by race organizers			1
the @entity4 racing association , meanwhile , announced last week it has set up a $ 77 million fund to compensate victims or heirs			0
the program is being administered by @entity138 who administered funds for victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the @entity143 disaster			0
the @entity4 crash focused attention on the dangers of air races and air shows			1
in addition to the 11 people killed at the @entity4 races , five performers died at air shows elsewhere last year			1
federal regulators and air show organizers vouch for the safety of the system , saying rules for @entity159 air shows are stricter than those in other countries			0
@entity10 focuses on deadly year in air races , shows			1

a veteran pilot and 10 spectators died in last year 's @entity4 crash
the @entity10 finds that worn parts and speed caused the crash
" air race pilots expect that the risks taken are theirs alone , " @entity10 head says
" the spectators assumed that their safety had been assessed and addressed "
