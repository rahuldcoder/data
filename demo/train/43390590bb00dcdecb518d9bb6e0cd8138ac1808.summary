-- @entity1 remembers growing up on the @entity3 island of @entity4 , the world 's smallest independent republic			2
" the weather patterns were predictable , " he says			2
" there was a wet season and a dry season , an annual cycle			2
when there was drought , it was limited			2
" " now it 's different , " he tells @entity0			2
" there 's no predictability -- periods of drought can last seven or eight years , and when we get storms they are more intense			1
the coastline is being eroded			0
now the sea is right up to people 's doorsteps			1
" @entity26 is now foreign minister of @entity4 , and leads the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) at the current @entity29 conference in @entity30 , @entity31			1
the @entity27 is fighting a @entity34 - and - @entity33 battle with the world 's biggest polluters -- trying to shame them into tougher action to limit emissions and curb the warming of the planet			1

and they accuse the likes of @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50 of not addressing climate change with enough urgency			1
the @entity53 said in 2007 that sea levels would rise between seven and 23 inches ( 18 and 59 centimeters ) this century , but a rate of ice - melt in the @entity57 that is much faster than anticipated has prompted many scientists to raise the projection to about one meter , more than three feet			1
among those most threatened are the @entity61 , halfway between @entity62 and @entity63			0
the highest point on the 29 atolls and five islands is 33 feet ( 10 meters ) above sea level			1
the capital , @entity69 , is just three feet above sea level and was inundated by high tides four years ago			1

in @entity4 , too , people do n't have many places to go			0
the island -- which on satellite imagery looks like a white pebble in the deep blue expanse of the @entity3 -- is eight square miles ( 21 square kilometers ) and has a population of some 10,000 , almost all of whom live on the coastline			0
the highest point is 200 feet above sea level , but much of the interior has been ravaged by the effects of phosphate mining			2
and the nearest neighbors are some 180 miles ( almost 300 kilometers ) away			0
@entity26 says the @entity27 wants the 190 - odd delegations in @entity30 to " ramp up their ambitions " because current scientific projections about the warming planet will otherwise wipe out a number of low - lying states			1
the @entity99 , the only binding international agreement on emissions , expires in less than four weeks			0
and the @entity30 conference is due to end later this week			2
read more : greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011 " some countries are ready to sign up for a second commitment period to @entity106 , " which would last from 2013 to 2020 , @entity26 says			0
among them the @entity107 and @entity108			0
but @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 are among governments that have already said they wo n't sign onto an extension of @entity106 , a stance that @entity26 says is " very disappointing			0
" they are demanding that countries like @entity49 and @entity48 -- now the first and third emitters of greenhouse gases -- to be bound by new targets , along with the industrialized world			0
@entity49 and @entity48 , as developing nations , were excused from the commitment adopted at @entity106 by some 40 developed nations to cut their carbon emissions by 5 % by this year , compared with the level in 1990			0
measuring sea levels among the @entity128 -- and trying to establish trends -- is complicated by the effects of the weather systems known as @entity132 and @entity133 , according to climatologists			1
but beyond the threat of higher sea levels , the warming climate produces more extreme storms , and more acidic water bleaches coral reefs			1
then there are the fish			0
many of these island states rely on fishing to survive and as a source of revenue , but as ocean temperatures warm , fish move			2
tuna do n't like it hot and swim toward cooler , nutrient - rich waters			0
a paper prepared this year by the @entity153 forecasts that currents and changes in water temperature will mean that " tuna are likely to move progressively toward the east " -- away from the islands of @entity160			0
" traditional food sources and ways of living will be at risk , " @entity26 says			0
@entity27 is asking @entity29 officials at @entity30 not to allow this conference -- the 17th since the @entity99 was adopted in 1997 -- to degenerate into a last - minute take - it - or - leave - it declaration , as have previous sessions of the @entity170 on @entity171			1
but these conferences have a habit of coming to life only when the main players turn up in the final days , and past meetings have led to shallow agreements that revised the process of negotiation rather than established real commitments			0
whether @entity30 will be much different , and whether @entity26 and his colleagues from the @entity27 will see a glimpse of hope on the horizon , may become clearer by the end of this week			1
at present they do n't sound very optimistic , releasing a statement monday that reads : " we begin the final week of negotiations in @entity30 with the sober recognition that time is running out to prevent the loss of entire nations and other calamities in our membership and around the world			1

lands in the @entity27 are disappearing amid rising sea levels
the @entity27 is pressing for action at the current @entity171 conference
the warming climate also produces more extreme storms and affects fishing
@entity27 members do not sound optimistic about the conference
