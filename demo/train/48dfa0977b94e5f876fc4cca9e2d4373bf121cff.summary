@entity0 , @entity1 -- former prime minister @entity6 's @entity5 won a landslide victory in @entity1 's first national elections in seven years , claiming nearly 230 of the 300 seats in parliament , the country 's electoral commission reported			1
supporters of @entity1 's @entity12 celebrate in @entity0 on monday			2
with 295 contests decided , the @entity5 had won 228 seats , giving it far more than the two - thirds majority needed to change the country 's constitution , the commission reported			1
the league 's closest rival , the @entity21 , won 27 seats , with one seat to be contested later			1
the results are an overwhelming win for @entity6 over her longtime archrival , the @entity21 's @entity27 , in the first vote since an army - backed caretaker government took power in 2006			1
the rivalry between the two former prime ministers runs so deep that they are known in the country as the " battling begums , " for an honorific given to women of rank in the country			2
monday 's balloting went off peacefully , except for a few isolated incidents of skirmishes and people complaining of not finding their names on voter rolls			1
@entity46 , executive director of the human rights group @entity48 , told @entity2 that the turnout was close to 70 percent			0
" on one hand , it was sending a clear message that the people of @entity1 believe in democracy , " @entity46 said			0
" but on the other hand it 's also that they are looking for a sweeping change in the country			0
" he said anti-incumbent sentiment appeared to damage the @entity21 , which was in power for the five years before a 2006 state of emergency that was lifted only weeks ago			1
" what was surprising was the kind of scale of the change , " he said			0
political analysts say the true test of whether democracy can flourish in this @entity70 - majority nation of 150 million people begins now			1
after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the @entity21 handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution			1
but the @entity5 refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government , and @entity6 accused @entity81 of stocking it with @entity21 backers			1
supporters of both sides took to the streets in months of deadly clashes			0
to stem the tide of violence , a military - backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency , banning political events and postponing elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft - ridden politics			1
@entity81 served a term as prime minister in 1991 , @entity6 in 1996 and @entity81 once again in 2001			0
as one took office , the other led strikes and street protests that kept the @entity70 - majority country of 150 million people politically unstable and financially radioactive to international investors			2
both face allegations of corruption , which each have dismissed as politically motivated			0
and @entity6 was forced to curtail her campaign activities , relying on videoconferencing to address crowds as police investigated a report by @entity115 that a fundamentalist @entity70 group had dispatched a six - member suicide squad to assassinate her			2
the group , @entity119 is banned in @entity1			0
@entity6 survived a prior attempt on her life in 2004 when extremists threw grenades at a rally , killing 20 and wounding hundreds			0
past elections in @entity1 have been marred by widespread instances of ballot box - stuffing and voter intimidation			2
to prevent a similar outcome this go - around , the election commission took unprecedented steps -- deploying 600,000 troops to maintain security and thousands of local and international observers to monitor the polls and issuing voter identification cards to 81 million eligible voters			1
the caretaker government that took power in 2006 adopted emergency powers that allowed authorities to arrest a person without a court warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was related to a crime , said the @entity151 - based group , @entity152			1
a wave of detentions followed , and residents rejoiced at the drop in crime			0
by some estimates , more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged			0
the state of emergency was lifted on december 17 , leaving politicians less than two weeks to campaign			0
among those arrested in the interim were more than 150 top politicians , including @entity6 -- charged with taking bribes -- and @entity81 -- facing charges of graft of improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract			2
@entity2 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
