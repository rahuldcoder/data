@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government has lost control over five provinces , and security in the country is deteriorating , the nation 's acting president told @entity2 in an exclusive interview wednesday			1
in his first interview with a @entity14 tv network , vice president @entity11 detailed how @entity16 drones are using voice recognition to target @entity19 leaders and help the government win back control			1
@entity11 has been @entity1 's acting president since june 3 , when president @entity21 was wounded in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace			1
during wednesday 's hour - long meeting , @entity11 said @entity21 's wounds from what he described as an assassination attempt were so severe that he has no idea when the president will return from medical treatment in @entity32			1
@entity11 said he saw @entity21 immediately after the bomb attack			1
the 68 - year - old ruler 's chest had been pierce by a piece of wood and his face , arms and upper body had been burned , @entity11 said			2
but , he added , the president 's health was improving daily			2
the interview in the sprawling and heavily defended defense ministry underlined the many challenges facing the vice president , who many in the opposition consider to be a weak placeholder until the president returns from @entity32			1
he acknowledges that his house is surrounded by opposing forces , but he challenges claims that he is unable to use the presidential palace			0
@entity11 says he calls @entity21 's son , commander of the powerful @entity57 at the palace , whenever he wants to give him orders			1
he countered opposition accusations that he has no power , saying he has been given full authority to sign a new , @entity64 - sponsored peace proposal			0
he outlined plans that are even less favorable to @entity21 's opponents than a @entity68 initiative he has already turned down			1
@entity11 said the new deal would have @entity21 stepping down only when a new president has been elected , a far cry from the @entity68 proposal that would have @entity21 handing power to @entity11 after 30 days with new elections within 60 days			1
at times , @entity11 -- who lived in @entity75 during the 1960s -- shifted uncomfortably in his seat , even joking at the end of the interview that he felt he 'd been through an interrogation			2
nevertheless , he gave a robust defense of @entity21 , challenging the widely held view that the embattled leader is now part of the problem , rather than part of the solution			2
@entity21 still has 3 million supporters , @entity11 said			2
" he is part of the political balance here in @entity1			2
he has been an expert in dealing with all differences , and with all political and tribal differences , " @entity11 said			2
when asked how @entity19 may have been taking advantage of deteriorating security , @entity11 said government forces were targeting them aggressively			1
he detailed an ongoing operation in the southern @entity100 province , where the capital recently fell to @entity19			0
he also gave an account of how @entity16 spy planes eavesdrop on @entity19 conversations , running voice recognition analysis that is shared with @entity1 authorities , the @entity106 and the @entity107 before targets are attacked			1
@entity11 said there are two types of drones			2
" one is taking pictures and collecting information , and the other one is carrying missiles			0
drones carrying missiles , actually these missiles could not be fired ... unless the voice of the enemy himself is recorded , " he said			0
often , he said , the @entity16 provides the targeting information and @entity1 military forces carry out the attacks			1
@entity11 offered few insights into how he plans to end @entity1 's spiraling economic hardships , growing fuel and power shortages and rising food prices -- issues that have sparked massive anti-government protests over the past several months and have worsened sharply since the president left for treatment in @entity32			1
but he said he expected @entity21 to make a speech to the nation in the coming hours that will help change the situation			0
and he said the @entity64 - sponsored peace proposal will create a new , parliamentary political system in @entity1 , " so it will wipe out or vanish any grievances , any complaints			0
" @entity21 went to @entity32 for treatment after doctors examined him shortly after the attack in early june			0
they recommended he get attention from specialists , including an eye doctor			0
since arriving there , he said , the president had been improving and fully intends to return			0
but when asked when that would be , he said he did not know			0
" it could be months			0
this is a decision up to the doctors			0
... i have no idea about the exact date when he is coming , " @entity11 said			0
in @entity159 , @entity158 adm. @entity157 said the chaos in @entity1 has been a source of concern to the @entity16 for years			1
" @entity19 , the federated group that 's in @entity1 , is an incredibly dangerous group that has taken full advantage of the chaos that has been in that country , " he told the @entity163			1
but , he added , the military can not provide the whole answer			0
" the security piece is a necessary condition , but it is insufficient in and of itself and it 's taken us a long time to figure that out			0

new : " there 's not a military answer anywhere , " says adm. @entity157
@entity1 's vice president says president @entity21 will return
