@entity0 -- it 's a highly secured , sophisticated research lab studying deadly diseases such as bird flu , monkeypox , tuberculosis and rabies			0
it 's in a facility called building 18 , which cost taxpayers $ 214 million			0
and now , the @entity13 lab at the @entity14 in @entity15 is also the subject of a congressional investigation after a potentially dangerous airflow leak at that lab , @entity1 has learned			1
the leak occurred on february 16 , when air flowed the wrong way out of a germ lab into a clean - air corridor , rather than through the powerful hepa filter that cleans the air , congressional sources and @entity14 officials said			1
visitors touring the facility were in the clean corridor when they observed a puff of air being pushed out from the lab through a slot in a door window			2
@entity1 recommends : deadly bird flu could become airborne if experiments had been under way at the time of that air leak , experts say , unprotected visitors could have been exposed to deadly germs , although an epidemic would have been unlikely			1
according to @entity47 rep. @entity46 , a @entity49 @entity48 and a medical doctor , the @entity45 has asked the @entity14 for documents about that incident			1
the request came in the wake of a report on internal @entity14 e-mails about the incident , first reported by @entity57 last week			2
" the biggest concern was that there was a contingent of visitors who were walking through the building , " @entity46 said			0
" and had one of those people been stricken or made ill or worse , obviously that would have been devastating			0
" the lab handles small mammals such as rats , ferrets and mice as part of its experiments with pathogens , according to @entity14 officials			1
they say animals were in the lab at the time of the air leak , but they were secured in filtered cages			1
@entity14 officials say the lab was clean , was not active at the time , and no one got infected			1
" at no time during recent incidents featured in the media were @entity14 workers or the public in harm 's way , " agency spokesman @entity84 said			1
" this unique facility features multiple security layers specifically designed to protect workers and the public in the event of an incident			1
" in a statement released to @entity1 , @entity46 ' committee said , " we will actively work to find out if there are additional concerns or incidents associated with @entity101			1
any anomaly or breach is of concern , and we will work to ensure the integrity of the facility is maintained and that our scientists are safe			0
" there has been at least one other safety - related incident in that same building where february 's air leak occurred			1
in 2008 , it was discovered that a high - containment lab door was sealed with duct tape			1
that incident was first reported by the @entity116 and confirmed to @entity1 by @entity84			0
@entity117 , former safety chief at the @entity118 , said the @entity14 has many safety layers in place at its labs			2
@entity117 says researchers at the @entity13 lab work in biosafety " cabinets " within the lab itself			0
" nothing is handled outside that cabinet , " @entity117 said			0
" so they 're working with minute amounts of material , and the chances of aerosol are negligible			0
" but there are questions about a possible cover - up			0
in an internal e-mail , reported by @entity57 , @entity14 biologist @entity137 said the centers " ... will do anything ... to hide the fact that we have serious problems with the airflow and containment in this whole building			2
" @entity1 has not been able to independently verify that e-mail			0
but in response , @entity84 said , " @entity14 will continue to take an open , transparent and inclusive approach to address any safety challenge in a manner that will ensure the safety of our workforce and the public			2
" @entity84 said the agency " intends to cooperate fully with rep. @entity46 and the committee to address any questions they may have about building 18 at @entity14			2
" @entity1 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0

a february air leak at a high - security @entity14 lab draws congressional *scrutiny*
the @entity14 says " at no time " were workers or the public in danger
a @entity45 panel wants to know whether there are " additional concerns or incidents "
