-- " why does it seem that the elections are only being held on @entity2 ? why is there no commotion on the streets yet ? where are the people ? " this is a question that a journalist based in @entity11 posted on his @entity2 account eight days before election day			1
@entity15 public opinion is deafeningly silent , a silence that even the media close to the regime has complained about			1
unlike the four previous presidential elections during which the streets were turned into lively and colorful carnivals with the supporters of different candidates engaging in unending debates and fervent speeches , this time it is only the walls of the streets that have been covered with banners and posters			1
but if this situation is sad it is also strange			2
domestic opinion polls and a few foreign ones -- such as the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) -- show that 60 % to 75 % of the people say they will participate in the elections			1
the same polls show that 60 % of these people have yet to decide which candidate to vote for			1
under such circumstances , one would expect individuals to come together in a public sphere and have ongoing and meaningful discussions so that people could hear different opinions			1
but this is not the case			2

less people are seen trying to persuade or convince one another ; therefore no political deliberation is taking place			2
it is as if this time it is not the public per se but individual observers who are deciding in their heads what to do on election day			1
contrary to what that journalist from @entity11 thought , compared to 2009 even online political engagement is less , colder and more indifferent			2
in 2009 , cyberspace was a battle scene for the campaigns of candidates -- particularly reformist candidates @entity78 and @entity79 , who are currently under house arrest			2
the @entity2 pages of these candidates had tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of likes and each post received hundreds of comments every day			2
one could easily see the accumulation of emotional energy in the interesting and untiring debates of @entity2 users , bloggers , and micro-bloggers			0
the supporters of the two reformist candidates tried to persuade those advocating banning the elections while at the same time engaged in passionate polemics over which one of their candidates was better			2
such a momentum was about to build up this year too			0
when former president @entity103 -- who is controversially considered the @entity106 regime 's godfather figure and also a democracy catalyst -- registered for candidacy one could see this built up energy begin to release			0

this indicates that the regime fears election campaigns more than the ballot boxes			0
@entity15 state television took measures to ensure that in the three rounds of televised election debates there would be the least amount of confrontation among the eight candidates , unlike in 2009			1
the first two debates were so boring that it drew criticism not only from the candidates themselves but also the presenters of the state tv			0
it was as if the soup had been served up too cold			0
but the third debate -- held on friday june 7 - suddenly became heated			1
not only did the reformist and " principalist " candidates [ who back the @entity148 ] attack each other but the principalist ones -- who were supposed to be in a coalition -- also went after one another			0
the candidates realized that even in the restrictive debate channels they could navigate and create waves			0
still , with every debate , social media became a place for individual posts full of mockery , sarcasm and personal revelations rather than showing affect for a certain candidate			2
while there are many pages dedicated to the eight presidential candidates on @entity2 -- none of which are official -- their energy level is low			0
the @entity2 pages of the two candidates close to the @entity173 are more active and have daily posts			0
but while commenting is allowed , there is a very short trace of vernacular voices under the posts			0
among the five so - called principalist candidates , @entity179 and @entity180 are the most active on social media websites			0
@entity180 supporters who are mostly young radical idealists associated with the cult known as @entity186 are digitally savvy enough			0
aside from a group of websites supporting him , a hub , which has identified more than 1,800 bloggers from all over @entity15 who advocate for @entity180 , has also been launched			1
if the reformist and @entity193 -- which was formed after the disputed 2009 elections -- supporters are present on @entity2 the principalist supporters of the regime have tried to " occupy " @entity199			2
this ironically shows that the digital attitude in @entity15 conforms with political orientation to some extent			1
what these two groups have in common is that they both access these websites with difficulty and using illegal anti-proxy software			0
but they have one main difference : principalist online activists monitor and follow their opponents but they are less being seen			0
read more : is @entity15 's next president the face of its nuclear program ? the popularity of social media and growing number of internet websites in @entity15 causes fewer individuals and groups to feel isolated or that they are in a minority			1
but the downside is that anyone can have the illusion that they are in the majority because they have less opportunity to step out of their ghetto and be exposed to opposition and contesting voices			0
the @entity15 regime is not that concerned about the ghettoization or fragmentation of public spheres			1
the experience of the past election has taught the regime that they must prevent the clash of these publics and their beliefs which could cause the election atmosphere to become antagonistic			0
this is why this year it was decided that the spring semester of universities would be finished sooner so that student bodies would not have the chance to have any election activity -- which even drew criticism from the pro-regime student bodies			0
using @entity255 's analogy , @entity15 's 2013 presidential election so far resembles drinking decaffeinated coffee , it tastes like coffee but you are not supposed to get a caffeine buzz from it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			1

@entity15 head to the polling *booths* on friday june 14
polls show that 60 % of voters are yet to decide which candidate to vote for
yet , @entity15 public opinion on the elections is ' deafeningly silent , ' *writes* @entity263
