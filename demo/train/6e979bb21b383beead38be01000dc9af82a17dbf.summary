@entity0 -- a piece believed to be from one of the airliners that hit the @entity7 towers on september 11 , 2001 , has been found behind the site of an @entity10 community center near ground zero , the @entity2 said friday			1
investigators are looking into how a part of what appears to be landing gear became wedged between 51 @entity16 -- the site of a controversial community center -- and another building , just a few blocks from ground zero			1
" if you see how confined this space is , and you realize the chaos that existed on this street , i think it 's understandable			0
it 's not that surprising , " @entity2 commissioner @entity28 said			1
" it 's very , very confined and no construction work went on , or no clean up went on in this 18 - inch space between the two buildings " after the attacks			0
even so , he said investigators are looking at all possibilities , including whether the part was intentionally placed between the two buildings			2
" we are also looking into a possibility it was lowered by a rope , " @entity28 said , adding that a piece of rope appeared to be intertwined with the part			1
but @entity28 said an initial survey found no marks on the walls between the two buildings consistent with such an object being lowered			2
he also it appears that there is a break in the rope and that it came down from the roof on top of the plane part			2
@entity61 investigators will determine whether the part is from either @entity63 or @entity64 , which hit the twin towers , he said			1
police have said the part includes " a clearly visible @entity69 identification number			1
" on saturday , the @entity2 said police investigators had been in touch with @entity69 , which confirmed the part is from one of its 767 aircraft			1
both flights that hit the @entity7 towers were 767s			2
@entity78 and @entity79 declined to comment			0
@entity69 spokesman @entity80 confirmed the company was asked to " examine the images to see what can be determined			1
" the part was discovered wednesday by surveyors hired by a property owner			2
they called 911 to report that they 'd found " apparently damaged machinery , " police said			2
" the @entity2 is securing the location as it would a crime scene , documenting it photographically , " the police statement said			1
the plane part will not be moved until after the medical examiner 's office completes a health and safety inspection			1
" the office of the chief medical examiner will do an in - depth examination of the site to see if there are , in fact , human remains there , " @entity28 said			1
@entity0 police officers were standing guard through the weekend outside the buildings			0
investigators are expected to return monday to determine how to remove the part			0
the plane part is about five feet long , four feet wide and 17 inches deep , @entity28 said			1
the discovery of the plane part comes more than 11 years after the two airliners slammed into the towers of the @entity7			1
" well , obviously , this is a manifestation of a horrific terrorist attack a block and a half away from where we stand , " @entity28 said			2
" so sure , it brings back terrible memories to anyone who was here and anyone who was involved in that event			0
" @entity126 , whose son @entity127 -- a probationary firefighter -- died when the towers collapsed , said she was not surprised by the find			0
" i 'm disgusted , because after 9/11 the proper search was never done			0
the whole aftermath was uncoordinated			0
it was inadequate , " she said			0
@entity126 has been one of the leading voices and , at times , critics for the families of the september 11 victims , pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris			0
" we advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse , " she said			0
" human remains were thrown at least for a mile , but probably two or three miles from the site			1
" in the years since , a number of pieces of debris as well as human remains have been discovered in @entity151			1
" we are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible , " said @entity152 , president of @entity153 , the owner of 51 @entity16			0
the building had been the site of furious protests , pitting those opposed to putting an @entity10 center near ground zero and those who say it is a center meant to bring people together			0
@entity168 reported from @entity0 ; @entity169 reported and wrote from @entity170			0
@entity1 's @entity171 and @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
