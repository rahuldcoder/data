-- in a move that is antagonizing @entity3 and irking @entity4 , @entity1 commenced a major naval exercise in the @entity6 thursday , the largest since 46 @entity1 sailors died in march in the sinking of a warship			1
the five - day exercise involves some 4,500 personnel and all four branches of the military , according to @entity1 's @entity15 news agency			1
@entity16 , which oversaw an international investigation into the march sinking of the @entity19 , claims a @entity3 submarine sank the corvette and is demanding an apology			1
a multinational investigation also found @entity3 responsible			2
@entity24 has vehemently denied the accusation			0
prior to the @entity19 's sinking , the @entity1 navy had largely discounted the threat of submarines in the @entity6 , due to the shallow waters in the area			1
@entity3 said via state media that it would undertake " strong physical retaliation " and warned fishermen to stay clear of the @entity34 , the disputed maritime border between the @entity35			2
the drills amount to an " undisguised military intrusion , " @entity24 has said			2
" the army and people of the @entity3 are closely watching every move of [ @entity1 president ] @entity44 's group of traitors			1
and if the puppet warmongers dare ignite a war , they will mercilessly destroy the provokers and their stronghold by mobilizing most powerful war tactics and offensive means beyond imagination , " the @entity46 said , according to @entity3 's state - run news agency @entity47			2
" raising issue with the legitimate , defensive exercise is a provocation in itself , " @entity1 rear adm. @entity56 retorted wednesday , speaking to local reporters			2
meanwhile , @entity4 , which has refused to condemn @entity3 over the alleged torpedo attack and which remains @entity24 's closest strategic ally , is reportedly carrying out air defense drills on its @entity6 coast across from the @entity65			1
given @entity3 's decrepit military , experts say the chances of a naval attack on well - prepared @entity1 forces are small			1
" the @entity3 have to rely on asymmetric capabilities , " said @entity71 , who heads the @entity73 's @entity16 offices			2
" in a straight - up fight they are not that capable			0
" deadly @entity3 strikes in past years -- a commando raid on the @entity1 presidential mansion in 1968 ; terrorist bombings in 1983 and 1987 ; and naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 -- all used the element of surprise , an element that would be difficult to spring on the large , alert force @entity1 is fielding for the maneuvers			1
if @entity3 retaliates , it will likely be with a weapons test rather than a direct confrontation , said one expert			0
" they do not do eye - for - eye , tit - for - tat responses , " said @entity90 - wook of the @entity91			0
" shooting a missile or testing a weapon or some kind of diplomatic action are possible , but i do n't think there will be a military reaction			0
" the exercise does not include any @entity104 assets , leading some commentators to wonder whether @entity106 is wary of angering @entity107 in the @entity6			0
@entity1 and @entity104 forces conducted exercises together in the @entity110 last month			1
those exercises included an anti-sub infiltration component -- intended to thwart a submarine attack on a ship			0
if the joint exercises continue , such a move could be part of a gradual build - up of @entity104 pressure on @entity4			1
" the @entity104 is slowly containing @entity4 in other places , and they could exercise in the @entity110 in the future , " said the @entity91 of @entity119 's @entity90			0
" i think the @entity104 is very deliberately pressuring @entity4			0
" the warship sinking has heightened tensions between the two neighbors who fought a war from 1950 to 1953			0
the war ended in an armistice , not a peace treaty , meaning the two nations are still technically at war			0
about 28,500 @entity104 troops are stationed in @entity1			1
@entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0

new : experts say the chances of a @entity3 naval attack are slim
@entity3 says it is watching " every move "
eight days ago , @entity1 ended joint military exercises with the @entity104
the drills are in response to the sinking of a warship , *blamed* on the @entity3
