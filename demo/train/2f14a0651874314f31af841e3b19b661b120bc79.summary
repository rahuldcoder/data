-- former 2004 @entity2 vice presidential nominee @entity1 , who admitted last week that he fathered a child with a videographer who worked on his campaign , has legally separated from his wife , @entity6 , a source close to her said wednesday			1
the source would not say when the separation occurred , only that it happened a while ago			2
the source said he or she spoke to @entity9 in recent days , and would not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation			1
@entity1 issued a statement wednesday , calling it " an extraordinarily sad moment , but i love my children more than anything and still care deeply about @entity6			1
" @entity9 ' publisher , @entity16 , released a statement saying , " @entity6 is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her			1
it was an excruciatingly painful period for her and she [ has ] no interest in rehashing the past			0
" news of the separation comes a week before a tell - all book by @entity26 , a one - time close confidante of @entity1 , is set to hit bookstores			1
" based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available , it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations , " the statement from @entity16 said			0
" [ @entity9 ] will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges , but would like to set the record straight on two key points			1
" first , the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable , hurtful and patently false			0
second , she believed @entity26 to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity to her this past summer			2
she will have nothing further to say			0
" @entity1 , 56 , had denied he was the father of his mistress @entity46 's infant for more than a year , saying his self - admitted affair with her was over before she became pregnant			1
people magazine , a @entity0 sister organization , first reported the story			1
@entity9 ' sister , @entity52 , told @entity49 in an article dated wednesday that @entity9 told her , " i 've had it			1
i ca n't do this			1
i want my life back			0
" the sister told the magazine , " she 's got cancer and has young children and totally believes in marriage ... but she can only do so much			2
" read the @entity62 story @entity1 , a former @entity63 senator from @entity64 , sought his party 's presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008			2
on november 3 , 2004 , the day her husband and sen. @entity68 , @entity69 , conceded the presidential race , @entity9 revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer			1
she discovered a lump in her right breast the last week of the campaign , but said she withheld the diagnosis from her husband to spare him the distraction during the campaign			2
she announced in 2007 that the cancer had recurred			0
last year , she told @entity0 's @entity80 that the medicine she was taking seemed to be working			0
however , she said the situation was " up and down			0
" @entity9 , 60 , and her husband have been married for 32 years			2
they had four children together			0
the oldest , @entity86 , died in a car accident in 1996			0
