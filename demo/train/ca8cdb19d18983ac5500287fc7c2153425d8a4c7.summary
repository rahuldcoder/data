@entity0 , @entity1 -- criminal charges were filed against the co-owner of a @entity1 clinic where a teenager claims she sought an abortion , but instead gave birth to a baby that the woman allegedly threw in the trash			1
@entity13 has a prior conviction of unlicensed practice of medicine for incidents in 2004			2
@entity13 , 43 , was co-owner of the now - defunct @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity1			1
she faces a second - degree felony count of unlicensed practice of a health care profession resulting in serious bodily injury and a third - degree felony count of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence , authorities said tuesday			2
she was arrested and taken into custody , prosecutors said			0
if convicted , she faces a minimum sentence of a year in jail			0
authorities were unable to file more serious charges against @entity13 because they could not prove the baby 's exact cause of death			1
nor could they prove that her actions brought about the death , according to @entity39 , a spokesman for the state attorney 's office in @entity0			2
the baby 's mother , @entity41 , sued the clinic , its staffers and @entity45 , its doctor , last month			1
the @entity46 also revoked @entity45 's license last month			0
although @entity45 was not present when the baby was born , the medical board upheld @entity51 allegations that he falsified medical records , inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice			2
@entity41 claims she sought an abortion at the clinic on july 20 , 2006 , when she believed herself to be about 23 weeks pregnant			1
she was 18 at the time			0
she was told to wait for @entity45 to arrive and given medication			0
when she complained of feeling ill , she said clinic staffers told her to lie down in a patient room			0
she waited for hours , @entity41 claims in her suit , and eventually " felt a large pain " and delivered a baby girl			1
@entity41 " observed the infant moving and making noises for approximately five minutes , " according to an affidavit in support of @entity13 's arrest warrant			1
@entity41 alleges that @entity13 entered the room , used a pair of shears to cut the baby 's umbilical cord , then " scooped up the baby and placed the live baby , placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag , which she sealed , and then threw bag and the baby in a trash can			1
" the doctor later arrived and gave @entity41 a shot to put her to sleep , she alleges in her suit			1
in the affidavit , police said they found out about the incident when they received a tip the following day			0
they searched the clinic for the baby 's remains but were unable to find them			2
@entity13 gave police a statement , meanwhile , and " asserted under oath " that @entity41 ' termination was done by dr. @entity45 while she stood at his side , according to the affidavit			1
she denied that the infant came out alive , police said , but statements from two other clinic employees contradicted her account			2
six days after the first search , police received another tip that the infant 's remains were placed back inside the clinic			2
they executed a search warrant and found the remains			0
they were linked to @entity41 through dna testing , according to the affidavit			0
documents from the state @entity51 say the baby 's cause of death was determined to be " extreme prematurity			0
" however , according to the police affidavit , the medical examiner could not definitively say that the baby had been born alive			1
a birth certificate was issued , because nothing in the autopsy findings disproved @entity41 ' claim the baby was alive and moving			1
experts told police the baby would not have suffocated in the bag because it would have had a limited ability to breathe on its own			1
and an expert reported there was no way to prove for sure that the baby filled its lungs with air because of its underdeveloped lungs , as well as its decomposed state when the remains were found			0
another expert certified in neonatal and perinatal medicine told police he estimated @entity41 ' fetus , based on data from her medical records , to have a gestational age of about 21 and a half weeks -- meaning it had not reached viability , the state where it could survive outside the womb			1
" this expert ... explained that the standard of care for a premature infant delivered at less than 23 weeks is not to attempt resuscitation , " so even if the baby had been born at a hospital , no measures would have been undertaken to save it , according to the affidavit			0
in december 2007 , @entity13 was convicted of unlicensed practice of medicine for actions between august and december of 2004 , and is serving five years ' probation , according to the affidavit			0
however , because the 2006 incident preceded her probation term , she is not accused of violating her probation .			0
