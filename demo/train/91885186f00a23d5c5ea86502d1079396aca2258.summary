it just took a little push to topple the delicately perched boulder -- millions of years in the making -- in @entity5 's @entity4			1
then the man who did it laughed , high - fived his son , and flexed his muscles while being cheered on by a fellow @entity12 leader			2
he is not likely celebrating now , nor is his friend who videotaped then publicized the episode , after both were charged friday with third - degree felonies			0
@entity17 , who pushed over the rock , and the cameraman , @entity19 , face charges of criminal mischief and are accused of intentionally damaging , defacing and destroying property , according to the charging document			1
neither man could be reached by @entity25 on friday for comment on the charges			2
but both have previously defended their actions in interviews with @entity25 affiliate @entity31 , saying they had done a good thing by pushing over a precarious rock that could have otherwise fallen on a passer - by			2
" that was n't going to last very long at all , " @entity19 has said , saying then he would " absolutely " support doing it again			1
" one gust of wind and a family 's dead			0
" ' we have now modified @entity4 ' the men likely would n't have been charged if not for the @entity42 -- specifically , the video @entity19 shot inside the sparse state park and posted to @entity45 , then linked up on @entity46			1
in it , @entity17 is seen behind one of the many unique , ancient rocks in the park , his arm outstretched			1
" wiggle it , just a little bit , " sang @entity19 , the cameraman , mimicking a pop song			1
soon after , @entity19 yells out " boom " then " yeah " as the rock tumbles down			1
" we have now modified @entity4 , " the cameraman jokes , crediting " muscles over here			0
" " some little kid was about to walk down here and die , and @entity17 saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way			1
it 's all about saving lives here at @entity4			0
" authorities , apparently , did n't get the joke or appreciate the life - saving intentions			0
in the days after the incident went viral , park officials suggested the men broke the law by defacing a state park			1
@entity77 , the deputy director of @entity78 , said that in his 22 years on the job he had n't heard of any goblins -- the moniker for the distinctive rock formation that @entity17 toppled -- rolling off their pedestals			1
" obviously , we 're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed , " @entity77 told @entity31			0
strong reaction to video online this was n't just any old rock			2
created over millions of years by windblown dust and moving water , the distinct boulder that @entity17 toppled had been perched gracefully atop a slender rock pedestal			1
it was one of thousands dotting the southern @entity97 , surrounded by a wall of eroded sandstone cliffs			0
in mid-october , @entity17 and @entity19 were among those leading a boy scout group through the distinctive park that is touted online as " a showcase of geologic history			1
" @entity19 told @entity31 that the men did what they did because the boulder in question seemed unstable			1
the man who did the pushing , @entity17 , admitted regretfully to the same station that he wished they 'd alerted a park ranger about the perceived danger because " it was wrong of us to be vigilantes			1
" at the same time , he defended their intent			0
" we thought we were doing a good deed , " @entity17 said			1
it 's not just the " deed " but the celebration that bothered @entity123 , a @entity78 official			2
" it gives you a pit in your stomach , " @entity123 told @entity25 last fall			0
" there seems to be a lot of happiness and joy with the individuals doing this , and it 's not right			0
this is not what you do at a natural scenic area			0
" the @entity138 apparently were n't fond of what happened either			0
the @entity144 and the organization 's @entity145 issued almost simultaneous , similar statements in october dismissing those involved not only from their leadership roles but also from the @entity138 entirely			0
@entity148 pushers get booted by @entity138 many who saw the video online echoed that disgust , like one with the user name @entity153 , who blasted " idiots pushing meaningless boulders around for a ' good ' reason or just for s * * * * and jiggles			2
" but the boulder busters got support , too , from some who agreed it appeared to be a safety hazard			0
others were indifferent , like @entity165			0
" it 's a rock , " he said			2
" why is everyone freaking out ? "			0

@entity17 and @entity19 face felony charges of criminal mischief
@entity17 pushed over an ancient rock at a @entity5 park while @entity19 cheered him on
the men have said they felt the rock was unstable , could have hurt others
but others have blasted their action and *playful* celebration afterward
