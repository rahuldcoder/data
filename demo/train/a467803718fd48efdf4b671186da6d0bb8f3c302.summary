@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the world 's largest passenger plane , has finally conquered the world 's busiest airport			1
@entity8 kicked off its double - decker @entity10 service this week from @entity12 to @entity0 , which celebrated friday with a spectacular ceremony			2
shortly after touching down , @entity14 slowly taxied to its specially modified gate under a towering arch of water cannons			0
@entity0 's @entity19 airport , which handled some 95 million passengers last year , is now the seventh @entity22 airfield able to handle this ginormous aircraft			1
but nearly six years after the @entity3 entered service , it 's unclear whether bigger is necessarily better			1
@entity19 's airport spent about $ 30 million in passenger fees for runway , taxiway and jetway modifications , which enabled @entity31 -- one of @entity14 's approximately 350 passengers -- to easily exit the aircraft after a 13 - hour , 7,100 - mile nonstop journey			1
vine video of the @entity36 taking off friday @entity31 was returning home to @entity0 with his 3 - year - old daughter after visiting family in @entity12			0
" inside , when you 're flying , it really does n't feel that different from any other plane , " said @entity31 , 33			0
" but when you see it from the outside , you 're reminded how huge it is			0
" more floor space and quieter engines air travel is projected to explode in the coming decades			1
airlines are looking to freshen their fleets , while aircraft makers are pitching their new planes as the wave of the future			0
the @entity10 boasts quieter engines and lightweight construction to save fuel			2
and it 's roomy -- with 50 % more floor space than its competitor , the relatively new @entity63 747 - 8 , which seats 400 to 500 passengers			1
# @entity66 : behind the scenes at the world 's busiest airport more than four decades after the original 747 @entity71 , it 's hard for any giant airliner to avoid comparisons to the enormously successful icon			1
@entity8 has taken some of the @entity3 's floor space and created a " @entity79 " lounge hosted by a bartender			1
also aboard is a " duty - free showcase " where passengers can shop for cosmetics , perfumes , liquor and accessories			2
upstairs , they can find luxurious @entity89 suites and lie - flat sleepers spaced 6 feet apart			0
first class takes up the forward part of the lower floor with economy filling up the rear			2
upstairs , it 's all business class , offering comfy seating but less privacy			2
" the cabin is really modern , " @entity31 said			0
" i liked the duty - free shop , and the lounge made me feel like a vip			0
" a cruise liner in the sky " the reality is that if you 're on the upper deck , you do n't know there 's another deck below you , " says @entity105 of @entity106			0
Â " and if you 're on the lower deck , it 's like sitting on a 747			0
" in 2007 , at the @entity10 's @entity22 coming out party at @entity117 's @entity116 , the plane was compared to a cruise liner in the sky			1
but the @entity10 's reputation hit a rough spot in 2011 when a taxiing @entity3 clipped a smaller plane at @entity116 so hard it turned it 45 degrees			1
clearly @entity63 did n't think bigger is always better			0
in the 1990s @entity63 briefly partnered with @entity10 to collaborate on a new wide - body four - engine airliner before backing out			1
instead , @entity63 chose to build on its previous success			0
the newest version of the 747 -- the 747 - 8 entered service in 2011 with room for 51 extra passengers than its previous version -- falls short of @entity10 's capacity , although it is longer			1
@entity63 's new 747 warmed the hearts of countless aviation geeks who still crush on the plane 's distinctive front bulge			0
and it 's not just geeks who like it			0
a recent poll of 1,000 fliers by airfarewatchdog.com showed @entity63 's 777 and 747 beating out the @entity10			1
both @entity63 and @entity10 have suffered through mechanical problems with new aircraft -- the @entity10 with wing cracks and the @entity145 with overheating batteries			2
seven @entity22 airports can land the @entity10 nonetheless , after two years in business , @entity63 's 747 - 8 has received more than 100 orders			1
@entity105 points out that @entity63 's @entity145 , which seats up to 300 and has been in service for two years , has surpassed 900 orders			2
compare that to the @entity10 , which has been in service six years and has yet to crack 300			2
so now @entity0 joins six other @entity22 cities where travelers can fly the @entity10 : @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity117 's @entity116 , @entity158 's @entity157 , @entity159 and @entity160			1
is the @entity10 opening new routes ? not really , says @entity105 , although the @entity3 has " enabled airlines like @entity163 to put more seats on existing routes at a lower cost			1
" the 787 , however , is opening new routes that traditionally have n't worked because of cost issues or range limits , he says , including @entity169 's from @entity160 to @entity170 , @entity171			0
@entity172 ' from @entity173 , @entity174 , to @entity175			0
in the end , which will dominate long - distance flight ? will we regularly soar above the clouds in four - engined , double - decker hotels ? or will travelers prefer single - floor planes with two engines and fewer perks ? for @entity31 and his daughter as they come to the end of their trans - @entity192 journey , that 's not really at the top of their agenda			2
they 're just glad to be home .			0

@entity19 's becomes 7th @entity22 airport where the giant @entity10 airliner can land
the @entity10 seats up to *853* passengers compared with @entity204 to 500
the @entity3 has 50 % more floor space than any other airliner
are bigger airliners better ? passengers , airline *experts* weigh in
