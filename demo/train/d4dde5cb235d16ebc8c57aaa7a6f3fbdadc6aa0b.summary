@entity0 is ending her @entity3 boycott in a spirit of " forgiveness " 14 years after suffering racist abuse at the @entity9 resort 's showpiece tennis tournament			1
@entity10 , who won the @entity11 with victory over @entity13 in @entity14 last month , announced her decision -- explained in an exclusive interview with @entity17 -- on @entity18			1
back in 2001 , age 19 , she lifted her second @entity3 trophy by beating @entity21 -- but she and her family were racially abused by some members of the crowd after sister @entity25 withdrew from their semifinal with an injury			1
that sparked accusations from some that their father , @entity31 , was " fixing " games between the two			2
he later said the abuse the family had suffered during the final " shamed @entity35			1
" his daughter told @entity17 he " had to sit and watch his daughter being taunted , sparking cold memories of his experiences growing up in the @entity42			2
" she instantly vowed never to return to the scene of her first - ever professional victory , in a doubles match with @entity25 in 1997 , but revealed that she now felt ready to go back and compete in the @entity3 , being played in march			1
" i 'm fortunate to be at a point in my career where i have nothing to prove , " @entity0 explained			2
" i 'm still as driven as ever , but i play for the love of the game			1
" it is with that love in mind , and a new understanding of the true meaning of forgiveness , that i will proudly return to @entity3 in 2015			1
" the 33 - year - old said a feeling that attitudes in tennis had progressed had helped to make up her mind , citing the prompt action taken by the @entity63 and @entity64 when she and @entity25 were victims of racist and sexist comments made by a @entity68 official last year			1
" i have thought about going back to @entity3 many times over my career , " @entity0 said			0
" i said a few times that i would never play there again			2
and believe me , i meant it			0
i admit it scared me			0
what if i walked onto the court and the entire crowd booed me ? the nightmare would start all over			0
" she said it had been " difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the @entity3 locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to @entity80 feeling as if i had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality			1
" " emotionally it seemed easier to stay away , " she explained			0
" there are some who say i should never go back			0
there are others who say i should have returned years ago			0
" i understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time			0
i 'm just following my heart on this one			0
" her decision was welcomed by tournament ceo @entity94 , who confirmed that she had accepted a wild card for the event			2
" we really look forward to watching her compete again , " he said .			0
