-- as a @entity3 activist i was devastated to learn the president would delay executive action to keep undocumented immigrants with no criminal record from getting deported			1
he 'd promised he 'd do it , our community expected it , and the country 's economy needed it -- especially as @entity15 have abdicated their obligation to pass real and lasting legislative reform for our broken immigration system			1
but as a political strategist , i understand why the president delayed his decision			0
let 's be clear : this is @entity24 's promise delayed , not broken			1
the decision was indeed political			0
but unlike his critics on both sides of the aisle -- the activists who , like me , are deeply disappointed , and @entity15 who hypocritically accuse him of giving @entity32 a slap in the face -- i believe it was political for the right reasons			1
the president 's action was a political " @entity39 : " first do no harm			0
there are a handful of vulnerable @entity43 in very red states that are fighting to be re-elected , and control of the @entity46 is in the balance			1
hanging on to a @entity43 - controlled @entity46 is essential to the future of any legislative fix on immigration			1
it is also essential to keeping the president 's @entity52 on @entity54 , or @entity55 , in place			1
if @entity15 take over the @entity46 , @entity32 -- indeed the entire country -- can kiss any possibility of real reform goodbye and can expect an immediate full frontal attack to repeal @entity55			1
the president said on " @entity62 " that the reason for the decision was that the politics on the issue had changed since he made the announcement in the @entity68 in june			2
by june , public attention to the influx of unaccompanied minors was just starting to hit a crescendo			0
and @entity15 were masterly in injecting cynicism as well as downright lies into the discussion of the cause of the influx and the security at the border			2
when the president finally makes his announcement before the end of the year , the @entity81 people , understandably distressed about what has been happening at the border , will deserve a full accounting on the realities of border security , the undocumented flows into the country , why our economy needs immediate action and why we need to achieve real legislative reform in the long run			0
with everything going on in the foreign policy arena as the country confronts a brutal terrorist organization in @entity100 that is seeking to do us harm , as well as the politicking of midterm elections upon us , there is no room in the public square for a real dialogue that would explain and sustain the president 's executive action and draw support to the reasons to work toward real reform			2
the president will need to lay out facts and figures that prove the border is safer and more secure now than ever before			0
these would include : -- under both president @entity118 and president @entity119 , the undocumented population grew at an unprecedented level			0
even after the summer influx of undocumented children , under president @entity24 , the growth has been net negative			2
-- the flow of unaccompanied minors now is less than it was in february of 2013			0
-- there has been an unprecedented surge in resources at the border under president @entity24 that includes doubling the number of @entity133 agents and tripling the money that goes to technology and infrastructure			2
-- the border is safer today and border crime is down from 10 years ago			0
he should reiterate the benefits of letting undocumented immigrants work and contribute legally to our economy			0
he should explain that in the long run , these immigrants should have to get right with the law , pass a background check , pay a fine and back taxes , learn @entity148 , and then get in line behind others who are following current legal procedures in order to become a @entity81 citizen ( key elements to real immigration reform )			1
the president should underscore that passing real immigration reform will inject more than $ 700 billion into our economy over the next 10 years , and $ 1.4 trillion over the next 20 , reduce the deficit by almost a $ 1 trillion in the next 20 years , raise wages , as undocumented workers will no longer be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers , and boost our overall global competitiveness			1
there is a reason why most ( even conservative ) economists support immigration reform and why the business community has joined with the faith community , law enforcement leaders and labor in an improbable alliance of partners working toward this type of reform			1
while i am disappointed the president 's executive action is not coming sooner -- and any family ripped apart in the interim is one too many -- we also have to consider two things that will make it improbable that an undocumented immigrant without a criminal record in the interior of the country would be immediately removed : 1 ) the 2011 new @entity189 policy that made it administration policy to deprioritize non-criminal undocumented immigrants and focus resources on removing the most dangerous criminals from our midst			0
in fact , of the 370,000 undocumented immigrants removed last year , all but 10,000 had criminal records -- and yes , that is still too big a number			0
this is why we need real reform now			0
2 ) since june , the removal architecture of the immigration system -- enforcement agents , and immigration judges -- has moved from the interior to the border to deal with the influx of unaccompanied minors more fairly and efficiently			0
i know these assurances are not enough for immigration activists seeking immediate relief			1
but even @entity32 who are as deeply saddened as i am that we will not see action for another several weeks , at least , understand that what we will be getting from president @entity24 is far more effective and real than what we have gotten so far from @entity15 who have turned their backs on our community and the @entity81 economy			1
if not for @entity15 inaction , immigration reform would be a reality today			1
so amigos , let 's be confident president @entity24 will act before the end of the year			2
if he does n't , i will be the first one to join you in a picket line at the @entity230 .			2

as an activist , @entity232 devastated that @entity24 *deferring* executive order on immigration
as a strategy , though , she gets it . he did n't want it used by @entity15 as election issue to win @entity46
she says if @entity15 wins , kiss immigration reform and @entity55 goodbye . advocates , be *patient*
@entity232 : if he fails to deliver after vote , she *'ll* join immigration activists , hold him to account
