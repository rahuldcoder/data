-- it always made me laugh to hear stories about the insanity that would go on between @entity5 and @entity6 during the making of the movie " @entity9			1
" the truth was @entity5 and i did n't bump into each other once during the making of that film			1
i recorded the @entity15 role , and he recorded the genie separately			0
so when i saw the film for the first time at the premiere , i was able to laugh along with the rest of the audience at @entity5 's performance			1
i had never heard it before			0
where i did run into @entity5 quite often was in the place where he was most at home , in the comedy clubs			1
@entity5 would pop into places like @entity29 and the @entity30 in @entity31 , would run onstage and just explode			1
i remember in particular one night , back in those days , when he was hot from his tv hit , " @entity33 and @entity34 , " and i was n't yet well - known			1
i was just building a reputation in comedy circles , and i was about to go up onstage at the @entity30			2
i was standing in the section right outside the restroom where the comics waited to be introduced onstage			0
all of a sudden , the club door opened and @entity5 popped in			1
the people in charge of the club said , " ok , we 're putting @entity5 on next			1
" i could n't really argue with that ; he was certainly a bigger name than i was			2
but to my amazement , @entity5 told them , " i have a bunch of people in the audience tonight , and i would really like to make sure they see @entity6 first			1
" opinion : @entity5 ca n't be dead i went up onstage			1
i did quite well and as i walked offstage , @entity5 came up to me wiping his eyes from laughing and said to me , " @entity6 , you really baked my cookies			1
" i of course took this as a strange sexual double entendre , and i always do , but @entity5 meant it as a sincere compliment			1
he was a fixture of the comedy club scene back then , one of the celebs who 'd pop in to try out material , or in @entity5 's case , just burst out with any craziness that would pop into his head			1
but he was also generous to his fellow stand - up comedians : there were a number of times when @entity5 was onstage and i was at the club , and he would call out to me and invite me to play with him onstage			1
riffing with @entity5 was extremely invigorating -- and extremely exhausting			1
i knew i had to be on my toes every second			0
and when we would actually connect onstage , it was electric for me			0
@entity79 ' families remember @entity5 as ' comedic @entity80 ' to see @entity5 perform was an experience			1
he was more than a comedian			0
he was a comedy force of nature			2
i remember hearing that @entity5 was once doing a press junket in @entity85			1
one of the reporters asked him , " why is it that @entity85 is not known for comedy ? " @entity5 answered , " well , you killed all your funny people			1
" i laughed out loud when i heard that			0
i thought , how sick and how wonderfully truthful			0
when i heard the news of @entity5 's passing , it was a double shock			1
it was stunning that he was now gone and that , according to police , it was apparently suicide			0
i 've known people who have committed suicide , and my shock always reveals how little i knew about them			0
@entity5 had spoken in the press about his substance abuse issues over the years , and he was dealing with it in rehab			2
i had heard at one point he was prescribed pills and that he did n't want to take them because he was afraid it would interfere with his comic creativity			0
i thought , when i heard that , of his idol , @entity110			0
@entity5 worshipped the comedian , who died last year			2
@entity114 had his own problems and also was afraid medicating would interfere with his comic creativity			0
complete coverage on @entity5 i ca n't say that i had a close relationship with @entity5 -- it was mainly kibitzing back and forth in the clubs			1
the few times we 'd have a conversation that would become serious , he or both of us would quickly veer off into jokes or silliness			0
now , in retrospect , it may have been that @entity5 joked so much and was always " on " perhaps to hide something			2
of course , that 's just dime - store psychology			0
the last memory i have of him was a benefit that comedian @entity132 was organizing at the comedy club @entity133 on @entity134 to raise consciousness about scleroderma			2
it was a fun night			0
@entity139 was there performing , as was @entity5 and myself			1
after the show , @entity140 stopped by			0
he had been doing a show and was unable to make the benefit			0
@entity144 and @entity5 greeted each other			2
then @entity5 came over and spoke to me			2
we chatted for a little bit , and @entity5 said to me , " would you like to join us ? we 're going out for dessert			2
" the three of us went to one of these showbiz bar - restaurants in @entity153			0
it was the middle of the night , and we sat eating our desserts and exchanging comedy showbiz stories , memories and anecdotes			2
there was a lot of laughing -- a good time			0
on our way out of the place , we passed by another table where , surprisingly , comedy great @entity164 was sitting			0
i did n't know @entity164 , so @entity140 and @entity5 both approached him and were talking to him , and i stood off to the side			1
@entity5 and the dark side of comedy @entity5 went out of his way to tell @entity164 how funny i was at the benefit			1
he repeated some of my jokes and @entity164 laughed			0
this was once again @entity5 proving what a generous person he was			1
later , out in the street as he got in a cab , @entity140 yelled to me , half - jokingly , but quite truthfully , " i guess we 'll talk in another 30 years			0
" i was left on the dark street with @entity5			2
he told me he was going to a meeting for substance abuse			0
we said one or two more things and laughed and then we hugged each other			0
afterward , @entity5 warmly said , " bye , " and i stood there as he turned around and walked off into the darkness .			2

@entity6 and @entity5 did voices for " @entity9 " but did n't bump into each other
they did meet in comedy clubs , where @entity5 was at home , generous to others , he says
it was always invigorating , exhausting performing together , @entity6 says
@entity6 : last memory of @entity5 was a night out in @entity31 , where he was *gracious*
