after sen. @entity3 likened her to @entity4 , @entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 is taking the pop star 's advice			1
just " shake it off			0
" that 's how @entity9 responded monday to @entity3 's remarks last week that @entity9 was n't fit to be @entity12 's senator just because she 's " really attractive and she sounds nice			1
" " i do n't care if she 's as good looking as @entity4 or as nice as mr. @entity20 , but if she votes like @entity21 , she 's wrong for the state of @entity12 , " @entity3 said at the @entity16 @entity15 ' annual fall barbecue , according to footage obtained by @entity18 published sunday night			1
he backtracked on monday , calling his comments a mistake and praising @entity9 's campaign			2
" i should n't have said those things , i know that			0
i regret anytime someone feels offended by what i have said , " @entity3 said			0
" but i am only human and i can make mistakes sometimes in how i say something			0
in fact , i have complimented her on running a very good campaign			0
" his apology came after @entity9 fired back monday on @entity36 and in an interview with @entity39 affiliate @entity38 and said @entity3 would have never made those comments if she were a man			1
" i was very offended that sen. @entity3 would say that			2
i think it 's unfortunate that he and many of their party believe you ca n't be a real woman if you 're conservative and you 're female , " @entity9 said on @entity36			2
" i believe if my name had been @entity9 attached to my resume , sen. @entity3 would not have said those things			1
" @entity9 also slammed @entity15 for their " phony war on women			0
" " i am a woman and second i have been to war			0
i am a combat veteran , this is not a war on women and anytime @entity15 use the word war , they need to do it to honor our servicemen and women , " @entity9 said monday			2
@entity9 has gained momentum recently in the race against her @entity15 opponent rep. @entity68 , leading by two points in the latest @entity39 / @entity72 poll and up by 7 points in a @entity75 poll released this weekend			1
but a @entity77 poll released monday , one day before voters head to the voting booth said the race is all tied up with each candidate pulling 47 %			1
@entity12 is arguably one of the most crucial @entity1 races of the cycle that could hand over control of the @entity1 to republicans if @entity9 prevails			1
@entity9 would be the state 's first female senator			0
@entity3 's office did not immediately responded to @entity39 request for comment monday .			0
