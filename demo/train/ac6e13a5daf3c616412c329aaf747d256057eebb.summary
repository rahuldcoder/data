@entity1 's announcement on thursday that it would be introducing a new @entity3 textbook experience and @entity5 authoring tool presents huge opportunities for technology in classrooms			1
the company is selling textbooks from @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 at a price comparable to print versions , and it 's presented an unprecedented opportunity for teachers to compile their own materials			0
but @entity1 has a long way to go -- and logistical hurdles to clear in tens of thousands of schools -- before it dominates @entity23 classrooms the way it has done the music industry			1
instructional technology resource teacher @entity26 recently purchased @entity3 for two of the @entity29 classrooms in her 160 - school district using federal funds allocated for students with limited @entity34 proficiency			1
getting approval for the actual purchase was fairly easy			0
she sent a written request to the district cio , and he approved it			0
but it took five months to get the @entity3 up and running after they arrived			1
in order to download new apps , she needed to get the @entity1 volume purchase program approved as a vendor by the budget group			1
but who would explain to the budget committee the process of paying with an @entity49 ? who would be responsible for downloading the volume - purchased apps ? could the students use them outside of their hour - long @entity29 class ? the list of logistical issues went on			1
" because nobody in our district had done it before , it took a long time , " @entity26 says			0
becoming the next big thing by @entity1 's count , 1.5 million @entity3 are being used by schools			1
but there are 55.5 million students enrolled in more than 130,000 @entity70 schools			1
no matter how you slice it , the @entity3 is not a mainstream phenomenon in @entity23			1
nor is there any guarantee it will become so			0
one - to - one initiatives for laptops have been pushing forward for years without mainstream adoption			0
@entity81 , for instance , gave 33,000 middle school students and 3,000 teachers personal laptops as early as 2002			2
but in 2009 , a survey by the @entity86 found that while 99 % of public school teachers have some access to computers , just 29 % of public school teachers use them during instructional time " often			0
" just 3 % of schools in a 2010 survey by the @entity94 said they have a one - to - one computer ratio			0
ipads do have a couple of advantages over one - to - one laptop initiatives			0
@entity26 points out that the @entity3 ' batteries last longer than the laptops she oversees in other classrooms			1
they also have been less expensive to maintain than the computers — not a single one has been damaged — and do n't work as stand - ins for desktop computers , but as cameras , gps devices and video cameras			0
" with a laptop you were stuck with consuming content , " says @entity112 , who works as an @entity113 in the same district as @entity26			0
" but with the @entity3 you 're taking videos and looking at ideas in a new way			2
" textbook availability even though @entity1 's first @entity3 textbooks will sell for $ 15 or less , they wo n't be any less expensive for schools than paper books			1
@entity126 , head @entity127 , tells @entity128 that @entity5 will be sold to schools rather than directly to students , but that schools will grant students access to those books through their personal ids			1
in other words , even if a school reuses @entity3 , it wo n't be able to reuse books			1
the books will be kept on individual students ' @entity141 accounts			2
schools reuse the same paper book for about five years , and those books usually cost about $ 75			1
because a new book will be purchased every year , the @entity147 version still costs $ 75 for five years			0
relying on ibooks as textbooks is n't a feasible option for most public schools at the moment because @entity13 , @entity11 and @entity12 have each dedicated just a small number of titles each			2
@entity126 puts the typical cycle for textbook approval in most states at about five years			0
unless the school happens to be using one of the selected titles , it ca n't use ibooks yet			2
most other options for digital textbooks that can be read on an @entity3 -- including @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 — focus on books for higher education			1
unless major publishers decide to add more of their titles to ibooks , it wo n't be a feasible default reader in most schools			1
@entity126 says that @entity11 has already committed to adding five additional titles before september , but it will commit to additional titles based on uptake			0
broadband and red tape in a @entity185 2010 survey of the schools in its program for discounted telecommunications , almost 80 % said their internet connections do n't fully meet their current needs			2
" it 's not atypical to see one classroom of students on connected devices bring down a network , " @entity126 says			0
before schools introduce connected devices , many of them will need to introduce better internet connections			0
and that 's just one logistical issue			0
schools and districts will likely have a longer list specific to their circumstances			0
consider the situation that @entity112 , who recently helped put an @entity3 in the hands of every administrator in his district , faces when he thinks about introducing @entity3 district - wide : some types of funding , like the one used to buy @entity3 for the @entity29 classrooms , ca n't be used for anything already being paid for by the school district			1
if the district bought @entity3 for some students , in other words , it would be cutting off other sources of funding			1
bringing @entity3 to the mainstream many schools already use @entity3 in their courses			1
policies that allow students to bring their own devices to school might make make this more common			2
according to a 2011 @entity235 survey , 70 % percent of college students and college - bound high school seniors are interested in owning a tablet device , and 20 % expect to purchase a tablet within the next six months			2
the inevitable price decline on the @entity3 could also make @entity3 a more mainstream conduit for educational material			2
" this is a change in how school districts think , " @entity112 says , " and in a larger school district , that can take some time			0
" see the original article on @entity128			0

@entity1 has a long way to go before it dominates @entity23 classrooms
there are 55.5 million students enrolled in more than 130,000 @entity70 schools
even if a school reuses @entity3 , it wo n't be able to reuse books
