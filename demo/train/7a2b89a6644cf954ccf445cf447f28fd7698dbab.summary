it lived about 100 million years ago , weighed four tons and likely was at the very top of its prehistoric food chain			1
researchers from @entity6 's @entity5 , the @entity7 and @entity8 announced friday the discovery of @entity10 , a dinosaur that stretched more than 30 feet long , in eastern @entity12			1
given its size and other characteristics , they believe this creature ruled its ecosystem in the middle of the @entity19 , a period known as the last in the so - called " @entity20			0
" it 's not known if @entity10 existed alongside @entity22 ; fossils found from the same patch of @entity12 's @entity25 shows it did share the land with tyrannosaurs			1
but relatively speaking , these tyrannosaurs were much smaller ( and below the 7 or so tons of later @entity29 ) and definitely down on the predatory food chain			2
" at least 98 million years ago , we know that ( tyrannosaurs ) were small and somebody else was top dog in the neighborhood , " said @entity31 , @entity5 's dinosaur curator			1
" ( @entity10 ) is a large dinosaur , " he adds			1
" and we have no evidence -- nor do the teams that worked in this area prior to us -- of anything bigger			0
" its size and appearance alone are reason enough to excite paleontologists			2
but there are a few other facts that make this find noteworthy , said @entity31			0
one is that @entity10 helps to fill in a roughly 30 - million - year gap in the geologic record in @entity53 , a period for which relatively little is known about dinosaurs on the continent			1
another : its closest carchardontosaurian ( the family it hails from ) kin hailed from elsewhere in the world , suggesting there was more movement and dispersion of dinosaurs at a time the continents had largely already drifted apart than had been thought			1
" until 10 years ago , we thought this was a time period when @entity53 dinosaurs were isolated , " @entity31 said			1
" the evidence is growing that was not actually the case			0
dinosaurs were quite good at spreading around the world			2
" name means ' cannibalistic monster ' desert heat of 110 degrees @entity80 -- so hot that @entity31 's dog burned his paws -- is bad enough			0
but for a paleontologist , working in this oven all summer without any big finds ? that 's definitely a lot worse			0
but with a few days in the 2008 field season , @entity88 from the @entity7 spotting something she and her colleagues , including @entity31 , found curious			2
the group returned the next year , opening up a bigger area , but still had more work to do once the season ended			0
finally , with the help of a jackhammer , they finished unearthing their discovery in 2010 , according to @entity31			0
he said , initially , these experts would have speculated the new creature was related to @entity22 or @entity102 , both of which roamed what is now @entity53			2
@entity107 team finds new hammerhead shark species the more they dug , literally and figuratively , the paleontologists realized the species belonged to the carchardontosaurian family , with relatives like the giant @entity113 , a carnivore that dates to the @entity115 and has been found in @entity116			1
the name for the new dinosaur , @entity10 , refers to a cannibalistic monster in mythology of @entity121 , a @entity123 people who lived where it was found			1
" this dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great @entity22 and perhaps @entity131 in the @entity53 fossil record , " said @entity88 , the lead author of the study in @entity126 announcing the discovery , in a press release			1
new legless lizards found in @entity134 and it has n't been an isolated breakthrough			0
@entity31 notes that , since @entity10 , their crews found two other dinosaur species nearby from the same period that likewise are related to others from different continents			1
@entity88 expects more such fresh insights in the years to come			0
" @entity10 is just the tip of the iceberg , " she said			2
" our teams are unearthing a lost dinosaurian ecosystem right here in the badlands of @entity53			0
" @entity152 ' @entity151 unicorn ' caught on camera			0

paleontologists say they found a new dinosaur species , @entity10 , in @entity12
at more than 30 feet long and over 4 tons , it was a *dominant* carnivore predator
it predates @entity22 , filling a hole in the geologic record from 100 million years ago
its closet kin were in other continents , indicating dinosaurs spread *widely*
