@entity0 -- @entity0 judge @entity2 ruled friday to stay the execution of @entity4 and grant a new penalty phase in the case , after finding that authorities had suppressed evidence of alleged sexual abuse			1
@entity4 , 46 , had been scheduled to be executed on october 3 for a 1984 slaying in which he beat @entity11 to death with a tire iron			1
@entity2 found " reasonable probability " that the verdict might have been different had allegations of abuse surfaced during the initial case , noting that the relationship between the two men had been established but not disclosed			2
@entity4 attorney @entity21 said the defense team is " very gratified " by the decision , having maintained that information about the alleged abuse was withheld from the trial and that @entity4 ' life should instead be spent in a cell			1
the sexual abuse began when @entity4 was 6 years old , his attorneys have said			2
they argued that the jurors who convicted @entity4 more than 25 years ago were told that it was a robbery - homicide case and never learned of the abuse allegations			1
@entity0 district attorney @entity34 said friday that he would appeal the decision			1
he has said the abuse allegations are hearsay and " a last - ditch effort to escape punishment			1
" " in the 28 years since the murder of @entity11 , these new allegations only came to light just a few months ago , and ( @entity4 ) is not the one making the allegations			1
" announcing the scheduled execution , @entity46 gov. @entity45 's office described the brutal @entity0 killing			2
@entity4 and accomplice @entity51 led @entity52 , 56 , to an area near a cemetery , forced him to lie on the ground , tied him up , gagged him and stole his valuables , the governor 's office said in a statement			0
" @entity4 and @entity51 repeatedly beat the man with a tire iron and a socket wrench and then drove away in the victim 's car			2
@entity4 later returned and burned @entity11 's body , " the statement said			2
@entity51 is serving a life sentence			0
on september 17 , the state 's @entity66 failed to reach the unanimous agreement required to recommend clemency			0
three members of the five - person panel voted in favor of asking @entity45 to consider granting clemency			0
but the two other board members voted against the petition			0
since the execution date was set , a number of high - profile supporters have called for clemency in the case , including @entity46 attorney general @entity81			0
more than 360,000 people have signed an online petition asking authorities to spare @entity4 ' life			0
@entity11 's widow has also asked for the execution to be called off			0
but @entity11 's daughter wants the execution to go forward , the @entity0 district attorney 's office said			1
she said friday that accusations of sexual abuse were false and asked the court to uphold the death penalty .			0
