@entity0 , @entity1 -- the news ? they ca n't watch it anymore			0
outsiders criticizing their progress , saying they 're not working fast enough or smart enough -- it 's too much to bear			1
they understand how awful the situation is			0
they are , after all , working on the waters where friends and relatives died			1
those losses , and the stories they hear from workers who survived the @entity18 explosion , are with them every day			1
it 's a weight they carry as the world watches			1
these men and women are working to drill a relief well -- 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the seafloor , @entity24 adm. @entity23 says			1
it is the only surefire way to stop the oil that 's spewing into the @entity1			1
" it takes time to dig a relief well safely and efficiently , which is what we 're trying to do , " capt. @entity31 says			1
" our goal is to stem the flow of oil -- the long - term solution , not the short - term solution			1
" as of thursday , @entity41 says the drill for this relief well has reached a depth of 13,978 feet			2
see a @entity41 image of both relief well statuses , last updated on may 30 there are fewer than 200 workers on board at any one time			1
they are marine biologists , scientists , construction and tool experts			0
they must understand the physics of what they 're doing			2
simple hired hands ? not even close			0
they work on the rig in three - week shifts , living in simple quarters and eating in a space not unlike a school cafeteria			1
mementos from home , pictures of the families they leave behind to do this work , appear on desks			0
most of them come from @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 -- the very places that will be hardest hit by the oil - riddled waters			1
so for them , what they 're doing is more than a job , the kind of job that 's been passed on through generations			1
they are trying to protect their own homes			0
and they 're trying to right what has gone so horribly wrong			2
" part of the problem is that there is a lot of outside scrutiny on what it is that we 're doing out here , " capt. @entity87 says			2
" the @entity97 population is wanting this well done			0
we all want it done now			0
but we all have to understand that this is a well that killed 11 people ... and sunk a rig			2
so we 're not going to speed up , and we 're going to do this as safe as possible			1
" to get to where disaster struck on april 20 takes a one - hour helicopter ride from @entity111 , @entity74			1
from the air , heading out there , one can see efforts to contain the spreading oil			2
large floating booms arc in the water to absorb the crude			0
the large black slicks or dark pools one might expect to see are not visible			0
instead there are orange pancake - like deposits , the result of oil that 's been exposed to the elements			1
@entity23 , during the flight , notices what no outsider can			0
the shifting winds change the flow trajectory in the water			0
based on this , he predicts @entity135 , @entity136 , will be hit with oil in a couple of days			1
a couple of days later , it is			2
but the smell -- like fresh tar -- ca n't be missed by anyone			0
it only grows stronger as the @entity24 helicopter reaches its destination , landing on @entity147 across the water , @entity148 works on the backup relief well , while @entity151 tries to cap the gushing oil			1
it is beneath that rig that underwater cameras are trained on the oil the world is seeing			1
support vessels between the three rigs are busy offering their own help to the massive effort			0
two boats fire fresh water from their sterns , a move meant to lessen the fumes emanating from the contaminated water			0
safety is top of mind on this rig			2
visitors landing on the rig must go downstairs to watch a safety video , take off accessories like earrings and put on a hard hat , goggles and steel - toed boots			1
a woman working at a desk thanks the @entity2 crew for finally telling the workers ' story			1
nearby , on a table , are copies of a special magazine memorializing the @entity18 workers who died			1
the operation is enormous , the equipment and technicalities overwhelming			0
in meeting rooms , screens monitor progress and maps dot walls			0
the diagrams the @entity24 admiral draws to help explain matters leave a journalist 's head spinning			2
but he tries to explain in simple terms			0
" the intention is to intercept the wellbore , well down below the surface near the reservoir , then pump heavy mud in to counteract the pressure of the oil coming up , " @entity23 says			2
" that will allow them to basically plug or kill the well			0
once that 's done , you could do things like remove the blowout preventer , bring it to the surface and try to find out what happened			2
" get a taste of the chaos that is adm. @entity23 's life on deck , it 's a loud and constant operation			2
voices call back and forth , giving directions amid massive equipment that towers above			0
people operating the drill and two cranes maneuver across the rig in a carefully orchestrated ballet			0
the incessant drilling brings an endless vibration			0
there is no idle chit - chat for these @entity232 employees , who are working 12 - hour shifts , around the clock			1
it 's intense , serious , focused			0
" i just want everybody to know that we 're doing everything we possibly can , " says @entity87			1
" we 're not going to rush			1
we 're not going to hurt anybody			0
we 're going to protect everybody , and we 're going to remember that this is a place where we had a catastrophic event			0

@entity2 's @entity244 gets *exclusive* access to rig drilling relief well to stop gushing oil
workers put in 12 - hour days and feel weight of world watching and criticizing them
the men and women feel the loss of friends and family who died in waters there
" we 're doing everything we possibly can , " but must stay safe , not rush , captain says
