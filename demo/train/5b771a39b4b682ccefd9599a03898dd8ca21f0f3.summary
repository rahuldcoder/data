-- @entity1 , 17 , was a straight - a student , a high school track star and she loved to volunteer			1
now , she 's been killed , the latest victim of what you could call " junk justice			2
" when @entity8 went running in a @entity11 , @entity10 , park , it 's doubtful she had any idea that another young female runner had been attacked in that very same park just a couple of months before			1
that first victim said she feared her attacker was going to rape her			0
she managed to get away by elbowing the large man in the nose			0
if there were falling rocks in that park , a warning sign would be up			1
if a hungry coyote had been spotted scrounging for food , a warning sign would tell you			2
but there was no warning at all that a human predator , on the hunt for young women , might be in the park			1
if there had been a sketch of this suspect , or a warning posted , @entity8 might not have gone running alone there			1
police said dna on @entity8 's underwear led them to 30 - year - old @entity41 they showed his picture to the first runner and she said , " he 's the same guy			1
" now he 's been charged with @entity8 's rape and murder			1
the suspect was a registered sex offender			1
in 2000 , he lured a 13 - year - old girl into his home on the pretext of watching the movie " @entity52			2
" once he got her inside , he molested her and beat her to a pulp before she escaped			0
before @entity55 was sentenced , a psychiatrist warned that he showed no remorse and would likely attack a young girl again			1
he recommended " the maximum sentence allowed by law			0
" the courts sentenced @entity55 to six years ; he got out after five			0
five years for pummeling a 13 - year - old girl in the face and fondling her			2
that is " junk justice			0
" if @entity55 had been prosecuted to the full extent of the law then , he would have been behind bars when @entity8 went for a run on february 25			1
her grieving mom spoke directly to this point to @entity73 thursday night ... " i mean how many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever ? i just do n't -- i do n't get it			0
@entity80 has to be made			0
and i know that there are people out there that are -- that are trying to , you know , get this change in place			0
and @entity89 and i are committed for the rest of our lives to be a part of that			0
" we need to switch our focus from punishment to prevention			0
our system only kicks into high gear after the fact			0
in this case , a warning sign , something that simple , would have cost a fraction of the millions it might take to prosecute and house the killer			2
a warning sign that a woman had been attacked in the park could have possibly saved @entity8 's life			1
in @entity10 , for every one parole officer there are 70 criminals			0
companies like @entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 use high - tech systems to track packages and information			1
we already have the technology in the form of ankle bracelets to track the sex predators so why not use it ? think about this			2
we can carefully track the delivery of a package across the country but do n't keep track of a sex offender who weighs more than 200 pounds			1
it 's time that we demand the most basic freedom of all , and that is freedom from fear			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			2

@entity139 : @entity1 , 17 , was straight - a student , track star , volunteer
@entity139 : @entity8 killed in a park where a young woman had been attacked earlier
*author* thinks suspect , a sex offender , should have been in jail longer for crime
she writes : if suspect had been in jail , if a sign warned of earlier attack , @entity8 might be alive
