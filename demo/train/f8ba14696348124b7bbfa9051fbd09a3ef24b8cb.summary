@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , one of six adopted children of @entity5 , said through his attorney thursday that he was sexually abused by the former @entity8 assistant football coach , adding that he had been prepared to testify against him in a high - profile child rape case			1
the revelation came on the same day a @entity1 jury began deliberating the fate of @entity5 , who is confronted with accusations of child sexual abuse involving 10 alleged victims			1
jurors deliberated until about 9:30 p.m. thursday			1
they will reconvene friday morning and review testimony from two witnesses			1
@entity3 's accusation could lead to additional charges , including incest , even though he is adopted , according to @entity22 , a @entity23 professor who has represented victims and written on sexual abuse cases			2
" at @entity3 's request , we immediately arranged a meeting between him and the prosecutors and investigators , " attorneys @entity26 and @entity28 said in a statement			0
" this has been an extremely painful experience for @entity3 , and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy			0
" @entity5 , 68 , pleaded not guilty to charges of child sex abuse over a 15 - year period			1
after a week of testimony , jurors will have to decide without having heard from the former @entity8 defensive coordinator on the witness stand			2
during closing arguments , his defense sought to poke holes in the prosecution 's case , pointing to inconsistencies with the testimony of @entity52 , a former graduate student and assistant coach who said he saw @entity5 apparently sodomizing a boy in a university shower			1
defense attorney @entity56 reminded jurors of the lack of physical evidence in the case			2
he accused the alleged victims of conspiring for financial gain while blaming the media for what he described as biased coverage			0
during the arguments , @entity5 's wife , @entity67 , was seen quietly crying			1
what @entity5 has said about child rape allegations lead prosecutor @entity71 followed @entity56 , rebuffing the defense 's account of a coordinated action among @entity5 's accusers allegedly bent on financial windfall			1
" the great thing about conspiracy theories is you just let them go on and on , until they collapse under their own weight , " he said			0
@entity71 described the former coach as a pedophile who systematically preyed on his victims using a charity he founded for troubled children , identifying and repeatedly abusing young boys in his care			0
" the commonwealth has overwhelming evidence against mr. @entity5 , " he said			1
earlier thursday , judge @entity92 announced that three of the counts were dropped against the former coach , bringing the total number of charges to 48			1
he told jurors that all three counts pertain to " alleged victim 4 , " while the defense further petitioned to have all counts related to " alleged victim 8 " dismissed as well			1
@entity92 said one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse duplicated another charge			0
two other counts -- one of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and another of aggravated indecent assault -- were not supported by testimony and the evidence presented , @entity92 found			2
prosecutors dropped one of the original 52 counts earlier this week because the statute on which that charge was based was n't in effect on the date of the alleged incident			1
his accuser said it occurred in 1995 or 1996 , but the unlawful contact with a minor statute did n't apply until 1997			0
the prosecution had called its only rebuttal witness tuesday , to counter testimony that raised questions about @entity5 's mental health			1
all you need to know about allegations , how case unraveled dr. @entity134 testified that he diagnosed @entity5 with histrionic personality disorder , part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders that are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self - images			1
but a second psychologist , prosecution witness dr. @entity142 , disputed those findings , saying that the " personality profile mr. @entity5 exhibited was within normal limits			1
" some court observers had said that if @entity5 were to testify , prosecutors could submit as new evidence a tv interview the ex-coach had with @entity152 sportscaster @entity151			1
in a portion of the interview that was not part of the original november broadcast , @entity5 told @entity151 that he " did n't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that i 've helped			1
" there are likely " many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what i had done for them made a very positive impact on their life , " @entity5 said			1
on wednesday , the defense called dr. @entity166 , an acquaintance of @entity52 's , who told jurors that the former assistant coach told him he heard " sexual sounds " and saw the boy in the shower when an arm reached around him but , did not actually see a sexual encounter			2
@entity5 then emerged from the shower area , he said			1
that account is different from what @entity52 described in his testimony			0
he said that he witnessed @entity5 pressing against the boy in the shower and that it seemed obvious that he had been raping him			1
jurors on thursday told the judge they 'd like to review testimony by @entity52 and @entity166			0
@entity3 's name came up during testimony from one of the alleged victims			0
' the @entity5 8 ' describe seduction , molestation and betrayal the accuser talked about what occurred after he played racquetball once with @entity195 and @entity3			1
" @entity3 went into the shower , and then me and @entity195 came in ... he started pumping his hand full of soap , like he was going to throw it			0
@entity3 got out ... he went to another shower [ area ]			0
" the witness , the first accuser to take the stand , said @entity3 looked " nervous " when he saw that @entity5 was about to start a soap fight			1
according to several of the alleged victims , @entity5 would often use shower " soap fights " as a prelude to inappropriate sexual contact			2
in his 2001 autobiography , " touched , " @entity5 wrote about his relationship with @entity3 , who he met through @entity212 when the youth was 7 or 8			2
" he would visit our house occasionally , but he was never one to get very attached to anyone			0
he would stand off in the corner somewhere and watch as i would be wrestling with the other kids			0
he became an instant challenge for me , " @entity5 wrote			2
" i did n't want to see him go through life by himself at such a young age			0
i did n't want to lose him to whatever other fates might have awaited him , so i kept trying and trying to pull him in			0
" @entity5 detailed the youth 's discipline problems and struggles , ultimately becoming close to his new family			2
" he had the strength and the courage to stay loyal to us even when we were n't sure what would happen , " @entity5 wrote			2
" he could have hurt us			0
he could have driven us out of his life , but he did n't			0
and that will always mean the world to us			0
" meanwhile , a man who claims he was repeatedly sexually abused by @entity3 while a child spoke out thursday			0
" he ( once ) told me if i ever said anything that nobody was going to believe me and he would get my dad fired from @entity8 , " @entity245 , 30 , told @entity152 's " @entity246 with @entity247			0
" @entity245 did not testify in @entity5 's trial , but did file a civil action against the former coach			1
