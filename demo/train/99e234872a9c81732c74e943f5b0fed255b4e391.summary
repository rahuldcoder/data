on wednesday , when @entity2 publisher @entity1 told his staff that he had dismissed executive editor @entity4 , he cited an " issue with management in the newsroom " and said he would n't get into the details			1
on saturday , he concluded that he had to -- and he sent a detailed 475 - word statement to the press that listed @entity4 's shortcomings			1
the unsparing statement came after days of news reports that questioned whether @entity4 was the victim of sexism			1
allies of @entity4 told @entity16 that she had spoken up after finding out that she 'd been paid less than her predecessor in the job , @entity17			2
on saturday , @entity1 acknowledged that her firing had been " cast by many as an example of the unequal treatment of women in the workplace			1
" " rather than accepting that this was a situation involving a specific individual who , as we all do , has strengths and weaknesses , a shallow and factually incorrect storyline has emerged , " @entity1 said			0
he asserted that her total " pay package " -- not just her salary , but stock and other compensation -- " was comparable with @entity17 's ; in fact , by her last full year as executive editor , it was more than 10 percent higher than his			1
" then he listed what he said were the management issues that led him to abruptly replace her with @entity44 , who had been managing editor for news			0
the statement came as a surprise because until saturday , it appeared that both sides had agreed not to speak publicly about her departure			0

" @entity1 said he " warned her " that she " risked losing the trust of both masthead and newsroom " if she did not improve			0
" she acknowledged that there were issues and agreed to try to overcome them			0
" the @entity2 reported earlier this week that @entity4 had retained a consultant to " help her with her management style			1

" he did not specify when this became clear			0
he reportedly met with @entity44 and listened to concerns about @entity4 earlier this month			0
through a spokeswoman , @entity1 declined a followup interview request on saturday			2
@entity4 has not responded to interview requests since wednesday			2
