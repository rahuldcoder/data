people with a gene variant that sharply increases the risk of alzheimer 's disease in old age may show memory impairment earlier than thought -- sometimes well before their 60th birthday , according to new study in the @entity9			1
a variant of the @entity12 gene indicates whether a person has a greater risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
between 20 and 35 percent of @entity15 have one or two copies of this gene variant , inherited from one or both parents			1
people with one copy of the variant , called @entity21 ( @entity12 e4 ) , have a 29 percent lifetime risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , while people who do n't have it have a 9 percent risk			1
people with two copies of @entity12 e4 have an even higher @entity31 's risk , but it 's hard to define the exact percentage as only 2 percent of the population falls into this category			1
despite the gene - related health problems , another study in the same issue of the journal suggests that people who learn they do have @entity12 e4 seem to handle the information pretty well			1
but the researchers excluded people with anxiety or depression , and they followed people for just a year			0
therefore , the results do n't tell the whole story about what it would be like for most people to find out whether they carried the @entity12 e4 gene			1
nevertheless , the findings are an important first step , said dr. @entity56 , a professor of neuroscience at the @entity58 and the codirector of @entity58 's @entity60			0
" i think it opens the door to ask the deeper questions , " said @entity56 , referring to the possible consequences for individuals and society if widespread @entity12 testing were introduced			2
( @entity56 was not involved with either study			0
) if people do find out they have the @entity12 e4 gene , @entity56 added , the new memory study could make the news harder to bear			1
dr. @entity72 , of the @entity73 , in @entity74 , and his colleagues followed 815 people ages 21 to 97 with normal mental function , including 317 who had at least one copy of the @entity12 e4 gene			1
on one test of a person 's ability to learn and remember ( the @entity84 ) gene carriers showed declines in their scores beginning in their 50s			1
for people without the @entity12 e4 gene , this decline started in their 70s			1
" we 're not talking anymore about a retired population ; we 're talking about people who will be in the midst of their career , " @entity72 said			0
he added that many would be in positions of responsibility in which they need to have all their wits about them -- and they may not			0
@entity101 : eat smarter in your 30s , 40s , and 50s " [ the study ] forces us to really think about the brave new world of genetics , " and how this information might be used , @entity56 said			0
although there had been a " clear line " between having the @entity12 e4 gene but being dementia - free and having alzheimer 's disease , that distinction is n't as clear anymore , he explained			1
for someone who discovers he or she has the @entity12 e4 gene , @entity72 said , " the only advice i have is , ' do n't panic			1
' " right now , @entity12 gene testing is only recommended for people with mild problems with mental function or dementia ; for people with no symptoms , it should only be done in a research setting , experts said			1
nevertheless , labs have sprung up that will offer the " worried well " an @entity12 gene test for a fee			1
having @entity12 testing without adequate medical , psychological , or genetic counseling is " inappropriate , " said dr. @entity132 , a professor of neurology and medicine at @entity135 , and the director of the @entity137 at @entity138 -- @entity139 , both in @entity140			2
in these situations , @entity132 explained people may not interpret the results correctly , and could run the risk of psychological harm			0
for example , people who find out they carry the gene for @entity149 's disease -- which means they have a 100 percent chance of developing a devastating neurodegenerative condition if they live long enough -- do indeed experience anxiety , depression , and suicidal thoughts , @entity132 noted			2
@entity101 : fight aging -- the real secrets to staying young in the second study , dr. @entity159 of the @entity160 , and his colleagues in the @entity162 set out to look at whether something similar would happen to people who found out they carried the @entity31 's gene			1
they assigned 162 symptom - free people at random to a group who would receive their @entity12 genotyping results and a group who would not be told their results , and then checked their level of anxiety and depression -- as well as stress related to the gene test -- six weeks , six months , and one year after they got the news ( or did n't )			2
all of the study participants had a parent with @entity31 's disease , but none of them had any signs of mental impairment or dementia			1
people who found out they did n't carry the gene variant were less stressed about the test than those who found out they did carry the gene			2
@entity159 and his team also found that the higher a person scored on initial tests of anxiety and depression symptoms , the more likely he or she was to be anxious or depressed after finding out about the gene , although the researchers had excluded people with severe anxiety or depression from the study			0
however , there were no differences between the groups that were told the news and those who were not			0
the fact that people in the study agreed to be randomly assigned to get their apoe results suggests they " are not representative of those who have a strong perceived need to know or need not to know , " @entity210 and dr. @entity211 of the @entity212 , in @entity213 , wrote in an editorial published with the studies			0
the study also considered only the psychological impact of the news , they say			0
some people might make major life decisions based on the news , such as deciding to hoard their money or spend it all			0
in addition , employers and health insurers are banned from discriminating against someone based on their genes , but companies offering long - term - care insurance , disability insurance , and life insurance are allowed to take this information into account			0
@entity101 : how to get your way with body language one major reason why learning @entity12 e4 status could be so stressful is that there 's no clear way to reduce @entity31 's risk			1
but there could be soon , some experts say			0
" we do n't know yet how by doing interventions whether or not we can beat the @entity12 gene or at least diminish its effects , " said @entity56			2
" we do know that the likelihood of getting alzheimer 's disease is very much affected by people 's exercise level , their blood pressure , their cholesterol levels , perhaps their diet , and the degree to which they engage in cognitive challenges			0
all of those things have data , some stronger than others , that you can have some effect on your likelihood of getting @entity31 's			2
" but , @entity72 points out that trying to encourage people to exercise in order to prevent heart disease , for example , has been far from successful , and getting people to be active to ward off @entity31 may be equally difficult			0
@entity101 : heartburn or heart attack ? how to tell the difference maybe , however , the thought of losing our minds is a bit more motivating than the idea of heart disease			0
" there is some recent evidence to suggest , in fact , that personal knowledge of @entity12 status and general ad risk profile may spur healthy midlife adults to adopt or modify behaviors that might protect against the disease , " @entity132 said			0
@entity101 : 10 risk factors for heart disease @entity296 is a cholesterol - carrying molecule , and the gene that makes the protein comes in three slightly different versions -- e2 , e3 , and e4 ( there 's no e1 )			2
in addition to increasing the risk of alzheimer 's disease , @entity303 is also associated with a greater risk of heart disease			2

having one copy of gene variant , @entity303 , means 29 percent risk of @entity31 's
people with @entity12 e4 gene variant showed declines beginning in their 50s
@entity12 gene testing is only recommended for people with mild mental functions
