-- on wednesday night , an estimated 50 million @entity1 will watch the first presidential debate live , as president @entity3 and @entity5 nominee @entity4 face off for 90 minutes in @entity6			1
the odds are that many of those watching will have more than their tvs on as they do so : millions are also likely to be glancing at their laptops or mobile phones , scanning the live conversation about the debates that will unfold over social networks and chiming in with their own comments			0
but while this burst of online chatter will undoubtedly affect the coverage and analysis of the debates , the bipartisan @entity24 has , unfortunately , taken only the most modest of steps to channel all of this public participation into something more meaningful than a digital water - cooler conversation			1
despite all kinds of interesting experiments during the primaries , including questions from the audience via @entity36 and inviting real - time feedback that moderators occasionally inserted into the live debate conversation , the commission is rolling out a quasi-interactive online tool that is bound to leave the public wanting much more			1
opinion : debate advice -- @entity3 , light a cig ; @entity4 , throw deep a week ago , the debate commission announced " @entity45 ... , " a digital platform that will be deployed on special landing pages hosted by @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 to " give people throughout the country the opportunity to share their voice			1
" now , a day before the first debate , i 've gotten a peek at the dashboard they 're delivering , from the @entity49 page that has just gone live ( the others are still placeholders )			2
" @entity45 of " landing page offers three options : explore the issues , voice your view and watch the debates			2
of those , the second choice is the most intriguing , because it gives participants the ability to not just say where they stand on topics like health care , energy , regulation , education , foreign affairs , terrorism , jobs , taxes and federal spending but to then see how they compare with other participants in the aggregate			0
a dynamic counter will then also show how many people have " shared their voice			2
" this is very nice , and it will certainly be interesting to see how the live debate affects the results on " @entity45 of ... " dashboards			1
but it barely scratches the surface of what the internet could do to open up the debates , engage the public and allow for a more robust and accountable discussion of key issues by the candidates			2
it 's kind of like if the debate commission got itself a synthesizer but just decided to use it to play " @entity106			1
" to most people , " sharing your voice " means actually getting a sense that you are being listened to			2
otherwise , what is the point of having a voice ? unlike broadcast television , the @entity96 is an arena of abundance			0
you do n't need to speak in soundbites online or conduct pnly one - way , top - down conversations			0
opinion : how will debates sway the undecideds ? instead of just creating an online playpen for a parallel but essentially disconnected national conversation about the debates , the commission could have built on work done during the primaries to capture and reflect public responses to the actual candidate responses , in real time			0
or , as @entity135 and @entity136 promised in a little - noticed news release in july , they could also be using the @entity96 to enable the public to " share their input with the debate moderators in advance of the debates			1
" there 's still time for the commission to rethink this approach , but i 'm not holding my breath			0
after all , the dirty little secret about the @entity24 is that is essentially a creature of the two major parties that views its job as managing an orderly joint television appearance that both major presidential campaigns will agree to			1
the real details of how these debates are run are actually hammered out in secret negotiations between top lawyers from both sides , as @entity162 of the advocacy group @entity163 has documented in detail			0
a whistle - blower leaked him the 2004 contract between the @entity168 and @entity169 campaigns that showed that both sides had agreed that the two men would not ask each other direct questions , for example			0
in the town - hall - style debate , they also agreed that " @entity177 members shall not ask follow - up questions or otherwise participate in the extended discussion , and the audience members ' microphone shall be turned off after he or she completes asking the question			0
" if the presidential campaigns can go so far as to prohibit a live audience member in a town - hall - style debate from even asking a follow - up question , which is something that would happen naturally if it was a genuine town hall , then it 's understandable why the commission 's approach to the @entity96 is so compartmentalized and limited			1
but as a new generation of @entity1 who use social media naturally enters public life , this artificial wall between the voters and our would - be leaders will eventually come down			0
opinion : candidates , stop vying to be debate underdog the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity205 .			1

wednesday 's presidential debate will feature limited online interaction
@entity24 created " @entity211 ... " for viewers
tool lets users " share their voice " but not with candidates
