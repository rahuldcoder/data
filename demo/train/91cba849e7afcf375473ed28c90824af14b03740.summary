-- as @entity3 enthusiasts speculate over why pancreatic cancer survivor @entity4 wo n't appear at @entity5 this year , the ceo asks them to think differently about his health			1
@entity3 ceo @entity4 delivered keynote addresses in september 2008 , left , and in october 2005 , right			2
addressing the " @entity9 " in a statement , @entity4 said his doctors think they have found the reason behind his weight loss : " a hormone imbalance that has been ' robbing ' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy			1
sophisticated blood tests have confirmed this diagnosis			0
" but doctors unaffiliated with @entity4 ' care say this " hormone imbalance " could be a symptom of a slew of underlying conditions , including cancer or diabetes			1
however , any diagnosis based on this description and @entity4 ' cancer history is purely speculative , experts say			2
based on @entity4 ' history of gastrointestinal problems , it 's possible his gastrointestinal system either is n't absorbing proteins or is losing proteins , said dr. @entity35 , director of endocrinology at @entity36 in @entity37 , who is not involved in caring for @entity4			0
" i suspect he 's referring to his gastrointestinal system and some of the hormones related to that , rather than more classic endocrine hormones , " which are associated with the thyroid , adrenal or pituitary glands , @entity35 said			1
while abnormalities related to those hormones may also lead to weight loss , they are not necessarily associated with pancreatic disease , he said			1
there is not enough information available to say how severe a gastrointestinal hormonal problem would be , he said			0
others speculate the hormonal issue could relate to his cancer			0
dr. @entity55 , clinical professor at @entity56 , said a tumor in the pancreas would typically create an overproduction of hormones			0
@entity61 , a hormone produced in the pancreas , would lead to weight loss if produced in excess			1
" in a patient whom a few years ago had pancreatic cancer , then progressive weight loss , then develops complications from the weight loss , it would be logical to associate his symptoms now with the previous cancer , " he said			1
but the weight loss is not necessarily cancer - related , and @entity4 ' statement suggests that it 's not , said dr. @entity77 , chief of the division of surgical oncology at the @entity81 's @entity80			1
plenty of hormonal conditions , as well as diabetes related to cancer treatment , could be the reason , he said			1
@entity4 , who co-founded @entity3 , first learned he had pancreatic cancer in october 2003			2
he had been getting abdominal scans because of a history of intestinal problems , and a tumor appeared on one of them , @entity88 reported last year			0
the growth was an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor , a rare form of pancreatic cancer that is operable , @entity88 reported			0
while @entity4 initially wanted to treat the tumor with a special diet and alternative therapies , he finally underwent a @entity102 procedure , a painful but relatively safe operation , in july 2004 , @entity88 reported			0
if @entity4 had a recurrence of this tumor , and it was a functional neuroendocrine tumor , which produces problem - causing hormones , that would be one speculative explanation , @entity77 said			2
but not enough information is available to say whether the tumor was the functional kind , he said			0
" is it possible that a cancer recurrence would result in weight loss ? of course			1
he 's saying that 's not what he has , and so , i have to take him at his word			0
none of us know the truth except his doctors , " @entity77 said			0
rumors about @entity4 ' declining health have been circulating for months , as his weight visibly dropped from one public appearance to the next			2
while @entity4 ' keynote address at the @entity5 is usually the highlight of the @entity3 fan gathering , @entity3 announced in december @entity4 would not appear this year and the company would no longer participate in the event after 2009			1
@entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

doctors : @entity4 ' " hormone imbalance " could refer to several health conditions
cancer recurrence could explain weight loss
hormonal imbalance related to thyroid , pituitary or adrenal glands also possible
jobs will not appear at @entity5 this year
