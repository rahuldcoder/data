@entity0 -- conjoined twin girls -- each with a fully developed skull , but sharing one body -- have been born in @entity5 , according to their father , who said the babies are suffering from a host of health problems			1
" the doctor said they are in critical condition , " father @entity10 told @entity1 by telephone , as his babies cried in the background in a hospital intensive care unit			1
" the girls suffer from more than 10 illnesses right now and their chance for survival is very low			2
" but he said the girls -- affectionately dubbed " @entity25 sister " and " right sister " by their parents -- bring the new mother and father much joy			1
" they cry at the same time , they sleep at the same time and they wake up together , and sometimes their hands wiggle in the air , grabbing for each other 's hand , " @entity10 said			1
" it 's very cute			0
" the babies were born may 5 in @entity5 's southwest @entity41 province , in the small city of @entity43			0
they share one trunk , one pelvis , one spleen , one gallbladder and one reproductive system			0
initial x-rays show they have two spines , two esophagi , two stomachs , two sets of lungs and two separate nervous systems			0
the babies have been moved from @entity43 to @entity57 in the city of @entity59 for further examination			0
the hospital has classified them as " high risk , " as they suffer from conditions including anemia , pneumonia , jaundice and neonatal sepsis			0
@entity10 said doctors have said they can not rule out epilepsy or cerebral palsy			1
@entity5 's state - run @entity71 news agency reported wednesday that the babies ' combined weight is about 4 kilograms ( 8 pounds )			0
@entity57 has successfully separated four pairs of conjoined twins , according to @entity71			2
however , doctors said the twins may not need immediate separation surgery as long as they can grow in a healthy way , @entity71 reported			1
and @entity10 said doctors told him that a separation surgery would be impossible , since the babies share one - and - a - half hearts , and that the structure of their trunk is not conducive to a surgery that either child would survive			1
" i am very worried , " @entity10 said			1
his wife remains hospitalized in @entity43 as she recovers from the birth , he said , and calls constantly to hear her daughters and receive updates on their condition			0
preliminary imaging results have showed the babies ' two skulls are fully developed and have normal facial features , according to state - run media			0
the couple had had several health checks , beginning six months ago , and believed they were having one healthy child			2
at a final pregnancy examination three days before birth , doctors told the parents they were having " one baby with two heads , " @entity10 said			1
the parents did not know the sex of the babies			2
scanning to determine the sex of a baby in @entity5 is illegal , a rule designed to prevent sex - selective abortions			0
@entity10 said the parents were shocked by the news but moved forward with the birth			1
@entity10 said he worked as a cook in @entity117 before the babies were born , and his wife was a factory worker for a cotton clothing manufacturer before she returned to @entity43			1
the cost of the babies ' care far outpaces the couple 's modest income , so hospitals and social service organizations in @entity43 have stepped in to help foot the bills			1
" the hospitals have never asked us for money , " @entity10 said			1
" medical experts from across @entity5 are flying in to help us			0
" he said he hopes the babies , along with his wife , will recover			0
" the girls are different than the other children because they have two heads , " he said			2
" their health conditions are poor			2
( but ) we hope that since they were born to us , in this world , that they can live their lives as they were meant to do			0
