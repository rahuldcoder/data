@entity0 -- remember when @entity2 was hot ? @entity3 , who manages the group responsible for @entity6 's web - based e-mail service , can still recall the day of celebration in 2004 when the @entity2 division had just posted a stunning financial quarter			1
@entity3 , along with other @entity6 execs and developers , convened to relish in the victory			2
the triumph was short - lived because soon after , @entity14 launched a competing webmail service called @entity16 , and like in the short time it takes @entity14 to call up a search query , @entity2 instantly looked dated			1
@entity16 gave users a gigabyte of file storage for free , while @entity2 presented a few megabytes and required users to pay for more			2
@entity16 was fast , spam - free and let people attach files several times larger than that of @entity2			1
and @entity16 only showed small text advertisements , while @entity2 's pages were covered in ads , which is why the site was able to exceed financial goals during that quarter in 2004			2
after evaluating the options , " it was n't hard to pick @entity16 ; it just was n't hard , " @entity3 said in an interview on monday			0
" it was a great learning experience about what really matters			0
" after a few years of lightning - fast growth for @entity16 following its launch and at the expense of @entity2 , @entity6 reversed course			1
" we set out to really invest in @entity2 and really , to rebuild it from the ground up , " said @entity40 , a vice president who oversees several of @entity6 's internet applications			1
the @entity2 team eventually got the green light to dial down the ads while increasing development on features made available to nonpaying users			2
making money directly from @entity2 " is not the most important thing for us to optimize for , " @entity40 said in an interview			2
" the lesson from some of the most successful @entity56 companies is they build something valuable and durable			0
" that is a notion , @entity40 said , that @entity6 learned from a rival , @entity14 , and from a partner , @entity62			1
it is not conventional wisdom for @entity6 , which makes most of its revenue from software sold for hundreds of dollars a package in brick - and - mortar stores			1
the people who write the history of technology tend to take shortcuts			0
accounts of @entity73 's , @entity74 's and @entity76 's fall from grace are often summed up as : they just stopped being cool			0
in fact , they were less reliable and less capable than their scrappier competition			0
the same was true of @entity2 , but @entity6 is fighting back			1
the @entity83 , @entity84 , company gathered reporters together here at an art gallery in @entity0 on monday to show powerpoint slides that demonstrate how @entity2 is just as feature - rich , if not more so , than @entity16			1
@entity6 is putting muscle behind features such as granular controls over daily - deal messages and newsletters , automatic filtering and various new functions that launch in the next few weeks			1
these changes are already being touted to current users of @entity6 's e-mail service in a banner that urges them to look out for " the new @entity2			1
" it 's a part of a campaign to improve the brand 's image , so that people are n't embarrassed to say their e-mail address ends in @ hotmail.com			0
" for a lot of folks , @entity2 was their first @entity110 address , " @entity40 said			0
" now the challenge that we 're fighting , frankly , is mostly one of perception			0
" @entity2 still holds the highest market share worldwide , followed by @entity116 and then @entity16 , according to research firm @entity117			0
in the @entity119 , @entity118 is the leader , and this year , @entity16 surpassed @entity2 and maintains faster growth , @entity117 says			0
the options for free e-mail are poised to increase , with other tech giants making bids for the space that follows your name and the " at " symbol			0
@entity130 will discuss its @entity132 service at a news conference on tuesday , which is the first time the company will give out free e-mail access , in this case , an @ me.com address , to customers			1
@entity62 recently gave each of its 800 million users an @ facebook.com alias , but few people seem eager to use them			0
@entity6 is hoping to regain some cool in the hopes of hanging onto the friends it still has -- and to make new ones , before the new kids take over the block .			2

@entity6 is hoping to improve the reputation of @entity2
the web - based e-mail service , once a *dominant* *player* , is *losing* steam
@entity2 faces a growing list of competitors , *including* @entity130 , @entity62 , @entity14
