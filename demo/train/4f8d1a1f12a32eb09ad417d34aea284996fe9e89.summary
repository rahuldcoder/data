@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 may look like your average 35 - year - old @entity1			1
he 's dark , clean - shaven , slightly chubby and wears glasses			2
there 's nothing in his appearance that hints at his @entity12 identity , save for the prayer mark on his forehead			1
@entity15 is , in fact , an active member of the @entity17 -- @entity0 's largest opposition movement , which was banned from politics under the former regime of @entity21			1
@entity15 is a lawyer who specializes in human rights cases and also a member of a youth coalition that comprises young @entity0 revolutionaries of varied ideologies			1
the young members of the coalition are united by a single goal : ensuring @entity0 's transition to a civil democratic state			1
more than four months after @entity21 was forced from office in mass uprisings that erupted january 25 , @entity15 and other young @entity17 members say they are feeling increasingly alienated from the @entity12 organization that shaped their political beliefs and influenced their behavior for most of their lives			1
" we are not in agreement with all of the principles adopted by the older members of the group , " @entity15 acknowledged recently over espressos at @entity41 's , a tea room in downtown @entity1			1
" our motives are different ... we have @entity0 's best interests at heart			1
" prior to this year 's mass protests that swept across @entity0 , it was rare to hear a younger member of the @entity17 openly criticize the group 's elder leaders			1
@entity15 's statements suggest a possible split within the ranks of @entity0 's most organized political movement			1
behind the rift is support from younger members for @entity63 -- a former member of the @entity17 who has announced his candidacy in the upcoming presidential election			1
the movement 's older leaders had ruled out fielding a candidate in the presidential vote and have responded by blacklisting @entity63			2
their decision to stay out of the presidential race , however , does not mean they lack political ambition			2
in statements to the news media made after @entity21 was forced from office in february , @entity74 , a senior @entity17 leader , declared that the group would seek 35 % of the seats in @entity80			2
but that was before the @entity82 scored a victory in the march referendum vote for proposed constitutional amendments			0
the result of the referendum was a resounding 77 % favoring a yes vote			0
that outcome fueled the political ambitions of the @entity82 , who had warned voters that a no vote would have been " un-islamic			0
" after the results were announced , @entity17 leaders declared their intentions to compete for around 50 % of parliamentary seats in the upcoming election			0
but the vote was a blow to the secularists and pro-democracy activists who had hoped to garner support for the drafting of a new constitution to replace the old one			0
fearing a rise in political islam , they have called for delaying the legislative election to allow more time for new political movements to organize			0
activists fear that , if the vote is held in two months as planned , the @entity17 and remnants of @entity21 's @entity116 , as the country 's only organized parties , would dominate the lower house of @entity80 , called the @entity118			0
calls to postpone the election have gone unheeded and the ruling @entity122 has announced that the vote will be held as scheduled			0
despite growing concerns among some analysts that the @entity82 are gaining ground , others remain confident that the group is unlikely to win more than 20 % of the seats in parliament			0
activist @entity130 pointed to the schisms within the @entity17 and noted that the situation today differs greatly from what it was like during the election six years ago			0
" in the 2005 election , disgruntled voters had flocked to the ballot box to vote @entity116 members out , " he said			2
running as independents , the @entity82 won a fifth of the seats in parliament in the 2005 election			0
" but , the @entity17 has now lost the ' @entity143 ' votes , " @entity130 said			0
on the streets of @entity1 , similar views were expressed by residents , including those in poor neighborhoods like @entity149 and @entity150 , where the @entity17 has been most active , offering a range of much - needed social services			2
" i will certainly vote in the next legislative election , but my vote wo n't go to the @entity82 , " said @entity153 , a mechanic in @entity149 's working - class district			2
" all they are after is a power grab			0
" " the loyalty of the @entity17 lies with @entity161 in @entity162 and @entity163 in @entity164 ; they do n't really care much about the welfare of this country , " said @entity159 , a bearded , 56 - year - old taxi driver			1
" no one knows what their agenda really is , " he added			0
outlining the @entity17 's vision for a " new @entity0 , " @entity74 said the group wants a civil democratic state with laws drawn from @entity82 shariah law			1
" @entity0 is a predominantly @entity17 country , but we have @entity177 too living in our midst ; it is their country too , " he said			1
it is therefore not surprising that the new political party launched by the @entity17 under the name " @entity184 " is open to @entity177 -- and to women			0
the @entity122 now running the country has made it clear that no party will be allowed to run along religious lines			0
in a surprise move , the @entity191 administration this week announced it would open a dialogue with the @entity17 , saying that " it is in the interests of the @entity196 to engage with all parties that are committed to non-violence and that intend to compete for the parliament and the presidency			0
" @entity201 , a spokesman for the @entity12 group , said the @entity196 " must first respect the people 's choices for a true democracy , independence and respect their choice of leaders			1
we would welcome the open dialogue , if they are serious and transparent			0
" meanwhile , @entity15 and at least 20 other young members of the @entity17 have teamed up with other young activists espousing different ideologies to launch their own political party , " @entity216 , " a move that risks their expulsion from the @entity219			1
@entity220 , the @entity17 secretary general , has said that any @entity17 members who join competing political parties will be penalized			2
" @entity225 are banned from joining any party except the @entity17 's own @entity227 , " he recently told the independent @entity224 newspaper			0
@entity15 said he regrets the move by @entity17 leadership to ostracize him and insisted that the new party he has helped to establish will work toward fulfilling the goals of the revolution			1
among its priorities will be ending corruption and social injustice , eradicating poverty and increasing civil liberties -- demands made by opposition activists during 18 days of protest in @entity242 this year			2
@entity15 , who has worked with other young activists in the 25 january youth coalition to chart a way toward a successful transition to democracy , said he hopes to use the experience to help build the new @entity0			1
" there 's a lot of work to be done and @entity0 must come first , " he said .			2

youth coalition seeks to help @entity0 transition to a civil democratic state
some younger members say they feel *isolated* from the @entity12 organization
" our motives are different , " says 35 - year - old @entity15
