on july 17 , 1996 , @entity0 took off from @entity1 headed for @entity2			1
just 12 minutes later , it exploded over the shores of @entity5 , @entity6			2
there were 230 people on board , and no one survived			1
many eyewitnesses described seeing something heading toward the plane before it exploded , and the suspicion of terrorism was almost instant			2
the biggest investigation in aviation history , at that time , ensued			1
the government spent four years and millions of dollars in that investigation and 18 years later , many still question whether they got it right			1
with that in mind , here are five surprising things you probably did n't know about the investigation , including one big thing the investigators themselves still do n't know : 1			1

@entity123 and @entity124 were suspects			0
beyond terrorist groups being suspected , state - sponsored terrorism was also cause for concern inside the @entity129			2
@entity130 , former secretary of defense and former @entity132 director , was chief of staff for president @entity134 at the time of the crash			0
" the investigation was looking at almost every possibility , including state actors , because we 'd known that @entity65 had been involved with regards to bringing down the airliner over @entity61 ( @entity143 103 ) " , said @entity130			2
" we were looking at @entity144 and @entity124			0

the @entity173 said a spark in a fuel tank led to the explosion in november 1997 , more than a year after the crash , the @entity29 announced that a criminal act did not bring down the ill - fated plane			1
at that point , it was up to the @entity173 to figure out the cause of the explosion			0
a full four years after the crash of @entity0 , the @entity173 released its official report : it found the probable cause of the accident was a spark in the center fuel tank that eventually led to the explosion that brought down the aircraft			1
while they offered their best theory on where the spark came from , they never found a definitive answer			0
