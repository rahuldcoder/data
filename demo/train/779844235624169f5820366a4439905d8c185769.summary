" live every week like it 's @entity1			1
" those immortal words come not from the @entity4 's marketing department but from @entity5 on " @entity6			1
" believe it or not , there once was a time when there was no @entity1			0
it was n't until famed oceanographer @entity13 's 1956 documentary , " @entity18 , " that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like			1
" @entity13 changed the way ocean exploration was done , " said @entity19 , who along with partner @entity20 is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration			1
@entity13 " invited people to explore along with him , and so for us it 's the same thing , " said @entity20			2
their invention , called an @entity34 , is a submarine - like robot that you control with your laptop			1
it gives scientists , explorers and other users a glimpse of what lies below the surface , without them getting wet			0
" @entity46 stands for remotely operated vehicle " @entity19 said			2
" it 's got a video camera on it , so you can see what it sees live			1
so i can put this in the water , fly it around and see what it sees			0
" the @entity34 is about the size of a toaster and is engineered to go to depths of up to 100 meters			1
underwater rovs have been used for research for years			2
but the biggest difference between the @entity34 and the one , say , @entity67 uses , is the price			1
the @entity34 sells for $ 849			1
it 's not what everyone would call cheap , but you do n't need a grant to get your hands on one			2
this affordability is how @entity19 and @entity20 hope to bring @entity34 to the masses , turning average people into @entity13 - like undersea adventurers			1
plan for a new kind of spy plane " if you think about ocean exploration right now , it 's something that a lot of people think , ' oh , well , you know , what that 's something that professional scientists do , that @entity91 explorers do			1
that 's not something that i get to do , ' " @entity20 said , " i think that 's what we 're trying to instill back in everyone			1
" the two met when @entity19 was interning with @entity100 and @entity20 was between jobs , and both immediately bonded over the idea of a new way to explore the ocean			0
" when we first met almost three years ago ... within 10 minutes @entity19 told me a story about this underwater cave , " @entity20 said			2
" within a half an hour we were talking about , ' well , what if we could build an underwater robot that could go and roam the ocean and anyone could go on and control it from the @entity115 ? " the project started in their garage in @entity119 , @entity120 -- home to some other famous tech innovators : @entity122			1
but once they turned to @entity125 last year , they saw how many people were truly interested in taking the plunge			0
" we set a goal for $ 20,000 and ended up raising that in about two hours , which is really exciting , " @entity20 said			2
" it 's fun to watch the kind of dollar amounts go up , but then you quickly realize , ' @entity132 , we have to build all these things			2
' " there are over 500 @entity139 in use now around the globe			0
even though the project is growing , @entity19 and @entity20 are sticking with their do - it - yourself ethos			0
the @entity139 are an open - source project , meaning that anyone can hack them to create new features or uses for the devices			2
@entity20 and @entity19 sell the @entity151 as kits , and customers put them together themselves			0
meet your friendly neighborhood drones it 's a process that helps get everyone involved in the production and design aspect			2
" we have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better , " @entity19 said			0
among those interested in @entity139 are conservation groups who want to check on invasive fish species and teachers who want to use them in the classroom , @entity20 said			0
building a community of users to provide input is another way the @entity34 is unique			1
it also explains the first half of the name			0
" @entity34 is an open - source community , " @entity19 said			1
" if the @entity151 is having some sort of a problem and we ca n't figure out how to handle it , i can go onto the forums and post , ' hey , this is a problem i 'm having , ' and as i sleep , the problem is going across @entity188 and people who are experts are answering it because they find it interesting			0
" by the time i wake up , it 's going to cross the @entity194 , and by lunch i can have five or six good solutions			0
" with a flow of new ideas coming in from all over the world , @entity19 and @entity20 have decided not to get a patent for the @entity34 -- at least not yet			1
this makes it easier for them to upgrade with new tech and designs			0
" for us , we want to innovate as quickly as possible			0
we want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design , " said @entity19			1
" we 've been designing the @entity151 around parts that are not even in existence yet , but that we know are emerging			0
" as the @entity34 evolves and improves , this approach may allow for more exploration in uncharted waters			1
" people often ask , ' is it something that 's just kind of a toy that 's fun to build and play with , or is it something that you expect to be used by real researchers ? ' and our answer certainly is , ' both , ' " @entity19 said			0
@entity13 would certainly be proud .			0

a new submersible robot -- sort of an underwater drone -- could open up undersea exploration
the @entity34 can be controlled remotely with a laptop
it 's *equipped* with a video camera to stream back images
the device was designed in @entity232 and sells for $ 849
