-- a controversial @entity2 senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by @entity6 guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year 's @entity7 , which will be announced friday , said an independent research institute in @entity9			1
sen. @entity10 , right , of @entity2 reportedly is one of three top contenders for the @entity7			1
sen. @entity10 is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders , said the @entity14 - based @entity13			1
the others the institute named are @entity18 prince @entity17 , a philosophy professor in @entity20 faith at @entity21 , and @entity23 physician and human rights activist @entity24			1
though the institute considers @entity28 the front - runner , no single candidate has emerged as the clear - cut favorite , as sometimes happens , said @entity30 , director of the peace institute			1
" it really is quite open this year , " @entity30 said			0
this year 's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations			2
the committee does not release the names of the nominees			0
the 50 - year - old peace institute , which is often called @entity40 , has no connection with the @entity36 that awards the peace prize			1
@entity30 said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict			2
" this is a [ @entity36 ] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments , " he said			0
@entity10 , 54 , heads @entity54 , a group trying to end to the 45 - year - old war between the government and the guerrilla @entity58 , known as the @entity58			2
since 2007 , she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the @entity58 and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more			0
@entity2 officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives			1
a government critic and longtime peace activist , @entity10 was kidnapped by a right - wing paramilitary group in 1999			1
she was released after several weeks and then fled to @entity70 with her family , where she stayed for 14 months before returning home			0
there have been at least two assassinations attempts against her			0
" while it is the hostage releases that have brought @entity28 and her organization the most attention , her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long - term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the @entity7 , " @entity40 said in a release			1
@entity30 said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about @entity10 , whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels			0
" i do realize that this created some debate in @entity2 , " he said			1
" that 's not terribly surprising			0
" @entity10 was nominated by @entity93 human rights activist @entity92 , winner of the 1980 @entity7			1
@entity30 said @entity17 , an @entity20 scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths , also is a leading candidate			2
" certainly , the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong , " @entity30 said			0
a member of the @entity18 royal family and educated at @entity103 and @entity104 universities , where he received a doctorate , @entity17 , 42 , " is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue , " @entity40 said			1
in 2005 , the prince brought together 170 @entity20 scholars from 40 countries for the @entity109 to work out what they called a " theological counter-attack against terrorism			2
" two years later , @entity17 and other prominent @entity20 scholars wrote a letter called " @entity115 " that urged mutual understanding and peace with @entity118			0
the letter , @entity40 said , was partly a response to pope @entity120 's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on @entity20			0
backing his words with his deeds , @entity17 gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited @entity18 this year			1
" the importance of prince @entity17 's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages @entity20 theology , institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between @entity20 and other faiths , thereby contributing a wider platform for interreligious dialogue for @entity139 in general , " @entity40 said			2
" a prize to @entity17 would also be recognition of the long - standing efforts of the @entity18 royal family , including @entity143 , who have been long - standing proponents of peace and reconciliation in the @entity147			1
" if @entity17 does not win , @entity30 said , it could be because his work is not done			0
" he still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact , " @entity30 said			0
the third @entity40 front - runner is @entity24 , head of the @entity154 and the @entity156 special envoy to @entity157 in @entity158			2
a medical doctor , @entity24 also established the @entity160 , which focuses on health care , particularly for @entity23 women			1
after obtaining her medical degree in 1982 , @entity24 and her son fled to @entity165 in 1984 when the communist regime then ruling @entity23 arrested her husband			1
@entity24 , 52 , remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women 's affairs minister in @entity23 president @entity171 's transitional administration			1
" she has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from @entity181 radicals , and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women , " @entity40 said , adding that she " does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process			2
" according to other published reports , another possible pick is monk @entity186 , head of the outlawed @entity187			2
he has been under house arrest since 2001 and has been in and out of jail since his first detention by communist authorities in 1977			0
@entity186 , 80 , was awarded the annual human rights prize by the @entity193 of @entity9 in 2006			1
four recent @entity195 winners have gone on to garner the @entity7 : @entity196 of @entity197 ( also known as @entity197 ) , @entity198 of @entity199 , @entity200 of @entity201 and @entity202 of @entity203			1
@entity205 journalist and human rights activist @entity204 was awarded the @entity207 this year and also is considered a possible @entity209 winner			1
@entity212 dissidents @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 also are contenders , other observers said			1
after months of house arrest , @entity218 , 36 , was detained in december 2007 during a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in april 2008 for " inciting subversion of state power			2
" @entity218 started his activism focusing on hiv / aids in 2001 and co-founded a grassroots organization dedicated to helping children from @entity224 families			0
the international human rights group @entity228 said @entity218 's focus broadened and he began reporting on a wider human rights violations in @entity212 , even giving interviews to international journalists			1
@entity228 said @entity218 has been repeatedly beaten and harassed by police for his outspokenness			0
before being arrested , he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in @entity237			0
@entity214 , who was born in 1966 , is a self - taught lawyer and @entity239 veteran who was a @entity7 candidate last year			1
he disappeared in february after being taken away by @entity212 police			1
fellow activists say he is believed to still be alive			0
in 2007 , he wrote a letter to the @entity243 urging the @entity244 to boycott the @entity245 held in @entity237 the following year			0
in it , he described a wide array of human rights violations by the @entity212 government -- from lack of property and religious rights to environmental disasters to @entity254			1
" i ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality , justice , and humanity , as well as to what extent such values are undermined in @entity212 , " he said			2
@entity215 , 59 , was first arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years			0
he was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years			0
in 1997 , @entity212 authorities put him on a plane to the @entity244 , where he has lived since			2
perhaps the best known of the @entity212 dissidents , @entity215 has been awarded the @entity266 , the @entity268 's @entity267 , the @entity269 and the @entity270			1
he has been nominated seven times for the peace prize			0
@entity30 said he doubts the @entity36 committee will choose any @entity212 or @entity275 dissidents this year because they " do n't want to anger powerful governments			1
" " although the committee takes pride in being independent , " he said , " there are certain limitations on their being independent			0
" that does not mean he does n't expect the committee to " take daring decisions			0
" @entity30 said he believes that " the most likely expression of the committee 's courage this year will be to award the prize either to an unconventional kind of candidate or to somebody whose work is likely to be directly helped by a prize award			2
" the peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the @entity293 in @entity294 , @entity295			2
the other four prizes are for physiology or medicine , physics , chemistry and literature			0
starting in 1969 , the @entity302 also has been awarded			0
while the other prizes are awarded by committees based in @entity295 , the peace prize is determined by a five - member panel appointed by the @entity9 parliament			1
the @entity36 recipient receives a prize of 10 million @entity295 crowns , or about $ 1.4 million			0
@entity0 's @entity312 contributed to this report .			0
