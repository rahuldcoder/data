-- republicans appeared to have regained the majority of @entity3 governorships tuesday night , capturing 10 in states where the previous executives were @entity6 , according to @entity0 projections of exit poll data			1
but @entity6 scored two takeaways , including in @entity10 , where @entity0 projected that @entity11 will defeat @entity13 @entity12 for the governorship now held by @entity13 @entity15 , who is stepping down under term limits			1
@entity11 returns to the governor 's mansion in @entity10 28 years after his last term ended			2
the other takeaway state was @entity21			2
@entity13 women made major inroads , as @entity25 's @entity24 , @entity27 's @entity26 and @entity29 's @entity28 all defeated their @entity6 opponents			1
a widely publicized battle in @entity32 ended with a projected @entity6 victory as state attorney general @entity34 slid past @entity13 favorite @entity35 , according to @entity0 analysis of exit poll data			1
son of former gov. @entity39 , the younger @entity34 squared off against @entity35 , a businessman and developer , after the @entity42 - endorsed candidate scored an upset victory over former rep. @entity44 earlier in the @entity13 primary			1
@entity34 added to @entity6 wins in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , according to the projections			2

republicans , however , lost @entity63			0
but @entity6 did n't win it either			2
that 's because @entity66 , a former @entity13 , was projected by @entity0 to defeat @entity13 @entity67 and @entity60 @entity68 for the governorship , which had been vacated by @entity70 gov. @entity70 because of term limits			1
@entity66 becomes @entity63 's first governor since 1857 who is neither a @entity13 nor a @entity60			2
often overshadowed during midterm campaigns , governorships can impact national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates			0
republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships tuesday for a majority nationally			0
if the eight - state pickup margin holds , the @entity13 will have gained a national gubernatorial majority plus five			2
@entity53 became the first @entity13 pickup tuesday evening , when @entity88 mayor @entity87 edged past @entity60 @entity89			2
@entity87 will succeed @entity6 gov. @entity90 , who was precluded from running again by term limits			2

addressing her cheering supporters tuesday night , @entity24 hit repeatedly on one theme : " you were the ones telling me how desperately we needed to move @entity25 in a new direction , " she said			1
" at the end of the day , @entity25 chose a new direction			0
" in @entity27 , @entity26 became the state 's first female governor by defeating @entity6 opponent @entity132 in a tightly contested race			1
@entity26 , a 38 - year - old state representative , is supported by former @entity135 gov. @entity134 and @entity42 activists , and has promised to tackle unemployment and excess government spending by way of a 10 - year plan			1
during a bitter campaign run - up , @entity132 hammered @entity26 on reports of late tax payments while campaigning on the scandal surrounding the former governor			0
