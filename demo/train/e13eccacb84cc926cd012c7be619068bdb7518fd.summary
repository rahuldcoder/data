-- @entity2 's season has turned upside down after the club 's first home league defeat in 25 matches , says " concerned " coach @entity6			1
the @entity8 champions face the prospect of losing the outright lead after a record 59 - game run at the top following saturday 's shock 3 - 2 defeat by @entity15 , in which key defender @entity16 was sent off against his former team			1
it left @entity2 level on points with second - placed @entity21 , which hosts fourth - placed @entity22 on sunday			1
longtime rival @entity23 , meanwhile , can move two points above the @entity26 team with victory at sixth - placed @entity28			2
" now we 're playing in a completely different competition , " @entity29 said on @entity2 's website			1
" we will try to regain the ground that we will most likely lose this weekend			0
we still have to play against our direct rivals			0
" i 'm concerned and i want to bounce back from this as soon as possible			0
" @entity2 led through @entity36 but @entity37 and @entity38 put midtable @entity15 head with goals either side of halftime			2
@entity43 leveled with his first @entity45 goal in four months when a penalty was awarded despite the ball appearing to hit @entity48 in the shoulder , not his arm , but @entity51 restored the lead in the 59th minute before fullback @entity53 collected his second booking			0
it was @entity2 's first league defeat at @entity57 since april 2012 , and only second in 22 league matches this season , leaving @entity6 disconsolate			1
" we had the impression that the match was over after half an hour and we paid for that			0
i said that we will pay for our errors , and we committed errors today , " said the @entity63 , in his first season in charge			0
" any error from now on out could cost us dearly			0
their goal at the end of the first half hurt us and we lost confidence			0
their second goal made us desperate			0
" @entity2 will next play seventh - placed @entity78 , which conceded two late goals in a 3 - 2 defeat that eased @entity82 's relegation fears			1
former @entity84 winger @entity83 scored the winning home side 's first from the penalty and then the 83rd - minute decider			2
in saturday 's other games , there were 0 - 0 draws in the games between @entity91 and @entity92 , and @entity93 vs. @entity94 -- which left all four clubs in the bottom half of the table			1
in @entity99 , fourth - placed @entity98 will likely lose ground on the top @entity102 teams following a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity104			2
leader @entity105 plays fifth - placed @entity107 on sunday , while closest rival @entity108 hosts @entity109 and @entity110 travels to @entity111			2
ninth - placed @entity112 came from behind to draw 1 - 1 at home to fellow @entity116 qualification hopeful @entity114 as loan defender @entity117 equalized , a result which ended new coach @entity120 's run of two successive wins			1
meanwhile , @entity122 moved away from the relegation zone with a 2 - 0 win at @entity125			0
in @entity127 , second - placed @entity126 ended a run of three losses by beating @entity130 2 - 1 at home			2
@entity133 international striker @entity132 headed a late winner as @entity126 closed to within 10 points of leader @entity136 , which hosts @entity138 on sunday			0
@entity126 moved four points ahead of third - placed @entity140 , which won 2 - 1 at bottom club @entity141 on friday			0
@entity142 moved up to fourth after beating 10 - man @entity143 2 - 1 with a late winner from midfielder @entity145 , while @entity146 dropped to fifth following a 3 - 1 loss at @entity148			1
in @entity150 , second - placed @entity149 could only draw 2 - 2 at @entity151 -- meaning next weekend 's top - of - the - table clash with @entity153 becomes even more important			1
champions @entity153 hold a five - point advantage following friday 's 2 - 0 win at home to @entity158 , and it could have been even more if @entity159 had not scored a late leveler for @entity149 .			1

coach @entity29 admits " concern " following end of @entity2 's *unbeaten* home run
@entity8 champions could lose @entity8 league lead for the first time in *60* matches
