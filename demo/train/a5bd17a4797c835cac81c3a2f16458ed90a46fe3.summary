@entity0 and @entity2 saw their son growing distant for months			1
but they say they did n't realize what was happening -- until it was too late			2
" for the past few months , he was very quiet and he wanted isolation because he was watching or doing something on social media			1
and that 's why he was brainwashed , " @entity13 said in an exclusive interview with @entity1 's " @entity15 " thursday			1
now @entity17 , 19 , is accused of trying to support @entity18			1
this week he pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization			2
outside the courtroom in @entity24 , his mother told reporters she had a message for the terror group 's leader : " leave our children alone			2
" " they 're misusing the children 's innocence , " @entity13 told @entity1 's @entity30 thursday			2
" the children are gullible			0
their thinking skills have not completely developed and these people are preying on that			0
" @entity18 , an extremist @entity39 group , has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in @entity42 and @entity43 , where it wants to establish a caliphate or @entity46 state			1
the group regularly uses social media to promote its goals , posting videos of brutal violence and using hashtags for other stories in the news to disseminate its message			1
authorities arrested @entity56 at @entity57 in october as he was about to embark on a flight to @entity59			0
in a letter he left behind for his parents , he wrote that he was leaving the @entity62 and on his way to join @entity18 , according to a criminal complaint			1
he invited them to join him in the " @entity66 , " but he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans			0
the letter shocked them , his mother said			0
" the things in those letters did not reflect the upbringing they got			0
those values , they do n't come from us			0
it was so out of sync			0
it was so out of place , " she said			0
@entity83 , the teen 's attorney , said the case was a sign of " nothing but immaturity			1
" " there are thousands of kids doing this , and i think that 's part of the point , what 's causing them to do it ? i do n't believe , in my client 's case , it 's because he 's a violent person and wants to go kill people , " @entity83 said			2
" i think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media			1
" during questioning at the airport , @entity56 told @entity106 agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in @entity59 , federal authorities said in october			0
that person , @entity2 allegedly told the agents , was to take him to @entity18 territory			1
according to the complaint , @entity2 told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service -- like a police force -- or providing humanitarian work or in a combat role			0
@entity18 has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe , including from the @entity62 and @entity121			1
@entity122 , the complaint notes , is a common transit point for foreign fighters from @entity121 countries who travel to join @entity18			1
if it were n't for the @entity130 , his mother now says , " he would never be in the situation he is in today			0
" so what 's her message for other parents ? " maybe the mistake we made was maybe we protected our children			1
we were trying to protect our culture or values			0
maybe that was a mistake , " @entity13 said			0
" i would tell them to expose their children more to what 's going on in the world , help them develop critical thinking skills to differentiate between the good and the bad guys			2
" @entity1 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			2
