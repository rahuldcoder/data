-- everyone expected @entity3 flags to be flying high after the 100 meters final at the 2011 @entity4 -- but no - one predicted that @entity6 would not be performing his customary celebration rituals			1
the world 's fastest man had to watch as his training partner @entity10 took his title in @entity12 , with the @entity14 champion having been disqualified for a false start			1
the furore over @entity6 's predicament completely overshadowed the achievement of his 22 - year - old compatriot , who became the youngest world champion since @entity22 sprint legend @entity21 was crowned in 1983 aged just 21			1
they are firm friends as well as training partners , but when the starting gun sounds at this year 's @entity27 , there will only be one thing on @entity10 's mind -- scooping another one of @entity6 's titles			1
@entity6 won the 100m and 200m events in record times at @entity33 , and earned a third gold in the 4x100m relay , but @entity10 is closing the gap on his idol with personal bests last year			1
@entity0 's human to hero show caught up with the boy from @entity42 as he turns his attention to performing on the biggest stage of all			0
early days @entity10 's sprinting career took off in his early teens when he was spotted running at his school in @entity49 , and he made a big impression at the @entity51 -- a @entity53 track and field meeting for young athletes			1
" somebody just saw me running , went up to my school principal and said ' you 've got a new track star there , " and from there it started , from the age of 15 or so i started running , " he says			0
" when i was in @entity64 i ran the @entity3 national junior record of 10.11 seconds			1
i was running at the @entity51 when i ran 10.18 secs in the semis			0
and i ran 10.11 in the final , so from there i knew i could do something great			0
" i think it 's fate because i believe in fate and that it leads towards good things			0
" heroes " i really have to look up to @entity6 because of what he has done			2
just to be his training partner and know what he thinks and know what he can do -- i have to look up to him			0
" @entity79 ( 100m world record holder between june 2005 and may 2008 ) started it back in the day , and for a guy to do that to put @entity3 on the world stage and say ' look , @entity3 can dominate the world , ' i have to look up to someone like that that even though he did not get a world medal at the time			1
he has put @entity3 out there			2
" gold in @entity93 @entity10 posted a time of 9.92 seconds , enough to beat a strong field in the final but still well short of @entity6 's world record of 9.58			1
" what happened at @entity93 -- @entity6 is on the world stage and people are always going to look at that , " @entity10 says			1
" but i think i turned people 's minds			0
it was n't a fluke , so i think when they look back on @entity93 they 'll say , ' oh , there 's a young man who is going to challenge him			2
' " @entity27 " my first time going into the @entity27 , you know , i think it is going to be a breathtaking moment for me			2
i want to go to the @entity27 , have some fun and come back home with some medals			2
" when i feel it is a big stage for me as the @entity27 is where the big times , the big things really happen because an @entity14 medal would really mean a lot			1
" it makes more sponsors come out to you , so going out to the @entity27 is going to be a really wonderful gift for me , really			2
" the competition " when you have @entity129 , @entity79 , @entity6 and myself lining up for the 100m , i 'm always excited because the competition is really good and i want to be the best person on the day , the best person to execute well , " @entity10 says			1
" i think that is what the world wants to see			0
it 's going to be really interesting , all them guys they come out feeling fit and feeling ready to go			0
" also in the 200m , @entity140 , me , @entity6 and @entity129 if he is fit , you know i think anything can happen and i think it 's just going to be interesting			2
" work ethic " i 'm a hard worker and i believe in time -- things take time to happen and it 's my time and it 's coming out			0
" i work assiduously at what i do , i like the heights by a great man			0
i work at night , always working			0
and what i got at @entity93 is what i 've been working on over the years and it is finally coming true			0
