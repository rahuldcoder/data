-- @entity2 football fans had a tantalizing glimpse into the future as some of the best players in world strutted their stuff in a special friendly match in @entity10 thursday night			1
@entity11 for @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13 topped the bill for a prestige friendly , which @entity12 won 1 - 0			1
the pair had last locked horns in @entity19 and @entity22 's @entity21 playoff match last november where @entity11 's brilliance proved the difference over the two legs			1
@entity2 has won the right to host the 2022 finals and although @entity11 and @entity13 are unlikely to have extended their careers to play in that @entity21 , similar quality is sure to be on view			1
what time of the year the competition will take place is the big question that has proved so controversial , with @entity36 examining the possibility of switching from the traditional summer slot to the @entity40 winter			0
conditions for thursday 's friendly in front of a capacity crowd at the @entity43 were near perfect for football , with a cooling light drizzle			0
ideal for @entity11 and his like , but just down the road fellow superstar @entity48 was kept waiting for his quarterfinal match in the @entity51 tennis against @entity52 , before winning in straight sets			0
temperatures during the summer in @entity2 can sometimes reach 50 degrees c , which is perplexing football 's administrators as well as local organizers , who have promised air - conditioned stadiums should the original dates be kept in the footballing calendar			0
@entity12 , who resume competition in @entity65 's @entity64 at the weekend , fielded a mixture of established first teamers like @entity11 , @entity68 and @entity69 with some fringe players and youngsters			2
it was two of them that combined to score the only goal of the match in the 19th minute as @entity77 produced a clever defense - splitting pass for young striker @entity79 to convert past @entity14 goakeeper @entity80			1
@entity13 , who scored 47 goals in 58 games in 2013 , showed his quality as @entity85 champions @entity14 looked to equalize			2
he twice set up @entity86 , but the @entity88 striker wasted both opportunities			0
@entity13 might have got on the scoresheet after the break but he headed over , the first of a number of chances for @entity14 , who had the better of the play			0
@entity11 also gave some thrilling glimpses of the quality which could earn him @entity100 accolade later this month , but failed to increase @entity12 's slender lead			0
at the final whistle @entity12 's coach @entity102 shook hands with the man who replaced him at @entity14 , @entity105 and both looked satisfied with a run - out for their teams ahead of weekend competitive action			2
@entity14 are @entity2 - owned and will likely repeat the exercise next year with reports suggesting @entity12 are slated again as part of the compensation they paid the @entity116 club for acquiring @entity102 .			1

@entity12 beat @entity14 1 - 0 in friendly in @entity2
goal from @entity79 in the first half *settled* the match
