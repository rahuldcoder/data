@entity0 -- another government official was placed on administrative leave monday in the continuing fallout over wasteful spending involving a 2010 @entity8 conference for government workers , the @entity2 announced			1
@entity10 , a deputy commissioner of the @entity11 in the @entity2 , was identified by a @entity13 oversight panel as the official seen in video footage from the conference appearing to make light of congressional oversight			1
according to an administration source who spoke on condition of not being identified , @entity10 became the eighth member of the @entity2 staff to be fired , placed on leave or otherwise removed from their job because of the controversy , the announcement by @entity2 spokesman @entity28 came after monday 's release of additional video footage involving the 2010 @entity31 , this time showing government workers mocking a clean energy campaign pushed by president @entity34			1
the video clip , made available by a @entity37 - led @entity36 , shows @entity2 workers promoting the " go green " campaign , singing along to a gospel - style tune			2
one line of the song says " @entity44 wants a press event , a project he can show , " while a worker holds up a portrait of @entity34			0
@entity44 stands for " president of the @entity51			0
" the workers ' video was submitted for an awards competition at the 2010 conference , and accompanying footage of the awards ceremony shows a @entity2 official saying the video included any workers who were in the office on the day it was made			1
reports of the lavish conference have prompted taxpayer outrage , embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the agency , which acts as a real estate agency for the federal government			1
an inspector - general 's report issued last week that detailed the excesses of the $ 820,000 conference brought the resignation of @entity2 chief @entity77 , after she fired two top officials			1
in addition , congressional investigators are accusing the @entity2 of violating its employee gift limit with rewards of @entity83 , digital cameras and other electronics			1
with the agency coming under fire , an @entity34 administration source told @entity1 that the budget for the biennial conference ballooned during the @entity92 administration , growing from just under $ 94,000 for the 2004 event in @entity94 , @entity95 , to just over $ 655,000 by the 2008 confab in @entity97			0
by comparison , the source said , the tab for the 2010 conference was only 28 % higher than 2008			2
but a spokeswoman for the @entity37 - led @entity36 , which has scheduled a hearing on the @entity2 for monday , dismissed the argument			0
" it 's certainly important to understand whether increased costs in past years were used for real work and offset elsewhere or if increases were attributable to the kind of lavish spending that occurred in 2010 on parties , clowns , mind readers , commemorative coins and music videos done on official time , " committee spokeswoman @entity104 said			2
but she added , " these statistics have been pushed by anonymous voices that have so far refused to provide critical details and context in the midst of their efforts to blame the @entity92 administration for abuses that occurred in 2010			0
" @entity104 said the committee , led by @entity132 rep. @entity131 , " has requested that @entity2 deliver information about previous conferences , including their cost and the number of individuals who attended			0
" the @entity2 has denounced the actions of those who put on the 2010 conference and were depicted in a series of video clips made public in the past week			1
" these videos reinforce once again the complete lack of judgment exhibited during the 2010 @entity31 , " @entity28 said monday			0
" our agency continues to be appalled by this indefensible behavior , and we are taking every step possible to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again			0
" on friday , @entity37 investigators for the @entity147 said the @entity2 's @entity2 developed an employee incentive program dating back several years known as the " @entity149 " that spent nearly $ 500,000 on gifts -- from ipods to gps devices -- that vastly exceeded its $ 99 - per - gift limit			1
the investigators also said that accounting for the gifts , as well as the justification for giving them , was lacking or inconsistent , according to a statement released by rep. @entity158 , @entity132 , chairman of the @entity159 , and rep. @entity160 , @entity161 , chairman of the @entity162			0
while the investigation found the @entity2 's massive spending began in 2007 under the @entity92 administration and continued under the current leadership , @entity37 representatives leading the investigation have hammered @entity34 over the allegations			1
meanwhile , @entity131 has accused the @entity13 of sitting on the inspector general 's findings about the @entity2 for 11 months			2
the administration has dismissed @entity131 's claims , saying the investigation followed proper procedures			0
@entity131 and @entity160 plan congressional hearings on the issue next week			0
@entity178 sen. @entity177 , the chairwoman of the @entity179 , says she also will hold hearings on the @entity2 findings next week			1
@entity28 said the @entity2 welcomes " responsible oversight " and " remains committed to eliminating excessive federal spending and promoting government efficiency			2
" @entity1 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
