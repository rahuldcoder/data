-- @entity3 prosecutors have offered teenager @entity4 a new plea deal -- one that would keep her out of jail , even if she 'd have to admit wrongdoing -- tied to charges she 's facing for having sex with a then - 14 - year - old girl , a state attorney said wednesday			1
@entity4 , who turned 19 on wednesday according to her family , is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14 - year - old went to authorities			1
@entity4 's family says their relationship was consensual , though in @entity3 a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex			1
@entity25 , state attorney for @entity3 's 19th judicial circuit , told @entity0 that his office offered @entity4 the latest plea deal in july			1
under its terms , she would plead to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody -- a charge that could be expunged later from her record -- said @entity25			1
in exchange , @entity4 would be subject to a curfew , would have to do community service and would be on probation , he added			1
but she would not face jail time , nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender			2
the state attorney says he feels the plea deal addresses the concerns of @entity4 , the younger teenage girl and their respective families			1
@entity4 's lawyer replied that her client would n't agree to such a deal , according to @entity25			2
but the state attorney 's office is pressing the lawyer further , asking for documentation that shows @entity4 talked about the arrangement with her client and that @entity4 formally declined it			2
as of wednesday , that last part had n't happened , @entity25 said			0
if @entity4 is convicted on all charges she 's currently facing , she could go to prison for 15 years			2
no trial date has been set			0
the current offer is at least the second plea deal offered by prosecutors			1
last spring , @entity4 rejected one that would have required her to plead no contest to child abuse and , in return , spend two years on strict " community control " followed by one year of probation			1
" if this case involved a boy and girl , there would be no media attention to this case , " her attorney @entity72 said then in a statement			0
" ... if this incident occurred 108 days earlier when ( @entity4 ) was 17 , we would n't even be here			0
" the case generated buzz when @entity4 's family went public on @entity85 , detailing their daughter 's case and essentially accusing the victim 's family of going after their daughter because she is gay			2
the victim 's family said that is n't true ; they are only trying to protect their teenage daughter			0
sheriff : case is about age , not gay rights @entity102 and @entity103 have told @entity0 affiliate @entity104 that they twice warned @entity4 , who was then 18 , to stop			0
they took action after going to their daughter 's bedroom one weekend morning and discovered she was missing			0
" we had no other alternative but to turn to the law , use it basically as a last resort , " @entity110 said			0
@entity4 's supporters see the case differently , with some accusing the @entity118 of going after the teen because of her sexual orientation			1
and for @entity121 herself , she does n't want to pay for a relationship that , in her opinion , was not wrong			0
" i 'm scared of losing my life , the rest of my life , " she said earlier this year , " not being able to go to college or be around kids , be around my sisters and my family			0
" @entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0
