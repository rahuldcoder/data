@entity8 's face once needed eight stitches while on the job , but he quickly returned to the ice , ready for another 20 minutes of relentless action			2
" that 's hockey , " is a common response from any player when suffering sport - related injuries			2
but @entity8 , 23 , is a linesman with the @entity18 , the @entity19 's double - a league			1
" ninety - five percent of hockey players would n't take our job , " said hockey official @entity20 , referring to the lower pay , heavy travel schedule , verbal abuse and stiff competition for a coveted officiating position in the @entity19			1
@entity20 is an @entity18 referee or " the boss on the ice			2
" they make all final decisions on calls , penalties and disputed goals			0
linesmen follow the action , break up fights , call minor penalties and drop the puck			1
officials face a crowd of hockey fans who will never be satisfied with every call -- and fans are n't shy about voicing it			1
" you get booed a lot , but you learn to like it			0
you get so used to it , it kind of becomes comical , " @entity8 said , adding he tries not to take it personally			0
after growing up playing hockey , @entity8 attended one of @entity56 's weeklong summer camps taught by seasoned supervisors			1
he then worked his way up through the tiered levels of hockey			2
@entity61 , director of officiating for the @entity18 , hires skilled skaters with good judgment who are hungry for a spot in the @entity19 and are physically and mentally tough			1
while the hockey players get regular line changes , officials only get a real break every 30 minutes			1
" our general rule of thumb is to be in as good of shape as the players , if not better , " @entity20 said			1
" the players will be out for 45 seconds and go red line as hard as they can			1
for us , it 's more of a marathon			0
" during the playoffs under way now , the officials face more pressure than normal because their calls could land an important player in the penalty box or disallow a goal			2
so each call could have an affect on who wins the league title			0
both referees and linesmen need thick skin to deal with angry coaches and players over disputed calls			2
" you have to stay professional no matter how unprofessionally someone may treat you			0
it 's keeping your cool when most people would lose it , " @entity8 said			0
officials also have to anticipate plays before they happen			1

once a full - time fireman , @entity20 , a 26 - year - old @entity106 , @entity107 , native , now regularly travels from @entity110 to @entity111			0
" when we have days off , we call them ' @entity114 ' or gym / tan / laundry days , " @entity20 said			0
" at our level , if we do n't work , we do n't get paid , so we try and stay as healthy as possible			0
" since becoming a full - time official this season , @entity8 has worked 94 games between the @entity18 and the slightly more skilled @entity120			2
working developmental leagues required him to live in @entity122 , @entity123 , for the last two years			1
this season , @entity8 relocated to @entity125 , @entity126 , to work as one of 69 linesmen for the @entity18 's southeastern teams			0
the men are competing against others in the field for a narrow chance in the @entity19 while making little pay ; officiating in the lower leagues may seem like it has little to recommend itself as a career			1
@entity20 recommends having a solid back - up career in place , because leagues can only hire a few guys at a time			1
if you ca n't imagine not wearing the stripes , ask about officiating at your local hockey rink			2
" you can have a career where you work 9 to 5 , but it 's not near as exciting as this , " @entity20 said			0
" there are no guarantees			0
you have to put your life on hold and you never get to go home			0
you have to be a little nuts			0
" the pressure of making quick judgments on disputed goals or penalties is part of officiating life , but never so much as right now during the playoffs			0
" in the playoffs , when the crowd gets going and there have been some big hits and things are going crazy , you do n't know what to expect next , " @entity8 said			0
" that 's when you just kind of think to yourself , ' wow , this is a pretty good job			2

getting hit by pucks and breaking up fights is just one challenge for hockey officials
developmental leagues hire skilled skaters with good judgment , hungry for the @entity19
while the hockey players get regular line changes , officials get a break every 30 minutes
" @entity56 sense , " anticipating plays before they happen , is a must for officials
