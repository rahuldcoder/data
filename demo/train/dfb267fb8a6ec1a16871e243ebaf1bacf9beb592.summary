the weekend 's sermon at @entity6 was " surviving @entity4 , " a theme pastor @entity1 planned before his youngest son killed himself with a gun friday			1
@entity8 , 27 , committed suicide " in a momentary wave of despair " at the end of a lifetime struggle " with mental illness , dark holes of depression and even suicidal thoughts , " the pastor wrote to the staff of his @entity20 megachurch			1
" @entity8 was an incredibly kind , gentle and compassionate young man whose sweet spirit was encouragement and comfort to many , " a statement from the church said			1
" unfortunately , he also suffered from mental illness resulting in deep depression and suicidal thoughts			1
despite the best health care available , this was an illness that was never fully controlled , and the emotional pain resulted in his decision to take his life			1
" friend @entity34 told @entity35 he had a " playful spirit			0
" " there are the days where he was just this bubbly , outgoing , effervescent , reaching out to people , " @entity34 said			0
" and there were the days where he just did n't want to be around people			0
just the pain , the excruciating pain , was just too much			0
" my take : how churches can respond to mental illness a prophetic message ? worship services continued as scheduled saturday and sunday with @entity1 's brother - in - law @entity50 -- an assistant pastor for the @entity52 , @entity20 , congregation -- filling in for @entity1			1
@entity1 asked @entity50 to take over when he became ill with pneumonia after a busy @entity57 weekend schedule , before his son 's sudden death , spokeswoman @entity54 said			2
" bad days make good ones better , " @entity1 's invitation to saturday 's service said on the church 's @entity63 page " it 's a message on what to do on the worst day of your life , " @entity50 said in saturday 's sermon			2
" so even before @entity1 knew what they would be facing at the end of the week , he was thinking this is what we need to hear			2
and it is what we need to hear			0
" @entity8 , the youngest of @entity1 's children , worked at the @entity81 , which distributes books and dvds and was " an important part of the church but played a quiet role , " @entity54 said			1
" after a fun evening together with @entity91 and me , in a momentary wave of despair at his home , he took his life , " pastor @entity1 wrote in an e-mail to his staff saturday			1
he was found dead from a self - inflicted gunshot wound at his home in @entity100 , @entity20 , late friday afternoon , the @entity97 said			1
the autopsy completed monday put the time of death at around 10 a.m. friday			0
as a pioneer of the megachurch movement , @entity1 looked to translate traditional evangelical messages to a wider audience			1
@entity1 , who founded @entity81 with his wife 33 years ago , gave the invocation at president @entity110 's 2009 inauguration and penned " @entity111 , " a @entity113 self - help guide that became a mainstream best - seller			2
my take : let 's stop keeping mental illness a secret @entity1 's e-mail subject : needing your prayers to my dear staff , over the past 33 years we 've been together through every kind of crisis			1
@entity91 and i 've been privileged to hold your hands as you faced a crisis or loss , stand with you at gravesides , and prayed for you when ill. today , we need your prayer for us			0
no words can express the anguished grief we feel right now			0
our youngest son , @entity8 , age 27 , and a lifelong member of @entity6 , died today			2
you who watched @entity8 grow up knew he was an incredibly kind , gentle , and compassionate man			2
he had a brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable in a room			0
he 'd then make a bee - line to that person to engage and encourage them			0
but only those closest knew that he struggled from birth with mental illness , dark holes of depression , and even suicidal thoughts			1
in spite of @entity155 's best doctors , meds , counselors , and prayers for healing , the torture of mental illness never subsided			1
today , after a fun evening together with @entity91 and me , in a momentary wave of despair at his home , he took his life			0
@entity91 and i often marveled at his courage to keep moving in spite of relentless pain			0
i 'll never forget how , many years ago , after another approach had failed to give relief , @entity8 said " @entity172 , i know i 'm going to heaven			2
why ca n't i just die and end this pain ? " but he kept going for another decade			0
thank you for your love and prayers			0
