-- @entity2 immigration officials , testing controversial new protocols that give them discretion to " administratively close " immigration cases instead of taking them to court , have recommended that about 14 % of the nearly 12,000 cases reviewed thus far be closed , allowing those people to remain in the @entity2			1
of the 11,682 immigration cases reviewed in two test cities -- @entity13 and @entity14 -- officials have recommended closing 1,667 cases , provided they pass a final background check			1
the @entity17 cautioned the numbers are preliminary , and do not reflect the ultimate number that will be closed			2
" for a variety of reasons , including the results of background checks , the final results of the pilot programs will likely differ from these preliminary numbers , " @entity17 official @entity20 wrote in a memo obtained by @entity0			1
if the 14 % were to hold consistent for the 300,000 cases pending before the immigration courts , approximately 42,000 immigrants would bypass the courts and be permitted to stay in the @entity2			2
the @entity33 administration has touted the use of " prosecutorial discretion " as " smart and effective immigration enforcement , " saying it will allow undocumented aliens to stay in the @entity2 in special cases			2
immigration officials who make the decisions must consider a long list of factors , such as whether the undocumented immigrant served in the @entity2 military , has roots in the community or serves as care provider for a person in need			0
prior administrations used similar discretion in vetting cases , @entity33 administration officials have said			0
but critics call the program a " backdoor amnesty program , " saying the administration is trying to accomplish through executive fiat what it could not accomplish legislatively			0
" if these results play out nationwide , tens of thousands of illegal immigrants will benefit and tens of thousands of @entity2 will find it harder to get jobs			0
how can the @entity33 administration justify granting work authorization to illegal immigrants when so many @entity2 citizens do n't have jobs ? " said rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , chairman of the @entity66			0
the administration said the new policy gives immigration officials guidelines on which immigration cases to pursue , with the highest priority being on people who pose a danger to public safety or national security , or who are egregious immigration law violators			1
but the program is still in its infancy , and will face questions from both supporters and opponents , including why there is a discrepancy in approvals in @entity13 , where about 9.7 % of the cases were administratively closed , and @entity14 , where 16 % were closed			0
@entity17 told @entity88 it will brief congress members once the pilot program is completed .			1
