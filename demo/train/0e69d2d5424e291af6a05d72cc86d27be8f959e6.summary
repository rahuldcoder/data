@entity0 -- @entity3 question : who is the world 's third biggest smartphone maker ? blackberry ? guess again			1
yes , it 's a paltry 5 % of the global market , but the @entity14 company that made its name selling telecom equipment is making a big push into the already crowded global smartphone market			1
i saw that ambition first hand at the @entity21 in @entity22 earlier this year			0
@entity10 ads were posted all over the airport to greet the throngs of international conference - goers			2
the company also occupied a huge booth at the venue positioned just across from @entity30			0
but just how big does @entity10 -- the smartphone maker -- want to get ? at company headquarters in @entity32 in southern @entity14 , i talked to @entity33 , ceo of @entity10 's @entity34			1
he told me his division hopes to boost its mobile business revenue from $ 7.5 billion to $ 9 billion this year			0
" last year , we shipped out 32 million smartphones in quantity and this year we hope we will ship out 50 to 60 million smartphones worldwide , " he said			0
" the market priority for @entity10 's @entity34 is @entity14 , followed by @entity42 and @entity43			1
but -- when it comes to smartphones -- it 's not ruling out the @entity48 market despite the recent back and forth about @entity10 's commitment there			1
in the @entity48 , the name @entity10 is widely regarded with suspicion			1
lawmakers are worried that @entity10 products can be used as a hidden channel for @entity14 spies and cyber hackers -- a charge that @entity10 has denied			1
despite the trust issues and the fact that many @entity48 ca n't even pronounce the name of the company , @entity10 has sold and will continue to sell its phones in @entity48 under the @entity10 brand			1
" gradually , step by step , more and more people will trust @entity10 , " said @entity33			0
" i think with a brand , the most important thing is trust			0
" @entity10 prides itself on its investment in research and development -- 70,000 of its 150,000 employees are in r&d -- as well as its high - end products like the $ 500 @entity75 , which is billed as the " world 's fastest @entity77 smartphone			1
" @entity33 told me his personal favorite is the @entity81 , @entity10 's $ 600 flagship smartphone that is water - resistant -- a point famously made by @entity33 when he posted a photo of himself swimming with the smartphone on his @entity88 account			1
but @entity10 is more widely known for its $ 100 ( y - 300 ) smartphone -- a cut - price device that @entity91 of @entity92 says is the company 's competitive advantage and branding bane			1
" @entity10 is going to be able to execute on smartphones at lower costs than some of its international competitors , " he said			1
" it does n't have the cachet or consumer loyalty that @entity102 and @entity30 do			0
" my colleague @entity103 in @entity104 offered this on - the - ground @entity14 consumer perspective : " to me and my friends , @entity10 is more like a brand of low - end , cheap smartphones			1
" ( such ) @entity14 brands are popular among the ' ant tribe community , ' which refers to young people who come to the city for a better job but got stuck with low - paid jobs and high costs to live in the city			2
in their eyes , these @entity14 smartphones are a lot cheaper than big brands like the @entity122 and almost as good			2
" @entity10 has a reputation for making smartphones that are just good enough			2
but that 's not good enough for @entity10			0
to upgrade its image , the company says it will bypass expensive branding campaigns and splashy ads to focus on innovation to generate viral , word - of - mouth recommendations			0
and that will take time			0
" @entity134 was not built in a day , " said @entity33			0
" we have the ambition to be the best -- to have the best products and be the best solution provider			0
" would you buy a @entity10 smartphone ? perhaps , if that 's what you 're after			2
they 're " good enough			0
" would you want to buy one ? not yet			0
and that 's the question @entity10 has its designs on .			2

@entity14 's @entity10 is now the world 's third biggest smartphone maker
the @entity32 - based manufacturer has designs on markets outside @entity14
@entity48 , lawmakers worry @entity10 products could be hidden channel spies , hackers
the company produces smartphones priced much lower than rivals such as @entity102
