@entity0 -- undercover government investigators were able to get into major @entity5 seaports -- at one point driving a vehicle containing a simulated explosive -- by flashing counterfeit or fraudulently obtained port " credentials " to security officials -- raising serious questions about a program that has issued the cards to more than 1.6 million people , @entity2 disclosed tuesday			1
at issue are @entity17 , or @entity19 cards , now needed by truckers , stevedores , longshoreman and others for unescorted access to the nation 's ports			2
the @entity27 has long touted the cards as one of the most important layers in its multilayered system to protect ports from terrorists			2
but , in a highly critical report , the @entity34 said tuesday the program does not provide reasonable assurance that only qualified people get the credentials			1
in tests , @entity34 investigators got into ports using counterfeit @entity43 or authentic @entity45 acquired through fraudulent means , and by stating false reasons for needing access			1
" this investigation raises a disturbing question : @entity54 's ports actually safer now than they were a decade ago ? " said sen. @entity51 , @entity52			0
" not only were they able to access the port facilities , but they were able to drive a vehicle with a simulated explosive into a secure area , " he said			0
an unclassified version of the report did not state how many tests were conducted , nor how many efforts were successful			2
but it said the tests were conducted at some of the nation 's busiest seaports			0
the findings are significant because a @entity19 card suggests that its holder is not a security threat and potentially eases access to thousands of facilities , including airports and military installations , the @entity34 said			1
transportation security administrator @entity77 defended the @entity19 system , saying 35,000 of the 1.8 million applicants failed criminal background checks			1
under the program , those who fail background checks can request a waiver and be granted a twic			0
ultimately , 1,158 applicants were denied cards because of their criminal histories or immigration status , the @entity85 said			0
in addition , several were disqualified because they were on terror watch lists			0
but the @entity34 said there are ways for unqualified individuals to acquire authentic @entity96 , and said the @entity85 had not established internal controls to protect against abuse			1
further , the @entity19 program does not require that applicants claiming to be @entity5 - born citizens or nationals to provide identity documents that prove citizenship , the @entity34 said			1
and controls are not in place to determine whether an applicant needs a @entity19 , the @entity34 said			1
" it seems to me that a decade of work has resulted in a system that would put @entity112 to shame , " said sen. @entity107 , @entity108			0
said @entity51 : " given the critical importance of our ports , it is unacceptable that we are spending hundreds of millions of tax dollars on a program that might actually be making ports less safe			0
" rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , said he is upset @entity27 has not approved a technology to read the credentials , meaning guards must visually examine the credentials			2
" @entity19 is turning into a dangerous and expensive experiment in security , " he said in a statement			2
" nearly half a billion dollars has been spent since @entity85 was directed to issue biometric security cards to transportation workers , " @entity120 said			1
" yet today , 10 years later and with no approved biometric reader , @entity43 are at best no more useful than library cards			0
" sen. @entity133 , d - @entity134 , said he plans to address legislation in the coming months for some of the shortcomings exposed by the @entity34			1
" the program needs stronger fraud controls , " he said			0
" we also need to take a clear , hard look at whether we are getting enough return on our investment			0
is the money we 're spending on @entity19 being used wisely ? are there other security programs that would cost less but work as well as @entity19 ? these are questions we need answers to			2

transportation security at risk , report says
worker ids easily faked , @entity34 finds
plus unqualified people can get real credentials , report says
