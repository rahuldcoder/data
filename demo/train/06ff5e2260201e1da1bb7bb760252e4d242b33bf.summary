-- president @entity1 is about to send up to 300 military advisers to @entity3 in an attempt to stabilize a situation that is rapidly disintegrating			1
@entity1 had hoped that the end of the @entity3 war would be a key accomplishment of his administration			1
but just as he thought it was safe to get out , the president is finding himself drawn back , as violence has been spreading throughout @entity3			2
understanding that @entity14 patience for another war is limited , president @entity1 promises this mission will be contained			1
but mission creep is difficult to avoid			1
the history of military involvement shows that many operations that start small end big			1
while the @entity14 initially entered @entity23 to try to get the @entity24 out of @entity23 after an invasion , president @entity22 found himself presiding over a full - scale military mobilization that lasted three years , cost over 30,000 lives and helped bring down his administration			1
@entity29 started small , with military advisers under presidents @entity31 and @entity32			1
even when president @entity33 requested from @entity34 the @entity35 that granted him broad authority to use military force , he did n't imagine how big the conflict would become , resulting in the death of nearly 60,000 @entity14 soldiers and dramatically undermining @entity14 's role in the world			2
examples of mission creep continued			2
@entity45 had 30,000 troops enter into a peacekeeping mission in @entity48			2
the mission did n't go so well			0
as a result of an attack on @entity54 forces by a warlord in the country , the operation expanded and president @entity57 found himself ordering more expansive operations			0
although @entity45 was determined to stick to his goal of kicking @entity60 out of @entity61 in 1990 and 1991 , once troops were in the region , the @entity14 became committed to ongoing engagement with @entity60 as he flouted @entity54 resolutions			0
in @entity66 and @entity3 after 9/11 , the @entity14 vastly broadened the scale and scope of its operations as challenges of post-regime reconstruction proved immense			0
why does it prove so difficult to contain operations ? why is mission creep so common ? most importantly , war inherently involves many moving parts , most of which are not under the control of the commander in chief			1
often , as was the case with @entity29 in the 1960s , allies prove difficult to rely on and cause problems of their own , while opponents frequently are capable of causing far more trouble than expected , even when they have fewer resources than the @entity14			2
although a mission might seem small at first , the logic of war creates new dangers for advisers or soldiers in the field and makes it very difficult to avoid pouring more resources into a problem			2
very often the political pressures to escalate intensify once a president has committed forces to a region , particularly in the early years of a conflict			0
both parties , as was the case with the @entity105 and in the aftermath of 9/11 , vie to be the party that will be tougher against the nation 's adversary			0
neither party wants to look weak , to be the party , as @entity112 said of @entity113 after 1949 , that lost @entity115 to communism			0
finally , in this day and age , many of the missions that involve @entity14 troops are not clear - cut or well defined			0
it is unclear what victory even looks like anymore			0
during the war against terrorism , the @entity14 has found itself drawn into operations where it is trying to create stable government structures that will not house terrorist networks or work on a continuous basis in countries to fight against fundamentalist forces			0
none of this lends itself to a quick end or to limited involvement			0
president @entity1 might get lucky and find that the advisers he sent to do the job get the job done			1
but history shows that mission creep can also happen quite quickly , and the president could easily find himself forced to send more troops than he expected into the quagmire of @entity3 .			1

president @entity1 plans to send 300 military advisers to @entity3 to stabilize conflict
@entity147 : history shows us that mission creep is difficult to avoid
he says many operations - in @entity23 , @entity29 , @entity48 - start small but end big
@entity147 : @entity1 could find himself forced to send more troops than he expected
