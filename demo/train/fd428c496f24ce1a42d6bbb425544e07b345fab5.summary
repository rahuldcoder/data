for many women , a @entity1 closet would be a dream come true			0
but without one , dressing for a special occasion can be a girl 's nightmare			0
@entity7 meets @entity8 and @entity9 , co-founders of @entity12 company @entity11 , who are hoping to solve the age old dilemma of having nothing to wear			1
@entity17 : what was the idea behind starting @entity20 ? @entity8 : you know us girls , we are always facing the issue that we have a whole closet of clothes , of dresses , but that we still do n't know what to wear			1
with @entity11 , this is like your best friend 's closet - you dont have to spend thousands of dollars to buy a dress you 're only going to wear once or twice			2
@entity17 : yeechoo functions as a shared closet focusing on variety over ownership			0
how does that work ? @entity9 : what we found is a girl would only wear a dress maximum of five to six times , and on average only twice or three times before they get forgotten			0
that 's why we think the cost per wear is just too high to justify the high price tag for the designer dresses			1
we always say you can spend $ 10,000 on one dress , or $ 10,000 for ten different dresses			1
@entity17 : how do you keep up with the variety of women 's sartorial tastes worldwide ? s : we always need to expand our styles that fit different bodies because all the girls have different tastes and different needs			0
@entity17 : which markets have been the most receptive to @entity11 ? a : @entity63 's not very into second hand clothing , it 's unlike @entity65 or @entity66			0
people are very conservative , and they 'd rather chose fast fashion over secondhand clothing , so the challenge is to educate our customers , too			2
@entity17 : what kind of effect do you hope the company will have on the fashion industry ? a : at the moment , only a very small fraction of people can have access to a luxury good , to designer brands , because of their high price			1
but @entity84 made a change , and has made a disruptive entry here			2
we are democratizing the fashion industry , and making it accessible to the mass market .			1

in @entity12 , fashion rental site @entity84 hopes to *transform* how we approach *evening* wear
they *encourage* customers to spend $ 10,000 on *borrowing* 10 different dresses , instead of buying one for the same price
the company 's founders believe this will make designer clothes accessible to the mass market
