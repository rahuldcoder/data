-- a giant cross that has stood on a @entity4 mountain for decades must be removed because it violates the constitutional separation of church and state , a judge ordered this week			1
the order thursday by @entity8 district judge @entity7 continues a long legal battle about the 43 - foot cross atop @entity11			2
@entity7 ordered that the cross would have to be removed within 90 days			1
but the cross may be able to stay if the case is appealed , the judge ordered			1
" of course we are disappointed in what the ruling is -- that is to take the cross down , " @entity18 , president of the @entity19 told @entity0 affiliate @entity20			2
@entity18 said his organization plans to appeal , which would mean the cross would stay as the decades - long legal battle continued			1
long legal battle the cross was erected in 1954 in honor of @entity33 veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back and forth since 1989 , when two @entity37 veterans filed suit saying it violated the @entity41 's " no preference " clause			0
since the first lawsuit in 1989 , the city of @entity13 twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the @entity19 , only to be stopped by the courts			1
in 2004 , the parties involved reached an agreement that would have moved the cross to a nearby church , but two congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property a national veterans memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property			0
this led to more fights and more court filings			0
in 2006 , three congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it " a historically significant war memorial			0
" the federal government took possession in august of that year			0
a lawsuit was filed challenging that transfer almost immediately and that has led to thursday 's ruling .			0

the judge orders the giant cross must be removed in 90 days
but judge also orders cross can stay if case is appealed
the fight over giant cross in @entity13 has been going on for decades
