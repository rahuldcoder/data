-- the execution of @entity7 , an @entity8 woman in her 20 's , shot 13 times in front of a cheering crowed in @entity3 -- and seen widely online in a grainy cell phone video -- is a show of confidence by the @entity11			1
it 's unclear why she was shot , but local officials offer various reasons for her execution			0
she was reportedly executed last month for adultery , a crime that is indeed punishable in @entity20			2
but for an adultery charge to be proved , @entity20 requires four eyewitness accounts that match precisely			2
this is nearly impossible in cultures like @entity7 's , where sexual acts are extremely discrete			0
but that religious requirement is irrelevant in any case to the @entity11 , whose fanatic view of @entity20 has been nothing but a violation of the spirit of the religion itself			1
manhunt under way for @entity11 who shot woman in public execution amid cheers after an hour - long trial , @entity7 was shot either by her @entity11 husband or someone else			1
( one version of the story is she had affairs with two @entity11 members			0
) but this case is less about @entity7 and more about the @entity11 demonstrating its power , even as the @entity50 and @entity8 attempt negotiations with the @entity11			1
you see , women are like the canary in the coal mine : what happens to them is an indicator of a larger political direction for the society			0
the @entity11 has consistently used women to demonstrate its power			2
when it first took over much of @entity8 in 1996 , it imposed the harshest seclusion and prosecution of women in modern history			2
@entity8 women suffered under house imprisonments			2
they were forbidden education and any form of mobility , to name only a few of its brutal prohibitions			0
but when the international community entered @entity8 in 2001 and started introducing laws to protect women 's rights , albeit in very basic ways , the @entity11 retreated as its political and military power was weakened			1
in the past two years , however , and particularly since the international community started talking about withdrawal from @entity8 , the @entity11 began boldly resuming its own rules in provinces where they have recently regained control , such as @entity3			1
and this has been reflected in one act of violence toward women after another			0
through such public acts -- sometimes recorded , as this one was -- the @entity11 is demonstrating its complete disregard of the @entity8 government and the national rule of law			1
women 's rights can not be taken lightly , nor can they be seen as a marginal issue separate from the political process of a country			0
the international community entered @entity8 with a clear promise to protect women 's rights and invest in creating opportunities for women to stand up on their feet			1
@entity8 women took advantage of the opportunities that were presented			2
they ran for and took political offices , they sent their daughters to school , they took loans from microcredit entities and started new business , and they worked in factories all at personal risks			0
they are now asking whether the international community is planning to abandon them as forces prepare to depart @entity8 in 2014 , and they are worried , very worried indeed			0
educated and uneducated women working in all sectors in the country are asking the same question : " is the international community going to sacrifice its promise to protect us from the rule of the @entity11 in order to reach political settlement with it ? " if it is , then all the efforts of every soldier , every taxpayer , every humanitarian worker who has worked -- and in some cases , died -- in @entity8 will have been in vain			1
to abandon the protection of women 's rights to seek political agreement with a force of repression is to risk a return not only to insecurity in @entity8 , but i 'd dare say to the world			1
the @entity11 only started its acts of violence with women			0
we have to remember that it did not stop there			0
that violence eventually affected every @entity8 man and child , and it eventually came to @entity50 and impacted the world			0
saving face : the struggle and survival of @entity8 women the taping of @entity7 's execution is the @entity11 's message that it is confident			1
what 's going to be the message back to them from the @entity8 government and the international community ? will it be to demonstrate that women 's rights and protections are valued in actions , in addition to the political statements already made condemning the execution ? we all are responsible for the answer to that question			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : execution of woman in @entity8 is show of @entity11 's confidence
she says *killing* woman for alleged adultery *flouted* @entity8 legal *system* , spirit of @entity20
she says @entity11 uses force to repress women first ; world must react , not just denounce
@entity175 : it 's short step between @entity11 brutality toward women , *aggression* to rest of world
