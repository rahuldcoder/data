move over , @entity0 : researchers say @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 may also be in the sky , with diamonds			1
the atmospheres of these gas - ball planets have the perfect temperature and pressure conditions to host carbon in the form of diamond , say @entity15 of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 of the @entity20			1
their research was presented wednesday at the @entity24 conference in @entity25			0
previous research had implicated @entity4 and @entity5 in the hypothetical space diamond business , but @entity15 and @entity19 performed calculations suggesting that @entity2 and @entity3 may host sparkly treasure , too			1
" they would be diamonds like we have here , except they would probably be a little more dense , " @entity15 said			0
" they would probably be the same translucent gem that we 're all familiar with			0
" this is all based on theory and modeling , of course			0
no spacecraft has actually detected diamonds , photographed them or collected them			0
but the theory did n't come entirely out of thin air			0
the phases of carbon you may remember from chemistry class that substances enter different physical states depending on temperature and pressure			1
for instance , water becomes ice at 32 degrees @entity53 and vapor at 212 f , at typical pressures on the surface of @entity57			0
carbon has more than one form that it takes as a solid			1
at low temperatures and pressures , carbon is stable as graphite , that soft substance in your pencils			2
much more extreme conditions are needed to turn carbon into diamonds , chemically identical to graphite but exquisitely strong , with atoms tightly bound to one another			1
scientists know that carbon in the form of methane is found in the atmospheres of @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- especially in the latter two			1
a methane molecule consists of one carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms			0
@entity81 pointed out in a 1981 nature study that @entity5 and @entity4 have deep interiors rich in methane , which would be converted into elemental carbon at high temperatures			1
the extreme temperature and pressure conditions would allow carbon to form diamond			1
more recently , shock - wave experiments , simulating extreme conditions on other planets , have more clearly shown the temperature and pressure boundaries between the various forms of carbon			1
@entity15 and @entity19 combined these latest insights with what is known about the temperatures and pressures in the interiors of the outer planets			1
from lightning to diamonds studying the storm systems on @entity2 , @entity19 noticed that there were patches in the atmosphere , where storm clouds had been , that were darker than regular clouds			2
he wanted to find out what material would have that effect			0
the substance that fit the scenario the best was carbon in the form of soot , like the kind you see when you burn wood -- likely as a result of lightning			2
the researchers published a study on this in 2009			0
but what happens when these carbon particles sink into the deep interior of @entity2 ? planetary researcher @entity132 at the @entity133 , @entity133 , developed graphs of how temperature and pressure changes with altitude for @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity5 and @entity4			1
@entity15 and @entity19 used this data -- much of which is unpublished -- and compared it with the recent insights about conditions for forming diamond			0
@entity15 and @entity19 confirmed that diamonds could exist on @entity5 and @entity4 , and showed that they could also form on @entity2 and @entity3			2
these planets are all made of gas , so their " interiors " are essentially very hot , pressurized gas			2
carbon would be soot in the top part of @entity2 's atmosphere , but as it falls , it would turn into graphite at around 2,000 degrees @entity154 ( 3,140 degrees f )			1
closer to the planet 's core , at around 3,000 @entity154 ) , it would become diamond			0
" it 's so far down that we can not observe that region of the atmosphere with spacecraft , " @entity15 said			0
the cores of @entity3 and @entity2 would melt diamond , but the centers of @entity5 and @entity4 are cold enough to keep it solid -- a relatively chilly 6,000 @entity167 )			1
@entity15 envisions that there could be " hand - sized diamonds " on these planets , although she has not performed those calculations			0
there could be as many as 10 million tons of diamonds produced from lightning - generated soot on @entity2 , the researchers said			1
are they really there , and can we get them ? scientists not involved in the project expressed a mixture of interest and skepticism			0
" this kind of study shows that we are still far from understanding the composition and structure of @entity3 and @entity2 , two planets which are respectively about 300 and 100 times the mass of our @entity57 and were crucial players when the whole @entity195 formed , " said @entity184 , planetary researcher at the @entity185 in @entity186 , in an e-mail			1
if there are diamonds , they likely would n't be large iceberg - sized " diamondbergs , " @entity184 said			0
any such structures would fall rapidly toward the planet 's interior , depleting the outer layers of carbon			2
that would result in a carbon - poor atmosphere -- which , scientists know , is not the case			0
it 's plausible that carbon in the form of diamond could be stable in the interiors of @entity2 and @entity3 , says @entity215 , professor of physics at the @entity217 , but he 's skeptical that diamonds like those on @entity57 would be found			1
rather than chunks of precious stone , there may be instead clouds of condensed diamond material , he said -- but we just do n't know			0
and if there are diamonds for the taking , they 'd be in regions in the deep interiors of these planets that are challenging to reach , @entity215 said			2
the temperatures are enormous , with pressures up to a million times what 's observed at the surface of the @entity57			0
this brings up important questions for would - be diamond miners : what would the mining robot be made of in order to withstand such temperatures and pressures ? ( @entity15 suggests diamonds ! ) how would the spacecraft be powered ? " there are probably many easier ( and cheaper ! ) ways to obtain diamonds than going to @entity5 or @entity4 in a heavily reinforced and insulated submarine ! " @entity215 said in an e-mail			2
although no diamond - mining space missions are on @entity256 's docket , we may know more about the likelihood of diamonds soon			0
the @entity260 spacecraft will arrive at @entity3 in 2016 , and the @entity262 spacecraft will dive into @entity2 in 2017 , collecting information about the gravity fields and magnetic fields of these planets			1
these spacecraft wo n't get deep enough to explore the theoretical diamond regions , but they will at least " be able to check whether we detect signatures of density changes that would occur near where diamond is predicted to form , " @entity184 said			2
more ambitious explorations of the outer planets may help us determine if these theories about diamonds will last forever			1

carbon has *multiple* solid states , *including* diamond and graphite
on @entity2 , soot could turn into diamond at high temperature and pressure
no spacecraft has gone this far into the interiors of the outer planets
