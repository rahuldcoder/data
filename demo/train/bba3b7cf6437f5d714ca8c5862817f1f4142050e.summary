trust the @entity0 to get it right -- in the end			1
when it comes to taking stock on @entity6 , i believe the @entity7 will be regarded as having brought the @entity9 concept home			1
@entity11 has brought the @entity9 back to what they have been and should always be			1
and we did it with that unique common sense for which my country is known			0
to be sure , the @entity7 were not as spectacular as , say @entity18			0
nor did they have the exotic " new world " quality of @entity20 so wonderfully laced with @entity22 freshness			0
they have n't been the biggest , the brightest , the tallest , the largest , the ( you add your own superlative here )			0
instead , they have been what they were always meant to be -- a celebration of athletic prowess infused with a tremendous sense of fun and good spirit emanating from the host nation 's culture			1
everything that has been bad about games in recent years was slowly , carefully addressed and ultimately dealt with in @entity39			1
the opening ceremony set the tone			0
with its green fields and satanic mills , to the self - deprecating humor from the @entity43 herself , @entity39 sent the not - so - subtle message : this was n't going to be " olympics as usual			1
" the @entity7 ' big budgets @entity51 finally finished off paying for the 1976 games 30 years later in november 2006			0
@entity53 was twice over budget			0
and of course , we will never know how much the @entity18 games truly cost			2
in @entity39 an original , fictional bid - budget of £ 2.7 billion ( $ 4.2 billion ) was quickly abandoned in 2007 in favor of a realistic , £ 9.3 billion ( $ 14.6 billion ) with a huge contingency for unforeseen costs such as security			1
to those who criticize the three - times bid - budget , there is one crucial fact to bear in mind			0
in 2008 , like other countries in recession , @entity11 embarked on stimulus spending			1
we were fortunate that we actually had real projects and purpose upon which to spend the cash , rather than the bridges and roads to nowhere of other countries			0
we did n't have to invent places to spend the money because the @entity9 was waiting			2
if there was ever a time to have the @entity9 , this was it -- when the expenditure was economically needed			1
in fact , the contingency money allocated has proved to be more than enough			0
a political row is about to break out over what to do with the £ 300 million under - spend and whether it should just be handed back to the cash - strapped @entity88			1
my own view is some of it should be used for a tourism campaign next year to help bring those guests who stayed away fearing the crowds			0
the @entity9 legacy olympics today are all about legacy			1
it was the prospect of regenerating @entity39 's derelict @entity100 which helped win the games			1
since then billions of pounds have been spent , not just on the facilities per se , but on the infrastructure around them			0
and in the city , those of us who live here and have suffered years of weekend closure of tube lines for " scheduled maintenance " and " replacing signals " can be in no doubt we will reap the benefits once everyone has gone home			0
we have a regenerated subway that is once again world - class			0
so when the @entity121 president @entity120 said , " @entity39 has created a legacy blueprint " and " has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy , " we can neatly tick that one off as a rousing success from which other cities can learn			1
organizational triumph from day one , @entity11 was determined not to have another @entity130 fiasco , or @entity132 disaster , where it seemed every major construction project ended up delayed , over budget and in acrimony ( incidentally the @entity132 is now the most successful concert venue in @entity138 as the @entity139 -- so there ! ) with the @entity9 , we simply got on with it			1
the @entity140 , designed by @entity141 , was completed and tested a year before the games began			0
the @entity143 had the lights switched on by the prime minister back in december and its final test was four months before the opening ceremony			2
in fact the @entity121 never did doubt everything would be ready			2
@entity39 has conclusively shown that by being more realistic in ambition , everything can be done without the heartache and angst of previous games			2
for the @entity0 people themselves , there has been a renewed pride in the country -- helped of course by record gold medals			1
i accept this might be a mile wide but an inch deep , but i can not recall the last time i have seen so many people proudly walking the streets with the @entity168 flag wrapped around their shoulders			2
the legacy of confidence means it is the challenge of politicians and civic leaders to foster that spirit so it does n't disappear along with the fleeting summer sun. every time @entity39 has hosted the games it has done so in testing times			1
in 1908 @entity39 rescued the @entity9 after @entity179 volcano erupted , causing the selected city of @entity181 to pull out			1
in 1948 @entity39 hosted the so - called " @entity184 " three years after the end of @entity183			2
they were the first olympics in 12 years			0
so re-establishing the @entity9 is something of a tradition here			2
to this we now add 2012 , where i gently suggest @entity39 has subtly re-established the @entity9 tradition by bringing back a dose of sanity			1
we have proved , firstly , that the @entity9 are manageable , and affordable , if done right			2
we have proved they can be fun for everyone ( even the people who live in the city )			0
@entity39 will probably never host the games again			2
i was proud to be in the stadium on saturday night singing our national anthem after @entity202 won his second gold medal			0
just as i have been proud to be here , in my capital city , to see us get it right and leave a legacy for the city , the country and the games themselves .			0

quest : @entity11 has brought the @entity9 back a dose of sanity
though criticized , the £ 9.3 billion cost was put to good use at a time of stimulus spending
@entity121 president @entity120 : " @entity39 has created a legacy blueprint "
challenge for @entity0 civic and political leaders : @entity11 's @entity9 pride
