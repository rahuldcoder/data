-- @entity2 's far - right @entity1 has won a nationwide election for the first time , as far - right parties across @entity6 caused a political " earthquake , " with a string of victories in voting for the @entity9			1
the @entity1 , led by @entity11 , notched up 24.95 % of the vote in @entity2 , according to official estimates , well ahead of mainstream parties @entity14 and the @entity15			1
@entity16 said the win showed that people want to see change in @entity6			1
@entity2 's @entity21 prime minister @entity20 said the result was " more than a warning			1
it is a shock , an earthquake			2
" right - wing parties also gained ground in the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , according to projections posted on the @entity9 's official elections website			2
voters across @entity6 have been casting ballots for days in the parliamentary vote			1
there are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs			1
with most of the ballots counted , provisional results indicate that left - center and right - center parties will still hold a majority of seats in the @entity9 , which plays a key role in shaping @entity6 laws and will weigh in on who the @entity49 's next president should be			1
but right - wing parties and other so - called @entity53 groups who oppose the @entity55 are gaining ground , said @entity57 , an expert on @entity6 politics at the @entity59			1
" i think what 's really changed is you 're seeing a lot more groups on the edges , particularly with the far right , who are going to be much more of a feature of the next five years of the parliament , " he said			0
so what does that mean ? " they do n't have enough votes to stop legislation going through , " @entity57 told @entity0 , " but what they will get , particularly on the far right , is the time for speaking in debates , the chairmanship of certain committees , which means that they 're going to have much more of a platform on which they can sell their message to voters			2
" in @entity2 , which has 74 seats in the @entity9 , the @entity1 won 24.95 % of votes , according to official estimates , coming in ahead of the center - right @entity14 , which scored 20.8 % , and president @entity87 's @entity15 , which came in third with 14 %			1
even though the vote was for a regional legislative body , the potential impact on @entity2 's national political landscape was clear on sunday			1
the results sparked stunned reactions from some @entity2 politicians and triumphant victory speeches from others			0
@entity97 described the election as " a very serious moment for @entity2 and for @entity6 , " noting that projections indicate that voters are skeptical of the @entity55			1
" none of us can shirk their responsibilities , " he said , according to a summary of his remarks posted on the @entity2 government 's website			2
meanwhile , @entity1 leader @entity11 said the results showed that @entity2 voters wanted more control			2
" the sovereign people have proclaimed that they want to take back the reigns of their destiny into their hands			0
our people demand one type of politics : politics of the @entity2 , for the @entity2 , with the @entity2			0
they no longer want to be directed from outside , " she said			0
she said the vote shows that president @entity87 should dissolve @entity2 's parliament , where most lawmakers come from mainstream political parties			1
nearly 400 million @entity6 were eligible to vote in the parliamentary elections			2
turnout was just over 43 % , slightly higher than it was during the last vote in 2009 , @entity9 spokesman @entity128 said			0
" the clear message here is that people are unhappy with the way mainstream political parties have handled the economic crisis , and they 're giving them a good kicking , " said @entity132 , chairman of the @entity133			0
before the election , analysts predicted that protest parties were likely to triumph at the polls			0
those parties are demanding tighter border controls , nationalized decision - making and a dissolution of the currency union			0
but they have little in common aside from a dislike of the @entity153 bureaucracy , so it 's difficult for them to find much common ground , @entity57 said			0
" they can agree they do n't like the @entity55 , " @entity57 said , " but they ca n't agree what they like and what the answer is			0
" @entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report .			0

new : vote shows the @entity2 " no longer want to be directed from the outside , " @entity16 says
