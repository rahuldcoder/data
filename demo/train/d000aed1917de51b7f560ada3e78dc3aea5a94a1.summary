@entity0 -- the black - robed figure stares straight ahead , stalwart and silent , his head nodding appreciatively			2
he carries a big stick , which happens to have an @entity8 flag attached			2
and the man proudly stands on a toy truck and a pair of pizza boxes			2
say hello to the justice @entity13 , about the closest thing a member of the @entity17 gets to collectible immortality			2

" we have fun doing this , but it is a respectful project , " said @entity26 , a law professor at @entity27 in @entity28 and the creator of the series			2
" the rule of the bobblehead toy is that it 's not a joke			2
there 's a lesson here			2
we 're trying , in some way , to portray the important work of the court			1
" the 6 - inch limited edition figures originated eight years ago with then - chief justice @entity43			2

@entity53 is portrayed with the meticulous care that emphasizes his particular jurisprudence			1
in the 63 - year - old justice 's case , it 's his views on federalism , the idea that the @entity87 should be interpreted today as the founders had envisioned , rejecting calls by some progressives that the document should be considered in the current ever - changing social and political context			1
the flag @entity53 is holding refers to a concurrence in a 2004 case over whether the @entity96 should be recited by children in public schools			1

" " the hard part when designing the bobbleheads is to visually depict the court and its work , " said @entity124 , a @entity125 professor who collaborated on the design			1
" the court is so serious -- big cases and controversial decisions			1
this is a more light - hearted approach , a way to illustrate their work in a fun but intellectually thoughtful way			0
" @entity124 also clerked for @entity53 in his first year on the court in 1991			1
court sources say the justice was especially impressed and amused with his image and the highlighted jurisprudence			1
unlike the mass - produced bobbleheads , each justice is personally presented with just one of two handmade versions of their head - swiveling likeness			0
next up for bobblefication is justice @entity151 , perhaps next year			0
but at least one other member of the court has received the pop memorabilia treatment : @entity155 was the subject of a comic book last year -- " @entity162 " -- chronicling her pioneering work as the nation 's first @entity160 justice			1
sadly , she was portrayed wearing her robe rather than a cape with a superwoman - like " s " on it			0
