@entity0 -- @entity4 's beleaguered government huddled with various political parties wednesday , trying to come up with a way forward on an anti-corruption bill as ailing , elderly campaigner @entity2 continued his fast for a second day to protest legislation he slammed as too weak to deal with endemic graft			1
on tuesday , the national assembly 's lower chamber , the @entity14 , cleared the bill , aimed at creating a citizen ombudsman called the @entity18			1
however , after a marathon session , legislators defeated a key federal motion to accord constitutional powers to the new watchdog			1
now , the legislation is expected to be taken up by the upper house of elders , called the @entity27 , where the ruling @entity28 does not have a majority			1
in order for the anti-corruption bill to become a law , it has to be approved by both chambers of the @entity4 @entity35 with a majority vote			1
" we are talking to everyone and trying ( so ) that this bill gets passed in the @entity27 , " @entity37 , the country 's junior parliamentary affairs minister , told reporters wednesday			1
it is not immediately clear though when the bill will be debated in the upper chamber in the current , extended sitting of @entity35			1
meantime , a leading constitutional analyst feared that the legislation , even if it is passed into law , would become vulnerable to legal challenges for reserving slots for religious minorities in the proposed institution			1
" the ( @entity4 ) constitution allows no religion - based quotas , " noted @entity54 , a constitutional expert			1
slots in government establishments are only reserved for lower - castes , he said			1
" this bill is more political than a serious attempt to fight corruption , " @entity54 said			2
several political parties , including the @entity28 , are trying to woo @entity66 minority groups ahead of upcoming state elections , especially in @entity69 province , where the community forms a sizeable voting bloc , he explained			2
family scion @entity72 , son of @entity74 -- the @entity75 - born head of the @entity28 -- had earlier this year suggested a constitutional designation for the @entity18 to protect it from being dismantled by ordinary laws in the future			2
" huge slap on govt ( government ) 's face " read a stinging headline on the @entity81 newspaper wednesday , referring to the failed attempt at securing parliamentary approval for a constitutional status to the ombudsman			2
" @entity18 bill passes , statute change fails , " said a bold header on the @entity91 daily			1
meanwhile , @entity2 , who brought the corruption issue to the fore , fell ill while keeping up his hunger strike			1
doctors warned him to end his fast as did his supporters , while ambulances stood by at the @entity103 commercial complex where the elderly crusader was staging his protest , his third this year			2
in his remarks tuesday , prime minister @entity106 defended his government 's bill stoutly			2
" there are some very special moments in the life of a nation			2
this is one such moment , " @entity106 said during the @entity14 debate			0
" others can persuade and have their voices heard , " he said , alluding to @entity2			1
" but the decision must rest with us			0
... we have seen how public anger has manifested itself in the last one year			0
let us , therefore , endorse this bill as proposed			0
" but opposition leaders said @entity106 was leading a corrupt party -- @entity28 's reputation has been marred by scandals -- that had put forth a weak anti-graft bill			1
in a new @entity129 survey published last week , 64 % of @entity4 said they had paid a bribe to police , the highest corruption rate of any institution			0
and less than a quarter of those surveyed thought their government 's efforts to fight corruption were effective			0
one point of contention in the proposed legislation is that it excludes the @entity143 or federal police from the purview of the @entity18			0
" without an investigative agency , what is the purpose of @entity18 ? " @entity2 said in a december 17 letter			1
" it 's better we do n't have such a @entity18			0
" corruption has been a part of daily life in @entity4 for many years			0
but it was a series of high - profile scandals that rocked the current administration and investor confidence in @entity159 's third - largest economy			0
in april , a former government minister was among a dozen defendants charged in a multibillion - dollar telecom scandal			0
@entity163 , a former telecommunication minister , is accused of being involved in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of @entity4 's lucrative telecom boom			0
police have questioned several high - profile executives in connection with the suspected below - price sale of radiowaves or broadcast spectrum in 2008			0
politicians , bureaucrats , and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing			0
investigators also probed complaints of financial malfeasance in the @entity183 that @entity4 hosted in october last year			0
several politicians , military officials , and bureaucrats have also been the subjects of a separate inquiry for allegedly taking apartments meant for war widows .			0
