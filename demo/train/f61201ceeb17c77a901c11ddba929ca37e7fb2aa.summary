-- when even the most secluded beach on the mainland is too crowded , there 's always the option of renting a private island for your vacation			1
many would require every credit card you 've got and more , but others are a little more within reach -- especially if you rent with a group of friends			1
whether you 're planning or dreaming , here are a few extraordinary places to get away from it all : @entity17 , @entity18 @entity18 royal chiefs once liked to head to @entity17 in the @entity21 group for a little @entity22			1
you too can be chief of your kingdom for about $ 39,000 a night ( make that a mere $ 34,000 or so during low season )			1
the 225 - acre island accommodates up to 90 people , and with a staff of 120 , you wo n't lack for assistance in nearly any activity you want to pursue			1
snorkeling above coral reefs , paddle boarding , glass bottom kayaking , windsurfing and daily fish feeding are included in the rate			0
@entity39 's 100 best beaches hike up @entity17 for another perspective on the aqua waters of the @entity42			0
another memorable event is the @entity44 and @entity45 night			0
the meal comes from the lovo , a traditional @entity18 underground cooking pit , and the high spirits from the meke , an evening of traditional dances and song			1
easier on the wallet : garden villas for two run about $ 1,000 per night ; beachfront villas cost about $ 1,300 per night			1
@entity56 , @entity57 remember the sirens , those beautiful women who lured sailors to their death on craggy shores ? some say they lived at @entity64 , a private island that now sleeps up to 13 nonsiren types for just shy of $ 200,000 per week			1
the island is well - positioned just minutes off the @entity68 , a @entity69			2
you 'd expect a private @entity72 island to attract celebrities , and you 'd be right			2
@entity74 and @entity75 have been among @entity56 's guests , and the island was once home to the great @entity80 dancer @entity79			2
be forewarned : a pad for landing your helicopter is included , but engaging the 115 - foot yacht requires an extra fee			0
a dramatic stone - and - white chapel is available if matrimony calls you			0
the island is only available by the week , so start negotiating with your well - to - do friends			1
@entity91 's best little beach towns @entity92 , @entity93 @entity95 's @entity94 is currently a steal starting at $ 42,500 per night while its @entity98 is being rebuilt -- after that , the price goes up			1
but if you 're looking for other options in the area , @entity92 starts at about half that -- roughly $ 22,000 nightly for up to 32 guests -- with seven beaches , a tennis court , sailboats and pedal boats , more than a dozen trails and a spa among its amenities			1
( a massage overlooking the @entity113 sounds pretty good about now			0
) experienced divers gravitate to the @entity116 's deep reefs and underwater cave			0
in august and october , the academically minded appreciate the chance to join visiting scientists in their pursuits , from rebuilding coral reefs to tagging iguanas			0
speaking of which , the island draws its name from a rock outcropping that resembles the head of the tropical lizard			2
easier on the wallet : if a five - digit price tag is not in the budget ( and is pretty much permanently out of the question ) , you can forgo reserving the entire island and share the 850 - acre expanse with a few dozen other guests			1
rates for a cottage or villa for two start at about $ 700 and $ 1,500 , respectively			1
@entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 in 1966 , dr. @entity142 , one of the forces behind the creation of the @entity145 , brought 16 chimps from @entity72 zoos to @entity139 in @entity141 to give them a safe haven			0
the chimps thrived on the island , also home to elephants , giraffes and hippos			2
and it 's available to you , for $ 4,500 a night , along with up to 15 friends			1
guests at @entity160 , which opened in late 2012 , can get a @entity162 - style experience by tracking chimps through the forest and observing their behavior with specialist guides			0
more traditional game drives are also available			0
if that 's not enough , some 300 species of birds have been spotted here			0
the lodge and its eight suites feature thatch roofs , curved walls and traditional @entity176 fabrics			0
easier on the wallet : ca n't find 15 takers for this trip ? do n't fret , there 's a starting per - person nightly rate of $ 620 for double occupancy that includes meals , drinks and activities			2
@entity187 , @entity188 living in tents may not sound like luxury , but the tents at @entity192 are n't anything like the canopy you hoisted at scout camp			0
each villa on this private island in the @entity188 includes three tented spaces for living , sleeping and bathing			2
think timber flooring and rattan and teak furniture , not sleeping bags and mosquitos			0
add a private plunge pool for each villa , a personal chef and waiter , and activities such as water skiing , dolphin cruises , night fishing and a @entity188 cooking school			2
many visitors say it feels like a private island even when there are other guests , but those who want to be sure can spring for the whole island buyout , currently available at a special rate of $ 9,420 per night for up to 12 people , with a minimum four - night stay			1
easier on the wallet : tent villa rates start at $ 2,355 per night			1
the special whole - island rate may be the most economical option this summer -- provided you can round up a group , airfare and about $ 40,000			1
@entity232 , @entity233 @entity232 is proof that island adventure does n't have to be limited to warm - weather climes			2
from @entity237 , @entity233 , it 's just a half - hour water taxi ride to @entity239 , where @entity240 and @entity241 have created an unusual vacation retreat			0
guests can view humpback and orca whales , sea lions , harbor seals , porpoises and river otters right from each yurt 's private deck or the island 's common areas			2
( incredibly , humpback whales often visit just feet from the island			2
) kayaks , stand - up paddle boards , rowing skiff and fishing gear are included in the full facility rate of $ 2,150 per night , which covers all five yurts			1
easier on the wallet : the 2013 per - person rate is $ 215 per night for a two - night minimum , based on double occupancy			0
in 2014 , that rate will be $ 225 per person , per night			0
@entity269 , @entity270 with weekday rates of $ 600 per night for up to 12 guests , you 'd be forgiven for assuming @entity269 is a forlorn rock at the start of nowhere			1
it 's actually a 10 - acre isle off the coast of @entity270 , surrounded by salt marsh that 's a lovely setting for crabbing			1
transportation to and from the island is included , and boat rentals are available if you want to explore and fish the surrounding waters of the @entity285 and the @entity286			1
the lodge with huge wraparound porch sleeps 12 and is built largely of recycled materials , such as vintage brick			0
@entity291 , rejoice : along with the standard kitchen , an outdoor setup includes seafood steamers , low country boil cook stations , smoker with wood chips and other tools for your blue crab dinner			0
you can even arrange to get the kitchen stocked before you arrive			0
other gathering spots tend to be the outdoor fireplace and hot tub , not to mention the romantic appeal of the outdoor shower			0
easier on the wallet : why not gather a dozen friends for a weekly rental ? six nights run $ 3,300 .			1

about $ 200,000 among friends will buy you a weeklong @entity314 dream
many of the island rental options offer more *affordable* rates if you share with *strangers*
island rentals range from *pristine* beach havens in @entity18 to quiet fishing *outposts* in @entity270
