-- a well - placed pool of water and an air pocket appear to have combined to help a young woman survive for 16 days under the rubble of a collapsed @entity7 building			1
the woman , who was pulled out friday from the remains of the garment factory , was found in that pool of water , rescue official lt. col. @entity8 told @entity0			1
it would have been crucial to her survival , @entity0 's dr. @entity14 said			1
the woman , known only as @entity18 , 19 , was able to use an iron rod to get workers ' attention and cry out to them , " i 'm alive			2
please rescue me , " according to capt. @entity22 , a @entity7 military official outside the recovery operation			0
the rescue was a bright spot against the grim recovery			0
the death toll from the april 24 collapse is more than 1,000			0
the woman reportedly was in a partially collapsed room and had access to an air pocket , which @entity14 said is " obviously , the most crucial thing			1
" in addition , " having some access to water must have happened here , " he noted			2
the source of the pool of water was unclear			1
@entity42 may have trickled to the building 's basement , where @entity18 was found , from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers			2
firefighters had hosed down the area to extinguish a fire that erupted during a failed rescue attempt			0
@entity14 said the woman likely had some sort of access to food , although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it			1
he said it was " somewhat surprising " that @entity18 would have been able to call out to rescuers , as " even that requires a fair amount of energy			0
" asked how long someone can survive without food or water , @entity14 said , " we keep redefining that a bit			1
" he recalled the case of @entity70 , a then - 28 - year - old man who was pulled alive from a building in @entity72 , @entity73 , about four weeks after a january 2010 earthquake that leveled much of the city			2
it is believed @entity77 had some access to food and water , although details remain murky , he said			2
also , @entity18 's youth may have worked in her favor , he said			0
" the body can be very good at preserving itself			2
" a body can enter a state known as starvation ketosis , @entity14 said , in which it utilizes muscles and other sorts of protein to feed itself			1
state - run news agency @entity91 ( @entity91 ) reported @entity18 told her rescuers that she survived on dry food and water that was tossed into the rubble in the first days after the collapse			1
" i ate biscuits and water , " she told rescuers , according to the news agency , " but the stock dwindled two days ago			0
" @entity18 told doctors at a military hospital , where she was taken , that she was wracked by third for the past two days			0
she spent the entire time in the dark between floors that had collapsed , according to the @entity91 report			0
while @entity18 's outlook is favorable , food will have to be reintroduced slowly , @entity14 said , noting that @entity77 had lost 30 pounds while buried under the @entity73 rubble			1
" my guess is , she 's extremely weak , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
