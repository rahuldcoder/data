-- in the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria - tainted cantaloupe , authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than @entity10 's @entity9 is safe			1
but if in doubt about a fruit 's origin , they said , it 's best to throw it out			1
the outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported september 12			1
as of wednesday , it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people , officials with the @entity21 said			2
the number of cases is expected to rise , as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms			2
all of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at @entity9 in @entity32 , @entity10 , although they were shipped to 17 states -- @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity10 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49			1
" it 's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not @entity9 , then it 's ok to eat , " @entity21 director @entity50 told reporters during a conference call wednesday			1
" but if you 're in doubt , then throw it out			2
" the recalled cantaloupes may bear a green - and - white sticker that says , " product of @entity64 - @entity63 - @entity62 , " or a gray , yellow and green sticker that says , " @entity68			0
" but not all cantaloupes may have a sticker , @entity50 said			0
consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from			2
if the cantaloupe 's origins remain unconfirmed , it should be disposed of , he said			1
however , the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation 's food supply is decreasing , thanks to the fruit 's short shelf life -- about two weeks , officials said			1
the recalled cantaloupes were shipped from july 29 through september 10 , " so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product , " @entity88 , a senior adviser with the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , told reporters			0
the recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves , she said , but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer			0
" but consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect , " she said			2
if consumers do have a cantaloupe from @entity9 , authorities recommend they do n't try to wash off the bacteria			1
" we want you to throw that product away , " @entity88 said			0
the fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can , to prevent people or animals from eating them , the @entity21 said			0
refrigeration will not kill the @entity121 bacteria , which can grow even at low temperatures , officials said			1
and the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator , the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow			1
" it is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces " in order to minimize risk , the @entity89 says on its website			2
after washing refrigerators , cutting boards and countertops , the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used			0
@entity9 has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season , so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market , @entity89 commissioner @entity144 said wednesday			1
although @entity9 does produce other products , there is no concern for any other product from the company , @entity88 said			1
listeriosis causes fever , muscle aches , diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms			0
it rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults , the @entity21 said , but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems			0
it can be treated with antibiotics			0
the source of the outbreak -- the deadliest @entity64 outbreak of a food - borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation			0
officials could not give a figure wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled .			0

health officials say the only contaminated fruit is from @entity9
if consumers do n't know where a melon came from , they can ask the store
if there is any doubt about a cantaloupe 's origin , it should be thrown out , officials say
consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria
