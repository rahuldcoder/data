@entity0 -- in @entity0 the smell of fish wafting from the docks and the canneries is the smell of money			1
and lately , the town has smelled a lot less fishy			0
high seas high jinx : @entity11 gives his shipmate @entity12 a haircut at sea using a sail bag as a barber cape			1
over fishing , new quota systems and changes in expected weather patterns have all played a role in changing the face of this once swashbuckling @entity26 town , fishermen say			1
" last summer we thought that pollock fishing was over for good , it was so bad			2
time to turn out the lights and go home			0
but then they cut the quotas by 30 percent and now there are some small signs of more small fish , so maybe they are coming back , " said @entity32 , who coordinates with fishing captains who unload their catch at the @entity37 docks in @entity0			1
" the fishermen have to go further north toward @entity44 now to get the fish that are near the ice			0
it used to be the boats would go out 100 miles , now they go out 500			0
it could be partly due to temperature change and weather patterns			1
" @entity0 saw a revival in popularity with the reality show the @entity55 , but even the high - fiving enthusiasm of the deck hands on the tv show ca n't match what the town was like in the glory days			1
" those were the days , in the mid 1980 's , there was booze , drugs and partying			2
you had lines of coke going down the bar and no one said anything , " says @entity67 , captain of the 24 - ton fishing boat the @entity69			2
" people were making big money and spending it as fast as it came in			2
i earned $ 78,000 as a deckhand the first year i was here but i ca n't remember where it went			0
those days are long gone			0
" aboard the @entity85 , as we sail north through the @entity86 , we 're finding other things are not quite like they used to be			1
for starters , we 've been becalmed for much of the trip when we were expecting to encounter strong winds on the @entity91 and @entity86			2
we have motored nearly half of our 2,300 miles so far			0
more importantly , the ice we were bracing ourselves for may not be where we expected to find it			0
while this is good news for the expedition from a sailing perspective , it 's less attractive for wildlife such as polar bears , seals and walruses that use the ice as a platform for hunting , mating and migration			1
" the present extent of northern sea ice is very similar to the extents at this time in 2008 and in 2007			0
it is close to values seen also in 1995 and 1990			0
it is about five per cent below the long - term average of 12.2m square kilometers , " said dr @entity114 , a research scientist with the @entity115 near @entity116 , @entity117			0
september 2007 was the first time that the @entity121 was open water from end to end			0
an ice forecast issued by the @entity126 on july 1 showed earlier than normal break up in many key areas in the @entity129			1
" in the @entity129 region , the breakup pattern is one to three weeks early in many coastal areas and by as much as one month in isolated areas , " the report said			1
but we 're still some 400 miles from the @entity136 and a month from entering the heart of the @entity121 , which gives the @entity129 plenty of time to surprise us .			1
