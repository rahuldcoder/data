-- hotel guests across the continent are not happy			1
at least that 's the conclusion from a survey released wednesday by @entity5			2
right down the line , the 2012 @entity6 ticks off a laundry list of items that are dragging the industry to its lowest satisfaction level since 2006 : check - in / check - out , food and beverage , hotel services and facilities			1
one item in particular -- internet costs and fees -- is pressing some guests ' buttons , churning up " resentment , frustration and anger , " says @entity24 , a @entity25 vice president			0
" at the luxury level , where they 're paying for a lot more , there 's a feeling you should be giving more freebies , like @entity33 , which many lower priced hotels offer for free			1
" the anger is rooted in this cultural shift : we 're at a tipping point where hotel guests value internet access as they would a bed and hot water , says @entity24			1
" you ca n't live without it			0
" 10 budget all - inclusive resorts to hammer the point home , let 's state the obvious : hotels are not going to be charging a fee to have a bed included in your room			1
" it matters to me , " says @entity55 , a @entity56 - based real estate agent who says he always looks for hotel @entity57 , especially when vacationing overseas			1
it 's not as important in the @entity61 , he says , because he can surf on his phone			0
but , " internationally it gets real expensive real fast to use @entity65			0
" for the data heads , here are the stats : @entity25 gathered information from thousands of consumers about their overall satisfaction about hotel costs and fees			2
the rating plunged 76 points this year : 16 points lower than last year 's survey			1
@entity5 blames it on hotel @entity33 charges			0
fifty - five percent of hotel guests use the internet during their hotel stay , the study says , up from 20 % in 2006			1
of those , 87 % connect by @entity57			2
eleven percent of guests who use the @entity33 said they paid an additional fee to connect			0
rules and rates for luxury hotel internet access are far from universal			1
some luxury hotels offer internet access for members of loyalty programs , like @entity97 's @entity96 , although some @entity99 - @entity98 provide free internet access in hotel lobbies			1
wiring a hotel for @entity57 can be pricier than one might expect			1
a line capable of delivering 100 megabits of data per second can cost in the range of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 per month , says @entity106 , a veteran hotel consultant for internet infrastructure			0
he says an upscale @entity109 hotel he 's familiar with has two 20 megabit connections with a monthly cost between $ 700 to $ 800 each			2
" it is expensive , " says @entity112 of the @entity113			0
" and somebody has to pay for it			0
" he says high - end hotels are n't able to add another $ 15 or $ 20 to their room rates , which is why they charge the fees			2
" if you 're not going to use it , then why should you pay for it ? " competition at budget and moderately priced hotels is more intense because consumers often make their hotel choices based solely on price			1
they expect rates with amenities rolled in			0
at a luxury hotel , breakfast will cost you			1
budget hotels are likely to throw in coffee and a bagel			0
confessions of a hotel mystery shopper what really gets guests ' goat , according to the survey , is when hotels charge for internet via so - called " resort fees			1
" nickel and diming fuels resentment , @entity24 says , because guests feel like they 're being charged extra for something they give away down the street at the neighborhood coffee shop			0
industry experts see increased use of a tiered system of web access , perhaps offering basic @entity33 free and then charging for higher data access for things like watching video or playing online games			2
not only do hotel guests want more bandwidth , they also want to use more devices in their rooms -- cell phones , laptops and tablets			1
many hotels seem to be behind the tech curve			0
" it 's part of the whole catch - up , " says @entity24			1
" hotels are still trying to run on the lower cost structure from the economic downturn			2
" consumer demands are bouncing back with the economy , he says , but hotels are n't catching up quickly enough			0
" internet access is a big part of that			0
" the cost and fees data is part of a larger survey of more than 61,000 hotel guests from the @entity61 and @entity187			1
overall , the survey has a 1,000 - point scale			2
this year 's overall score is 757 , which is down seven points from last year , measured across seven types of hotels , from economy / budget to extended stay to luxury			1
the @entity97 topped the survey in the luxury category with 864 points			2
in the economy / budget bracket , @entity200 received 751			0
other top hotels in their categories included @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0

a new part of the annual survey examines opinions of hotel staff			0
fifty - six percent of respondents said they had a high opinion of hotel staff , 34 % said average and 10 % said their opinion was low			2
experts suggested that hotels were slow to respond to rising consumer expectations as the nation 's economy improves			0
