-- @entity2 's government has stepped in at the eleventh hour to help save an @entity2 woman on death row in @entity6 from being executed this weekend			1
@entity7 , a 40 - year old working as a housemaid in the @entity11 kingdom , was sentenced to death in 2011 after she reportedly admitted to killing her 70 - year - old female employer and stealing approximately $ 10,000			1
she said it was in self - defense as her boss had been trying to attack her at the time			0
she was facing execution on saturday unless the dead woman 's family received 7 million @entity6 riyals ( $ 1.8 million ) in financial compensation , known as diyya or " blood money			1
" a pardon would likely follow if the payment is made			0
campaigners in @entity2 had raised just over half that sum with donations coming from the public , businesses and @entity33 , @entity27 's @entity26 said in a statement last week			2
but on thursday , a statement on the official website of the @entity2 president 's @entity37 confirmed that @entity2 's government would pay the full amount -- a figure that had been negotiated down from an initial request of 10 million @entity6 riyals , @entity2 @entity26 official @entity42 told @entity0 in february			1
" with the government 's offer to pay 7 million riyals , coordinating minister for political and security affairs , @entity46 , said @entity7 has been saved from the death penalty , at the @entity49 prison in @entity6 , " the statement read			2
the statement quoted @entity46 as saying a task force representing the @entity2 government had met with @entity6 officials and the dead woman 's family on wednesday when a figure was agreed			1
he did not confirm whether the family had made any additional demands			0
@entity6 authorities have yet to confirm whether the execution will be canceled			2
letter to the king the execution was initially scheduled for august 2011 but has been postponed five times due to the intervention of the @entity2 government , @entity27 's @entity26 said			1
@entity64 has written @entity65 twice over the last two years , while @entity67 's brother and daughter have also written a letter to the victim 's family , according to the ministry			0
some 41 other @entity2 workers face possible death sentences in @entity6 on charges ranging from black magic to stealing , adultery and murder , according to the @entity2 @entity26 and local nonprofit groups			2
in 2011 , @entity2 housemaid @entity80 was pardoned after the @entity2 government paid the required compensation of 2 million riyals ( $ 533,000 )			1
she had been sentenced to death two years before for murdering a relative of her @entity85 employer in @entity6			0

@entity88 , also an @entity2 maid working in @entity6 , was executed in june 2011 for allegedly killing her employer			1

moratorium the @entity2 government later announced a full moratorium on sending workers to the @entity11 kingdom , which ended in february when the two governments signed a new agreement guaranteeing domestic workers a monthly wage , time off and contact with loved ones			1
human rights groups say the pact is a step toward ensuring the protection of foreign workers ' basic rights in @entity6			0
