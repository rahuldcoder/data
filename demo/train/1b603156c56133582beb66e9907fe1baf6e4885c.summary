-- at the end of a bitter political season too often hijacked by the extremes , the @entity1 was a heartening reaffirmation of @entity6 humor , smarts and civility			1
this year 's previous political rallies on the @entity11 mall -- @entity13 's " @entity18 " rally and the labor / liberal corollary " @entity17 " rally emceed by @entity16 -- seemed like grim partisan marches compared to the optimism of this overflowing crowd composed of @entity6 from the sensible center			1
while @entity13 asked his supporters not to bring signs ( presumably for fear of the distractions they might create ) and @entity29 's rally signs were mostly printed up by unions and activist groups , the signs at the @entity34 rally were clearly homemade			1
and like hosts @entity35 and @entity37 , they used satire to comment on the political insanity that surrounds us			2
among the signs i saw : @entity43 hates @entity44 the rant is @entity46 restrain the craziness @entity48 was an @entity49 @entity50 for staying in the @entity51 @entity52 : at @entity53 he is n't @entity54 @entity55 was @entity55 want @entity56 ? move to @entity57 ( not that there 's anything wrong with that ... ) real @entity61 can handle a difference of opinion real @entity6 do n't use the @entity64 ' @entity63 ' i read the @entity66 for the articles i masturbate and i vote moderate to the @entity69 the content from the stage was essentially a comedy show mixed with musical guests			1
the message was communicated mostly in " show do n't tell " sketches			2
in one , @entity77 , the artist formerly known as @entity77 , came out to play the hippie anthem " @entity86 , " interrupted by @entity79 playing " @entity80 " -- culminating with the @entity81 " @entity82 , " a train we can all get on board			0
but the crowd was making a fairly consistent , if irreverent , political statement -- from the couple who drove up from @entity90 with a sign that quoted from a ' 70s pop song : " clowns to the left of me , jokers to the right , here i am -- stuck in the middle with you , " to a sign that read , " what do we want ? moderation ! when do we want it ? in a reasonable timeframe ! " college students from @entity106 made their point for the media : " can we get some airtime , please ? -- the moderates			1
" " i think there 's too much polarization going on -- and of course the squeaky wheel gets the grease , " said @entity111 of @entity112 , whose husband was laid off last year			0
she was holding a sign that read " one of the @entity120			0
" " and so the extremists on both ends are the ones screaming the loudest and so the rest of us are in the middle thinking that we 're not being heard			0
" another woman held a sign that quoted legendary journalist @entity129 : " we will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason			0
" some partisan journalists tried to spin the rally as just a liberal event , but they missed the point by reinforcing the idea that has helped get us into this mess : that if you 're not with us , you 're against us ; that if you 're not conservative , you 're liberal			1
in fact , the only two signs i saw for actual candidates running this fall were for independents @entity148 and @entity150			0
and while there was no shortage of anger expressed , at @entity154 in particular , at what other rally would you see a sign that read : " @entity158 and @entity159 : both @entity160			2
" more opinion on topics in the news in comparing rallies , size matters -- and having covered the conservative and liberal rallies on the mall earlier this year , i can tell you that the @entity34 rally was much larger			1
this is fitting , because there are more americans in the center than those who are on the right or left			0
and there are certainly more @entity6 who prefer the leavening effects of laughter to ideological fear - mongering			1
but for all the humor and affirmation , the @entity34 rally ultimately had a serious point that will apply when the election is over -- namely , that we have to work together to solve problems , but our polarized politics and the partisan media are stopping our ability to reason together as @entity6			1
as @entity35 said in his instant classic of a closing speech : " why would you work with @entity193 actively subverting our @entity66 or racists and homophobes who see no one 's humanity but their own ? we hear every damn day about how fragile our country is -- on the brink of catastrophe -- torn by polarizing hate , and how it 's a shame that we ca n't work together to get things done			0
but the truth is we do			0
we work together to get things done every damn day			0
the only place we do n't is here [ in @entity11 ] or on cable tv			0
" so this celebration of sanity and humor came with a challenge to hyperpartisans in politics and media -- stop playing to the lowest common denominator , stop trying to divide @entity6 in an attempt to conquer			1
the @entity6 people are smart and " most @entity6 do n't live their lives solely as @entity219 or @entity220 or conservatives or liberals , " as @entity35 remarked			2
the rally 's size and enthusiasm was evidence of a growing demand for something different -- an alternative to predictable talking points and the partisan spin cycle , a desire for humor and honesty , independence and integrity			1
it is both an opportunity and an obligation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

@entity242 : the " @entity34 " rally *emphasized* moderation and humor
he says the big crowd yearned for an alternative to extreme partisanship
@entity242 says some tried to spin it as a liberal event , but the real theme was a centrist one
@entity259 should " stop trying to divide @entity6 in an attempt to conquer , " he says
