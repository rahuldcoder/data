-- the @entity1 " 6 - pack " is visiting the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , this week to learn more about biking , swimming and running			1
like many newcomers to the sport of triathlon , they 've made some mistakes early on			1
this trip , halfway through the training , is about fixing those mistakes			1
i 've trained three groups of @entity1 triathletes , and over the years i 've come up with five simple rules all beginners should follow : 1			1
find a love for each discipline			0
it 's ok not to love every training session , but i think it 's important to enjoy your time swimming , biking and running			1
it 's important to view this time as a gift -- as an opportunity for adventure , improved fitness and overall better quality of life			1
the triathlon industry is fast paced and high tech , based on the demographic of the sports participants			0
do n't get lost in the heart rate , wattage , newest gadget , latest diet plan or running shoe			2
at the end of the day , the sport is simply : swim			1
i am not saying some of these gadgets wo n't help your progression as an athlete , but they are not all necessary , especially not early in your training			2
do n't get lost in the hype and the information overload			0
do not avoid the sport you favor the least			2
it is human nature to do what we are more familiar with more frequently			0
if you are a weak swimmer , however , your swim will not improve by running three to four times a week and swimming only one to two times a week			1
aim for balance in your training rather than avoidance			2
write your own plan , find a training plan online or work with a coach			1
choose the path that is the best fit			0
a plan will help you reach your goals , create balance in training and help prevent injury			2
do n't worry about the finish line			0
stay in the present throughout your triathlon progression			0
break things up into manageable pieces and check them off as you accomplish bench marks			0
for example , break your first 4 - mile run effort into 2 x 2 - mile efforts			0
do n't think about the second effort until you have accomplished the first			0
acknowledge the accomplishment of the first 2 - mile effort as you continue moving forward into the second part of the effort			0
