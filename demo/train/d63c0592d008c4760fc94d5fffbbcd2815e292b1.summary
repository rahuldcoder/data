@entity0 , @entity1 -- no one at the @entity4 in the heart of @entity0 quite remembers if @entity6 , the father of the 44th @entity8 president , ever played here when he was a high - flying civil servant in the 1960s			1
perhaps he played up the road at the @entity11 , the oldest of the city 's six golf establishments , someone suggests			2
the club scene was certainly the natural ecosystem for the pipe - smoking @entity19 - educated economist , and the hordes of other young @entity21 just returned from the world 's top universities to take over their newly independent country			1
map : @entity26 weighs in on @entity8 election memories of dr. @entity6 are fading , but his son is a popular man in @entity1			1
from the clubs to the teeming barrios for which @entity0 is notorious , president @entity6 is spoken of with enthusiasm and pride			1
dr. @entity34 , is in the pharmaceuticals business and a widely travelled man			0
he thinks the world of president @entity6			1
" i believe he deserves a second term			0
war is very expensive and with the @entity44 and @entity45 war , he has done a great job in managing this and even eliminating @entity48 [ @entity48 ] , " said @entity34 at the @entity41 , whose course is part of a longer green belt that girdles @entity0 's fat midriff from south to north			1
postcard : @entity53 enjoy election soap opera the @entity1 capital is a land of dramatic contrasts			1
from a rooftop bar on @entity61 , the main highway to the airport and on to the coast , you can sometimes see in the distance herds of buffalo , giraffe and the odd lion			0
once in a while , when the big cats wander into the villages and kill their cattle , @entity69 warriors take out their spears and hunt them down			0
it is a city that likes to keep in touch with its wild side			0
@entity78 , @entity1 's biggest slum , is obamaland			1
here , the people are less guarded , more passionate about politics			0
their living conditions are terrible			0
they have given rise to a peculiar activity , slum tourism , where wealthy people journey from all over the world to come and see squalor			0
the ring of slums to the south co-exist cheek - to - jowl with @entity94 , one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods			2
every morning crowds of workers stream through @entity94 for their 15 - kilometer walk to the city 's industrial zone			2
postcard : @entity6 finds support among @entity104 in @entity78 , @entity6 's story resonates strongly maybe because when you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel , the only thing keeping you going is a dream : the slum is home to amazing innovation and creativity in film , comedy , music and -- believe it not -- @entity118			1
@entity119 , 25 , sells charcoal , used by thousands of poor household for fuel			0
" the highlight of his term was killing @entity48 , which is something other presidents have not been successful in doing , " he says			1
@entity127 and its fanatical @entity129 affiliate , @entity128 , which has been carrying out a campaign of terror in @entity0 and on one occasion lobbed a grenade into a @entity134 , is solidly hated			0
postcard : why @entity136 , @entity8 are kindred spirits unlike many @entity1 , @entity119 did n't wake up at 4:00 a.m. to watch the second @entity8 presidential debate on tv			1
@entity1 will hold its own general election next march , and for the first time a series of presidential debates has been planned ahead of election day			1
he says he will watch the local ones			0
for @entity1 's @entity148 , however , the attitude towards @entity8 is more complex			1
@entity149 , 35 , another @entity78 resident , is full of praise for @entity6 , whom he describes as " a very eloquent speaker with a very good grasp of national matters , especially on managing the economy " -- before adding , " i will not comment on terrorism			1
" postcard : war - scarred @entity157 has little faith in election among @entity148 , there is suspicion that the fight against @entity127 targets their religion -- and @entity8 campaign talk of an invasion of @entity165 and the enthusiastic support for @entity167 are not popular ideas in the mosques			0
the thrill here over @entity6 's 2008 election has dwindled over time			1
" enthusiasm for president @entity6 is probably 40 percent what it was in 2008 , " said @entity173 , foreign editor of the @entity174 , @entity1 's biggest newspaper			1
" people used to call and demand that i publish @entity6 's pictures and stories			1
" in 2008 , the @entity174 sent a team to cover the @entity8 election ; this year it is relying on its correspondents and the wire services			0
while @entity6 is admired because he is smart , calm and dignified , a brave black man doing his duty for his country , he has been in office for four years and the novelty has worn off			2
postcard : @entity6 's ' hope ' a mirage for hostile @entity193 @entity1 perception of @entity8 has also changed over the years			1
the @entity8 is recognized as a powerful actor not just in regional affairs , but in national affairs			0
there is a growing belief in @entity1 that @entity8 exercises its immense power only in its own interest -- sort of like a wealthy friend who comes to a party with lots of food , but does not share			2
last october , @entity1 forces crossed the border into @entity129 in pursuit of @entity128			2
the region 's first contact with jihadist terrorism was in august 1998 when @entity127 bombed the @entity8 embassies in @entity0 and @entity213			0
there was an outpouring of sympathy for @entity8			0
but when @entity1 forces entered @entity129 , the @entity8 stayed out of it			2
@entity217 , who sells software , feels @entity6 has not been sufficiently engaged with @entity21			2
while his predecessors had big initiatives such as the @entity221 , and the @entity222 , which offers @entity21 companies preferential access to the @entity8 textiles market , @entity6 has been pre-occupied with domestic issues			2
postcard : @entity6 , @entity228 ignore @entity45 at own peril @entity8 also uses travel advisories to chide the @entity1 government for policies with which it disagrees , according to @entity217			1
" placing travel advisories on countries like @entity1 because of a few security threats is not the way to go , because we do not do the same when @entity8 has had its share of scares , " said @entity217 , echoing the common perception that the @entity8 government uses travel advisories , which discourage travel to countries at risk , as a big stick to get the @entity1 government to do its bidding			2
in @entity250 , a village about 400 kilometers west of @entity0 and the home of the @entity253 , a victory party is being planned			0
at the @entity255 , golfers pay no heed to the scorching sun and are out on the green			0
in the club house , members speak quietly into their cell phones			0
a few are on their @entity263 , most likely keeping a worried eye on @entity265 to see which ones are leaning and which ones are toss - ups .			0

president @entity6 's father , @entity270 , was born in @entity1
@entity6 fervor has faded since 2008 , but he remains source of pride for @entity1
many @entity1 believe the killing of @entity48 is @entity6 's top *achievement*
