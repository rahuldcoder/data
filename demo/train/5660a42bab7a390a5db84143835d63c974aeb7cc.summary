-- on friday , august 4 , 1944 -- a beautiful summer morning , not unlike the one on which i am writing this now -- a car pulled up in front of a spice warehouse at 263 @entity8 in @entity9			2
inside the car were an @entity13 @entity12 officer and his @entity15 subordinates , who , acting on a tip - off ( whose source has never been identified ) , had come to arrest the eight @entity18 who had been hiding for two years in an attic above the warehouse			2
the eight prisoners were taken to a deportation camp , from where they were sent to @entity24			2
only one of them , @entity25 , would survive			0
it is because of one of youngest of those prisoners , @entity28 -- 15 at the time of her arrest -- that we know the names of the people who endured under those extraordinary circumstances , and who tried heroically to lead normal lives , although , during the daylight hours , they were forbidden to move or make noise			0
the diary that @entity28 had received for her 13th birthday , which she had kept up during their time in the " secret annex , " and which she had revised during her family 's last few months in hiding , has outlived her by decades			1
it has become a classic of world literature , translated , reprinted and read throughout the world			0
she made her final entry in the diary 70 years ago friday , sounding like a typical soul - searching adolescent			1
often , reading @entity54 's diary is the way in which young people first learn about the horrors of the @entity59 genocide			1
just as importantly , young readers understand that these crimes were visited upon a girl much like themselves and their friends -- a girl who was often in conflict with her mother , a girl who kept vowing to be a more patient and forgiving person , a girl who fell in love for the first time			0
a girl who wanted to be a writer -- and who was one			0
though the circumstances of her final years ( she died , at 15 , in @entity76 ) were so terrible and extreme , her inner life and her voice seem almost shockingly contemporary , astonishingly similar to the voices of the teenagers we know			1
we can not help but be amazed that an adolescent girl could have written so movingly and intelligently about a subject that continues to overwhelm the adult imagination			0
because of this book , we will remember the names , the quirks -- the characters -- of the eight people who inhabited the secret annex and their brave @entity15 helpers			1
we will be able to visualize them long after everyone who witnessed that horrific era is gone			0
it is because of @entity28 's diary that she and her family are among the few we will remember -- the ones we feel we know -- among the millions who suffered and died as she did			1
all of this should bolster the argument to be made against those who wish to remove some literature from the curriculum that our children study because it is not " practical , " not " useful , " because literature ( like @entity54 's diary ) is a frivolous luxury compared with the more " necessary " subjects that today 's young people must master			1
what could be more " practical " than to learn ( from the inside , from the first - person point of view of someone who experienced it ) the history of the world in which we live , the history that has made us who we are -- and to learn that this history happened not to anonymous masses but to individuals much like ourselves and our children			2
what could be more " useful " than to view that era through the mind and eyes -- and in the words -- of a girl who wanted us to know who she was and what happened to her			0
and what could be more necessary than the story of a girl who wanted to grow up , to become a writer , to lead a full and normal life -- and was prevented from doing so , by the forces of prejudice and hatred , on a beautiful and otherwise ordinary august morning .			1

@entity139 : @entity54 made her final entry in her diary 70 years ago friday
days later , she and family arrested , sent to concentration camp , where she died
prose says @entity54 's diary a direct , *relatable* window to history for young people
she says teaching book keeps us alive to history , alert to forces of prejudice and hatred
