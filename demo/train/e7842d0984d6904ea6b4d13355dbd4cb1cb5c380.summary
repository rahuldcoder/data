@entity0 is something of a national icon			2
his face is on a @entity5 postage stamp			0
countless statues , murals , libraries , schools , parks and streets are named after him -- he even has his own national monument			0
he was on the cover of @entity14 in 1969			0
a naval ship was named after him			0
the man even has his own @entity18 and @entity19 ad			0
yet his footprint in @entity5 history is widely unknown and that 's exactly the reason why actor - turned - director @entity24 decided to produce a movie about his life			1
" i was really surprised that there was n't already a film out about @entity0 's life , so that 's why i spent the past four years making this and hope the country will join me in celebrating his life and work , " @entity24 said during tuesday 's screening of " @entity0 : an @entity36 " in @entity37			1
the movie opens nationwide on friday			0
after seeing farm workers harvesting the country 's food unable to afford feeding their own families -- let alone the deplorable working conditions they faced -- @entity0 decided to act			1
he and @entity44 co-founded what 's now known as the @entity46			2
they became the first to successfully organize farm workers while being completely committed to nonviolence			1
without @entity0 , @entity51 's farm workers would n't have fair wages , lunch breaks and access to toilets or clean water in the fields			1
not to mention public awareness about the dangers of pesticides to farm workers and helping outlaw the short - handled hoe			1
despite widespread knowledge of its dangers , this tool damaged farm workers ' backs			1
his civil rights activism has been compared to that of @entity72 and @entity73			0
difficult conditions in @entity5 's fields but as the film successfully highlights @entity0 's accomplishments , viewers will also be confronted with an uncomfortable truth about who picks their food and under what conditions			1
unfortunately , @entity0 's successes do n't cross state lines			1
states such as @entity37 , where farm workers face long hours without any overtime pay or a day of rest , are of concern for human rights activist @entity90 , president of the @entity91			1
the @entity92 have been supporters of the @entity46 since sen. @entity94 broke bread with @entity0 during the last day of his fast against violence in 1968			1
" @entity37 is 37 years behind @entity51			1
farm workers here can be fired if they tried collective bargaining , " @entity90 said after the " @entity0 " screening			1
" we need a @entity0			2
" opinion : why i did n't eat for 22 days @entity51 is still the only state where farm workers have the right to organize			1
@entity90 is urging the passing of the @entity107 , which would give farm workers the right to one day of rest each week , time - and - a - half pay for work past an eight - hour day , as well as unemployment , workers ' compensation and disability insurance			1
it 's not just @entity37			2
farm workers across the country face hardship			1
in @entity124 's blueberry fields , there 's a great deal of child labor , @entity121 said			0
" because they 're paid by piece - rate , it puts a lot of stress on all family members to chip in			0
plus , families work under one social security number because about 80 % of the farm worker population is undocumented , " @entity121 added			2
that 's why the @entity46 and major grower associations worked closely with the @entity139 's immigration reform bill to include special provisions that would give farm workers legal status if they continued to work in agriculture			1
" farm workers should n't struggle so much to feed their own families , and we can be part of that change , " @entity24 said			1
a national holiday in honor @entity0 ? to help facilitate that change , @entity24 and the film 's cast -- @entity154 as @entity0 , @entity155 as his wife , @entity156 , and @entity157 as labor leader @entity44 -- have been trekking all over the country promoting the film and a petition to make @entity0 's birthday on march 31 a national holiday			1
" we are n't pushing @entity164 just to give people a day off			0
it 's to give people a ' day on ' because we have a responsibility to provide service to our communities , " @entity46 president @entity121 told @entity166			2
in 2008 , president @entity170 showed his support for the national holiday and even borrowed the @entity46 famous chant " @entity174 ! ' -- coined by @entity44 -- during his first presidential campaign			2
@entity170 endorsed it again in 2012 , when he created a national monument to honor @entity0 , but the resolution still has to be passed by @entity179 to be recognized as a national holiday			2
right now , @entity164 is recognized only in @entity51 , @entity181 and @entity182			0
@entity44 , 83 , is still going strong in her activism and has also helped promote the film			0
she said she wishes the film could have included more history , but she knows it 's impossible			0
" there were so many important lessons in the film			0
all the sacrifices @entity0 and his wife , @entity156 , had to make and the obstacles we had to face against the police and judges			0
we even had people that were killed in the movement but we were still able to organize , " @entity44 said			0
actor @entity200 , who attending the @entity37 screening , knew the @entity202 and credited him with the launch of his acting career			2
@entity200 , known for his role as the father on @entity208 's " @entity209 " tv series , said his first acting gig was in the @entity46 's theatrical troupe educating and helping raising farm workers ' awareness about their work conditions			1
" i 've waited more than 35 years for this film to be made , and i ca n't tell you how honored i am to finally see it happen , " @entity200 told @entity166			2
@entity0 an inspiration to @entity170 campaign it 's not that there was n't interest in making the biopic before : @entity225 studios and directors have approached the @entity0 family in the past , but the family kept turning them down , mainly for two reasons			2
" well , first @entity0 did n't want to spend the time making the film because there was so much work to do , and he was hesitant on being singled out because there were so many others that contributed to the @entity46 's success , " said @entity121			1
it was n't until @entity24 came around and asked the @entity0 family how they felt the movie should be made that the green light was given			1
but when it came time to getting the funding to produce the film , @entity225 was not willing			0
" hopefully this film will send a message to @entity225 that our [ @entity249 ] stories need to be portrayed in cinema , " @entity24 added			2
" latinos go to the movies more than anyone else , but we 're the least represented on screen			0
it does n't make any sense , " @entity157 told @entity166			0
in 2012 , @entity249 represented 18 % of the movie - going population but accounted for 25 % of all movies seen , according to @entity261			0
" i hope young people use the power of social media to help spread the word about social change , " @entity157 said			0
" there is power in being a consumer and boycotting			0
if we want more as a community , we need to speak up			0

@entity0 's life not widely known , but actor - director @entity24 hopes to change that
@entity90 : " @entity37 is 37 years behind @entity51 . we need a @entity0 . "
film depicts @entity0 and @entity46 's success , but there is still more work to be done
@entity24 : " farm workers should n't struggle so much to feed their own families "
