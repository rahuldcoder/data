-- immigrants in @entity2 without a valid visa or green card could soon carry one form of state - issued documentation -- a driver 's license -- thanks to a law signed monday by the governor			1
the bill could affect about 250,000 drivers who traverse @entity2 ' roads without a license or other documentation that authorizes their presence in the @entity17			1
once it takes effect in 10 months , those who have been in @entity2 for over a year who are n't eligible for a social security number can get a driver 's license if they pass a driving safety test and have valid automobile insurance			1
although he referenced the divisive immigration debate in @entity28 , gov. @entity29 said the measure signed monday was mostly motivated by a desire to optimize safety along @entity2 roads			1
another aim is to reduce an estimated $ 64 million in annual damage claims related to accidents involving undocumented immigrants , thereby lowering insurance premiums paid by others @entity2 drivers			2
" @entity2 is moving forward , " the governor said			2
" this common sense law will help everybody , regardless of their background , learn the rules of the road , pass a driving test and get insurance			2
as a result , our roads will be safer , we will create more access to job opportunities , and our economic growth will be strengthened			0
" the statement issued by @entity29 's office touts the positive effect the new law will have on undocumented immigrants -- and , it argues , on the state 's economy as a whole			2
specifically , it cites studies that show immigrants " who drive legally are more likely to work , spend and contribute to the economy			0
" and those with driver 's licenses will have more job opportunities available to them , which the governor 's office says should generally boost businesses in the state			1
access to driver 's licenses is also important to immigrant rights groups , who see it as a sign of inclusiveness and perhaps a harbinger of broader immigration reform that will keep more families together			1
" today is a proud day for our immigrant community , " said @entity88 ceo @entity87			0
" the signing of today 's law sends a clear signal : our country is ready to unite in a bipartisan manner to pass a humane immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship			1
" state senate minority leader @entity99 , a @entity100 , said her state 's politicians should be proud of the effort , which she said was necessitated by " the inaction of the federal government			0
" another @entity100 , state house minority leader @entity106 , praised a law he said will allow more @entity2 residents to legally " go to work , take their kids to school or the doctor , " in addition to making " the roads safer for all residents			2
" opinion : stars align on immigration " today in @entity2 , we take a monumental step in recognizing the needs of many hard - working immigrants living here and contributing so much to our great state , " @entity106 said			1
but not all @entity100 nationwide support such an initiative			0
@entity129 gov. @entity128 said last week that she 'll push -- for the third time -- to repeal what she called a " dangerous law " that lets undocumented immigrants in her state get driver 's licenses			1
critics claim that the 2003 law has made @entity129 a magnet for fraud , with state secretary of taxation and @entity142 contending in 2011 that " illegal immigrants from all over the country come to @entity129 to obtain a license without having the intention of staying here			0
" the only other state to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver 's licenses is @entity28			1
@entity150 issues driving privilege cards to undocumented immigrants who live in the state for more than six months			0
monday 's announcement in @entity154 comes the same day a bipartisan group of eight @entity17 senators floated their framework for national immigration reform			1
president @entity159 -- whom some @entity160 had criticized for not making immigration a top priority in his first term , though they overwhelmingly backed him in the 2012 election -- will address the issue tuesday night			0
possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape among other elements , the senators ' proposal includes a " tough but fair " path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the @entity17 and a guest worker program for jobs that @entity17 are either unable or unwilling to fill			2
this plan drew swift condemnation from some conservative groups and politicians , reflecting the battle lines on the issue that have been drawn in earlier debates and suggesting that it wo n't be easy to get any such legislation through @entity186			0
@entity187 , a group seeking to reduce @entity17 immigration , called the senators ' plan an attempt to " out - amnesty @entity159 " and said it will urge its 1.3 million members to push to fight it			0
and rep. @entity194 , @entity195 , said the proposed measures may cost taxpayers millions of dollars as well as thousands of jobs			0
" by granting amnesty , the @entity200 proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration , " @entity194 said .			0
