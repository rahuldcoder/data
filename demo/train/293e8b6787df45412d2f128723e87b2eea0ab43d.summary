-- the wife of a former top @entity4 politician has admitted to poisoning a @entity6 businessman , blaming a " mental breakdown " for her actions that resulted in @entity10 's death , state news reported			1
the closely watched murder trial of @entity12 took place thursday , adjourning in the afternoon without the announcement of a verdict , said @entity16 , deputy head of the @entity17			1
on friday , the state - run @entity19 news agency offered details on what transpired in court the previous day during the seven - hour long trial			0
that included a statement by @entity12 in which she not only did n't deny the accusations levied against her , but " accepted all the facts written in the indictment " -- including poisoning @entity10 at a time when she thought her son 's life was in danger			1
who is @entity12 ? " during those days last november , i suffered a mental breakdown after learning my son was in jeopardy , " @entity12 , 53 , said shortly before the trial concluded			1
" the tragedy , which was created by me , was not only extended to @entity10 , but also to several families			0
" her family aide and alleged co-conspirator , @entity45 , likewise admitted to his part in the crime and said he wanted to say " sorry " to the victim 's family			1
" i hope the court can give me a chance to take a new lease on life , " @entity45 said in the court in the eastern city of @entity52 , according to the @entity19 report			0
" i really know that i did wrong			0
" the pair were accused of killing the 41 - year - old @entity10 last november in a hotel room in the city of @entity61			1
@entity4 authorities had previously said that @entity12 and her son had " conflicts " with @entity10 " over economic interests " and that she was motivated to kill the @entity66 because of fears for her son @entity68 's safety			1
reached friday by e-mail , @entity68 declined to comment on his mother 's confession or " any details pertaining to the case			0
" @entity12 's admission is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of @entity79 , @entity12 's husband , who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of @entity4 's ruling party			1
the family 's alleged involvement in @entity10 's death triggered the most sensational @entity4 political scandal in recent memory			2
and it created an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once - in - a - decade leadership transition later this year			0
why the @entity12 trial is important ? prosecutors said in court thursday that @entity12 had invited @entity10 to the southwestern @entity4 metropolis of @entity61 -- the city where @entity68 was then the @entity101 chief -- from @entity102			1
the trial took place 1,200 kilometers ( 750 miles ) east of @entity61 , where @entity10 died and where support for @entity68 and his family remains strong			1
@entity10 and @entity12 drank alcohol and tea in a hotel room , after which the @entity66 got drunk and began vomiting , a prosecutor said			1
when @entity10 asked for water , @entity12 asked @entity45 , who 'd been waiting outside , to come into the room			2
it was then that @entity12 got cyanide from @entity45 and , after her aide carried @entity10 to the bed , poured the poison into the @entity66 's mouth , according to the prosecutor			1
@entity12 then scattered capsules containing narcotics on the floor to make it seem like @entity10 was using drugs , the prosecution said			2
she put a " do not disturb " sign on @entity10 's hotel room door and told hotel staff not to bother him , a hotel employee said			1
neither @entity12 nor @entity45 objected to the prosecution 's outline of the case , according to @entity16 , the court official , though @entity12 's lawyer did argue for leniency			2
@entity68 and @entity12 on trial , in different ways in her statement , @entity12 explained how , in 2005 , she and her son @entity68 got to know @entity10 after he wrote them to introduce himself			2
the @entity66 later became an agent and participant in a land development project in @entity4 that never materialized			0
when @entity10 asked for compensation , he began to have disputes with the family and -- according to @entity12 -- threatened her son 's personal safety			1
prosecutors displayed numerous e-mails between @entity10 and @entity12 's son showing the increasingly heated conflict			1
at some point , @entity12 decided to kill @entity10 , prosecutors said			2
they displayed a statement by @entity12 in which she said , " to me , that was more than a threat			0
it was real action that was taking place			0
i must fight to my death to stop the craziness of @entity10			0
" in an e-mail to @entity0 tuesday , @entity68 said he had submitted a witness statement to his mother 's defense team			0
" i have faith that facts will speak for themselves , " wrote @entity68 , 24 , who graduated from @entity169 's @entity168 in may			0
a @entity68 family friend said the court did not accept the younger @entity68 's statement as evidence thursday			0
another facet of the case that 's drawn international attention , as noted in the @entity19 report , was the fact that an official appointed by @entity68 's family initially was among those who first decided not to categorize @entity10 's death as a criminal case			2
these authorities covered up @entity12 's presence at the scene by fabricating interview records and hiding evidence , among other measures , the report said			2
the authorities " persuaded " @entity10 's relatives to accept their conclusion and cremated the @entity6 citizen 's body without conducting an autopsy , according to @entity19			2
but the case was reopened after @entity198 , then vice mayor and police chief of @entity61 , tried to defect to the @entity201 consulate in the neighboring @entity203 city of @entity204			0
in a related case , @entity4 state media reported thursday that four top @entity61 policemen will be tried for trying to cover up @entity10 's murder to help @entity12			1
the four -- @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 -- were charged july 30 and will face trial in @entity52 , @entity19 and @entity214 reported			0
they have been charged with " acting with partiality and defeating the ends of justice , " the outlets reported			0
@entity0 's @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .			0
