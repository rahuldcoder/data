-- the ' queen ' of @entity3 's gambling empire is about to unveil a new palace			1
the foundations are already being laid for @entity3 's new multi-billion dollar casino - resort , named -- aptly enough -- @entity7			1
it will be the latest jewel in @entity11 business magnate @entity10 's glittering casino crown , after he originally built @entity13 's premier @entity14 , and @entity15 -- now owned by @entity16			1
and the person to launch it ? forty - seven year old executive director @entity19			2
often sighted as a likely successor to billionaire @entity10 , @entity21 - born chief operating officer @entity20 oversaw the opening of luxury gaming , hotel , and retail complex @entity3 , in 2006			1
and she 's not about to stop there			0
" when we first came to @entity3 , the scene was more about gaming , " @entity20 told @entity0 's @entity29			1
" and the aspiration for @entity3 , the reason we wanted to be here , is taking it to the next level			2
" in @entity13 , it 's no longer just about gaming			0
it 's about the entertainment			0
it 's where you would consider the best shows in the world , the best shopping , and the best restaurants			0
it 's about the whole experience , and that 's what we wanted to do here			0
" in its first year @entity3 quadrupled its annual revenue from $ 1 billion to $ 4.5billion , under @entity20 's @entity54 of @entity56 's 50 most powerful businesswomen , according to @entity57 , @entity20 has worked her socks off to become the second in command at @entity10			1
but could luck also have played a part in her success ? @entity20 apparently has the number 8888 -- considered lucky in @entity67 culture -- for her phone , a present from her wealthy boss			1
luck or no luck , gaming was not the direction @entity20 or her parents saw her career going , when she graduated from @entity80 's @entity79 in 1989			2
" it was the end of the world for them , " she says with a laugh			0
" for @entity67 parents coming from @entity21 , they never knew anybody else who worked in the casino industry			2
they never thought somebody would live outside the casinos in @entity13			0
so it took a while , but eventually they were supportive			0
" stepping out of her private jet , @entity20 appears every inch the high - flying business superstar			1
but when asked about one day succeeding @entity10 himself , she is a little reticent			2
" mr @entity10 's very young , he is not ready to retire soon , " @entity20 says with a smile			1
" i hope he works for another 30 , 40 years -- and i 'll be alongside with him			0
" inspire : first class style with @entity104 debate : can successful women have it all ?			0
