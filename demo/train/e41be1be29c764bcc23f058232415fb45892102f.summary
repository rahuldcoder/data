-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 went into hiding last week , canceling appearances and perhaps hoping that a blast of sharply negative press coverage -- triggered by a hard - hitting front - page @entity7 story -- will somehow fade away			1
that was wishful thinking : the bad press is n't going to vanish anytime soon			0
@entity1 faces a crater - sized pothole in the road between the governor 's office at the state capital in @entity18 and the much more important , oval - shaped one in @entity20 that he dreams of someday occupying			1
and he has nobody to blame but himself			0
the @entity7 published a trove of e-mails and interviews that show top @entity1 aides actively interfered with a high - level anti-corruption investigative panel -- in ways that benefited big - money donors to @entity1 -- even after @entity1 personally and repeatedly vowed the commission would be independent			1
when the anti-corruption commission issued a subpoena to a firm that prints and promotes campaign items , the governor 's top aide , @entity34 , ordered the commission to drop the inquiry			2
" pull it back , " @entity34 told commission staff , according to the @entity7			2
other supporters of @entity1 got similar protected treatment -- and @entity1 ended up abruptly disbanding the panel before its work was completed or a final report issued			1
after five days of silence , @entity1 announced -- at 11 p.m. on a sunday -- that he would take questions monday in @entity46 , far from the @entity48 media capital			2
in the course of answering reporters , @entity1 changed his story once again , claiming the commission had " total independence , " a direct about - face from his office 's detailed 13 - page claim that the investigation was always under full control of the governor 's office			1
that might seem like an obscure local matter , but @entity2 -- including @entity48 , the media capital -- has been through a decade of nearly constant official corruption that shows no signs of slowing			0
in the last 10 years , more than 30 state officials have been indicted , convicted , censured or otherwise accused of financial or personal improprieties			0
one former governor , @entity68 , made national headlines by resigning after acknowledging hiring prostitutes , and his successor , @entity71 , was hit with a $ 62,000 fine for taking free tickets to a baseball game and lying about it			0
an ex-state comptroller , @entity75 , recently completed 20 months in prison for taking $ 1 million in gifts from a financial operator seeking business from the state 's pension fund			0
and a depressing parade of state legislators have marched into prison year after year : they are a @entity86 of chicanery : republicans , @entity89 , @entity93 , @entity91 , @entity92 , black , @entity90 and @entity94			0
one miscreant , former assemblyman @entity96 ( serving a 10 - year sentence ) stole from a local @entity99 team , among other organizations			0
another thief , former assemblyman @entity101 , got a dose of rough justice when he died inside the walls of a federal prison a few months into a six - year sentence for fraud			0
before trying his hand at politics @entity108 had worked as a prison guard			0
those highlights barely scratch the surface of a corruption problem that @entity48 have stoically come to accept as the new normal			0
a recent poll finds that an astounding two - thirds of @entity48 believe that state politicians " do what 's best for them and their political friends and it never surprises me when another one gets indicted			0
" but @entity1 was supposed to be a cure for the culture of corruption ; he ran for governor with a vow to clean up @entity18			1
and after years of failing to persaude the legislature to implement anti-corruption measures like meaningful contribution limits and a requirement to have legislators disclose all sources of outside income , @entity1 took the major step of creating a 25 - member blue - ribbon panel to root out wrongdoing , called the @entity139 , that was led by two district attorneys			1
@entity1 repeatedly promised the commission would be independent , and that it could investigate anyone -- including the governor himself -- in service to the goal of uncovering and rooting out official corruption			2
but @entity1 broke his promise : as the @entity7 story details , @entity1 's aides frequently blocked action by the commission in a way that spared the governor 's allies and donors any public embarrassment			1
and despite a preliminary report indicating deep - seated problems in detecting or stopping corruption , @entity1 dissolved the panel after nine months without so much as thanking members for their service or requesting a final report			1
the panel had served its purpose , said @entity1 , by pressuring the legislature to pass a watered - down version of ethics reform that good - government groups ridiculed as ineffective			1
in response to the @entity7 story , @entity1 's aides prepared a 13 - page masterpiece of doubletalk and hokum , arguing that the @entity139 could be disbanded at any time at the whim of the governor			1
that might be true in a narrow legal sense , but the governor is now being excoriated for falsely telling the public he had formed an independent panel			0
4 reasons @entity180 keeps moving forward " the governor is a liar and almost anything he promises will turn out to be false , " is how longtime columnist @entity181 of the @entity182 bluntly put it			2
the @entity7 was only slightly less direct , noting that " it is up to the voters to decide whether to go on endorsing business as usual			2
... @entity48 will have to decide if their representatives are politicians they can trust , including mr. @entity1			0
" the worst skewering might have come from @entity194 of " @entity195 " on the @entity197 channel , who ridiculed @entity1 mercilessly and dismissed the governor 's tortured explanation for dissolving the @entity139 as " effing ridiculous			2
" a much less funny critique has been launched by @entity203 attorney @entity202 , who has vowed to pick up where @entity1 's commission left off and continue searching for corruption in @entity18			1
along the way , @entity202 is expected to investigate whether meddling by @entity1 's staff broke any laws			1
no wonder @entity1 's been ducking the press			1
but he ca n't keep it up forever			0
people have a right to know when powerful officials switch their tune in an election year			0
that goes double for early states in the presidential race , like @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223			0
it may be too early to speculate about whether @entity1 intends to run for president , but it 's safe to say that deep - sixing an anti-corruption panel looks like politics as usual , exactly what voters are telling pollsters they wo n't tolerate			1
@entity1 should take a page from his neighbor , @entity180 gov. @entity180 of @entity233 , who has been far more adept at handling the more serious " @entity241 " scandal , in which thousands of commuters were subjected to paralyzing traffic jams for days on end , for what appears to be the pettiest of political reasons			1
unlike @entity1 's duck - and - cover strategy , @entity180 summarily sacked several close advisers , held a marathon news conference at which he answered dozens of questions , and hired a law firm to investigate his own conduct ( an inquiry that , not surprisingly , cleared @entity180 )			1
the @entity233 governor is n't out of the woods by any means , but he continues to be a sought - after speaker on the @entity254 circuit and is still considered a contender for the 2016 presidential nomination			0
that 's more than anybody can say for @entity1 these days .			2

the @entity7 found n.y. gov. @entity1 's aides interfered with anti-corruption panel
@entity264 : @entity1 ran on anti-corruption *platform* , but created this scandal himself
louis : he has been ducking the press , but he will have to address this head on
louis : @entity233 's @entity180 handled his @entity241 scandal with press conference , firings , probe
