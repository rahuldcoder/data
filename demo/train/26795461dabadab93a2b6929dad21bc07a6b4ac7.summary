@entity1 , @entity0 -- in these cash - strapped times , you might well wonder why governments around the world continue to pour millions of dollars in to their respective space programs			0
space exploration has produced a host of medical benefits including the ingestible thermometer pill			1
but one of the very important by - products of space exploration has been the adaptation and invention of medical equipment and technologies which are making individual lives better and in many cases saving them			2
most people are familiar with temper foam -- perhaps the most famous of @entity24 's many medical spinoffs -- which started life protecting astronauts ' posteriors in the 1960s and is now used in a host of products from mattresses to athletic shoes			0
it is surprising to note how many aspects of space exploration have played a part in helping scientists improve the health of nations			0
who would have thought that analysing fluid flow around a @entity43 engine would help create a tiny heart pump ? or that a water purification device for astronauts could help patients suffering from kidney disease			2
and that the humble hospital thermometer would be transformed by measuring infrared radiation in the stars and planets ?			1

space exploration has *provided* us with *numerous* medical benefits
@entity43 engines have *influenced* an *ingenious* heart pump
measuring infrared radiation of the planets has *revolutionized* the thermometer
@entity24 put the first men on the moon *40* years *ago* on *july* *20* , 1969
