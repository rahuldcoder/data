-- an @entity2 - produced video posted on a website in early july opens with uplifting images of smiling @entity6 children and jovial old men listening to speeches delivered by @entity2 militants			1
the video seems startlingly out of place on a website usually devoted to serious young men learning to fire machine guns , bloodshed and graphic images of civilian casualties purportedly caused by @entity19 forces in @entity20 and @entity21			0
instead , the video , featured on a site aligned with @entity2 , shows a @entity25 member of @entity2 's affiliate in @entity6 insisting that his group 's poor image is just a myth propagated by @entity31 media			2
he says : " the international channels try to twist the picture and portray the mujahedeen as bloodthirsty , as distanced from the people -- that they reject the people and do n't love them			0
" as the @entity25 militant speaks , young @entity6 boys crowd around him			0
@entity2 - affiliated fighters have set up " @entity45 " in @entity6 's largest city , @entity41 , where the jihadists can " educate the people on our point of view			1
" in another apparent attempt to soften its image , @entity2 members in @entity6 held something akin to a town fair			2
another @entity2 video produced in @entity6 surfaced online in july , this one showing an @entity2 - organized ice cream - eating contest in @entity41			1
around the same time , an @entity54 news outlet , @entity55 , published a video of a tug - of - war between members of the two @entity2 - affiliated rebel groups fighting in @entity6			1
in the video , crowds of young boys and older men cheer on the members of @entity2			0
@entity2 and its regional franchises understand they need to try to win the " heart and minds " of the local population ; something they have generally failed to do in the past and something that the leaders of these groups have come to understand is a major problem			1
in documents recovered in @entity79 's compound in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity79 and his top advisers privately criticized the brutal tactics of @entity2 in @entity20 , which had provoked a tribal uprising known as " the @entity85 " that almost destroyed @entity2 's @entity20 affiliate in 2006 and 2007			2
now , @entity2 in @entity20 and in neighboring @entity6 are experiencing a revival , a revival at least somewhat fueled by @entity2 learning from some of the mistakes it made during the previous decade in @entity20			1
this is significant because @entity2 's @entity6 affiliate , @entity91 , is widely considered to be the most effective rebel force fighting the @entity94 regime , and the group pledged allegiance to the leader of @entity2 , @entity98 , in april			2
but videos of @entity2 militants playing tug - of - war or joking with members of the local community are hardly signs of moderation			2
@entity2 's @entity6 branch releases lengthy and passionate sermons dedicated to denouncing @entity108 as apostates who should be killed			0
and although some @entity2 fighters in @entity6 might be engaging the public with ice cream , games and conversation , their colleagues in neighboring @entity20 continue to launch bloody attacks on civilians			1
on monday , at least 50 people were killed in 15 separate car bomb attacks in @entity120			0
many of those bombings are believed be the work of @entity2 's @entity20 affiliate			0
in all likelihood , @entity2 and its allied groups are doing too little , too late , in their quest to win the public 's hearts and minds			1
the group 's senior leaders recognized the dangers of killing too many @entity135 civilians as far back as 2005 , when @entity98 reprimanded the founder of @entity2 in @entity20 , @entity136 , for alienating the @entity20 people with indiscriminate violence			1
and the majority of @entity108 around the world reject violence in the name of @entity143 , particularly in the form of suicide bombings			0
this is unsurprising , given that @entity2 's violence has primarily claimed @entity135 lives			0
it will take a lot more than ice cream socials to undo that damage .			0

**writers** : @entity2 posting feel - good videos , holding ice cream eating contests , tugs of war
they say @entity2 and affiliates want to win " hearts and minds , " but the groups have failed
**writers** : @entity2 fighters in @entity6 try sugar and spice tack , but in @entity20 they kill civilians
new image will not win over people *appalled* by *murder* in the name of @entity143 , they say
