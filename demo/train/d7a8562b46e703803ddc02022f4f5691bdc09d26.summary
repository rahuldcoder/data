in little over a week , @entity0 has announced three new developments in its quest to produce sustainable aviation biofuel			1
last week , the company identified " green diesel " as a new biofuel that would emit at least 50 % less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel over its lifecycle			1
on saturday , a new initiative to build a biofuel supply chain in the @entity12 was unveiled using another type of fuel			2
it was celebrated with a 45 - minute demonstration flight by an @entity18 777 plane powered by @entity12 - produced biofuel			0
on wednesday , also out of @entity20 , @entity0 and partners said they had made breakthroughs in researching a shrub - like plant called halophytes , which feeds off seawater in desert terrain			0
the research on the shrub - like plant was spearheaded by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , which is funded by @entity0 , @entity18 and @entity31 and hosted by the @entity32 in @entity20			0
according to the findings , the desert plant can be made into biofuel more effectively than many other feedstocks			0
" @entity39 show even more promise than we expected as a source of renewable fuel for jets and other vehicles , " said @entity30 director dr. @entity37 in a statement			0
diversification why so many types of biofuel ? for aviation companies , it 's important to diversify the types of crops for biofuel production , as well as the locations where the crops are grown			0
this reduces exposure to the fuel cost volatility that comes from relying on a single source of energy			0
similar to the supply chain announced by @entity0 , @entity61 has established six regional alternative fuel " value chains " in @entity68 , @entity69 , the @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , and is looking at feedstocks such as algae and cooking oil			2
the industry 's pressures and incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are enormous			2
the current aggressive target is carbon neutral growth from 2020 and a 50 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 , based on 2005 levels , according to both manufacturers and the @entity84 ( @entity84 )			1
according to @entity84 , air transport produced 689 million tons of carbon dioxide , approximately 2 % of the global total , in 2012			1
@entity89 diesel " our industry still faces two issues : there is n't enough aviation biofuel to meet airline demand , and we need to bring the cost down to parity with petroleum jet fuel , " says @entity90 of @entity0 's environment communications team			1
for @entity0 , green diesel is one of most compelling of the many biofuel " pathways " -- but not because it 's considered to be better than other sources in terms of carbon emissions			1
instead , green diesel 's distinguishing factor is that it 's already made in bulk , with a global production capacity of 800 million gallons			1
while that 's far from meeting the total global aviation jet fuel demand of 60 billion gallons per year , the capacity to quickly address 1 % of it ( 600 million gallons ) is worth chasing			1
@entity0 is currently seeking approval from regulators around the world to use it as jet fuel , blended with petroleum , beginning this year			2
despite being made from the same sources of vegetable oils and animal fats , green diesel is not to be confused with biodiesel , as the latter produces different types of molecules during processing and can not be used as jet fuel			1
@entity131 is another big reason this new biofuel is a frontrunner -- with government incentives , it costs approximately $ 3 a gallon -- a competitive alternative to fossil jet fuel			2
since aviation biofuel was approved for use in 2011 , more than 1,500 commercial flights have been powered by a blend of traditional fuel and biofuels			1
fueling the race as companies pour resources into developing alternative fuels , it makes sense for major oil - producing nations to have a stake in what will potentially become their biggest competitor			0
@entity0 's joint initiative with partners in the @entity12 , including the government - owned @entity18 , thus marks a number of firsts			0
it 's the first time @entity12 has refined biofuel ( by a subsidiary of the @entity163 ) , as well as the first flight fueled with a new processing technology that is not yet approved but will be used in @entity12 biofuel production in the future			0
critics and challenges while aviation companies such as @entity0 and @entity61 pour money and manpower into researching aviation biofuels , there are still critics that say it 's not worth the effort , and in fact may be causing more harm			2
last year , the @entity178 reported that the expansion of the biofuels industry is causing a shortage of land for food crops in the poor regions of @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			0
the @entity188 proposed amending a policy on biofuels last year , due to concerns that first - generation biofuel production is pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it saves through use as fuel , but a compromise to restrict @entity199 subsidies for first - generation biofuel was rejected in december			1
the issue is expected to remain at a standstill until the new parliament takes office later this year			0
" @entity0 's position , and that of many airlines we work with , is that aviation biofuel must be produced sustainably , meeting criteria for environmental , economic and social benefit , " said @entity90			1
" we do not pursue development of biofuel using feedstocks that compete for resources ( such as land or water ) used for food production			0

@entity0 announces three new aviation biofuel initiatives
the @entity222 airline maker says " green diesel " would emit 50 % less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel over its lifecycle
in 2012 , air transport produced 689 million tons of carbon dioxide -- 2 % of the global total
