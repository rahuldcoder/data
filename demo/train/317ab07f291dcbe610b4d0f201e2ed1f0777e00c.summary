-- the first wave of @entity3 's 814 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the remote northeastern states of @entity6 and @entity7 monday , as the largest election in world history got underway			1
any time the world 's most populous democracy goes to the polls , it 's a momentous undertaking			2
but with prime minister @entity15 stepping aside after a decade in charge , analysts say voting will take on an even greater significance this time around , with the country potentially poised on the cusp of a new political era			2
amid widespread public concern over corruption , rising inflation and slowing economic growth , voters face a choice between the young scion of @entity3 's most powerful political dynasty , and a populist , business - minded @entity32 nationalist who is described as at once @entity3 's most popular and most divisive politician			1
" this election is a battle of ideologies , it 's a battle for ( the ) kind of @entity3 we want , " declared 43 - year - old @entity36 candidate @entity35 -- whose great - grandfather , grandmother and father have all served as prime minister -- in a recent speech			1
the outcome of the election , which will be held in stages over five weeks -- employing 11 million polling and security personnel and absorbing an estimated $ 5 billion in campaigning costs -- may have stark ramifications for @entity3 's identity at home and abroad			1
by the @entity58 : the world 's biggest exercise in democracy @entity62 rides high after a decade of coalition government led by the secular , center - left @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , which has ruled for most of the post-independence era , support is soaring for @entity3 's other major political party			1
polling suggests a strong swing to the center - right , @entity32 - nationalist @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , with a recent survey by the @entity74 finding voters preferred the @entity72 to lead the next government by a margin of more than three to one			1
the party 's support has been boosted by the immense popularity of prime ministerial candidate @entity62 , 63 - year - old chief minister of the western state of @entity82			2
nearly 80 % of those surveyed by @entity74 had a positive view of @entity62 , with 60 % describing their impressions of him as very favorable			2
( by comparison , 50 % held positive views of @entity35 , with just 23 % giving " very favorable " responses			0
) watch : @entity3 heads to the polls @entity62 's reputation as a tough , " can - do " administrator rests largely on his record in charge of @entity82 since 2001 , a state whose economic success is often cited as an example for the rest of the country			1
the @entity72 's economic model under @entity62 , focusing on infrastructure , urbanization and eradicating red tape , contrasts sharply with the traditional approach of the @entity36 , whose focus on promoting inclusive growth involves a raft of welfare schemes			2
@entity110 , director of the @entity111 at the @entity112 , said @entity62 's model was widely seen as offering better prospects of economic development , particularly by the young voters tipped to play a key role in the election			1
about 100 million voters will be eligible to vote for the first time in 2014			1
" they 're getting some hope that perhaps @entity62 can steer the economy in the right direction so that they can get more in terms of job opportunities and economic growth , " he said			0
" these young voters are exposed through electronic media to the whole world , and have a dream of moving forward -- not lagging behind as their fathers and grandfathers have for decades			1
" @entity136 , a political analyst at @entity139 's @entity138 , likens @entity62 's economic vision for a " right - wing , authoritarian corporate state " as closer to the model in @entity143 -- @entity3 's neighboring superpower whose rapid economic ascent is eyed enviously from the subcontinent , where gdp growth has dropped below 5 %			1
a @entity32 nationalist at the helm ? in contrast to the @entity36 's secularism , @entity62 is also notable as a @entity32 nationalist -- a position that resonates with large swathes of an increasingly confident , assertive electorate , but gives pause to some among the country 's religious minorities			1
" internationally , he would be a little more hardline on everything -- @entity162 , @entity143 , @entity163			1
@entity3 interests would be aggressively asserted , " said @entity136			1
" it plays well with the electorate , the new generation coming up that 's educated by the @entity167 -- they tend to be right - wing nerds			1
" their nationalist perspective , he said , was informed by " a sense of victimhood , that we 've been victimized by foreigners -- by @entity178 invaders , @entity179 invaders			1
" but for all the excitement around @entity62 , he comes with plenty of detractors			0
chief among them are those who question his suitability to lead a country as diverse as @entity3			1
in particular , his track record with @entity3 's 180 million - strong @entity178 community , the country 's second largest religious group , has come under scrutiny			1
less than a year after @entity62 assumed office in @entity82 in late 2001 , the state was wracked with @entity196 violence , in which more than 1000 people , mostly @entity178 , were killed			0
@entity62 was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence , accusations he has denied			0
the @entity199 denied @entity62 a visa in 2005 over the issue , but last month said it would welcome @entity62 to the @entity163 if he wins			1

" there is no ' @entity82 model , ' and there are other states with faster economic growth , " says @entity136			0
many feel that economic development in the state has been unequally distributed , and not matched with corresponding gains in human development , he said			0
@entity62 's style of leadership -- perceived as decisive by admirers , as autocratic by detractors -- is also seen by some as ill - suited for the nation 's top office			2
" it 's not a place where you can press buttons -- you have to work with people , " said @entity136 , who knows @entity62 personally			2
" the prime minister of india has to be the supreme conciliator , reconciling the aspirations and demands of thousands of groups			0
it 's not like @entity143 where you can turn off @entity238 one day -- you ca n't be autocratic or they 'll cut you out			2
" @entity35 : a prime minister - in - waiting ? yet any misgivings about @entity62 have so far failed to buoy the prospects of the @entity36 candidate @entity35			0
with an unparalleled political pedigree as the son of assassinated former prime minister @entity247 and the @entity249 - born @entity36 president @entity248 , the 43 - year - old has long been viewed as a prime minister - in - waiting			0
but his chances have been hampered by widespread voter displeasure with the @entity36 - led coalition government over high inflation , slowing economic growth and a run of corruption scandals , says @entity110			0
for all @entity35 's youth , his party is seen as the old order , with @entity62 widely viewed as providing the alternative to the status quo , says @entity136			2
" i do n't think @entity35 is in the game , " he said			0
" he 's seen as undeserving , his mother 's son			2
how many generations can you pull along like this ? i think people are getting tired of it , " he said			0
in contrast to what @entity136 described as @entity62 's " relentless drive to become prime minister , " questions have been asked whether @entity35 possesses a genuine desire to lead , while his personal style has failed to excite voters			0
" like somebody said , he 's got the charisma of cold pizza , " said @entity136			0
anti-corruption platform while both parties pledge to target corruption , said @entity136 , a lack of public confidence in either to effectively address the problem has paved the way for a new political force to enter the fray			0
formed in late 2012 , the @entity293 ( @entity292 , led by former delhi chief minister @entity294 , won an unexpected 28 of 70 seats in the @entity296 in 2013			0
contesting its first general election , it will be fielding more candidates than either major party			1
@entity136 said the anti-corruption party could prove to have some longevity			0
" they 're going to flag the agenda , they 're making their presence felt this time around , " said @entity136			0
" by the time the next election comes around , they 'll be a big force			0
" @entity110 said a long - term commitment would be required to make any progress in tackling @entity3 's entrenched , endemic corruption problem			1
" i wish ( @entity294 ) will be able to succeed -- but it wo n't be overnight , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
