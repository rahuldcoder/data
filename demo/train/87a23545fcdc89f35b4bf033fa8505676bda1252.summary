-- @entity1 , whose long acting career included performances in " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 : @entity8 , " has died			1
a family member confirmed his death to @entity0			2
@entity1 was long one of @entity13 's favorite character actors , giving his parts -- often villains , mobsters or shopkeepers -- an added touch of menace with his gravelly voice			1
in " @entity4 " and " @entity5 " -- two key ' 60s @entity21 -- he played bandits			1
he also played opposite some of the biggest stars in history			2
his more than 150 credits includes roles in " @entity28 " ( 1961 ) , with @entity29 and @entity30 ; " @entity35 " ( 1965 ) , with @entity36 and @entity37 ; " @entity38 " ( 1986 ) , with @entity39 and @entity40 ; " the @entity41 " ( 1990 ) , with @entity42 ; and even a small , uncredited role in " @entity44 " ( 2003 ) , starring @entity31 and @entity32 and directed by @entity33 -- his co-star in " @entity5			1
" but @entity1 's heart was in live theater , where he originated parts in such works as @entity50 ' " the @entity49 " and @entity52 's " rhinoceros			1
" " for actors , movies are a means to an end , " @entity1 told the @entity53 in 1973			1
" i go and get on a horse in @entity58 for 10 weeks , and i have enough cushion to come back and do a play			2
" @entity1 was born in @entity61 , @entity62 , on december 7 , 1915			1
though he was @entity63 , he grew up in a largely @entity65 neighborhood , an experience that would later help him in a number of roles			2
" i grew up watching @entity69			2
and , in ' @entity5 , ' ( director ) @entity70 said , ' you have to pray in here			1
you know how to cross yourself ? ' i said , ' well , i 'm @entity63 , but i learned how to cross myself because the @entity69 did it every day 30 , 40 times a day , crossing themselves , ' " he said in an interview with the blog @entity76			2
@entity1 attended the @entity80 -- among his classmates was @entity82 -- and served in the @entity83 during @entity84 after the war , he attended the @entity86 and became a leading devotee of the method , the approach to acting that asks performers to draw on their own experiences and emotions for an interior understanding of the part			1
( @entity96 , perhaps the method 's primary @entity98 popularizer , once said , " method acting is what all actors have always done whenever they acted well			0
" ) he won a @entity103 for his performance in " the @entity49 " and also acted in " @entity105 , " " @entity106 " and " @entity107			0
" he made his film debut in another @entity50 work , " @entity110 " ( 1956 ) , three years after turning down the role of @entity112 in " @entity113 " ( 1953 )			0
that part went to @entity115 and revitalized his career			0
" every time @entity115 met me after that , he would say to me , ' hello , you crazy actor , ' " he told @entity117			2
he almost turned down the part in " @entity4 , " but changed his mind when he saw how he could shape the role of the bandit @entity125 , he told the website @entity126			1
" i went to ( director @entity127 and said , ' in movie westerns , you never see what the bandits do with the money			0
... i want to show how they spend it			0
i want to have silk shirts			0
i 'm going to put in two gold teeth			0
i want a good horse , a wonderful saddle			0
' @entity127 said , ' ok			0
' " " @entity4 " also starred @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 and featured @entity145 's stirring score			1
of the leading members of the cast , only @entity146 is still alive			0
@entity1 worked steadily , whether on stage , the big screen or small -- especially if the tv series was based in @entity62			1
he was in a 1992 episode of " @entity153 " and performed in the short - lived " @entity154 " and " @entity155			2
" but work was work , and that also meant parts in " @entity159 , " " @entity160 , " " @entity161 " and the tv movie " @entity163			0
" he made " @entity7 : @entity8 " ( 2010 ) when he was 94			0
he had a sense of humor about his fame			0
he titled his memoir " @entity168 , the @entity169 and me , " since his role in " @entity5 " was " the @entity5 " -- @entity5 , the sometimes buffoonish bandit			1
and he enjoyed the spotlight -- even when he was promoting his book			0
" i 'm having fun answering questions , " he said in a publisher 's interview			0
" a woman asked me , ' is that your real name ? ' and i said , ' how do you dream up a name like mine ? ' " @entity1 is survived by his wife , actress @entity182 , to whom he was married for 66 years ; three children and many grandchildren			1
