-- it is possible , even likely , that the most important decision either president @entity3 or a president @entity4 would make in the next four years is whether to bomb @entity5 and its nuclear facilities			1
the debates were never likely to tell us much that would be useful about how either man would make that decision			0
no amount of stage presence or posturing can reveal the deepest recesses of the presidential mind -- the place where , especially in the age of mass destruction , decisions about going to war must be made			0
of course , @entity3 or @entity4 will not be the first president to ponder a pre-emptive strike against a rising nuclear power			1
in late summer 1953 , shortly after @entity26 became president , the @entity27 detonated their own crude h - bomb , code named @entity31 ( after @entity32 ) by the @entity33			1
about nine months earlier , the @entity33 had set off its own first h - bomb , code named @entity36 -- 500 times more powerful than the bombs that devastated @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40			0
" i 've never seen the president so concerned , " the president 's national security adviser , @entity41 , told the chief @entity44 speech writer , @entity43 , in early september			1
@entity41 quoted @entity26 as muttering , " my @entity46 , 10 of these things and ... " the president did n't finish the sentence			1
the @entity33 still had the capacity to knock out the @entity27 with a massive first strike			1
but for how long ? at a secret national security meeting on september 24 , 1953 , the president gathered his closest advisers and asked : would it be morally wrong not to attack the @entity27 before it was too late ? " the question could no longer be excluded , " a note taker wrote , " and it was the duty of the president and his advisers to find the best answer to it			1
" but while anyone could ask the question , in the end only the president could answer it			0
opinion : @entity3 's foreign policy on trial @entity26 and his advisers ultimately decided not to strike first , disregarding the wishes of some -- such as the @entity74 's gen. @entity73 -- who continued for many years to hope that @entity26 would unleash @entity33 's nuclear forces in a pre-emptive attack			1
certainly , @entity26 made very clear throughout the rest of his presidency that he was willing to use nuclear weapons to stop communist aggression , remaining purposefully vague about when or under what circumstances			1
such haziness was entirely intentional			0
as a @entity85 cadet and as a young army officer , @entity26 had been a great poker player			1
indeed , he had to quit the game because he risked hurting his career by taking money from too many fellow officers			0
( he switched to bridge , at which he was also expert			0
) always a good bluffer , as president he did the same with nuclear weapons			1
he used the threat of their use to get @entity33 out of @entity100 in 1953 , and similarly threatened during crises in @entity102 in 1954 , with @entity103 in the @entity104 in 1954 - 55 and again in 1958 , during the @entity106 crisis in 1956 and in @entity107 in 1958 - 59			0
@entity108 : @entity4 endorses @entity3 's national security policies would he have actually used these weapons if push came to shove ? he never told anyone -- not his wife or son or closest advisers			0
to do so , in a city with no permanent secrets , would make his threats less credible			0
@entity26 knew how to hold his cards , even if doing so hurt him politically			2
in 1958 , when he was under tremendous pressure to build more missiles to catch up the @entity121 , which had just launched the first satellite , @entity123 , and seemed to be creating what the press and some @entity125 were calling " the missile gap , " @entity26 seemed strangely passive			2
he knew that the @entity129 's spy plane , the u- 2 , had not found any @entity27 icbms , but he wanted to keep the existence of the spy plane a secret			1
the president 's bland public statements disappointed even his followers and gave rise to mutterings that he was too old ( 68 ) and playing too much golf ( about 100 times a year )			2
in the winter of 1958 , @entity26 was visited by the poet , @entity143 , who gave him a book of his poems inscribed with the notation , " the strong are saying nothing until they see			2
" @entity26 wrote a friend that @entity143 's words were his " favorite maxim			1
" @entity26 was accustomed to carrying great responsibility			2
in his breast pocket on d - day , he carried a note he had written in case the landings failed			0
" the responsibility is mine alone , " it read			0
on his first day as president in 1953 , @entity26 wrote in his diary , " plenty of worries and difficult problems			1
but such has been my portion for a long time			0
" neither @entity3 nor @entity4 have @entity26 's experience or credentials			1
but you can see just by looking at @entity3 's face that he has been forced to learn on the job			0
he or @entity4 will face greater tests			0
both men have said that containment is not an option when it comes to @entity5 getting the bomb			2
will either man strike first ? wait for @entity178 to strike first ? get ready to join a wider @entity180 war ? the strong are saying nothing until they see			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185			2

@entity185 : biggest decision for next president could be on bombing @entity5 's nuclear facilities
he says @entity26 pondered a pre-emptive strike against a rising nuclear power : the @entity27
he was pressed by some to strike but *grasped* the *magnitude* and decided not to do it
@entity185 : @entity26 was good bluffer ; faced with similar decision , will our next president fare as well ?
