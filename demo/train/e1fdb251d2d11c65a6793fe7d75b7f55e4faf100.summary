@entity0 -- during his two weeks aboard a ship to the @entity4 , @entity2 was questioned by @entity6 interrogators over his alleged role in the 2012 @entity9 attacks that left four @entity4 dead			1
as it turns out , he was interrogated both before and after authorities told him of his @entity14 rights -- which give him the right to remain silent to avoid self - incrimination , a @entity4 official told @entity1			1
but @entity2 continued providing information to officials after being advised of those rights , the official said			1
the handling of his case has triggered fallout in @entity0			0
" i have serious concerns that conducting a rushed interrogation onboard a ship and then turning @entity2 over to our civilian courts risks losing critical intelligence that could lead us to other terrorists or prevent future attacks , " sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , said in a statement saturday			1
a @entity4 official told @entity1 that @entity2 denied participation in the @entity9 attacks during his interviews with interrogators -- but provided information on others he said participated and were behind the attacks			1
it was n't clear if he provided the information before or after he was advised of his @entity14 warning			1
shortly after the @entity49 announced the capture earlier this month , republicans like @entity48 sen. @entity47 criticized the @entity52 administration because they believed the alleged terrorist should go through a military tribunal at @entity55 instead of being tried in a federal court			0
" if they bring him to the @entity4 , they 're going to mirandize this guy , and it would be a mistake for the ages to read this guy his @entity14 rights , " @entity58 sen. @entity57 has said			1
but the @entity49 has defended its decision , saying that they have successfully tried a number of terrorists domestically and that no new captives have gone to the @entity55 detention facility in years			0
@entity2 arrived on @entity4 soil saturday			1
after two weeks aboard the @entity72 sailing from the @entity73 to the @entity74 , @entity2 was flown by helicopter to @entity0 and was driven to a federal courthouse			2
there , he pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists			0
prosecutors say he is the ringleader of the 2012 attacks on a @entity4 diplomatic mission in @entity84 , which killed @entity4 ambassador to @entity84 @entity86 and three other @entity4			1
more charges possible the single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors , who plan to file additional charges later , according to @entity4 officials			0
the aim is to delay releasing to the public and @entity2 's lawyer the @entity6 affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him			2
an earlier criminal complaint in july 2013 said the @entity6 believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the @entity9 attacks			1
those additional charges , if formally added , could bring the death penalty			0
in his court appearance , @entity2 , a @entity84 national , requested consular assistance from the @entity84 government			1
@entity4 authorities were working with @entity84 embassy officials in @entity0 to provide him the assistance			2
after the hearing , armed guards accompanied @entity2 from the federal courthouse in downtown @entity0 , a few blocks from the @entity117 and near the @entity49			2
he was then moved to the detention center in @entity119 , @entity120 , which is across the @entity121 from the capital			0
details of the attacks authorities say @entity2 is among the senior leaders of @entity127 , whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on @entity4 government facilities in @entity9 on september 11 - 12 , 2012			1
the attacks spawned political controversy in the @entity4 because some @entity135 lawmakers claim the @entity52 administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them			0
the @entity135 critics say they plan to make @entity9 an issue for former secretary of state @entity140 , under whose watch the attacks occurred , should she decide to run for president			1
the criminal investigation led by the @entity6 has been extraordinarily challenging , authorities say , partly because the lack of @entity84 government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks			2
but @entity4 officials say they collected surveillance video , phone recordings and witness statements to bring charges against @entity2 and others involved			2
@entity2 became the face of the militant attack and a top target for the @entity4 after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks , meeting with journalists and granting interviews			1
he denied to @entity1 's @entity164 that he participated in the attacks			2
@entity4 military commandos captured @entity2 in a nighttime raid june 15 - 16			0
@entity4 intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the @entity4 surprised him			0
the commandos , accompanied by several @entity6 agents , had come ashore by boat and quickly took him back out to sea with them			0
