-- @entity2 activists and other conservatives are planning rallies next month in support of @entity7 's tough new immigration law , which has come under attack from @entity9 , latino groups and some maverick @entity11			1
but a growing chorus of conservative evangelical leaders has broken with their traditional political allies on the right			1
they 're calling the @entity7 law misguided and are attempting to use its passage to push for federal immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants			1
the group , which includes influential political activists such as @entity26 , head of the @entity29 's public policy wing , and @entity30 , dean of the @entity31 , will soon begin lobbying @entity11 leaders in @entity33 to support comprehensive immigration reform under president @entity35			1
but a big part of their job is to first persuade rank - and - file evangelicals to get on board			1
" there 's a misconception among people at the grass roots that the pathway to citizenship is amnesty , and it 's not , but we have to overcome that , " said @entity30 , who heads the law school at the university founded by @entity43			0
" there 's a lot of work to be done			0
" @entity55 and @entity26 have partnered with the rev. @entity56 , an influential @entity58 evangelical figure , and @entity59 -- former house speaker @entity61 's longtime spokesman and head of @entity65 's new values - based organization -- to try to draft a consensus evangelical position on immigration reform			1
" after securing our borders , we must allow the millions of undocumented and otherwise law - abiding persons living in our midst to come out of the shadows , " reads a recent draft of the document , which is still being finalized			0
" the pathway for earned legal citizenship or temporary residency should involve a program of legalization for undocumented persons in the @entity82			0
... " many conservatives say illegal immigrants should be forced to return to their home countries and start the process of legally coming to the @entity82 from scratch			0
@entity56 , who heads the @entity88 -- which represents about 16 million @entity58 evangelicals in the @entity82 -- says he 'll soon start presenting the document to @entity11 leaders like @entity65 , former @entity93 gov. @entity92 and @entity96 @entity95 candidate @entity94 in hopes that they sign on			1
" if the conservative evangelical community looks to the @entity11 and says , ' we demand integration reform , we demand a just assimilation strategy , ' that may be the tipping point in getting substantial @entity11 support for comprehensive immigration reform , " @entity56 said			1
the conservative evangelicals pushing comprehensive immigration reform say that undocumented workers should have to pay fines , clear background checks , learn @entity109 and take a civics class before being granted citizenship			2
many evangelicals say their push for immigration reform is biblically based , citing passages urging respect for civil laws and concern for migrants and the vulnerable			1
" discussion of immigration and government immigration policy must begin with the truth that every human being is made in the image of @entity127 , " the @entity119 said in a recent resolution backing comprehensive immigration reform			0
" ... @entity128 exemplifies respect toward others who are different in his treatment of the @entity132			0
" but evangelical leaders are also working to convince @entity11 that the party will lose @entity58 voters -- a fast - growing bloc -- if they take a strident line on immigration			1
the @entity29 's @entity26 said that @entity58 , like @entity140 white evangelicals , generally take a conservative approach to social issues like abortion and gay marriage , but that they often vote for @entity9 because of the immigration issue			2
" hispanics are hard - wired to be like us on sanctity of life , marriage and issues of faith , " said @entity26 , describing political similarities between @entity58 and white @entity29			0
" i 'm concerned about being perceived as being unwelcoming to them			0
" the last time @entity33 attempted immigration reform , under president @entity157 in 2007 , the project failed , largely because many conservatives and @entity11 said the plan 's inclusion of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the @entity82 was tantamount to amnesty			1
most major evangelical groups sat out the 2007 fight over immigration reform , but many , including the @entity119 , which represents 30 million @entity82 , have since taken up the cause			0
trying to apply the political lessons of 2007 , the evangelical leaders now pushing comprehensive immigration reform stress that the borders need to be secured as part of any reform package			2
" i look at the @entity7 law as a cry for help from a state that 's being inundated as a result of the federal government refusing to enforce its laws , " @entity26 said			2
but , he added , " i think the @entity7 law is the wrong way to attack the problem			0
" passed last month , the @entity7 law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question someone about their immigration status if they are in the process of enforcing some other law or ordinance			2
critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling , though supporters say a package of changes to the law signed by @entity7 gov. @entity201 addressed those concerns			0
many evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform say the law 's passage gave new urgency to their campaign , which had been under way since last year			1
@entity56 says he declined to join other @entity58 groups in calling for a boycott of @entity7 because he thought it would alienate white evangelicals at a time when he 's trying to win their support			2
still , @entity56 and the handful of conservative evangelical leaders promoting comprehensive immigration reform have yet to persuade some of the country 's most powerful evangelical groups -- including @entity219 and the @entity220 -- to come on board			1
" we 've been looking into this deeply but are n't ready to discuss our position , assuming we 'll get to one , " @entity222 , vice president of public policy at @entity219 , said in an e-mail message last week			0
even if such groups join their campaign , evangelicals backing comprehensive immigration reform may face another challenge : persuading the @entity231 to move forward with the plan after the bruising fight over health care reform .			0

some conservative evangelical leaders call @entity7 's new immigration law misguided
they want federal reform that includes path to citizenship for illegal immigrants
they 're trying to persuade rank - and - file evangelicals to get on board
many evangelicals call push for reform biblically based ; some want @entity11 to *woo* @entity58
