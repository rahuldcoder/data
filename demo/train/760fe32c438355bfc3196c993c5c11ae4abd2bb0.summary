-- in an effort to alleviate problems facing the company , @entity1 announced that it will close 600 company - run @entity6 stores over the next year			1
most of the stores are near another @entity1 and are n't profitable			1
@entity10 moved from @entity11 to @entity12 and sent friends this photo of her first ' houseguest ' -- @entity1			1
@entity0 asked @entity16 to respond to the news that the coffee giant , known for its saturation of the market , is shuttering some retail locations			1
@entity22 says he 's happy to see some @entity1 go , opening the market for independent coffee shops			1
@entity25 says he ca n't imagine how @entity1 is in financial trouble , given that his local store is always packed			1
@entity28 predicts more people will give up their lattes as the economy tightens			0
below are a selection of @entity34 responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity			0
ireport.com : share your thoughts on @entity1 here @entity43 : @entity1 , no doubt , has been a powerhouse phenomenon in the @entity6 barista world			1
the coffee super-giant has not only introduced , but set a national trend in coffee drinking for years to come ... they have created a culture			2
everywhere you look , from street corners , to bookstores and now even supermarkets , there is a @entity1 coffee shop or stand			1
so what will we do if we no longer have our daily dose of super-charged joe ? go somewhere else			0
since they started becoming a national chain , there has been a rush of smaller coffee shops trying to duplicate the relaxing , welcoming feel of @entity1 , and some do well and even exceed the patron 's expectations , offering sofa 's , tables , background music and even free internet			1
but what about the coffee ? as for those specialty drinks , many small coffee shop owners have started sending their employees to barista school , where they learn how to make the " perfect " cup of coffee / espresso with those perfect little beans			2
... it is possible we may see a new coffee shop in town ; and maybe , just maybe , the " next big thing "			2
@entity88 : i am glad to see @entity1 finally realized you only need one store per city block			1
i personally do not like or go to @entity1			2
i normally get my coffee from @entity94 on the way to work or buy grounds from them to make at home ... for a reasonable price			0
i already have to spend $ 4 a gallon on gas , why would i spend $ 4 for 12 oz of coffee ? cval : you 're kidding me , right ? anyone heard of the mr. coffee machine ? you can get one for $ 15 , and set it to have your coffee ready for you when you roll out of bed , then it turns off an hour later so as not to burn your house down should you forget to turn it off			2
@entity1 has always been a luxury item , when people need to get back to basics to survive			2
maybe people are just realizing this , and it is way overdue if you ask me			0
it 's as expensive as smoking , think of all the money you can put into savings if you brew your own coffee			0
@entity123 : " my @entity1 " , in the @entity125 section of @entity126 is much more than a place to get a cup of java			2
it is a real part of the community , a busy , urban , somewhat trendy area near downtown @entity133			0
i know each employee by name and they know me			0
i keep track of their progress through college , another 's budding music career , and will attend another 's wedding			0
when on the patio with my @entity145 , they bring him water to help beat the heat or whipped cream as a treat ... if you have ever spent time in the @entity153 ... you understand the social importance of meeting at the local pub.			0
. my @entity1 is the equivalent of that			2
you come there to get your favorite coffee but you leave with and come back for ... so much more			0
rusty1978 : well , amongst all the @entity1 frowners around , i must say it 's strong coffee and that 's how i like it			1
i 've got a @entity1 in commercial space in my building -- so convenient			2
i love the @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 blends			0
i just ca n't believe they 're not doing good business as most every store is always packed with people -- and they 've even raised their prices last year , so i ca n't understand the closings at all			0
yes , i prefer strong @entity1 coffee in the morning ! mattwilliams : could i live without @entity1 ? the answer is a resounding @entity180 ! i live in a small tourist town on the coast of @entity11			1
our many different local restaurants provide unique dining experiences with their atmospheres and menus			0
this is something i fear is being lost because of big chains like @entity1 coming in and replacing local , unique businesses with the same atmosphere and dining experience one could have in @entity193 , @entity6			2
so rather than make every little getaway town in this country the very same one @entity1 at a time , i say boycott them all and shut them all down ! that wo n't happen because @entity1 has become part of a routine for so many people			2
what would be nice is for the average @entity6 consumer to wake up and try to have a unique experience in his or her hometown			0
rather than going to that same @entity1 that is so convenient with its drive - thru and perfect location on the way to one 's destination , why not take a detour and find a mom - and - pop coffee shoppe , like our own @entity215 or @entity217 's , and support their brave attempt at making the landscape of where one lives unique			1
@entity221 : definitely a @entity1 junkie ! i moved from @entity11 to @entity12 last fall , and the first digital picture i sent my girlfriends once i arrived in @entity225 was a picture of my first official visitor to my new home ... a @entity229 ! grdpxjmpr : i absolutely could live without @entity1			1
reason 1 : i do n't like the taste of @entity1 coffee , especially since they had their closure back in february to make their coffee shop more like a coffee shop			1
the coffee they have started using since then is terrible			0
if the @entity1 chain would close some stores , it would allow mom - and - pop - type places to get a footing in the market or allow local smaller chains to expand			1
buying beans for home and making your own coffee is substantially less expensive than getting coffee every day from @entity1			1
in this economy , being able to pinch pennies helps			0
@entity253 : i hate to say this , but i just like a good ole cup of coffee , and that can not be found at a @entity1			1
even their most mild coffee is terribly bitter			0
will i miss them ? no. i would miss a 99 - cent cup of coffee from 7 - 11 worse than a $ 4.50 cup of yuck from @entity1			1
@entity265 : in my entire life , i have had exactly one coffee from @entity1			1
i 'm not a coffee snob , of course , but i do like a pure @entity272 roast			0
i get my caffeine fix at the local gas station			0
fresh brewed , $ 1.49			0
i predict overpriced microbrew beer is the next to take a hit as the economy gets real			0
@entity278 : yep , @entity1 is too pricey , too burnt and too mega for me ! gim me a hometown - y joint that ai n't too expensive and supports our veterans like @entity282 's , and i 'm ok ! : )			1

the @entity1 coffee chain announced *tuesday* it will shutter 600 stores
@entity0 readers respond to the news , *exchange* divided opinions of the coffee giant
@entity293 says as gas prices climb , pricey drink purchases will fall
