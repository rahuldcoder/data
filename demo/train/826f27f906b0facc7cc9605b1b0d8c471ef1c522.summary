-- they are some of the last thoughts of a serial killer , found on blood - soaked , handwritten and often poetic notes in his @entity6 jail cell after he took his own life			1
" speak soft in your ear so you know that it 's true			2
you may have been free , you loved living your lie , fate had its own scheme , crushed like a bug you still die , " @entity14 wrote			1
@entity19 killed himself in december			1
he was in custody in the killing of barista @entity23 , 18 , whom he abducted from a coffee stand in @entity27 , @entity6 , last february			2
@entity23 was one of at least eight people @entity19 admitted to killing , but he may have taken other lives , police have said			1
@entity19 ' notes were released by the @entity32 on wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau 's lab in @entity35 , @entity36			1
they were found under his body , written in a combination of pencil and ink on a yellow legal pad , the @entity32 said in a statement			2
the bureau said the notes do n't confirm any of his killings , add any new victims to his grisly toll , or offer any other clues that might help their investigation			2
it said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages			2
but a read of them does give a glimpse into @entity19 ' mind , apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of @entity66 society			1
" i looked in your eyes , they were so dark , warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care			0
the more guiless ( sp ) the gaze the better potential to fill up those pools with your fear , " @entity19 wrote at one point			1
" your wet lips were a promise of a secret unspoke			0
nervous laugh it burst like a pulse of blood from your throat			2
there will be no more laughter here , " he wrote later			0
" forget the lady called luck			0
she does not abide near me for her powers do n't extend to those who are deceased , " @entity19 also wrote			1
shortly after the killer 's suicide in december , @entity27 police detective @entity98 described @entity19 as a murder addict , saying police interviews with him showed he got " an immense amount of enjoyment " from killing			1
" @entity14 never expressed in any way , shape or form that he was ashamed of or regretted his actions , " @entity98 said in december			1
" he knew what he was and he was fine with it			0
" while he held no remorse , his writing indicates that he did n't think people in general cared for each other at all			0
" soon now , you 'll join those ranks of dead , or you 're ashes the wind will soon blow			0
@entity119 and friends will shed a few tears , pretend it 's off to heaven you go			0
but the reality is you were just bones and meat , and with your brain died also your soul , " @entity19 wrote			1
@entity19 criticizes @entity66 society elsewhere in the four pages			1
" consume what you do n't need , stars you idolize , pursue what you admit is a dream , then it 's @entity66 die , " he wrote			0
and he appears to rip the @entity66 worker			0
" punch in the clock and sit on your ass , playing stupid ass games on your phone			0
paper on your wall says you got smarts , but you still crawl like the vermin you are once your precious power grids blown , " @entity19 wrote			2
on the last page of the note , @entity19 may be referring to his impending suicide or to another of his victims , but his words are disturbing			1
" okay , all is over , words are flaccid and weak			0
back it with action or it all comes off as cheap			0
watch close while i work now , feel the electric of my touch , open my trembling flower , or your petals i 'll crush			0
