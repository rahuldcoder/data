-- november 13 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : what happens when history and controversy come together on a field trip ? we 'll explore the answer on today 's show			1
i 'm @entity23 , and this is @entity0 ! first up : @entity25 @entity26 , @entity27 : @entity27 army major @entity28 , a 39 - year - old psychiatrist assigned to @entity29 here at @entity4 , has been charged with 13 specifications of premeditated murder			1
@entity32 : that is the headline out of @entity4 today : 13 counts of premeditated murder			2
the charges have been made against @entity28			2
he 's the suspected gunman in last week 's attack			1
@entity39 officials say @entity28 could face more charges , as well			2
@entity28 's lawyer says that given the nature of the charges , he expects the legal process to be a " long and difficult road			1
" @entity45 @entity32 : and in health news , the impact of the @entity45 virus may be more widespread than originally thought			2
the @entity49 believes that the virus has caused nearly 3,900 deaths in the @entity27 in the first six months since the thing showed up			2
tha is a significant increase from earlier government reports			1
as of last month , officials estimate that 22 million people in the @entity27 had contracted @entity45			2
the government has ordered 75 million doses of the vaccine for the virus			2
a little more than 40 million of those are currently available			2
@entity62 @entity27 president @entity63 : it 's important that we do n't make any ill - considered decisions , even with the best of intentions , particularly at a time when our resources are so limited			1
but it 's just as important that we are open to any demonstrably good idea to supplement the steps we 've already taken to put @entity74 back to work			1
@entity76 @entity32 : president @entity63 talking about the state of the economy and explaining some of the reasons why he 's planning to hold a meeting about jobs			1
the forum is scheduled to take place next month			2
it 'll include representatives from large and small businesses , as well as workers and financial experts			2
the country has seen some recent economic growth , but as the president pointed out yesterday , it has not led to an increase in jobs			2
right now , the @entity27 unemployment rate is 10.2 percent			2
that is the highest it 's been in decades			1
@entity97 @entity32 : after making that announcement , president @entity63 headed to @entity99			1
it 's his first visit to the region since he was elected			1
he 's going to a meeting of the @entity97 , or @entity97			1
it 's a group of 21 countries that are responsible for more than half of the world 's economic power			1
the goal of the organization is to encourage economic growth in the region , something that 's been tough given recent , global financial problems			1
@entity114 looks at some of the topics on this weekend 's agenda			1
( begin video ) @entity119 , @entity120 , world business today : before the @entity97 in @entity6 , and security is tight			1
organizers leave nothing to chance as they prepare for one of the biggest events in the city - state 's history			1
it may look calm enough on the surface , but the undercurrents in the world trade are dangerous			2
it was only a year ago that this city was slammed by the global economic storm			1
@entity137 , @entity138 , @entity140 economist : it was huge			0
@entity143 showed its largest ever decline			0
@entity145 : this is one of the busiest shipping channels anywhere in the world			0
not surprising , really , when you consider that trade export is the lifeblood of this small @entity153 economy			0
now , it 's only fitting really that @entity97 gathers here this year to talk about the critical issue of global trade			1
@entity158 - @entity157 : i think probably the most concrete thing we 'll see out of @entity97 this week is a recommitment to free trade and the importance of free trade			1
@entity145 : that is exactly what business people like @entity168 are hoping for			0
his @entity6 - based @entity170 builds aerospace and transport systems and electronic equipment			0
most of the group 's $ 4 billion in revenues come from exports			1
@entity168 , @entity170 : the economy , the global economy , is still very soft , still very uncertain			1
is it a v or a @entity183 , i would n't guess which way			0
what it means is that there 's lots more work			1
@entity145 : he wants @entity97 to move faster to liberalize trade , but his key concern is protectionism			1
hock : when you have protectionism , it breeds disease whereby people will be so dependent on it			0
and the moment you remove it , you get lots of resistance			0
@entity145 : world leaders have already pledged to fight the rise of protectionism , and it will be on the @entity97 agenda as leaders look to @entity27 president @entity63 to help forge global agreements			1
@entity158 - @entity157 : with the crisis we 've been through , there have obviously been some protectionist tendencies beginning to rise , particularly in the western world			0
i hope we will see those quashed during the course of this week			0
( @entity220 ) controversial history lesson @entity32 : as we promised you at the beginning of today 's show , we 're gon na take you on a little field trip now			1
teachers often use these trips to give you experiences you just ca n't get in the classroom			0
at one former plantation in @entity231 , you can experience a time when cotton was king and slavery was the law			0
@entity237 from affiliate @entity238 explains how a lesson about the past raised serious concerns in the present			1
( begin video ) @entity244 , @entity238 reporter : @entity245 gives historical tours and lessons at the @entity248			0
@entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 : i am very , very enthusiastic about what i do in trying to get kids to think about how people did things during 1860 , 1861 , even before that period			0
@entity244 : but one @entity259 parent says @entity245 took his enthusiasm too far when he picked three black elementary school students out of a group of mostly white students to play the role of cotton picking slaves during a class trip			0
@entity249 : i was trying to be historically correct , not politically correct			0
@entity244 : @entity269 @entity268 president @entity267 disagrees			0
@entity270 , @entity269 @entity268 president : there is a lingering pain , a lingering bitterness , a lingering sense of insecurity and a lingering sense of inhumanity since slavery			0
because that 's still there , you want to be more sensitive than you want to be politically correct or historically correct			1
@entity244 : although @entity245 defends his decision , he says in the future he will take a different approach			0
@entity249 : i 'm going to actually start asking for volunteers instead of calling people from the audience			0
i think that would make it a lot easier			0
that way , if there 's someone who is afraid of public speaking or getting up in front of their peers , it would n't embarrass them			1
@entity302 : even if the black children had volunteered , i probably would have tried to use all of the children , for the effect that would have made them all feel equal in the experience			0
( @entity220 ) promo @entity32 : historically correct or politically correct ? which do you think is more important ? or maybe you have another way you would look at this whole topic			0
we want to know what you think			0
we 'd like you to share your thoughts on our blog at @entity317 ! but please remember , we only want your responses and your first names			0
please , only give us your first names on that			0
@entity322 @entity323 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to the teachers and students at @entity327 in @entity328 , @entity329 , who are celebrating their school 's 20th anniversary ! what is the world record for the amount of time it takes to eat a 12 - inch pizza ? is it : a ) 30 seconds , b ) 1 minute , 45 seconds , c ) 2 minutes , 10 seconds , @entity341 ) 3 minutes , 15 seconds ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a @entity344 man set the mark in 1 minute , 45 seconds			1
that 's just one of the amazing feats you 'll find in the @entity349			1
for some other entries ... off the @entity351 ( begin video ) @entity32 : oh boy			1
it 's another hands - on competition for a world record ! @entity357 may be the fastest man on two feet , but in terms of the human wheelbarrow , he 's neither as fast nor as loud as these fanatics in @entity361			1
they had a hand in @entity364 2009 , what the organization called a " celebration of all things superlative , " including everyone from daredevils to dancers to dune riders to cowpunchers			0
yes , there 's a record for most people lassoing , and it 's 23 ! in @entity378 , pasta played a record role			1
in @entity361 , people of 76 different nationalities sweated out a superlative in a sauna			0
but it was the @entity385 that hosted a record that 's indisputably hair - raising			2
a very headstrong competitor dragged an eight - ton bus by his hair ! @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 : he did it by tying a screw at the back of his head and attaching that orange lead to the bus itself			0
it took a few minutes ; he seemed like he was in a little pain			0
@entity32 : of course , it 's painful to look at ! but the 70 - foot distance was enough for a record and a headache , tying up our latest trip @entity408 ! ( @entity220 ) goodbye @entity32 : the bus probably deserves as much the record as much as the guy does , but who are we to split hairs			2
we 'll brush that one off and return on monday			0
