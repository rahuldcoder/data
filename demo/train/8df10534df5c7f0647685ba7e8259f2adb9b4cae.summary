" i just hope that nobody else gets infected			0
" " with the @entity4 doing so much to help us fight @entity2 , and again one of our compatriots did n't take due care , and so , he 's gone there and ... put some @entity4 in a state of fear , and put them at some risk , and so i feel very saddened by that and very angry with him , to tell you the truth			1

up to 100 people being contacted health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with @entity0 , a spokeswoman with the @entity163 said thursday			1
these are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital , at his apartment complex or in the community			2
" out of an abundance of caution , we 're starting with this very wide net , including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient 's home , " spokeswoman @entity169 said			0
" the number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection			0
" the number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is " more than 12 , " a federal official told @entity23 on thursday			0
" by the end of the day , we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are , " the official said			0

custodians are stepping up cleanup work at the schools , he said			0
" we do n't think there 's any virus at any of those buildings , but we 'll take that off the table , so we 're doing extra cleaning and disinfecting , " @entity224 said			0
others are upset at the hospital where @entity0 first sought care , which sent him home and raised the possibility he could infect others for at least two additional days			1
@entity4 president @entity243 contacted @entity126 mayor @entity244 on thursday to make sure @entity126 was getting the federal resources it needs " to treat the patient safely , and control this case so that it does not spread widely , " the @entity242 said			0
your @entity2 questions answered should @entity4 worry about getting @entity2 ? how @entity2 spreads hospital : ' flaw ' in electronic records hid travel history on september 24 , four days after he arrived in @entity126 from @entity8 , @entity0 started feeling symptoms			1
that day is significant because that 's when he started being contagious			0
late the following night , he went to @entity257 with a low - grade fever and abdominal pain , the hospital said			0

" it was a mistake			0
they dropped the ball , " dr. @entity271 , director of the @entity272 , said of the miscommunication at the hospital			0
" you do n't want to pile on them , but hopefully this will never happen again			0
... the @entity94 has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history			1
" why did n't doctors know @entity0 had been to @entity8 ? the hospital said thursday night that a " flaw " in its electronic health records prevented doctors from seeing @entity0 's travel history even though he shared it on his first visit to the hospital			1
@entity0 told a nurse he 'd been in @entity26 , but that information was entered into a document that is n't automatically visible to physicians , @entity257 said in a statement thursday			2
after discovering this , the hospital says it has changed the system so doctors and nurses will see travel history documentation			1
" we feel that this change will improve the early identification of patients who may be at risk for communicable diseases , including @entity2 , " the hospital said			1
the hospital released a detailed description of what it said was the chain of events when @entity0 first came to the hospital on september 25			2
" in the interest of transparency , and because we want other @entity4 hospitals and providers to learn from our experience , we are , with mr. @entity0 's permission , releasing this information , " the hospital said			1
nurses and doctors at the hospital followed protocols , the hospital said			0
" when mr. @entity0 was asked if he had been around anyone who had been ill , " the statement said , " he said that he had not			2
