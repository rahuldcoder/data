@entity0 is the latest state to allow testing of @entity4 's self - driving cars on the roads , though only with a human passenger along as a safety measure			1
gov. @entity8 signed the autonomous - vehicles bill into law tuesday afternoon alongside @entity4 co-founder @entity11 and state sen. @entity12 , who authored the bill , at @entity4 's headquarters in @entity15 , @entity0			1
the bill , @entity17 1298 , will set up procedures and requirements for determining when the cars are road - ready			1
@entity11 hopes that self - driving cars will be able to drive on public streets in five years or less			1
you wo n't need a driver 's license by 2040 " anybody who first gets in the car and finds the car is driving will be a little skittish			0
but they 'll get over it , " said @entity8 when asked if the @entity29 was on board with the plan			0
the cars use a combination of technologies , including radar sensors on the front , video cameras aimed at the surrounding area , various other sensors and artificial - intelligence software that helps steer			2
@entity4 is the most visible company working on these types of vehicles , but similar projects are under way at other organizations , including @entity48			2
@entity4 has already been testing the cars on the road in @entity51 , which passed a law last year authorizing driverless vehicles			2
both @entity51 and @entity0 require the cars to have a human behind the wheel who can take control of the vehicle at any time			2
so far , the cars have have racked up more than 300,000 driving miles , and 50,000 of those miles were without any intervention from the human drivers , @entity4 says			1
overheard on @entity65 : autonomous cars reduce ' crashes ' ? there have been no accidents while the cars were controlled by the computer			0
the only documented accident with one of the @entity4 vehicles was a fender bender that took place while a human was in control			2
@entity11 , who sported a pair of @entity4 glasses at the media event without comment , said the cars could address a variety of current transportation issues			1
first and foremost , he said , the self - driving cars would be safer than human - driven cars			1
there were just under 33,000 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in the @entity91 in 2010			0
they also could ferry around people who are usually unable to to drive , such as blind people			0
" some people have other disabilities , some people are too young , some people are too old , sometimes we 're too intoxicated , " said @entity11			0
ideally , a car that drives itself can minimize traffic by chaining together with other self - driving vehicles and using highways more efficiently			1
drivers would n't be limited to listening to @entity105 and honking during their morning commute ; instead they could use that time to be productive , like the millions of people who take public transit currently do			0
@entity110 turns to variable speed limits to ease traffic @entity11 also discussed the many parking lots in urban and suburban areas , calling them " a scar to the surface of the @entity117			2
" self - driving cars would be able to drop you off at work and then pick up another person instead of idling in a parking lot			1
if you did opt to own your own car , it could park itself in the most efficient way possible			0
@entity126 , a consumer - rights group , has expressed reservations about the cars on privacy grounds , saying they would allow @entity4 to gather personal information about passengers			1
@entity4 's fleet of vehicles started with @entity134 and later added the @entity135 , a crossover suv , to test on different terrain			0
the project is directed by @entity138 , who also co-founded @entity139			0
there are many legal and technical problems still to be worked out before the cars are commonplace			0
asked who would get the ticket when a driverless car runs a red light , @entity11 replied , " self - driving cars do not run red lights			1
" you can drive 85 - in @entity150			0

gov. @entity152 signs a bill that will *regulate* self - driving cars in @entity0
@entity4 co-founder @entity11 hopes to have self - driving cars on public roads within five years
@entity11 says self - driving cars address safety , traffic and *lifestyle* issues
