-- a man convicted of crimes in connection with @entity5 's organized - crime family claims to know where @entity8 boss @entity7 's body was buried in 1975			1
@entity10 , 85 , told @entity12 's @entity11 that @entity7 was buried in a @entity14 field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen on july 30 , 1975			1
" i 'm as certain as i could possibly be , " @entity10 told the station			0
" if i had money , i 'd like to bet a big sum of money that he 's buried ( there )			2
" @entity10 said the plan was to bury @entity7 in a shallow grave , then move his body to a different location			2
the latter part of the plan fell through , and his body was left in @entity28 , @entity14			0
in an interview with @entity0 on monday , former @entity30 attorney and chief of the @entity32 of @entity14 's @entity34 @entity33 said there are very few people , if any , who would be more likely to know about @entity7 's disappearance than @entity10			1
" @entity39 was in a very high position within the @entity5 organized crime family for decades , " @entity33 said			1
" this is a man who would have been in the know about all matters , especially what happened to @entity7			2
" vanished @entity7 still fascinates after almost 40 years @entity33 , who prosecuted @entity10 in several cases in the 1980s and ' 90s , says @entity10 was the head of the @entity5 organized crime family from 1970 - 1975 , but was in prison himself when @entity7 disappeared			1
in 2005 , @entity10 was sentenced to 71 months in prison for racketeering and extortion			0
he was released in 2008			0
in his interview with @entity11 , @entity10 denied playing any part in @entity7 's disappearance , and said @entity7 did not deserve what happened to him			2
" if i was n't away ( in prison ) i do n't think it would have ever happened , " @entity10 told the station			0
" that 's the only thing i can tell you			0
" the @entity62 declined to comment on @entity10 's claims			1
@entity33 , however , told @entity0 he thinks the @entity62 will be taking @entity10 's words seriously , and will likely see if they can acquire a search warrant for the property in @entity14			2
@entity7 's disappearance and presumed death has vexed investigators for almost four decades			2
as recently as october , soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban @entity5 community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after @entity7 disappeared in 1975			1
the soil samples were tested , and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition			0
one of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded a great deal of sway in many elections -- and when some unions were notoriously tied to organized crime -- @entity7 was forced out of the organized - labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			1
then - president @entity92 pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980			0
@entity7 , then 62 , was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside a @entity5 - area restaurant			1
he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity5 mob enforcer @entity97 and @entity100 crime family figure @entity98 , who was also a chief of a @entity8 local in @entity102			1
@entity97 died in 1982 ; @entity98 died in 1988 in prison			0
@entity7 believed @entity97 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity7 and @entity98 , but @entity7 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity62			1
@entity97 and @entity98 later told the @entity62 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
the @entity62 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity7 's efforts to regain power in the @entity8 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
" i 'd like to just prove to everybody that i 'm not crazy , " @entity10 told @entity11 4			0
" what happened , happened while i was in jail , and i feel very , very bad about it ... ( it ) should have never happened to @entity121			0
