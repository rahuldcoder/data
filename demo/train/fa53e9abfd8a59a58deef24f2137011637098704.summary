@entity0 , @entity1 -- " the last beekeeper " will change the way you see honeybees			1
a scene from " the last beekeeper , " premiering this weekend on the @entity10 cable channel			1
you may find yourself rescuing a tiny bee you see struggling in a puddle of water			1
instead of fearing its sting , you may think about the role honeybees play in putting food on your table			1
the documentary , which premieres saturday on the cable channel @entity10 , explores the " intimate relationship " between humans and bees through the eyes of three struggling @entity27 beekeepers			1
" you suddenly realize that even though they look like insects , when you really look at them they take on these personalities , " said producer @entity28			2
@entity34 -- the professional title for bee scientists -- estimate that one out of every three bites of food you eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees			1
alarming headlines two years ago about the mysterious disappearance of honeybees prompted filmmakers to follow beekeepers from @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 as they traveled with their colonies to pollinate @entity1 's massive almond crop			1
director @entity51 said they wanted to show " more than what was in the paper " about the mystery			2
" there is a really powerful connection between a human being and a bee because we 've tended bees for thousand of years , " @entity56 said			2
" it 's such an old tradition and bees are incredibly sophisticated , evolved creatures			2
" the cameras rolled as these beekeepers faced " colony collapse disorder , " a still unexplained phenomenon which scientists estimate has wiped out almost a third of the domestic honeybee hives in the @entity27			1
nomadic beekeepers truck their bee colonies across the country , following the pollination seasons for almonds , apples , cotton and other crops dependent on their insects			1
@entity82 , who inherited her father 's @entity47 beekeeping business last year , said it 's a roller coaster ride for both the bees and the beekeepers			1
" you can have a high this month and all of the sudden you can run into something , and the bees start starving to death , " @entity82 said			2
bees are loaded on trucks in january for a cross-country ride to @entity1 to pollinate almonds for a few weeks			2
their next stop may be @entity99 apple orchards for the spring pollination			0
the changes interrupt their natural rhythms , @entity82 said			0
" it 's like putting you on a strict diet and that 's all i feed you for the next month , " she said			0
" and i pick you up and i shake your house and i take you down the road , which is pretty stressful , and then i move you to a new location , and , guess what , for the next six weeks , now , i 've changed your temperature and now i 'm only going to give you watermelon			0
" the travel also exposes the bees to a variety of pesticides , adding to their stress , she said			0
and mites , believed to have been brought in by bees that were imported to replace lost hives , are also a problem , she said			0
the film does not offer an answer to what 's killing the honeybees			1
but @entity82 said researchers are " getting real close " to identifying a virus as the main culprit			0
in one poignant moment in the documentary , the cameras capture one of the beekeepers breaking down in tears after lying to his wife to hide the fact that he lost most of his bees			1
" it 's a tragedy , that silent moment in the bee yard when you realize you are surrounded by death , " @entity51 said			0
" it 's a very powerful , very sad moment			0
" along with the loss of their livestock , @entity27 beekeepers face tough competition from less expensive imported honey -- especially from @entity153 and @entity154 , @entity82 said			1
she planned to sell her bees after last year 's disappointing year , but the prices being offered for them was " literally nothing			0
" but this year has been better , with fewer lost colonies , she said			0
" bees really become a part of us , we learn so much all the time , " she said			0
" one really neat thing , when you 're around enough hives , as soon as you open it , you can hear from the energy of the hive how they are doing			0
they are the voice of mother nature			0
