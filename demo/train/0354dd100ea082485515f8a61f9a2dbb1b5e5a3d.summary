editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published in december by @entity10			0
@entity2 writes widely about current events			2
president @entity14 is taking a huge step in his presidency			1
after weeks of careful deliberation , the president has sided with military officials who have been pushing for an escalation of @entity22 forces in @entity23			0
explaining his objectives and exit strategy , @entity14 is expected to announce that he will be sending 30,000 troops , and possibly more , into the region			2
with this decision , @entity14 inches closer to becoming a wartime president			1
even though the @entity32 insists that they will continue to work hard on their domestic agenda , historically , presidents who become involved in protracted ground wars find that their presidencies are defined by their military conflicts			1
the politics that surround a military operation play an enormous role in the political success or failure of an administration			0
speaker @entity42 and many congressional @entity43 realize the human and political risks that come from this war			0
as news broke of president @entity14 's decision , @entity42 said : " the @entity22 people believe that if something is in our national security interest , we have to be able to afford it			1
that does n't mean that we hold everything else " stagnant because of those operations			0
but war sucks the political oxygen out of almost any presidency			0
there have been several modern presidents who started their term with an ambitious domestic vision and who ended up with their presidencies totally consumed by war			1
president @entity67 , who served from 1945 to 1953 , pulled off a historic upset in his reelection bid against @entity70 in 1948			1
in the campaign , @entity67 castigated a " do - nothing " @entity72			2
when he returned to the @entity32 after the election , @entity67 fought for an ambitious domestic agenda in 1949 and 1950 , which he called the @entity75 , which included national health care , civil rights , fair housing and more			1
while a conservative coalition of southern @entity43 and @entity81 in @entity72 defeated most of his proposals , it was the @entity83 , which began in the summer of 1950 , that brought down his presidency			0
when the military operations against @entity87 bogged down into a stalemate by 1951 , republicans ripped into the administration for refusing to use enough air power against the communists			0
@entity67 , whose approval ratings plummeted to 23 percent by 1952 , decided that he should not run for reelection			2
" if we had been less trusting , if we had been less soft and weak , there would probably have been no war in @entity87 ! " @entity81 candidate and military hero gen. @entity97 said on the campaign trail			0
republicans focused their campaign on @entity87 , @entity102 and corruption			0
the @entity43 nominee , @entity104 , lost ; republicans gained control of @entity72			0
president @entity107 was on the verge of becoming a transformative president in the winter of 1965			1
since taking office , @entity107 had presided over the passage of a sweeping body of domestic measures unequaled by almost any president in @entity22 history other than @entity117			1
his accomplishments included @entity119 and @entity120 , federal education assistance , civil rights and voting rights , environmental regulations , immigration reform and much more			0
yet all those accomplishments seemed to disappear in the political psyche after the " @entity128 " of the war in the spring of 1965 , when @entity107 authorized a vast increase of ground troops to @entity132			1
by 1968 , public opinion had turned against the war , with anti-war protesters organizing against " @entity136			0
" in the history books , @entity132 has swamped our memory of @entity107 's presidency and eclipsed much of what he accomplished in those early years			2
" that bitch of a war , " @entity107 lamented toward the end of his life , " killed the lady i really loved -- the @entity145			1
" most recently , there was the experience of president @entity152			1
during the 2000 campaign and in the early months of his presidency , @entity152 pushed for a type of " compassionate conservatism " that sought to extend certain kinds of government programs and establish the framework for a broad @entity81 coalition that captured the center and right			2
the @entity163 extended the reach of the federal government into the nation 's grade schools			0
after 9/11 , @entity152 led a successful operation to knock the @entity169 out of power in @entity23 and dramatically reorganized homeland security			2
but once @entity152 sent troops to @entity174 to bring down @entity175 in 2003 , the war came to dominate everything else			1
as the reconstruction of @entity174 proved to be much more difficult than the @entity32 anticipated , @entity152 's popularity plummeted			2
in 2006 , @entity43 took control of @entity72 and in 2008 @entity14 , on a platform defined by his opposition to @entity174 , was elected president			1
there are modern presidents who have balanced their agendas and preserved domestic policy as an integral part of their political identity even after having sent troops to war			1
this was the certainly the case with @entity117 who protected many of his domestic programs and even expanded government into new areas at home as the war unfolded			2
but @entity117 is an exception to the rule			0
soon @entity14 will be significantly expanding an existing military operation , making this war his own			1
in doing so , he will be risking a huge amount of his potential impact as a president			0
to make matters even worse , unlike @entity107 , @entity14 has had more trouble pushing much of his domestic agenda through @entity72			1
while he will very likely walk away from this year with a victory on health care , most of his agenda remains bottled up			0
it is easy to see how @entity23 can quickly grow in scale and scope			0
it would be a tragedy if a politician who headed a historic campaign based on the promise of extracting the @entity22 from a very unpopular war would wind up bogged down in a quagmire of his own			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			2

with his troop decision , @entity14 becomes a wartime president , says @entity226
he says other presidents have seen wars *swallow* up their domestic plans
@entity2 says @entity67 , @entity107 , @entity152 were weakened by war
