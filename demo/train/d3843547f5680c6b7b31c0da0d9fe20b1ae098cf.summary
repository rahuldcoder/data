@entity4 , @entity2 searchers have located a majority of @entity8 's fuselage in the @entity9 , the head of @entity2 's search and rescue agency said wednesday , raising the prospect that many bodies of the 162 people aboard the flight that crashed last month will soon be found			1
the confirmation follows major developments in the investigation of the disaster -- the recoveries earlier this week of the plane 's flight data and cockpit voice recorders			1
searchers saw the plane 's main body , with one of its wings attached , via a camera carried by a remotely operated underwater vehicle , @entity2 search chief @entity22 said			1
@entity31 in identifying the debris are the words painted on the section			0
pictures released by the search agency appear to show portions of the words " now " and " everyone			0
" @entity8 says the slogan " now everyone can fly " had been on the length of the plane , which crashed december 28 as it flew toward @entity43 from the @entity2 city of @entity45			1
divers will search the fuselage for bodies thursday , and if the divers encounter trouble , crews may lift the fuselage out of the water , @entity22 said			1
officials did n't mention the depth of the water			1
but officials have said other debris , such as the recorders -- which were found about a half mile from the fuselage on monday and tuesday -- were discovered at a depth of roughly 30 meters ( 100 feet )			1
at least 50 bodies have been recovered from the sea , @entity22 said			1
some were strapped into seats			0
officials have said that many of the more than 100 remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane 's fuselage			1
the majority of the people on @entity8 were @entity2			1
citizens of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity43 and @entity78 also were aboard			1
@entity22 said the discovered portion of the fuselage is about 100 feet long			1
that would represent the majority of the @entity83 , which was about 120 feet long			0
authorities do n't know why the plane crashed			2
roughly 35 minutes into the flight , the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather			0
minutes later , the plane disappeared from radar			2
on tuesday , divers retrieved the cockpit voice recorder , which is designed to retain all sounds on a plane 's flight deck			2
a day earlier , searchers recovered the plane 's other key information source , the flight data recorder , which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft 's performance , including air speed and cabin pressure			1
both devices are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong			0
the flight data recorder tells investigators what happened on a plane , but the cockpit voice recorder tells them why , said @entity115 , a senior official at @entity2 's @entity116 , which is leading the investigation into the disaster			1
" the ' why ' is mostly in there , " he said of the voice recorder , which captures conversations between pilots , as well as other sounds in the cockpit			0
the two flight recorders were taken to a lab in @entity4 , the @entity2 capital , for analysis			2
investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices			0
but @entity115 cautioned that interpreting the information requires much more time			0
after the download , investigators should have " a pretty good idea within a couple of days " of what happened aboard the plane , @entity132 , a former inspector general of the @entity134 @entity133 , said this week			1
the flight data recorder usually contains hundreds of parameters and thousands of data points , she said , that look a bit like an electrocardiogram when they 're printed			2
@entity115 said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash			0
but it 's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what 's already been made public			0
the final report containing investigators ' full conclusions will take months , @entity115 said			0
the agency 's final report into @entity158 -- which crashed in @entity2 waters on @entity160 2007 , killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after that disaster			2
@entity115 said the @entity8 plane 's flight data recorder was in good condition after being pulled out of the water from under the debris of a wing monday			1
the recovery of the recorders took place after the plane 's tail was lifted from the waves saturday			1
observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water , not when it was still at a high altitude			2
one @entity2 search official , who goes by the single name of @entity185 , said that the debris patterns suggest the aircraft " exploded " on impact			2
but the country 's transportation investigators said it was premature to say what had happened , and one expert questioned the search official 's choice of words			0
" the word ' exploded ' i think maybe loses a little bit in translation , " said @entity197 , a former @entity198 safety inspector			0
" i think really what he 's meaning is a rupture from the impact itself			0
" as with any hollow object hitting something very hard , the pressure differential between the outside and the inside is very significant , and it 'll actually tear apart the aircraft on the top , " @entity197 said			0
" that may be what he 's referring to			0
" @entity5 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 , and journalist @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
