-- hours after losing @entity3 to injury , organizers of the @entity2 were dealt another major blow on wednesday when @entity6 also pulled out of the event			1
the 31 - year - old @entity6 , who became the oldest women 's tennis player to be crowned world no. 1 on monday , said she was forced out because of a back injury			1
" i 've just had some back problems the past couple of weeks , " the @entity13 told an impromptu press conference			1
" i thought it would get better as the week went on but it did n't			0
i do n't want to keep pushing it and make it worse			0
" @entity6 took to the court to apologize to fans who had arrived for her second - round match with @entity23 of @entity24			1
the absences of both @entity6 and previous @entity26 represent a severe dent to a popular $ 2 million tournament which had already been without the sport 's two reported highest earners , @entity31 and @entity32 ( according to @entity33 )			2
it is also a blow to the @entity36 , which has worked hard to introduce incentives and regulations to reduce the number of withdrawals from its events			0
wednesday 's unexpected withdrawal follows that of second - ranked @entity3 , which ensured that @entity6 will hang on to top spot until the @entity46 , which starts in @entity46 on march 18			1
@entity6 said her back also troubled her in last week 's @entity48 , where she was beaten in the final by the @entity50 , who withdrew from the @entity53 championships with a foot injury			1
the 15 - time grand slam winner added that , having returned to the pinnacle after two and a half years during which her life and career were threatened following a freak foot injury in 2010 , being no. 1 is no longer her primary goal			0
" ok , i have done it , let 's focus on my next goals which are the grand slams , " @entity6 said , admitting that she already had at least half an eye on the @entity64 in @entity65 , starting on may 26			2
" i really want to continue doing really well in those			0
" after winning @entity72 and the @entity73 last year , @entity6 ' total of grand slam titles is only three fewer than @entity74 and @entity75 , who together are second on the all - time list behind @entity77 with 22			2
@entity6 ' absence increases the chances of world no. 4 @entity80 making a successful defense of her title , which began with the @entity83 grinding out a 7 - , 6 - 3 win over @entity85 , a promising 18 - year - old wild card entry from @entity87			2
@entity23 , who received a wild - card invite after making a late entry , will face former world no. 1 @entity89 in the quarterfinals			0
the @entity91 , now ranked 10th and a winner of the tournament in 2011 , progressed with a 6 - 0 6 - 1 drubbing of @entity96 's former @entity72 semifinalist @entity95			0
