-- @entity1 , a devoted @entity3 guest , often visits the posh hotel , and the staff joyously greets him as he strides along the lobby 's marble floor			0

@entity0 : @entity31 's best dog - friendly hotels it 's not uncommon for a hotel to be pet - friendly these days			1
" @entity31 is more pet obsessed than ever , " said @entity34 , pet expert for the @entity35			1
" we see them as part as part of the family			0
" but some luxury properties go to such extremes to cater to pets that the line between man and man 's best friend is a bit , well , fuzzy			1
pet bathrobes , pet massages , and pet treadmills are becoming practically de rigueur at five - star hotels these days			1
@entity56 's @entity55 at @entity57 , for example , has doggy @entity58			0
hotels are also competing for @entity62 's affection with food			1
the @entity65 , @entity64 offers grilled beef tenderloin , while @entity68 ' @entity67 ­ so features made - to - order dishes for pets with special dietary needs			1
the list of extras does n't stop with food , especially for chains like @entity76 , which has taken pet pleasing to new heights			1
when the surf 's up at @entity81 , in @entity82 , pups can join @entity83 , where poodles and bulldogs alike can take a shot at catching a wave			0
and if you 've dreamed of your pup becoming the next @entity90 , the @entity91 in @entity92 offers voice - coaching lessons and the chance to cut a cd			2
so what gives ? are n't we recovering from a recession ? " with the economy in bad shape , people cut back on their own luxuries , but not on their pets , " explains @entity34			2
" for many , indulging their pet is more rewarding than indulging themselves			2
" but some of these programs are focused on giving back as well			0
the @entity108 donated $ 1 from each signature drink ordered during its " @entity110 " this spring to help a local dog park			0
the hotel even invited the @entity113 to bring four - legged friends to the event to encourage adoptions			1
some of these pets may even become hotel guests			1
" there 's nothing like when you 've had a bad day and you come home to your dog smiling and beaming unconditional love , " says @entity3 concierge @entity22			0
" why should n't you have that when you 're in a hotel ? " @entity0 : weirdest animal smuggling incidents the @entity129 @entity12 , @entity130 before arrival , the staff contacts all guests to see if they have special needs or requests -- of course , this includes four - legged visitors as well			1
but there 's plenty that comes with the @entity142 package , too , like wrought - iron pet beds , 22 - karat gold plated @entity146 tags , and home - baked dog treats			1
and when water is pouring down from the sky , both pet and owner can borrow @entity153 raincoats			2
@entity67 ­ so , @entity68 a stress - reducing neck massage is the perfect antidote to a long flight , no matter whether that neck is human or canine			2
and at this @entity162 resort , pets can also enjoy the beach or pool in a portable pet cabana			1
when it 's time to dine , the @entity167 menu ( served in metallic bowls with faux gem stones ) features items like @entity172 ( shredded braised beef and steamed rice ) or made - to - order dishes for pets with special dietary needs			1
@entity76 , @entity92 , @entity178 sure , there 's gourmet room service and luxurious bedding at @entity92 's @entity91 , but you can also have your pup cut a cd in a professional recording session			2
after being shuttled to a recording studio in a limo , dogs work with a voice coach ( ! ) and howl along with a musician or bark to their favorite karaoke tune			0
it 's part of the chain 's vacation for pets learning camps , which includes @entity83 at the @entity200 in @entity201 where pups can learn to catch a wave			2
the @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity12 , @entity206 humans have ergonomic chairs , so why should n't pets have the same for their bowls ? that 's just one of the perks at the @entity3 , where they also receive monogrammed paw - printed towels and scented poop bags			1
at the @entity206 , treats include special room - service dishes like the @entity219 with corn and chopped beef or @entity222			2
and the @entity223 offers a personalized menu option with the pet 's preferred brand of food			1
@entity228 , @entity12 , @entity229 side - by - side massages are usually meant for two humans , but at @entity12 's @entity233 , the " @entity235 - icure " the second creature should be canine			1
@entity228 properties have always featured a special devotion to animals , and that dedication has only grown ; today , each property welcomes the pet on the lobby activities board , and many have a resident pup			1
at the @entity229 's @entity246 it 's @entity247 -- a cocker spaniel " @entity248 " named after @entity250 , shortstop for the @entity251			0
@entity0 : most outrageous hotel concierge requests @entity254 , @entity68 your pet may not need a passport to travel to @entity162 , but that does n't mean he does n't want one			2
hotel staff will take your pup 's photo for a " @entity263 " ( written in , um , " paw - lish " ) and marked with a @entity266 passport stamp			2
once you both make it through immigration , @entity62 will find gourmet menu offerings like organic roasted chicken , beef tenderloin , and steamed @entity273 salmon			2
pets can even relax in poolside doggie cabanas			0
@entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 there are no toga - clad waiters serving your dog grapes , but the hotel does offer four - course pet meals of fish , game , or vegetable soup in @entity288 dog bowls ( and on golden trays to boot )			1
when it 's a little chilly in the @entity278 , order an @entity293 cashmere sweater with your pup 's name written in rhinestones			0
but @entity62 may not want to wear it during his visit to @entity299 , a nearby dog spa , for his green - clay and aloe vera skin - and - hair - revitalizing massage			0
@entity108 , @entity303 even pets have stressful days and ( like their owners ) need a happy hour			0

and for the stylish dog , there are bathrobes with the @entity65 logo emblazoned in blue or pink @entity344 crystals			0
the @entity345 , @entity346 who does n't like welcome gifts -- especially if they include a cookie , commemorative bowl , and placemat ? the @entity352 also features a special room - service menu with @entity354 , a hearty vegetable stir - fry with poached eggs , steamed brown rice , and salmon , which is perfect fuel for taking your pet on a walk around the property 's 39 landscaped acres ( the hotel provides a map of the trails )			1
@entity366 and @entity55 , @entity367 , @entity56 @entity58 is n't just for humans			0
