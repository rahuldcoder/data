@entity0 -- " keep calm and carry on " is a catchphrase that @entity3 first adopted during @entity4 -- and while the country may not be at war anymore , it 's become a motto as we continue to fight our own personal battles			1
@entity10 of @entity11 redefined the spirit of the phrase in the past week -- her new motto could easily be : " keep calm and carry on with a smile			1
" you can only imagine what was going through her mind when she stepped out in front of a vast media presence in @entity21 last friday , knowing everyone there had seen pictures of her topless , after photos of her on holiday were published overnight in a @entity30 magazine			1
a palace source said she was upset			2
the irony , of course , was that that day she was dressed as conservatively as she could be , because she was visiting a mosque			2
i 've watched @entity36 up close for the past year and a half and seen how she conducts herself in public in the context of the frenzy around her ; in fact , i am part of it			1
there is no way i could look that calm and collected knowing that everything i was doing was being scrutinized in such detail			1
she performs impeccably every time			2
she never stumbles and always makes it look easy			2
she copes by being in control			2
she prepares assiduously for everything she does in public and knows exactly what 's expected of her and where her limits are			2
@entity57 greeted by topless dancers make no mistake , the @entity36 is smart as a button and a natural public figure			1
but what i did n't realize was just how steely her character was			2
she has not just become a member of the royal family -- she 's becoming its anchor			1
@entity69 was less able to hide his emotions			2
at the airport as he left @entity21 , he had a face like thunder			2
he was furious with closer magazine for violating the couple 's privacy and humiliating his wife			0
he had spent the day locked in discussions behind the scenes with a view to suing the magazine , commandeering the original photos and prosecuting the editor and photographer			0
this was something neither of them was going to take lying down			0
a red line had been crossed , the palace told me			0
by the time the couple reached @entity92 they had relaxed a bit			0
perhaps it was the isolation of the jungle , but @entity69 even had time to joke with an approved photographer who was dangling from a tree			0
@entity69 may work with the media , but he hates the paparazzi			0
this goes back to his childhood , where even at primary school he was overheard moaning about " ' tographers			0
" it was also the @entity30 paparazzi who pursued his mother and surrounded her car as she lay dying following a crash in @entity110			0
@entity36 's strength is that she does n't have @entity69 's background			1
she was brought up out of the public eye in the idyllic @entity115 countryside with a stable , happy family			1
she was only exposed to media intrusion as a grown up , when she was better armed to handle it			0
@entity3 privacy should start with @entity3 press that does n't mean it 's been easy for her			0
before she was married , she fled @entity125 because she was being pursued so aggressively by paps , with all the vile expletives they use grab attention			0
but she does have a strength of character that allows her to cope , and that 's a virtue that was on full display here in the @entity135			1
she is bolstering her understandably more fragile husband			0
when they arrived here the @entity137 and @entity10 received a rapturous welcome			0
i met them and they were clearly heartened by their reception and managing to put the legal battle at the back of their minds , at least in public			0
by the time they reached the final stop on their @entity155 tour , and news came in that they had won their civil case against @entity160 , they completely let go , dancing and giggling away			1
when the phrase " keep calm and carry on " was first adopted it was all about hiding your emotions with a straight face			1
@entity36 and @entity69 are doing that with a smile			1
in @entity0 , they were n't just coping -- they were separating their public and their private lives , and that 's what they want the media to do			1
@entity69 will one day be king and is taking on more and more responsibilities from his grandmother			0
in @entity36 , he has found his " strength and stay " -- a phrase the @entity180 used to describe her own husband and rock prince @entity183			1
this tour has shown @entity69 could n't have found anyone stronger in his future queen			1
@entity187 : the backward view of women 's bodies			0
