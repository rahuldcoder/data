-- on my first visit to @entity4 , at the age of 18 , i fell in love with the country and its amazing history almost at first sight , as i and my friends sailed across the lagoon on the ferry to @entity12			1
when we returned and found our camper van had been emptied out by thieves , i felt a little less enamored , to say the least			2
this was my first glimpse of the split personality of a country that is expressed nearly 40 years later in the title of my 2012 book , " @entity22 , @entity4 , " and is the theme of the new film i have just narrated for the @entity26 director @entity25 , " @entity24 "			1
yet what i did n't realize then , as a ( fairly ) innocent teenager , was quite how significant @entity4 's history is for the whole of the @entity31			1
the greatest case study , or cautionary tale , comes from @entity12 itself			2
in medieval times @entity35 , as @entity12 is known , became the richest and most powerful city - state in the @entity38			0
it was run by a quasi-democratic " grand council " , made up of the merchants who were making the city rich , an elite that was open to newcomers if they had new ideas and new energies			0
but in the 14th century the elite decided to close its doors to newcomers , allowing in only those related by family to the old guard , and nationalizing trading rights			0
the decline of @entity12 began with that decision			0
@entity4 today is like a huge re-run of that sad @entity59 story			1
during the 1950s and 1960s , the country was @entity66 's own " emerging economy " of the period , enjoying the third fastest average annual gdp growth rate in the world during those decades , beaten only by @entity63 and @entity64			1
it was helped by the global move towards freer trade and by the early @entity71 , but also by its own then very dynamic society and economy			2
new , entrepreneurial companies were formed , new ideas blossomed ; @entity4 became a pioneering center for design , for cinema , and for fashion , and the migration of millions of workers from the poor south to the industrializing north provided the factories with labor at a competitive price			1
but then old demons came back to haunt @entity4			1
the sharp polarization , combined with fear , between left and right that was a legacy of the fascist period of @entity93 from 1917 to 1943 , returned first in the form of a huge wave of strikes in the late 1960s and early 1970s , and then in a deadly form of political violence			0
nearly 500 people died in shootings , bombings and other tragedies during the decade and a half from 1970 as extremists on both left and right fought a running battle			0
as well , sadly , as taking part in the violence , governments responded by trying to buy social peace -- first by implementing a very restrictive labor law which had the effect of making the law courts the principal arbitrator in industrial disputes ; and second by an explosion of public spending ( and thus borrowing ) chiefly on pensions and a national health system			1
public pensions became the main form of unemployment insurance , as unwanted workers were permitted to retire early and draw pensions			1
but public debt became the main albatross around @entity4 's neck as governments ran budget deficits that in 1975 - 95 averaged ( yes , averaged ) almost 10 % of gdp each and every year			1
the result : a pioneering crisis of sovereign debt and a foretaste of the crises now roiling the eurozone , as @entity4 's debt load reached 120 % of gdp in the early 1990s and sent the country into near bankruptcy			1
that financial crisis , in the course of which the @entity26 lira was ejected from @entity66 's pre-euro exchange - rate system ( along with @entity143 's pound sterling ) coincided with a huge political crisis , as corruption investigations brought crashing down the parties that had dominated @entity26 politics for the past 40 years			1
the crisis brought talk of a new start , a " second republic " ( to succeed the first , formed with the postwar constitution in 1945 - 48 ) and even a renaissance			0
in the interim , governments led by so - called technocrats ( a professor , a governor of the @entity159 , an ex-diplomat ) were brought in to make reforms and give the country a much needed " reset " before normal politics would be resumed			2
hence , 20 years later , @entity4 finds itself in yet another crisis , one that looks eerily similar			2
the country 's sovereign debt is -- you guessed it -- 120 % of gdp			1
a mix of financial crisis and scandals brought down the long - running government of the media billionaire @entity173 , while also discrediting establishment politicians of all parties			0
in november 2011 a technocrat , the economics professor and former @entity66 commissioner @entity177 , was brought in to stabilize the country 's finances , make reforms and give the country a " reset " before normal politics commence again after the upcoming elections			1
it is too soon to say that the " reset " -- or , to use a broader metaphor , the upgrading of @entity4 's cultural , political and economic software -- will fail again			1
but it can be said that progress has been slow and disappointing			0
prime minister @entity177 succeeded in stabilizing the public finances , but at the cost of a deeper recession than in all other eurozone economies except @entity195 and @entity196			2
beyond that , however , no major reforms have been implemented -- so the justice system remains painfully slow , the labor laws still discourage hiring while leaving millions of young people on poorly paid temporary contracts , competition remains overly restricted , too many markets are over-regulated , meritocracy remains stunted , corruption remains rife , and the huge cost of politics and political privileges has been left unchanged			2
these tasks all remain for whichever coalition succeeds in forming a government after the elections			0
they should , however , have been done during the previous 20 years			0
some progress in liberalizing markets was made , but not enough to stop @entity4 's gdp growth rate during 2001 - 10 from being the 180th worst in the world , just ahead of @entity219 's			1
why not ? resistance from entrenched interest groups has been strong			0
@entity173 's entry into politics in 1994 was essentially designed to obstruct change , to preserve his quasi-monopolistic businesses , and to ensure the old political ways could continue			2
on the left , suspicion of capitalism has remained rife , trade union powers have been maintained more successfully than in @entity230 or even @entity231 , and the use of political patronage to build power networks and reward supporters has helped destroy meritocracy			0
the big question , however , is why @entity26 have allowed this to happen			0
the answer in our film , " @entity24 " , is taken from @entity4 's , and arguably @entity66 's , greatest ever poet : @entity243			1
in his " @entity245 " of the 14th century , the sin he condemned most vigorously was " ignavia , " by which he meant sloth -- the failure to take responsibility , the failure to show moral courage and to change things			2
that is the coma that filmmaker @entity25 and i diagnose as the @entity26 condition : economic stagnation , yes , but also a failure of consciousness and responsibility , which is in effect a moral failure			2
@entity261 , the philosopher and novelist , adds a further explanation in the film			0
@entity26 , he says , " do not have a sense of the state			0
" they had and respected a very powerful state in @entity268 but that collapsed			0
the only states that have successfully replaced it since then have been the city states of @entity12 , @entity273 and elsewhere , which produced great riches and even the @entity275 of art , science , humanism and culture of the 15th century , but never achieved a set of stable , respected , still-less national institutions			0
to get @entity4 out of its coma , its second crisis of 20 years , new governments will have to work hard to fix that problem			1
to make sure they do so , @entity26 will need to shed their ignavia and to become more active and demanding -- not in their sectional or local interests , but in the national interest .			0

@entity291 : " @entity22 and @entity4 " represent spit personalities of troubled country
in 1950s , @entity4 was @entity66 's " emerging economy " and a pioneering center for design
old demons , *including* corruption and bloated public pensions , nearly bankrupted @entity4
today @entity4 's biggest problem is the country 's *refusal* to take responsibility and change
