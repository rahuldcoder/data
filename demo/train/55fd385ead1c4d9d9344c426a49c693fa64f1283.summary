-- about one out of every four @entity2 users lies on their profile , and not just to impress that guy or gal who would n't date them in high school			1
sometimes , it 's about privacy			0
that was one of the findings of a @entity14 investigation released this week			0
titled " @entity2 & your privacy , " the report focuses on the ways people use the social - networking site to share information , and what happens to that information after they do			1
in a survey of 2,000 households , 25 % of users said they falsified information in their profiles to protect their identity , @entity14 said			1
that 's up from 10 % in a similar survey two years ago			2
the consumer - advocacy site attributed that rise to growing concerns about privacy			0

there are some limits to a person 's ability to prevaricate on the site			2
@entity2 has a real - name policy			1
it requires a real e-mail address ( yes , you can create a dummy account that you only use to sign up for websites , but it 's still yours )			1
and you ca n't join certain networks -- those for college students , for example -- without the right kind of address			0
