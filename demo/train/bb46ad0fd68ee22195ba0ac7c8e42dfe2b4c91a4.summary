-- after the craziness of the winter weather , it 's time for some positive predictions , right ? meteorologists are on the lookout for a weather pattern that could mean a milder hurricane season for the @entity9 this summer			1
the @entity10 said thursday that there 's about a 50 % chance of a weather phenomenon called @entity14 developing this summer or fall			1
that 's not a guarantee , but conditions are favorable enough in the next six months to warrant an " @entity18			0
" an @entity14 event occurs about once every three to seven years , said @entity20 , senior scientist at the @entity21			1
it involves the warming of the central and eastern @entity24 , and results in major changes in the jet stream where storms track			0
as the ocean builds up heat in the western @entity24 , some of the heat goes into the atmosphere through evaporation			2
the moistened atmosphere invigorates storms , @entity20 said , changing where hurricanes and typhoons occur			0
but those of you on the @entity43 @entity9 and @entity44 , rejoice : " it means that the @entity47 hurricane season will be rather weak because it ca n't stand the competition , " @entity20 said			0
an @entity14 event would likely mean more shear -- wind speeds that increase with height -- in the upper levels of the atmosphere during hurricane season			1
this wind shear would suppress the development of tropical systems			0
@entity59 would also benefit if @entity14 conditions develop and continue into the winter			1
the state is suffering from one of the worst droughts in its history			0
an @entity14 pattern in the winter time usually results in much wetter conditions for the @entity70			1
because @entity14 warms up the atmosphere as a whole , we may see a mini global warming phenomenon , @entity20 said			1
places that shivered through a deep freeze this year may see above - average temperatures next winter , if the pattern continues , @entity20 said			1
but in other parts of the world , @entity14 can be quite disruptive , depending on where you live			2
monsoons in @entity83 and droughts in @entity85 may result , @entity20 said			0
@entity86 would be more likely to see a hurricane			0
flooding in @entity88 and @entity89 are also associated with @entity14			2
farmers there have switched from cotton to rice farming to adapt during such times , @entity20 said			0
in february , sea surface temperatures were below average in the eastern equatorial @entity24 , but above average near the @entity98 , @entity10 said			2
there were also strong low - level westerly winds reappearing over the @entity101 , which could help to hold onto the increased heat content in the central and east - central equatorial @entity101			0
right now the @entity14 is in its " neutral " phase -- neither warm nor cool -- but models suggest that @entity14 could develop			2
the last record - breaking @entity14 event was in 1997 to 1998			1
the pattern led to a relatively warm winter , but also a series of devastating weather events : flooding in the @entity110 and @entity59 , an ice storm in the northeast and tornadoes in @entity114			1
" be careful what you wish for sometimes , " @entity20 said .			0

@entity10 : 50 % of @entity14 this summer or fall
the pattern would mean warmer atmosphere
@entity59 could get a relief from drought
record - breaking @entity14 was 1997 to 1998
