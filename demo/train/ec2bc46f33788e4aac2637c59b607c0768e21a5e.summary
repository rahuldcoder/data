@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity0 warehouse is bustling with activity : forklifts buzzing across the floor			1
boxes stacked neatly by the loading area			2
@entity9 lined side by side to take deliveries			2
ceo @entity12 shows it all off with a clear sense of pride and accomplishment			2
he just wishes he was n't so busy			2
yes , a ceo who wishes supply outpaced demand			0
" we have had a steady increase in the number of people who seek emergency food assistance , " @entity12 tells a visitor			0
it is impossible not to be impressed by the operation			0
@entity12 is president and ceo of the @entity28 , which now operates out of what once was a beer distributorship			2
it is also impossible not to be numbed by the numbers : more than 2 million people in @entity1 -- 18 % of the state population -- face what the government terms food insecurity			1
that means they go hungry or are not able to maintain normal and consistent eating patterns because they cant afford it			0
poll : @entity42 leads in @entity1 , swing states , tops 50 % the @entity0 - @entity45 facility serves eight counties and reaches about 180,000 people			1
strikingly , about 45 % of those who get help do n't qualify for government assistance because they work and do n't meet government income guidelines , but they still do n't make enough money to make ends meet			0
@entity0 is in @entity1 's @entity56 , a blue - collar battleground within perhaps the 2012 campaign 's defining battleground state			1
the experience of the food bank -- and the charities it helps -- mirror the campaign economic debate : are things better off than they were when president @entity42 took office in 2009 ? flowers said demand at the food bank is higher than ever , which could be seen as evidence that things have not gotten better in this swing state			1
but , one could look at it this way : back in 2008 and 2009 , demand grew 25 % from year to year			2
this year it is up 3 % from last year			2
" it is almost a sad fact that that feels like a win -- that it is not so bad , " @entity12 told @entity2 during a visit on tuesday -- just 98 days , or 14 weeks , until the november election			0
@entity42 is returning to the area wednesday -- his ninth campaign visit to @entity1 this year -- and his team can make a statistical case that the state is in better shape			1
in @entity56 , for example , the unemployment rate is 7 % -- down from 9.3 % when the president took office			2
@entity90 argue @entity92 gov. @entity91 deserves credit more than the @entity95 president , but their bigger push is to make the case the recovery would be stronger if not for an administration they say stifles job creation with regulation and new mandates like the @entity42 health care law			1
" the president 's not only demonstrated that he tends toward more of a government - oriented solution toward the economy , but gov. @entity106 has proven firsthand he knows how to create jobs , " state sen. @entity103 told @entity2 during a visit to a @entity106 campaign @entity56 office in @entity108 , where a dozen @entity92 volunteers were making voter calls			1
the strategy of the swing states @entity1 is a fascinating county - by - county chess game			1
republicans do n't expect to carry @entity56 , for example , but @entity106 wo n't have a prayer statewide unless he improves on sen. @entity123 's weak 41 % performance here in 2008			0
with so much tv ad money being spent here , @entity103 argues there will be a " saturation point , " and that @entity1 in the end will be decided on the strength of grassroots organizing			1
" in ' 08 , that enthusiasm was n't there as much as it could have been , " @entity103 said			0
" i get calls all the time from people that say , ' what can i do to help @entity106 win ? ' " and what does he say to those turned off by the already nasty campaign ? " i tell them that 's like saying , ' i do n't get involved in the weather			0
' it 's going to effect you			0
" the president 's recent " you did n't build it " remark that the @entity106 campaign characterizes as an insult to entrepreneurs and small businesses plays heavily in the @entity92 strategy now			2
@entity154 : ' @entity42 is all foam and no beer ' @entity1 is full of small towns and medium - sized cities -- like @entity0 and @entity159 -- where @entity106 and his surrogates make the case that remark , and the @entity42 record , prove the president sees government as a stronger force than the private sector			1
most republicans here push for @entity92 sen. @entity170 to share the ticket with @entity106			0
but former @entity172 gov. @entity154 had an @entity1 audition of sorts while the candidate was overseas this week			1
at the @entity176 in @entity159 , @entity154 drew laughter when he asked patrons how they would feel if the owner promised a cold beer then served them a glass of foam , and then added : " president @entity42 is all foam and no beer			1
" turning more serious , he said government was choking business expansion with regulation while also running up huge deficits			0
" the hour is later than people realize , " @entity154 said			0
@entity159 is another critical piece of the puzzle -- and another area @entity194 can cite some progress			0
unemployment was 11.1 % in the county in february 2009 ; it is 8.1 % now			2
county by county analysis again , @entity201 -- home of @entity159 -- is a key test of @entity106 's @entity1 viability			1
president @entity205 essentially split the vote with @entity95 challenger @entity207 here in 2004 - the @entity204 had a slight 51 % to 49 % edge			2
@entity42 , on the other hand , beat @entity123 53 % to 46 % here -- one of the many swing counties key to the big @entity95 2008 @entity1 edge			1
@entity214 -- the @entity215 area -- was the surprise piece of @entity42 's 2008 @entity1 rout			1
look at a 2008 map and it is shaded blue -- carried by @entity42			1
look at the close 2000 and 2004 races , when @entity1 was carried both times by @entity205 , and @entity214 is shaded red for @entity90			1
" i think @entity214 is the key to winning @entity1 , and winning @entity1 is the key to the president 's re-election , " the county @entity95 chairman @entity222 said in an interview at his @entity215 law office			1
@entity232 - @entity231 turnout was critical to @entity42 's @entity214 win four years ago , and @entity222 says the campaign and state party are increasing field staff and other resources to prove wrong those who believe that turnout among that voting bloc will slip some this year			1
he also predicted @entity91 's clashes with organized labor will benefit the president in november			2
" some of the more conservative unions -- like the police and fire unions -- which have trended toward the @entity90 , they 're back in the @entity95 camp , and they 're going to be there in the fall , " @entity222 said			0
@entity252 rate , auto industry improving in @entity222 's view , recent improvement in @entity1 's jobless numbers will make it harder for @entity106 and the @entity92 to win the " are you better off ? " debate in this state			1
" just take the auto industry and how that has seen a resurgence in the state of @entity1 , " @entity222 said			1
" we 've got three quarters of a million jobs that are auto related here in @entity1 , and we are seeing the benefits of that for president @entity42			1
" some , though , have a different test than the unemployment rate			0
@entity274 is at the @entity0 food bank four or five days a week for five years now , packing his wife 's minivan with supplies for the @entity280 charity			0
five years watching the changing face of hunger and struggle -- watching economic anxiety spread to folks who had never experienced chronic unemployment or hunger			0
" i think it is worse than three years ago , " @entity274 says			0
... i 'd say we are going into the middle of the middle class now			0
we are reaching up to the suburban people			0
to people who used to have a nice home , a nice car			0
... it is worse than it was three years ago			0
" better or worse : the defining question in what could well be the defining battleground .			0

economy is improving , but many still not better off in @entity1
president @entity42 makes his ninth trip to @entity1 this year
race for @entity310 will be fought on the county level
