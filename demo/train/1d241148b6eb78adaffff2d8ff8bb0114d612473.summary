-- president @entity2 's rebuke of republicans who are " beating the drums of war " in encouraging the @entity6 to take military action against @entity8 should be targeted not just toward those critics but also , and more important , toward the @entity11 government			1
an attack on @entity8 would not only fail to achieve its stated goal of denuclearizing the country , it would unleash a devastating confrontation between @entity8 and @entity11 that would harm thousands of @entity11 and @entity8 , and affect those in neighboring states			1
it would drag the @entity6 into another @entity20 quagmire , and it would launch an oil crisis that would throw the global economy into turmoil			0
then , once the dust settles ( or before it does ) , @entity8 would only be more motivated to pursue its nuclear ambition			0
four scenarios on @entity8 's nuclear plan in the current environment of heated rhetoric from all sides , there is too much focus on when and if @entity11 would launch a preemptive strike against @entity8			1
what 's missing in the talks are the chance of success in stopping @entity8 's nuclear plan through a military option and the regional and global consequences of a new war			1
given the territorial distribution of @entity8 's nuclear facilities and the likelihood that @entity8 has readied them for possible attacks , @entity11 probably does not have the military capacity to eliminate , or even seriously damage , @entity8 's alleged nuclear program			1
some experts have compared @entity11 's airstrikes against nuclear facilities in @entity51 in 1981 and @entity52 in 2007 with a possible strike against @entity8			1
but this is a flawed analogy			0
in those cases , @entity11 launched surprise attacks against one facility , which would not be the case with @entity8			1
moreover , @entity8 and @entity11 both possess extensive arsenals of missiles			1
there is little doubt that a strike would trigger an unprecedented war in the @entity20			2
@entity11 would be far more vulnerable in such a war than @entity8 , due to its small size and the fact that the country 's epicenter is in one single region , the greater @entity73 area			1
although @entity8 has come under immense international pressure to halt its nuclear plan , it has refused to do so			0
however , @entity8 , unlike its reputation in the @entity77 and in @entity11 in particular , is a rational country with rational leadership , which seeks to enhance its regional and global power			2
therefore , comparing @entity8 with @entity81 , as is often done by @entity11 leadership , is historically problematic and extremely dangerous politically			2
unfortunately , given the track record of engaging with @entity8 , perhaps in the long term we may have to learn to live with a nuclearized @entity20 that would operate based on the @entity86 dynamics of mutually assured destruction			2
a nuclearized @entity8 might even launch a nuclear arms race involving other regional players such as @entity90 and @entity91			0
the only alternative to this pessimistic forecast is to reconsider @entity20 inter-state politics , the @entity96 - @entity11 conflict and @entity6 policy in the region			1
constructive communication should be encouraged between the @entity8 leadership and the @entity6 , and it should involve other key players			0
the @entity6 should acknowledge the importance of having strong regional players in the @entity20 , including @entity8			2
if the regional inter-state dynamics can be changed for the better , @entity8 may be forced to rethink its strategy , including its nuclear ambition			0
a rebalanced @entity20 will also need the @entity11 - @entity108 conflict to be resolved sooner rather than later , since that has been a source of continuous friction			0
regrettably , with @entity11 , @entity8 and the @entity6 entrenched in their positions , it does not look like we are heading in a direction that would solve the @entity8 problem anytime soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			0

president @entity2 said the @entity124 are " beating the drums of war " about attacking @entity8
@entity119 : a military strike against @entity8 would unleash a devastating war
he says @entity11 would be far more vulnerable in such a war than @entity8
@entity132 : we should consider how to rebalance @entity20 inter-state politics
