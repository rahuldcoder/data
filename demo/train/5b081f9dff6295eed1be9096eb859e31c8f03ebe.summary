-- one of @entity4 's most influential figures in @entity5 has been killed by @entity7 and @entity8 forces , a @entity2 official said friday			1
@entity7 military sources had earlier said that @entity10 , a deputy leader of @entity11 , was killed in an airstrike in @entity13 late last month			1
@entity10 was one of the group 's most ruthless commanders , having seized at least a dozen foreigners for ransom			2
at least two have been killed ; several @entity7 citizens remain captive			1
" he was a senior influential member of @entity11 , and his death represents a significant blow to @entity11 's efforts to use @entity23 , and @entity13 in particular , as a safe haven , " the official told @entity0			1
military sources quoted by @entity7 media say that in the past few days , @entity10 and a substantial number of his fighters were killed during a @entity7 bombardment near @entity31 in northern @entity13			1
his death was first reported by an @entity33 television station @entity34			0
a spokesman for the @entity36 refused to comment on the reports			0
the ministry did say air force operations are continuing , including in the @entity41 region , where close to 100 air sorties were carried out this week			0
@entity31 is a remote town close to mountains and the @entity33 border -- in a region where many @entity48 fighters had regrouped in the face of the @entity7 push toward the main cities of the north			1
according to analysts , it is an area that @entity10 was intimately familiar with , as for years it was his main base of operations before @entity57 took over much of northern @entity13			1
for much of the last year , a constellation of jihadist forces including @entity10 had controlled large parts of northern @entity13 after ethnic @entity62 rebels had forced the army to retreat			1
he spent much of his time in and around @entity65 , partly at a luxurious mansion that had been built for @entity67 , according to reports from the city			0
at the beginning of this year , @entity10 joined other @entity48 forces making a push southward toward the capital , @entity74			2
but when the @entity48 advances prompted a @entity7 intervention , he moved to the area around the less accessible city of @entity79 , close to the virtually impenetrable @entity80			2
@entity10 had been promoted by the emir of @entity11 -- and fellow @entity33 -- @entity82			1
@entity82 saw him as a loyal counter to the growing power of a rival jihadist commander , @entity85 , the man who ordered the hostage attack on the @entity33 gas plant in january			0
@entity10 's ruthlessness -- and his growing influence -- were confirmed three years ago when he ordered the beheading of an elderly @entity92 tourist -- @entity93 -- who 'd been seized by his group early in 2009			2
when @entity13 authorities rounded up a number of @entity4 suspects in response , @entity10 sent a hit squad to the @entity65 home of a senior intelligence officer , who was shot dead			1
the following year , a @entity7 aid worker , 78 - year old @entity102 , was killed as @entity7 commandos tried to rescue him			1
@entity10 's group also staged a raid on a uranium mine in neighboring @entity107 -- abducting seven workers , four of whom , all @entity7 , are still being held			1
one of the few westerners to have encountered @entity10 was a @entity7 citizen , @entity110 , who was abducted from a hotel in northern @entity13 in november 2009			1
" physically , there is nothing remarkable about @entity10 , " he told @entity113 's @entity112 after his release			2
" he is small , and thin			0
but he seems to be highly respected by members of his entourage			0
" " he wanted to know whether i knew of any mapping websites on the @entity121 , @entity123 websites , so that he could have real - time images			0
" @entity10 's hostage - taking provoked a trial of strength with @entity85 , who had generated significant funds for jihad from ransom payments for foreign hostages			2
by all accounts , the two were very different characters			0
@entity10 had a reputation for extreme brutality and thuggishness , while @entity85 developed a reputation for strategic cunning			1
analysts tell @entity0 that despite their rivarly , the two men found ways to coexist			0
the fall of @entity67 in @entity145 gave both men the opportunity to take their operations northward into @entity145 from their @entity150 strongholds			0
sources briefed by @entity153 intelligence told @entity0 that @entity85 and @entity10 made trips to @entity145 to explore the possibility of cooperation with local @entity145 jihadist groups , secure weapons supplies and scout out possible locations for training facilities			2
@entity10 made several trips to @entity145 in 2011 , according to one source familiar with intelligence from the area			2
he was one of several @entity4 figures in @entity5 who had fought in @entity33 's vicious insurgency in the 1990s , when whole villages were massacred and atrocities were committed by both @entity48 militants and @entity33 's counterterrorism forces			0
as a child growing up in a poor region of southern @entity33 , @entity10 had little formal schooling , but his intimate knowledge of the border with @entity145 made him an expert smuggler			0
according to @entity180 , writing in the @entity179 's @entity178 , he was radicalized by several run - ins with the @entity33 authorities			0
and he was at the heart of the transformation of the @entity33 insurgency into an @entity4 affiliate			0
@entity10 's death casts further uncertainty over the fate of the @entity7 hostages his group is still believed to hold			1
in december , before the @entity7 intervention in @entity13 , he accused the @entity7 authorities of blocking negotiations for their safe release			1
several of the hostages had appeared in videos warning against military intervention for the sake of their own safety			0
in one video , with masked men holding @entity204 behind them , the men look exhausted and terrified			0
@entity206 , a @entity207 - based analyst who recently traveled to @entity13 , told @entity0 there is concern that @entity10 transported a number of @entity153 hostages with him after he left @entity65			1
if @entity10 was indeed killed , the expectation is his group will retaliate			2
" according to available accounts , he was somebody who generated fierce respect and loyalty in his men , so unless his fighting force has been severely degraded , there 's a chance his group may lash out to avenge his death in the days and weeks ahead , " @entity206 said .			0
