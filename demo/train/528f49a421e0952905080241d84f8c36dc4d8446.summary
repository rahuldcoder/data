@entity0 -- additional information received recently by a @entity4 watchdog group raises new concerns about the intent of @entity8 's nuclear program			1
" based on the agency 's analysis of additional information which has come to its attention since august 2008 , including new information recently received , there are further concerns which the agency also needs to clarify with @entity8 , " the confidential report by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) stated in a section about a potential military dimension to the program			1
the report , obtained friday , does not elaborate on the new information			0
however , it does discuss possible nuclear activities tied to @entity8 's military " including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile			2
" the @entity10 assessment appears to be in sync with a new @entity33 intelligence community report			1
according to a @entity33 official , the @entity34 concludes that @entity8 has resumed research on building a warhead			1
the official , who is familiar with the report but is not authorized to speak for attribution about the sensitive document , said there is no indication @entity8 is manufacturing any components , but " research on weaponization is moving forward			1
" the new @entity34 updates a controversial assessment in 2007 , which indicated @entity8 had stopped work on its weaponization program in 2003			1
many western intelligence services disagreed with the @entity33 conclusion at the time			2
at a recent @entity55 hearing , director of national intelligence @entity52 appeared to allude to the latest assessment , telling senators that @entity8 " continues to advance its uranium enrichment capabilities along with what appears to be the scientific , technical and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons if its leaders choose to do so			1
" @entity8 claims its uranium enrichment program is intended for civilian energy purposes , however the @entity33 and others maintain @entity8 is seeking to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons			1
the new @entity10 report indicates that @entity8 is continuing to enrich uranium despite a @entity4 prohibition			2
former nuclear weapons inspector @entity73 said he would have expected the enrichment rate to be higher based on earlier performance			0
he said the @entity8 might be having ongoing problems with centrifuges , some of which could be after - effects of the @entity83 computer worm that reportedly infected the system last year			0
@entity8 continues to use the less sophisticated @entity86 centrifuge machines			0
but according to the report , @entity8 has notified the @entity10 of its intentions to install two new 164 centrifuge cascades comprised of @entity90 and @entity92 centrifuges			2
@entity93 , the president of the @entity94 , says the more advanced machines should significantly increase the production of enriched uranium at a lower failure rate			0
the @entity10 chastised @entity8 for its continued stonewalling of the agency			0
" @entity8 is not providing the necessary cooperation to enable the agency to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in @entity8 , and therefore to conclude that all nuclear materials in @entity8 is in peaceful activities , " the report said			0
@entity93 noted a tonal shift in the latest assessment			0
" the @entity10 seems to be running out of patience with @entity8 , " said @entity93 , adding , " this could lead to more sanctions " against @entity8 by the international community .			0
