-- when celebrating an important anniversary , it 's always good to look your best			2
at least that 's the theory behind the latest kit for @entity7 cultural y @entity6 , whose players donned a somewhat special uniform for a preseason tournament wednesday			0
a cross between formal evening - wear and a sporting outfit , the tuxedo-esque strip was specially designed by @entity17 firm @entity15 to celebrate the third division side 's 90th birthday			1
the club will give 10 % of the proceeds to charities for mining families based in the region of @entity25 where it is based , while local children will also receive free football kits and coaching classes			1
fan reaction has been mixed since last week 's preview , says @entity15 's marketing manager @entity32 , but the jersey has garnered worldwide attention for a team which has only once graced @entity37 's top flight -- back in the 1955 - 56 season			2
" the club wanted to help the mining industry in the region , which is having some really tough times , " @entity32 told @entity0			0
" we wanted to go in and explore the club 's heritage and find what has local character , and incorporate that into the design			0
" the club is celebrating its 90 - year anniversary , so instead of having a formal reception with wine and drinks and snacks the club decided to do something ... another way with a bit of character			2
" the concept of designing a special - edition football kit to carry a special message is far from a new one -- especially in @entity37			1
in 2000 , @entity64 released a shirt that featured the name of every season ticket - holder at the club to show solidarity between the then top - flight team and its fans			0
second division club @entity72 , meanwhile , has released two special - edition kits for the coming preseason that take the appearance of a glass of beer and an octopus -- two delicacies of the @entity82 region in northwest @entity37 where the side is based			1
@entity84 has played the last two @entity86 seasons in a broccoli - style shirt which is said to represent the southern @entity81 's reputation for growing vegetables			0
even some of @entity37 's most famous clubs , like @entity92 and @entity93 , have gotten in on the act			1
last season @entity92 's away kit was based on the @entity101 flag , while @entity93 's 2011 - 12 away strip reflected the @entity104 flag and a few years earlier its " spilled blood " shirt was designed by a local artist whose work features in the city 's @entity97			1
