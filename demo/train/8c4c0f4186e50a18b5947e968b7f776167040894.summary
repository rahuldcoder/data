opening statements in the trial of actress @entity3 's claim that her " @entity5 " character was killed off because she complained about mistreatment by the tv show 's creator were delayed wednesday morning as the judge considered an evidence dispute			1
@entity12 judge @entity11 tossed reporters from the courtroom while she heard arguments over whether the jury should hear conversations that may have been protected by attorney - client privilege			0
once lawyers deliver their openings to the jury , @entity3 is expected to testify in her wrongful termination lawsuit against series creator - producer - writer @entity23 and @entity24			1
several of @entity3 's former cast mates -- including @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend @entity23			1
the suit contends that @entity23 created " a hostile work environment " from the show 's beginning in 2004			2
" @entity23 has a reputation for behaving in an extremely abusive and aggressive manner toward the individuals who work on the show , and is known for regularly demeaning the writers and staff in front of others on the show , including @entity3 , " the suit says			2
@entity23 focused his hostility on @entity3 in the fifth season when " @entity23 consistently behaved in a dismissive , demeaning and unprofessional manner toward @entity3 , not only in front of the other cast and crew on the show , but before the public at large , " it says			2
this " hostility and aggression toward @entity3 culminated " on the set of the show on september 24 , 2008 , the suit says			0
the suit alleges that " during a rehearsal for the show , when @entity3 questioned @entity23 about something that was in the script , @entity23 took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head			1
" @entity3 complained to @entity24 executives about the september 2008 incident , but " nevertheless , @entity23 's abusive and aggressive behavior towards @entity3 not only persisted , it worsened , " the suit contends			1
" he continued to behave in a derisive and condescending manner toward @entity3			0
" @entity71 episodes later , in march 2009 , her character , @entity70 , was electrocuted after a car crash , ending @entity3 's employment on the series			2
defense lawyers argue that @entity23 " lightly tapped her head in giving her direction for a scene , " and " the decision that the character of @entity70 would die was made before the incident and was primarily a creative decision			1
" @entity3 's lawyers contend it is " exceptionally unusual for a popular character to be killed off or written out of a television series unless the actor has requested to be released from his or her contract			0
" @entity3 lost at least $ 20 million by missing out on the last three seasons , the suit says			0
her pay was to be $ 250,000 for each episode in the eighth year , which is the final season for the series , it said			0
lawyers estimated in court filings that testimony in the trial could last more than two weeks .			0
