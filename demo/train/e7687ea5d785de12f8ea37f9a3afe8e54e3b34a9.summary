-- " the working title , as of right now , is ' @entity12 , ' " @entity1 , the singer - songwriter - leader of @entity2 , says of his band 's eighth studio album , now in the mixing stage at the group 's @entity7 studio , the loft , and due for release in september			1
" if i could say anything to the world at large , that would be it			2
" the record will be @entity2 's first on their own label , @entity19 -- shorthand for decibels per minute -- and @entity1 's third set of new songs with his longest - running lineup : bassist @entity24 , guitarist @entity25 , drummer @entity26 , keyboard player @entity27 and multi-instrumentalist @entity28			1
the group has recorded more than 20 songs , @entity1 says , " out of the things i had coming in , which was somewhere in the fifties and sixties			1
it 's a pretty great time for me writing-wise			2
" after @entity2 finished touring last year , " we took a little more time off the road than we normally do , " says @entity1			1
" certainly , it 's been the longest break i 've had since my twenties , and that 's been a big help , wading out that far from the comfort of the old songs			0
you have to keep your mind sharp to play your old songs			0
it 's hard to allow yourself to freely think about what you want to do next , when you 're that close to doing another show			0
" the album includes a seven - minute track , " @entity53 , " which starts with shadowy electronics , gently turns into a haunted vocal section , then sprints into a @entity56 - style blowout			1
there are also two country - flavored songs , the spectral ballad " @entity60 " and the jauntier " @entity61			2
" " there are two strong threads of material , " @entity1 says , " one being a little weirder -- snot - nosed obnoxious pop songs -- and the other more languid , atmospheric - country music			1
" " @entity61 " grew out of " a chord progression i found interesting , " he notes			0
but the arrangements are the product " of six guys being pretty remarkable at communicating without talking and having a lot of trust in each other			0
" @entity1 points out that the name of @entity2 's label -- to be distributed by @entity76 -- was originally a working title for the 2004 album , " a ghost is born			1
" " it does n't make any sense , " he admits			0
" but as a graphic , it looks cool			0
