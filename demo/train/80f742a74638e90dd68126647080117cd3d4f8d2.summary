-- when it comes to facial hair , there are few more passionate advocates than @entity5			1
as the " founder and self - appointed captain " of @entity9 , he was responsible for bringing the sport of competitive bearding to the @entity12 in 2003			1
since then , things have , well , grown			1
" it really is quite amazing , " @entity14 said from his home in @entity17			1
" interest in bearding worldwide has taken off			1
" you see more and more facial hair everywhere you look , and every time , it feels like a little victory for me			2
men are finally liberating themselves			2
" the weird world of ' competitive bearding ' @entity14 is one of the " bearders " behind the @entity29 and @entity30 , which took place in @entity32 , @entity33 , this weekend			1
hundreds competed in categories including " full beard natural , " " full beard styled mustache , " " imperial " and " freestyle			1
" @entity40 's most frustrating objects " men are competitive			2
it 's in our very nature , " @entity14 said this month			2
" so why should n't we compete over our beards ? it is our uniquely masculine quality , the one thing we can do that most women ca n't			2
" the scale of this event is emblematic of the huge resurgence in beard cultivation over recent years			1
for @entity14 -- who himself sports a 12 - inch sculpted wookiee of a thing -- this burgeoning masculine hairiness is driven by sexual politics			2
" for centuries , men have been pressured by women to scrape their faces daily so that they would look more like women , " he says			2
" finally , we have come around to realizing that we should express our masculinity in the natural way , by growing a beard			1
" so how does he feel about men who shave ? " i do n't despise the clean - shaven , " he said magnanimously			2
" i just feel sorry for them , because they 're not experiencing the majesty of realizing one 's full masculine potential			2
" as for the stubble people , they still have to go through the almost daily humiliation of keeping it at stubble length			2
but at least they 've taken the first step and are not completely emasculating themselves			2
" the beard as social statement this militant pogonophilia may seem rather extreme			1
but according to @entity87 , the @entity88 - based author of " one thousand beards : a @entity92 , " the beard has always been a powerful , and often controversial , social symbol			1
what we can learn from the tattoos of our ancestors " it 's only recently that men had a choice about their facial hair , " he said			2
" in the @entity105 period , certain beards or sideburns were the badge of a gentleman or maybe a sportsman			2
it was a known quantity			2
" in earlier periods , the climate was even more severe			0
@entity113 banned the beard so that it would not be grabbed in combat ; several rulers , including @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , enforced a " beard tax , " making it a rigid indicator of affluence and social status ( in early 18th - century @entity124 , bearded men had to carry a " beard token " to prove they had paid up )			1
" traditionally , men have taken their grooming cues from authority figures , such as the king , politicians or clergymen , " @entity87 said			0
" we were told by authority figures what it is to be a man , what that should look like			0
" there were lots of arbitrary declarations about facial hair , saying it is sinful , or virtuous or whatever			0
" it was always for reasons of control			0
men wore their allegiance , and an indication of their class , on their faces			0
" in many parts of the world , this is still the case			0
the beard is of vital importance in most @entity156 societies , for example , and in @entity161 , the size and twirl of a mustache shows one 's political affiliations			1
how facial hair can be used to rebel for these reasons , facial hair , or the lack of it , can traditionally also signify subversion			0
the whiskys selling for six figures " @entity172 was clean - shaven when all his contemporaries had a big @entity105 beard , " @entity87 said			1
" just by doing the opposite , you make a statement			0
these days , having a beard is a bit rebellious because it departs from convention			1
" in the postwar period , the military requirement to shave denoted respectability			0
then came the @entity185 and the @entity186 and the @entity188 mustache of the ' 70s , followed by ' 80s designer stubble and the ' 90s grunge - style goatee			0
" then all hell broke loose , " @entity87 said			0
" in this postmodern period , anything goes , from trim professional beards to hipster madness			0
" men in the @entity198 are freer to do whatever they want and keep their jobs , which was just not the case for our fathers and grandfathers			0
we can express ourselves in all kinds of ways and grow our facial hair in more ways than ever before			0
" these days , many men grow a beard to reflect transition in their lives , such as a change of career or divorce			1
@entity216 , for instance , grew a beard after he lost the presidential election in 2000			1
by doing this he was changing his public face , demonstrating that he was becoming an academic where beards are welcome			0
how does a beard change how you are perceived ? but despite the increasingly hirsute - tolerant atmosphere , studies have demonstrated that having a beard dramatically alters how you are perceived -- and not necessarily for the better			1
it has been argued that a bearded man appears more confident of his strength ( since a " grabbable " beard is a disadvantage in a fight ) and immune system ( @entity237 ) ( since a beard can encourage parasites , bed bugs and sand fleas )			1
he is also perceived to have a higher social status			1
a number of studies , however , have suggested that a beard makes a man appear more masculine and aggressive ; older ; and , generally speaking , less attractive to women			1
" wearing a beard is a bold statement , even today , " @entity87 said			1
" that 's why it evokes so much emotion			0
and it is why you so rarely see a politician or a banker with a beard			1
they ca n't afford to alienate a sizable portion of the population			0
" the strange world of toilet architecture @entity14 strenuously disagrees			0
" i 'm a lawyer , " he said , " and i 've never had a negative comment about my beard , not from any client , judge or opposing counsel			1
" it has not been a hindrance but an asset at work			0
it 's a distinction , something that helps people remember me			0
" it demonstrates someone who is willing to be an individual , to stick his neck out , to take a risk , to be bold			0
in many professions , that should increase one 's esteem within the community			0
" have we reached ' peak beard ' ? where now for the beard ? @entity87 believes that the nature of fashion is such that every peak will be followed by a trough , and we shall soon see a decline in the level of enthusiasm for facial hair			1
@entity14 , however , thinks the revolution is only beginning			0
" people need to realize that not all beards are created equal , " he said			0
" there is a beard to suit every face			1
they can be groomed , they can be cleaned , and they can be tamed			0
" as soon as people start to realize that having a beard is n't the same as not brushing your teeth or taking a shower and that there 's something for everybody , the sky 's the limit			1
" men need to break free			0
i would like to see the beard championships grow and eventually become on a par with the @entity321			1
" @entity323 's paradise : a sneak peek inside @entity326 's most prestigious private homes stunning ' time - slice ' photos capture your favorite landmarks from sunrise to sunset meet the surrealist behind fashion 's most memorable images			0
