here in @entity1 , you can tell that the @entity4 presidential election is only about 600 days away because every restaurant here seems to contain a senator or a governor			1
why do they come to @entity10 ? whatever their motivation , nine times out of 10 they wish they had n't			1
most recently , @entity16 gov. @entity15 visited @entity17 -- a gorgeous foreign policy study center in @entity19			1
there he was asked if he believed in evolution or not			1
why , i can not fathom			1
either way , @entity15 refused to answer , which probably seemed like a clever thing to do in the heat of the moment			1
but while an equivocation that might simply sound awkward in @entity4 , it sounded off - the - wall crazy in @entity1			1
why ? because for us it is like being casually asked " does two plus two equal four ? " and replying , " i 'd rather not answer a hypothetical question			1
" one does n't dodge an invitation to assert fact in the @entity10			1
@entity15 dodged , and because the audience laughed gently at him in @entity40 accents , it made him look all the more like a country bumpkin			2
@entity4 politicians have to stop doing this			1
go to @entity44 instead : there the applause lines are well scripted and all the audience expects to see you do is pray with moist eyes			2
in contrast , @entity40 is somewhere that @entity4 political careers go to end			1
we 're too judgmental , too passive aggressive , too weird			2
even we do n't like ourselves -- so i 've no idea why @entity4 fly here seeking a warm welcome			1
consider how horrible we were to @entity57			2
of course , from our point of view he was n't very nice to us either			2
in july 2012 , he showed up in @entity1 and began by casting doubt on our ability to host the @entity62 ( something we very much doubted , too , but were n't going to take criticisms from a foreigner )			1
then he appeared to forget the name of the leader of the opposition and called him " mr. leader " instead ( we 'd all like to forget his name , but sadly , it is etched on our memories thanks to his ineptitude )			2
finally , @entity57 said that it was curious to look out of the " backside of @entity75 " ( " backside " is @entity40 for " ass " )			2
for all of this , @entity1 mayor @entity78 taunted @entity57 in front of a large @entity10 crowd -- and @entity78 is the closest you get to a politician we actually like			1
so @entity57 's humiliation was a big deal			2
it 's all part of a pattern			2
politician comes to @entity10 , opens his mouth , says something foolish			0
@entity94 gov. @entity93 's remarks about vaccinations were probably a little too parochial to cause a stir in in the @entity10 media , but @entity99 gov. @entity98 's about @entity100 certainly did			0
speaking to the @entity101 -- a neoconservative @entity10 group who are fans of the late senator -- he revived the claim that there are " no - go " areas in the @entity10 as a result of @entity109 immigration			0
but while there certainly are no - go areas here , it 's because they 're just horrible and no one ( @entity100 , @entity115 , @entity116 or anyone else ) would want to go there			0
every nation has its @entity120 , but the idea that my country has become a patchwork of little caliphates is sheer fantasy			0
is there a political bias in all of this ? do @entity130 make particularly bad travelers ? not necessarily			0
partly what 's going on here is that there are far more @entity130 contenders than @entity137 ones , so it 's the conservative mistakes that get noticed the most			0
but there might also be some truth in the assertion that the @entity10 enjoy tripping @entity130 up more			0
why , otherwise , would someone ask @entity15 whether or not he believes in evolution when he 's in the @entity10 on a trade mission ? @entity146 or @entity147 would never be asked such a question			0
make no mistake , our largely left - wing media sees the @entity130 as a @entity153 clich√© of the old @entity154 -- so it 's no surprise that its candidates get all the strangest questions			1
but that , i would argue , is one more reason for @entity130 to cross @entity10 off their places to visit			1
another is our decline in importance			0
you see , we 're not nearly as superior as we like to make ourselves out to be			0
we 've cut our defense spending and chosen not to take part in half of the war against the @entity169 in @entity170 and @entity171			0
we contributed nothing towards the recent @entity174 ceasefire negotiations because we are , in the opinion of some , irrelevant			0
meanwhile , the decline of religion in this country is fast , but while we like to imagine it has brought enlightenment , the reality is probably that it has brought social dislocation and despair			0
our poor are so poor that they rely upon free food handouts			0
and our politics can be as frustrating and fractured as @entity4 's -- we have a buoyant far right to prove it			1
so my advice for any other presidential candidates considering a visit to @entity1 is to take a second look at the map			1
@entity197 is a better vision of conservative government			0
@entity200 runs @entity201 these days			0
and , of course , there 's a lot happening in @entity205 right now , too ...			0
