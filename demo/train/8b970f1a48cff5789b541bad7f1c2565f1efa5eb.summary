-- a fourth man has pleaded guilty to a federal hate crime in the death of a black man who was beaten by a gang of young whites , then run over by a pickup truck driven by one of them in @entity10 in 2011			1
in a separate but related case , another @entity10 man admitted he was part of a group of whites who carried out other racial attacks against african - americans around the same time			1
@entity18 , 23 , from @entity19 , @entity10 , pleaded guilty tuesday to federal hate - crime charges in the death of @entity22 , who was murdered on june 26 , 2011 , in @entity24 , @entity10 , the prosecutor says			1
@entity26 , 20 , admitted to two federal hate crime charges in other attacks carried out on other african - americans in or around @entity24			1
@entity22 , 47 , died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by @entity22 , who was part of a group of seven whites , mostly teenagers , from largely white @entity34 who decided to " go f * * k with some n * * * * * s " after a night of partying and drinking , law enforcement officials have said , quoting some of the suspects in the case			1
life sentence in @entity10 hate crime case @entity18 was one of the ones who left that party in search of a victim			1
@entity49 , a worker at a local auto plant , was outside a @entity24 hotel when he was confronted by the group			1
@entity49 's death became national news after @entity0 obtained and aired videotape capturing the gruesome murder as it happened			0
the death of the black man , and the shocking videotape showing the murder , prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in @entity24 , a city of about 537,000 people			1
on the videotape , two vehicles carrying the group of whites pull into the parking lot and stop where @entity49 is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible			2
the young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and @entity49			0
witnesses told authorities this is when @entity49 's beating took place , as the whites yelled racial epithets , including " white power			2
" on the videotape , @entity49 first comes into view in the lower right corner of the screen , after he was beaten , according to police			2
he staggers into the headlights of the green f - 250 truck , his white shirt easily visible			1
the truck backs up , then suddenly surges forward			2
as the truck nears the defenseless man , its headlights glow brightly on his shirt before he suddenly disappears underneath it			2
three of the other whites who were there that night pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes earlier this year			1
@entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , all now around age 20 , each admitted to conspiracy and violating the 2009 federal hate - crimes law			1
they face sentences of up to life in prison and $ 250,000 in fines , federal prosecutors said			0
@entity97 also pleaded guilty to state murder and hate - crime charges in a state court and was sentenced to life in prison			1
murder suspect carried ' backpack of hatred ' @entity26 was at a party with the others when they discussed going out to hunt and hurt blacks on the night @entity49 was killed , authorities said , but he was not present when the group came upon @entity49			1
however , he was present at other attacks at other times , prosecutors now say			0
@entity0 had reported previously that the attack on @entity49 was only one of a number of racial attacks carried out by the gang of young whites and others who were with them at various times , based on witness accounts and sources close to the investigation			0
prosecutors have long told @entity0 that the additional attacks might bring more arrests or charges			0
various groupings of the young men would , at various times , hunt out and target blacks , or others who appeared homeless or drunk , prosecutors said			0
these people were likely targeted , authorities said , because the group members believed they would be less likely to report attacks to police or to fight back			0
in these other attacks , according to prosecutors tuesday , the group of white young men , sometimes along with young women , on numerous occasions drove from @entity34 , which is mostly white , over to @entity24 , which is mostly black , specifically with the intent of assaulting blacks			1
group members would often boast about what they had done later , prosecutors said			0
in late 2011 @entity0 filmed an interview with one former member of the gang who had changed his ways and felt bad about their behavior			0
that former member told @entity0 on camera that the group of whites would " go out hunting " for blacks to hurt on weekends			0
but until @entity26 's plea tuesday , no details of such attacks had been made public , or had even been substantiated			1
in one of the other incidents the gang carried out , prosecutors say , @entity26 and other white teens drove to @entity24 to find an @entity178 to assault , and @entity26 brought with him a .40 - caliber handgun			1
the group hurled beer bottles at numerous black pedestrians they ran across			0
then , after seeing one black man who appeared to be drunk , a group of white teens set upon him , according to prosecutors			0
in that incident , prosecutors say , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity26 were among the ones who punched and kicked the man repeatedly on his face and all around his body , " until the man begged for his life			2
" after the group left the man beaten and wounded on the street , @entity26 wanted to go back " so that he could use the gun he had brought with him to shoot the @entity178 - @entity200 man they just assaulted , " according to court papers			1
but the group did not go back that night			0
" these teens laughed and boasted about what they had done , " said @entity204 , the district attorney for @entity24 and the main prosecutor in the case			2
and in court , federal prosecutor @entity209 said , " members of the group thought it was funny that the man pleaded for his life			1
" @entity26 could be sentenced to up to five years in prison for one count and 10 years for the other , @entity204 said			2
@entity18 faces up to five years for one count and up to life in prison for the other			2
prosecutors tell @entity0 there may be other arrests or charges			0
" this case is not over , " @entity204 said			0
" this is still ongoing			0
we would like to pursue justice fully for the @entity49 family			0
we want the @entity49 family to be pleased at the end of this case that justice was done			0
