-- evidence of another deadly attack in @entity5 has surfaced , this one with an incendiary agent , opposition activists said friday			1
seven people died and dozens were wounded monday in the attack on a school in northern @entity5 , they said			1
the allegation comes as @entity12 president @entity11 considers military action against the regime of @entity5 president @entity15 after what @entity12 officials and chemical weapons experts say was a chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of @entity21 on august 21			1
videos that activists said had been shot in the @entity24 of @entity25 after the monday attack show people with severe burns , but no other external injuries			2
@entity30 : @entity5 is a problem from hell for the @entity12 some people reported hearing nothing before chemicals started to burn them			0
" it 's like they used chemicals , like napalm or something , " said a doctor at a local hospital who confirmed the casualties			2
" it 's causing a lot of burns			2
" @entity0 has not been able to independently confirm the accounts			0
an expert who saw the videos , which were broadcast thursday on the @entity52 program " @entity53 , " said they did not appear to show the aftermath of a chemical weapons attack			1
what do @entity5 's neighbors think ? " you could see burns around the school , the playground , it looked like there had been a fire , " said @entity59 , professor of environmental toxicology at the @entity61 , in a telephone interview			1
" chemical weapons do n't cause that sort of destruction			1
@entity59 , who advises the @entity74 government on chemical weapons issues , applauded @entity77 's decision not to back @entity74 involvement in military action against the government in @entity21			1
" i think the @entity87 process should be allowed to run to completion , " he said , referring to secretary - general @entity82 's request that the @entity83 carry out an investigation on his behalf			2
the @entity83 oversees the @entity89 , which bans the production , stockpiling , and use of chemical weapons and has been signed by 189 countries			1
why @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 are standing by @entity5 if the @entity83 were to find that chemical weapons had indeed been used , that would pressure @entity95 and @entity94 -- which have signed it -- to support some action against @entity5 , @entity59 said			1
" these governments have been supportive of the @entity83 ; it would be very difficult for them to ignore a report produced by the @entity83 's inspectors			2
" it is the indiscriminate nature of chemical weapons that puts them in a particularly abhorrent category , noted @entity59 , who said he was confident they had been used in @entity5			1
" all of the features that i saw in all the videos that i 've seen , with individuals having no evidence of trauma , having great difficult breathing , suggests exposure to something that is causing asphyxia , " he said			0
" chemical agents in the nerve - agent category do this			2
" still , he added , " i 'd like to see the final proof			2
" does the public care about @entity87 support ? if the @entity83 were to conclude that chemical weapons had been used , the debate would then turn to who used them			1
the manufacture of chemical weapons such as sarin is a technique known to very few , he said			1
" it 's a very dangerous process because the chemical is so toxic , and you have to make sure that there 's protection for those involved in making it			1
otherwise , they will die			0
" putting the chemicals into a weapon requires another set of skills that are known to very few people , he said			0
" it 's not something you can do in your lockup or your garage ; it would , obviously , point to somebody like a government having these weapons			1
" @entity11 's talk about the use of chemical weapons crossing a " red line " appears to have put him into a corner , @entity59 said			1
" it 's difficult to know how he 's going to back out of that one , without some kind of punitive strike			2
" @entity59 said he hoped any military action would not be against @entity15 's chemical weapons stockpiles because " that runs the risk of spreading these agents even further			1
" @entity5 crisis : latest developments the alleged use of chemical weapons in the august 21 attack in a suburb of @entity21 was only the latest of more than a dozen such reports in recent months , according to @entity173 , the chairman of @entity74 's @entity174			1
" we have assessed previously that the @entity5 regime used lethal @entity179 ( chemical weapons ) on 14 occasions from 2012 , " he said thursday in a two - page report to prime minister @entity176			1
if what day described as " a clear pattern of regime use " of chemical weapons has indeed been established , why did the latest report spark a more bellicose response from world powers ? part of the answer lies in the scale of the event , in which hundreds of people are reported to have died , said dr. @entity191 , a consultant on chemical weapons for @entity192 and dean of the @entity194 at the @entity195			1
in addition , the evidence is strong , he said			0
" this time , there was enough videotaped evidence of victims subsequent to the attacks to provide a level of detail that allowed observers like myself to see signs that were consistent with an acute response to a nerve agent			0
and that level of specificity , i think , also increased the level of certainty and urgency to this			0
" @entity191 noted the august 24 report by @entity216 , also known as @entity216			0
it cited information from three hospitals it supports in @entity5 's @entity21 governorate that said some 3,600 patients had arrived at one of the hospitals within a three - hour time span showing neurotoxic symptoms , and that 355 of them died			2
" medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to @entity216 doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions , excess saliva , pinpoint pupils , blurred vision and respiratory distress , " said dr. @entity228 , @entity216 director of operations			0
secretary of state @entity241 said friday that @entity12 intelligence information found that 1,429 people were killed in the attack , including at least 426 children			2
patients were treated with atropine , a drug for neurotoxic symptoms			0
@entity228 said the group could neither confirm the cause of the symptoms nor identify who was responsible			0
however , he added , " the reported symptoms of the patients , in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time , the origin of the patients , and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent			0
this would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law , which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons			1
" @entity191 said that the reports of medical personnel winding up with some of the same symptoms suffered by their patients " is very consistent with a toxic @entity179 agent causing secondary effects			0
so , put it all together , it 's a very , very compelling case			2
" @entity281 , a senior fellow on state and non-state threats at the @entity284 , said thursday that the august 21 report stands apart from the others in the number of reported casualties			0
but questions remain about all of the reported cases -- as to what agents may have been involved and who was responsible , said @entity281			0
" i think it 's likely the @entity15 regime has ( used ) sarin on potentially two occasions , maybe three that we know if , but it 's done so using very , very small quantities of it , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			2
" and it 's used primarily to dislodge entrenched opposition forces and probably to test the international community " to see how it responds , he said			2
that would not explain the apparently large use reported in the august 21 attack , which crossed the administration 's oft - repeated " red line , " he said			1
" if it was a chemical attack , if it was the @entity15 regime , it was such an egregious and completely irrational use of chemical weapons that the administration had to respond , " he said			1
but that has left the administration in a dilemma , he said			0
" there 's nobody on the ground right now that they can identify that they can back safely without the risk of that group being overrun or taken over by the jihadist groups in @entity5			0
" in other words , the jihadists could wind up being empowered if the @entity11 administration carries out an attack , he said			0
" if they do n't play this right , the leadership in @entity21 could be jihadist -- with a large chemical weapons arsenal at their disposal			1
" @entity281 proposed three theories about why the @entity5 regime might have carried out the attack : -- it is playing an " incredibly complex chess game , playing like what @entity340 used to play -- it makes sense to them , but we ca n't even figure it out ; " -- the regime is beginning to disintegrate and the attacks were carried out by rogue elements and was not authorized ; -- the leadership has lost touch with reality			0
attacking the regime would be a risky move , he said			0
" you do n't know the response			0
they could launch scuds at @entity357 full of sarin			0
" another concern : the command and control over the country 's vast stocks of chemical weapons could be delegative , meaning that subordinates in the field may have the power to launch the stocks if certain conditions are met			1
" so , if the @entity12 destroys x , y and z , it could actually trigger a response from commanders in the field			0
" and @entity281 added that he was not persuaded that chemical weapons have indeed been used			1
" there 's nothing available in open sources that they definitively have been , " he said			0
verification is critical given the @entity12 government 's history of being duped about the alleged weapons of mass destruction that preceded the @entity12 - led attack on @entity386			1
" words ca n't describe how catastrophic it was , " @entity281 said			0
" most people in the community are skeptical			0

it does not appear to be a chemical weapons attack , expert says
professor says he 's confident chemical weapons have been used , but wants proof
