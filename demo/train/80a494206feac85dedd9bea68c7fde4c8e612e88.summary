-- part of being a child is developing your identity			2
@entity4 can teach you knowledge			1
@entity6 can teach you what it expects of you			0
but , once you develop a sense of yourself , no one and nothing can tell you who you are			2
you come to know that -- to your core			2
when a child 's sense of self develops in ways that are traditional and unremarkable , nobody takes much notice			1
but when it happens in ways that challenge traditional norms or expectations , people often try to " correct " it			1
such is the heart of a controversy brewing in @entity28 involving a first - grader and , of all things , a bathroom			2
the unlikely center of this uproar is a little 6 - year - old girl , @entity35			1
@entity35 knows she 's a girl			1
she dresses as a girl			2
her legal documents recognize her as a girl			0
her parents accept her as a girl			0
on the playground , you would have difficulty identifying her as different from any of the other girls , because in all ways that matter socially and legally , this child is a girl			1
the problem is that @entity35 was born in the body of a boy , so the school district wants her to use the boys ' bathroom , or some bathroom other than the one the other girls use			1
the @entity56 has filed a complaint with the @entity58 on behalf of @entity35 and her family			1
discrimination complaint filed for transgender girl although generations of people facing a similar mind / body dissonance have been forced to hide , to pretend , to live unhappy and empty lives simply for being different , the world is changing			1
kids such as @entity35 finally have a chance to avoid a similar fate with their dignity and their self - image intact , given the right support and opportunity			1
vice president @entity75 has long been a supporter of gay , lesbian and transgender rights , referring to them as civil rights issues			0
it seems odd to think of this first - grader who simply wants to use the bathroom as a civil rights pioneer			0
but crossing seemingly simple barriers for rights is nothing new -- whether to ride a bus , to attend a school or to use a bathroom just like everyone else			0
it is unfortunate that we keep having to relearn these lessons			0
i doubt many people stop to consider that the single most significant moment in their lives happens within minutes of their births			0
that 's when , upon simple inspection , a doctor or a nurse pronounces a baby a boy or a girl			1
that seemingly simple and obvious proclamation has reverberations for the rest of our lives			0
i can empathize with @entity35 because i faced those same overwhelming questions myself , almost 50 years ago			1
i came to know a similar mistake had been made , except that at that time , i did n't have words to explain it			0
i learned to live a lie			0
pretending to be what you 're not , hoping things will magically fix themselves , seems easier at times			0
news : frat pays for brother 's sex change it is unfortunate that @entity35 's school has not learned the lesson that so many other aspects of our culture have already acknowledged , that a person 's gender is more complicated than a body part or a chromosome			1
workplaces across this country are recognizing the challenges that their transgender workers face and are removing deeply embedded barriers to health care and wellness benefits			0
organizations ranging from the @entity144 to the @entity145 are accepting transyouth , sometimes under fire , treating children based on identify , not body parts			1
transwomen have openly competed in mainstream beauty pageants and have been featured in magazines such as @entity152			0
transgender athletes , artists and writers , people in all fields , have shown there is a pathway to a happy , well - adjusted and fulfilling life -- not as an " other , " but as the men and women we know ourselves to be			1
apparently none of this matters to the school that denies @entity35 the use of the girls ' bathroom or to the parents who demonize her and her family			1
arguments to treat @entity35 with dignity often fall on deaf ears			1
why ? because discussion of the topic quickly becomes emotional rather than rational			0
when i came out to my own mother , at 40 years old , i was a parent , i had been married to a woman i loved for 20 years , i had a successful career , we owned two homes , and there was n't a single person who would have guessed my secret or my struggle			2
but in the end , a quote from @entity190 : " it is better to be hated for what you are than loved for what you are not , " resonated to the point that i finally became who i should have been			0
today , my family and i have never been closer			0
i have never been more in tune with myself and the world around me			0
my relationships have never been more fulfilling			0
those who would cling to outdated stereotypes of transpeople as sad , lonely , misguided , freakish and broken see more and more examples of people who bloom when they find the strength , and the opportunity , to become authentic			2
my own advice for @entity35 and her family : keep the spirit of the @entity213 close to your heart			2
know that this journey is far more about happiness and fulfillment than about body parts or bathrooms			1
to @entity35 's parents , @entity223 and @entity224 : doing what 's right for your daughter will make a bigger difference for her , and for others , than you know			1
and last , do n't forget to hug one another every day			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

@entity233 : when a child 's sense of self is *nontraditional* , people want to " correct " it
@entity233 : @entity35 , 6 , is in every *respect* a girl , but she ca n't use girls ' bathroom
@entity233 : @entity4 should know gender is not body parts , it is who you are to the core
@entity233 realized that to live an authentic life she needed to become a woman
