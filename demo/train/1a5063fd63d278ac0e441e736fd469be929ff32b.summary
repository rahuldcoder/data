-- online classified service @entity5 's decision to censor its adult services section could be a model for other websites , a leader in the fight against prostitution ads said saturday			1
" this step is very much in the right direction , " said @entity11 attorney general @entity10 , who spearheaded a letter from 17 attorneys general who recently banded together to urge @entity5 to discontinue its adult services section			1
the embattled website has been under fire for allegations that it promotes prostitution			2
" these prostitution ads enable human trafficking and assaults on women , " said @entity10			0
" they are flagrant and rampant			0
@entity5 has lacked the wherewithal or will to effectively screen them out			2
" the section that usually reads " adult services " on @entity5 was replaced by the word " censored			1
" it was not immediately clear whether @entity5 removed the adult services and replaced them with the " censored " section , which had a link that was not active			1
but for users who accessed the account outside the @entity37 , the erotic services link was still active			0
@entity5 representatives told @entity0 on saturday that they will release a statement at a later time			2
" the message here is put people over profits , " said @entity10 , who is running for the @entity41 from @entity11 as a @entity42			2
he said officials will continue monitoring @entity5 and other websites for such content			2
" the increasingly sharp public criticism of @entity5 's @entity56 section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it , " the attorneys general had said in an aug. 24 letter to @entity5 ceo @entity52 and founder @entity53			1
a @entity5 spokeswoman said at the time that the site agreed with at least some of the letter			0
" we strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women , through the @entity74 or by any other means , " said @entity67 , who handles press inquiries for @entity5			1
" we hope to work closely with them , as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement , to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking , and to combat such crimes wherever they appear , online or offline			0
" in their letter , the attorneys general highlighted an open letter , which appeared as a @entity89 ad , in which two girls said they were sold for sex on @entity5			1
when the ad came out , @entity52 wrote a blog post in response that said , " @entity5 is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls ' cases are behind bars			0
" the letter also highlighted a report in may by @entity0 's @entity101 , who posted a fake ad for a girl 's services in the adult section			1
she received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours			0
earlier this month , @entity108 interviewed a woman named " @entity110 " who sells sex on @entity5			0
the woman said a @entity5 ad was " the fastest , quickest way you 're for sure going to see somebody that day			0
" in a later blog post , @entity52 said @entity5 implemented manual screening of adult services ads in may 2009			1
" since that time , before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney , " the post said			0
he said the attorneys are trained to enforce @entity5 's posting guidelines , " which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages , newspapers , or any other company that we are aware of			2
" attorneys general from @entity131 , @entity11 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 made the request a week after accused " @entity148 " @entity148 committed suicide in jail			1
@entity148 was charged with the april 2009 killing of @entity152			0
@entity153 said that @entity152 , a model , advertised as a masseuse on @entity5 , and @entity148 might have met her through the website			2
in 2008 , under pressure from state prosecutors , the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. in 2009 , it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity			1
a @entity0 investigation of @entity5 's adult services section , which replaced " erotic services ads " two years ago , counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day			1
many offered thinly veiled " services " for anything from $ 50 for a half - hour to $ 400 an hour			0
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
