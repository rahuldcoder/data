@entity0 , @entity1 -- even as @entity6 @entity5 @entity4 took to the skies from this southern @entity1 air base , there was mounting tension between allies about who should command the mission to protect civilians and enforce a no - fly zone in @entity15			1
after heated exchanges between @entity19 ambassadors in @entity20 , the alliance announced tuesday an operation to enforce the arms embargo against @entity15			1
but it went no further on deciding if or when @entity19 would take command of the mission already under way , in which several allies are participating			1
in a statement , @entity19 only said that it had plans on the table to enforce the no - fly zone " if needed			2
" the backdrop was a simmering feud between @entity35 and @entity1 that turned more cynical by the hour			0
@entity1 is demanding that @entity19 take a lead role in the military and political decision - making during the remainder of the @entity15 mission			1
but resistance within the alliance mounted even as the @entity43 expressed its desire to take a back seat in the operation and hand over any command role to @entity49 allies			1
@entity35 seemed most reluctant to submit to @entity19 command , but @entity51 and @entity52 also voiced objections			2
these countries also argue that @entity56 nations would be shut out of any decision - making if @entity19 took control			2
@entity51 foreign minister @entity59 said he continues to believe it was right not to participate in the @entity62 - sanctioned mission			1
he noted that @entity51 is not alone in its skeptical view of military action , pointing to the fact that other @entity49 nations are not taking part either			0
@entity59 also refused to comment on whether @entity19 should take a leading role in enforcing @entity62 resolution 1973			0
" that is for the coalition of the willing to debate , " @entity59 said			0
@entity35 foreign minister @entity72 told @entity35 media that @entity19 would play a role in the mission in coming days but that @entity35 , @entity6 and a council of other coalition partners would make political decisions			1
one @entity19 official described this to @entity2 as putting the alliance 's assets at the disposal of the coalition , but @entity19 would have no formal political role			2
the squabbling continued as @entity1 foreign minister @entity87 again threatened to take back complete control of @entity1 airbases if @entity19 did not take the reins of the mission			1
" who , if not @entity19 , can take on this task ? " said @entity87 in comments to @entity1 media			0
some @entity1 politicians sought to settle old colonial scores by cynically noting that if @entity35 was allowed to lead this mission , it would get all the @entity15 oil contracts and @entity1 would get all the @entity15 refugees			1
on a busy day at the @entity102 in southern @entity1 , @entity4 executed a number of sorties to enforce the no - fly zone in @entity15			0
" the @entity1 support is crucial , " said @entity5 commander , group captain @entity106 , but added that his fighters could operate from other locations			0
" it 's a decision for our headquarters and our political masters			0
" discussions between @entity19 allies will continue this week as the alliance continues to disagree over the parameters and scope of the @entity62 resolution that authorized all means necessary to protect civilians in @entity15 , as well as imposing a no - fly zone over the country			1
as well as disagreeing over whether @entity15 leader @entity125 is a legitimate target , there is the question of whether @entity15 will split along tribal lines or whether a united @entity15 is even a possibility			0
there is no appetite among coalition allies to get involved in a tribal grudge match or civil war			0
@entity52 , also a @entity19 member , also voiced its opposition to a political role for the alliance and has forcefully suggested that the mission so far has already gone beyond the intention of the @entity62 resolution to protect civilians			2
however , one @entity19 source told @entity2 that they did not see @entity52 's objections so far as a major stumbling block to a further role for @entity19 .			0

@entity49 allies argue over *future* of mission against @entity15
@entity35 's foreign minister suggests a steering *committee* to make political decisions
@entity19 says it will enforce an arms embargo against @entity15
