-- as @entity1 said , the nicer the nice , the higher the @entity3 question is , is the more expensive @entity4 nicer than the comparable @entity5 ? the experience is markedly different , that 's for sure			1
anyone familiar with @entity10 's market - leading tablet -- and the @entity4 invites the comparison -- will face a few moments of disorientation when picking up the @entity4 for the first time			1
a few details are unsettling to @entity5 users , such as the location of the power button ( on the rear of the device ) , the lack of front - facing command buttons , and the unfamiliar location of the volume rocker			2
those details will be irrelevant to @entity26 users , of course , but even dedicated @entity29 fans will find that the @entity4 's version of the os , @entity29 , takes a bit of getting used to			1
some things do n't work the same as they do on older versions of @entity29			0
for instance , instead of holding down the ( virtual ) " home " button to see a list of running apps , there 's now a separate icon for displaying a vertical menu of apps			2
to see the full list of installed apps , you press a separate " apps " button in the upper right of the screen			0
and while the lack of front hardware buttons gives the device a cleaner look , it does mean that virtual buttons clutter up the display and rob you of screen space in most applications			0
but once you 've oriented yourself to @entity29 's and @entity4 's idiosyncracies , what emerges is a tablet that 's very well suited to reading and to video			1
the @entity4 has a 10.1 - inch screen ( measuring 8.5 by 5.25 inches ) , and it 's as bright and sharp as any other high - end tablet			1
we did notice a slightly discolored band running down the edge of the screen on one side , but since we ca n't compare it to other @entity75 yet , we do n't know if this is a problem with our review unit or a more general manufacturing defect			0
the 1280 × 800 screen is pretty close to a standard widescreen aspect ratio , so videos can fill the whole screen with minimal clipping			0
the @entity4 is a little bit shorter than the @entity5 in landscape mode , but that means that when you flip the @entity4 to portrait mode , the screen is skinnier and taller			1
this is actually perfect for reading books , scrolling down web pages , or catching up on @entity92			0
it 's comfortable to hold the @entity4 with one hand while you swipe with the other , and because the vertical page is so tall , there 's less swiping than on smaller screens			1
wired : read more about @entity5 's @entity100 the rubbery back panel has enough grip that you do n't really need to clamp onto the thing while you 're reading			2
if you feel fatigued by holding your @entity5 one - handed for long periods of time like i do , you 'll appreciate this			2
in short , it 's an excellent , basic media consumption device -- as long as your media does n't rely on stellar audio			2
if you 're planning on zoning out with a movie or a few videos , we 'd recommend keeping a decent pair of headphones on hand			0
the big problem with the sound ? the speakers are in the back of the tablet			1
they sound fine if you turn the tablet around to face the speakers toward you , but if you 're holding the @entity4 so you can see its screen , the sound is projecting away from your head			1
everything sounds muffled : movie dialog is harder to understand and music just sounds dead and lifeless			0
there 's an optional dock with speakers built in , but when you plop the @entity4 into the dock to watch a movie , the dock speakers sit behind the tablet , too			1
so it 's the same problem all over again , just a little louder			2
the @entity4 has two cameras : a front - facing , 2 - megapixel camera is meant for video conferencing and webcam chats , while a rear - facing , 5 - megapixel camera is meant for shooting still photos and video			1
taking pictures with it feels funny			0
it 's the same as snapping a picture your phone , except the thing you 're holding is four times the size			2
on the other hand , being able to compose a photo while looking at something bigger than a 5 × 7 print is a real luxury , as it lets you see details you would n't otherwise notice on a small phone screen or camera viewfinder			0
it 's awkward , but we suspect it will become commonplace within a few months now that every tablet is getting a camera built into the back			1
with an $ 800 entry price ( or $ 600 if you 're willing to commit to a two - year @entity173 data contract at $ 20 per month ) , the @entity4 is a bigger leap of faith than @entity10 's market - leading tablet			1
granted , the most comparable @entity5 -- the one with @entity176 of storage and a 3g wireless connection -- costs $ 730 , making it just $ 70 cheaper than the un-subsidized @entity4			1
but if you want to sample the @entity5 , a @entity180 only version is available for $ 500 , and so far @entity182 has announced nothing in a comparable price range for the @entity4			1
for that reason we think fewer people are likely to jump on the @entity4 bandwagon			1
those who do will be attracted by the widescreen format , the ability to buy apps without going through @entity10 's restrictive @entity191			1
for those who want a more fully - finished , polished experience , however , we recommend waiting for a future @entity29 tablet -- or the @entity5			2
the @entity4 is a credible contender , but it 's not quite on par with the market leader yet			1
@entity0 @entity199 , widescreen display offers plenty of room for video and for reading			0
fast 1 - @entity204 processor promises great performance for future games and apps			0
@entity29 simplifies and optimizes the @entity29 interface for tablets			0
dual cameras and an optional external keyboard make this a credible notebook ( or at least netbook ) replacement			0
tired @entity217 - facing speakers do n't do justice to any kind of audio			2
the button thing is weird			0
@entity29 seems to have some bugs to work out			0
