@entity0 -- with longtime @entity3 sen. @entity3 going down in defeat , @entity2 were quick to paint the conservative candidate who beat him in @entity8 's primary as " too extreme			1
" the result in @entity8 was what @entity2 had hoped for , but as the old proverb goes : " be careful what you wish for , it might just come true			2
" @entity3 is the longest - serving @entity14 in the @entity15 and is known as a moderate who has been willing to reach across the aisle to work with @entity2 during his 36 years in the chamber			1
he was defeated by more than 20 points in tuesday 's primary by @entity22 , the two - term @entity8 state treasurer , a much more conservative candidate who enjoyed strong backing from local and national tea party groups , as well as some other leading fiscal conservative organizations			1
@entity22 says he does n't anticipate successful compromise in the @entity15 and hopes bipartisanship will be defined as @entity2 backing the @entity14 agenda following the 2012 elections			2
" i hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes @entity2 joining republicans to roll back the size of government , reduce the bureaucracy and get @entity38 moving again , " @entity22 said wednesday morning on @entity1 's " starting point with @entity31			1
" he added that those on both sides of the aisle should not compromise their principles , saying that " one side or the other has to win this argument , one side or the other will dominate			0
" minutes after @entity22 's victory over @entity3 , national @entity2 were quick to characterize @entity22 as too extreme for @entity8			1
" @entity22 is a right wing @entity52 ideologue who questioned the constitutionality of @entity56 and @entity57 , says there should be more partisanship and less compromise in @entity0 , and actually compared himself to @entity61 , " declared @entity48 , the executive director of the @entity49 , in a statement			0
" tens of thousands of @entity63 who have voted for @entity3 their entire voting lives are going to reject a @entity52 candidate like @entity22 and support an honest , common sense job creator like @entity69 , " added @entity48			2
@entity69 , the @entity2 ' @entity15 nominee , is a former small business owner and current three - term congressman who represents @entity8 's second district , which includes @entity72 and other areas of the north - central part of the state			2
@entity48 compared @entity22 to @entity76 , the former @entity77 , @entity78 , district attorney who defeated the more moderate former lt. gov. @entity80 in @entity78 's 2010 @entity82 @entity15 primary then went on to lose his general election challenge to @entity49 sen. @entity84			1
national democrats hope that @entity69 will fare better against @entity22 than he would have against @entity3 in a general election , where moderate voters from both parties and independents are crucial in determining who wins and loses			1
national republicans quickly rallied around @entity22			0
sen. @entity92 of @entity93 , chairman of the @entity94 , said in a statement that @entity22 " has the @entity94 's full support and we are committed to helping elect him as @entity8 's next @entity15 in november			2
" and @entity15 minority leader @entity99 of @entity100 said he fully backs @entity22 and looks " forward to welcoming him to the @entity15 next year			0
" freshman sen. @entity102 of @entity103 , a darling of conservatives , sent an e-mail to his fundraising list tuesday night , asking people to donate to @entity22 's campaign			0
while @entity82 rally around @entity22 , @entity2 have the match - up they dreamed about in @entity8			1
they suggest that many " disillusioned " @entity3 supporters may now cross over and vote for @entity69			2
and @entity48 said that the @entity22 victory over @entity3 " makes the @entity112 race a toss - up			1
" but that 's not the take right now from two of the top non-partisan political handicappers			0
the @entity119 is keeping its ranking of the contest as " @entity14			0
" " @entity22 is n't @entity125 , " says @entity119 , the report 's editor and publisher			0
@entity125 was the tea party - backed candidate in @entity127 who pulled an upset in the state 's 2010 @entity82 @entity15 primary , defeating longtime rep. @entity131 , the @entity82 establishment candidate			1
@entity125 lost by 16 points in the general election to @entity135 @entity134			0
" while a @entity22 - @entity69 race will start off close , with some @entity82 bitter over @entity3 's loss , over the long haul , @entity2 have a decidedly uphill fight in this @entity14 - leaning state , " @entity119 added			1
the @entity141 is moving its rating of the race from " likely @entity14 " to " @entity14			0
" " this race is more competitive than it would have been if @entity3 were the @entity82 nominee			1
we do n't feel that it 's in the toss up column now , but there 's a potential to get there , " @entity150 , who covers @entity15 races for @entity152			0
then - sen. @entity153 won @entity8 in 2008 , the first @entity135 to capture the state in a presidential election in 40 years			0
but @entity153 's re-election campaign may not spend a great amount of money and resources to try to keep the state in the " @entity161 " column this november , further complicating the @entity2 ' hopes of capturing @entity3 's @entity15 seat			1
as for the big picture , the @entity2 currently hold a 53 - 47 majority in the @entity15			0
but they are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in november .			0

democrats hoped to run against @entity22 , who they say is too " extreme "
@entity22 defeated @entity3 , @entity82 's longest - serving senator , in primary
@entity141 moved the race from " likely " @entity82 win to leaning that way
@entity2 hope disillusioned @entity3 backers will cross lines
