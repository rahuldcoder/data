-- two snowy owls injured by the downdraft of jets taking off in @entity4 have been released in a safer place where the likes of saltmarsh sparrows and piping plovers flutter amid marshes , bogs and beach dunes			1
the pair were released monday morning at @entity13 on @entity14 in northeastern @entity15 , after nearly eight weeks of treatment and rehabilitation , said dr. @entity18 , director of the wildlife clinic where the birds were treated			1
the yellow - eyed , white birds were taken in march to the @entity22 in @entity23 , where one was treated for soft - tissue wounds and the other had lifesaving surgery for a broken wing , said @entity18			2
the owls were rescued by @entity29 , director of the @entity31 's @entity30 , after they were injured at @entity32			1
the owls have been a concern for decades at the airport , where authorities use nets to catch the birds before relocating them , @entity29 told @entity0 in december			1
a greater number of owls have been reported at the airport this year , @entity18 said			2
@entity32 officials have captured and released more than 100 snowy owls this winter , as opposed to just 10 owls last year , she said			1
the influx is possibly due to an abundance of prey			0
@entity32 's likeness to the tundra makes it a favorable place for the birds to land , but a dangerous place to fly , @entity18 said			1
@entity22 , part of the @entity55 at @entity56 , has treated six snowy owls this year			1
the clinic has a 100 - foot flight pen that 's used for conditioning , a key part in the owl 's recovery , she said			2
" we go in there and we bug them			0
we walk down to the end where they 're perched and they 'll fly down to the other end			0
so we end up exercising them , " @entity18 said			0
although snowy owls are not an endangered species , their numbers are declining and nobody knows the actual population of these birds , said @entity29			1
@entity18 said the rise and fall in the number of owls they treat each year varies			0
" we try not to get attached because they 're wild animals and many wild animals do n't make it			0
it 's really hard for them in captivity , " she said			0
@entity18 said she believes these two owls are the last the clinic will see this season , because most have already migrated back toward the @entity92			2
" they 'll probably spend a little bit more time hanging around @entity14 , building up strength before going up north			0
" @entity0 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0
