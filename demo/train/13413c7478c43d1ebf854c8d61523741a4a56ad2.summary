@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you have a tv you have heard , or heard of , vuvuzelas			1
they 're the cheap plastic horns played by tens of thousands of spectators in @entity9 soccer stadiums in @entity10 and buzzing like so many unswattable mosquitoes in the ear of an irate camper			1
to hear most viewers tell it , " vuvuzela " -- like " abattoir " -- is a beautiful word for an ugly thing			0
the horns drone for the entire 90 minutes of every game , and that is the perfect word for what they do : drone , like the male bee that does no work -- idling pointlessly , unproductively , infuriatingly , to no end			0
or so say the multitudes that now watch the games with the sound muted			0
i 've tried muting the tv			1
the vuvuzelas still ring in my ear long after the sound is turned off and even after the game has ended			2
the world of sports has given us swimmer 's ear , tennis elbow and athlete 's foot			0
here , at last , is an affliction named for the spectator at home : couch potato 's tinnitus , turning every @entity9 fan into a @entity53 roadie			1
there is no clear etymology for the word vuvuzela , but my guess is it derives from the @entity58 ( blood ) and " zela " ( issuing from both ears )			0
the buzz it has created for the @entity9 is not the kind @entity65 intended			2
tv viewers and newspaper writers this week have demanded that vuvuzelas be banished from @entity10 stadiums for the monthlong tournament			1
they argue that the horns drown out singing and chanting , the traditional soundtrack for soccer			2
to read the editorials , you 'd think that the @entity78 has been serenading @entity79 and @entity80 when they play each other in the @entity82			0
i 've been to plenty of @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity9 matches			1
many of the songs and chants now being drowned out by the vuvuzelas are in far worse taste than the plastic horns			1
they make the vuvuzela sound like @entity96 playing @entity98 's trumpet on a cloud in heaven			2
perhaps it 's the @entity102 , but i 've grown to like the vuvuzela , for any number of reasons			0
with the @entity107 , the vuvuzela joins the ticking stopwatch on " @entity109 " and the piercing signal of the @entity111 in the pantheon of nonmusical sounds that instantly tell you what is on tv even before you 've entered the room			0
it denies us tranquility , sure , but the vuvuzela is a little bit like tranquility : a beautiful word for a beautiful thing			0
long after the @entity9 final is played on july 11 , the sound of the vuvuzela will remain instantly evocative of @entity10 -- as the didjeridoo is to @entity131 , the bagpipe is to @entity132 or the car horn is to @entity134			1
and even if i did n't like the vuvuzela , i would keep my objections to myself			0
it is n't polite to tell another country how to watch a soccer match			2
the sound that issues from the vuvuzela is cacophonous -- joyful and infuriating at the same time			1
it calls to mind mosquitoes on a continent tragically ravaged by those malaria - bearing insects			0
for better and worse , the vuvuzela is the sound of @entity10			1
as @entity148 said : " if you do n't live it , it wo n't come out your horn			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0

@entity156 says buzzing at @entity9 is vuvuzelas , horns played by @entity10 fans
they drive people crazy , he says ; even muting tv wo n't take the sound out of your ears
but *raucous* chants at most soccer matches are not exactly music either , he says
@entity156 : @entity175 may by infuriating , but it 's also joyful and is the sound of @entity10
