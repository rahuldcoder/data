a grand jury in @entity1 has decided not to indict police officers in the august shooting death of a 22 - year - old man carrying an air rifle at a @entity7 store in @entity8 , @entity1			1
" the grand jury listened to all the evidence , voted on it and decided that the police officers were justified in their use of force that day , " prosecutor @entity9 said on wednesday			1
in a statement , @entity1 attorney general @entity15 said the @entity17 will review the shooting of @entity20 resident @entity19 " now that the state criminal investigation has finished , it is an appropriate time for the @entity17 to look into whether any federal laws were violated during this shooting , " the statement said			1
@entity25 , attorney representing @entity27 's family , said the decision against indicting was " incomprehensible			2
" " it makes absolutely no sense that an unarmed 22 - year - old man would be killed doing what any @entity34 citizen does every day : shopping at a @entity7 store , " he said in a statement			1
" the @entity27 family is extremely disappointed , disgusted and confused			0
they are heartbroken that justice was not done in the tragic death of their only son			0
" the statement added , " the @entity27 family feels they have been victimized all over again and once again request that the @entity34 @entity17 conduct an independent investigation into the tragic death of @entity27 , lll			2
" @entity27 was shot and killed by police at a @entity7 in @entity8 on august 5 while carrying an air rifle through the store			1
police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that @entity27 was walking around with a rifle and " waving it back and forth			2
" according to police , when officers arrived , @entity27 did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon			2
he was shot twice , once in the elbow and once in the torso , @entity9 said			2
@entity27 died shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital			0
his death was ruled a homicide by gunshot wound to the torso , according to the local coroner 's office			0
@entity9 , who led the team of prosecutors that presented evidence to the @entity73 grand jury , called @entity27 's death " a perfect storm of circumstances			1
" first , there was the fact that an unwrapped air rifle was left on top of its box inside of the store			1
next , the fact that @entity27 decided to pick it up and carry it with him			0
and the fact that the 911 caller , identified in police reports as @entity89 , noticed the weapon in @entity27 's hand and called authorities			0
and finally , the fact that the gun bore such a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon			0
" it is very hard to tell the difference , " @entity9 said			0
prosecutors also showed surveillance video from inside the store , which had not been made public until wednesday			0
in the video , @entity27 can be seen picking the air rifle off a shelf and walking around the store with it before being confronted by police			1
the two police officers who were involved -- sgt. @entity109 and officer @entity110 -- were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting , but @entity109 has returned to active duty , according to @entity8 city attorney @entity114			1
@entity110 will be assigned to administrative desk duty until a federal review of the circumstances surrounding @entity27 's death is complete , according to a statement			1
@entity25 said @entity7 surveillance video and eyewitness accounts prove @entity110 " shot and killed mr. @entity27 while his back was turned and without adequate warning			1
" @entity8 city manager @entity125 and police chief @entity126 have requested that the @entity127 review the case to determine whether there were civil rights violations , the statement said			2
" the events of august 5th were tragic and we wish the outcome of that evening had been different , " the statement says			0
the statement said @entity109 and @entity110 " did what they were trained to do to protect the public			0
" @entity9 called the case one with " no bad guys			0
" " mr. @entity27 did not commit a crime that day , " he said			0
the nine - member grand jury , which convened on monday , heard from 18 witnesses			1
an indictment on charges of murder , reckless homicide or negligent homicide would have required seven votes , @entity9 said			0
vote counts from grand jury votes are not made public .			1

@entity1 grand jury *declines* to indict police officers for *fatally* shooting man with air rifle
