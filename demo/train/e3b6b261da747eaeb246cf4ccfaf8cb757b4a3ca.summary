in an unusual step , a @entity1 congressman is proposing a two - year ban on all new federal legislation regulating the @entity5			1
rep. @entity6 , a @entity7 from @entity8 who has been an advocate for @entity5 freedoms , has posted online a draft of his legislation , the @entity13 of 2012			1
the bill would " create a two - year moratorium on any new laws , rules or regulations governing the @entity5			1
" @entity6 first posted the complete text of the bill monday on @entity21 , the nickname for a crowdsourcing platform that allows citizens to amend individual passages of legislation by adding or striking language			1
on tuesday , he posted a link to the bill on @entity30 , the social news site , where users quickly voted it to the top			1
" together , we can make @entity37 take a break from messing w / the @entity5 , " @entity6 said on @entity30 , where he also invited users to suggest changes to the proposed bill			1
he said he will begin taking questions about it from @entity30 users wednesday morning			2
@entity6 is one of the more tech - fluent members of @entity43 and was an outspoken critic of the @entity45 , which would have penalized websites that host pirated content			1
that bill died this year amid near - unanimous opposition from the technology industry			2
it was not immediately clear whether @entity6 's moratorium would apply to his own online protection and enforcement of digital trade ( open ) act , which would seek to protect @entity1 copyrights and trademarks from infringement by foreign websites			1
initial reaction on @entity30 to his proposed moratorium was mixed			0
some users were confused about what point @entity6 was trying to make , while others saw the move as a stunt			2
" i have a problem with legislation that preemptively ties your hands for years at a time			0
you ca n't know what the internet or society will look like in six months , let alone two years , and making it harder to respond to emerging threats or opportunities is an abdication of your responsibilities as a member of @entity43 , " wrote one @entity30 user			0
" this just seems to me to be more cheap political theater , along the lines of @entity89 's ' we will never ever ever raise taxes for any reason ' pledge			0
" " the answer is not to ban new regulation			0
we need regulation , " another said			0
" but , i do n't believe anybody in @entity43 has the vocabulary , is intelligent in knowing how the internet or computers work , or has the foresight to put current trends and future technologies together in a context to create those new regulation that protect the internet and it 's users / consumers			0
" @entity6 's @entity30 post had drawn more than 2,000 comments by early wednesday			2
@entity105 , writing for @entity107 , also dismissed @entity6 's idea			2
" open internet ? that 's a good thing			0
but a law that keeps congress from governing ? that 's not a good thing -- the internet is a big place , and the language of this law is very broad , " she wrote			0
" as it stands now , @entity13 is just a discussion draft , meaning it will be a very long time before it 's even close to a vote			2
and while we 're for an open internet , a blanket ban is a bad idea			0
let 's think about this one a little more , rep. @entity6			1
" when asked why the congressman introduced the bill , a spokesman for @entity6 told @entity131 , " after @entity45 and @entity132 ( the @entity133 's similar @entity132 ) , it became very clear that we needed a cooling - off period to figure out a better way to create policy that impacts @entity5 users , job creators and all @entity1			1
" the spokesman , who asked not to be named , declined further comment tuesday .			0
