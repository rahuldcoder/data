-- while @entity2 's star striker faces an uncomfortable wait to see what his alleged chomp on @entity5 will mean for the rest of his @entity8 -- and possibly his international future @entity10 -- the world was equally aghast and amused at the sight of the footballer 's on - field antics			1
@entity15 , who plays his club football for @entity18 team @entity17 and has just come off the back of an inspirational season , appeared to bite @entity21 defender @entity5 towards the end of their @entity8 group game			2
he was n't punished on the pitch , and @entity2 duly went on to win the match , knocking four - time champions @entity21 out in the process			1
@entity15 is a national hero in @entity2 , a truly world - class player from this small but football - obsessed nation			1
his inclusion in the team despite a recent injury layoff has inspired @entity34 to two wins and qualification to the next round			0
unrepentant but while the world howls in barely - concealed glee and indignation at the incident , the @entity39 press is remaining po - faced about @entity15 ' latest on - field folly			1
@entity45 's fourth estate mostly played down the incident , with @entity47 leading with the fact that @entity49 will investigate the incident , alongside a fairly sympathetic report carrying comments made by @entity15 to tv station @entity2 , in which he played down his part in the scuffle			1
" these things happen in the ( penalty ) box , " an unrepentant @entity15 was reported as saying			2
they certainly do , if only for him			0
this is the third time he 's been accused of baring his fangs on the pitch , following incidents in @entity64 and @entity65			1
in 2010 he received a seven - match ban for a bite on @entity69 's midfielder @entity68 , and was sanctioned again in 2013 for gnawing on @entity71 's @entity70			2
that earned him ten games on the sidelines			0
he was also accused of racially abusing @entity76 international @entity75 during an @entity18 match , earning him an eight - game ban			2
he also has @entity8 form , ruining @entity81 's hopes of progressing last time out with an obvious handball			0
in @entity83 , too , he seemed to show little remorse			0
support the player received the immediate backing of his international manager			0
" if you continue to attack we will see how to defend @entity15 , " @entity2 coach @entity89 said , quoted in the @entity39 edition of futbol , com			1
" this is a @entity8 and not cheap morality			0
" the site also carried a piece slamming the @entity100 press ' reaction to their pantomime villain 's latest on - field snack			1
the @entity39 reaction was n't all denial , however			0
@entity105 's in @entity2 got in early with a twitter joke at the national hero 's expense , inviting him to come assuage his hunger at one of their restaurants : " hey @ luis16suarez , if you 're still hungry take a bite of a @entity115 " the refrain was echoed around the twittersphere , with a number of companies bearing toothy grins as they made light of @entity15 ' actions			1
# suarez and # bansuarez also trended for hours after the game			0
@entity49 has opened proceedings against the forward , for breach of @entity49 disciplinary code			0
@entity49 added that @entity15 and / or his national association are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant , with a 5 p.m. ( @entity136 time ) deadline			2
