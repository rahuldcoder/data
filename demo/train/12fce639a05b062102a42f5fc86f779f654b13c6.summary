-- what do you most want to know about your mom but would never ask ? when psychoanalyst @entity5 posed this question to hundreds of women in an online survey that began in 2006 , she was surprised by their answers : half of the respondents wanted to know more about their mothers ' sexuality			1
the queries ranged from the seemingly straightforward to the profound : " did she date other men before my dad ? " " had she had an abortion ? " " why did she have an affair ? " in her new book , " your daughter 's bedroom , " @entity5 explores the great value in sharing these kinds of intimate secrets -- even when it 's awkward to do so			1
@entity0 : how to get your daughter to talk to you understanding our mothers , she says , is vital to understanding ourselves			1
we asked @entity5 how to get the conversation started			1
q : why are these discussions so hard ? it 's not easy to blurt out the private details of your life to anyone			0
but moms often do n't discuss their sexual pasts because they 're embarrassed about things that happened , or worried they 'll scare their daughters			1
the daughters then withhold from their moms for fear of being judged			1
we 're not allowing ourselves to be real , whole women together			1
@entity0 : 14 really good sex questions q : what are we missing out on ? we lose our moms as advisers , for one			2
intimate relationships are bafflingly complex , and when things go wrong , many women consider themselves failures			1
but if they could talk about it , they might be able to move past that shame			0
q : what were your survey respondents hoping to learn about their moms ? many were hoping that certain aspects of their mothers ' personalities might be illuminated			1
they said things like " i think she must have been abused " and " i have to assume she was sexually unhappy with my father			2
" they wanted to get to know their mothers better as women , because we look to our moms as guides			1
we study them all the time as we grapple with our own identity			1
@entity0 : what is your daughter thinking ? q : any advice on approaching @entity90 ? make sure you consider the risks first , because you may learn things that you 're not prepared to know			1
if you feel ready , try looking for conversation starters in your everyday life -- like a movie that touched on sexual relationships or a friend who is going through a divorce			0
i find that mothers are often happy to talk once their daughters give them an opening			2
@entity0 : the " eew " factor q : how did you start talking about sex with your own daughter ? when she was little , i made sure she knew the correct names of her body parts			0
i did n't know what a vulva was till i was , like , 30			2
q : now that she 's a teenager , has it become more difficult ? she comes to me with questions , but there are definitely topics i have to broach			0
before she started high school , i said , " we 're going to have a conversation about oral sex			2
" and she said , " i 'm going to jump out of this car			0
" but i made the conversation happen			0
it 's my responsibility to teach her			0
