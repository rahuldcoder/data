-- @entity2 champions @entity1 began 2011 with an 11th successive league victory on sunday night to move five points clear of title rivals @entity5			1
young winger @entity6 , standing in for the absent @entity7 , scored both goals in the 2 - 1 victory over @entity10 while @entity12 winner @entity11 equaled the @entity15 club 's all - time appearance record of 549 matches			1
after a scoreless first half in which @entity1 struggled to break down the @entity20 side 's defense , @entity6 broke the deadlock two minutes into the second period as he did well to make space inside the penalty and fire in a deflected low shot from @entity27 ' agonizingly delayed pass			1
with @entity7 allowed to take an extended winter holiday , the 23 - year - old continued to make the most of his starting chance by adding his eight league goal this season in the 59th minute after @entity35 right - back @entity27 delivered a better - judged low cross into his path			0
@entity7 to miss @entity1 's 2011 opener @entity1 coach @entity39 was also without the services of injured captain @entity41 and the suspended @entity42 , and his depleted defense had to withstand a determined @entity10 fightback after @entity46 's superb left - foot volley reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go			1
the 30 - year - old @entity11 , who made an all - @entity1 three - man shortlist for the @entity50 award to be named this month , matched the milestone set by defender @entity52 20 years ago			1
" it is an honor for @entity11 , a home - bred player , to have worn the @entity1 shirt so many times , " club president @entity53 said			2
" @entity11 has won everything and he represents the @entity1 values : effort , loyalty , work and heart			2
loyalty is a difficult value to find , and what @entity11 has done for @entity1 is extraordinary			0
" @entity10 , who have not beaten @entity1 in six visits to the @entity69 , remained just two points above the relegation despite a marked improvement on the team 's last outing of 2010 -- an 8 - 0 drubbing by @entity5 in the first leg of their last - 16 @entity78 tie			1
@entity2 league strike called off second - placed @entity5 will be boosted by the long - awaited return of @entity35 midfielder @entity81 for monday night 's derby with city rivals @entity83			1
@entity81 , the second-most expensive signing in the @entity5 squad behind @entity86 , has been sidelined since requiring knee surgery in early august before the start of this season			2
" @entity81 wo n't start , he ca n't yet			0
he can give us 15 or 20 minutes of his very great quality , but no more , " coach @entity92 told reporters on sunday			0
in the day 's other 17th - round matches , @entity20 consolidated fourth place with a controversial 2 - 1 win over fellow @entity98 hopefuls @entity97 , despite having striker @entity100 sent off in the 61st minute for hitting @entity101 with a flailing arm			1
@entity100 scored his seventh league goal this season and his 11th overall to put the home side ahead in the 29th minute , but fifth - placed @entity97 leveled when @entity108 defender @entity107 inexplicably stooped to head @entity110 's innocuous cross into his own net in first - half injury time			2
@entity97 could not take advantage of their numerical advantage , and @entity115 nodded the winner in the second minute of time added on despite being in an offside position when @entity107 headed the ball across the goal			0
@entity121 seek to revive their own @entity123 qualification bid with a 1 - 0 victory at home to @entity126 that lifted the club into ninth place -- 23 points behind @entity1			2
striker @entity130 scored the only goal in the 36th minute as he raced to the near post to head in a freekick from @entity134			0
the defeat left @entity126 in 15th place , four points above the bottom three			0
@entity139 moved up to 11th place with a 2 - 1 victory at nine - man @entity142 , who stayed eighth			1
forward @entity145 scored in each half for the visitors , the first from the penalty spot on 22 minutes and the second seven minutes after the break			0
both teams were reduced to 10 men by the end of the first period , with @entity142 defender @entity155 receiving a straight red card on 35 and @entity139 midfielder @entity157 also sent off for a second booking just before the interval			0
striker @entity160 reduced the deficit with four minutes to play with his 11th @entity163 strike , but his teammate @entity164 was also marched for a second yellow card at the end			0
@entity167 moved out of the relegation zone with a 2 - 1 win at second - bottom @entity170 , coming from behind with goals from defender @entity172 and midfielder @entity173 , who netted a 59th - minute penalty .			1
