-- the @entity6 case of a trooper ticketing a @entity9 police officer in his squad car for driving 120 miles per hour " is a simple misunderstanding that has been blown out of proportion , " the officer 's attorney said friday			1
officer @entity11 , 35 , of @entity9 was handcuffed at gunpoint last month and charged with second - degree reckless driving , a misdemeanor , according to the @entity15			1
@entity11 , who was speeding on the @entity17 , was released shortly after , authorities said			2
@entity11 was accused of weaving his marked police car through traffic at more than 120 miles an hour so he could be on time for his off - duty job , authorities said			1
he led @entity6 trooper @entity24 on a seven - minute , nearly 12 - mile chase in the predawn darkness of october 11 , a highway patrol report said			0
" it was an unfortunate situation that happened , and although officer @entity11 may have been going too fast , the @entity15 trooper clearly overreacted , " @entity27 , @entity11 's attorney , told @entity0			1
" this matter was very much blown out of proportion			2
" " officer @entity34 is a good police officer who has worked as a uniform patrol officer on the streets of @entity9 for nearly six years , protecting the citizens of @entity9 , " @entity27 said separately in a statement			2
" the allegation that he was driving his police vehicle 120 mph is not accurate and is disputed			1
he was not driving recklessly , and a review of the videotape shows he was not driving recklessly			0
" meanwhile , the highway patrol released the audio recording of the dispatch call made by state trooper @entity47 as she pursued @entity11 on the @entity17 , also @entity49 91 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity50			2

i 'm on 91 almost to @entity53			0
he 's well over 120 and he 's not stopping , " @entity24 said			0

it would be a @entity9 or @entity68 , and i 'm sure it 's not @entity68 , " she said to the dispatcher			0
then an unidentified person on the radio tells @entity24 : " if they tell you it 's a patrol car , just have her back off			0
" @entity24 was driving on the turnpike when the white marked @entity9 police car blew by and " crossed over all lanes of traffic , " according to the state highway patrol report			2
she could n't overtake the @entity9 police car " due to the unit traveling extremely reckless , in and out of traffic at high rates of speed , in excess of 120 mph , " according to the report			1
the @entity9 officer ignored the state patrol officer 's siren and lights -- and even " accelerated " at times and continued changing lanes , the report said			1
