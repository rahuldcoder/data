-- the life of rugby player @entity2 is the stuff films are made of -- literally			1
the 43 - year - old was part of the @entity7 team which won rugby union 's @entity8 on home soil in 1995 and received the trophy from the late president @entity12 as the post-apartheid era dawned			1

@entity15 was diagnosed with motor neurone disease , also known as @entity25 , in 2011			1
the man that famously muscled @entity30 rugby giant @entity28 to the turf in the closely - fought 1995 @entity8 final now uses a wheelchair to get around			2
his body is too frail to walk because the debilitating disease effects all physical movement , including speech			2
and the light and shade between his former glories and his present battle with illness is not unsurprisingly proving frustrating			0
" it is , " @entity14 der @entity15 told @entity0 's @entity7 correspondent @entity43 in a television interview where @entity14 der @entity15 's slurred speech has been subtitled			1

when he retired in 2003 , he was the country 's most capped player with a reputation as one of the most brilliant , and toughest , scrum halves in the history of the game			1
@entity62 , who captained @entity7 to success in 1995 , described @entity15 as " a phenomenal athlete			2
" " what @entity65 did on the rugby field was incredible , " @entity62 told @entity0			0
" he was probably the best number nine to play the game , and that 's saying something			0
" tough and tenacious on the rugby field , @entity15 is having to apply those skills in his fight to stay alive and help find a cure for motor neurone disease			1
" i am , " he assured @entity0			0
i am a self - confessed bad loser and i want to beat this not just for myself but for everyone with @entity25 around the world			0
" @entity15 has started a foundation called @entity83 to raise money and awareness of motor neurone disease			1
the foundation offers support and advice to patients and their families as they come to terms with a disease which has no clear cause			2
a @entity83 legends team -- boasting over 500 international caps between them -- was cheered on by @entity15 in the veterans ' tournament at november 's @entity100 round of the @entity101			1

" it is for this reason that @entity14 der @entity15 has revealed that he has decided to be artificially ventilated when his lungs are no longer able to function on their own			0
