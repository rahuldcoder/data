the @entity1 - led coalition intensified its airstrikes on @entity4 targets in @entity5 and @entity6 -- but that may not be enough to stop the terror group 's bloody march			1
@entity4 is closing in on the key @entity5 @entity13 city of @entity14 near the @entity16 border , a civilian inside the city told @entity17			1
the terror group is 3 kilometers ( nearly 2 miles ) east of @entity14 , the civilian said on the condition of anonymity , basically confirming a report from the @entity23 - based monitoring group , the @entity22			1
if @entity4 takes @entity14 , it would control a complete swath of land from its self - declared capital of @entity28 to the @entity16 border , more than 100 kilometers ( more than 60 miles ) away			1
residents of @entity14 said they felt helpless , and terrified			2
despite airstrikes in the area , witnesses said the attacks are too few and too far back from the front lines to slow the momentum of the terror group			0
we need more effective airstrikes , " @entity14 official @entity39 said			2
" if the situation stays like this , we will see a massacre			1
i ca n't imagine what will happen if @entity4 gets inside @entity14			1
" the @entity22 , whose information comes from a well - established network of activists , doctors and civilians across parts of @entity5 , said monday that @entity4 fighters were about 5 kilometers to the east and southeast of @entity14 , also known as @entity55			1
" my question is : why do n't you attack @entity4 near @entity14 , " said @entity56 , founder and director of the observatory			1
@entity1 claims successes the @entity1 military believes the ongoing bombing campaign in @entity5 has degraded @entity4 command and control capabilities , according to a briefing to reporters by maj. gen. @entity67 , assistant deputy chief of staff for the @entity68			1
there is evidence that @entity4 is unable to amass troops , he said			2
the @entity68 reports that its f - 22s are achieving good results not just by dropping bombs , but by keeping an eye out for anything being fired from the ground			0
about three - fourths of the airstrikes in @entity6 have been carried out by the @entity68 , which is also responsible for about half of the strikes in @entity5			2
the latest attacks so far , the @entity1 and allies have conducted at least 229 airstrikes in @entity6 and 59 airstrikes in @entity5			1
over the weekend , @entity87 and the @entity88 joined the @entity1 in pummeling @entity4 targets in @entity5 , @entity86 said			1
those attacks took out armed vehicles and also hit four @entity4 - controlled modular refineries and an @entity4 command - and - control node north of the stronghold of @entity28 , the @entity1 military said			2
on sunday night , @entity1 military forces targeted to an @entity4 - held grain storage facility near @entity97 , @entity86 said			2
the facility was being used by @entity4 as a logistics hub and vehicle staging facility , it said			0
@entity101 of the @entity5 observatory said the strikes in @entity97 killed at least two workers at the grain silos			0
" we are aware of media reports alleging civilian casualties , but have no evidence to corroborate these claims , " said col. @entity106 , director , @entity107 at the @entity86			0
" i can assure you that before any mission , every precaution is taken to ensure we do not harm civilians or civilian facilities			0
however , we take all such reports seriously and will look into them further			0
" separately a second @entity1 official confirms they are looking into a small number of civilian casualties at one targeted site			2
on the @entity6 side of the border , fighter jets and drones conducted at least four airstrikes over the weekend : one near @entity128 that destroyed an @entity4 safe house and three near @entity130 that destroyed two @entity4 checkpoints and a transport vehicle , the @entity1 military said			1
@entity5 deputy prime minister at @entity136 meanwhile @entity5 is lashing out at what it calls @entity1 double standards			2
the @entity5 deputy prime minister spoke before the @entity141 monday , and said supporting the so - called moderate @entity5 with money , weapons and training would only make the situation worse			2
" this is a real recipe for the increase of violence and terrorism , and the bloodshed -- and @entity5 bloodshed and prolonging the @entity5 crisis and demolishing the political solution , " @entity144 said			0
" this behavior creates a fertile ground for the growth of those terrorist groups that commit the most heinous crimes on @entity5 territories , which requires all of us to seriously and effectively address and eradicate this terrorism , in order to re-establish security and stability in @entity5 and the region			0
" @entity144 urged the international community to pool efforts to combat terrorism			0
@entity168 : we underestimated @entity4 in an interview that aired sunday on @entity172 ' " @entity171 , " president @entity168 said the @entity1 government " underestimated what had been taking place in @entity5 " during its civil war -- allowing the country to become " ground zero for jihadists around the world			1
" " over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the @entity5 civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , " @entity168 said			2
another shortcoming was overestimating @entity6 's security forces , which were quickly overrun by @entity4 when it took over @entity6 's second - largest city of @entity195 , @entity168 said			1
in recent weeks , @entity168 has been trying to boost an international coalition to fight @entity4 in both @entity5 and @entity6			1
despite the @entity1 initially overestimating @entity6 's military , " this is @entity1 leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with , to make sure that they are able to take care of their business , " @entity168 told " 60 minutes			1
" " if we do our job right and the @entity6 fight , then over time our role can slow down and taper off			0
" @entity4 militant : airstrikes do n't really hurt us in an exclusive interview with @entity17 , @entity5 @entity4 fighter @entity212 said the militant group had prepared for the @entity1 - led airstrikes			1
" we 've been ready for this for some time , " @entity212 said			0
" we know that our bases are known because they 're tracking us with radars and satellites , so we had backup locations			0
" one man who recently defected from @entity4 said part of the group 's strategy was to hide its resources in civilian areas			0
" they almost entirely emptied out the headquarters , " the defector , @entity227 , told @entity17 's @entity228 after he fled to @entity16			0
" some equipment they hid in civilian neighborhoods			0
" @entity227 also said @entity4 relies heavily on foreign fighters , including @entity236			0
" the @entity239 , they have so much control -- they 're even more extreme than we are , " the defector said			0
" they come from @entity239 , but it 's as if they have been part of the @entity247 for years			0
" @entity17 exclusive : @entity4 fighter says @entity1 airstrikes not effective what @entity1 think according to a new @entity17 / @entity252 poll , 73 % percent of @entity1 support the @entity1 - led coalition of airstrikes in @entity6 and @entity5 -- and most believe @entity4 poses some level of threat to the @entity1			1
but a majority -- 60 % -- also oppose sending ground troops in the fight			0
