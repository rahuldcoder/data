@entity1 's top rescue official says authorities believe the missing @entity4 jet is likely at the bottom of the sea , based on radar data from the plane 's last contact			1
" ( because ) the coordinate that was given to us and the evolution from the calculation point of the flight track is at sea , our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea , " @entity10 , head of @entity1 's national search and rescue agency , told reporters monday			1
but searchers still do n't know where the plane is , he said , and may need help from other countries for help with an underwater search			1
the search for @entity30 resumed on monday , a day after the commercial jet disappeared in @entity33 airspace with 162 people aboard			1
ships , planes and helicopters are looking for the missing aircraft , @entity33 authorities said			1
it 's unclear if weather played a role in the aircraft 's disappearance , but rescuers say it could be a factor that influences how quickly they find the plane			1
large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on sunday , the agency said			1
by monday morning , weather in the area appeared to be clearing up , @entity55 meteorologist @entity54 said			1
authorities say they 're combing a " very broad search area			1
" @entity4 says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 7:24 a.m. sunday @entity63 time ( 6:24 a.m. in @entity1 )			1
the missing plane , flying from the @entity33 city of @entity66 to @entity63 , went missing as it flew over the @entity67 between the islands of @entity69 and @entity70 -- a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters , according to @entity33 authorities , who are leading the search and rescue operations			1
before the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers , one of the pilots asked to fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather , officials said			1
@entity4 statement on missing airliner in addition to @entity1 's teams , several other countries have joined the hunt for the missing plane			1
a c - 130 plane from @entity63 has been participating in the search , and the country 's military says it 's sending two more ships to the search area			1
@entity98 's transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search			2
and the @entity103 said monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help			2
and @entity1 has reached out to the @entity105 , @entity106 and the @entity107 for help with sonar technology that may be needed for an underwater search , @entity10 told reporters monday			1
now that a day has passed since the plane went missing , investigators should have more data to help them find it , said @entity116 , former managing director of the @entity117			1
" they 've had a full 24 hours now to gather all of the available radar data from all of the available sources , " he said			0
" they should be able to put that together , along with any satellite data , and have a more precise location on where to target their search			2
" waiting and weeping after hours of waiting in anguish for any word about the passengers aboard the missing plane , several dozen of their family members met with airport and airline officials in a closed - door briefing monday at the airport in @entity66			1
as they waited for news before the briefing , some took cell phone pictures of a flight manifest posted on a wall			0
the black - and - white papers showed every passenger 's name and seat number , but not their fate			0
others simply sat and dabbed tears from their eyes			0
" our concern right now is for the relatives and the next of kin , " @entity4 ceo @entity154 said during a news conference in @entity66			0
he confirmed that storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a change in flight plan , but added , " we do n't want to speculate whether weather was a factor			2
we really do n't know			0
" once the aircraft is found , there will be a proper investigation , @entity154 said			0
of the people on board the @entity171 , 155 are @entity33 , three are @entity172 , one is @entity105 , one is @entity106 , one is @entity98 and one is @entity63 , the airline said			1
eighteen children , including one infant , are among the passengers , the carrier said			2
seven of the people on board are crew members			2
families of @entity4 flight passengers given support through the ' nightmare ' questions over pilots ' communications @entity195 " was requesting deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost , " the airline said			1
the flight 's captain asked permission to climb to a higher altitude , the @entity201 's acting director general for air transportation affairs , @entity200 , said , according to the national news agency			0
according to flight tracking websites , almost the entire flight path of the plane was over the sea			1
what role did weather play ? @entity55 aviation analyst @entity210 said that if there was an onboard emergency , the pilots should have issued a mayday call or a pan-pan call			1
" @entity217 means you 're immediately in danger of losing the flight ; pan-pan means that it is urgent but that you can continue the flight and request an alternate route or an alternate airport , " said @entity210 , a former inspector general for the @entity107 @entity216			2
" it 's disconcerting in that the standard procedures for an emergency do n't seem to have been deployed , " she said			0
but @entity229 , a former @entity103 and @entity117 accident investigator , said pilots do n't always make mayday calls in an emergency			0
" you know that the controllers ca n't really help you , " he told @entity55			1
" you and your co-pilot are going to have to solve this			0
" it 's too soon to know what happened to the missing plane , he said			1
details released so far show some similarities , @entity242 said , with an air algerie flight that disintegrated and crashed in july after changing its flight path because of bad weather			2
but there 's also a chance that the @entity4 flight did n't crash after losing contact with air traffic control , he said			0
the @entity171 is equipped with a ditching switch , @entity242 said , that essentially turns the plane 's fuselage into a boat			2
" if they got the aircraft down on the water safely , " he said , " it should be floating			0
" ' very good ' safety reputation as word spread of the missing plane , the airline changed the color of its logo on its website and social media accounts from red to gray			1
@entity1 's president @entity269 said his nation was " praying for the safety " of those on board			2
pope @entity274 also prayed for the missing , according to @entity276			2
@entity4 is a @entity98 - based airline that is popular in the region as a budget carrier			0
it travels to about 100 destinations , with affiliate companies in several @entity282 countries			0
the missing plane is operated by @entity4 's @entity33 affiliate , in which the @entity98 company holds a 48.9 % stake , according to its website			1
@entity4 has a " very good " reputation for safety , @entity55 aviation correspondent @entity288 said			2
flight 8501 's captain has a total of 20,537 flying hours , with 6,100 of them with @entity1 on the @entity171 , the airline said			1
the first officer has a total of 2,275 flying hours , @entity4 said			0
the plane 's last scheduled maintenance was on november 16 , it said			0
the @entity301 said the first officer is the @entity106 citizen who is on the plane			0

@entity171 said the plane had " accumulated approximately 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights			0
" the aircraft manufacturer said it would provide full assistance to authorities in charge of investigating the missing plane			2
the loss of contact with the @entity4 plane comes nearly 10 months after the disappearance of @entity321 , which dropped off radar over @entity323 on march 8 with 239 people on board			0
the @entity327 plane , a @entity326 , lost contact with air traffic control over the @entity330 between @entity98 and @entity331			0
searchers have yet to find any debris from flight 370 , which officials believe crashed in the southern @entity336 after veering dramatically off course			0
but some aviation experts do n't think the search for @entity195 will be as grueling as the search for @entity321			0
" we are not talking about the deep @entity336 here , " @entity288 said			0
" we are talking about congested airspace around @entity323			0
there will be much better radar coverage			0
there 's certainly better air traffic control coverage			0
