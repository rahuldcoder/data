-- with tuesday 's unveiling of the @entity3 and a fourth - generation full - sized @entity3 , this has been a major week for the @entity3			2
on friday , @entity4 went on sale — making it an even bigger week for @entity6 but this newsiest of tech news weeks also turns out to be a reasonably significant one for the @entity8 of @entity10 's tuesday event was devoted to new models , including a substantial overhaul of the 13 ″ @entity13 with a @entity14 , two absurdly thin new imacs and an updated @entity16			1
the profusion of new models was good news for @entity21 fans who have been known to fret that the @entity21 is being neglected as the @entity22 and @entity3 become ever more important to @entity10 's bottom line and future			1
as usual , @entity10 teed off its announcements with happy recent stats			1
i was aware that the @entity21 has outpaced the rest of the @entity30 industry in sales growth for years , but i did n't know that the @entity13 is the best - selling notebook line in the @entity32 , and the @entity33 is the best - selling desktop			1
those achievements are more evidence that @entity10 's @entity21 strategy — build premium machines , sell them profitably and do n't obsess over market share — does n't mean that it ca n't end up with impressive market share anyhow			1
after the tuesday presentation , i sat down with @entity10 senior vp of worldwide marketing @entity41 , who did the presenting of new models on tuesday , and chatted with him about today 's @entity21 , and how they got that way			1
i began by asking him about the streamlining of @entity21 hardware that 's been going on for years now			1
@entity10 has put its computers into unibody cases , sealed in the batteries , removed the optical drives , dumped hard disks when possible and either shrunk or eliminated many once - standard connectors			1
rather than adding new features with abandon , as tech companies usually do , it 's whittled the @entity21 down to its elegant essence			1
many of these changes have been controversial , at least briefly , at least among some observers			0
but they do n't seem to have hurt @entity21 sales			1
what was the overarching strategy , i asked ? " this is what @entity10 has always been about , and the @entity21 has been about , from the first @entity21 and first @entity33 , " @entity41 said			1
" it 's always been about making the best @entity21 we know how			1
among the many benefits are making it easy to use and affordable , with great features			2
this high level of integration is part of delivering on that			0
" @entity41 pointed out some of the downsides of the technologies it 's removed or downplayed : rotating hard disks , for instance , use more power and are more likely to have reliability issues than solid - state storage			1
" these old technologies are holding us back , " he said			1
" they 're anchors on where we want to go			1
" " we find the things that have outlived their useful purpose			0
our competitors are afraid to remove them			0
we try to find better solutions — our customers have given us a lot of trust			0
" @entity10 began removing dvd burners from portable computers , where weight and thinness are paramount — at least to @entity10 — years ago			1
but the new imacs are the first ones without optical drives			0
i asked @entity41 if that was a more difficult decision			1
" it actually comes from similar thinking as with the portables , " @entity41 said			2
" in general , it 's a good idea to remove these rotating medias from our computers and other devices			2
they have inherent issues — they 're mechanical and sometimes break , they use power and are large			2
we can create products that are smaller , lighter and consume less power			0
" @entity41 pointed out that one major application for optical drives , software distribution , has gone largely digital			2
as for video , he said that " blu - ray has come with issues unrelated to the actual quality of the movie that make [ it ] a complex and not - great technology ... so for a whole plethora of reasons , it makes a lot of sense to get rid of optical discs in desktops and notebooks			0
" his preferred @entity137 ? @entity138 , of course , which lets you buy a movie and then watch it on all your @entity10 devices			2
@entity144 , people assumed that @entity21 ' lack of @entity123 was a delay , not a permanent decision to fast - forward past it			2
i told @entity41 that i imagined folks do n't ask about it much these days			2
" correct , " he said			0
i noted that for years , pundits thought @entity10 would , or at least should , start making much cheaper @entity21			1
i said that drumbeat seems to have come and gone , and asked @entity41 if everyone finally understood that @entity10 was content with its strategy of sticking with the high end of the market			1
" our approach at @entity10 has always been to make products we 're proud to own and use ourselves , " he told me			1
" ... we would n't make something cheap or low quality			0
when the economy is difficult , people care a great deal about the things they spend their money on			0
customers have come to understand that @entity10 's products are n't priced high — they 're priced on the value of what we build into them			1
" " there 's something that happened in the industry ... that made that topic meaningless			2
there were these products being created called netbooks			0
people said they were the future			0
we rejected them because we thought they were poor			0
even if the market was going there , we were n't going to chase everybody downhill			0
" netbooks eventually turned out to be a fad			0
and of course , @entity10 was working on a lower - cost computing device			2
" the @entity3 became our answer to the $ 500 computer			0
@entity193 has proved us right on that point			0
and now 100 million people agree that the @entity3 is a great computer			0
" oh yeah : i would n't be an inquiring reporter if i had n't asked @entity41 for his take on @entity4 and @entity200 's strategy of building one operating system for both conventional pcs and tablets			1
he politely declined comment : " primarily , we think about what we 're doing , not what others do			0
" at least i tried			0
