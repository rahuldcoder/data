-- last week @entity2 president @entity1 officially submitted the statehood request asking that the @entity4 recognize " @entity6 " as an independent state			1
but while @entity1 's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at the @entity12 , the @entity7 has already promised it will veto the @entity2 statehood bid at a @entity15 meeting monday			1
why is this move happening now ? the @entity2 leadership says they are making the request for statehood now for a few reasons			2
firstly , they argue that over the course of the past two years the @entity2 has made great progress in building the infrastructure necessary for maintaining a sovereign state			0
they point to the various improvements in governance , security , and physical infrastructure as indicators of their readiness			0
palestinians also point to the september 2011 date that @entity7 president @entity37 laid out over a year ago as the deadline for the successful negotiation with @entity40 for a two - state solution			2
the quartet of @entity44 peace , made up of the @entity4 , @entity45 , @entity46 , and the @entity7 also set this month as the target date for a negotiated deal			2
with that deadline not having been met @entity2 leaders argue that that the best way to enhance the chances for peace moving forward is for international recognition of a @entity2 state			1
who is agreeing with the @entity35 ' demand , and who is disagreeing ? in the 15 - member @entity15 , the one body that can confer full @entity4 membership , the @entity35 enjoy the support of a majority of the countries			2
but the @entity7 , which as one of the five permanent members holds veto power , has pledged it will vote down the statehood bid , ending the @entity35 ' chance to win full membership			1
in the @entity12 , where a vote would be non-binding , the @entity35 enjoy the support of more than 120 of the 193 members and passage of a statehood resolution would be all but assured			0
why do the @entity7 and @entity40 oppose the call ? both the @entity7 and @entity40 consider the @entity2 strategy a unilateral move that will only hinder the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement to the @entity44 conflict			1
@entity4 action , both countries argue , does not take the place of direct negotiations			0
speaking recently to reporters , @entity7 secretary of state @entity83 said : " we believe strongly that the road to peace and two states living side by side does not go through @entity89 , it goes through @entity90 and @entity91			0
" @entity40 calls for peace talks amid @entity2 statehood push surely , if the @entity7 and @entity40 do n't agree then it wo n't mean any difference on the ground ? without the acknowledgement of @entity40 and the @entity7 , @entity4 recognition of a @entity2 state based on armistice lines that existed before 1967 is largely a symbolic move			1
@entity40 prime minister @entity102 has rejected these lines as the basis for a @entity2 state , calling them " indefensible			1
" therefore the borders , airspace , and movement of people in a new " @entity6 " would continue to be controlled by the @entity40 military and it would be unlikely to change the presence of about 300,000 @entity40 settlers in the @entity114			0
if a @entity2 state is recognized , what could that mean for relations / negotiations with @entity40 ? many believe recognition of a @entity2 state would exacerbate already poor relations between the @entity2 government and @entity40			1
some politicians in @entity40 have called for unilateral responses to the @entity2 bid including the outright annexation of territory in the @entity114 , the withholding of tax revenue collected on behalf of the @entity35 , and the cancellation of various parts of the 1993 @entity134 accords that created the @entity2			1
potential moves like this and what some believe could be a rising level of @entity2 frustration at unmet expectations could add a great deal of tension on the ground and contribute to the possibility of an outbreak of violence			0
@entity2 leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on @entity40 to be more reasonable in future negotiations			2
is there risk in this move for the @entity2 ? beyond the potential response from @entity40 , the @entity2 bid at the @entity4 is risky			1
the @entity7 is opposed to the move and lawmakers in congress have threatened to pull the plug on hundreds of millions of dollars in annual @entity7 aid			0
others say the move will unrealistically raise expectations of @entity35 and , if little actually changes on the ground , could contribute to regional tensions			0
the @entity2 could also risk losing support from its own people			0
the @entity170 political faction , which controls @entity171 , does not support the @entity4 strategy and there are concerns among the @entity2 refugees in the region that the statehood bid could compromise their " right of return " to their homeland			1
would @entity4 recognition give the @entity35 anything substantive ? recognition by the @entity4 could potentially give @entity35 greater access to international bodies like the @entity185 and the @entity186			1
venues like these could serve as a place for @entity35 to file legal challenges to @entity40 practices and exert more international pressure on @entity40			0
what 's the current state of negotiations between @entity40 and the @entity35 ? currently there are no talks going on between @entity40 and @entity35			2
talks fell apart a year ago over disagreements on the issue of @entity40 @entity114 settlements			0
coming off a self - imposed 10 - month halt in settlement construction , @entity40 said it would not renew the freeze			0
this led the @entity35 to quit the negotiations			0
in an effort to head off the @entity35 's statehood request at the @entity4 the @entity7 and various @entity207 countries have been engaged in 11th hour diplomacy to get the talks restarted but few expect a breakthrough deal .			1

@entity35 request @entity4 recognition of " @entity6 " as new member state
@entity7 holds veto power , has pledged to vote down statehood bid
@entity40 @entity221 has rejected pre- 1967 border lines as basis for @entity2 state
many believe move may worsen relations between @entity2 and @entity40
