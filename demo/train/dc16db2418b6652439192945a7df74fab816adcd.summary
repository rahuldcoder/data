@entity0 -- before leaving @entity0 to concentrate efforts on their re-election campaigns , @entity3 senators voted saturday to fund the federal government into 2013 and passed a measure asserting a tough stance towards @entity9 over its nuclear program			1
in a 62 to 30 vote in a session that stretched past midnight , the legislators approved the moneys necessary for government to function for the next six months and avoided a possible shutdown until early next year - thus forgoing any partisan funding standoff well past november 's election date			0
the bill will go to president @entity20 for its anticipated signature into law			0
in a bipartisan show of steadfastness on @entity9 , @entity23 passed a non-binding resolution - nearly unanimously - for the @entity3 to pursue a policy other than containment , if necessary to prevent @entity9 from acquiring nuclear weapons			2
@entity30 41 advises that time is running out on diplomacy , and it " rejects any @entity3 policy that would rely on efforts to contain a nuclear weapons - capable @entity9			2
" the bill reflects and supports president @entity20 's existing stance			0
it passed with only one vote against it , that of @entity42 senator @entity41 from @entity43			1
" a vote for this resolution is a vote for the concept of preemptive war , " @entity41 objected in his arguments before the @entity30 preceding the roll call ballot			0
the bill text ended with the statement : " nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of war			0
" @entity41 found himself at odds with senators from both parties a second time in the late - night session , when legislators from both parties in a 81 to 10 vote handily rejected a bill , which the @entity43 senator had sponsored , to strip perceived uncooperative @entity68 countries of @entity3 foreign aid			1
under the measure , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- nations @entity41 argues have not been willing partners in the war on terror -- would have lost @entity3 support			1
several @entity42 senators had spoken out against @entity41 's measure saying now is not the time to take the funds from countries with nascent governments that could be important partners with the @entity3 in the future .			2
