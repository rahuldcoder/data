-- @entity3 's unbeaten @entity2 run came to an end on monday as @entity5 blew the @entity7 title race wide open with a 2 - 1 victory at home to their 10 - man opponents			1
@entity3 traveled to @entity12 seeking to re-establish a five - point lead over local rivals @entity14 , and made the perfect start when @entity16 scored in just the second minute			1
but @entity17 equalized in the pouring rain on 34 , and the visitors had defender @entity20 sent off for second booking just before the hour mark			1
substitute @entity23 then condemned @entity25 's men to a first defeat in 15 league games with an 83rd - minute penalty that lifted @entity5 up to third place above @entity12 rivals @entity30 on goal difference			1
is @entity25 the right man for @entity3 ? " the @entity5 players after the game were really happy to beat us			1
that shows we are a top team at this moment and that all the teams want to beat us , and this is important for us , " manager @entity25 said			0
" we worked well up to now and now we should continue			0
i hope that we can go another 14 games without losing			0
" @entity3 went into the game having been eliminated from the @entity42 at the group stage despite beating @entity44 in wednesday 's final game			2
@entity16 was caught breaking a club curfew before this match , but the @entity49 striker showed his undoubted on - field class with the opening goal -- his 11th this season			0
@entity53 showed great skill to turn inside @entity5 captain @entity55 and thread a perfect pass for the 21 - year - old , who held off @entity60 and coolly slotted past goalkeeper @entity61 for his eighth in the league			0
@entity5 's @entity64 to join @entity66 club @entity3 could have had a 14th - minute penalty when @entity68 appeared to bring down @entity69 , but the referee decided otherwise in a decision which manager @entity25 later said was the turning point in the match			1
@entity5 went through to the last 16 of the @entity42 last week with an emphatic win over @entity75 which relieved the pressure on manager @entity77			0
however , he was on the defensive after that victory and accused the media of unfair treatment -- being unhappy with criticism of the form that left @entity5 10 points adrift of @entity3 going into monday 's match			1
the return to form shown against the @entity88 continued as young striker @entity89 gathered a superb long pass from @entity55 and raced past @entity20 down the left before cutting back to @entity17 , and the @entity93 midfielder volleyed the equalizer			2
@entity20 's night ended in the 58th minute when the @entity98 international fouled @entity96 midfielder @entity95 , and @entity5 made full use of their extra man			1
@entity101 double ends @entity30 's winning run the 22 - year - old @entity89 , who made his @entity104 debut last month , fired in a left - foot shot that struck the raised arm of @entity3 defender @entity107			2
veteran midfielder @entity23 , who sat out last tuesday 's @entity109 game and this time came on to replace @entity17 in the 73rd minute , stepped up and smashed the resulting penalty past @entity104 goalkeeper @entity112			1
" i went out and missed a penalty a few weeks ago and the next one is always hard to take , " he said			0
" you 've got to be big enough and stand up and take them , and they 're the moments			0
i was very relieved when it hit the back of the net			0
" the defeat means @entity3 can lose the lead on sunday when @entity14 travel to @entity125 in the early match , then @entity25 's side face another big test against in - form @entity128 at the @entity129 later that day			2
@entity5 joined @entity30 on 31 points , having played one more game ahead of their clash on december 22 -- which follows saturday 's trip to lowly @entity134 " our objective was to shorten the distance to the leaders today , and we managed to do exactly that , but we do n't take extra flavor from being the first team to beat them , " @entity77 said			2
" we needed to do our job to get our challenge back on track , and i think it 's pretty much alive now			0
