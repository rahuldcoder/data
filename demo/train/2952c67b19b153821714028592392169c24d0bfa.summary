-- @entity1 turns 10 saturday , a decade during which the globally crowdsourced online encyclopedia weathered fierce criticism about its reliability and banishment from academia			1
at the same time , it 's so popular it turns up pretty consistently in the top 10 @entity10 results for nearly any search			1
in a wide - ranging interview with @entity14 , founder @entity12 talks about censorship , staying relevant , and why nothing keeps him awake at night			1
@entity14 : did you ever think @entity1 would be as big as it is , 10 years ago ? @entity12 : i remember looking at a list of the top 100 websites and seeing an encyclopedia reference - style site ranked around number 50 and thinking that if we did a really good job we could be in the top 100 or maybe even top 50			1
but today @entity1 is the fifth most popular website in the world			1
what has been the biggest challenge over the last 10 years ? i would say that the biggest challenge has been dealing with the growth , and particularly in building an organization behind @entity1 that is as strong as @entity1 itself			1
hiring @entity35 to run the @entity36 was one of the best things we ever did			2
what has been the biggest surprise for you ? although i always wanted @entity1 to be global , i think i never really grasped what that would mean for the project and for me personally			1
i never thought about how i might need to travel all over the world to meet people			2
do you get tired of defending the integrity of @entity1 articles ? how do you counter the criticism ? no , i do n't really get tired of it , because i think that our responsibility to help make @entity1 as good as it possibly can be means that we have to take seriously every legitimate criticism and think about how we can improve			1
in terms of countering the criticism , i think that today most people understand that @entity1 is pretty good but not perfect , and that it is getting better all the time			1
it 's really important that our community remain steadfastly committed to taking quality really seriously			0
do you see a time when @entity1 could be a credible academic source ? i think it is already generally used and accepted far more in academia than any conventional encyclopedia ever was			1
what people sometimes forget is that citing [ @entity69 ] @entity68 in an academic paper is not what students should be doing , either			0
what are your main areas of focus at the moment ? i 'm focused increasingly on the growth of @entity1 in the developing world			1
we are experiencing a lot of growth in a lot of different places , and at the @entity36 it is a part of our five - year strategic vision to put resources behind assisting local communities grow and flourish in languages where we are currently small			0
we 're opening our first office outside the @entity89 this year , in @entity90 , and i 'm super excited about that			0
are there any legislative issues that threaten the @entity1 model ? i worry about censorship in many parts of the world			1
it 's a major human rights issue and one where we try to be at the forefront of terms of advocating for the free right to share information and learn from others			0
while i 'm optimistic about the direction the world is headed , generally , i think there is a need for constant vigilance and pressure on repressive governments			2
how did you know that people would give up their time and expertise to create the collaborative encyclopedia ? i always thought that people would contribute			2
i did n't know , before @entity1 , how to help them contribute , but a lot of my belief in @entity1 came from participating in some high - quality mailing lists where i met really smart people who were perfectly happy to share what they knew			1
how do you encourage a more - diverse range of contributors ? there are many ways to look at this ...			0
diversity across languages means that we need to look at technical and performance issues in various places around the world , and that we need to assist local communities with recruitment and publicity			2
diversity within the major languages is also desirable ? we want to make it easier for more people to edit ? people who are geeks but not necessarily computer geeks ! to what extent do you think @entity1 represents the best aspects ofthe web ? e.g. , democratization of information , power of the crowds ? to a very strong extent , i think that @entity1 shows a hopeful set of possibilities for the future			2
i 'm not a big fan of the terminology " crowds " in this context			0
i think it can be disrespectful to talk about communities in those terms			0
we are n't a crowd			0
we are thoughtful and noble individuals working together in peace and by choice for a common goal			0
how do you stay relevant ? we stay relevant mostly by sticking with intense passion to our mission - driven culture			0
we are here to provide a free , high - quality encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in their own language			2
it is a simple and powerful charitable mission			0
are you never tempted to take advertising ? if not , why not ? no , not at all			0
we like being supported by small donors			0
it 's good for @entity1 and good for the world			1
what keeps you awake at night ? my superpower is sleeping , so nothing really keeps me awake at night			0
where do you see @entity1 in 10 years ? more languages , more information , higher quality			1
