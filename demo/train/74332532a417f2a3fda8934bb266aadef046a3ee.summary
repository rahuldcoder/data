the trial of @entity1 , accused of killing his former girlfriend @entity2 , was postponed until april 7 because one of two assessors was hospitalized			1
the assessors will help the judge decide the verdict			0
@entity8 does not have jury trials			0
@entity1 killed @entity2 on @entity10 last year			1
of that , there is no doubt			0
but was it murder ? one of @entity8 's toughest prosecutors , @entity16 , has been fighting for most of this month to prove it was			2
on friday , one of the country 's shrewdest defense lawyers , @entity21 , was scheduled to begin convincing a judge that it was n't			1
now he will have to wait			0
the verdict will hinge on two questions : did the @entity27 sprinter know his girlfriend was behind the door in the bathroom of his house when he fired four hollow - point bullets through it in the middle of the night ? and if he did not -- if he thought she was a burglar , as he insists -- did he act as a reasonable person would have ? critical testimony will come from the only living person who was in the house at the time , the " @entity1 " himself			1
@entity1 was expected to take the stand for the first time friday to give his side of a story he 's been telling for more than a year			1
he woke up in the middle of the night , went to his balcony to bring in a fan -- or two fans , in his most recent version -- heard his bathroom window opening , took his gun , went to the bathroom and fired through the door when he heard a noise in the toilet			0
" it was pitch dark in the bedroom , and i thought @entity2 was in bed , " he testified when he applied for bail in the days after the killing			2
in that version of the story , @entity1 emphasized that he " felt a sense of terror " when he heard the noise , that he " felt extremely vulnerable " because he was not wearing his prosthetic legs , and that he " has been a victim of violence and of burglaries before			1
" and , he said , " we were deeply in love and i could not be happier			0
" if judge @entity70 believes that story , @entity1 could be acquitted of murder			1
she could find him guilty of the lesser charge of culpable homicide -- similar to what would be called manslaughter in the @entity76 -- or find him not guilty at all			0
the defense is likely to rely on three types of experts to support @entity1 ' story : ballistics @entity1 fired four shots			1
three hit @entity2 : one in the hip , one in the arm and one in the head			2
the shot to the head probably killed her almost instantly			2
but when did that shot hit her ? the prosecution says it hit her last			0
that means she would have been able to scream between shots -- potentially giving @entity1 a moment to realize his mistake and stop shooting			2
defense lawyer @entity21 rejected the prosecution 's order of shots , though , in a heated exchange with police capt. @entity98 , the prosecution ballistics expert			1
@entity21 said the defense ballistics expert would show that the order of shots was different , and that @entity1 fired the four shots in two quick bursts -- two " double taps			1
" @entity98 said it was " impossible " for the pattern of wounds on the body to be the result of two double taps , ultimately leaving @entity21 sighing dismissively and promising that his own ballistics expert would explain			0
pathology @entity1 threw up repeatedly as @entity112 , who performed the autopsy on @entity2 , described the devastating wounds @entity1 inflicted on her			1
but as gruesome as the testimony was , it is not critical to the state 's case -- there 's no doubt , after all , who killed @entity2 or how			1
the most damning thing @entity112 said was far less dramatic			0
based on the contents of her stomach , the pathologist suggested that @entity2 had probably eaten around 1 a.m. , about two hours before she died			0
that 's a direct contradiction of @entity1 ' story that they were in the bedroom by about 10 p.m. , her doing yoga and him watching television , and that they went to sleep after she finished her yoga			1
@entity21 hammered @entity112 on the question of when @entity2 last ate , going so far as to bring in academic articles for the pathologist to read , a clear sign that the defense considers it crucial to rebut that point			1
a pathologist who attended the autopsy on behalf of @entity1 , @entity143 , is due to testify for the defense			2
a police cell phone expert also may have found a similar inconsistency with @entity1 ' timeline			0
capt. @entity148 , who downloaded the contents of @entity150 , said it made an internet connection for about five minutes an hour and 20 minutes before the shooting			0
the defense may put forward an expert of their own to explain			0
psychiatry @entity1 needs the judge to believe not only that there is a chance he made a genuine mistake in thinking @entity2 was a burglar , but that his response was reasonable			1
@entity164 , a gun dealer who was selling a small arsenal to @entity1 at the time of the killing , testified that the athlete had passed a test showing he knew what the law said about firing in self - defense			2
on the face of it , what @entity1 did in firing through a closed door , when he could not see an imminent threat , was neither legal nor safe , the @entity174 testimony suggested			2
but a psychiatrist may argue that @entity1 should be judged by a different standard of reasonableness because he is a double amputee who was not wearing his prosthetics at the time			0
his statement at his bail hearing implied that he should : " as i did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable , i knew i had to protect @entity2 and myself			0
... i felt trapped as my bedroom door was locked and i have limited mobility on my stumps			0
" if the judge accepts that as true , @entity1 ' disability could prove to be his greatest defense .			1

the defense tries to convince a judge that @entity2 's death was n't murder
did @entity1 know his girlfriend was behind a door when he shot and killed her ?
and if he did not , did he act as a reasonable person would have ?
experts in ballistics , pathology and psychiatry will try to support @entity1 ' story
