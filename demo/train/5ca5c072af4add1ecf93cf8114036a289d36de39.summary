@entity0 -- a medical marijuana advocacy group sued the @entity4 administration thursday , saying its policy " to subvert local and state medical marijuana laws in @entity7 " is unconstitutional			2
@entity9 accused the @entity10 of deploying aggressive @entity12 - style raids , prosecuting medical marijuana patients and providers , and threatening local officials for implement state medical pot laws			1
the group , a nonprofit based in @entity19 , @entity7 , that says it 's the country 's largest medical marijuana advocacy organization , cited @entity23 attorney general @entity22 and @entity23 attorney @entity24 of the northern district of @entity7 in its federal lawsuit filed in @entity27			1
" under the @entity30 , the government may not commandeer the law - making function of the state or its subdivisions or indirectly through the selective enforcement of its drug laws , " the lawsuit said			0
" it is this misuse of the government 's commerce clause powers , designed to deprive the state of its sovereign ability to chart a separate course , that forms the basis of the plaintiff 's claim			0
" earlier this month , federal prosecutors in @entity7 announced a series of actions targeting what they characterized as the " large , for - profit marijuana industry " that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago			1
four @entity23 attorneys -- @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity24 -- detailed in a joint press release and later a press conference in @entity62 some steps that have been taken in conjunction with federal law enforcement and local officials in @entity7			1
they include letters of warning to landlords and lien holders of places in which marijuana is being sold illegally , " civil forfeiture lawsuits against properties involved in drug trafficking activity " and numerous criminal cases			0
the latter refers to arrests in recent weeks related to cases filed in federal courts in @entity0 , @entity84 , @entity62 and @entity85 , all part of an effort that @entity57 claimed has resulted in the seizure of hundreds of pounds of marijuana , tens of thousands of plants and hundreds of thousands in cash			0
thursday 's lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and was filed on behalf of its 20,000 members in @entity7 , the medical marijuana advocacy group said			2
" this case is aimed at restoring @entity7 's sovereign and constitutional right to establish its own public health laws based on this country 's federalist principles , " the association 's chief counsel , @entity94 , said in a statement			2
in 1996 , @entity7 voters approved @entity104 215 to exempt doctors and seriously ill patients from marijuana laws and allow them to grow and use it in treatment			0
the bill did n't legalize marijuana for all , but it did lead to the emergence of hundreds of dispensaries where people -- legally only those with medical conditions and a doctor 's authorization -- could get the drug			0
in explaining the federal crackdown earlier this month , @entity57 , the @entity23 attorney for the @entity120 , said authorities " are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people			1
we are targeting commercial operations , which profit from growing and distributing ... and often use the trappings of state law for cover , but in fact are abusing state law			0
" @entity24 , @entity23 attorney for @entity7 's northern district , claimed that " profiteers ... motivated not by compassion , but by money " had " hijacked " the intent of voters to help those suffering from debilitating conditions			1
and @entity58 , from @entity7 's central district , said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick , but to relatively healthy people			1
@entity1 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this story .			0
