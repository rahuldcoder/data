-- as the blondest brat in the @entity4 universe , actor @entity1 has no qualms about portraying the theoretically unlikable @entity6			1
so why do so many fans devote themselves to " @entity8 ? " @entity1 muses on the possibilities with @entity0			1
@entity0 : you have a fairly active dialogue with your fans			1
can you explain to the muggles why fans are so into " @entity8 ? " @entity1 : i definitely ca n't answer ; i have no idea			1
i 'm always curious when 7 - year - olds and 8 - year - olds come up to me and say , " yeah , @entity6 's my favorite character			2
" i always think , " hmmm , i 'm not sure if he should be			2
" i 'm not sure			2
i 've been told that people like a bad guy , or i guess people love to hate someone			2
i guess @entity6 has filled that role for quite a few years			2
but yeah , i 'm " @entity26 " all the way			2
@entity0 : was it ever difficult to play such a mean - spirited and dirisive character as @entity6 ? @entity1 : nothing but joy			1
i took great joy in every minute of it			2
it was like playing the polar opposite of me , really			0
it was kind of easy to step into his shoes and be delightfully horrible to everyone around me			0
i really enjoyed it and it never struck me as being difficult			0
which is a little strange , in itself			0
i guess there 's an evil kid inside me waiting to get out			0
@entity0 : is it ever possible for you to have a good hair day after a decade of bleaching your locks for the role ? @entity1 : not really			1
i 'm just grateful that i still have hair on my head after that many years of dying it			0
so yeah , it 's actually turned back to its normal condition and is in not bad shape			0
@entity0 : what kinds of perks do you get for being a part of the @entity4 franchise ? do you get a lifetime supply of butter beer ? @entity1 : i 've yet to cash in that coupon			1
what perks ? we get the dvd a week before it comes out			1
we 've been a couple of times to the @entity70 theme park , the @entity69 , and when we 're there we 're usually told to drink as much butter beer as we like			1
so yeah , you could call that a lifetime supply , i guess			0
@entity0 : @entity4 has established itself as a consequential fantasy franchise			1
has it influenced your tastes or is there a different genre that inspires you ? @entity1 : i 'm sure @entity4 will go down as this kind of fantasy thriller , but i see it as everything			1
it 's a romantic comedy , it 's dark humor , it 's kind of everything in every one of the films			1
i 'm not really a genre kind of guy			0
i do n't like to label films with a genre			1
i like all films whether it 's dark or light , love , hate , whatever it is , i enjoy it			1
@entity0 : was it ever heroes vs. villains on the set ? did you have a " @entity106 ? " @entity1 : you mean as the actors ? no , not really			1
bear in mind , we usually spend about 2 % of the day in character , the rest of it is just us			0
so most of it is just normal chat			0
i hate to sound boring ! @entity0 : do you have a favorite memory of your time spent on the @entity4 films ? @entity1 : i do n't really have one , that 's sort of like saying pick your favorite memory of the last 15 years			1
it 's the whole experience			0
the people that we work with , the relationships that we 've made , the costumes we got to wear and all the stupid stuff we got to do			0
it 's just the whole experience really			0
it 's very hard for me to pick one memory			0
@entity0 : what 's the most unexpected thing about being a part of @entity4 ? @entity1 : i guess that we 're still here			1
every year we kind of said , " when are the fans gon na get bored of these and move on ? " but they never did			1
every year the fans got more and more excited by everything			1
and it 's kind of crazy that we 're still here today talking about it			0
that 's definitely one of the things that surprised me the most about the whole thing			0
@entity0 : what is @entity147 like ? @entity1 : she 's exceptionally down to earth			1
she 's one of the most down to earth people i 've met			2
she 's very , very sweet -- i 'm always blown away by how down to earth she is			2
she 's a really , really nice person and it 's always a pleasure getting a chance to hang out with her			0
@entity0 : so many people around the world are fans of @entity158			2
what is @entity6 a fan of ? @entity1 : other than villainous ways ? he 's a fan of snakes			1
you know what , it 's weird because that 's kind of a changing question			0
because in the recent films i think it 's slightly different			2
probably freedom and , you know , not his parents			0
it 's a tough one			0
he 's a character with two sides .			0

@entity1 ca n't explain why so many @entity4 fans are on " @entity181 "
@entity147 impressed @entity1 as *incredibly* down to earth
as cast of the @entity4 films , @entity1 lists few perks , but they do *include* butter beer
