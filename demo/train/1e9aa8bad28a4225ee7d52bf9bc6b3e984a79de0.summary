@entity0 , @entity1 -- police used lasers to track the path of the bullets that @entity7 fired through a door , killing his girlfriend @entity9 , a ballistics expert testified tuesday			1
then they checked his height with and without his prosthetic legs , @entity3 capt. @entity10 said			1
he was on the verge of revealing his conclusions when time ran out and court adjourned for the day			2
he had time to say that the height of the four bullet holes in the door ranged from 93.5 cm to 104.3 cm above the floor			2
without his prosthetic legs on , the double amputee runner 's elbow height is 96 cm , @entity10 said as the 12th day of the @entity7 murder trial came to an end			1
the runner maintains that he was not wearing his prosthetics when he killed @entity9 , and after suggesting at his bail hearing last year that he was wearing them , the prosecution conceded last week that he was not			2
the one - time @entity1 national hero admits that he killed @entity9 on february 14 , 2013 , but pleaded not guilty to murder , saying the killing was a terrible mistake			1
he thought she was an intruder in his house in the middle of the night , and mistakenly believed he was defending himself , he maintains			0
that he was not wearing his prosthetics is a vital part of his defense			0
he argues he was justified in shooting through a toilet room door because he is particularly vulnerable when he is on the stumps of his legs			0
photos of victim 's wounds @entity7 listened to much of tuesday 's testimony impassively , but covered his face with his hands and stuffed his fingers in his ears when @entity10 talked about needing to see @entity9 's dead body as part of his investigation			1
" i have to see the position of all the injuries sustained , " the 20 - year police veteran said , before leafing through photos of bullet holes in the black sleeveless top she was wearing , her face , and injuries to her body			1
@entity7 spent hours throwing up in court last week as @entity9 's injuries were described by the witness who did her autopsy , and later when pictures of her injuries were briefly accidentally flashed on courtroom monitors			1
@entity9 's mother june was in court tuesday , and appeared to be crying when photos of the bathroom where her daughter died were displayed			1
a police crime scene photographer was on the witness stand for much of the day tuesday as defense lawyer @entity80 tried to show that police photos were not reliable evidence			1
he got the photographer , @entity83 , to say there was definitely no one else in the bathroom with him when he took pictures of the blood - spattered scene , then produced photographs which he said another police officer took in the same room at the same time			1
gory details lend trial a ' csi ' flavor " you did not see him in the bathroom ? " @entity80 demanded			0
" i did not see him , " @entity83 replied			0
" and how big is this bathroom ? " @entity80 asked incredulously , prompting laughter			0
" about six meters by five meters , " @entity83 replied calmly			0
prosecutor @entity99 fought back when questioning the photographer later , producing a photograph taken by the officer whom @entity80 said was in the same room at the same time			0
" are you in this photograph ? " @entity99 asked			0
" no , " @entity83 replied , eliciting a fresh burst of guffaws			0
blood evidence @entity80 also introduced a statement from another police officer , blood spatter expert @entity111 , to defend his client			1
@entity114 's affidavit said the blood he saw in the house was not only " consistent " with @entity7 ' version of events , but was the " most probable explanation			1
" he is on the list of possible prosecution witnesses but has not testified yet			0
@entity10 is the 16th state witness , out of a potential 107			0
the trial is currently scheduled to run through april 4 , take a break , and resume in mid-april			0
there 's no question that @entity7 shot @entity9 through a bathroom door in his house early on @entity128 last year , hitting her with three hollow - tipped bullets , one of which probably killed her almost instantly			1
@entity7 says he heard a noise in the middle of the night after getting out of bed , did not realize that she had also gotten out of bed , got his gun and shot her by accident			1
@entity7 first achieved fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who runs with special prostheses that earned him the nickname " @entity7			2
" the case against @entity7 is largely circumstantial , @entity99 said in his opening statement on march 3			2
@entity7 and @entity9 were the only people in his house when he killed her			2
@entity99 has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of police officers , experts , neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night , current and former friends of @entity7 ' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots			1
neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired			0
but the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was @entity9 screaming in fear for her life was in fact @entity7 when he realized what he had done			2
and the defense says that the sounds neighbors heard were not the gunshots , but a cricket bat hitting the door as he tried to rescue her			0
judge @entity170 will decide the verdict with the help of two lay people called assessors			1
@entity1 does not have jury trials			1
in @entity1 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years			2
@entity7 also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces			2
if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide , a crime based on negligence			0
the sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge 's discretion			0
@entity2 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
