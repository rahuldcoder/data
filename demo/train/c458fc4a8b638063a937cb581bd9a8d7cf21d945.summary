-- @entity1 can tell you what she ate on any date for the past five years			1
she can tell you how much she exercised , what kind of mood she was in , how much water she drank -- even if she watched television while mindlessly munching away			2
all she has to do is flip through the pages of her 14 journals			2
the reason she began her daily record keeping was simple -- she wanted to lose weight and keep it off			1
it may sound extreme , but it paid off			2
since she began keeping journals , @entity18 is half the person she used to be -- going from 260 to 130 pounds			1
" ( journaling has ) really helped me get an idea of what my behaviors are , what my patterns are , how i can make change for myself for good , " she said			1
" you would n't see it unless you look at it over time and you really get a chance to see this worked and why			2
" 7 weight loss myths ( sort of ) debunked ' it made me be honest with myself ' @entity18 , 53 , who lives in suburban @entity37 , said she did n't pay much attention to her gradual weight gain over the years			1
" i really did n't see it was sort of a mindless eating , " she said			2
stress from work factored in , she said , and she often had a quick bite whenever she had time			0
" i 'd make dinner and then after everything was done ... i would be by myself for a little bit and i 'd have the tv ( on ) and i would just want to wind down , " @entity18 said			0
that 's when she would start munching on chips or crackers			0
" i would n't even know how much i was eating			0
... i just could n't stop myself			0
" sorority girl drops 107 pounds her breaking point came when she was laid off from her marketing job in 2007 , she said			1
" that really made me say , ' ok , i got ta do something about my weight , now 's the chance , ' " she said			1
@entity18 did what many people do -- she joined a gym			0
however , she found exercise alone was not enough , and she soon turned to record keeping			0
despite holding bachelor 's and master 's degrees in nutrition , she had not been keeping track of her food and beverage intake			1
" i felt very ashamed to say , ' i have the background and the knowledge , but yet here i am at 260 pounds , ' " she said			1
" i was like the hairdresser who does n't have good hair			0
" journaling , however , turned out to be a game changer for @entity18			1
" that 's when the weight started to come off because i had already started exercising a little bit and that sort of triggered the whole exercise , eating , trying to sleep more ... trying not to stay up late and watch tv and really trying to track my moods , " she said			1
she was able to identify when she was mad or sad , and wanting to eat more			0
" it was my truth serum , " @entity18 said			0
" it made me be honest with myself			0
" other factors , not just calories " ( @entity91 ) is great proof of the benefits of self - monitoring in the weight loss and management process , " said dr. @entity87 , a bariatrician at @entity88 who sees both surgical and nonsurgical patients battling their weight			1
team loses 400 pounds for @entity98 " the easy answer to weight management is calories in , calories out , " @entity87 said			1
" but there 's actually a lot of other factors that affect how much you 're eating			0
" @entity87 said other factors include a person 's hydration , sleep duration , sleep patterns and emotions			0
she asks many patients to rate their hunger and thirst while they are eating			0
" ( journaling ) helps them recognize where they might be missing out and skipping meals , or going too long in between meals and therefore leading to overeating at subsequent meals , " she said			2
" for example , it 's a very common pattern that people tend to skip breakfast			0
they do n't eat until lunchtime , and then they may overeat at that meal or overeat at dinner			0
" @entity87 added , " once you start writing that down -- what you 're eating and the timing of the food -- you begin to pick up on some of these patterns that can be changed			2
" studies in the @entity138 and the @entity139 also support the benefits of journaling , although weight loss in both studies was modest			1
however , @entity87 said modest weight loss is " underappreciated			1
" " a lot of patients that i see come in with very high weight loss expectations and very few people say that their goal is only 5 % to 10 % of their body weight , " she said			1
" actually , that amount of weight loss has been shown very clearly to have considerable health benefits , including preventing future disease , reducing current diseases that are associated with obesity and helping patients decrease the number of medications they 're on			1
" she added , " that 's actually my first goal for all patients -- modest weight loss , or simply 5 % to 10 % -- and i think that every pound counts			1
" many times , @entity87 said , journaling is " the no. 1 goal we start working on " with patients			1
and the year 's best overall diet is ... ' road map ' to success an alternative to pen - and - paper journaling could be an application on your smartphone , said @entity176 , registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the @entity178			2
either way , @entity176 said she thinks of a journal as a " personal road map " to weight loss , healthier eating and behavior change			1
" regardless of whether you 're eating something healthy or not , you 're forced to think about it			0
when we look at mindful eating practices , it 's about being aware , " she said			0
" using a food journal helps you to become more aware of what you 're doing			2
" for @entity18 , mindful eating practices are a way of life			0
" it 's saying , ' i owe this to myself			0
' i need to be responsible for me and take care of me , and that 's something i never did , " she said			0
she has no plans to stop journaling but said she may soon begin record keeping online			2
" now it 's part of my daily habits , like brushing my teeth , " she said			0
