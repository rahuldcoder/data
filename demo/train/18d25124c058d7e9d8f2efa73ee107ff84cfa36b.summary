-- vacation season is nearly over , and kids are returning to school with the telltale tans and smiles that mean they had a wonderful and relaxing holiday			1
@entity7 and her husband were stuck in @entity9 after a volcanic eruption covered the town with ash			2
some of our ireporters were n't so lucky			1
we asked @entity0 readers to send us stories of their worst vacation nightmares , and rain at the beach seems ideal compared with the tales we received			1
here 's a sampling of the worst of the worst -- but do n't worry , most of our @entity13 can look back on their vacation horrors and laugh			1
@entity25 's vacation in @entity26 started off perfectly			1
his family loved the " sandy beaches , hot weather and a tropical paradise i had never seen , " he wrote in his @entity31			2
but @entity25 , who had been sick for much of the vacation , was diagnosed with cancer in a @entity35 hospital three days before his family was scheduled to fly home			1
" the doctors wanted to admit me right away and start treating me , " he said			2
but something did n't feel right about the situation			2
so @entity25 's parents ( he was 17 at the time ) declined treatment and decided to wait out the rest of the vacation and ask his regular physician about it when the family arrived home in @entity49			1
" by the time we went home , i 'd already started feeling better , " @entity25 said			2
the cancer diagnosis ? a terrifying mistake			1
@entity25 had thought his illness was mononucleosis the entire time , and his doctor at home confirmed the diagnosis			2
ireport.com : mistaken cancer diagnosis in @entity26 " my doctor was looking at the report all confused , and he said of course your white blood cell count was up -- that 's what happens when you get sick ! " @entity25 said			1
@entity25 's parents did n't tell him about the cancer diagnosis until the family had returned home and his own doctor had refuted it			1
" it was a crappy vacation for me just because i was sick , " he said			1
" but for my parents , to know that your child has been diagnosed by doctors , and you 're supposed to trust what these people have to say , i 'm pretty sure they did n't enjoy the vacation			1
they were so relieved and happy that they stuck to their guns			2
" @entity85 and her family never even made it to the tropics			1
they took a cruise bound for the @entity91 and ended up spending their vacation on a ship with a broken propulsion system			1
" it was @entity98 week , and my birthday fell on @entity98 , too , " she said			0
" i thought i 'd be on the beach in the @entity91 with a margarita in my hand for my birthday			0
" instead , @entity104 ' cruise ship was stranded in @entity105 , @entity106 , for the entire week			1
passengers could go to a mall in @entity105 and to bars and restaurants on the ship , she said , but not much else			1
and when passengers began to get angry and restless , @entity104 said the captain gave a mutiny warning and local law enforcement boarded the ship			0
" you knew you were still in the @entity119 , but you felt like you were in another dimension , " she said			0
" he said we were under maritime law , and any aggression toward the staff would be mutiny and would be dealt with accordingly			0
" ireport.com : the cruise to nowhere @entity104 and her family were eventually able to leave the ship , and they spent the rest of their vacation with relatives in @entity106			1
the cruise line offered passengers a refund and a discount on another cruise , but @entity104 says she would have to think seriously before getting on a cruise ship again			2
" when cruises go bad , they go bad exponentially , " she said			0
the cruise line in question declined to comment			2
@entity98 and birthdays are n't the only special occasions that can be spoiled by less - than - perfect vacations			0
@entity150 and her husband found themselves in the middle of a hurricane on their honeymoon			0
the couple was supposed to fly to @entity158 , stopping briefly in @entity159 to change planes			0
" upon arriving in @entity159 , we discovered why our plane was not full and why our flight [ to @entity158 ] had been cancelled , " @entity150 wrote in her @entity31			0
" @entity163 , category four , was heading directly for @entity159 and would be there by nightfall			0
" despite trying immediately to leave -- " get us on the next flight anywhere , " @entity150 remembers telling the airline staff -- the newlyweds were stuck			0
@entity150 , a @entity169 , @entity106 , native , says even though she was used to hurricanes , this one was the worst			1
ireport.com : hurricane on a honeymoon " when you 're not home , everything 's different , and it was much scarier , " she said			2
" the hotel asked everyone to go to the ballroom			0
... we could hear the steel shutters banging and hear the storm , and when we heard glass breaking , they got everybody into the older section of the building that was all concrete blocks			0
" after the storm passed , @entity191 and her husband made it to @entity158 , where they stayed a few extra days			0
but the " coup de grace , " as she put it , was on their flight home			0
" we met a couple who flew out the same day we did and we asked if they got hit by the hurricane , and they said no. they were supposed to go through @entity159 , too , but their airline put them through @entity210 instead because of the storm , " she said			0
" it 's very frustrating			0
" and frustrating does n't even begin to describe the feelings of many other ireporters who wrote in to tell us about their worst vacations ever			1
@entity217 and his family suffered through airplane delays that made their trip to @entity222 , @entity223 , take two days			0
once they arrived , they survived flooding and respiratory infections			2
ireport.com : the worst @entity229 ever @entity7 and her husband had to wear face masks during their entire trip to @entity9			1
@entity233 from a recent volcanic eruption , which " looked very much like snow , " destroyed the air quality and caused many businesses and the airport to close , delaying their return by three days			0
ireport.com : volcanic eruption in @entity9 @entity85 , the cruise ship passenger stuck in @entity105 , summed up the thoughts of most of our @entity13 : " we had just bought a house and were doing construction and wanted to get away			1
we thought , stress - free -- all you have to think about is what bar and what time			0
and right off the top , something went wrong			0
