-- @entity1 sent investors reeling thursday after asking creditors to freeze the debt repayments of one of its biggest holding companies , @entity6			1
the announcement came after the market close on the eve of the @entity12 holiday and @entity13 in the @entity14 , leaving traders ' hands tied over their exposure to investments in the @entity19			2
shares dropped in @entity21 and @entity22 as bankers struggled to gauge the implications of the debt freeze without additional guidance from @entity27			0
with very little information being distributed from @entity1 , the market has been left to question the motives of ruler @entity31 and the financial future of @entity6 and its huge portfolio			1
so what happened ? late wednesday , the government of @entity1 issued a statement saying it had authorised the @entity37 to " spearhead the restructure of @entity6 with immediate effect			1
" the first step , it said , was to ask all providers of financing to @entity6 and @entity44 to " standstill " its debt repayments until at least may 30 , 2010			1
it added , to the market 's surprise , that the proceeds of a $ 5 billion bond issue raised hours earlier would n't be used to bail the company out			1
odd timing was n't it ? @entity1 's decision to release its statement just before the @entity12 holiday in the @entity57 , and on the eve of @entity13 in the @entity14 , provoked consternation			1
" @entity1 have certainly picked their moment to finally own up to a need to restructure their debt			2
i would imagine the news has ruined a few @entity13 dinners today , " @entity65 , a strategist at @entity66 told the @entity67			0
read @entity0 's @entity70 ' take on the @entity1 debt fears how did the markets react ? banking stocks led equity markets lower in @entity21 and @entity22 as traders moved to distance themselves from a potential debt hole in the @entity57			1
technical problems in @entity21 halted trade for some time , providing further frustration for traders with exposure to @entity6 's lenders			1
what is @entity6 & @entity44 ? described on its web site as " @entity1 's flag bearer in global investments , " @entity6 is a holding company with stakes in everything from ports to real estate and transport			1
it includes the world 's largest privately held real estate company @entity44 , which is the mastermind behind such architectural feats as the man - made residential islands , " the @entity98 " and " @entity99			1
" @entity6 also invests in global markets through its investment arm @entity102 , which boasts a " global footprint " in finance , capital , leisure , aviation and other business ventures			1
how severe is the debt ? @entity6 is said to account for some $ 59 billion of @entity1 's $ 80 billion debt burden			1
@entity44 had been due to pay a $ 3.5 billion convertible loan which expires on december 14			1
more debts were due to be repaid next year			0
" this is not just a couple of billion story , " @entity113 , @entity114 economist at the @entity115 told @entity0			0
" for instance , @entity1 has to service $ 10 billion including the @entity44 debt in december and $ 15 billion @entity14 dollars by the end of 2010 , " he added			1
how much damage has the announcement done ? that 's incalculable at this stage			0
markets in the @entity57 and the @entity14 do n't open until next week so the full impact wo n't be known until then			2
it also depends on @entity1 's next move			2
the surprise announcement has shaken confidence in the @entity19 as a place to do business			0
" the key here is the communication of this strategy			0
i guess everybody is on the same page regarding the need for consolidation in @entity1 and for the region			2
but the only market - positive implication would be if this comes with a clearly open and a predictable way , " @entity113 said			0
" the problem is , here we have a lack of transparency and all these policy reactions are either coming at the last minute , or for example , the recent one just before the long holiday			0
" " i think this is going to shake some investor confidence which may not be reversed as quickly as people expect			0
so they have to be careful , " he added			0
who will bail them out ? @entity160 has been a lucrative source of funding for its neighbor			0
the $ 5 billion bond issue was take up by @entity166 banks			2
the question now is whether it will continue to give its backing to its debt - laden neighbour			0
it may have the money to do so , but does it have the will ? what comes next ? ideally , the market wants guidance as to @entity1 's debt strategy			1
it has said that the @entity6 debt freeze is the first stage of a restructuring plan			2
investors want to know what comes next			0
right now , the region is seen as a risky bet for nervous investors			0
@entity113 says there are other options for those who want to back similar markets			0
" from an investor perspective , if you want to still play for the global backdrop of oil prices , etc. there are some other markets , say @entity196 or @entity197 , that investors can be interested in , rather than taking this high risk for the region , " he said .			2

@entity1 stuns global investors by calling for a debt " standstill " on @entity6 and @entity44 debts
market reactions restrained by public holidays in the @entity57 and the @entity14
@entity44 is @entity6 's real estate arm , owns " the @entity98 , " and " @entity99 "
@entity6 said to account for $ 59 billion of @entity213 's $ 80 billion debt
