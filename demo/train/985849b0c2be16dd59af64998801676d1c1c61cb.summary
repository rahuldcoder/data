-- eighty years after @entity2 sprung up around the country , and four months after tens of thousands descended on the @entity6 state capitol , progressives have a new home in what they 're calling @entity9			1
the @entity11 tent city is named in honor -- or , more accurately , in defiance -- of gov. @entity14 , who became an icon for conservatives and lightning rod for liberals after he pushed through a controversial new collective bargaining law earlier this year			1
@entity20 , one of @entity9 's coordinators , said the aim is to recapture the spirit of @entity2 , the shanty towns that popped up and were named to tweak president @entity26 's perceived inaction in the @entity27 's early years			1
since saturday night 's kick - off , about 80 tents have sprung up in and around @entity30 in @entity11 , with a handful of people sticking it out throughout but mostly fresh rounds of activists rotating through on a daily basis			1
" just like the original @entity2 in the 1930s , we wanted to create that type of atmosphere without being destructive , " said @entity20 , a government affairs coordinator for the @entity38 union			0
some major differences , of course , are that @entity9 will only be up for two weeks , its participants generally can go home , and it is more of a staged political event			1
@entity20 noted that , unlike the february protests , this edition is carefully planned with permits , rules , a schedule of speakers and a conscious effort to make a point without disrupting local businesses			0
there 's a new theme each day : on sunday , for instance , protests focused on planned $ 800 million cuts to k - 12 education			2
and one of the most anticipated moments will be monday , when hundreds of firefighters -- who were exempted from @entity14 's original collective bargaining law , but could see cuts in its more recent incarnation -- are expected to march in @entity11			1
judge strikes down collective bargaining restrictions it is highly unlikely that organizers , at any point , will match the tens of thousands who , at times , occupied the capitol building in protest this winter			0
times have changed , as have public sentiments and strategies			0
much of their efforts recently centered around recall petitions aimed at ousting several @entity89 senators and turning the chamber over to @entity91			2
" there was this immediacy and a real intensity at the beginning , " recalled @entity92 , the head of @entity11 's teachers ' union			1
" that intensity is still in people 's hearts , but now we 've entered the next phase for the long term			2
... and @entity9 is just another way for us to get the message out			2
" one major goal , and challenge , with events like @entity9 is to keep up pressure on @entity14 and other @entity89 leaders without alienating independents who will eventually decide whether to affirm or reject their decisions , @entity20 said			1
" the idea is to balance between a group 's right to protest vs. acting in such a manner that people this is too irritating , we do n't agree with it , " he said			2
" ( the general public ) does n't want to talk about people being arrested			0
and ( demonstrators ) know what the rules are this time			0
" progressive leaders in @entity6 insist their message is getting through , including among independents who might have voted for @entity14 but have since soured on his and @entity89 tactics in addressing the budget situation			1
" there 's an incredible amount of frustration , " said @entity131 , a progressive blogger in northwest @entity6			1
" there is a basic feeling that all these laws are going to be rammed through the legislature , and there 's nothing you can do about it			2
" yet for all this talk on the left , there 's been no change in who controls @entity11 -- republicans -- nor any indication that they intend to back down			1
whether it has to do with collective bargaining , voting requirements or a host of other matters , the @entity89 still has the upper hand as it 's proven in pushing through a host of measures in the months after the february confrontation			2
and @entity14 , especially , continues to be a darling of the nationwide conservative movement , as does like - minded @entity6 @entity89 @entity158 rep. @entity89			1
in april , @entity159 urged others nationwide to follow @entity11 's example in targeting the benefits and pay of unions , despite intense pressure			1
" this is where real courage and real solidarity can be found , " the 2008 @entity89 vice presidential nominee said			0
" you saw these violent rent - a - mobs trash your capital and vandalize businesses			0
your governor did the same thing			0
" the law that sharply curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees remains the biggest , most critical piece in the fight			0
@entity89 insist that the measure is necessary to control skyrocketing public employee benefit costs and close a $ 137 million budget shortfall			0
@entity91 argue that it is little more than an attempt to gut public - sector labor unions , one of their core constituencies			0
on monday , @entity6 's @entity191 is set to weigh whether or not they will take up the battle over the law , weeks after @entity6 judge @entity190 struck it down			1
state democratic leaders claim that @entity89 legislators violated the state 's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend @entity14 's budget bill without providing the necessary public 24 - hour advance notice			1
@entity91 say they were given only two hours ' notice			0
while the court will have their say , @entity20 says the long - term vision is to use events like @entity9 to reach those in the middle and convince them that they 're better off voting out republicans like the governor			1
" this is n't about changing the minds of the @entity89 legislature , " said @entity20 , claiming they 've turned a " deaf ear " to such protests			0
" the ear we want to reach is the @entity6 voter			2
" still for all the speeches , events and acrimony on all sides of the debate -- and for all the twists and turns that have marked the past six months -- even diehard political junkies like @entity131 say it is nearly impossible to predict how this political saga will unfold			0
" i wake up every morning and there are surprises , " @entity131 said			0
" so i 'm not sure at all , where we 'll be six months from now , or one year or two years			0

a tent city has sprung up in @entity11 in what progressives are calling @entity9
it 's part of a 2 - week rally aimed at critiquing the *policies* of @entity6 republicans
gov. @entity14 is a darling of the conservative movement for cost - cutting plans
