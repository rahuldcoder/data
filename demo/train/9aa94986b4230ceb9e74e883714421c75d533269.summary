@entity0 -- there were always three pictures of @entity4 on the mantelpiece of the various houses @entity7 lived in when he was growing up -- including one signed and dated by the king on the day of his coronation -- but as a boy in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity7 does n't remember wondering why			1
only years later , after his father died and @entity7 inherited a box of papers and scrapbooks , did it all begin to make sense			1
@entity7 's grandfather was @entity18 , the @entity20 speech therapist played by @entity21 in the @entity23 nominated movie " @entity24			1
" @entity7 -- born 12 years after his grandfather died -- had inherited some archive : @entity28 cards from the king and queen , a condolence card from @entity4 to @entity18 when his wife died , and a letter of thanks from the queen for a letter @entity7 wrote when the king himself died several years later			1
the papers also include hundreds of letters exchanged by the king and the speech therapist , whom he met more than a decade before he was crowned			1
" the content of the letters between them is incredibly friendly as you 'd expect between two friends , " @entity7 says			1
" but there is a kind of etiquette that @entity18 still abides by , " addressing @entity4 as " your @entity51			1
" @entity4 addressed his friend as " @entity54 , " and signed the early letters " @entity56 " -- his name before he was crowned king			2
the later letters are signed " @entity4			2
" also among his grandfather 's papers is what @entity7 believes is the actual copy of the speech @entity4 read at the outbreak of war with @entity67 1939 -- the climactic scene of the movie			1
" in this grave hour , perhaps the most fateful in our history ... " the speech begins			0
the copy in @entity7 's archive contains handwritten pencil notes , indicating what words to stress and where to pause			1
" @entity24 " condenses the friendship of the monarch and commoner into about a year , but the real @entity4 and @entity7 knew each other for a quarter of a century			1
" the first thing that i came across that startled me was his appointment card , " @entity7 says			2
in tiny handwriting , @entity7 assessed his new patient , @entity56 , @entity87 in 1926			2
the duke " has acute nervous tension which has been brought on by the defect			0
he is of nervous disposition ... contracts teeth and mouth and mechanically closes throat ... an extraordinary habit of clipping small words - an , in , on - and saying the first syllable of one word and the last syllable of another , " @entity7 wrote			2
the @entity87 saw @entity7 almost every day for next two or three months , in advance of a royal visit to @entity20 , @entity7 's records show			1
the friendship lasted for the rest of their lives , although it seems they were never photographed together			0
at the @entity109 in 1937 , @entity7 is seated in the royal box , with his wife , @entity111			2
they are so high up , she 's using opera glasses			0
@entity111 died suddenly of a heart attack after @entity116 , prompting the king to write : " @entity54 , i must send you one line to tell you how terribly sorry i was to hear of your bereavement			0
and i send you all my deepest sympathy in your great grief ... i do so feel for you as i know you had a perfect companionship with her			0
" @entity7 gets choked up reading the letter generations later			2
" it 's something about thinking about him hurting after @entity111 's death ... makes it kind of real , " he says			2
the archive inspired him to write a book with the author @entity132			0
" @entity24 " director @entity133 starting looking at @entity7 's material about seven weeks before starting filming , @entity7 says -- and was able to add some details to the movie as a result			1
@entity133 had n't known , for example , that the king took off his jacket and stood to deliver the 1939 speech , since photos of the event show him seated and in full military uniform			0
and , from @entity7 's diary , a joke was added			1
" i went to @entity148 on sunday for the broadcast ... only one mistake ... w in weapons , " @entity7 wrote			0
" after the broadcast i shook hands with the @entity4 and congratulated him			0
and asked him why he stopped on the w. he replied with a grin			0
i did it on purpose			0
i exclaimed -- on purpose ? and he said yes -- if i do n't make a mistake they wo n't know it 's me			0
" the movie did make some changes , of course : the real @entity18 was more deferential than @entity21 's character , and rather shorter than his movie counterpart			1
and another thing the movie does not tell audiences is that the king and the therapist remained close until the end of their lives			0
the following year , his friend @entity18 died too .			0

the grandson of the @entity21 character in the movie has the real @entity18 's papers
they include letters between @entity4 and his grandfather
the two men were really friends for a quarter of a century
