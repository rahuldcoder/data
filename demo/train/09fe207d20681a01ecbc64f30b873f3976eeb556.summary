editor 's note : @entity2 is a member of the @entity4 editorial board , a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to @entity7			2
@entity2 says president @entity10 's war on drugs remains a noble battle for the soul of @entity14			1
@entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity7 ) -- it has nothing to do with @entity19 or @entity20 , but there 's a big story brewing south of the border to which @entity23 should pay close attention			0
like a monster that refuses to die , @entity14 's once - disgraced @entity25 , or @entity25 , made a convincing comeback in last weekend 's midterm elections			1
the @entity25 recaptured its majority in the 500 - member @entity30 and won five of six governorships up for grabs			2
the rival @entity34 , or @entity34 , which had controlled the legislative branch since 2000 , suffered heavy losses			0
@entity39 @entity38 , president of the @entity34 , resigned this week after taking responsibility for the electoral failures			0
political observers on both sides of the border are calling the elections results a no - confidence vote in the @entity14 economy and a significant rebuke to president @entity10 's admirable but all - consuming war against the drug cartels			1
@entity10 -- who is in the @entity34 -- is halfway through a six - year term , so he was n't on the ballot			2
the presidency is next on the ballot in 2012 , and observers think that the fact that the @entity25 aced its midterms sets the party up nicely to accomplish something that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago : retake the top job that it held for much of the 20th century -- 71 years , to be precise -- through corruption and intimidation			2
in 2000 , the @entity34 's @entity63 broke that streak and reintroduced democracy in @entity14			2
@entity10 squeaked out a narrow victory against a third - party candidate in 2006			0
the @entity69 - educated lawyer and economist immediately and bravely took the fight to drug lords across the country , unleashing the military in a conflict that has so far killed more than 10,000 @entity14 with no end in sight			2
and there are now serious issues -- as spelled out this week in the @entity80 -- involving allegations of torture , forced disappearances and other abuse by the @entity14 military as it seeks to retaliate for the killing of soldiers and other terrorist acts committed by the drug cartels			2
the @entity91 administration , which has pledged to support @entity10 's drug war , would no doubt like to put an end to this alleged behavior before paying out the remainder of the $ 1.4 billion in aid to @entity14 that @entity97 approved in the @entity98			1
the trouble is that president @entity91 has been reluctant to make human rights demands of an adversary such as @entity102 , which could make it hard to lean on a friend such as @entity14			0
and as @entity14 human rights activists point out , the @entity23 government is in a difficult position to preach against torture given that it is accused of using it in @entity112 , @entity113 and at @entity114 , @entity115			0
still , @entity10 's war remains a noble battle for the soul of @entity14			1
and there 's evidence that the drug cartels are feeling the pinch			1
unable to move their product to customers in @entity126 and the @entity23 , the cartels are growing desperate			0
the @entity10 government is seizing so much of the product and arresting or killing so many drug traffickers , that profits are slipping			1
the drug lords are forced to import more guns from the @entity23 at higher prices and channel more drug shipments to @entity14 customers , who pay lower prices than the cartels could charge @entity23 if the drugs were making their way north			1
this is bad news for the traffickers			0
but it 's great news for the @entity14 people , even if they do n't know it			0
judging from reports in the @entity14 press , many @entity14 -- while supportive of the drug war -- think it ultimately will fail , and they 're tired of the violence			1
many fault @entity10 for , in a popular metaphor , " stirring the hornet 's nest			1
" meanwhile , although the @entity25 did n't explicitly campaign on a platform of being anti-drug war , the implied message was that returning the party to power could return tranquillity and security to @entity14			1
good luck with that , amigos			0
guess what ? the hornets are n't going back in the nest			0
@entity10 should get to the bottom of allegations of military abuse and punish any offenders			0
but he should also press ahead			1
and , if the @entity25 tries to get in the way by , say , limiting the resources to fight the drug war , then @entity10 should paint the party as trying to appease the cartels at the expense of @entity14			1
the @entity25 was so preoccupied with gaining power as it did in the past that it forgot that what leadership is really about is taking responsibility for the future			0
here 's its chance .			0

@entity14 leader @entity10 may face defeat in 2012 after @entity25 makes comeback
some @entity14 fault @entity10 for stirring up violence with war on drugs
@entity10 should address problems and press ahead , @entity2 says
evidence points to drug traffickers feeling the pinch , @entity2 says
