@entity0 will be the first city in @entity2 to host the @entity3 in its history -- a shift of axis that makes sense in the new world politics			1
i hope this change is not only geographical and that we can make a memorable event			0
in terms of organization , despite potential problems in the structure of airports and public transportation systems , everything should come out satisfactorily			0
@entity0 has hosted other major world events , and after hosting the @entity21 in 2014 it will be prepared			0
the question that arises is : how do we want to show @entity24 to the world ? internally , this debate promises to be very lively			1
@entity24 measures progress by the growth of gdp -- an index that is questionable to evaluate the progress of a country -- but as this is the current view , i think many here would like to take advantage of the visibility of the @entity3 to show the world how our agriculture has become one of the most productive and advanced in the world , to show our energetic potential or the strength of our internal market that makes us more immune to global economic crisis			1
eyes turn to @entity0 's preparations there are groups in @entity24 that sees the @entity3 in @entity0 as an opportunity to do more business			2
i 'm sure there are government sectors who also wish to use the opening ceremony of the @entity3 to reinforce these points ... but our internal achievements do not interest the rest of the world			2
what sets us apart , and should be the center of attention , not only in the opening ceremony but during all the @entity3 , is our natural resources and the importance they have for the world			1
@entity67 still covers 68 % of @entity24 's vast territory			2
the @entity69 represents over half of the world 's remaining rainforest			2
we know that these rainforests play a crucial role for global biodiversity conservation and a valuable freshwater resource , but also provide essential ecological services such as a carbon sink			0
that is why we call it the lungs of the world and we know how it is increasingly critical to the fragile balance of the planet 's climate			1
@entity0 mayor : how to build the city of the future at a time when the world sees the verge of a collapse in it 's natural resources , food security and survival of hundreds of millions of people who are threatened by lack of water and oceanic resources depleting , the @entity90 are the perfect platform to expose that we urgently need to change our consumption patterns and our way of life if we want a future for our grandchildren			1
the true @entity3 spirit is to bring together all countries and all people for a common goal			0
in other games , host cities have reinforced the importance of peace , of economic development , and praised technology or human values			0
i think right now what matters most to the entire planet is the question of the survival of our species			0
@entity0 with its forests and impressive nature seems to be the ideal stage to do it			0
it could be the @entity3 of the future -- a real planetary event .			1
