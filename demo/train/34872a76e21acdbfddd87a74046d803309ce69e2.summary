@entity5 , @entity3 the start of our 15 - hour trip is stunning			1
idyllic white sand beaches stretch along the coast of @entity3 , @entity8			1
an occasional fishing boat is the only interruption to this part of the largely untouched coastline			2
a peaceful tranquility that makes the horrors some 100 nautical miles from here seem implausible			0
as we head out into open waters with an @entity8 @entity20 boat , the winds pick up and the waves increase			0
the weather forecast sunday was better than previous days -- the crew confirms it is an improvement -- but conditions are still rough			1
looking out at the vast expanse of the @entity5 , the crew tries to spot bodies or debris from @entity29			1
as i think i might have seen something , it disappears beneath a wave and does not always resurface			0
pieces of wood , rubbish or seaweed confuse the naked eye			0
the challenge of spotting debris or a beloved member of a distraught family in these waters is immense			1
one crew member thinks he spots something , then loses sight of it			0
but he is convinced enough of its import for the captain to call it in so a larger ship nearby can investigate			1
@entity52 for black box this ship has a very specific mission			1
on board is a pinger locator that needs to be delivered to a vessel stationed in @entity59 of the search zone			1
a crucial piece of equipment to hunt for the flight data recorder , or so - called black box , without which the mystery of the crash of this airliner may never be solved			1
but the captain is nervous			0
captain @entity70 tells me his boat is not large enough to be in waters this choppy			0
" i feel a heavy moral burden , " he says			0
" i have a responsibility to keep those on board safe , but it is so important to help find bodies and debris			1
" @entity70 says he 's proud to be a part of this operation , but would not normally bring his boat out for so long in such conditions			1
yet the mood is upbeat among the crew			0
in recent days the weather has forced them to stay along the coastline , scouring for bodies or debris that may have drifted from the crash site			2
they now seem happy to be able to deliver much - needed supplies to colleagues out at sea			2
by late afternoon , the target ship comes into view			2
the @entity97 has been here for days and relies heavily on these deliveries			0
transferring equipment from one boat to the other may sound like the most straightforward part of the long day			2
the swell of the sea pushes the ships together with a dull thud as boat - side buoys collide			2
a crudely taped cardboard box holding the precious acoustic cargo is hastily handed over before the waves push the boats apart again			0
it is deemed too dangerous for the expert accompanying the equipment to make the jump between ships			2
an hour - long attempt to transfer the inflatable boat needed to help operate the locator ends in frustration amid rough seas and fading light			1
as night falls with only half a mission accomplished , the deflated crew turns for port determined to try again tomorrow			0
they 'll have a few hours sleep ahead of another long day			0

@entity131 heads out to the search zone off @entity3 in rough seas looking for any debris or remains of @entity29
this particular ship is also delivering equipment to help to locate the crashed airliner 's flight data recorder
rough sea conditions in the @entity5 have *hampered* the search , frustrating search crews
