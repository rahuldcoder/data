@entity0 has grappled with many perilous issues in its more than six decades of existence			2
but it 's had few times quite like this			0
that was obvious thursday , as leaders of the trans - @entity9 alliance 's member countries met in @entity10			2
they discussed everything from @entity12 to the @entity13 to @entity14 , each of which has its own special significance and presents its own unique military and diplomatic challenges			1
" we meet at a crucial time in the history of our alliance , " @entity21 prime minister @entity20 said at the outset of the two - day summit			1
" the world faces many dangerous and evolving threats , and it is absolutely clear that @entity0 is as vital to our future as it has been in our past			1
" there was no indication given that @entity0 , as a group , will be deploying more ground troops anytime soon to any new conflict -- as it has done before most recently following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			2
still , the alliance is looking at a range of options to combat a range of diverse threats			2
here 's a look at a few developments on those front , broken down by region : @entity47 and @entity48 @entity0 has only invoked @entity49 -- which mandates all countries come to the aid of another member of the alliance -- one time , in response to the @entity56 threat following 9/11			1
now , its member states are intensely focused on @entity58 , a relatively new terrorist group that has rampaged through the @entity13 , executing @entity60 journalists and threatening more @entity62 ' lives			2
no one is saying that @entity0 is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago , including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did @entity12			1
but its leaders are certainly talking tough about @entity58 and the prospect of @entity0 playing a role in attacking it			1
any request by @entity47 to @entity0 for aid in fighting @entity58 would be " considered seriously , " according to @entity0 secretary general @entity73 , who noted the @entity47 government has n't reached out yet to the alliance			1
the @entity60 , however , has coordinated with the @entity77 government to launch airstrikes on @entity58 fighters in @entity47 and opened the door for similar attacks in @entity48			2
@entity20 told @entity82 that his country supports these @entity60 strikes and could take part in further military action			2
" we do n't rule anything out , " said @entity20 , adding that he wants @entity58 " squeezed out of existence			1
" " we will act with partners in our national interest , " @entity20 said			0
yet he , like @entity60 officials , stressed that military might alone wo n't end the threat posed by the @entity96 militant group			0
@entity20 said it 's imperative local and national authorities in the @entity13 take control and offer their citizens a government they can rely on			0
" we must recognize , " @entity20 said , " that what 's required is helping those on the ground , rather than some @entity62 intervention ( that is ) completely over their heads and ( leaves ) them to pick up the pieces			0
" @entity14 @entity0 countries ' work with the governments of @entity47 and @entity48 have been mixed , at best			1
for @entity47 , they criticized prime minister @entity116 until he was forced out of office , then worked closely with his successor to go after @entity58			0
for @entity48 , they 've refused to cooperate at all with @entity48 president @entity120 -- even if he and @entity0 share a common enemy in @entity58			1
@entity14 , though , is a different story			0
@entity62 leaders have made a point of supporting the @entity126 - based government as it combats a rebel movement that , its officials say , has been supported in most every which way by the @entity130			0
and even as @entity132 denies any direct involvement , @entity62 officials have demanded the @entity134 withdraw thousands of troops they say have crossed the border and shelled @entity14 forces , not to mention pull its troops back from the border			2
" this is the first time since the end of @entity142 that one @entity144 country has tried to grab another 's territory by force , " said @entity73 on thursday			0
" @entity144 must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of strongest			0
" but what can @entity0 countries do about it ? @entity60 president @entity151 , for one , promised this week that " we will defend our @entity0 allies			1
" but @entity14 is n't part of that alliance , and @entity151 has n't suggested he 'll send @entity60 troops to faceoff with @entity134 forces in the country			1
@entity14 , however , is working more and more closely with @entity0 , as evidenced by the @entity10 summit			1
@entity73 said @entity0 will give nearly $ 20 million for @entity14 's military and focus on bolstering its cyber-defense , logistics and command and control capabilities			1
" it is definitely a landmark event , " president @entity166 said of the " strong , enormous support " that @entity0 government leaders have afforded @entity14 at the @entity10 summit			1
" ( @entity171 is ) at the highest level during the 20 - year history of the partnership between @entity14 and @entity0			1
" opinion : @entity0 's moment of truth on @entity14 @entity12 @entity12 is where @entity0 has had its biggest , and most long - lasting , footprint outside of @entity144			1
but that is changing -- or at least @entity0 's mission in the south @entity182 nation is changing			0
exactly how is up in the air , in part to a crisis related to @entity12 's recent presidential election			0
despite efforts by the @entity189 to disrupt the election , about 8 million votes were cast on june 14 , with provisional results showing @entity192 ahead with roughly 56 % support to 43 % for @entity194 , according to the country 's @entity195			0
yet both candidates have alleged large - scale voter fraud and manipulation , and @entity194 has n't conceded			0
that 's left the nation in limbo -- to this point , the inauguration of the new president was pushed back indefinitely from the first week of august , as an audit of the vote is conducted -- and @entity0 's @entity208 in limbo as well			2
that 's because current @entity12 president @entity211 had refused to sign what 's known as a @entity213 that would set the terms of keeping international forces in @entity12 beyond the end of this year			1
both @entity192 and @entity217 have said they 'd sign it , but -- since neither is in office -- they ca n't			0
there is also the threat that the election crisis could lead to internal fighting in @entity12 , further destabilizing an already turbulent nation dealing with a @entity189 insurgency			0
@entity73 said thursday that his alliance hopes to continue its efforts in @entity12 through " a new , non-combat mission to train , advise and assist the @entity12 forces starting next year			2
" but " without a signature " on the @entity213 , " there can be no mission , " he added			0
" although our military commanders have shown great flexibility in their planning , time is short , " @entity73 added			0
" the sooner the legal framework is in place , the better			0

@entity0 chief : " @entity245 is short " for a deal on international forces in @entity12
@entity14 president : @entity0 countries have offered " strong , enormous support "
@entity21 leader says " we do n't rule anything out " when it comes to going after @entity58
@entity20 : now " a crucial time ( for ) alliance " *due* to " many dangerous and evolving threats "
