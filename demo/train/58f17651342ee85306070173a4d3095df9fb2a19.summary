in a press conference on tuesday , the @entity12 senator was quick to downplay his decision as a political move , telling the public that he will not " become a @entity17 " or side with all the their policy positions going forward			2
" who i caucus with is less important than who i work with -- every day in the committee , on the senate floor , in the hallways , and here at home , " he said			2
" that 's what 's best for @entity12 -- and that 's what 's best for the country ; that 's what i 've done so far			2
" @entity2 , who considered siding with the @entity35 , would have added an extra seat to the majority if he caucused with them			1
" a fair question at the outset is whether being in the majority caucus is n't reason enough in itself to make the switch , " he said			0
" but i think there are other considerations -- particularly as they relate to @entity12 -- that offset this argument			0
" @entity2 said he now has the responsibility to " pull his colleagues toward the center , " the same type of role he said fellow @entity54 and @entity55 sen. @entity55 had under a @entity3 majority			1
@entity6 echoed @entity2 's sentiments in an interview wednesday , saying he would n't leave the @entity3 party to caucus with the @entity35 despite his own party losing the @entity62 majority tuesday night			1

" this is a real ass - whuppin , " @entity6 said			0
the first - term senator is rumored to be considering leaving @entity73 and mounting a bid for governor in his home state			0
" one of the real problems with modern @entity80 politicsâ € ” and the @entity81 € ” is polarization , " @entity2 said			2
