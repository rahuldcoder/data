@entity0 -- the editor of @entity3 defended wednesday her recent hiring of a white fashion director -- a first for the 40 - year - old publication that celebrates black women			1
the hiring of @entity9 first sparked outrage when a former @entity3 employee posted a note on her @entity14 page decrying the decision			1
" it 's with a heavy heart i 've learned @entity3 has engaged a white fashion director , " former @entity3 staffer @entity16 wrote			0
" i love @entity3 and i love fashion			0
i hate this news and this feeling			0
" @entity3 editor - in - chief @entity24 wrote in an opinion piece posted wednesday on @entity27 news site @entity28 that @entity9 initially joined the magazine six months ago to run the fashion section on a freelance basis before being hired permanently as fashion director			1
" i got to see firsthand her creativity , her vision , the positive reader response to her work , and her enthusiasm and respect for the audience and our brand , " @entity33 said			0
" as such , i thought she 'd make an excellent addition to our team			1
this decision in no way diminishes my commitment to black women , our issues , our fights			1
" critics of the decision raised concerns over the lack of @entity27 - @entity27 women in fashion as part of their outcry over the hiring of @entity61			1
" the fashion industry is not diverse -- it is an elite , closed world and there is very little place for black women , " @entity62 told @entity1			1
" at @entity70 , there was one seat for @entity3			0
black women 's image and beauty has either been ignored or defiled and that one seat should be filled by someone who can represent the style , history and body type of black women			2
" @entity62 is adamant that she is not a racist , but instead concerned that a position where an @entity27 - @entity27 woman might be able to start and build her career has been lost			1
" @entity3 was the first magazine that says in their brand that it is for black women and their motto when i worked there was ' where black women come first , ' " @entity62 told @entity1 on wednesday			1
" this is not about being racist , this is about wanting a place where black women can grow and flourish and go out and help diversify , " she said			2
@entity33 said in her opinion piece that she shared concerns " about the lack of visibility of @entity27 - @entity27 women throughout the ranks of the fashion industry , which is overwhelmingly white			1
" " i , too , want to see more of us on the mastheads of all the magazines , seated in the front rows of the shows , designing our own fashion lines , and contributing our special flavor and flyness to the world of style , " she wrote			0
@entity33 also wrote that she has seen strong reactions in the past from readers when it comes to matters of race and the magazine			0
recent examples of reader outrage included a profile of rapper @entity124 and his longtime girlfriend @entity125 , which some readers found promoted having children out of wedlock and a negative image of black couples , and guest columnist @entity131 voicing her opinion about black men who date outside of their race , which some readers felt was reverse racism			0
likewise , the decision to hire @entity9 has not escaped scrutiny			2
however , despite the outrage , @entity62 insists that readers not drop their support of the magazine yet , writing in a second @entity14 post , " we need @entity3 today as we did 40 years ago			2
i do n't believe this is the time for a boycott			0
" @entity33 noted that past issues that should have sparked such outrage were often overlooked			0
she cites several in - depth reports the magazine conducted on issues plaguing the @entity27 - @entity27 community , including black children falling through the cracks in under - performing schools , the increase in sex trafficking of young black girls in urban communities , inequities in the health care services for black women or how @entity164 is the leading cause of death for black women ages 18 - 34			1
" the things that really are the end of our world apparently are n't , " she wrote			0
" while the response to these important stories may not always be as strong as we would like or lead to immediate change , @entity3 remains committed to telling these stories			2
" forty years ago @entity3 was founded to empower , celebrate , and inspire black women to climb higher , go further and break down barriers			2
our commitment to black women remains unchanged as we continue to stay laser - focused on those principles -- no matter who works with us			1
" @entity62 said she feels readers should still support @entity3 , but says there 's no reason why the magazine should be immune to criticism			0
" i hate that i 'm even having this conversation because i love @entity3 -- it was my home , " @entity62 said			0
" but i spoke out for all the black girls who called me crying because what does this say to them ? " meanwhile , @entity33 is standing by her decision to hire @entity9			2
" we remain committed to celebrating the unique beauty and style of @entity27 - @entity27 women in @entity3 and online at @entity201 , " she wrote			1
@entity1 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

the editor calls @entity9 " an excellent addition to our team "
her hiring sparked *controversy* when a former magazine employee posted on @entity14 that the hiring " hurts "
critics cite the lack of black women in fashion as part of their concerns
the editor says she remains committed to celebrating @entity27 - @entity27 women
