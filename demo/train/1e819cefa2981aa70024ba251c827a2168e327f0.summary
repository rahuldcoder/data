-- in the digital era , finding " the one " often involves finding the one dating app that is best suited for an individual 's lifestyle			1
research shows that as society becomes increasingly plugged in , attitudes have shifted positively toward finding love online			2
web dating is no longer associated with recluses hiding behind a computer screen			2
in fact , one in 10 @entity12 has used an online dating site or app , according to a 2013 @entity17 report on online relationships			1
with that shift , online dating has branched beyond algorithm - based matches to highly specific sites that can focus on any particular niche ( even farmers have their own dating site )			1
wanted : a part - time lover enter @entity28 , a dating app created for women by women that puts the ladies in the driver 's seat when it comes to shopping for an online connection			1
women control who sees their image , who can communicate with them and what type of date to pursue			2
ceo @entity43 and design director @entity44 created @entity28 based on the core principle that " women needed to control visibility , " @entity42 said , meaning the users can give clear signals that they 're actually interested and comfortable talking to the suitor of their choice			1
as online dating options have grown , @entity42 noticed that her friends ' frustration did , too : with every good introduction often came a slew of lewd ones			1
" i just started looking ( at online dating options ) and very quickly realized how many things are out there and how immediately my ' creepy meter ' went up , " @entity42 said			1
the subject has come to a head as users , particularly women , have started publicizing complaints of unsolicited sexual advances online			1
the 2013 @entity17 online dating report found that 28 % of online daters have been contacted " in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable , " with 42 % of female online daters experiencing this , compared with 17 % of men			1
this year , comedian and cracked writer @entity74 created the " world 's worst dating profile " on @entity79 to see how terrible an attractive woman would have to be to stop indecent introductions			1
@entity79 set up bad dates in ' an experiment ' with snippets like " i 'm really good at convincing people i 'm pregnant " and " my parents think i 'm in law school so they pay all my bills " alongside a model 's photograph , she still managed to get her fair share of boorish messages			0
artist @entity93 went so far as to draw artistic , nude interpretations of the off - color openers she received on @entity96 and then sent them back to the sender			0
how @entity96 picks your next match @entity42 says the app is not meant to be the counterpart to the " @entity103 " but instead a place for women to control their images -- whether because they are in a high - profile position or to simply ward off objectification			1
@entity42 likens the visibility functionality to a real - world interaction in which a woman makes eye contact or smiles as a signal of interest to a potential suitor			0
if the suitor ends up untoward , she can toggle her visibility in the same way she could decline conversation in a social setting			0
" the reason is n't necessarily that they needed more power over men ; they needed to feel safe and have fun , " @entity42 said			0
here 's how it works : when a user signs up for @entity28 , they 're prompted to take an in - app photo to ensure that " you really look and are like your profile , " @entity42 said			1
next , the user is prompted with an open - ended " question of the day			0
" the female users will see all the men who responded that day ; if a woman likes a man 's take , she can either choose to make herself visible to him or save his profile to scope out future responses and get a broader sense of his personality			0
" you 're trying to make strangers less strange , and in order to do that , you have to put something of yourself out there , " @entity42 said , adding that she hopes this gives a more complete , up - to - date personality portrait of a user than the typical profile list of likes and dislikes			0
on the flip side , a male user will see the female user 's answers without seeing a profile picture			0
if his interest is piqued , he can hit an option to notify @entity28			2
the app acts as a third party , alerting the woman that a user liked her answer and inviting her to check him out			0
the woman can ultimately decide to make herself visible			0
in addition , there 's the namesake " @entity28 " call : a woman can express what she wants in real time -- whether it 's drinks , a quick walk around the city or an activity hinted at with coy ellipses			2
" @entity28 's touchstones always reference what i discern works in real life , " @entity42 said			2
" give women the chance to send subtle cues of interest , men to show off a little of who they are , friends to recommend good men and people to make each other smile			2
" siren is part of a growing trend of apps that aim to take control of the online lechery and worse : hinge allows users to connect only with mutual friends and third - party connections on @entity207 ; willow users must answer questions before showing pictures ; @entity211 allows female users to invite only the men who they would want in the dating pool			1
with @entity28 , there 's also a vouching component : women can forward a man 's profile to friends for their opinion ; " wingwomen " can sign on without a public profile so they can help their friends in their search			1
" we 're cheering good men on in as many ways as we can , " @entity42 said			0
in beta testing , she says , some users submitted feedback that the functionality would be nice to have in other gender and sexuality groups , so they 're working on a version for the @entity237 community , as well			0
the app will launch its public version this week and will initially focus on the @entity241 area , where the startup is based , before expanding nationwide .			0

@entity28 is a new dating app created " for women by women "
the founders say the idea came about after friends ' complaints of lewd online *exchanges*
similar apps like @entity255 , @entity211 and @entity256 rely on other users ' vouching for potential suitors
