-- @entity2 officials and some members of @entity4 reacted strongly sunday to news that insurance giant @entity6 had intended to pay out $ 165 million in bonuses and compensation			1
the company has received at least $ 170 billion in federal bailout money			2
in a letter to the @entity2 , @entity6 chairman @entity12 , shown here in december , vows to curb bonuses			2
under pressure from the @entity16 , @entity6 scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or " retention payments " -- by at least 30 percent			1
that did little to temper outrage at the initial plan , however			0
in a letter sunday to treasury secretary @entity26 , @entity24 sen. @entity23 urged the @entity28 administration to explore " legal options " to prevent the millions in @entity6 payouts			2
" i write to ask why any bonuses would be legally required , given the company 's abysmal performance , " says @entity23 , @entity31			1
@entity23 asked whether the bonuses could be canceled or recouped from recipients , and whether the administration will sue @entity6 executives for breaching their duties to shareholders " there are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months , but what 's happened at @entity6 is the most outrageous , " @entity40 , head of the @entity41 , told @entity47 's " @entity46			2
" " what that company did , the way it was not regulated , the way no one was watching , what 's proved necessary , it is outrageous			2
" and on " @entity56 , " @entity2 economic adviser @entity55 said treasury secretary @entity26 was " really upset by the news			1
" " he stepped in and berated them , got them to reduce the bonuses following every legal means he has to do this , " @entity55 said			1
in a letter to @entity26 , obtained saturday by @entity0 , @entity6 chairman and ceo @entity12 said his company was taking steps to limit compensation in @entity69 -- the @entity70 - based unit responsible for issuing the risky credit default swaps that have brought the company to the brink of collapse			1
the default swaps amount to insurance against losses from bad loans , which have increased dramatically since the @entity24 housing boom peaked			2
in the letter to @entity26 , @entity80 said the unit 's 25 highest - paid contract employees will reduce their salaries to $ 1 this year and all other officers in the unit will reduce their salaries by 10 percent			1
other " non-cash compensation " will be reduced or eliminated			0
but he told @entity26 that some bonus payments are binding legal obligations of the company , and " there are serious legal , as well as business consequences for not paying			1
" rep. @entity93 , the chairman of the @entity94 , told @entity56 that bailout recipients should have to follow stricter compensation rules , and said @entity4 should look into whether the bonuses are " legally recoverable			0
" " we ca n't just violate legal obligations , i understand that , " the @entity101 @entity100 said			0
" but i do want to find out at what point these legal obligations were incurred			0
who said , and at what point , ' we 're going to give these bonuses no matter what ? ' and i do think it 's inappropriate for those people to stay in power at that company			1
" @entity93 said that if banks complain that the @entity28 administration has made things too tough , " they can give the money back			1
" @entity55 said @entity6 was following " a policy that 's really not sensible , is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people			0
" " we 've done exactly what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening again , " @entity55 said			0
@entity40 told @entity47 that the administration was taking " every legal step possible to limit those bonuses			0
" sen. @entity125 , @entity126 , told " @entity56 " he believes it 's important to know whether the bonuses are actually commission payments for products sold by brokers , saying he would withhold judgment until that is clarified			2
however , " i do think that these entities that are receiving government money , our money , i do think they have to play by a different set of rules , " @entity125 said			1
hopefully , those different rules will discourage companies from accepting bailout funds , he said			0
@entity80 , however , makes clear in the letter that he took steps to limit his employees ' compensation with trepidation			0
he said the company will have trouble attracting and retaining " the best and the brightest ... if employees believe that their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the @entity16			1
" @entity6 lost a record $ 62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008			0
it has more than 74 million insurance policies issued in 130 countries around the world			0
@entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			0

insurance firm 's vow to reduce , but not eliminate , some bonuses causes *uproar*
@entity16 's @entity26 said to be " really upset " and has " berated " company execs
*lawmaker* : if bailed - out entities do n't like government limits , " give the money back "
