@entity0 -- in 2008 , as the financial crisis reverberated around the globe , @entity2 worried how his business manufacturing parts for the auto industry would weather the downturn			1
but the @entity0 - based factory owner did n't look for ways to cut costs or hire a management expert			2
instead , he consulted a feng shui master , who recommended moving the factory gate from the south side to the west			1
" a lot of people went bankrupt that year but our sales doubled , " says @entity2 , the general manager of @entity17			2
@entity2 , who has been consulting feng shui masters for two decades , embodies @entity24 's embrace of the old and the new in its approach to doing business			1
he has an advanced degree in engineering from @entity29 in the @entity30 and employs 1,400 at a company that turns over $ 2 million a year			2
despite @entity34 skepticism , for him feng shui is an essential business tool			1
" i only believe in numbers but i have an open mind , " says @entity2			2
an ancient @entity39 system of boosting your luck through the positioning of objects and of predicting fortunes through dates and traditional texts , feng shui -- literally wind water -- is used in a variety of different ways			1
shopping malls , office towers and casinos across @entity24 draw on its principles in their design in an attempt to create prosperity			0
and individuals often consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married , give birth or move house			1
@entity2 says feng shui masters have helped him solve a variety of problems that have cropped up at his company , and , in some years , he has spent up to $ 100,000 on consultations			1
most recently , he sought advice on a staff issue after a number of long - serving technicians working at his factory in @entity39 left on bad terms			2
in a bid to get the compensation laid - off workers are entitled to , the technicians started turning up to work and doing nothing			0
@entity2 said he had little choice but to fire them and pay up			0
@entity81 up , he asked his feng shui adviser to pay a visit			1
he told @entity84 the toilet door faced the main entrance and the bad air flow meant people did not leave happily			0
" he said why do n't you build a wall to block the air flow , " said @entity2			0
" after the change , i did n't pay a penny more , " he said			0
at the behest of various feng shui masters , @entity2 has also changed the color of the blinds in his conference room from green to milky white and added an aquarium to his office			1
however , he has so far resisted advice to move his @entity0 head office from its current location : " that 's talking about real money			2
" @entity107 , the feng shui master who helped @entity2 with his staff problem , says that 60 % of his clients are businesses			1
the run - up to the @entity112 , which this year began on february 10 , is @entity107 's busiest time as clients want their " annual audit " to maximize their good fortune in the year to come			1
before meeting the client , he will study their office floor plan and log onto @entity120 to form a better understanding of the building 's location			0
" @entity124 deals with the natural environment			0
we try to harness the kind energy and avoid unkind energies , " he says			0
his advice ranges from the office layout to the right color of staff uniform to changing light bulbs and fixing cracked tables -- particularly if they are located in the southern corner of the office , which signifies fire and passion			0
he will also vet potential staff by looking at photos and birth dates			0
a person born in the summer months of a snake year is best suited to back office work , says @entity107 , referring to one of the 12 animals of the @entity148			0
" whereas if you are born in the year of the @entity151 , born in winter , these people need to be out front meeting people and being aggressive , " he adds			0
@entity107 is down - to - earth and his language is peppered with terms from his day job -- selling stocks and shares for an investment bank			0
his background in finance makes corporate clients more comfortable and none of his co-workers find his sideline strange , he says			0
watch : @entity124 in @entity0 office buildings @entity168 's clients also include multinational companies that find they have to take matters like feng shui seriously as they expand in @entity24			1
for example , auction house @entity172 only began work on its new office space in @entity0 last year after a feng shui master chose an auspicious date			1
and in @entity179 , the @entity178 has added a " feng shui awning " as part of a $ 760 million redevelopment			1
dr @entity183 , from the @entity184 in @entity185 , studies how feng shui can be used in urban design and architecture from what he calls a scientific stand point			1
he says there is " soft data " in the form of surveys and interviews that suggests buildings that adhere to feng shui principles make their occupants happier -- be it a shopping mall , office block or a hospital			1
and he points to the popularity of atriums or courtyards that bring the natural environment into a building as one way the principles of feng shui are manifested in modern architecture			1
@entity183 is skeptical of the cosmic claims of " popular " feng shui and says it 's an area that needs to be looked at more critically			1
@entity124 advice does not come cheap and there have been a number of scandals involving unscrupulous practitioners			0
@entity107 charges hk $ 10,000 ( $ 1,300 ) for a consultation for an office under 200 square foot and up to hk $ 50,000 ( $ 6,500 ) for a 2,000 to 5,000 square foot office			0
@entity2 says he has come across some bad masters			2
one adviser told him to paint his office walls black			0
another pedaled expensive feng shui objects			2
despite this , @entity2 has not been put off and will be making an appointment to see how he and his business will fare in the @entity231			2
" @entity124 can not make things happen but it can assist you and make things easier			0
