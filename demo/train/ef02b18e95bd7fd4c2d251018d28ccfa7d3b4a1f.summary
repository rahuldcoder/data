the man identifies himself as @entity12 leader @entity23			1
@entity25 officials disputed that claim on monday , arguing that @entity23 is dead			0
other experts say the notorious terror group leader is still alive			1
whoever the man in the video is , @entity25 's interior minister said , the country is n't interested in negotiating a swap anyway , according to @entity8			1
but at a later briefing , the director of the @entity36 , a government information ministry , said negotiations could be an option when it comes to rescuing the kidnapped girls			1
when asked whether all options were on the table , agency director @entity42 said yes			1
" the government of @entity25 will continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their respective homes , " @entity42 told @entity45			1

a senior administration official told @entity45 that @entity66 officials have no reason to question its authenticity			1
" our intelligence experts are combing over every detail of the video for clues that might help in the ongoing efforts ( to ) secure the release of the girls , " the official said			1

" by @entity5 , these girls will not leave our hands until you release our brothers in your prison , " he said			1
" you took our brothers four or five years ago , and now they are in your prisons			0

we will not let them go until you release our brothers			2
" but he also says he still plans to sell them into slavery			0

gov. @entity144 " views the development as encouraging , especially given the fact that some of the girls said they were not harmed , " his office said in a statement			2
" the governor hopes that the girls did not speak under duress			2
" despite the optimism , @entity126 said it will still be painfully difficult to find and rescue the girls after a month in the terror group 's custody			2

" we ran into the bush , " she said of her escape with two others			0
" we ran and we ran			0
" lost and terrified , she said , they later ran toward flames they presumed were rising from a building set ablaze by the militants in their hometown			0

if the government 's assertion turns out to be untrue , it would n't be the first time it has been wrong about the terror group since the girls ' abductions			2
