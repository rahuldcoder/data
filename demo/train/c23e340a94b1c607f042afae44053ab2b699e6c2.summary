" we 're going to go home and cry , " @entity3 said in a low voice			1

the pain ca n't wait for home			1
full coverage @entity28 updates @entity29 could n't wait either			0
the @entity31 , @entity32 , pediatrician sat in her car friday and wept because doctors at another nation 's hospital would not accept a truckload of food and water from her			1
nor would they let her pick up patients to take back to the @entity43 field hospital , where she 's been volunteering this week			1
" it 's so frustrating , " @entity29 said afterward			1
" why would they do that ? " there 's much crying in @entity1			2
there 's certain to be more once caregivers and others get home			1
for now , though , the work continues			0
@entity54 : list of missing , found are you there ? @entity29 had an increasing patient load at the hospital , located in a dusty field adjacent to the @entity62			0
a 5.9 - magnitude aftershock wednesday had given her new patients			2
even though @entity3 was trying to figure out how to get home , he still kept tending to patients being brought to a landing zone in three private helicopters			1
those helicopters belong to @entity9 businessman @entity71 , who offered to take a medical team to @entity1 after last week 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake killed tens of thousands and injured thousands more			1
@entity3 was a last - minute addition to a team put together by financial adviser @entity77 , a neighbor in @entity9			1
@entity77 had been to @entity1 on a mormon mission 20 years ago , along with @entity79 and @entity80 , now both @entity9 physicians			1
when @entity77 heard about the earthquake , he decided they needed to go			0
@entity79 and @entity80 readily agreed			0
they were dropped off monday at the coastal city of @entity86 , nearly 20 miles ( 30 kilometers ) west of @entity0			0
the city was at the epicenter of last week 's earthquake , and some reports say up to 90 percent of @entity86 's buildings were damaged or destroyed			2
impact your world the @entity95 doctors were among the first caregivers to arrive and were later joined by teams from @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and other nations			2
unlike what happened to @entity29 in @entity0 , everyone got along fine in @entity86			0
" it was like the @entity106 of medical work , " said @entity77			0
" there were no nationalities , " @entity3 said			0
they treated about 300 patients			2
the medicine was often rudimentary because of a lack of supplies			2
one doctor used a @entity117 tool to amputate a man 's lower leg			1
doctors also used a rack from the back of a bicycle as a makeshift orthopedic splint , screwing it into the patient 's leg bones			1
the days were long , bleeding deep into the night			2
sleep lasted three or four hours			0
" we worked until our headlamps ran out of batteries and then people would bring us batteries , " @entity3 said			0
" you can sleep when you 're dead , " he said			0
" and i 'll have plenty of time to sleep this weekend			0
" and , no doubt , have a good cry or two .			0
