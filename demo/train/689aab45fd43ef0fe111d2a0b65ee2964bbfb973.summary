she 's lost in space and struggles to try to make her way back to @entity12			0
" gravity " is just a film			0
imagine a similar real - life scenario : would there be any chance of survival ? that 's a concern for the @entity20 , or @entity21 , the @entity1 ' religious watchdog , for anyone who wishes to travel to @entity23			1
the @entity21 has issued a fatwa , or an official @entity26 ruling , to warn @entity27 against a @entity23 mission			1
so far , the @entity1 has supported space travel			2
@entity0 's @entity30 teamed up with @entity32 's @entity31 to create @entity33 to provide spaceflights for tourists , starting this year			0
but a mission to @entity23 , it seems , is one step too far			1
tourist trips to the @entity40 by 2043 ? the mission is being planned by the @entity42 nonprofit foundation @entity41			0
in april 2013 , it announced its ambitions to establish a human settlement on the @entity23 by 2025			2
but the @entity21 likens the journey to a suicide mission			1
on the authority 's free 24 - hour hotline , the issue was deliberated by the center 's specialized muftis , or scholars , who released the following statement : " it is not permissible to travel to @entity23 and never to return if there is no life on @entity23			1
the chances of dying are higher than living			0
" taking one 's life willingly is against @entity26 principles			1
in response , @entity41 issued a statement asking the @entity1 's @entity26 authorities to cancel the fatwa , saying every precaution would be taken to reduce the risk to life			1
" if we may be so bold : the @entity21 should not analyze the risk as they perceive it today , " the statement says			0
" the @entity21 should assess the potential risk for humans as if an unmanned habitable outpost is ready and waiting on @entity23			2
only when that outpost is established will human lives be risked in @entity41 's plan			0
" the statement includes a verse from the @entity78 that " encourages @entity27 to go out and see the signs of @entity81 's creation in the ' heavens and the earth			1
' " it goes on to say the first @entity23 settlers would walk in the footsteps of great @entity27 explorers like @entity88 , the 14th century @entity89 journeyman whose travels took him across @entity92 , the @entity93 and @entity94			1
indeed , space travel is n't alien to @entity27 culture			2
there have been @entity27 space explorers in the past			0
200,000 people apply to live on @entity23 the first ever @entity27 space tourist was @entity103 's prince @entity102 , when he joined the crew of @entity107 space shuttle discovery in 1985			1
in 2006 , @entity108 became the first @entity110 - born woman in space			0
and to help @entity27 observe religious obligations in space , the @entity113 government has been instrumental in setting up guidelines			2
in 2006 , @entity113 's national space agency @entity117 convened a conference of @entity26 scientists and scholars to address the religious obligations of @entity27 astronauts			1
the result was a detailed set of rules called " a guideline of @entity127 ( worship ) at the @entity129 ( @entity129 )			0
" it tackles a number of issues , like the number of times a @entity27 should observe daily prayers , when a day lasts just 90 minutes in orbit			0
@entity41 says 1,058 candidates have been shortlisted for the mission , from pool of more than 200,000 applicants around the world			0
