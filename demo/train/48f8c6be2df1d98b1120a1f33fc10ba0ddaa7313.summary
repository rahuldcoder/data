@entity2 , @entity1 for 18 years , thousands of students at the prestigious @entity1 took fake " paper classes , " and advisers funneled athletes into the program to keep them eligible , according to a scathing independent report released wednesday			1
" these counselors saw the paper classes and the artificially high grades they yielded as key to helping some student - athletes remain eligible , " @entity9 wrote in his report			1
he conducted an eight - month investigation into the scandal , which has plagued the university for nearly five years			0
four employees have been fired and five more disciplined because of their roles			0
one other former employee had honorary status removed , chancellor @entity22 said wednesday			0
@entity9 is the former federal prosecutor hired by @entity1 to independently investigate the academic fraud brought to light by @entity3 , the @entity27 and other media outlets			1
in all , the report estimates , at least 3,100 students took the paper classes , but adds the number " very likely falls far short of the true number			1
" for the first time since the scandal first came to light five years ago , @entity1 admitted that the wrongdoing went further than academics and involved its athletic programs			2
in fact , @entity22 said , " it was a university issue			0
" a stellar reputation comes crashing down @entity1 has long been a place where it was believed that athletics and academics went hand in hand			2
it has enjoyed a stellar reputation , producing basketball greats such as coach @entity50 and @entity51			0
now , that reputation has been stained			0
according to the report , one former head football coach , @entity52 , admitted to knowing of the paper classes and his successor , @entity55 , also admitted some knowledge			1
current men 's basketball coach @entity57 is steadfast that he did not know , @entity9 said			1
the detailed 131 - page report is being shared with the @entity60 and could have huge implications for the university			2
in the past 18 years , @entity1 has won three national championships for college basketball -- in 1993 , 2005 and 2009 -- that could be in jeopardy along with countless wins			1
and it was n't just the revenue - generating sports that benefited			0
the report says that athletes in a wide range of sports were involved , and it notes a noticeable spike of enrollment of olympic - sport athletes between 2003 and 2005			2
@entity1 in january : we failed students ' for years ' report spreads the blame around for five years , @entity1 has insisted the paper classes were the doing of one rogue professor : the department chair of the @entity83 , @entity84			1
@entity9 's report spread the blame much further			1
it also revealed that it was @entity84 's assistant , @entity88 , who actually created the paper classes out of sympathy for athletes and other students who were not " the best and the brightest			1
" @entity84 went along with them when he figured them out			0
@entity88 was such a fan of @entity1 sports , particularly basketball , that she would sometimes miss work after a loss , the report says			1
it was well - known on campus that @entity88 was a lax grader and gave high grades without regard for content , @entity9 said , emphasizing that she never gave a grade unless a student submitted a paper and did not change grades that were already given			1
@entity9 did find that five counselors actively used paper classes , calling them " gpa boosters , " and that at least two counselors , one in football , suggested to @entity88 the grade an athlete needed to receive to be able to continue to play			1
@entity84 was more hands off			0
he had initially held legitimate independent studies classes , @entity9 said , but was accused of " being an ass " by counselors who felt he was too hard on athletes			1
@entity88 then took it upon herself to create the first paper classes , naming @entity84 as the instructor even though she was managing all aspects of them : sending out paper topics , giving grades and assigning no meeting times			1
" it is not clear whether @entity88 ever got @entity84 's explicit approval to arrange these irregular independent studies			2
it is clear , however , that he ultimately learned about these classes and acquiesced in them by taking no action to put a halt to them			2
" when @entity88 announced she was retiring , there was a spike in enrollment in the last year of her classes , because football counselors urged student athletes to sign up			2
@entity88 actively tried to cover her activities , according to the report			0
@entity1 fake class scandal and @entity60 's response wind their way to @entity151 a strategy to keep players eligible former head football coach @entity52 admitted that he knew of the paper classes and said that former director of football @entity155 told him they were part of her strategy to keep players eligible			1
@entity155 , who is now an academic program coordinator at @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity163 , was one of four employees who refused to cooperate with @entity9 's investigation			1
the report shows that during @entity52 's years as head coach , there was a steady rise of enrollment of football players in the paper classes			1
@entity55 , who succeeded @entity52 as coach and was eventually fired in the wake of the scandal in 2011 , also admitted to knowing there were " easy classes , " @entity9 said			1
basketball coach @entity57 maintained he had no knowledge of the fraud , @entity9 said , which was supported by a drop in enrollment in the suspect classes by basketball players during his tenure			1
there were no findings regarding renowned coach @entity50 , who is ill with dementia			0
for health reasons , the @entity190 team was also unable to interview his longtime no. 2 and eventual successor , @entity194			0
the report does say that @entity50 's longtime academic adviser , the @entity197 , and her successor , @entity198 , knew about the paper classes			1
@entity197 , who died of cancer in 2004 , was a very close friend to @entity88 , the report says			0
during the @entity50 years , 1961 to 1997 , the report says there were 54 basketball players enrolled in paper classes			1
although the paper classes did start in the spring of 1993 , the year of @entity50 's final championship , grades would not have been entered until after the championship game was played			1
a whistleblower 's saga many of the academic - athletic staff who were named and implicated by @entity9 were also named by university learning specialist @entity214 , who went public with detailed allegations about paper classes and who , after a an all - out assault on her credibility by the university , has since filed a whistleblower suit			1
@entity3 interviewed @entity214 in january about her years working with student - athletes			0
she said that she had worked with dozens of athletes who came to @entity1 unable to read at an acceptable level , with some of them reading like elementary schoolchildren			1
she also said that there were many members of the athletic staff who knew about the paper classes , and her revelations contradicted what @entity1 had claimed for years -- that @entity84 acted alone in providing the paper classes			1
whistle - blower in @entity1 paper class case files lawsuit @entity214 said paper classes were openly discussed as a way to keep athletes eligible to play , and former football player @entity243 told @entity3 he was forced into majoring in african american studies , the department at the heart of the paper - classes scandal			1
@entity214 shared her reaction to the report with @entity3 on wednesday : " i did n't need @entity9 to validate me because the truth is validation enough , but i feel like what i 've said for the last five years is in the report			2
" i gave chancellor @entity22 credit ; she did a good job , " she said			0
@entity214 also said she believes it took so many years and six previous investigations because " this is the flagship of the university system and of the state , and to admit we did anything wrong was too difficult there is a level of arrogance here and that 's part of the culture			0
" refused to help in investigation @entity22 would not say who was fired or being disciplined			0
@entity9 , however , did name those who refused to cooperate , as : -- @entity273 , academic counselor for football 2002 - 2009			2
-- @entity275 , associate dean and director of academic advising			0
1999 - 2010 , who was the principle adviser for the men 's basketball team			0
-- @entity155 , director of football , 2002 - 2010			0
she was called a " critical witness			0
" -- @entity281 , interim head football coach in 2011			0
he 's now at @entity282			0
scandal has been unfolding for years the first hints of scandal began in 2010 , with allegations that some athletes were having improper contact with agents			0
as the university investigated , it found academic irregularities and finally announced , under pressure from the @entity27 newspaper in @entity295 , that there were classes where very little work was required			2
for the next five years , @entity1 administration was on the defensive , admitting only to allegations as they surfaced and never digging deep to the root of the problem			2
@entity9 said he found no evidence that administrators tried to cover up anything			2
he attributed the five - year delayed response to " insufficient appreciation of the scale of the problem			0
" six previous internally commissioned reports had stopped short of systemic accusations			0
@entity22 said that when she took the job as chancellor in october 2013 , she decided to hire @entity9 because there were still too many unanswered questions			2
" i wanted to be sure that we would n't have to do this again and again , " she said			0
@entity3 analysis : some college athletes play like adults , read like 5th graders			0

report by investigator found advisers funneled athletes to " paper classes "
3,100 students took those bogus classes , @entity9 's report finds
the report found the practice more *widespread* than many first thought
@entity1 's national championships could be on the line
