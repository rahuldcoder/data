-- someone conducted keyword searches on " chloroform " using a desktop computer located in the home @entity7 shared with her parents , a computer examiner testified wednesday in @entity10 's capital murder trial			1
the searches were found in a portion of the computer 's hard drive that indicated they had been deleted , detective @entity16 of the @entity17 testified			1
however , she told jurors , deleted material remains on a computer 's hard drive and can be retrieved until it is overwritten by new data			2
it had not been overwritten on the @entity24 ' computer , she said , and " a complete internet history " was obtained			2
@entity10 , 25 , faces seven counts in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity7 , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			1
the toddler 's family last saw her on june 16 , 2008 , but no one alerted police until july 15 , when the girl 's maternal grandmother tracked down the suspect and demanded answers			1
prosecutors allege @entity10 used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl 's mouth and nose			1
they allege @entity10 put her daughter 's body in her car trunk before disposing of it			1
@entity7 's skeletal remains were found in december 2008 , less than a mile from the home of @entity10 's parents			1
@entity10 has pleaded not guilty and denied having anything to do with her daughter 's death			1
defense attorney @entity61 has said that when all the facts are known , it will become clear his client is innocent			2
the searches using the keyword " chloroform " were conducted in march , three months before @entity7 disappeared , according to testimony			1
it appears the computer user first searched for " chloraform " on @entity71 and received results for " chloroform , " said @entity74 , owner of the software development company that created the software used to retrieve the data			1
one of the search results was from @entity79 , which was accessed , he testified			2
it also appeared searches were conducted using terms such as " inhalation , " " self - defense , " " meningeal artery , " " ruptured spleen , " " alcohol " and " head injury , " he said			1
the user either typed those terms in to search , @entity74 said , or in some instances might have clicked on links on the @entity79 site to go to a different page			2
searches were also conducted on " how to make chloroform , " " neck breaking " and " making weapons out of household products , " @entity74 testified			1
during his cross-examination , @entity61 attempted to show that the user apparently did not spend a great deal of time looking at the pages referencing chloroform			2
only a few seconds elapsed in some cases before the next site was accessed , @entity74 said			2
@entity74 agreed with @entity61 's assertion that the links do not tell jurors what was on the websites accessed , and that some could have been jokes or information on self - defense			1
he also agreed he could not say how closely the user was examining the websites or whether a user was looking at multiple browsers			2
while there were two user - created profiles on the computer , @entity122 told @entity61 she could not tell who performed the searches			1
she also testified she found no reference to chloroform on a computer belonging to @entity132 , @entity10 's former boyfriend			1
shown a photo @entity134 earlier admitted posting on his @entity136 page featuring a couple with the caption , " win her over with chloroform , " @entity122 said either it had been deleted and overwritten or posted from another computer			2
she said a keyword search would not necessarily have located the picture , since the keyword was embedded in pixels in the picture			0
@entity134 earlier testified he posted the photo as a joke			0
@entity122 said she also was asked to find any records on the computer relating to a @entity152			1
@entity10 told authorities @entity152 , who had been @entity7 's nanny for years , abducted her			1
@entity122 testified she found searches for @entity152 on people search sites , @entity71 and high school class reunion sites , along with the social networking site @entity136			1
all of those searches were conducted on july 16 , 2008 -- the day after @entity7 was reported missing to authorities , she testified			1
but @entity122 said she found no searches for @entity152 before that date , another blow to @entity10 's claims to authorities that she had been frantically searching for @entity164 and her daughter during the month before police were notified @entity7 was missing			1
@entity10 's former boyfriend , friends and acquaintances who saw her during that time recalled her shopping , eating out , going to parties and hitting nightclubs , but all of them testified she never mentioned her missing daughter and none of them noticed any change in her demeanor			1
her mother testified that @entity10 had moved out of her parents ' home about the time @entity7 went missing , offering little in the way of explanation , and that when she inquired after @entity7 , she was told she was with her nanny			1
police were never able to find the nanny			0
they did find a woman named @entity164 , who denied ever meeting @entity10 or @entity7 and later sued for defamation			1
earlier wednesday , jurors heard testimony that a second cadaver dog alerted to the potential scent of human remains in the backyard of the @entity10 home , but -- like the first dog -- failed to do so again once land in that area was disturbed			0
within three to four minutes of being given a command to search in the yard , " i saw there was an area of interest he kept going back to and sniffing pretty hard , " @entity203 , @entity204 , sheriff 's sgt. @entity202 said of her dog , bones			0
the dog made a second lap around the backyard and then gave his final alert -- sitting down , she said			0
the alert was within six to eight feet of that made the same day , july 17 , 2008 , by another cadaver dog , named @entity222 , @entity218 said -- although she did not find that out until afterward			1
she said she and @entity224 returned to the @entity10 home the following day , but several crime scene units were working there and " a lot of dirt , mulch , pavers ... changed the landscape quite a bit			0
" bones did not alert to any locations in the yard on the second search , she said			0
@entity238 also did not alert the second day , @entity222 ' handler , @entity237 sheriff 's deputy @entity236 , testified tuesday			0
@entity222 also alerted to the smell of human remains in the trunk of @entity10 's car , @entity236 testified tuesday			0
when the dog passed around @entity10 's white @entity246 on july 17 , 2008 , " he started indicating in the rear of the vehicle , " @entity236 said			1
" i could tell he was working something			0
" after the trunk was opened , @entity222 put his front paws inside and then lay down , signaling that he had detected the scent of remains			0
@entity236 explained the conflicting results in the @entity10 backyard by saying that he believed @entity222 alerted to a scent on the surface of the land			0
once technicians disturbed the surface , he said , the scent was diminished " where the dog would n't find it			0
it was gone at that point			0
" on cross-examination , however , @entity236 said he does not know the real reason behind the conflicting alerts			0
still , he said , " in every single time ( @entity222 has ) had an alert besides this case , he 's had a find , " that is , he found remains			1
@entity218 offered a similar explanation on wednesday			0
" whatever he was alerting to could have been moved or destroyed or dissipated because of all the work that had been done , " she said , " or they may just not have dug enough to find what was below the surface			0
" a crime scene investigator , the operator of a towing company and members of @entity10 's family all have testified they smelled a bad odor coming from @entity10 's car after it was found abandoned in a parking lot on june 27 , 2008 , and then towed four days later			1
a bag of trash found in the trunk , which had been sitting there for weeks during a @entity204 summer , has been suggested as a possible source of the odor			2
but @entity236 told @entity291 his dog does not alert on trash , and has been trained around garbage			0
@entity236 told @entity61 that he 's smelled human decomposition on numerous occasions and " i smelled it clear as day " in @entity10 's car			0
also tuesday , @entity297 forensic chemist @entity296 testified he analyzed pieces of @entity10 's trunk liner , carpet and parts of the spare tire cover , among other items			2
on those , he said , chloroform " residue " was found , but it was at low levels			2
but he did not want to offer specific levels , saying it would not be appropriate because he conducted qualitative testing , confirming chloroform 's presence , rather than quantitative testing , which would detect its level			0
under questioning from prosecutor @entity316 , @entity296 said the samples were sent to him in a cardboard box , not a sealed container , which could have allowed some of the chloroform to evaporate , lowering the levels present			0
having the car trunk open for a time might also lower the levels , he said			0
on monday , @entity326 , a senior research scientist at @entity328 's @entity327 , testified that the presence of chloroform on a carpet sample from the trunk was found at a " shockingly high " level -- far beyond what normally would be seen in environmental samples			2
both @entity326 and @entity296 tested the carpet inside the trunk			0
however , @entity326 , who is not a chemist , was attempting to find compounds associated with human decomposition			0
@entity296 was specifically testing for the presence of chloroform			0
@entity326 told jurors in the @entity345 courtroom that the presence of a decomposing human body is the only plausible explanation for the odor in @entity10 's trunk and the results found in forensic testing			2
in @entity354 's @entity353 contributed to this report			0
