-- " @entity1 is facing a devastating diagnosis : terminal brain cancer , " a people cover story from march started			1
" her doctors say she has as little as three months left to live			0
" then in august , the actress ' doctor told the " today " show that @entity1 was " pretty close to remission			2
" the media took it from there			0
yet after @entity1 was named a contestant on " @entity15 " on wednesday , she made a few clarifications			2
" i have lung cancer , " she told @entity0			1
" it is situated in the lining of the brain			0
it 's not even in the brain			2
" and " my lung cancer doctor says , ' @entity1 , we do n't even use remission			1
' " call it confusion over medical jargon			0
whatever it is , it 's an illustration of how much the term " cancer " confuses everyone			2
" i see a lot of people with ' brain cancer ' who actually have ... lung cancer , or breast cancer or some other cancer ( that spread ) to the brain , " said dr. @entity35 , chief medical and scientific officer for the @entity37			1
" we treat the cancer according to its origin			0
" in other words , doctors treat prostate cancer that has spread to a patient 's bones differently than they would treat bone cancer			1
@entity1 rose to fame playing @entity57 on " the @entity58 " and its spinoff " @entity60			2
" in 2009 , she was diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer			1
doctors removed the tumor and told @entity1 the cancer had not spread to other parts of her body			1
then in january , @entity1 spent a week in the hospital after falling ill during a play rehearsal			1
" the side of my face started to feel kind of numb			0
i was slurring my speech , " @entity1 told @entity71			2
doctors ruled out a stroke and continued to do more tests			0
shortly after , @entity1 was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , also called cerebral carcinomatosis			1
the cancer cells from her lungs had spread to the meninges , which is three layers of tissue that protect the central nervous system			2
think of it like a bag that contains the brain , spinal cord and spinal fluid			0
this metastasis happens in about 3 % to 5 % of non-small cell lung cancer patients , @entity35 said			1
" it is like little grains of rice sprinkled on the surface of the meninges when seen ( during an ) autopsy , " he said			0
" it is diagnosed in life with a spinal tap , and you find cancer cells in the spinal fluid			0
" it 's rare that someone does well with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , @entity35 said , which may explain why @entity1 's doctor said her current health " defies the odds			1
" but most outlets did n't publish the doctor 's following quote from the " today " piece : " the problem is that at any time this can change			0
" the treatment that @entity1 has undergone -- most likely chemotherapy administered through a spinal port , @entity35 said -- reportedly is working to slow the disease			1
but these cancer cells are adaptable and will develop resistance to the treatment			0
so short of a miracle , complete remission is n't in @entity1 's future			1
as the actress said , " it 's not a matter of if , but when			0
" @entity1 hopes you dance , too			0

@entity1 's lung cancer spread to the *membrane* system around her brain
she was diagnosed in january with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
expert : treatment reportedly is working to slow the disease , but cancer will continue to spread
