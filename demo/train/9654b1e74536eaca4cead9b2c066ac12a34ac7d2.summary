@entity0 says he 'll decide " in short order " if he will run for the @entity1 in 2016 -- and in a preview of what could become his campaign themes , the @entity2 is advocating a more active foreign policy and an overhaul of @entity9 entitlement programs			1
" i 'm thinking about running for president , and i 'll make up my mind in short order -- you know , not that far out into the future , i do n't know the exact time line , " @entity0 , the former @entity11 governor , brother of one president and son of another , said monday night at an event hosted by the @entity16			1
he said his decision on whether to seek the @entity2 nomination will hinge on whether he can " lift people 's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex , " and -- perhaps more importantly , he said -- whether " the sacrifice for my family is tolerable			0
" " i do n't know if i 'd be a good candidate or a bad one			0
i kind of know how a @entity2 can win , " he said			0
@entity0 added that @entity2 need to take a more positive approach in 2016 , and be practical enough about the national political landscape to " lose the primary to win the general " election			1
he then made a lengthy argument for a " more active and engaged foreign policy , " warning that a rebuilt military and aggressive intelligence gathering tactics are key to preventing " jihadist attacks			1
" " there is a growing sense that we ca n't withdraw from the world , " he said			0
@entity0 's position puts him at odds with more libertarian potential 2016 @entity2 hopefuls , like sen. @entity46 of @entity47 , who have criticized the @entity49 's surveillance efforts			1
he said intelligence tactics , the use of the military and other foreign policy issues , including free trade , could " probably become a bigger issue " in the 2016 campaign than he 'd expected several months ago			1
" the world is being disrupted , some in good ways and some in really bad ways , and but for us , there is no source of stability that allows that transformation to take place in a peaceful way , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 also delved into a host of domestic issues during his 45 - minute discussion with @entity71 , the @entity16 's @entity72 bureau chief -- on each one , eventually turning to the broader theme making the @entity9 " young and dynamic again			1
" on immigration , he argued for " an economically driven system " that would allow businesses to more easily move foreigners with the skills they need into the country			2
on energy , he said @entity81 could end its reliance on overseas oil in five years with an " all - in " policy that includes oil exploration on federal lands , approving the @entity87 , speeding up natural gas export terminal approvals and potentially allowing crude oil exports			2
he argued broadly for a simplified tax code and regulatory rules , and said education requires a " radical transformation			2
" " then we could actually do the other big thing , which is not going to happen any time soon , which is entitlement reform			0
... no developed country in the world has achieved this , and if we do it , we 'll be young and dynamic , " he said , adding that the @entity9 could join the ranks of rapidly developing economies like @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
" i think it 'll be the means by which we see a rising income for the middle class again			0
our spirits will be lifted , " he said .			0
