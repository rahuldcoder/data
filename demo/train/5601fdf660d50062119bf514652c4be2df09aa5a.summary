@entity0 -- dashing the hopes of @entity5 lawmakers sunday , sen. @entity2 signaled he would oppose a health care bill that includes a proposal to expand @entity8 to people as young as 55			1
the independent @entity11 senator has told senate majority leader @entity12 , @entity13 , that he would vote against the @entity8 at 55 proposal			1
he also said he would oppose cloture and work with the @entity17 if it ends up in the final version of the bill , two @entity5 sources told @entity1 sunday			0
unanimous @entity17 opposition so far means @entity21 need all 60 votes in their caucus , which includes @entity2 , to pass the sweeping bill			2
earlier , on the @entity32 program " @entity30 , " @entity2 and moderate @entity5 sen. @entity25 of @entity26 cited necessary changes to the bill before they would vote for it			1
@entity2 outlined steps that he said would ensure the bill passes the @entity21 with support from @entity21 and some @entity17			2
forget about the government - run public health insurance option , @entity2 said , as well as the @entity8 measure that was proposed last week as part of a package of alternatives to the public option			1
@entity2 's other conditions were eliminating a government insurance program focused on home health care for the disabled and strengthening cost - containment provisions			1
" we do n't need to keep adding on to the back of this horse until the horse breaks down and we get nothing done , " @entity2 said			0
a senior @entity21 @entity5 leadership aide told @entity1 that the " @entity5 leadership was shocked about how strident @entity2 was in his opposition to the @entity8 proposal when he went on the sunday shows			1
" however , @entity2 spokesman @entity57 said the senator first informed @entity12 on friday that he had concerns about the @entity8 buy - in and " reaffirmed it today			2
" @entity12 spend the afternoon trying to get the 60 votes , according to the aide , who said @entity21 still believe the @entity21 can produce a bill by @entity65 but acknowledged that they might have to look elsewhere for the 60 votes			2
@entity25 said he can not support the @entity21 bill without tighter restrictions on federal funding for abortion			2
the @entity21 last week defeated an amendment proposed by @entity25 and two other senators that would adopt the tougher language contained in the @entity76 health care bill			1
a compromise on the abortion language is possible , said @entity25 , one of 10 @entity21 who negotiated in private last week to seek a compromise to the equally controversial public option			0
the negotiators reached a tentative agreement on alternatives , including the @entity8 expansion to people 55 and older who lack health insurance , as well as allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage under government supervision			0
their agreement , hailed by president @entity94 and @entity5 leaders as an important step forward , still must be analyzed for its total cost by the nonpartisan @entity98			0
several @entity21 said sunday they would decide on the compromise once they get the @entity98 analysis			0
senate minority leader @entity101 , @entity102 , also on " @entity30 , " signaled continuing opposition to any health care bill even if @entity21 settle their differences			1
" we do not believe this bill , this nearly 2,100 - page monstrosity , is real health care reform , " @entity106 said			2
most democrats support the public option as a nonprofit competitor to private insurers that would expand coverage and bring down prices			0
republicans and some moderate @entity21 , along with the health insurance industry , oppose the public option , saying it would be a first step toward a government takeover of the entire health care system			1
the fate of the health care bill could hinge on the votes of as few as one senator from each party			0
if @entity21 can get 59 of their 60 caucus members to support the bill -- for example , by changing the abortion language to secure @entity25 's vote -- they can focus on gaining the vote of moderate @entity135 sen. @entity135 of @entity136 , who has signaled an openness to compromise			1
if the @entity21 eventually passes a health care bill , its version will have to be merged by a conference committee with the @entity76 version passed last month			1
the final bill would then need approval from both chambers before going to @entity94 to be signed into law			0
the president and @entity5 leaders have said they want the bill completed this year			0
the @entity21 would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule			0
@entity1 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0

sen. @entity2 says he expressed his opposition to sen. @entity12
@entity2 's vote on health care is crucial to @entity5 hopes of passing bill
@entity11 independent also rules out government - run insurance option
@entity76 has already passed health bill ; any @entity21 bill would have to be merged with it
