-- i was in @entity2 three years ago when the revolution began			1
i had not thought the january 25th protests would lead to very much			0
three years later , @entity6 greets the dawn of the anniversary with bombs , police violence , and nihilism			1
the revolution has become a struggle in a way no one dreamed at the time			0
it seems to be almost a revolutionary act to simply reject despair			0
in this despondent phase of the @entity6 tale , there are very few good guys , far too many bad guys , and a plethora of ugly guys			2
on the 25th of january three years ago , the divisions in the population were more or less clear			2
the ' bad guy ' was the regime of @entity31 , with all that implied			0
the corruption , police brutality , and overall degradation of human dignity in @entity6 society were clearly associated with his office			1
certainly , there were sections of the population that supported him -- in the aftermath of the uprising , 79 % of @entity6 said they supported the protests that led to @entity31 's departure			1
that left a sizeable minority which was uncertain of or opposed the protests			0
at the outset of the uprising , most @entity6 were unwilling to throw their weight behind the protests -- but they did not support @entity31			1
they just did not see much of an alternative			0
today , the divisions are far more complicated			0
that 79 % has become fragmented in ways that few predicted			0
those that backed the @entity60 forces of the @entity61 would feel great pride as confidence in its political party went from 15 % in the aftermath of the uprising , to a high of 67 % a year later			2
but they would also feel great disappointment : just prior to the june 30th ouster of @entity73 , @entity69 polls and others showed the political force of the @entity61 had lost most of its post-uprising popular support over its year in power			1
they are now designated as a terrorist organisation by the military backed interim government , albeit without conclusive public proof linking the group to terrorist attacks ( a separate terrorist movement , @entity87 , has claimed responsibility )			0
the @entity61 's political strategy has gone from trying to enforce authority over the state from within , to engaging in continuous protests against it from without			1
since the overthrow of @entity31 in 2011 , the military establishment has been the single most popular institution in the country			2
popular conscription means that members of most @entity6 families have served in it ; the educational system glorifies it , and most media in the country over the past three years has been at best lukewarm in its criticism of it			1
at its height over the past three years before @entity73 's ouster , public confidence in the military was anything from 80 % to 95 %			1
until @entity73 's departure , the @entity61 repressed disparagement of the army , and joined in its lionisation , identifying the army as supportive of @entity73 's rule			1
after it , one imagines the popularity of the military dropped with the departure of @entity61 support for it			1
given the loss of popular support for the @entity61 , and the overwhelming negative public media narrative about the same , it seems likely the military can still count on a majority of the population to back it			1
other political forces have , generally speaking , decided there is a binary choice to be made : back the @entity61 , or back the military			1
there was never much lost love between most other political forces and the @entity61			2
the latter already had enemies prior to coming to power , and alienated many potential ( and existing ) allies during the post-uprising period through its toleration of sectarian rhetoric , permissive attitude to vigilante violence , opposition to consensus building , and failure to enact reforms			0
it is difficult to describe most of these @entity152 forces as " liberal , " let alone " revolutionary , " however			0
the past six months have seen the largest number of civilian causalities at the hands of state forces in modern @entity6 history , as well as various other violations of civil rights			1
most of these forces have either been silent or actively supportive of such efforts in @entity6 's own " @entity163 , " although they objected greatly to other abuses during @entity73 's tenure			1
on the third anniversary of the revolutionary uprising , that leaves one group left to account for -- the group that sparked it in the first place , and continued to fight for it without regard for partisan political interest			0
those original " jan25 revolutionaries , " made up of rights campaigners , civil society activists and others , had no plan during that 18 day uprising -- except to persist and persevere			1
they were joined by many others -- and no - one can now claim the uprising was theirs alone			0
the crowds that swept into the different squares of @entity6 over those days were representative of @entity6 society in general -- not simply one sector of it			2
but that portion of society that sparked the protests , those who continued to agitate for fundamental change , and to criticise , irrespective of who sat in the presidential palace -- they 've already realised that just as they were on the margins on january 25 2011 , they 're still on them in 2014			2
three years later , many of them have been arrested for dissent against the current government			0
many had gone into political parties , but they never reached critical mass. what they did have -- what they do have -- is this strange perseverance to continue speaking truth to power			0
on january 25 2014 , some may go out to remember the uprising where so many @entity6 decided to join them			2
mostly , however , they 'll probably take a deep breath as they see most @entity6 fall prey to an ultra-nationalism on the one hand , and a sectarian partisanship on the other			2
back to the margins they may have gone -- but into oblivion , they refuse to go			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0

@entity6 's revolution has shown clear fault lines in society , says @entity225
@entity61 gained *impressive* support , and *squandered* it almost as *quickly*
@entity225 : military remains popular , despite civil rights violations in @entity6 's " @entity163 "
*pro-revolution* activists and rights campaigners on the margins , three years on
