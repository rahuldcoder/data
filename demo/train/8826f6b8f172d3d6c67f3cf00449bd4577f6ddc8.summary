-- three years ago , obsession took hold of @entity3 in @entity4			0
in the third week of january 2011 , @entity6 's newly - elected @entity5 held its first - ever vote to repeal the @entity8 and go back to letting insurance companies do whatever they want			0
fast forward to today -- nearly 50 votes to repeal or undermine the law later -- and it 's clear to the @entity15 people that @entity3 in @entity4 are n't on their side			1
pick an issue : @entity18			0
the list of failures , neglected issues and missed opportunities goes on and on -- and shows without question that @entity3 are on the side of special interests and the @entity32 , not the @entity15 people			1
no wonder poll after poll still shows @entity3 standing at record lows			0
@entity15 do n't need a pen and a phone , we need a job and a paycheck @entity6 's misguided agenda and one - note tenure have ignored what the @entity15 people want			1
in fact , independent , mainstream polls show that most @entity15 want to improve and fix the law , not repeal it			2
@entity15 know what repeal would cost them : giving the power back to insurance companies to discriminate , deny care , drop coverage , raise rates and drive hardworking @entity15 into bankruptcy			1
on the @entity8 and so many other issues that matter to the middle class , the message @entity56 have sent is clear : they are not on the side of hardworking @entity15 middle class families , and instead will do everything in their power to protect those who need help the least : the @entity67 special interests			1
@entity68 , the pain and fear must be named while @entity5 @entity3 have obsessively voted to turn our health care system back over to insurance companies , that is far from the only damage they have inflicted on the people of this country			2
their disastrous government shutdown -- which they launched to oppose the @entity8 -- cost our economy $ 24 billion			0
they wo n't extend unemployment insurance for struggling @entity15 who lost their jobs through no fault of their own and who are looking for work -- all while they make sure that @entity87 gets its $ 40 billion in subsidies			1
they refuse to raise the minimum wage , while seeking maximum tax cuts for the rich			0
they have yet to pass anything that remotely resembles a jobs bill			0
those wrong priorities will come back to haunt them in november			1
a few republicans are making the first motions to run away from this unpopular approach and to deny their repeal - only agenda			0
they 're hoping that voters will think that they 've woken up and found some common sense -- but voters wo n't forget nearly 50 votes , and they wo n't forgive them for turning their backs on hardworking people			2
this year 's @entity106 is a defining test for @entity68 @entity3 ' flawed priorities are hurting real families in this country			0
with every repeal vote , @entity6 might get a kick out of conservative news headlines and the talk radio echo chamber , but what regular @entity15 see is a politician who cares more about wealthy insurance company contributors than helping their families			2
voters will have a choice this fall between @entity3 ' wrong priorities , and problem - solving @entity122 who have dedicated their lives to helping middle class families get ahead			1
i believe that choice will be clear			0
@entity68 's message : a dysfunctional @entity4 , but we 'll get it done anyway the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rep. @entity132 .			1

rep. @entity132 *rattles* off a list of @entity136 failures , neglected issues and missed opportunities
@entity140 : party showed they were n't on the side of the @entity15 people
@entity140 : their wrong priorities will come back to haunt them in november
