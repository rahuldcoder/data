" you could tell he 'd been though a difficult situation and that he was sorry that he hurt other people , but he was also able to keep it funny , throw humor into it too , " @entity15 said			0
@entity4 revealed on his show thursday night he had sex with members of his staff and that he testified about those liaisons before a @entity0 grand jury for a case involving an alleged attempted extortion			2

" the staff here has been wonderfully supportive to me , not just through this furor , but through all the years that we 've been on television			0

" now the other thing is my wife , @entity51			0
she has been horribly hurt by my behavior , and when something happens like that , if you hurt a person and it 's your responsibility , you try to fix it			0
and at that point , there 's only two things that can happen : either you 're going to make some progress and get it fixed , or you 're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed , so let me tell you folks , i got my work cut out for me			1
" another audience member said @entity4 's apology to his wife appeared to evoke sympathy from some in the crowd			1
" when he made the apology to his wife he was very serious , not looking for any laughs , when he said he had a lot of work -- a lot of work to do on the homefront , " said a man who identified himself as @entity73			1
" that was very heartfelt , a lot of women in the crowd -- i could hear them literally saying , ' awww , ' that they felt for @entity4 and the dilemma he 's probably going through			2
