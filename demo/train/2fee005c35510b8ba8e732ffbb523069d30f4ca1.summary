in late 2012 , the @entity39 clashed with the @entity46 leader of the @entity47 , which had run the camp			2
the regime still maintains control of camp entrances , and armed groups fighting near the entrances have prevented aid from entering			1
@entity30 talks off to ' good beginning , ' @entity55 mediator says ' we are dying , slowly ' " today is the 180th day that food has not been allowed in @entity17 , " activist and resident who goes by the @entity60 said			1

" according to estimates from the @entity86 , there were 160,000 @entity126 refugees in the @entity127 before the fighting began , and 18,000 remain			1
opinion : @entity130 , forget about ousting @entity43 it 's difficult to leave for residents who can afford to leave , their @entity126 refugee status makes travel very difficult			1
" our passports are @entity30 - @entity126 passports			2
we can leave @entity30 , but we ca n't enter @entity136			0
even if we could ( leave the camp ) , we can not go to @entity138 without a visa , and @entity140 will never let us in			0
we can not go to @entity141			0
to go to @entity142 , we need visas			0
we have no embassies in @entity30 , but @entity145 will not let us in unless we have already a visa ( to somewhere else ) , since we are only allowed a 48 - hour transit visa in @entity145 , " @entity60 said			0
@entity17 has seen widespread cases of " malnutrition and the absence of medical care , including for those who have severe conflict - related injuries , and including for women in childbirth , with fatal consequences for some women			1
residents including infants and children are subsisting for long periods on diets of stale vegetables , herbs , powdered tomato paste , animal feed and cooking spices dissolved in water , " @entity101 said			0
" the hijacking of @entity127 in @entity18 by armed groups that have practiced and still practice methodical terrorism constitutes a war crime against humanity , " @entity126 labor minister @entity169 said on a visit to @entity18 , according to the @entity30 state - run @entity172 news agency			1
" there has been an appalling absence of electricity and heating for horrendously long periods , now close to one year , with all ( that ) this implies for poor health			0
residents are having to rely on going out on terraces and burning furniture and branches to warm themselves in the open because wood fires can not be resorted to indoors , " @entity101 said			0
" the scale of the crisis in @entity30 , with millions of civilians affected , is staggering and the humanitarian response insufficient , " @entity198 , president of the @entity199 , said monday , at the end of a three - day visit to the country			0

" if they are n't fighting for us , they should leave			0
" the camp " remains a place where extreme human suffering in primitively harsh conditions is the norm for @entity126 and @entity30 civilians living there			1
