-- it is the place where the " @entity3 " chant was invented			0
it is or has been home to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			0
a man once distracted an opponent 's free - throw shooter by rising from his seat and dancing while wearing a dark blue @entity13 and nothing else			0
that guy became a pastor			0
the college basketball fans at @entity19 , where there are just 9,314 seats , are not only known for being loud , they take pride in getting into opponents ' heads			1
they are a coordinated cacophony that gives the @entity26 a home - court advantage only a handful of teams have			1
@entity30 has won nearly 84 % of its games in @entity32 since 1940			2
the @entity33 are so famous , they were even in a @entity35 commercial			1
but recently , the young fans have been the subject of scorn from former crazies , other basketball fans , the media and even @entity26 's legendary coach , @entity42			1
they have n't been their old selves , and they have n't been filling the undergraduate students section , not even to cheer on a top - 10 team			1
@entity26 has 1,000 spots for undergrads but has sold up to 400 of those seats to other @entity26 fans this year			1
as @entity26 enters the heart of conference play , student attendance has picked up recently , senior @entity50 , one of two student ticket line monitors , said in an e-mail			1
the smaller undergrad crowds is not a new trend ; there have been fewer of them in @entity59 for the past few seasons			0
but this season , the lack of passion has been noticeable			0
coach @entity64 had these words after a january victory at @entity68 , according to the @entity69 : " this team is trying to develop and do n't just watch them , be with them			0
this saturday let 's be out there at noon [ they won against @entity79 's ] and be the @entity33			1
if you do n't want to do it , then do n't , but it will be a mistake			0
i think sometimes you just take things for granted			0
" the students responded to the coach 's call ; @entity87 said @entity88 was over capacity			2
longtime @entity26 fan @entity90 says there are several reasons @entity32 is a different place these days			1
@entity90 -- who grew up in @entity94 , has seen hundreds of games in @entity32 and runs the message board forum @entity97 -- points a finger at a tech - rich culture , a student body more focused on academics , conference expansion and the team 's " ridiculous success			1
" no question @entity26 is one of the most beloved teams and one of the most hated -- in large part because it wins so much			1
with four national titles and fourth place on the all - time victories list , the @entity26 are on tv and the front pages of newspapers and sports websites constantly			1
" people get spoiled ; they get used to ( winning ) , " @entity90 said			0
" but the secret of @entity32 , and people who have n't been around a while do n't realize , but @entity32 really became a great place out of frustration			0
" he explained that in the 1970s , other teams came in with their stars -- @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127 of @entity68 and @entity128 of @entity129 -- and whipped @entity26 's butt			1
since there was no beating them on the court , @entity26 fans turned to making fun of them , @entity90 said			1
and those fans , including the most raucous ones known as @entity8 , were often hilarious and often downright offensive			2
@entity138 , columnist for the @entity139 in @entity140 , said the fans sometimes crossed the line , but they were spontaneous			1
" they 've turned into the @entity144 , " he said			0
everybody knows exactly what 's next			0
" at @entity26 , students will work on a cheer sheet and hand them out to those who attend games			1
some students have complained that new cheers are needed			2
they also say there needs to be better coordination			0
there are other factors at play , king and @entity138 said , and these could affect all schools			0
in the early 1980s , when @entity42 was new to @entity26 and the @entity26 were beginning to win consistently again , there were no fans texting on cellphones or updating @entity166 pages , @entity138 said			1
sure , some brought books so they could study during breaks , but their attention spans were longer and more focused on basketball			2
these days , not so much			0
there also were no huge tvs in the dorms , where students do n't have to wait for hours in cold lines to get into the arena , where they might stand ( or jump up and down ) in closer - than - close quarters for three - plus hours			2
today 's students can also watch anywhere on campus on computers or smartphones			2
and there are now 12 teams in the @entity186 ( two more schools join the league next season ) , and old school rivalries have been diminished as a result , said @entity138 , who has seen more than 300 games in @entity32 since 1957			2
like many superconferences , the @entity186 has grown so big that schools sometimes play conference opponents only once a year instead of twice			2
for @entity26 , it means people do n't care about some games as much anymore , @entity90 said			1
it 's hard to get worked up about a revenge game if a year separates a loss and the next contest			0
things will get better , @entity204 , a former crazy known as @entity205 , wrote in a letter to @entity26 fans on @entity97			1
" you may think that the @entity209 are n't up to the standards of the past , but maybe this current crop is merely going through its own growing pains , " he wrote			0
" maybe they are n't spoiled and complacent			0
maybe they are learning on the job			0
" @entity87 wrote that students were anxious to be part of the tradition			2
" people are painting up , making signs , and counting down the minutes until the doors to cameron open , " she said			0
a betting man would probably wager that @entity88 will be full on saturday when @entity26 is host to @entity68 , which fancies itself one of @entity26 's rivals ( @entity26 fans feel a little differently )			1
coming off a miraculous comeback win against the no. 5 @entity229 , @entity26 and its crazies have to have their swagger back			1
if the spontaneity and enthusiasm return with it , the @entity232 might just want to invest in some earplugs			2
and the @entity229 , when they come march 3 , well , it 'll be as crazy that day as ever in @entity32 .			0

there are 1,000 seats for undergraduate students at @entity26 basketball games
many of those seats have been sold to *non-student* @entity26 fans
success , conference *dilution* and *technology* have role in *downtown* , fan says
@entity33 need the spontaneity back , says *veteran* sports columnist
