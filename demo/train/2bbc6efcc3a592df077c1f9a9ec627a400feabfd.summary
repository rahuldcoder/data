@entity0 , @entity1 -- " this one is for you , " says @entity5 , the photo manager at the @entity6			1
she hands over a blue , numbered armband - come - sleeve which signifies to all at the @entity9 venue that its wearer is a working photographer			2
" let me take your name as well , we might need it if i have to take away your accreditation , " she adds with a smile , before revealing the fate of a photographer who recently made the mistake of crossing into a no - go zone			2
" he ran onto the landing area of the ski jump to help an athlete who had fallen ... it was dangerous and against the rules , so last i heard he 'd been barred from the rest of the @entity31			2
" the message has the desired effect on a writer adopting the role of photographer for one night only			0
consequently , careful attention is paid to the briefing that @entity5 leads 10 minutes later			0
safety is the key , and it 's made clear where we should not trespass if we want to stay on her good side			0
she refers to a map of the giant jump center where photographer positions are labeled and then fields questions from the 20 - or - so snappers present who will be recording tonight 's event for countless newspapers , websites and magazines around the world			1
@entity57 nods and takes in the information , assessing the potential of the various options being discussed for his specific task			1
as a specialist for photo agency @entity64 who creates 360 - degree images , he needs to consider different aspects for successful delivery			1
" at the ski jump , there 's quite a lot of behind - the - scenes stuff which is n't very pretty			1
we need to chose a position that will optimize the panorama , " @entity57 tells @entity2			2
" so often what makes a brilliant photo in normal circumstances is wasted in a 360 because half of the picture is just snow , or mountains or mud , and it 's not that interesting			2
we 're trying to get a picture that will be interesting from every angle			0
" and with that we pick up our kit , swallow the final mouthfuls of @entity1 stew from the press - room kitchen and head outside to the bottom of the usually out - of - bounds chairlift that takes athletes and a select number of the media to the top of the looming slopes			1
the @entity99 is one of the most spectacular venues at the @entity9 , where two giant steel structures bolted to the northern slope of @entity104 create the artificial angle and curves needed to propel brave athletes on a skywards trajectory			0
the chairlift scoops up photographers two at a time and heads up the mountain side pulled by its cable , leaving legs swinging in the cool air			0
once at the top the work begins to assess the three positions available for the photographers to use for the ski jumping qualification that is due to start on the " @entity120 " in half an hour			0
the location at the top of the smaller slope will not be close enough to the action , despite the proximity to its dramatic plunge , so we walk down the wooden steps that bisect the two runways to a spot more suitable			0
" so here , on the southeast side of the jump , just by the kickoff lip , has a good view of the valley -- which means the other 180 degrees i can fill with multiple frames of the skier at different points all the way down the hill , " explains @entity57 , as he puts down his bag to survey the surroundings			1
" you also need to be careful of the tv cameras , so you do n't get in any of their shots , " he adds pointing to the bank of cameras who have their focus trained across our heads towards the launch area			0
" it 's always an issue for me because i have a three - meter - long pole with a camera fixed to the end			0
it gives you a really good perspective but you need to be wary about getting in the way of other people			0
" @entity57 extends the carbon - fiber monopod to about two and a half meters			1
on the end of the pole his camera is fitted with a collared , very wide fish - eye lens that is controlled by a remote in his hand			0
as the skiers begin to whoosh past to spring into the night sky he rotates the camera around a " nodal point " firing the aperture into action			0
he takes four wide shots before concentrating on specific details needed for the final composite			1
" i want to try to get in the picture the sense of the steepness and the speed of the skier , so that 's the challenge for today , " @entity57 says			1
" i can trigger ( the camera ) to get multiple frames of the skier taking the jump , so we 'll have the whole story from top to bottom which i 'll then overlay on the panorama			1
i 'll take around 40 pictures per jump but will probably only use around 20 in the final composite image			1
" with the crowd shots i used a different exposure to capture more of the detail -- the skier is a darker exposure with a faster shutter speed , which has to be adjusted for too			2
" especially because the floodlights here actually flicker , the human eye ca n't pick it up because it 's too quick , but the camera does , and it makes a difference to the light on the shot			0
the final composite will be an amalgam of all the shots			1
" with the pictures captured , we begin the long journey down the vertiginous steps that run alongside the jump slope back down to the press center			2
once there the laptop is unfolded and a program fired up that , with the help of algorithms and blending tools , stitches together the many images into one panorama			0
" the tools are fantastic for taking distortion out of the lens , lining the images up and detecting where they match -- they 'll detect points that are exactly the same in two images ... and will line up from these control points -- it does a lot of the heavy lifting for you but it also makes lots of mistakes which i then fix by hand , " says @entity57 as he manipulates the final product before filing down to @entity64 offices in time for the deadline			1
it seems athletes are n't the only individuals working on an aesthetic performance in the mountains of @entity0 .			2
