-- a @entity2 court sentenced a pregnant 27 year old woman , called @entity4 , to death this week			1
her crime was she fell in love and married a @entity9 man and affirmed her faith in @entity11			1
she was subsequently accused , and convicted , of apostasy , since the court in @entity14 regards her as a @entity15 even though she was raised @entity9 by her mother after her @entity15 father left when she was six years old			1
since the court does not recognise her marriage to a non-muslim either , she has also been convicted of adultery and sentenced to 100 lashes			1
as disturbing as the above story may be , unfortunately it does not come as a surprise			1
countries such as @entity2 , @entity27 and more recently @entity28 are increasingly lurching towards archaic and inane interpretations of @entity30 and applying laws that undermine basic human rights and equality			1
this not only puts them at odds with the modern world , it puts them at odds with the trajectory progressive @entity15 thinkers and reformists have been travelling in for the last 200 years			0
the idea that @entity15 who leave @entity44 should be killed is prominent in medieval jurisprudential texts that were written at a time when religious faith and political allegiance were inextricably linked			2
hence , leaving the faith was deemed treason and construed as an act of rebellion against political authorities			2
as @entity15 political empires became more diverse , conceptions of political allegiance began to change and in 1844 , the @entity57 abolished the death penalty for apostasy from @entity44			2
@entity60 in @entity61 , the world 's most influential @entity63 religious authority , followed suit in 1958 and issued a formal fatwa ( religious edict ) abolishing the death penalty for apostasy			2
apostasy laws also blatantly contradict the @entity70 ( @entity71 ) which was introduced in 1948 and signed by most muslim - majority countries at the time			2
however , the so - called " @entity75 , " issued by @entity76 ( @entity76 ) foreign ministers in 1990 , contains the following clauses : " @entity78 : @entity44 is the religion of unspoiled nature			0
it is prohibited to exercise any form of compulsion on man or to exploit his poverty or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to atheism			0
" " @entity89 ( a ) : everyone shall have the right to express his opinion freely in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the @entity30			1
" " @entity95 : the @entity96 is the only source of reference for the explanation or clarification to any of the articles of this @entity70			0
" the last two articles of this bizarre and highly - politicized declaration , allow muslim - majority countries to violate the udhr by invoking the @entity30 as though there was a unified version of it			1
not only is there no single interpretation of @entity30 , but certain muslim - majority countries seem adamant on re-invigorating some of the most regressive and outmoded interpretations of it in an almost defiant and aggressive manner			1
this lurch towards medievalism is largely driven by the global @entity118 movement , which was born in 1928 when the @entity119 was established , and gained real momentum after the @entity122 revolution in 1979			0
the current regime in @entity2 , which seized power after a military coup in 1989 , has systematically used @entity118 to silence domestic dissent			1
they have even reached out to @entity118 militant groups in the region and hosted the @entity131 leader , @entity130 , in the early 1990s			0
the global @entity118 movement seeks a much greater role for @entity44 in the political sphere and , in its political stances , is defined by its opposition to the @entity136			0
in synchronizing a medieval interpretation of @entity44 with politics , this movement seeks to challenge and reverse progress on human rights and equality that has been made in recent decades			0
hence , we are witnessing the introduction of increasingly antiquated laws that discriminate and undermine basic rights			0
it is time for the @entity75 to be revoked and for the @entity15 human rights discourse to catch up with , and contribute as an equal partner to , modern international human rights discourse			0
it is also time for human rights groups and the international community to take a strong stance against any state that violates the rights of ordinary citizens for making choices the rest of us take for granted .			0
