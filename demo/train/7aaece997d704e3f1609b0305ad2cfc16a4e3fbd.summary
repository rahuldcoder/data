-- in his 11 years in charge at @entity3 , @entity1 never witnessed an @entity5 victory at @entity6			1
at least now he can scratch that off his ' to do list '			0
a 1 - 0 home defeat by his former employer courtesy of @entity12 's 86th minute strike means @entity13 is now 12 points adrift of league leader @entity15 after just 14 games of the season			1
" i 'm very disappointed , " @entity13 manager @entity1 told @entity19 following wednesday 's game			1
" we needed a bit of good fortune and we did n't get it			0
@entity5 kept at it and showed us what a good team they are			1
" we did n't defend the goal well enough so it was our own doing			0
we had some chances as well , as did @entity5			2
they have been playing well and that 's why they are up near the top of the league			0
" it was n't about me tonight , i was fortunate to manage @entity5 and i 'm fortunate to be managing @entity13			1
it 's a big catch up for us now			0
" @entity1 was left frustrated after his side , which included former @entity5 midfielder @entity37 , failed to fire			2
it was @entity5 's first success on the red half of @entity40 since 1992 but it could scarcely have come at a better time for @entity43 's side			2
when @entity1 left @entity3 to replace @entity45 at the end of last season , much of the talk was how @entity13 would move forward			2
instead , it is @entity5 which has moved on -- climbing to fifth in the table while playing a far more expansive brand of football			2
" it was a big battle today , " @entity43 told @entity19			0
" we were outstanding at playing @entity13 eye - to - eye			1
" it is fair to say we did expect @entity13 to have their chances , but we were very confident with @entity57 and our defenders			2
" as an away team , you normally feel you will have only one or two chances maximum			0
but with our ambition , we created many , many chances			0
" if you look at the overall position we deserved all three points and that is an incredible statement			0
" while @entity5 was busy pulling off a stunning win , @entity71 neighbor @entity69 was also in the midst of something special as @entity75 scored four times in his side 's 5 - 1 mauling of @entity79			1
@entity75 , who has now 11 goals against @entity79 in four appearances , including three hat - tricks , took his career tally to 51 @entity85 goals			1
@entity86 rounded off the scoring to leave @entity69 in fourth -- seven points off the top			2
elsewhere , @entity15 remains four points clear at the top of the table following a comfortable 2 - 0 home win over @entity94			1
@entity95 gave the home side an early lead before @entity98 sealed the win in the second half			0
@entity102 's men sit above @entity103 which earned a 4 - 3 win at @entity105			1
@entity106 scored twice and @entity107 was also on target in a seven - goal thriller			0
@entity110 remains in the hunt following a 3 - 2 win at @entity113			1
@entity94 , which is currently third , survived a late fightback after sailing into a three - goal lead with @entity116 's double adding to @entity118 's opener			0
elsewhere , @entity120 claimed a 2 - 1 win at @entity122 , @entity119 beat @entity123 3 - 2 while @entity124 claimed a point at @entity126 following a goalless draw			1
@entity128 in @entity128 , @entity129 suffered a shock 2 - 0 defeat at @entity132 as it failed to equal the record for its longest unbeaten streak in the top flight			1
@entity129 entered the contest unbeaten in 26 previous league matches , one short of the record set by the title winning side of 1993 - 94			1
it had also hoped to equal the overall run of 36 games without defeat in all competitions -- a streak which does not include the penalty shoot - out defeat by @entity132 in last season 's @entity147			2
again it was @entity132 which proved to be @entity129 's undoing with @entity151 and on - loan @entity153 winger @entity152 doing the damage late on			1
@entity129 is now just a point clear of @entity156 at the top of the table and two clear of third place @entity159			0
@entity161 @entity162 booked its place in the last eight of the @entity165 with a 2 - 0 win at @entity167 , despite losing winger @entity168 to injury			1
@entity168 , who opened the scoring after just four minutes , was forced out of the tie following a collision with @entity167 keeper @entity173			0
the @entity175 's replacement , @entity176 , scored his side 's second 12 minutes from time to seal the win			0
elsewhere , there were wins for @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 .			0

@entity13 beaten 1 - 0 at home by @entity5
@entity75 scores four as @entity69 crushes @entity79 5 - 1
victories for @entity15 , @entity110 and @entity103
@entity129 loses unbeaten run in @entity128
