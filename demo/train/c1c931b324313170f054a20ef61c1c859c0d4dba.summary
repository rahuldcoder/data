-- actress @entity1 is passionate about food , and she recently used her cooking skills to raise money for @entity5 , a @entity6 - based organization that helps the homeless			1
@entity1 is also an enthusiastic supporter of @entity8 , and she recently sat down with @entity0 senior producer @entity9 to talk about the campaign and her philanthropy			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity9 : why did you decide to get involved with the feeding the homeless ? @entity1 : i grew up on food stamps			1
i come from a very humble background			1
and i 've had many friends that have been destitute -- you know , running into trouble -- and places like @entity5 have given them hope and have fed them and gotten them back on the right path			1
it can happen to anybody , and with the economy crashing and what 's going on in the world today , i just thought it was time to try to find a place to go to help people			1
they 're the oldest food bank in @entity6 ... and i like to cook , i like to serve people			1
so we cooked up a bunch of food , and they let us use their truck , helped us serve it , and we raised a lot of money			1
@entity45 : what 's so special about @entity5 ? @entity1 : not only are they feeding people , but they are giving them housing , they are giving them beds , a shower , fresh sheets , fresh clothing			1
they are finding them jobs			0
there is a recovery program for addiction , a program to learn to get back on your feet and to adjust within the community again			0
it 's incredible what they do and how many people walk through their doors , rich and poor , no questions asked			1
they just open these doors and they give these people a fresh start			1
@entity45 : what is a hero to you ? @entity1 : a hero is somebody who is selfless , who is generous in spirit , who just tries to give back as much as possible and help people			1
a hero to me is someone who saves people and who really deeply cares			1
@entity45 : you attended " @entity8 : an all - star tribute " last year			0
what was that like ? @entity1 : being at the @entity8 event last year was almost life - changing			1
i saw the prior year from my living room , and when i got invited i was so excited			0
each person that went up and each little film that was played brought me and my husband to tears because of the generosity of their soul and spirit			0
these people came from nothing , had nothing , and yet did the unimaginable			2
they were n't @entity106 people			2
they were n't rich people			2
they were just people that wanted to help other people			2
it just really made me think , " wow			0
i want to help , too			0
" watching those people made me feel like i was n't doing enough			2
so now i 'm on the bandwagon , and i 'm just trying to help as well because it makes you feel really great and we need it			0
we need a sense of community again			0
@entity45 : did any of those @entity8 particularly inspire you ? @entity1 : there was one young @entity125 man [ @entity8 @entity126 ] who would go into the slums and help bring education to all these children that had nothing and teach them how to read and write			1
it was just beautiful what he did			0
there was @entity136 from @entity137 , [ @entity138 ] , who just had like a regular job , had no money , but he and his family would cook in their little kitchen that was , you know , @entity138 - style -- i 'm talking closet - size -- and half of their house was stocked with restaurant supplies			2
and every night he would cook and bring out food and serve the homeless on the streets of @entity138			2
this guy was just selfless			0
i just thought , " how wonderful			0
" @entity45 : why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes ? @entity1 : there 's so much importance in honoring your everyday hero			1
it does n't take money			2
it does n't take connections			0
what matters is that people get involved			0
whether your passion is gun control or food or whatever it may be , everybody needs to stop being so self - absorbed .			0
