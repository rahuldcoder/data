the @entity15 's solar car races along the road , on its way to the finish line			1
( @entity6 ) -- in the world of higher education , summer is usually the off - season			2
but for some students , this summer was the culmination of years of hard work in a 2,400 - mile solar car race from @entity26 , @entity27 to @entity28 , @entity29			1
fifteen teams of students drove photovoltaic - powered cars across the @entity34 finish line in @entity28 tuesday , led by the @entity35 and its vehicle , @entity37			1
placing second was the car @entity39 from @entity40 , followed by the sole @entity42 finisher , the @entity44 fh @entity43			1
@entity1 's victory , which took about 51 hours and 42 minutes on the road , is its fifth @entity34 championship			1
the school also won the last @entity34 , in 2005			0
it took @entity50 almost ten hours more than @entity1 to complete the race , in about 61 hours and 38 minutes			1
@entity53 's car took about two hours more , but the @entity55 @entity54 was a very close fourth , taking about fifteen minutes longer			1
@entity50 's success may be as noteworthy as @entity1 's margin of victory			1
the college has fewer than 550 students , all of them undergraduates			2
it 's a sharp contrast from the enormous research universities that traditionally win solar car races			1
" it 's unique , i think , for their college to field a team , ( because ) they do n't have an engineering school , " said @entity65 , @entity34 's organizer			1
but he noted that small teams have had some success in the past			2
" if you can get a group of folks who are really committed , then you can do a lot , " he said			0
driving force @entity79 , the race manager for @entity1 , talked about how rewarding it was to enter @entity28 and be greeted by 40,000 people			1
" all the time and dedication really paid off , " he said			0
" we got to get out and walk across the finish line with ( the car )			1
" " the streets were lined with people , " he said			0
" there were people on overpasses with tripods taking pictures			0
" the @entity1 team led almost the entire race from @entity27 , trailing only on the first day of driving when it had to stop to fix a minor electrical problem			1
but that 20 - minute stop was the only time it had to pull over to make repairs , which team members said was one reason they did so well			2
" reliability is one of the key things , " said @entity105 , @entity1 's project manager and a driver			1
" as they get more miles , teams start to get more problems with the car			2
" " once we left @entity117 we just started pulling away from the other teams , " he said , referring to the stop the cars made in @entity117 saturday			2
@entity65 said building a reliable car is " the first criteria " for a successful solar car team			1
" there 's two things that really make a team , " he said , discussing @entity37 's crew			2
" one is they 're very well - organized			0
two is that they 've been able to stay on the road			0
" @entity65 said he was still surprised how far ahead of the rest of the field @entity1 was			2
powering up he noted that @entity1 uses gallium arsenide multi-junction photovoltaic cells on their car			1
the gallium cells can provide almost 50 percent more power than silicon photovoltaic cells , but are nearly twice as expensive			0
@entity50 and a number of other teams also use the gallium cells			0
" we do limit the surface area of the gallium cells , " @entity65 said , but added , " the people who came in first are the people with the high - performance cells			0
" @entity145 , director of fundraising for @entity147 's @entity146 , said he thought the difference between the types of cells teams used had a major impact on the race			1
@entity146 , which placed eighth , uses silicon cells			0
" there 's not anything that i hold against any other teams that did use gallium cells , " he said			2
" but it 's like apples and oranges			0
" @entity162 , operations manager for the @entity163 , disagreed about the advantage provided by the gallium cells			0
her team , which uses the more expensive cells , came in sixth , two spots ahead of @entity146			0
" i really do n't think that would have been a deciding factor , " she said			0
she said the regulation limiting the surface area of the cells negated most of the advantage they provided			0
@entity162 pointed out that @entity28 's team , like @entity146 , had to tow its car when cloud cover was heavy in the early stages of the race			1
she said the reason leading teams did n't have to " trailer " -- which is legal but incurs a time penalty -- was because they were able to get ahead of the weather , not because of any superior technology			0
finishing the race @entity145 and @entity162 both said they were happy with their results			0
@entity162 pointed out that this year was only the second @entity34 her team has competed in , and said sixth is a big step up from their last finish			2
in 2005 @entity28 's team placed 13th			1
@entity194 's finish in the middle of the pack is noteworthy because the team barely managed to qualify for the race			1
its car did n't , in fact , finish the 60 laps on a closed race track in @entity26 , @entity27 necessary to qualify for the race			1
@entity145 said the car had mechanical problems when it first arrived in @entity27 and so the team only got it on the track on the second day of a two - day qualifying process			1
@entity194 only was allowed to compete after finishing the first leg of the trip , to @entity211 , @entity212 , in the allotted time without trailering			0
the teams from @entity215 and @entity216 , which also did n't qualify on the closed track , did n't make it to @entity211 in time			0
" i think we did exceptionally well with what we had , " @entity145 said			0
he noted that when the car had problems , the other teams were eager to help			2
" if there 's a team that 's struggling , " he said , " they 're going to get help from whoever 's available			2
" @entity162 added one caveat			0
" everyone 's sympathetic to each other and wants to see all the other teams cross the finish line , " she said			1
" maybe just not in front of them			0
