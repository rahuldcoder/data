@entity0 -- @entity3 ' chances of winning control of the @entity5 in tuesday 's midterm elections are now up to 95 % , according to @entity1 's @entity7 , an analysis that combines experts ' projections with political watchers ' predictions on key races			1
the jump was driven largely by a @entity16 poll over the weekend that put @entity3 @entity18 7 percentage points ahead of @entity21 @entity20 in a @entity5 race seen as a must - win for @entity24			2
in that race , @entity25 puts @entity18 's chances at 88 %			2
@entity7 also offers bad news for @entity24 sen. @entity29 in @entity30 , whose chances are at just 6 % , and sen. @entity32 in @entity33 , who 's down to 2 %			1
@entity25 's analysis suggests @entity24 are in better shape in @entity36 , where sen. @entity37 has a 69 % chance of holding off @entity3 challenger @entity39 , and in @entity43 , where sen. @entity41 's chances of beating @entity42 are up to 81 %			1
republicans , meanwhile , look to have put @entity46 's @entity5 race out of reach			0
@entity50 leader @entity49 's chances of surviving a challenge from @entity21 @entity52 are up to 97 %			0
@entity3 need a net gain of six seats to capture a majority			0
pick - ups in @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 are all but assured , and @entity24 incumbents are facing uphill battles in @entity62 , @entity33 and @entity63 , as well			0
@entity3 are also hoping for wins in states like @entity30 , @entity66 , @entity43 and @entity36 -- which would help solidify their chances of gaining a majority by providing insulation in case the @entity50 loses seats of its own in @entity73 and @entity74 .			1

after rosy polls , @entity1 's @entity7 puts @entity3 ' chances of winning a @entity5 majority at 95 %
@entity25 gives the @entity50 strong odds of picking off @entity24 seats in @entity66 , @entity30 and @entity33
*democrats* could hold seats in @entity36 and @entity43 , the analysis suggests
