it was january 2014 and i was sitting on the beach in @entity4 looking out at the seemingly endless @entity5 , ebbing and flowing			0
i had just begun a personal project of challenging my lifelong assumption that @entity8 exists			1
you see , i had been a @entity10 pastor for 19 years			1
i resigned from my pastoral position the year before , but now i stepped away from my faith altogether			0
it was a gut - wrenching decision but i could n't see any other way to find peace and clarity			1
i encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical christianity in general , including the way it marginalizes women and @entity23 people			0
i questioned the problem of evils and @entity8 's general silence and inactivity			1
i sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of @entity8			1
now i had to face the very real possibility that @entity8 does not exist			1
would i discover that @entity8 was present and involved , or would i discover that the whole web of theological claims i had embraced and helped develop were false ? i was feeling small against the beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent sea before me			1
then i started to feel grateful			0
" what are the chances that i would be sitting on this beach right now , looking at this remarkable scene of beauty ? " i thought			0
i was struck again by how unlikely my existence is			0
one question i 've been repeatedly asked is how my life has any meaning without @entity8			1
while i had heard dozens of @entity45 apologists claim that meaning can not be found without @entity8 , i had a curious experience			1
my appreciation for life and its potential increased when i stepped away from my faith			1
atheists are often accused of being nihilists or absurdists			0
@entity55 is a school of thought arguing that humanity 's effort to find inherent meaning in life is futile			1
nihilism goes further and in doing so becomes a mood or a disposition as well as a philosophical frame of mind			0
nihilism says that nothing matters at all			0
" if there is no @entity8 , then man and the universe are doomed			1
like prisoners condemned to death , we await our unavoidable execution			0
there is no @entity8 , and there is no immortality			1
and what is the consequence of this ? it means that life itself is absurd			2
it means that the life we have is without ultimate significance , value , or purpose , " writes @entity83 , a @entity45 apologist			2
but my experience is that acknowledging the absence of @entity8 has helped me refocus on the wonderful and unlikely life i do have			1
this realization has increased my appreciation for beauty and given me a sense of immediacy about my life			2
as i come to terms with the fact that this life is the only one i get , i am more motivated than ever to make it count			2
i want to experience as much happiness and pleasure as i can while helping others to attain their happiness			0
i construct meaning in my life from many sources , including love , family , friendships , service , learning and so on			1
popular @entity45 theology , on the other hand , renders this life less meaningful by anchoring all notions of value and purpose to a paradise somewhere in the future , in a place other than where we are right now			2
ironically , my @entity45 upbringing taught me that ultimately this life does n't matter , which tends to make believers apathetic about suffering and think that things will only get worse before @entity8 suddenly solves everything on the last day			1
behold , atheists ' new @entity132 it struck me this year that nihilism is a disease born of theism			0
some people have been taught to expect meaning outside of this world beyond our earthly experiences			2
when they come upon the many absurdities of life and see that it 's " not as advertised , " an existential despair can take hold			2
the problem is not solved by inventing a @entity8 in which to place all our hopes , but rather , to face life honestly and create beauty from the absurd			1
without dependency on a cosmic savior who is coming to rescue us , we are free to recognize that we are the ones we 're waiting for			0
if we do n't make the world a fair and habitable place , no one else is going to do it for us			2
our lives matter because our choices affect others and our children 's future			0
life does not need a divine source in order to be meaningful			2
anyone who has seen a breathtaking sunset or fallen in love with another human being knows that we make meaning from the experiences of our lives ; we construct it the way we construct any social narrative			0
free from false expectations we are free to create purpose , share love , and enjoy the endless beauty of our world			0
we are the fortunate ones			0
there is no need for fear to have the last word .			0

@entity186 , former pastor turned atheist , says we do n't need a divinity to find meaning
