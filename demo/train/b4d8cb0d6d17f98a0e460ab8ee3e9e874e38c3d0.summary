-- @entity2 police still do n't know what set off the incident , what prompted the driver of a gray @entity7 to hit an man and leave him writhing in pain on the pavement of @entity2 gas station			1
in the two weeks since the incident , the motorists has eluded them			2
but they do have one thing : surveillance camera footage			1
and like other enforcement around the country , they think by releasing the video , by posting it online , they 'll get the help they need			1
the start of the video seems mundane			2
cars line up to get gas , people coming and going			0
then , a gray @entity7 pulls into the parking lot of an @entity31 gas station			1
the @entity7 cuts off a man 's car			1
the man , wearing a red cap and sweatshirt , drives around it to avoid an accident			1
later , as the man crosses the parking lot , the @entity7 drives up to him , nearly clipping him			1
then the car moves forward , bumping the man and running him over			1
as the car turns out of the station , the man is seen lying on the ground			1
his cap is knocked off his head			0
" the guy was on the floor for 10 minutes , screaming , " gas station employee @entity46 told @entity0 affiliate @entity47			0
" we tried to help him the most we can			0
" the man was seriously injured and taken to a hospital for treatment , the affiliate said			1
the incident occurred february 6			0
that all happened on february 6th			0
police have some information about the driver , some information about the car and they know it 's has a @entity63 plate			2
they 're hoping if the video gets views , they 'll get their man			2
it 's not a farfetched idea			0
earlier this month , police in @entity72 released a frightening helmet camera video recorded by a motorcyclist weaving in and out of traffic			2
in about a week , they had their suspect in custody			0
and last fall , video of an altercation between motorcyclists and an suv driver in @entity84 resulted in several arrests			0
officer @entity86 in @entity2 thinks the same could happen in his case			0
" it could take just one viewer , " he told @entity47			2
" at no point does anyone deserve to be run over by a car in this way			0

police think releasing surveillance footage will lead to arrest
a gray @entity7 bumps and runs over a man
" it could take just one viewer , " office says
