-- " i was surrounded by cameramen , all on their knees like proposing @entity6 swains , shooting upwards to make my skirt look even shorter			0
i had no idea this was going to happen -- this was publicity that i certainly had not planned			0
on a sultry spring day in 1965 , silence descended on the packed crowd gathered at @entity17 's biggest sporting event			1
all eyes were on @entity19 supermodel @entity12 as she arrived at the prestigious @entity20 -- or more accurately , all attention was focused on the 22 - year - old 's legs			1
" the most beautiful girl in the world " had stepped out at @entity24 wearing a minidress five inches above her knees , with no hat , stockings or gloves			2
in an era when women did n't leave the house without wearing a hat , it was an outfit which both scandalized the nation and sparked a fashion revolution which would define the @entity39			1
as the @entity20 prepares for its 52nd " @entity44 " competition , the iconic image of @entity41 in " that dress " has gained almost mythical status in the history of a horse race now worth $ 6.2 million in prize money			1
known as " the race that stops a nation , " it is one of the richest thoroughbred competitions in the world , and is so revered in its home state of @entity6 that its annual date -- the first tuesday in november -- has been made a public holiday			2
but in 1965 it was @entity41 's legs which famously stopped the country in its tracks			2
" she was one of the world 's first supermodels and her visit was highly anticipated -- everyone was expecting this beautiful hat and accessories , " @entity64 and @entity66 curator @entity65 told @entity0			0
" when @entity12 came marching through the members ' lounge two hours late with her boyfriend of the time -- @entity81 actor @entity80 -- in this casual dress , there was absolute silence			2
" the conservative country was rocked by the seemingly skimpy outfit and , for the first time since the inaugural race in 1861 , the winning horse was knocked off newspaper front pages -- in favor of @entity41 's legs			1
" there she was , the world 's highest - paid model , snubbing the iron - clad conventions at fashionable @entity24 in a dress five inches above the knee , no hat , no gloves , and no stockings ! " screamed @entity91 newspaper @entity92 " @entity12 , " as she was known , had been employed by textile manufacturer @entity101 to be a judge in the annual " @entity44 " dress competition			1
the face of " @entity105 " was flown to other side of the world to promote @entity101 's new fabric , @entity109 , during the four days of the @entity20 -- @entity110 , @entity20 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
@entity12 was sent rolls of the material , designing her secret wardrobe with @entity117 dressmaker @entity116			2
with limited fabric , @entity116 was forced to create the now - famously short dress			0
though @entity12 appeared undeterred by the length , telling @entity122 magazine : " i always wear my day dresses above the knee			1
" @entity101 quickly employed @entity91 milliner @entity125 to create a hat for @entity41 's next appearances			0
the model complied -- for one day			0
by the end of the carnival she had converted back to her trademark stripped - back mod look			0
" it had an enormous impact on the fashion world , " @entity134 said			0
" @entity12 credits the arrival of the miniskirt to her wearing it at @entity110 , though it was probably @entity117 designer @entity141 who invented it the year before			1
" regardless , it was very much the pivotal moment of the introduction of the miniskirt to an international stage			0
" despite the scandal , @entity91 designers copied the fashion icon in droves			0
the following year , newspaper @entity154 reported : " last year 's controversial miss @entity12 would have passed unnoticed in the crowd this year			1
anyone with hemlines below the knee looked very ' old hat			0
' " today , more than 350,000 people attend the @entity20 , with 1,100 men and women taking part in last year 's " @entity44 " event			1
competitors are judged on their originality , accessories , understanding of current fashion trends and deportment , with prizes including a @entity173 convertible			0
" i think to the rest of the world , the @entity20 probably looks like one big party -- and that 's exactly what it is , " said @entity174 , the 2011 fashion competition winner			1
" everyone makes an effort to dress up			0
but it 's done in a very different way to say , @entity185 in @entity186 , for example			0
the lifestyle in @entity17 is quite relaxed -- we do n't have to wear gloves and jackets because it does n't get that cold			1
" by today 's standards , @entity12 's dress was actually quite long			1
" this year , @entity174 is predicting lots of tall hats , rather than traditional large brims			0
" head wear has been getting quite sculptural , almost like a piece of art on the head , " she said			0
since @entity12 first graced @entity24 , international celebrities have become a regular feature of the @entity20 , with high - profile appearances from @entity19 's @entity205 in 1985 , @entity206 in 2006 and fellow @entity208 actress @entity207 last year			1
the @entity20 is as much about its fashion stakes as its horses			2
but when it comes to groundbreaking outfits , no one has ever come close to " @entity12			2

model @entity12 caused outrage by wearing *mindress* to 1965 @entity20
hemline five inches above the knee sparked @entity39 fashion revolution
2012 marked the 50th *anniversary* of the horse race 's " @entity44 " competition
today style is more relaxed at the internationally - renowned @entity17 event
