@entity1 , @entity2 it might be the most bizarre of the closely guarded secrets from last week 's historic agreement between the @entity6 and @entity2 : how did the leader of a @entity2 spy ring serving life in a @entity11 federal prison manage to impregnate his wife 2,245 miles away in @entity1 ? as part of the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between the @entity6 and @entity2 in more than 50 years , a prisoner swap was made			1
to uphold its part of the bargain , the @entity6 released three @entity2 spies , including @entity19 , the head of the spy ring known as the @entity19			1
@entity19 had an ear - to - ear smile wednesday as he arrived at @entity1 's @entity22			1
@entity23 showed @entity19 as he was greeted by president @entity24 and then embraced and kissed his wife , @entity25			1
@entity2 watching the nonstop coverage of the prisoner swap were shocked when the cameras zeroed in on @entity19 hugging @entity29			1
she was obviously in the late stages of a pregnancy that had no easy explanation			0
not only had @entity19 been serving a double life sentence , but his wife also worked for @entity2 's intelligence services and was banned by @entity6 officials from visiting her husband in prison , according to the @entity2 government			1
rumors swirl in sultry @entity1 the subject became the immediate hot topic in @entity1 where rumors swirled fast about the baby 's paternity and whether the @entity2 government could have somehow arranged a clandestine conjugal visit under the nose of @entity6 authorities			1
the couple appeared at another event on saturday , where together with the other freed spies , @entity24 and the communist island 's top political and military officials showered them with applause			0
a beaming @entity19 stood by @entity29 , whose round stomach was clearly visible for viewers of the live broadcast as the couple left the celebration , @entity19 hinted at the secret surrounding the pregnancy			2
" everyone 's asking , and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and speculations			0
the reality is it had to be kept quiet , " @entity19 told the government - run television channel			2
" we ca n't give a lot of details , because we do n't want to hurt people who meant well			0
" he said his wife 's pregnancy was a direct result of the high - level talks			0
" one of the first things accomplished by this process was this , " @entity19 said , gesturing to his @entity29 's stomach			2
" i had to do it by ' remote control , ' but everything turned out well			0
" two sources involved with the diplomatic talks , when questioned by @entity3 , uncloaked the mystery : during the negotiations , @entity19 's sperm was collected and sent to @entity2 , where @entity29 was artificially inseminated			1
the @entity92 confirmed the story , without going into the details			0
" we can confirm the @entity6 facilitated mrs. @entity98 's request to have a baby with her husband , " spokesman @entity95 said			2
what the @entity6 would gain why would the @entity6 government do this ? the artificial insemination was made possible in exchange for better conditions for @entity107 , a @entity6 contractor imprisoned in @entity2			1
@entity107 was released last week as part of the prisoner swap			1
" in light of mr. @entity19 's two life sentences , " @entity111 said , " the request was passed along by @entity115 , who was seeking to improve the conditions for mr. gross while he was imprisoned in @entity2			1
" the discretion on both sides makes sense			0
for 18 months , officials from both countries refused to admit that they were even holding high - level talks			0
officials communicated via back channels , knowing that any leak about the talks could doom the talks			0
@entity29 involved cutting through bureaucratic red tape at multiple @entity6 government agencies			2
as @entity29 began to show , officials from both countries fretted over how they would explain her pregnancy and what to do if the baby arrived before the talks succeeded			0
2001 conviction @entity19 was convicted in 2001 of conspiracy to commit murder for his role in the @entity138 shoot down that left four @entity2 - @entity6 dead after @entity2 air force migs blew up the two civilian planes as they flew toward @entity1 to distribute anti-government leaflets			1
he received two life sentences			0
@entity2 authorities said @entity19 and the other operatives were trying to prevent terrorist attacks from being carried out on their homeland by violent @entity150 exiles			1
that the @entity6 government helped a man convicted of plotting the murder of four @entity2 - @entity6 and spying on the exile community in @entity150 will likely further rankle many of the same @entity155 who were already furious that @entity157 is restoring diplomatic relations with @entity1			1
but @entity159 , an aide to @entity115 who worked to broker the landmark agreement with @entity2 , said helping @entity19 conceive a child led to better treatment for @entity107 by @entity2 authorities and was an important concession to help reach a historic deal			2
" the expectation was that this man would die in prison			0
this was her only chance of having a child , " @entity168 told @entity3			0
@entity19 said he and his wife are expecting their baby daughter to arrive in two weeks and they will name her @entity177			2
@entity178 reported and wrote from @entity1 , @entity2			2
@entity179 reported from @entity157 .			0

@entity19 was the head of the spy ring known as the @entity19
since 2001 , he was being held in a @entity6 prison ; he was released in a prisoner swap
@entity1 has been abuzz since his wife in @entity2 showed up pregnant during news coverage
