-- a few decades ago , i remember grousing to a college friend that as an @entity5 male , everyone i met assumed i was studying some kind of science or engineering -- as if the idea that i might want to pursue a career in the arts , humanities or communications was ridiculous			1
my friend responded that as a 6 - foot - 7 @entity16 pre-med student , he would be ecstatic for someone to actually believe he had an interest in a @entity20 field , as opposed to , say , basketball			1
back then , we laughed off the exchange as a sign of how the stereotype grass is always greener on the other side			2
well , the fact is , stereotypes are n't quite lies ; they 're more like distorted versions of the truth			2
and the diversity statistics that the tech world 's biggest firms have been shamed into releasing this year have been revealing : the numbers show that there are a heckuva lot of @entity37 working in @entity39 's technology industry ... and very few @entity16 and @entity40			1
according to the reports , more than four out of every 10 engineering staff in these tech companies are @entity5			1
that includes 23 % of @entity46 's programmers and engineers , 34 % of @entity48 's and @entity49 's , 41 % of @entity50 's and a staggering 57 % and 60 % of @entity51 's and @entity52 's respectively			0
by contrast -- stark , painful contrast -- around 4 % of employees at these companies altogether is @entity56 and only about 3 % are black			0
in both cases , @entity46 is pulling up the numbers ; without the fruit company 's 7 % @entity56 and 6 % black engineering team , the numbers would plummet			0
to their credit , the tech companies understand this			2
each of them revealed their numbers with sheepish blog posts that asserted the need to " do better " in recruiting black and @entity56 technologists			0
but these same posts have failed to celebrate ( or even address ) what would appear to be a singular diversity highlight : the very large percentages of @entity37 in the engineering workforce			1
maybe that 's because these statistics are n't exactly what they seem			2
the numbers released for @entity5 engineers have lumped @entity39 citizens and permanent residents together with foreign nationals working on temporary @entity86 visas ; over 40 % of h - 1b visa holders are @entity5 ( @entity89 alone accounts for 25 % ) , most of them employed by tech companies			1
take out the @entity86 visa employees , and the eye - popping numbers of @entity5 technologists drops by half			1
there 's also the reality that being an @entity5 technology employee can be a professional dead end			1
a gilded one , to be sure -- the average salary for a computer programmer is around $ 75,000 a year -- but the statistics on leadership - level employees show that most @entity37 in the tech industry hit a ceiling well before they reach management status			1
the percentage of whites , blacks and hispanics who are executives is the same as their percentage in engineering roles			0
@entity37 , meanwhile , are about half as likely to be managers as they are to be coders and hardware hackers			1
" i 'd be lying if i said i did n't notice underrepresentation by @entity37 in @entity129 at the executive level relative to their presence at lower levels , " said @entity120 , a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who began his career at @entity123 and went on to co-found one of the early dot - com sensations , the portrait - rating site @entity127			1
@entity120 points out , however , that it 's not clear whether this is more likely to be evidence of racial bias or a byproduct of immigrant culture			0
" were we on average trained as children to be overachieving bookworms who respect authority and avoid conflict , and do these traits inhibit our progression into the upper levels of management ? " he asks			0
" did strict @entity5 parents restrict their @entity5 children from socializing with their classmates , making them incapable of leading others ? " it 's a question i sometimes wonder about every time i double - clutch before raising my hand to share an opinion , or defer to a supervisor 's decisions even when i disagree			1
( and i 'm about as rash , unruly and outspoken a child of @entity5 immigrants as you 'll probably find , as my parents have concluded			2
) the upbringing that gives you the skills you need to do well professionally does n't necessarily provide you with the mindset you need to excel professionally			0
this suggests that the encouragement of diversity needs to be a priority in a person 's life long before entry into the workforce			2
ensuring that we 're exposed to people of different backgrounds from a very early age does n't just encourage tolerance ; it also provides us with a rich array of cultural models to follow , helping to address the soft spots we face in our individual upbringing			0
it certainly did for me			0
i 'm not sure how i would 've turned out if i 'd lived and grown up in a monocultural environment			0
i imagine i 'd probably be a doctor or engineer -- a mediocre and unhappy one			0
the tech industry is trying to address its workforce shortcomings now , because it realizes that diversity is n't a burden , it 's a secret weapon			1
a diverse enterprise has the wherewithal to buffer collective strengths and bridge individual weaknesses , to zig when others zag and to respond fluidly regardless of shifts in the business environment and consumer landscape			0
and that 's even truer for @entity39 as a whole than it is for the tech industry			1
if the future belongs to the @entity39 , it wo n't be because we invented @entity50 and @entity48			0
it will be because we 're the only nation in the world where @entity5 journalists and black doctors and @entity56 coders live and work side by side .			2

@entity218 : the diversity statistics released from tech industry are embarrassing
@entity218 : while @entity37 do well , there are few @entity16 and @entity223
but being an @entity5 technology employee can be a professional dead end , he says
@entity218 : good news is that tech industry realizes that diversity is a weapon , not a burden
