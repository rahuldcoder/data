summer 1938 , @entity0 stands on the brink of war , and @entity4 is a city on the edge			1
@entity7 spies , shadowy assassins , alluring double agents and a @entity11 movie star caught in the middle stalk the back alleys and bustling bistros of the @entity16 capital			1
this is the setting for @entity19 's " mission to @entity4			1
" the best - selling author has made a career of capturing the classic cloak - and - dagger days leading up to @entity23 , bringing the era to life like a literary version of " @entity27			2
" in @entity28 's 12th and newest novel , now in bookstores , @entity33 immigrant - turned - @entity11 film star @entity31 arrives in @entity4 to shoot a movie			1
the political warfare unit of the @entity7 , the " @entity36 , " has other plans			2
it tries to bully @entity31 into becoming its " agent of influence " in a growing propaganda war against the @entity16			2
@entity31 , a classic leading man in the mold of @entity43 , turns the tables , signing on as amateur spy for the @entity46 and taking a dangerous assignment behind enemy lines			1
from there the action crisscrosses the continent from @entity52 to @entity53 , briefly visiting @entity54 , but the " @entity4 " remains at the center of this espionage adventure			1
starting with " @entity57 " in 1988 , @entity28 has achieved international success as the master of the historical spy novel			1
his 2008 book , " @entity62 , " is being made into a tv miniseries for the @entity64			2
he appears poised for a repeat of his past success with " mission to @entity4			1
" @entity68 recently spoke to the author by phone from his @entity71 , @entity72 , home			0
the following is an edited transcript : @entity68 : what led to your fascination with this @entity79 time period ? @entity19 : in the 1930s there were so many different conflicts going on between the @entity82 , the @entity16 , the @entity83 , the @entity84 , the @entity85 , the @entity86 and so on			1
the intelligence services for all these countries were all battling during what was a very difficult political time			0
i wanted to read a panoramic spy history of the ' 30s , and when i went out looking for it , i discovered there was no such thing			1
so i thought , " well , i 'll write it			0
" where i got the arrogance to do that , i do n't know			0
i could n't believe no one had written about this			0
it seemed so exciting and interesting and various			0
the people who had written about it wrote from such incredibly , violently different angles , whether it was fighting in @entity85 or street demonstrations in @entity16 or the purges in @entity107			0
there was a lot going on , and all of it in its way was important because the politics of the next century was being sorted out			0
i thought i 'd found gold			0
@entity68 : @entity4 really comes to life in your books ; you must have a special affinity for the city			1
@entity28 : when i started writing these novels , i was living in @entity4 in the late 1980s			1
i do have an affinity for the city as it was in the ' 30s			0
it 's changed a lot in recent years			1
i used to have an apartment there			0
i lived there full time for about eight years			0
if you live somewhere that long , you really get to know it by osmosis			0
it really becomes part of you			0
i love @entity4 for the million reasons that everybody loves the city			1
it 's an incredibly romantic and beautiful place			1
i hate to say this , but things have changed in the last three or four years			1
instead of this medieval , sooty , dark , mysterious thing rising into the night sky , now it 's kind of a nice limestone cathedral			1
they 've done a lot of stuff like that in @entity4 now			1
they do n't let you smoke in the cafes anymore -- on and on and on			0
the @entity4 of that time period was an incredible place			1
it was the central city on earth of idealism , of romance , of dreams , of possibilities , of beauty in many ways , of great food , great wine , staying up all night ; what could be bad ? @entity68 : all of your books feature a scene at the @entity169 , a restaurant in @entity4			1
how did you come up with this signature ? @entity28 : it 's in every book			1
the bullet hole in the mirror next to table 14			0
now there is a brasserie where i say the @entity182 is in the books			0
it 's called @entity185 , but it looks nothing like the brasserie i describe in the books			1
many readers have figured out where it is , and they go there and ask for table 14 and make the maître d ' mad because there is no table 14 , there is no mirror and there 's no bullet hole			1
for me it 's a touchstone in my books			1
i love the story , i repeat it every time , but in every book the characters see it differently			0
nobody sees that brasserie the same way			0
they all have their own opinion			0
sometimes it 's important to the plot ; sometimes it 's not			1
it 's like the @entity4 moment when a lot of things come together			1
the way the @entity16 and the @entity220 like to enjoy themselves			0
there 's no music that plays there			2
the music is the plates , the clatter of the forks and knives , the talk , laughter , people smoking , perfume ; it 's a wonderful experience , quite different from eating other places			2
@entity68 : a number of your characters resurface from book to book , but you almost always create a new protagonist			0
why is that ? @entity28 : this is a series with changing lead characters			1
what i discovered is i do n't like to repeat lead characters because one of the most pleasurable things in a book to me is learning about the lead			2
who is he or she ? what do they like ? how are they going to function in this book ? are they brave or cautious ? what 's their romantic situation ? i think that 's a great thing for the reader			2
i decided that what i had to do in order to get different angles on this material you had to have people in different vocations			0
so the lead in " @entity275 " is a cop , and he sees things like a policeman sees things			2
where as in " mission to @entity4 , " you have a @entity11 movie actor , an émigré , and he sees things a completely different way			1
in an earlier book , you had the @entity16 military attaché in @entity288 , and he had his own responsibilities and obligations , and he saw life from that perspective			0
if you 're a writer like i am , it 's the best thing because it forces you to work			2
@entity68 : what do you want your readers to take away from your novels ? @entity28 : these are novels of consolation			1
i am not trying to teach anyone a lesson			0
now , they happen to be about a certain period in the political history of the @entity306			0
if something is resonant to you , that 's fine			2
there 's plenty that 's resonant to me , but i have yet to ever stick my elbow in a reader 's ribs and say , " see that 's just like now			2
" but having said that , there are things that are just like now , and i 've got to tell you that " mission to @entity4 " has an awful lot of just like now			1
the kind of political warfare they had then is a lot like the kind of political warfare going on now			0
there 's a lot of propaganda , a lot of manipulation , a lot of trying to destroy people 's reputations , a lot of lowdown tough stuff			2
i think most @entity46 do n't like it , but it 's the way the game is played , and it has n't changed			2
that 's the way the game was played in the 1930s			1
i have n't changed anything , not one thing to make it sound more like what goes on today			0
i was amazed when i discovered what was going on back then			0
i did n't know that it went on to that level of sophistication			0
@entity68 : you 've described your novels as one very long book with 12 chapters to date			2
how many more books or chapters do you have planned ? @entity28 : let me put it this way , i do n't plan to retire			1
what would i do , become a brain surgeon ? i mean a brain surgeon can retire and write novels , but a novelist ca n't retire and do brain surgery or at least he better not			2
i would n't know what to do with myself			0
i live it and breathe it			0
@entity368 made me this way ; it 's not my fault ! i do n't complain too much			2
really , i feel very privileged to live the way i do and make a living as i have			0
not everybody can do that			0
