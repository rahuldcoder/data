-- we all knew he 'd eventually get around to it : @entity4 is expected to finally bring @entity5 public			1
the company is reported to be preparing to file for an ipo -- initial public offering -- through which anyone will be able to buy shares of the social networking company on an open stock exchange			1
as a media theorist , i used to ignore these business shenanigans			0
who cares if these companies are private or public , profitable or in the red ? how many @entity21 readers even knew what an ipo was back before the @entity23 created the likes of @entity25 , @entity26 , and @entity27 ? but the fact is we do now think about the stock market			2
many of us are aware that @entity33 's market capitalization is fast approaching half a trillion dollars , making it either the largest or second - largest company in the world behind @entity37 - depending on the week			2
so when we hear that @entity5 is preparing for an ipo that will likely dwarf @entity27 's entrance to the public markets in 2004 , particularly considering that the company does n't sell tangible goods or services in the traditional sense , we ca n't help but wonder what this will mean for the future of @entity5 , its users , its competitors , and the greater economy			1
the way it appears at first glance - particularly for those who have been following mr. @entity4 since he launched " the @entity5 " from his college dorm or , better , those who have seen the movie " @entity56 " - is that the @entity4 juggernaut is continuing unabated			1
this new form of media -- social networking -- will not only redefine the @entity23 , change human relationships , create a new marketing landscape , and challenge @entity27 , but it will now rescue and alter the economy itself			0
like virtual kudzu , it will infiltrate the financial markets , creating new sorts of opportunities for this peer - to - peer " social " economy to take root			0
we will all make our living playing @entity74 , or designing new versions of it , or investing in companies that do			0
in reality , however , i do n't think we are witnessing @entity5 's victory over the financial markets as much as its acquiescence to them			1
yes , @entity33 challenged @entity84 for software supremacy , just as @entity5 now challenges @entity27 for internet supremacy			2
but there 's another operating system churning away beneath all this high tech activity , and it 's called corporate capitalism			1
if a company is big enough -- and that means simply holding enough money -- then sooner or later that money influences the rest of the company 's activities			1
in @entity5 's case , it meant approaching the legal limit of 500 investors , which triggers a requirement to open the books to regulatory scrutiny			1
it also meant dealing with a few thousand coveted employees who took jobs at @entity5 instead of @entity27 or @entity33 or anywhere else because they were hoping to get in on a big thing			1
the promise of cashing in a few million dollars worth of stock options helps many a programmer make it through a late night of coding			0
the same goes for those who invested in @entity4 five or more years ago and want to cash in before the " social web " bubble pops , if it 's going to			1
@entity5 was taking so long to get to market that many people had begun selling their shares privately on what are known as secondary markets , putting @entity5 's valuation even further out of the company 's own hands			1
simply becoming a multi-billion - dollar company changes the essence of its goals , activities , and purpose			0
its bloodstream becomes filled with cash , and cash has its own agenda			0
for just like print , tv , or the @entity23 , money is a medium , too			0
it has biases , or tendencies , programmed right into it			0
the kind of money we happen to use -- bank - issued central currency -- is biased toward lending			0
that 's why we call our system " capitalism			2
" it 's about the capital : our money is designed to favor those who lend it to others who actually use it to build companies or create value			0
the more money a company takes in , the more obligated it becomes to function in accordance with the properties and rules of money			0
for example , since becoming public , @entity27 has had to prove its devotion to its shareholders ' interests by cutting pet programs , showing earnings ' growth , and demonstrating focus over big dreams			1
out with public experiments like @entity177 , in with products like @entity180 try to compete with @entity33 's @entity181 and @entity182 + to compete with @entity5			1
no more touting that employees get 20 % of their work hours to do whatever they want			0
it 's a real corporation , now , and has to behave like one			0
by all accounts , @entity4 was trying to delay this eventuality as long as possible			2
he knows that becoming the ceo of a public company will not be nearly as much fun , or as free , as running an internet startup			2
however much we may not like his vision for our future , his primary purpose was to change the world			0
he wanted to create the operating system on which human social activity took place			0
what he has ultimately succumbed to , however , is the fact that @entity5 was running on top of another operating system all along			2
instead of revolutionizing our reality , by filing an ipo @entity4 is finally getting with the program			1
follow @entity209 on @entity210 join the conversation on @entity5 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 says @entity5 's reported plan to go public makes some wonder about future
he says it may seem company *expanding* influence , reaching into , rescuing economy
but really it would be just giving into corporate capitalism , he says : earnings trump big dreams
@entity214 : with @entity207 , @entity4 not so much revolutionizing reality as getting with program
