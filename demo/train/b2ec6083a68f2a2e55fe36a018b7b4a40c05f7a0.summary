-- when i was young , my teachers praised me for being good at math and art , but my father would always tell people , " you know , @entity11 is good at math. " at the time i felt i had to choose between the two -- and with my parents ' influence winning over my own , i went to @entity10			1
after many years there , i learned about computers on many levels			0
in doing so , i saw technology succeeding each year in making everything cheaper , faster , and smaller -- but failing to create any emotional connection or to bring any meaning to our lives			0
design has picked up significant momentum with the success of design - led companies like @entity28 and @entity29 , but the exact meaning of design and how it is applied is often something of a mystery			2
educated as a computer scientist , my bias is to believe in what can be quantified , and so i understand how confusing " getting " design can be			2
qualitatively speaking , however , something designed superbly tends to look and feel better than something designed poorly			1
or , said another way : something designed superbly tends to look and feel " different " than something designed poorly			1
it is whether the difference " works " or not that determines good design versus bad design			1
we encounter design , good and bad , with everything we see , touch , and use			1
it 's invisible to most people because it 's everywhere -- much like the proverbial fish that does n't know where to find water			0
@entity56 : @entity57 on his journey in design one simple way to become aware of graphic design is to try not to ignore the font , or typeface , being used -- which does a lot more than just make a word readable			1
a slight change in line weight can make the word " heavy " seem " heavier			0
" formal appears more formal when set in italics			0
and " far " does appear a bit far ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. away when a little distance gets added into the visual equation			0
design is a way of adding enough visual , tactile , spatial , audio , textural or temporal inflection so as to make the ordinary feel different -- with the goal of making that difference a meaningful one			1
in the early 1990s , my work focused on combining the rigid vocabulary of computer programming with the playful possibilities of art and design			0
i created a series of interactive works in the @entity91 computer language called " reactive graphics			0
" @entity56 : @entity93 on human - centered design my intent was to show that the computer could be more than a cold , clinical object ; it could do things that delighted us			1
though that work is now credited with helping to launch the interactive graphics movement on the @entity102 , at the time it was marginalized by traditional print designers			2
yet i believe that taking principles from one domain and applying them to a new context -- in this case mixing traditional visual aesthetics with advanced computation and algorithms -- is where the practice of design tends to make its biggest marks			2
today , the relevance of design is expanding far beyond visual aesthetics -- to everything from tackling global issues such as climate change , to making sense of the overwhelming amount of data that surrounds us			0
designers have the unique ability to make information , products and experiences both simpler and richer all at once			1
@entity56 : designing objects that tell stories recently i have been thinking that , just as design and technology combined to make the rich creative space that is digital media today , design and technology together will now begin to help leaders navigate their competing priorities , solve complex problems , and nurture fragmented relationships			2
as organizations shift from neatly ordered hierarchies to chaotic , flattened " heterarchies , " where anyone can " friend the ceo , " a new generation of tools will be invented that will allow design and technology to enable leaders to make true connections among people and inspire change			1
just as design enabled us to have an emotional connection with a piece of glass and aluminum that lives in our pocket , design and technology together will restore some of the humanity in what it means to lead in the 21st century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity57 .			2

@entity57 : something designed superbly looks and feels different
much of the time , we tend not to notice good design , he says
designers can make things simpler and richer at same time , @entity57 says
@entity178 : design can *redefine* leadership in age when everyone can friend the ceo
