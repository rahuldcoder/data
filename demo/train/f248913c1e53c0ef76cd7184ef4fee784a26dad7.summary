some of you who follow this space will know i have had a somewhat tortured two weeks reconciling my genetic predisposition to be a @entity2 fan , with my disdain for breaking the rules			1
( some of you probably do n't give a crap what i think , and if that is the case , then i am happy to be wasting your time			1
) i still believe that if the @entity2 had air taken out of the footballs intentionally , then it is cheating			1
repeat : if they did it , they cheated			1
and cheering for them would fill me with guilt and remorse			0
) however , i also believe , that if there is no proof that they did it , then there is simply no justification to penalize them , sanction them , or even criticize them			1
there really needs to be proof that someone took some sort of affirmative action deflate those footballs			1
the existence of an underinflated football is not a violation			0
it is the act of deflating it , or causing it to be deflated that is the infraction ( yes , i once applied to law school )			2
we do n't have proof			1
accordingly , until there is proof , i believe every @entity2 fan should root like hell for them			1
lose your voice , burst your spleen , strain a hamstring ; do whatever you can to get them into the end zone sunday night			0
i will wear my @entity62 jersey with honor and pride			0
and none of these actions or beliefs is inconsistent			0
in fact , i think this is the most reasonable , rational , objective position to take			0
if they cheated , it 's bad			2
right now , there is no proof they cheated			1
i know that there are members of @entity77 who refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that they cheated			2
there are also members of the " snark lobby , " who think too much is being made of all this			0
on the flip side there are @entity2 - haters who think that @entity86 only lies when he speaks or breathes			1
and that @entity62 only achieved anything through subterfuge and favoritism			0
in my opinion , all of these views are wrong			0
and i am only glad you have each other to collectively fester in your pool of myopic loathing ( hyperbole added in the spirit of competition ! )			0
if they cheated , it 's bad			2
right now , while the @entity103 continues its investigation , there is no proof they cheated			1
crush the @entity107 with firm balls all above 12.5 @entity109			2
i am cheering for you 112.5 % percent			0
but after the fact , if it turns out you did cheat in the afc championship game ? well , i will feel angry and guilty and you should be punished			0

@entity118 : until there is proof they cheated , the @entity2 *deserve* fans ' support
the deflated balls do n't prove *wrongdoing* without more *evidence* , he says
