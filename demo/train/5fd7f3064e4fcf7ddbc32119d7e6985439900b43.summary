-- when @entity3 arrived in conflict - ridden @entity4 in 2009 to work as a humanitarian worker , the last thing he expected to encounter was dapper dressing and sartorial splendor			1
" i was blown away by what i saw , " says @entity8 , a former urban planning engineer who went to @entity9 to work for a @entity11 agency supporting internally displaced people ( @entity13 ) in a region rocked by violence for a decade now			1
" as i got more and more exposed to the camps and to the @entity13 , i was taken aback and surprised with what people wore and how different they were from what i was expecting , " says the @entity18 aid worker			2
struck by the eye - catching color combinations and the rich variety of patterns adorning women 's clothing , @entity8 reached for his camera and started taking pictures of @entity4 's local fashion			1
this gave birth to the @entity34 , a project aiming to show to the world a different reality of this remote part in @entity9 , beyond the usual narrative of suffering and violence			1
" the news we usually get about @entity4 -- the war , the oppression , the camps -- exists but that is not the only story , " says @entity8			1
" i hope the project can make people question the reality we see			1
" @entity0 's @entity51 spoke to @entity8 , who is now based in @entity52 , about fashion in @entity4 and his project 's goals			1
@entity0 : how you 'd describe the way these women are dressed in a few words ? pm : colorful -- amidst these deserted landscapes , people dress in incredible colors ; unique -- it 's extremely difficult to find two women with the same clothes ; proud -- there is a pride in the dressing which goes a bit against to what i was expecting to be a conservative way of dressing ; fashionable -- a lot of the clothing is traditionally @entity77 but some is also influenced by the @entity79			1
the traditional @entity77 clothing is the toub -- many meters of cloth that 's wrapped around the body and head			0
because it often falls off , they have to wear something underneath so that the skin does n't get exposed			0
those combinations are often unique ; their undergarment would often be a patterned shirt and trousers , and with the toub , combinations are extremely varied			0
but on top of that , you have all the influence that comes from the @entity77 diaspora , the soap operas and all the films from the @entity79 where women often dress a bit more westernized ; they have dresses , trousers , denim jackets and skirts , so you have a combination of all these things and it 's extremely difficult to find two women dressed the same			0
the variety is something that surprised me ; in the @entity115 we often have these fashionable dark colors and because there are all these franchise stores , you get to see people dressed pretty much in the same way			2
but in @entity9 , they 're so varied			0
read this : @entity124 's designer dandies @entity0 : how easy was it taking pictures ? were there any security concerns ? pm : @entity9 has been in the spotlight for human rights issues for a long time , so they 're extremely suspicious of foreigners going around taking photos			0
but after working side by side for so long with the security services , they eventually ended up trusting me and i was allowed to take pictures			2
@entity0 : did women want to be photographed ? pm : that is quite interesting , because @entity9 is a society where women are expected to behave conservatively and refuse photographs			0
so , when i 'd take their pictures , they would often refuse if they do n't know me			0
but if i 'm taking [ pictures ] of children , then the women would say , " ok , you can take photographs of us too			0
" my colleagues and the @entity13 did n't have a problem because they knew me ; actually , they were quite happy and honored and flattered that a foreigner would be so interested in their clothing			0
read this : @entity157 's fashion bible @entity0 : what has been the feedback you 've received ? pm : most people in the @entity115 are extremely surprised and most people in @entity9 are quite happy that someone is covering @entity9 in such way , with many smiles , and proud , fashionable people			2
but what i 'm mostly interested about is to have people in the @entity115 -- those who know very little about @entity4 , other than the stories of war and kidnapping -- understand that beyond the society we see in the news , it feels perfectly normal and conceivable that alongside war and oppression there are people who live their own lives and have aspirations which are not that different from ours .			1
