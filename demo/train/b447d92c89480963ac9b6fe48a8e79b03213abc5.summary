-- it 's been a summer where you could not escape the matter of race if you tried			1
from the verdict in the shooting death of unarmed teen @entity11 , to lifestyle maven @entity8 being accused of using the " @entity16 " and the @entity13 's overturning a portion of the @entity15 , conversations about race have dominated the headlines			1
at the same time , @entity18 has had the fortuitous timing of releasing two films that appear to reach into @entity22 's psyche right now and wring out all of the unease , anger and pain that can accompany conversations about race			1
" @entity31 " and " @entity32 " contain similar themes about the historical treatment of @entity30 men in the @entity22			1
" @entity31 " is based on the real life case of @entity34 , a 22 - year - old @entity36 resident who was detained by members of the @entity38 and ultimately shot to death on @entity40 2009			1
likewise , " @entity32 " is based on the true story of a black man who served as a butler in the @entity44 through several presidential administrations including during the civil rights era			1
not only do both films tackle issues of civil rights , but they also share a @entity18 connection : @entity51 stars as the main character , @entity52 , in " @entity32 " and is an executive producer of " @entity31			1
" @entity51 spoke to the @entity54 about the two movies ' similarities			2
" we have to recognize , in ' @entity32 , ' in ' @entity58 , ' people ( are ) standing up and trying to say things , " @entity51 said			1
" we 're in a living history			2
... i believe we 're at that moment of a tipping point , where we 're saying , we are in this together and any injustice done to you , as @entity68 would say , is one done to me			1
if i ca n't see my face inside of you , then i truly do n't see the whole of who i am			2
" the success of " @entity32 " -- which was no. 1 at the box office , taking in $ 25 million for its opening weekend -- could be viewed as surprising given outcries over films like 2011 's " the help , " which also featured black characters in roles of servitude			1
@entity83 , who stars as @entity51 's wife in " @entity32 , " acknowledged possible backlash			1
" my mother was a maid			2
my grandmother was a maid			2
her mother was a maid , " @entity83 told @entity88			0
" to look down upon that part of my history would be ridiculous			0
i am the seed of that , " she said			0
" so for me , ( ' the @entity94 ' ) is a story about family and connection , living through those times			0
i hope people come away from it with a sense of pride and gratitude for that generation , because none of us would be here without the butlers and maids			0
" in a @entity0 story titled " is ' @entity111 ' heroic or stereotyping ? " published in 2011 , " @entity111 " star @entity113 -- who also stars in " @entity31 " -- defended the film that eventually won her an @entity115 for best supporting actress			1
" this is one of the first times that i 've seen domestics or people of lower means from that era have a voice and the story has been told from their perspective , " @entity117 said			0
" i 've never read something where we were n't just plot points and our characters had lives outside of the kitchen			0
" prior to the opening of " the @entity94 , " @entity0 asked director @entity135 if he had concerns about black moviegoers not supporting his film			1
@entity135 said he looked very close to home to gauge what the response might be			0
" my family 's rough on me , " he said			2
" i have a 91 - year - old uncle			0
he was the first pediatric surgeon of color in @entity22 and when he saw this movie , i ca n't explain to you what it was like			0
he cried from the beginning to the end , and he laughed from beginning to end			0
" @entity135 believed his 16 - year - old son might have issues with the film , but instead he gave it a thumbs up			0
" he told me that this was the greatest achievement that i had done			0
" scenes from ' the @entity94 ' premiere in a conversation with @entity161 , @entity83 also acknowledged the challenge of getting movie goers to turn out for such heavy fare			2
" i know it 's hard to get audiences of all races and backgrounds out to see a movie , particularly what it takes to just go out to a film ... because race makes people uncomfortable , " @entity83 said			2
" for me ( the film is ) a drama , it 's history and it 's also a great love story about family			2
" since " @entity32 " opened , the film has stirred high emotions for reasons beyond its on - screen themes			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity182 reported that there was concern after a couple took to @entity186 to announce that a showing of " @entity32 " in @entity188 had a large amount of security			1
@entity191 and @entity192 questioned whether the audience was being racially profiled			1
" they must have thought this was going to be a particularly rowdy crowd , " @entity192 told @entity182			0
" i 've traveled the world ; been to a lot of movie theaters			0
this is the first time i 've ever seen anything like this			0
" @entity203 , which owns the theater , issued a statement denying that " @entity32 " had been targeted for any special treatment			1
" @entity203 routinely employs security personnel to ensure the safety of all of our guests and staff , " the statement said			0
" when a theatre experiences sold - out showings of any feature , security will assist with crowd control and guest assistance throughout the facility , including auditoriums			0

like this summer 's " @entity31 , " " @entity32 " *reflects* current conversation
star of " @entity32 " said he believes country " at a tipping point "
a pair of moviegoers claimed their audience was racially profiled
