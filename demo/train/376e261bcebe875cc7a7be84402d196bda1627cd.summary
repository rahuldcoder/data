-- i 'd be lying if i said i did n't wish for a miracle when i was staring down a catastrophic illness almost five years ago			1
though i was being treated by brilliant physicians , my survival odds were still frightening			1
in search of my miracle , i participated in my fair share of odd , nutty and mind - bogglingly irrational activities -- some of which i continue to swear by , but most of which i 'm more than a bit embarrassed to admit			1
i was routinely stuck with needles from head to toe			1
for a period of time i swallowed up to 100 capsules a day			1
i was once alternately frozen , baked and then massaged while half - naked by an elderly @entity22 man who , to my horror , reminded me of my father			1
i hugged trees for energy			1
i also " vibed , " which was basically sitting in a cold basement with a space heater , in front of a starship engine - looking machine with its lights flashing on and off , alongside a few sick people , a couple of depressed people and a cat who apparently was n't feeling well , either			1
like @entity39 i went down the rabbit hole			1
and i did it gladly , happily , and mostly with a good sense of humor -- because ( a ) i was going to leave no stone unturned in my quest to live ; and ( b ) i came to realize that much of what i thought i knew about medicine , food and healing was either wrong or grossly incomplete			1
do i believe in these phenomena , far outside the realms of science -- energy and vibrational medicine , spiritual healing , the mind - body connection -- that may be , as my beloved old editor used to say , " just too woo - woo " ? let 's say i am simultaneously hopeful , but uncertain ; curious , but skeptical			1
in short , i 'm optimistic			2
i am joined in my optimism by almost 40 % of adult @entity60 who , according to the @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity63 , have used a broad range of unconventional therapies , from energy medicine to herbal supplements			1
walking an unusual path to wellness is fraught with doubt , even more so because the resistance often comes from doctors and families , and late - night visits to websites crying " fraud " and " quack " about anything and everything even vaguely outside their strict definition of medicine			1
large , randomized , controlled clinical trials have long been held up as the gold standard in medical research			1
but clinical trials are wildly expensive and notoriously reductionist in their approach			1
not to mention that things that can not be patented -- beets , meditation , exercise and deep breathing , to name a few -- and therefore , produced profitably , are unlikely to be the subject of any such trial			2
( hence the rallying cry , " patients over patents ! " ) just this week , the @entity97 released nutrition and physical activity guidelines for cancer patients , stating that " new scientific evidence has emerged since 2006 on the relationship between nutrition , physical activity , and issues of quality of life , comorbid conditions , cancer recurrence , the development of second primary cancers , and overall survival			2
" recognizing the need for a holistic approach , more and more researchers -- like @entity115 's dr. @entity114 -- are undertaking novel , standardized and integrative studies			1
@entity114 and his colleagues , for example , have designed and are raising funds for a randomized , integrative oncology intervention program for women with stage 3 breast cancer that will include dietary recommendations , physical activity , stress management , social support and control of environmental contaminants			1
many major medical centers have also come around to the importance of an integrative approach to healing by adding complementary specialists and services to their offerings			1
that most of these integrative units remain essentially toothless when it comes to developing treatment protocols is a shame			1
at some point we will recognize that our wonderful and already - overwhelmed doctors ca n't be all things to all people , and we will seek and incorporate the advice of certified nutritionists , naturopaths , energy medicine practitioners and others into regimens for the treatment of disease			1
( and while we 're at it , maybe we can even dream that our health insurance will cover part of it , and that alternative and complementary medicine wo n't just be the privilege of those who can pay for it out of pocket			1
) but even without the hard evidence , people believe			2
the @entity170 's website states : " [ @entity172 ] t is n't always possible to find good studies about alternative medicine practices			1
keep in mind that a lack of evidence does n't necessarily mean a treatment does n't work -- but it does mean it has n't been proved			2
" ultimately , though , the proof is in the pudding			2
like for the young @entity182 state representative who recently told me that his physician wanted to put him on medication for a painful and debilitating colitis he had suffered from for several years			2
" i said , ' how long will i have to be on these drugs ? ' and he told me , for the rest of your life ! for the rest of my life ! " the representative declined and instead began a diet protocol he found through an online support group			2
" i was symptom - free within three days			2
this was about a year ago			2
i called my doctor and said , ' i am mad at you			2
' " or for the @entity202 life and leadership coach who has twice made the pilgrimage to see @entity204 , the @entity205 spiritual healer -- the first time as he struggled in the aftermath of the breakup of a significant relationship and then again to work on deeply held beliefs about achievement , success and happiness			2
he found the stress was beginning to affect him physically			2
" i came away with a greater trust in the divine and the understanding that it 's all one big learning experience , that we all make mistakes and are doing what we can with what we know and have			1
" so much of the stress he was feeling was directly related to his doubts			0
as his anxiety lifted , the physical symptoms began to disappear as well			0
these types of healing certainly challenge our conventional boundaries of medicine , and yet an overwhelming number of people offer testimony to their efficacy			1
dr. @entity238 , a @entity239 professor and science historian , is the author of a fascinating book , " @entity242			0
" the book contains a chapter that tracks several historical instances of extraordinary healing , including in the village of @entity247 in southwestern @entity248 , where in 1858 a young peasant girl named @entity250 claimed that a woman dressed in white ( said to be the @entity252 ) had appeared and asked her to convey important spiritual messages to the community			0
the apparition led the child to a freshwater spring , where locals began to report healings after contact with the water			0
almost 20 years later , the papacy officially recognized @entity247 as a holy place of healing			0
pilgrims continue to flood to the @entity247 grotto and there are still reports of " remarkable healings , " investigated by the @entity269 , which is made up of a panel of physicians			0
a variety of mental and physical cures , including from cases of multiple sclerosis , heart disease , deafness and blindness , sarcomas and paralysis , have been confirmed by the doctors			0
confirmed , but not explained			0
what do you make of these extraordinary healings ? i asked @entity238 recently			0
what i think , she said , is that we do n't know how vast and powerful we are on our own terms			0
" there is enormous mystery and power already in being human ... and the capacity that humans have to transform themselves and to be in relationships that are transformative			0
that i do n't have any doubt about			0
we understand even just that so imperfectly			0
" are we sometimes overly optimistic about these things , almost as if we are attempting to chase down a miracle ? to be sure			0
but optimism is not a bad thing			0
dr. @entity301 , author of the bestselling book , " anticancer : a new way of life , " famously said that while he did not believe in false hope , he also did not believe in false hopelessness			0
@entity301 died from the recurrence of brain cancer last year , nearly 20 years after the discovery of the malignant brain tumor that had been pronounced terminal at diagnosis			0
nor is uncertainty a bad thing			0
it is , after all , the foundation of scientific inquiry			0
science , says neuroscientist @entity318 , is not a collection of facts set in stone			0
it advances by testing its assumptions			0
it begins with questions and observations			0
it begins with being open to possibilities and comfortable with uncertainty			0
here 's the thing about miracles : they only truly belong to the people who experienced them , who witnessed and perceived them with their own senses			1
everyone else either accepts the miracle on faith or as a compelling possibility			0
it would appear as though i got the miracle i had wished for , though i could not begin to tell you how			0
for me it 's a tangle of the intangible , the inexplicable and the mysterious			1
and i 'm perfectly comfortable with that .			0

@entity62 center says 40 % of @entity60 have used some form of alternative medicine
not many randomized , controlled clinical trials are done on these because it 's not profitable
many medical centers have come around to the importance of an integrative approach
