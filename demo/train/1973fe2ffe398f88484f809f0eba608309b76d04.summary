, the floppy - haired hero of @entity4 's winningly nimble and close - to - the - bone family - mishegoss comedy " this is 40 , " is a married father of two in @entity6 who escapes the frazzled swirl of his existence by engaging in deep , dark secret activities			1
he eats chocolate cupcakes — many , many more of them than his wife , @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , a major nutritional scold , would suspect			0
and when he 's feeling beyond overwhelmed , he heads for the bathroom with his tablet to access ... his favorite porn site ? no , to play @entity18			0
it 's a sign of what his life has become that this is his notion of a grand escape , an oasis of me - time			2
if neither of these jokes strikes an amused chord of recognition in you , then you may find " @entity31 " to be mildly funny at best			2
but if they do resonate , you may chuckle , with knowing pleasure , throughout the movie			0
' @entity35 ' wraps filming , tweets a photo the comedies that put @entity4 on the map ( " knocked up , " " the 40 year - @entity40 " ) took off from broadly italicized concepts , but " @entity31 " lets you know in its title that it 's less about a concept than a state of being			1
@entity2 and @entity12 were supporting characters in " @entity48 , " and now they 're turning 40 , with two lovely daughters ( nicely played by @entity4 's own daughters , @entity51 and @entity52 ) and two crusty fathers ( a terrific @entity54 and @entity55 ) , who each have young families of their own			1
the couple still love each other , but their relationship is a mess — a whirlwind of fights , lies , negotiations , teamwork , good sex , bad sex , and general confusion			0
the whole tone of the movie is spontaneous , rolling , experiential			1
it 's got some laugh - out - loud lines , especially when the two jump into the politics of @entity77 's middle school , or when @entity2 is dealing with the business he owns , a struggling boutique music label devoted to the white - guy indie rockers he grew up with and still thinks are cool			1
the joke is no one else does — not even @entity82 ( playing a version of himself ) , @entity2 's latest relic - legend , who knows his records wo n't sell			1
' @entity87 ' looks tough to beat at box office that said , a lot of the best gags in " @entity31 " are the ones that percolate between the lines			0
the comedy is there in how @entity2 leaps like a puppy to do his wife 's bidding , without realizing that he 's already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself ; or in the way that @entity4 never once stages a marital - therapy session — but has @entity2 and @entity12 lapse into the euphemisms of therapy - speak , even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other			1
" @entity31 " is n't always hilarious , but it 's ticklishly honest and droll about all the things being a parent can do to a relationship			2
and why it 's still worth it			0
