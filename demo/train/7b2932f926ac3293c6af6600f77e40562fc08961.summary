there 's romance in our @entity2 , and not just the human kind			1
a self - described hopeless romantic , park ranger @entity5 likes to lead the full moon night hikes at @entity8 in @entity9			1
you 'll have to leave your flashlight behind as you head out at dusk , and @entity13 likes to change her route , so all you 'll know is that the full moon will light the way and it will last about two hours			1
you might encounter animals stirring in the night			0
during february 's full moon hike , @entity13 and her hikers spotted a couple of deer ahead and later , a pair of coyotes			1
that 's part of the magic at @entity28 , which was created as a @entity29 on december 27 , 1974 , and was named a @entity8 on october 11 , 2000			1
@entity8 stats : @entity8 is the 10th most visited @entity8 in the country with 2.3 million visitors last year			0
( @entity33 came in first place with 9.7 million visitors			0
) the park 's boundaries encompass nearly 33,000 acres			1
about 5 % of the park ( or 2,400 acres ) are still privately owned			1
the location : @entity8 is between @entity40 and @entity41 in northeastern @entity9 , along 22 miles of the @entity42			0
if you go : there 's no fee to enter the park , although there are admission fees for some concerts and other programs			1
meet our ranger : @entity5 did n't expect to fall in love with @entity8 when she started as a seasonal ranger there in 1999			1
she had grown up in nearby @entity56 and had only spent a little time there during summer camps and other trips			0
@entity13 was studying elementary education at the @entity61 , and her love of the park caught her by surprise			1
" i decided that by the time i walked the stage at graduation , you need to have decided if you 're going to be a teacher or park ranger , " she said			1
the park chose her : she was offered a spot in the park 's junior ranger program for the summer and was hired permanently in 2000			1
" i 'm still a teacher			0
i just have a different classroom			0
" " there 's nothing better than seeing a little kid looking at their @entity79 book , " she said			1
" i tell them , ' it 's your national park			1
' and then they take ownership			0
" fourteen years later , she credits the serenity and tranquility of the park with keeping her multiple sclerosis in check			1
" my neurologist ca n't believe i 'm still doing this job , " she said			0
" i told him it 's because of this job that i 'm doing this well			1
" for a day trip , do n't miss : @entity98			0
the 65 - foot @entity98 serves as @entity13 ' spiritual retreat in the park			1
" my mother and two ladies from our church rode the train up one sunday , and i took them on a little tour , " she said			0
" i work on sunday , and i told them , ' you do n't need to worry about me			0
' i showed them i can connect right here ( at the falls )			0
it 's very serene and calming			1
all three of them said they got it			0
" @entity98 is an excellent example of the geology of waterfalls : a layer of harder rock capping the waterfall , with layers of softer rock below			1
it 's also wonderful history lesson , as the waterfall was a source of power for a sawmill built in 1814			1
while most of the town surrounding the falls is gone , the house built by the sawmill owner 's son is operated as a bed - and - breakfast			2
if you have a little more time , head to the @entity140 and @entity141 , said @entity13			0
at the @entity144 , perhaps the most popular overlook at the park , you can see the entire @entity8			2
it 's an easy walk from the parking lot or you can enjoy the 2.2 mile loop trail			1
" i love sitting there and looking at the vastness , " she said			0
" it 's open space and very serene			2
" " there is so much activity at @entity141 because the beavers come out , and there are a lot of birds down there , " said @entity13			0
she 's seen a great blue heron landing to catch a fish , snakes and snapping turtles			1
favorite less - traveled spot : @entity167			0
formerly a sand and gravel quarry , a tributary filled it with water and now it 's a great place to fish , said @entity13			2
" it 's a beautiful and serene lake , " she said			2
" it 's not a huge lake , and it 's very tranquil			2
" favorite spot to view wildlife : @entity179			0
@entity13 has spotted great blue herons and heard the frogs during her fall hikes to see the changing colors			1
" you 're hiking in the woods and you come into a clearing at @entity189 , " she said			0
she has also led full moon hikes there , which the park has every month in different locations when the moon is full			1
most magical moment in the park : @entity13 had gone to the @entity196 in 2000 for training , and she says she did n't really appreciate her home park until she got back			2
" i was driving back into work when something clicked and i realized how much i loved this place			0
having been surrounded by the sunburnt colors of the @entity196 , i saw how much i loved the color green			0
i really appreciated this park			2
it was just the right size for me			0
" funniest moment at the park : " when i started working here , a lady asked where she could walk her pet llama , " said @entity13			2
the park has programs with horses , but @entity13 had never worked with llamas			2
she took the question up the park 's chain of the command and discovered that llamas are indeed allowed , with restrictions			1
" a llama is considered a pack animal , and so she could walk her llama on a leash on any of the bridle trails , " on the same trails where horses are allowed			2
a ranger 's request : please do n't feed the animals , she said			1
" we tell people , but they do it anyway			0
it 's not good for them			2
they need to do things on their own and not depend on us			0
" if you see a hurt animal , tell a ranger			2
some animals can bite if scared or provoked			0
another park she 'd like to visit : @entity248 , with its active volcanoes , is the next @entity8 on @entity13 ' bucket list			2
she may be able to get there through a 6 - to - 9 month park ranger swap			1
( check out the park website before you plan a visit , since some sections of the park may be closed because of volcanic activity			0
) " that one looked awesome with the volcanoes going off and hitting the water , " she said			0
" what 's your favorite national park and why ? please tell us in the comments section below .			1
