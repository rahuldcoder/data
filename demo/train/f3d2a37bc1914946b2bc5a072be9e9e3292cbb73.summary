-- it 's often assumed that older people generally are n't very digitally savvy -- but new research from @entity4 indicates that older people are becoming about as skilled online as younger ones			1
according to the @entity14 report from the @entity4 , " the biggest online trend ( we found ) is that , while the very youngest and oldest cohorts may differ , certain key internet uses are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups			2
" the study found that internet users aged 34 and older are more likely than those age 33 and younger to engage in several online activities , including visiting government sites and getting financial information online			1
these online activities are becoming more uniformly popular across all age groups : e-mail , search engines , getting health information , following the news , researching or making purchases ( including travel reservations ) , online banking , supplying reviews or ratings , donating to charity , and downloading podcasts			0

even though younger people are significantly more likely to use social networking services , @entity4 reports that " the fastest growth has come from internet users 74 and older : social network site usage for this oldest cohort has quadrupled since 2008 , from 4 % to 16 %			1
" some online trends are creeping down the age ladder , too			0
according to @entity4 , it used to be mostly older adults who searched for online health information			2
but now this has become " the third most popular online activity for all internet users 18 and older			1
" wireless net access is definitely not the exclusive province of youth			0
like the recent @entity54 mobile workforce study -- which put the median aged of a mobile - enabled worker at 46 -- @entity4 found that 55 % of people aged 46 - 55 access websites or other digital media or services via a laptop , cell phone , or other internet - connected mobile device			1
that figure drops to 46 % for people aged 56 - 64 , and 33 % for people aged 65 - 73			2
the bottom line is , do n't assume you know how digitally savvy someone is based on their age			0
