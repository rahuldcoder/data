@entity0 -- when it comes to the @entity5 , few of us would immediately equate the rich cultural fruits of the period with the birth of the modern banking system			0
but a new exhibition in @entity11 is showing just how intertwined the two really were			1
entitled " money and beauty : bankers , @entity23 and the @entity24 , " the exhibition in @entity11 's @entity15 looks at how @entity11 's famous families got rich -- and how they then used their wealth to commission works from some of the world 's most celebrated artists			1
according to the @entity28 's director general @entity27 , the idea for the show had been in development since 2006 , but it would be another two years before it was cemented as a particularly apt exploration of the city 's history			2
" september 2008 rolls around and we 're talking about the development of the show and @entity37 goes bust , which made the whole idea very timely , " he said			2
the show 's trajectory takes in the birth of the @entity43 and its use of relatively new financial systems , including letters of exchange ( an ingenious type of lending that managed to get around usury laws by changing foreign currencies and profiting on exchange rather than interest rates ) , right up to its collapse at the end of the 15th century			1
included in the show are paintings by @entity23 , who had a close relationship with the @entity58 , as well as paintings of the new mercantile class and their novel activities by artists such as @entity64 painter @entity63			1
and gold -- whether in the form of coins or the golden halos hovering over depictions of the holy family -- is one of the exhibition 's dominant themes and materials			2
the exhibition is curated by @entity77 writer @entity76 , author of " @entity78 : @entity79 in @entity80 , " and @entity81 , an @entity82 art historian and author of " iconography of @entity85 , 1495 -1998			1
" both show how the bankers , worried that their activities might be contravening their religious beliefs , poured money into building churches and commissioning devotional paintings -- often with themselves inserted into them			1
" the bankers were never quite sure whether ( the letter of exchange ) was usury of not , a lot of theologians said it was and a lot of theologians said it was n't , " @entity76 explained			2
" so you have a situation where these bankers , who were often very devout men , were making penitential gestures towards the church just in case , " he said			0
the influence of their new wealth , he said , is evident in the paintings of the holy family , where the @entity110 is frequently depicted wearing sumptuous @entity11 clothes and the artists use significant amounts of gold			1
" you could say that some of these gestures were simply penitential , but then the banker begins to realize that in giving them money he can also begin to define the image that is produced by his money , and of course one of the things he instinctively does , whether it 's conscious or not , is to use the image to change the attitude to money , that is , begin to use the image to undermine the resistance to money , " said @entity76			0
money was feared , he said , not only because @entity133 espoused poverty but crucially because it allowed for social mobility and therefore undermine the set @entity137 hierarchies			0
still , for a few years , the @entity58 were in charge of papal finances			0
and , said @entity76 , the artists were often happy to oblige in order to ensure their own economic prosperity			0
@entity81 , for her part , does n't believe that the artworks commissioned necessarily spoke of cynicism on the part of the patrons or the artists			0
" patrons wanted works of art to highlight their wealth and their power , but the beauty aspect allowed them to " purify " their money , to shake off the vulgarity and the sense of sin that has always been associated with it , " she said			1
regardless of their efforts , there was a backlash , personified at the end of the 15th century by the preacher @entity85 , who railed against the lavish lives of the rich and encouraged artists such as @entity23 to throw their works onto " bonfires of the vanities			2
" the exhibition ends with a section on @entity85 and includes the turbulent , later paintings of @entity23 , who @entity81 believes was tormented by " emotional anguish			1
" it was a tumultuous time , said @entity27 , with some echoes of our current predicament			0
" it is not a coincidence , any more then than now , that wealth and the investment in certain kinds of expression of wealth are related , " he said			0
" one might say ( the banker 's money ) basically funded the @entity5 , " @entity81 concluded			0
money and beauty : bankers , @entity23 and the @entity24 runs at the @entity15 in @entity11 , @entity82 , until january 22 , 2012 .			1
