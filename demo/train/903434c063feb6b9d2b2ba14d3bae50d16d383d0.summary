@entity0 makes his way along @entity3 's secured streets , struggling to put on his tie and manage his monogrammed backpack at the same time			1
the 27 - year - old is on a mission : he 's looking for a party			1
he works with the @entity10 , a nonpartisan , nonprofit group that advocates for greater government transparency			1
his goal at the @entity13 , as it was at the @entity15 ' confab in @entity16 : to crash as many parties as he can , then blog about them			1
since 2008 , his organization 's @entity19 website has been tracking exclusive , behind - the - scenes events where politicians and special interests meet , often out of the spotlight			1
the groups hosting these events , @entity25 says , hope to influence the outcome of the november elections -- as well as lawmakers ' votes in @entity32 and state capitols			1
by his count , there were at least 400 parties planned during the @entity13 and 200 during the @entity38			1
" all the big players are at the conventions at once , " he says , " so it is sort of like being in the @entity44 party circuit on steroids			2
" tonight @entity25 decides to stop by @entity47 's " @entity46 " party first			1
the organization has been under recent attack from republicans in @entity32 who have repeatedly tried to shut off federal funding for the organization 's family planning efforts			1
the @entity56 , the group 's political arm and official host of the party , has spent nearly $ 2 million during this year 's election cycle -- most of it on negative ads against @entity15 , according to the @entity63			1
while groups like @entity56 spend millions to elect @entity68 , groups like @entity66 work to put @entity15 in power			2
@entity25 has an issue with the laws that regulate these types of groups , because they 're not required to reveal the names of the donors who ultimately pay for those ads. " there is a real transparency issue here , " @entity25 says			1
@entity25 says he tried but failed to get into the @entity66 party in @entity16			2
here in @entity3 he does n't have a ticket , but he sees a friend outside the @entity47 party who helps			2
he says he can usually talk his way into events			1
at his friend 's urging , security waves @entity25 and his @entity10 colleague @entity89 through			1
they even let them use the velvet - lined vip line to bypass the crowd			2
inside , smartly dressed older women sit in a line on comfortable couches , checking their email on smartphones			2
a man wearing an @entity104 ball cap orders a drink called " @entity106 " for his girlfriend			0
he 's having the " @entity108			1
" a woman clutching one of the " we love @entity113 " banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances " @entity116			0
" the giveaways here are simple and , in some cases , intended to provoke a laugh			0
condoms inside hot pink matchbook covers lay on low tables around the dance floor			0
the front of the package says " @entity127 in this election			0
" it 's an advertisement for @entity47 's women are watching website			1
" this party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base , " @entity25 says , as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows			0
" it 's not a party where you will rub shoulders with governors , and people are n't necessarily sowing the seeds for laws that will be written next year here like we 've seen at some of the super-elite parties , but it still is important , " @entity25 says			1
he pulls out a small @entity155 pad and takes notes as he talks to someone by the bar			0
the loud disco music suddenly fades away , and the emcee tells the excited crowd that two special guests have arrived			1
the floor goes wild as actress @entity164 stands in front of a hot pink " @entity46 " banner with @entity168 minority leader @entity167 at her side			0
" the @entity68 have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them , and @entity167 is a rock star among the @entity13 base , " @entity25 says			1
" @entity174 " during the conventions @entity167 talks about the @entity68 ' support for women 's issues -- among the convention themes earlier that evening -- then encourages the crowd to support the president			1
after @entity167 wraps up her speech , she does a little dance as the ' 70s hit " celebration " plays her loudly off the stage			0
she poses for photos with @entity47 leaders and other vips			0
people start to dance again			0
@entity190 , a political science professor at @entity191 who was in @entity3 to observe the convention , says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues			1
they are also mutually beneficial to the people who attend			0
" some will show up to these parties for nice swag or good food or to show their support for a particular political message , sure , " @entity190 said			1
" but it 's also aimed at the fledging county commission candidate who shows up at the convention			1
" the fact that @entity167 is there gives them a chance to take a picture with her and then tweet it out or put it on their @entity213 page			0
it gives them a certain type of credibility			0
it makes them look important , and they 'll remember an organization that made this happen			0
" @entity25 says there were several splashy events at the @entity38			1
though fewer in number than at the @entity13 , the parties were equally high profile			1
at the @entity234 , scantily clad women dressed as mermaids floated in a tank as guests at the @entity233 party ordered drinks from multiple bars			0
in " a salute to the @entity168 and @entity239 , " attendees could shag balls and take batting practice at @entity242 for a charitable donation			0
a $ 15,000 donation got people into a private reception with former @entity234 gov. @entity247 , courtesy of the foundation for @entity234 's @entity250			1
it 's midnight back in @entity3 before @entity25 and @entity252 head out past streams of other party - hoppers and make their way to a swank hotel near the convention center			1
the lobby has a different feel than the @entity47 party			0
well - dressed guests sit at a tiny table by the bar with a couple bottles of expensive @entity266 champagne			0
sen. @entity267 stands in the corner having a hushed but animated conversation with two equally tall men			0
and more people carrying " we love @entity113 " signs , now somewhat crushed , make their way toward the elevator			0
on the hotel 's second floor is " come together : a @entity278 " honoring the @entity279			1
@entity25 does n't have an invitation here either , but he blends into the crowd to make his way into the fancy ballroom			0
the event invitations advertise the party 's sponsors			1
@entity25 says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor			0
@entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297 were among the hosts			0
@entity190 says some people may be uncomfortable with the role corporations play behind the scenes at such events , but she thinks they are necessary			1
" taking corporate funding for them is a double - edged sword since you do need someone to pay for it , " she says			0
" you do n't want to use public funds for a party			0
" that type of corporate sponsorship may suggest they have more influence than others with politicians , and some may take issue with it , but groups do n't have the money to do this on their own and they want to attract the right people to their events			1
" people wo n't show up if the party is boring			0
" men with lapel pins identifying them as state legislators or congressmen make their way into the party			0
@entity252 points out others wearing special pins she says are given to big @entity104 donors			1
@entity25 ignores the live band playing @entity338 's " @entity337 " and forgoes the red , white and blue macaroons			1
instead , he talks to people and takes notes			0
" this is more a top - flight party than @entity47 's , as the guest list is more exclusive and the food , drink and space itself is some of the most expensive i 've seen , " @entity25 explains later			2
he speaks with a county commissioner running for @entity32 and her husband , a lawyer at @entity349 -- another of the evening 's sponsors			2
the party , he says , " is about building relationships with people in business and the government			2
" @entity356 is a political ethics expert whose nonpartisan nonprofit , @entity358 , has teamed up with @entity25 's organization in the party monitoring enterprise at the convention			1
he worries these parties play an outsized role at conventions			2
" these conventions are supposed to be merely ... events to rally for these candidates , " @entity356 says			2
" but the lobbyists and special interest groups are indulging in a real habit of turning these conventions instead into lobby - fests			2
" @entity190 has a different perspective			0
" the conventions are really professional conferences , " she said , " and like most trade associations , networking is a big part of what you are doing here			0
" " yes , the delegates are here to nominate their candidate , but behind the scenes you have a lot of local candidates trying to make connections , meet potential fundraisers and backers			2
that may be more important to them than the activities you see on tv			0
it 's hard to develop a profile for yourself and a reputation if you do n't know anyone			2
" it 's past 1 a.m. when @entity25 leaves the party and heads off to another			2
he hears the actor and hip - hop artist @entity403 is performing at a party within driving distance			0
he 'd prefer not to stay out too late if possible ; he 's learned that a certain @entity406 is hosting a brunch at an undisclosed location in the morning			2
it 's supposed to be at a mansion , but he does n't know which one			2
puppet protesters pull no punches			0

nonpartisan nonprofit tracks events where politicians , special interests meet
group advocates for greater government transparency
