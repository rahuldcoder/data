@entity0 , @entity1 -- i first met @entity4 in 2003 , when he stepped into the cockpit of the @entity7 / @entity6 at @entity8 , just before the third race of the season at the @entity12 racing track in eastern @entity13			1
he was a cocky , fastidious 23 - year - old in those days , with a quick step and a winning way that made him seem like a modern - day @entity19 character brought to life			0
" @entity21 , " i called him back then			0
we began our @entity25 careers together			0
i was hired by the company around the same time @entity4 was hired as test driver for development of the @entity25 engine that would make its @entity31 debut during that season			1
in short order , he became one of @entity25 's favorite sons			2
in 2004 , he became the first @entity25 - powered driver ever to win an @entity31 event at the magnificent @entity12 complex			2
the @entity25 - owned course had not seen one of its own cars take the checkered flag at its signature event in six futile attempts			0
he won @entity45 again in 2005 and then went on to win that year 's @entity46 and the @entity48 championship , a feat that has not since been matched			2
there were numerous highlights after that : 16 @entity31 victories in all , culminating in this year 's completely implausible win in the @entity55			2
services held for @entity4 in @entity1 that 's what the record book says			1
it documents @entity4 's legacy in numbers			1
but it does n't come close to capturing his legacy in the hearts of those who knew him			0
the @entity67 knew was more than a racer			0
he loved the food my trackside chef , @entity75 , prepared at virtually every @entity48 event			0
( that hardly made him unique -- @entity75 is a really good chef			2
) what set @entity4 apart was his genuine interest in all the members of the hospitality staff			1
he treated them all as his equals , and as a consequence , they were all left equally shattered after the tragedy			1
around the track , just about everyone had their own " @entity4 moment			1
" he had an uncanny talent to connect quickly and personally with everyone he met -- whether high - dollar sponsor or @entity95 bleacher - ite -- and to give each of them something far more valuable than an autograph or a photo			1
he left them with his kindness , his spirit			2
he never turned down a single request , whether it was for an appearance at a dealer meeting , a ride - and - drive with the media or a quick " @entity111 " to a group of trackside guests			0
in each case , he brought a smile that was manufactured only in the most literal sense -- his realigned teeth after his ' 05 championship were an ongoing source of paddock amusement -- but genuine in every other imaginable way			1
in a world where part of the competitive ethos is to convey at all costs an impression of invulnerability , @entity4 was the exception			1
as a colleague said to me the other day , " he let you in			0
" my @entity4 moment occurred after the @entity55 this past may			1
after winning the prestigious race for the second time , @entity4 had just concluded an exuberant celebratory victory lap at the @entity133			1
he returned to @entity134 to begin the @entity135 -- that incessant procession of ballcaps and photo ops , which , for understandable reasons , lasts about five times as long at @entity133 as at any other track on the @entity48 circuit			1
@entity4 had just stepped into the cockpit , and had the first hat in hand , when he looked to his left and saw me standing along the railing that divided the race car from the rabble			1
he placed the hat on the car 's nose , got out , walked around to my side of the car and grabbed me			2
i barely remember what he said to me , but i do remember hearing a loud cheer from the grandstand above us in @entity134			0
and i remember thinking , " that 's pretty cool			2
some people i know are happy that i 'm getting this moment			0
" it was n't until we separated , and @entity4 resumed the headwear ritual , that i looked above me to see that i did not recognize a single face among those who had been doing the cheering			1
whether or not it is true , i 'm going to continue in the belief that those spectators were paying tribute to the emotion of a moment between the @entity46 winner and some guy none of them had ever met			0
and that blew me away			0
just before he returned to his car , @entity177 and i spent time crying in each other 's arms			0
we were crying tears of joy , feeling all the pain and all the hard work it took to get to that moment , and celebrating all the promise the future would hold for him			0
after last sunday afternoon , i am not ashamed to admit , i have cried in many other arms , as well .			0

@entity190 : @entity4 was more than a *superb* driver -- he was a hero
@entity190 says @entity4 treated all hospitality staff members as his equals ; his death was tragic
he wore a genuine smile and shared his spirit with all who *wanted* a part of it , @entity190 says
@entity190 calls @entity4 's spirit " something far more valuable than an autograph or a photo "
