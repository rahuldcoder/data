the phone of the first officer of @entity4 was on and made contact with a cell tower in @entity7 about the time the plane disappeared from radar , a @entity1 official told @entity10 on monday			1
however , the @entity1 official -- who cited information shared by @entity7 investigators -- said there was no evidence the first officer , @entity4 , had tried to make a call			0
the official told @entity10 's @entity18 on monday that a cell - phone tower in @entity20 , @entity7 -- about 250 miles from where the flight 's transponder last sent a signal -- detected the first officer 's phone searching for service roughly 30 minutes after authorities believe the plane made a sharp turn westward			1
the details do appear to reaffirm suggestions based on radar and satellite data that the plane was off course and was probably flying low enough to obtain a signal from a cell tower , the @entity1 official said			1
the revelation follows reporting over the weekend in a @entity7 newspaper that the first officer had tried to make a telephone call while the plane was in flight			0
asked sunday by @entity10 about the newspaper report about a purported effort to make a call by the first officer , @entity7 's acting transport minister @entity43 said , " as far as i know , no , but as i said that would be in the realm of the police and the other international ( authorities ) and when the time comes that will be revealed			1
but i do not want to speculate on that at the moment			0
" @entity1 officials familiar with the investigation told @entity10 they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the @entity20 tower			1
pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate			2
" it would be very rare in my opinion to have someone with a cell phone on in the cockpit , " safety analyst @entity63 said			1
" it 's never supposed to be on at all			0
it 's part of every check list of every airline i am familiar with			0
" when the plane first went missing , authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched , looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off , but the search turned up nothing			1
underwater search is shortened efforts to find the missing plane and the 239 people aboard were focused beneath the choppy surface of the southern @entity88 on monday as @entity90 authorities sent a @entity92 - contracted submersible diving toward the sea floor			1
but after completing just six hours of searching for underwater debris , the autonomous underwater vehicle @entity95 returned to the surface , according to the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity90			1
it should have taken the probe and its operators 24 hours to map the first portion of the search area : 16 hours to map , four hours ' travel time to just above the ocean floor and back , and four hours for analysts to examine the data gathered			1
it is unclear how much of the area -- 5 kilometers by 8 kilometers ( 3.1 miles by 4.9 miles ) -- the @entity95 scanned			2
it could take up to two months to scan the entire search area			0
officials said a built - in safety feature recalled the underwater search vehicle after it exceeded its operating depth of 4,500 meters ( 14,763 feet )			1
capt. @entity117 , who heads the @entity1 presence in the search effort , said the @entity95 aborted so the crew could refine the mission parameters			0
charts indicated the ocean was at most 4,400 meters ( 14,436 feet ) deep , so when the @entity95 went deeper than that , it was returned to the surface			0
" it happened in the very far corner of the area it 's searching , so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search , " he told @entity10 's " @entity135			1
" the decision to put the @entity95 - 21 into the water for the first time in the 38 - day search comes nearly a week after listening devices last heard sounds that could be from locator beacons attached to the plane 's " black boxes			1
" " we have n't had a single detection in six days , " @entity90 chief search coordinator @entity145 said			0
" it 's time to go underwater			1
" the probe is equipped with side - scan sonar -- acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound			0
such technology is routinely used to find sunken ships and was crucial in finding @entity157 , which crashed into the @entity158 in 2009			0
@entity145 cautioned against hopes that the underwater vehicle will find wreckage of the plane , which disappeared on march 8 on a flight between @entity164 , @entity7 , and @entity165 that should have taken about six hours			1
" it may not , " he said			0
" this will be a slow and painstaking process			0
" the bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it 's more flat and almost rolling , @entity145 said			2
but he said the area probably has a lot of silt , which can " complicate " the search			0
the search area for the @entity95 is in what officials labeled the most likely area the plane could be			2
" it was the site of the highest signal strength or the loudest received signal , " @entity117 told @entity10 , referring to the pings detected by a towed pinger locator , a wing - shaped listening device connected to the ship by a cable			1
" it was also where we had an increase in signal strength as we drove through the area and then a decrease as we drove out of the area			0
" new clue on the surface of the water ? another possible clue into the plane 's disappearance emerged monday			1
@entity90 officials announced the @entity90 ship @entity201 had detected an oil slick sunday evening			1
it is unclear where the oil came from			0
a 2 - liter sample has been collected for examination , but it will take a few days to analyze			0
" i stress the source of the oil has yet to be determined , but the oil slick is approximately 5,500 meters ( 3.4 miles ) downwind ... from the vicinity of the detections of the @entity213 on @entity201 , " @entity145 said			1
@entity10 aviation analyst @entity214 , who flies a @entity215 , said the engines on the plane have about 20 quarts of oil each			1
" it could be slowly dripping up to the surface , " he told @entity10 's " @entity221 360			1
" " they 're saying an oil slick			1
i 'm wondering if it 's just some sort of a fluid slick			2
it could be ( from ) hydraulics			0
" if it is oil , it 's not the first oil slick detected as part of the search			1
a similar find in the first days of the search was determined to be fuel oil from a freighter			2
surface search nearing end twelve aircraft and 15 ships participated in monday 's search efforts on the surface , covering an 18,400 - square - mile ( 47,600 - square - kilometer ) area			2
the surface search was among the last , @entity145 said			2
" the air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water , " @entity145 said			2
that search was energized last week when searchers using the @entity92 - owned pinger locator and sonobuoys detected sounds that could have been from the plane 's black boxes , or data and voice recorders			1
but after a week of silence , the batteries powering the locator beacons are probably dead , a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told @entity10 on sunday			2
they were certified to last 30 days , a deadline that 's already passed			0
that means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane			0
" more than likely they are reaching end of life or already have			0
if ( a beacon ) is still going , it is very , very quiet at this point , " @entity275 told @entity10 's " @entity279 " on sunday			2
the time is ripe to move on to other search techniques			0
" every good effort has been expended , but it 's now looking like the batteries are failing , and it 's time to start mowing the lawn , as we say , time to start scanning the sea floor , " said @entity282 , a @entity10 analyst and ocean search specialist			1
@entity290 , the mother of the missing plane 's chief steward @entity291 , said the news that no more pings have been heard is upsetting			2
" our sadness is now just prolonged , " she told @entity10			0
" i feel like they are somewhere , " she said of the passengers			0
" i do n't know where			0
" how do underwater sonar subs work ? what happens after the pingers die ? listening for pings , water plays tricks			0

@entity10 aviation analyst says surface slick could be fluid *leaking* from underwater plane
cell phone tower detected *co-pilot* 's phone around time of disappearance , official says
an oil slick has been found *5.5* kilometers ( 3.4 miles ) from where pings were detected
underwater search vehicle comes back to surface early after exceeding depth limit
