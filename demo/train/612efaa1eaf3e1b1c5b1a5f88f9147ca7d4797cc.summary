editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			1
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- @entity25 , as his birth certificate calls him , is sort of like a laser @entity27 , and his cluttered @entity8 studio - laboratory ( replete with devoted interns ) feels something like a time machine , a living ode to a seemingly obsolete art. but listen to him tell his story , take a look around his space , and you might agree that there 's no more accurate way of representing the world than with holography			1
the walls bear witness to his cachet at the height of the holographic era : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 have all sat for @entity55			1
his laser lighting has been used at the original @entity57 , on @entity58 , in print advertising for @entity60 and @entity61 , on @entity62 , for book and magazine covers , and a number of music videos , including a starring role in one by " @entity68 " which landed him the first on - air credit in a video on @entity72			1
in 2001 , the producers of @entity74 asked him to help them design a saxophone - playing hologram ( @entity76 assured : it had nothing to do with this			0
) watch the rest of doctor laser at @entity9 while colorful , moving holograms that float in midair remain the stuff of science - fiction , @entity55 has pieced together a reality that 's much stranger : his studio in @entity88 , tucked into a former blacksmith 's forge , is a veritable wonder cabinet of dancing @entity93 imagery , flashing lasers and homemade holography equipment			1
" to be able to take the ordinary , and work with whatever 's at hand , and turn it into a technological miracle " is what @entity55 says excites him most			2
" ' you could have picked this up at @entity103			0
why are you building it yourself , doctor ? ' he says , imitating one of his gaggle of mad , devoted interns			1
" however , being one of the last people at the party is always tough , and in spite of current @entity93 obsessions , getting the world to come back to the party seems even tougher			0
but he 's not giving up			2
besides providing lasers for wild parties , music videos , school trips and being commissioned by a former candidate for the presidency of @entity125 to produce eight original pieces , he 's determined to see that president @entity127 becomes the first sitting president to pose for a hologram			2
" @entity130 is n't always a bad thing , " he says			0
neither is illusion -- especially when it 's made with homemade lenses and lasers .			0

@entity25 , aka doctor laser , has devoted his life to holograms
@entity140 has created holographic *portraits* of @entity48 , @entity51 , @entity54
his laser lighting has been used in print ads for @entity60 's and a " @entity68 " music video
