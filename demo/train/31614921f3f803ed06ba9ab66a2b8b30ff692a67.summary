-- when @entity2 trailed @entity3 2 - 0 on the road in @entity5 on sunday , things looked bleak for the defending champion			1
it was still without talisman @entity8 and there was no @entity10 , either , because the @entity11 was suspended			1
midfield playmaker @entity12 was the latest player to join the injury list			0
but @entity2 still had @entity14 , and the @entity16 international forward netted a first half hat - trick to inspire a comeback 5 - 2 victory			1
@entity20 accounted for @entity2 's two other goals			2
as a result @entity2 returned to first place on goal difference ahead of @entity25 heading into the @entity27 break			1
@entity25 had rallied itself on saturday , beating @entity28 3 - 2			1
" we maintained our form despite being down two goals and we ended up playing a really good game , " @entity2 manager @entity29 was quoted as saying by the club website			2
@entity36 and @entity37 gave @entity25 - based @entity3 the perfect start , scoring in the 10th and 14th minutes , respectively			1
not long after , however , @entity14 took over with his nine - minute treble			2
@entity20 set up his chip in the 34th minute , @entity14 curled a shot into the top corner in the 41st and two minutes later he pounced from close range			0
@entity14 has scored in his last four starts and boosted his league tally to 10 to pass @entity8 for the team lead			1
" he has a great capacity to score , " said @entity29			0
" not only with @entity2 but with @entity48 as well			1
it does n't matter if he 's a starter or if he comes into the match as a sub , he does n't give up			0
" @entity3 -- which won four straight games in september and october but was thumped 7 - 0 by @entity25 last month -- almost equalized early in the second half through @entity54			1
that was its last real opportunity			0
@entity14 assisted on @entity20 ' effort in the 68th minute and was subsequently fouled in the box			0
@entity20 made no mistake from the spot in the 72nd minute			0
@entity61 later downed @entity62 3 - 2 away to once again pull within five points of the leaders			2
some would say @entity25 was fortunate , since @entity66 's goal in the 40th minute might have been offside and @entity68 's winner in the 82nd came when @entity70 was beaten at the near post			0
a calf injury sidelined blockbuster summer signing @entity74 but his replacement , @entity76 , opened the scoring for @entity25			0
easy for @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity78 has responded in the best possible fashion in @entity81 after being knocked out of the @entity82			1
it thumped @entity84 4 - 0 thanks to a @entity87 hat - trick and the striker scored again in sunday 's 4 - 1 win at @entity90			1
@entity90 did have some reason to celebrate -- @entity93 's goal in the 15th minute was the first the @entity78 conceded in the league in nine matches			0
@entity96 kept pace , staying five points behind the defending champion , with a 4 - 0 win over last - place @entity101			1
although still unbeaten in @entity81 , @entity96 had drawn five of its six previous encounters			2
in the @entity108 derby , a backheel four minutes from time from @entity106 saw @entity109 prevail over @entity108 1 - 0			2
@entity109 rose to fifth but is 15 points behind @entity78 , while @entity108 is only five points above the relegation zone			0
to add to @entity108 's misery , @entity112 received a red card in injury time .			0

@entity2 beats @entity3 5 - 2 to replace @entity25 atop @entity48 's @entity5
@entity3 took a 2 - 0 lead at home but a @entity14 hat - trick gave @entity2 a *halftime* *advantage*
@entity2 won despite missing the likes of @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity12
@entity78 maintained its five - point lead over @entity96 in @entity79 's @entity81
