@entity0 -- you 've probably read those articles about how , in the @entity5 , minorities are becoming the majority			1
that 's a polite way of describing what is really going on			0
namely , that the @entity5 population is becoming more latino and less white			1
more than any other group , it is @entity12 who are driving demographic changes			0
last week , the @entity14 reported that , of all the babies born in the @entity5 in 2011 , more than half were members of minority groups			1
latinos , @entity19 , african - americans and other minorities accounted for 50.4 % of births last year , marking the first time in @entity5 history this has happened			1
immigration is a driving force			0
so is the fact that @entity12 have higher birthrates because they tend to be younger and starting families			0
according to the report , @entity12 have a median age of 27 ; with whites , it 's 42			0
when i read these kinds of stories , i wince			0
some people assume that making lawmakers , media and corporations aware of population trends will persuade them to see the value in diversity and cause them to reach out to nonwhite populations			2
in my experience , it does n't have that effect at all			0
people tend to do what they want to do the way they 've always done it			2
but what you can set your watch by is the backlash to these stories			0
it 's rooted in fear , but also in human nature			0
no one likes being told they 're being displaced or pushed aside , or that they 're not going to be as relevant as time goes on			2
so when @entity65 , a senior research associate at the @entity66 , tells @entity1 as he did recently : " the @entity68 ' problem is that their voters are white , aging and dying off " and that " there will come a time when ( @entity68 ) suffer catastrophic losses with the realization of the population changes , " it is bound to set off shock waves			0
conservative radio talk show host @entity77 saw the @entity1 story as a threat , and he went ballistic			1
" it is clear that this , and other similar stories like this , are meant to serve as a warning to @entity68 and conservatives , " @entity77 told his audience of millions			1
" and the warning is : you are on the wrong side of history			0
and you are on the wrong side of demographics			0
you better do what the coming majority wants right now , or you 're gon na suffer the consequences			1
there is an implied threat in this story			2
you 're white and you 're dying off			2
pretty soon you 're gon na find out what it 's been like to not be you			2
" " that 's the implication of the story , " @entity77 insisted			1
" you 've been the majority for all these decades , all these generations , but your time is coming when you 're gon na be the minorities and there 's gon na be people with majority power over you			1
so you better learn right			0
you better change your ways			2
you better get with the program so that everybody likes you			0
" as is often the case when @entity77 charges into matters of race and ethnicity , he has it all wrong			1
and they 're presented not to pressure people to do " what the coming majority wants right now " as much as to highlight the value of doing the right thing by making our institutions more inclusive			1
stories like this are supposed to enlighten us and give us a heads up about what 's coming around the corner , so we can take advantage of the trend and not be overrun by it			0
elected officials , media companies and the business communities can put off thinking about the future , but they ca n't escape it			0
meanwhile , what people like @entity77 seem to be trying to escape is a reckoning for what happened in the past			1
as he sees it , all this talk about changing demographics is tied to a larger criticism of the @entity5 as having at times fallen short of its own principles of liberty , fairness and equality			1
" part of it is payback because this evil white majority has arranged things so they get all the spoils , " he said			1
" and then whatever they do n't want is what gets handed down			0
those days are about over , and the big change is coming			2
" what needs to change is this kind of thinking			2
in nearly 25 years of writing about politics , race and ethnicity , i 've never heard any member of a minority group talk about how they 're looking forward to " payback " once they 're in the majority			1
what i do hear quite a bit is that people of color believe in the greatness of this country , and they want to help write the next chapter in ways that benefit them and their families			1
they want a seat at the table , not because they feel entitled but because they feel they have something unique and valuable to offer			1
and they do n't want to get even ; they just want to get ahead			0
what 's wrong with that ? nothing			0
in fact , it 's in keeping with some of this country 's greatest traditions			2
the face of @entity5 is changing			1
but it 's heart and soul never will			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210			1

@entity5 @entity212 says that more than half the babies born in 2011 were minorities
@entity210 : people like @entity77 see the change as a threat
he says minorities are not looking forward to " payback " once they 're in the majority
@entity210 : minorities just want a seat at the table and to offer something back to the country
