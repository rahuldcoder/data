, " @entity9 " has a season 2 champ ! was it @entity11 , @entity12 , or @entity13 who won the $ 5 million recording contract and free @entity16 injections for life ? @entity12 ! the 37 - year - old country man from @entity19 has pulled it off ! he 's had a strong season of honest , consistent performances			1
@entity12 thanked the man upstairs ( @entity23 ? is he real ? ) first and foremost , and then country music fans for helping him achieve his dream of quitting his day job			1
" you know what ? congrats to you , " @entity12 's mentor @entity29 told @entity12 , a man he had never seen before in his life			1
this was a well - deserved win			1
i still do n't find @entity12 that spectacular , but let 's be honest -- it 's hard to seem glamorous when you 're sharing the stage with break - dancing toy soldiers and big - ass sculptures of reindeer			1
( " @entity9 " is so bad at most things , but in the cat - uh - gry of " going all out for @entity46 , " it is a true five - million - dollar winner			1
that is also how much they spent on sets tonight			2
) indeed , the three final acts got to indulge in some severe holiday blowout performances that were tons of fun while also being entirely 1 - 800 - too - much			2
for " @entity56 , " @entity12 maneuvered his way around four sparkly , human - sized breast cancer awareness ribbons wearing angel wings , not to mention those deer sculptures			1
twas a vision ! at one point during the epic season - long glare - off between the judges and the hosts , @entity60 coyly refused to reveal the dirty little metaphor he 'd just come up with in his head , and @entity67 delivered what will surely be the greatest non sequitur of his life : " i wan na know what a dog laying an egg sounds like , but that 's for another day			2
you guys ready for some crazy hats ? ! @entity0 : see all ' @entity9 ' recaps @entity11 -- excuse me , # @entity79 -- took on a classic @entity46 song as well , but what 's important here is their fastidiously chosen headwear			1
the wardrobe department ( or possibly @entity86 , who will one day rule us all ) decided to make @entity90 's @entity89 bows her " signature thing , " so all the others got to wear weird things too so as not to feel left out			2
i 'll rank them in order of my preference : 1			2
2 ) @entity100 's white mink hat and matching shrug , 3 ) @entity103 's fascinator with tons of netting , 4 ) @entity107 's parasol , and 5 ) @entity110 miserable " a red bird just died in this show " top hat			1
all were remarkable in their own ways , though , just like the members of @entity11 ! awww			1
i wanted them to win			2
they 'll at least get to make a record			2
@entity13 actually disappointed with her cover of " @entity120 , " suggesting maybe she ca n't really handle upbeat tunes , performance-wise			1
she looked frazzled and lost onstage , vying for attention with the breakdancing toy soldiers and billions of falling presents in the giant screens behind her			2
i 've never heard her voice waver like that			0
weird ! i also spent most of this wacky performance trying to figure out if @entity13 was wearing footed pajamas or boots			1
few things infuriate me more than matching boots and pants			0
the whole point of wearing boots is that they should be set apart and admired by all ! @entity8 dropped by to perform their ritual duty of reminding everyone they were once associated with " @entity9			1
" throughout " @entity142 " ( ugh enough with that ) @entity7 's performance of " @entity145 " and then , randomly , " @entity146 , " i began to involuntarily un-focus my eyes			0
it turns out that when viewed as a @entity149 poster , @entity7 and those 25 backup slinkys of his looked like @entity151 and his @entity152 human props			0
once i imagined it , i could not stop seeing it ! also , i had to just @entity157 the title of @entity151 's former game show and it took an embarrassing amount of time			0
like , double - digit seconds			0
what else ? that red carpet abomination at the top of the show was laughably awful , but at least it was quick			0
we saw @entity60 as a @entity169 ( his face looks better in neon green ) , an invigorating clip show of @entity60 's long - running lifeless tiff with @entity174 , and @entity175 looking horrified in the corner of the screen during a montage of her other horrified faces			0
my favorite filler segment , of course , was the mashup of everyone 's favorite sugarplum fairy @entity29 's incredible seated dance moves			0
" i 'll tell you what -- you were like a conductor ! " @entity67 marveled after reliving some of @entity29 's sweet moves			0
" i am a conductor , " @entity29 reminded him			0
" literally and figuratively , right there ! " continued @entity67 with some of his most impressive vocabulary to date			0
i 'm glad they got all of that settled			0
ate up a solid two minutes			0
that 's pretty much it ! are you happy with the winner ? were you surprised it was n't @entity13 ? which of @entity204 's costumes was your ( least ) fave : @entity206 lace gift pouch , inexplicable black wetsuit , or pink and gold @entity46 ribbon ? discuss ! see original story at @entity0			1
