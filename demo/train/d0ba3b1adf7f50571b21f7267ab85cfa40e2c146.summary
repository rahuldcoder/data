-- in his first court appearance in nearly two years , former police officer @entity1 entered an @entity4 courtroom friday for a hearing in his upcoming murder trial			1
wearing blue jail clothes , the former police sergeant walked in shackles and looked older and a bit thinner than his last appearance			0
he is accused of killing his third wife , @entity12 , in 2004			0
he remains under investigation in the october 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity15			0
judge @entity16 presided briefly on friday before the case was transferred to judge @entity18			1
the next hearing is set for may 17 , though no trial date has been set			1
friday 's hearing comes after a controversial ruling was made earlier this year in the widely followed murder case			1
in april , an @entity4 appellate court ruled that prosecutors can use potentially incriminating statements made by @entity27 and @entity1 's still - missing wife against him			1
that ruling overturned an earlier judge 's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by @entity27 before her death and by @entity15 before her disappearance			2
when @entity27 was found dead in 2004 , her death was ruled accidental			2
after @entity15 went missing in october 2007 , her husband became the focus of a police investigation			0
authorities exhumed @entity27 's body and conducted a second autopsy , this time ruling her death a homicide			0
since @entity27 is dead and @entity15 is missing , the defense has argued that using their alleged statements to family and friends violates @entity1 's @entity48 right to confront the witnesses against him			1
in general , hearsay statements made to third parties can not be introduced at trial unless a defendant can cross-examine the person who made them			2
there are some exceptions if prosecutors can prove the statement is reliable			0
but a new @entity4 law , which some call " @entity62 , " goes beyond those exceptions			2
the law , passed while investigators were looking for @entity15 , allows courts to consider statements from " unavailable witnesses , " provided prosecutors can prove the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony .			0

new : the case was transferred to judge @entity18
new : the next hearing is set for may 17 , though no trial date has been set
in april , an @entity4 appellate court ruled hearsay evidence may be used against @entity1
