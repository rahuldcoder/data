@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity1 gov. @entity4 thought her decision to step down might end ethics accusations against her , she quickly found out she was wrong			1
one dismissed claim cited gov. @entity4 's decision to wear an @entity11 logo during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest			1
just days after her bombshell resignation announcement , a new ethics complaint was filed with state authorities arguing that she should not be able to claim per diem funds when she stays at her @entity18 , @entity1 , home instead of @entity0 or @entity20 , where she has offices			1
the complaint says she was charging the state when she stayed in @entity18 and commuted to her offices			1
the governor 's mansion is located in @entity20			2
@entity4 claims she is the target of the " politics of personal destruction , " as she and some staff members face 19 filings regarding allegations of ethical violations			1
" it does n't cost the critics anything to file frivolous lawsuits or ethics violation charges			2
it costs our state such a great deal -- thousands of staff hours , millions of dollars in public resources that are n't going to things that it should be going to , " @entity4 told @entity2			1
" we have n't violated the ethics code			0
" the pressure and financial cost of such ethical investigations are a major reason cited by the governor in her decision not to finish her term			1
she said her family is facing more than $ 500,000 in legal fees and has set up a legal defense fund to help defray the costs			0
many of the complaints have been dismissed			0
but @entity4 last month reimbursed the state more than $ 8,000 for travel expenses for nine trips , accompanied by her children , after the state paid for them			1
another inquiry led to some new ethics training for a staff member			0
in all , state officials say they have spent $ 1,963,840 to answer records requests from the ethics filings and to respond in other ways to them			2
records show that since january 1 , 2008 , the state has spent $ 296,043 on such investigations			2
of these inquiries , the one that cost the most and drew the most attention was centered on whether @entity4 inappropriately fired the state 's director of public safety			1
this complaint had been filed weeks before @entity4 's run for vice president			1
the public safety director claimed he was let go because of his refusal to fire a state trooper who was @entity4 's former brother - in - law and who was locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor 's sister			1
@entity4 and her supporters argued it was because the director was insubordinate			2
an independent counsel found she had a right to fire him , but in doing so had violated a state ethics law			2
it found she had abused the powers of her office by pressuring employees to get the trooper fired			0
although the governor and her supporters have criticized the investigations , @entity107 , who has filed four complaints against @entity4 , thinks they are entirely appropriate			1
" i do n't really care what other people think			0
i am holding the governor accountable			1
other people 's ignorance is not going to stymie me , " @entity107 told @entity2 , surrounded by stacks of state documents she has collected from filing information requests and ethics complaints			2
" i am exercising my right to get these public records to discover what @entity4 is up to , " @entity107 said			0
@entity107 , a registered @entity124 , has filed four complaints , including one alleging a friend of @entity4 's was given preferential treatment in getting a state job			1
that filing was dismissed by a state board which investigates the claims			0
@entity107 has also filed two lawsuits , including one regarding whether it was appropriate for state business to be discussed using private e-mail addresses			0
when ethics complaints are filed against the governor or her staff , the state has to hire an independent counsel to investigate the claims to avoid conflict of interest			1
among other claims against @entity4 cite her wearing an @entity11 logo on a piece of clothing during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest and another contending an interview she did after the presidential election in her state office was inappropriate			2
@entity152 , a political science professor at the @entity153 , told @entity2 that , " some of [ the complaints against @entity4 ] are clearly fanciful , farcical			0
" i think most of these ethical complaints are trivial			0
almost all have been dismissed by the various levels of review that have taken them on , " @entity152 said			0
any filings already in process before she leaves office will be concluded			0
@entity4 had signed a law making it easier to file such complaints			0
" she 'd been pushing for that even before she was governor			0
to have it used in this way , to have it abused in the manner that it was is shameful			0
it 's much like the boy who cried ' wolf , ' " @entity170 , @entity4 's attorney , told @entity2 .			1
