-- " @entity1 ! what is it good for ? " sings @entity2 in his 1970 song , before giving an unambiguous answer : " absolutely nothing			2
" history , archaeology , and anthropology , however , suggest that the story is not so simple			2
in the @entity13 , humans were a rough lot			0
when people 10,000 years ago disagreed , they usually solved their arguments without violence ; but when they did decide to use force , they faced far fewer constraints than the citizens of functioning modern states			2
violence was normally on a small scale , in homicides , vendettas , and raids , but because populations were also tiny , the steady drip of killing took an appalling toll			0
by many estimates , 10 to 20 % of @entity13 humans died at other people 's hands			1
if we fast - forward to the 20th century , we see a stunning contrast			0
the century suffered world wars , genocides , and nuclear attacks , not to mention civil strife , riots , and murders			2
altogether , we killed a staggering 100 - 200 million of our own kind			0
but between 1900 and 2000 , roughly 10 billion lives were lived -- meaning that just 1 - 2 % of the world 's population died violently			1
so if you were lucky enough to be born in the 20th century , your risk of dying violently was just one - tenth of that in the @entity13 ; and since 2000 , the @entity53 tells us , the risk of violent death has fallen even further , to 0.7 %			1
these are astonishing statistics , but the explanation is more astonishing still			0
in perhaps the greatest paradox in history , what made the world safer was war itself			1
what happened , it seems , is that starting about 10,000 years ago , the winners of wars began incorporating the losers into larger societies			2
the victors then found that the only way to make these larger societies work was by developing stronger governments ; and one of the first things these governments had to do , if they wanted to stay in power , was suppress violence among their subjects			1
the men who ran these governments cracked down on killing not because they were saints , but because well - behaved subjects were easier to govern and tax than angry , murderous ones			0
states that suppressed violence within their borders tended to grow ; those that did not , tended to fail			0
@entity1 is surely the worst possible way to create larger , more peaceful societies , but the depressing truth is that it seems to be pretty much the only way people have found			1
if @entity91 could have been built without killing millions of @entity92 and @entity93 , or the @entity94 without killing millions of @entity95 -- in these and countless other cases , if conflicts could have been resolved by reason instead of force , the world would have reaped the benefits without paying such costs			1
but that did not happen			0
the reality is that people hardly ever give up their freedoms , including their freedom to kill and impoverish each other , unless forced to do so , and virtually the only force strong enough to scare people straight has been strong government			2
back in the 1600s the philosopher @entity111 nicknamed this " @entity114 , " after the terrifying monster of the @entity113			0
the process of making @entity114 was not pretty			0
whether it was the @entity117 in @entity118 or the @entity118 in @entity119 , pacification could be just as bloody as the savagery it stamped out			0
nor were all governments equally good @entity123			0
democracies , whatever their other faults , tend to value life more than dictatorships			0
nor did @entity114 always work the same way			0
in ancient times , the only way to run large , peaceful societies was by incorporating the conquered into empires , but in the last 200 years , the greatest powers -- @entity118 in the 1800s , the @entity94 since the late 1900s -- have worked best by leaving other countries formally independent while incorporating them into globalized economies			1
nor , finally , was the making of @entity114 smooth			0
some wars killed people without creating bigger , safer societies ; some even broke such societies down			1
but across 10,000 years , enough wars did create these bigger , better - governed groups that rates of violent death fell by 90 %			1
the 21st - century world does not have a global government enforcing peace , and far from producing such a government , another great - power war could potentially destroy humanity altogether			1
the world does , however , have a single great power -- the @entity94 -- capable of acting as a globocop , deterring other governments from using force			1
the @entity53 , @entity156 , the peace movement , and soft power generally have all done much to make the world a safer place since 1945 , but the lesson of history is clear			1
at the end of the day , in answer to the song 's question -- what has war been good for ? -- is that war created @entity114 , and @entity114 made the world safer			1
like it or not , the ultimate guarantee of peace is the order the @entity94 has created .			2

since 2000 , @entity53 says the risk of violent death has fallen to 0.7 %
in perhaps greatest paradox in history , what 's made the world safer is war itself , @entity176 says
war seems to be only way people have found to create peaceful societies , he argues
@entity176 : @entity188 has single great power -- @entity94 -- capable of deterring governments from using force
