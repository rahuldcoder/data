-- in 2012 , a strong web presence must be part of every political hopeful 's strategy			2
on the eve of tuesday 's @entity10 caucuses , the first official contest of this year 's presidential campaign , we take a look at how the seven @entity13 hopefuls are presenting themselves in the digital world of social media			1
this includes everything from tallying their @entity19 followers and @entity20 likes to comparing what kind of information they 're most likely to share online			1
we also compare their scores on @entity25 , a site that aims to measure someone 's influence based on their popularity on social media ( a number some consider dubious , but that more folks online are starting to pay attention to )			2
of course , these numbers may have no bearing on how the candidates actually fare with @entity10 caucusgoers			2
some of the candidates may have departed the race by wednesday night			2
and whoever survives the grueling process to presumably face president @entity42 in november may change digital strategies multiple times between now and then			0
but for now , here 's a snapshot of the current @entity13 field online ( in alphabetical order ; numbers current as of monday evening ) : @entity50 @entity19 followers : 36,262 ( a heartier 126,842 for her @entity53 account ) facebook page " likes " : 460,290 @entity57 channel views : 1,323,985 @entity25 score : 68 style : @entity50 tweets only sporadically from her @entity53 account but several times a day from her campaign account , which is full of upbeat messages and quotes from the candidate ( " i fight , i fight hard , and i fight for you " )			1
both her @entity19 feed and @entity20 page -- which seems to exist just to promote her campaign -- are full of pics of her on the stump in @entity10 , waving from her bus and greeting voters			1
sample tweet : " @entity73 ! in 2012 , we 're resolving to make @entity42 a one - term president			0
what 's your resolution ? " noteworthy : a gallery of @entity20 pics shows @entity50 attending the @entity10 - @entity83 football game in true politician style -- wearing a jersey that says " @entity10 " on one side and " @entity83 " on the other			2
in another photo , she has autographed a bald man 's head			2
@entity91 @entity19 followers : 1,385,524 facebook page " likes " : 224,267 @entity57 channel views : 6,310,555 @entity25 score : 78 style : @entity99 's @entity19 feed is largely made up of routine posts like photos from campaign events , links to newspaper endorsements and the like			1
the feed is sprinkled with few posts that appear personal , though , thanking supporters and responding to follower 's questions , for example			2
his @entity20 page appears to strictly be official campaign posts			2
sample tweet : " @entity91 's economic plan is ' the most aggressive now , and it shows you how timid @entity117 's is in comparison			1
' @entity119 " noteworthy : @entity99 , whose @entity19 follower count far exceeds any other @entity13 candidate , had a bit of a kerfuffle when a former staffer told reporters in august that the campaign had hired an agency to inflate that number with phony accounts			1
@entity99 denied it , although one analysis suggested that as few as 8 % of his followers were actually human			2
@entity136 @entity19 followers : 66,699 facebook page " likes " : 30,785 @entity57 channel views : 635,793 @entity25 score : 70 style : thanks in part to tweets and video clips from his daughters , @entity136 has definitely injected some personality into his online presence			1
in august , after @entity150 made comments that appeared to call the theory of evolution into question , @entity136 tweeted : " to be clear			1
i believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming			0
" sample tweet : " wishing everyone a @entity158			0
family tradition to serve at a homeless shelter in @entity162 on christmas day			0
" noteworthy : @entity136 's best social - media moment might have been in late november , when he fielded questions from followers live on @entity19			1
the event got some unexpected attention when " @entity169 " playfully pranked it , using its own @entity19 account to urge " @entity172 " fans to tweet questions to star @entity174 using @entity136 's identifying hashtag -- # @entity176			1
@entity177 @entity19 followers : 150,192 ( plus 96.605 for his @entity53 account ) facebook page " likes " : 675,897 @entity57 channel views : 35,591,936 ( note : he 's had the account since 2008			1
) @entity25 score : 75 style : @entity177 's @entity20 page has a dash of personality , including links to articles about him , photos of supporters and family events , and even the occasional " politician - with - baby " shot			0
under " likes " he lists his son , @entity201 sen. @entity200			0
sample tweet : " thank you for supporting today 's money bomb ! if you have n't had a chance yet , you can donate here : @entity207 " noteworthy : in 2008 , @entity177 was dominant online , with an active presence and diehard followers who flocked to push him to the top of online polls , even when the real polls did n't coincide			1
this year , other candidates have caught up with his campaign 's web presence , but he 's polling better in the numbers that matter			1
@entity150 @entity19 followers : 111,629 ( plus 24,209 for his campaign account ) facebook page " likes " : 180,211 @entity57 channel views : 13,075,616 @entity25 score : 74 style : @entity150 likes to tweet about running			1
he really , really likes to tweet about running			0
a big chunk of @entity150 's most recent tweets are photos of the spots in @entity10 , and elsewhere , in which he 's taken a jog			1
sample tweet : " very nice running trail around @entity234 , @entity10			0
. whatever it may be ! ! http://yfrog.com/obhyibvj " noteworthy : @entity150 's campaign got a lesson in social - media use after posting a campaign ad that bemoans the fact that gays can openly serve in the military and accused president @entity42 of waging a " war on religion			1
" but the campaign either forgot or chose not to disable comments on the video			0
the result ? it collected more than 730,000 " dislikes , " making it one of the most disliked videos on @entity57			1
( by comparison , @entity261 's " friday " has 367,000 , although it is in its second incarnation )			0
@entity117 @entity19 followers : 219,425 facebook page " likes " : 1,267,200 @entity57 channel views : no official channel @entity25 score : 78 style : both @entity117 's @entity19 feed and @entity20 page are made up entirely of posts that seem to be directly from the campaign			1
perhaps to maintain greater control over his message , @entity117 almost never retweets posts from others			0
sample tweet : " i believe in restoring the principles that made @entity201 great , and i 'll do that with your help tuesday night			0
" noteworthy : pranksters on @entity25 have used the ability to give someone " + k " -- basically , an endorsement -- in an area of influence and are taking a shot at @entity117 's reputation for changing positions on issues			0
behind " politics " and " conservative politics , " @entity117 's third area of " expertise " is " @entity300 ( fashion )			0
" it 's a casual shoe and a political insult , all rolled into one			0
@entity304 @entity19 followers : 52,800 facebook page " likes " : 42,147 @entity57 channel views : 43,326 @entity25 score : 70 style : with their " @entity314 " and " @entity315 to fight for @entity201 " slogans , @entity304 's web pages have a pugnacious tone			1
both his @entity20 and @entity19 feeds are full of links to positive articles and plugs for his tv and radio appearances			2
the first fact listed on his @entity19 bio , ahead of his status as a former @entity201 senator , is " @entity328 and i have seven children			2
" sample tweet : " sitting w son @entity331 talking about his 1st pheasant hunt in @entity10			0
a proud dad and @entity335 member ( with an a + lifetime rating btw ) # fb # iacaucus			0
" noteworthy : the @entity339 has n't always been kind to the former @entity201 senator from @entity341			0
when you @entity345 his name , a top result is a fake sexual byproduct we ca n't repeat here , an act of revenge by sex columnist @entity352 , who created the site because he objected to @entity304 's comments about homosexuality			0
@entity0 's @entity356 contributed to this story .			0

@entity13 presidential candidates have a varied *approach* to their online presences
@entity91 has the most @entity19 followers , but some question how he got them
@entity150 's campaign posted an ad on @entity57 that became its most disliked
