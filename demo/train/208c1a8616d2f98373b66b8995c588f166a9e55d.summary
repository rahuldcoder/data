-- @entity2 tennis legend @entity1 has been credited with changing how the modern game is played			1
in this month 's @entity4 , @entity1 sits down with fellow - @entity6 champion @entity5 to discuss his life and the impact he had on tennis in @entity2 and the world in general			1
@entity1 's domination in the 1970s left a long - standing legacy in @entity2 tennis , carried on by @entity14 and @entity15 -- with @entity16 flying the flag for the nation in the present day			1
but it was n't just @entity1 's success that inspired a generation and a nation -- his use of the double - handed backhand shot had never been seen before , and was to change the way tennis was played from then on			1
" basically i started playing double handed on both my forehand and backhand side because my first racket was very heavy , " said @entity1			1
" those old wooden rackets were heavy which is the reason why a lot of people started playing double - handed , for instance @entity34 and @entity36			1
" the difference with my backhand was that i was playing it with top spin which was something of a revolution			0
people kept telling me i could n't play them top spin and had to play the shots flat , " @entity1 added			2
" i remember a guy once gave me a book on tennis and said ' read this , it shows you how you are supposed to play ' -- but you know i am a bit stubborn and did not listen , so i carried on playing my backhand with top spin and that is how the whole thing started			2
" @entity14 , himself a winner of seven grand slam titles , told @entity4 that @entity1 's success , and the way he played , directly contributed to @entity2 's subsequent production line of great players			1
" the reason why @entity2 has had so many great players is because of @entity1			1
we saw the success he had and we decided to copy his style , " said @entity14			0
" other players were stuck in the 1960s and 1970s with an old fashioned way of playing and we were lucky to come into tennis at that time			2
" although @entity1 's unique double - handed backhanded helped make him the world greatest player , the 55 - year - old -- a winner of six @entity75 titles and five @entity6 crowns -- credits his first coach , @entity77 , with turning him into a top player			1
" when it comes to technique , nobody has more knowledge in the whole of @entity2 than @entity77 , " continued @entity1			2
" he can see immediately what kind of problem you have , or what you are supposed to do , and rectify it			0
" he was the @entity2 national coach when he came to my hometown , which was a real big deal back then			2
he told me that i had some potential and he was the person who took me to @entity93 to launch my career			0
" but it was not just @entity1 's style of play that made him so successful , the @entity2 also became the first player in the modern era to be able to switch from the slow clay of @entity101 to the grass courts of @entity103 with almost seamless transition , a skill he puts down to the @entity2 climate			1
@entity1 continued : " you know growing up in @entity2 meant we had a lot of rain when we played tennis			2
we were taught on clay courts but because of the weather , we had to go indoors a lot			0
" those indoor courts were very fast and that is how i learned to play on grass , even though clay was certainly my favorite surface			0
" at the beginning people would say about me , ' oh this guy will never be able to play good on grass because it is so different '			0
but i improved and learned how to adapt			0
" many experts believe @entity1 was the greatest player of all time , winning 11 grand slams despite retiring aged just 25			1
at the time , @entity1 's decision to quit tennis while he was at the top of his game caused controversy , but the man himself has no regrets and still feels he made the right choice			1
" i was very young when i stepped away from the game and if i had played another five more years i am sure i would have won more tournaments -- but we can only speculate about that , " added @entity1			2
" i had great rivalries back then , with people like @entity34 and @entity141 , but off the court we really respected each other and when i quit @entity144 kept on ringing me to say ' i do n't understand what you are doing '			0
" in the end , i just had to tell him to stop ringing me , because i was n't going to change my mind , " said @entity1			0
" i had just had enough and i lost the motivation to play			0
even if you just lose even a little bit of your motivation , it 's very difficult to carry on playing			0
" it came to a point when i did n't care if i was winning or losing -- and if you get to that situation then something is seriously wrong			0

@entity1 led the way for @entity2 players to become a success in the game
@entity1 won 11 major titles in a *glittering* career despite retiring aged just 25
@entity1 's double - handed backhand with *topspin* revolutionized the game of tennis
