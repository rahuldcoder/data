@entity2 , @entity3 -- " can you say that again ? you put a bullet through the wall in your house ? " @entity8 begins this evening at work like any , listening to troubled veterans in need of a sympathetic ear or immediate help			0
she reaches for a pen and paper			0
she 's a trained responder for the @entity18 's @entity17 in the @entity19 of @entity2			1

each year , more than 30,000 people kill themselves , 20 percent of them veterans , according to the @entity56			0
that 's 18 veteran suicides a day			2
every call presents another opportunity for the hot line responders to try to prevent another tragedy			1
the crisis center , staffed around the clock seven days a week , opened in july 2007 , largely borne from widespread criticism that the department was not responding adequately to veterans in crisis			1
@entity69 , the @entity70 , says the phones have n't stopped ringing since the hot line 's inception			1
" it 's about being able to provide them with immediate assistance , immediate resources , appointments			2

before the @entity18 suicide prevention program began , that was n't always the case			1

six months later , the @entity102 opened			0
to date , the crisis center has received almost 250,000 calls			2
" the health techs assist the counselors in getting the person the services they need at the time , " @entity69 says			1
" if they need emergency services or information , the health techs can pick that up , and find the person who can help them in their local area , and make those connections			2
" if necessary , the center arranges an emergency rescue , or in less dire circumstances , a wellness checkup at the caller 's home			2
the center also follows up the next day , according to @entity69			0
the 2010 hot line budget is more than $ 15 million , including staffing , phone and contract costs and more than $ 4 million for public messaging campaigns , according to the @entity18			1
the center 's newest feature is a chat line for those who prefer computer - oriented communication , especially young vets such as those who served in @entity91 and @entity138			1
" since that 's been open , we 've talked to several thousand people over the chat and have been able to facilitate some rescues through that service			2
" chat counselor @entity145 recalls an incident while chatting with a @entity148 vet who barricaded himself in his house , with two children asleep upstairs , as he suffered flashbacks from @entity91			1
" when the police broke in , i heard he had a gun , and i was hoping bad things were n't going to happen to him , " @entity145 says			0

" hot line responder @entity164 is in the @entity166 , and he just returned from serving in @entity138			1
" for me , it 's kind of hitting two birds with one stone , because i get to work with guys that have worn the uniform , and i still wear the uniform today , so , it 's always meant a lot to me to work here , " says @entity164			0
many callers are recent @entity91 and @entity138 veterans who struggle with reintegration , he said			1
often , they 're too proud to pick up a phone and ask for help			0
the main goal is " to listen to them , and to validate what they 're going through , and provide them services , " he said			0
@entity69 says it 's all in an important day 's work			0
" i feel lots of times it 's their last hope , their last chance , and if we can provide that little bit of hope , and get them to realize that they called and there are options , " says @entity69			0
" it 's an amazing feeling			0
