-- fifty years ago , @entity2 's living rooms were interrupted with images of peaceful protesters in @entity5 or @entity6 or @entity7 being bitten by police dogs , sprayed with fire hoses and pummeled by batons			1
fifty years later , @entity2 again are witnessing similar images , this time from @entity12 , @entity13 , near @entity14			1
the shooting death of @entity16 and the subsequent police clampdown on protests in 2014 is frighteningly similar to how law enforcement treated civil rights marchers and the media in 1964			1
this time , their tools are stun grenades and assault weapons			0
and again , the press is not just the witness , we have also become the victims			0
@entity30 , a reporter from the @entity32 who just accepted the @entity34 ' @entity33 , and @entity35 of the @entity36 , were camped out in a local @entity37 , simply recharging their phones and laptops , when several @entity14 police officers dressed in full combat gear decided -- allegedly for safety reasons -- they had to go			1
when @entity35 and @entity30 apparently did not move fast enough , they were arrested			0
they were released a short time later without charges			0
yes , law enforcement officers from @entity2 's heartland , sworn to protect @entity2 citizens -- black and white -- apparently saw it necessary to defy the first amendment by arresting reporters who were simply doing their jobs			1
fifty years ago , the mainstream media failed miserably because its virtually all - white reporting corps did not have the life experience to explain the reasons behind the protest marches			0
and stories of the attacks on protesters too often were told from the viewpoint of the police			1
this created an atmosphere of distrust and hostility and eventually it became unsafe for white reporters to venture into the black community			2
so media companies responded by hiring black reporters to cover what became known as the " @entity75 , @entity76 " of 1967 -- where more than 100 race riots rocked the @entity2			2
by the way , that decision eventually led to the creation of the @entity34			0
fast - forward to 2014 , when a police officer fired on an unarmed @entity16 -- who reportedly had his hands raised in surrender			2
he died of multiple gunshot wounds			0
@entity12 police brought in @entity90 to investigate the shooting and to handle the protests			1
and then all hell broke loose			0
wednesday night , the police used tear gas , smoke bombs and stun grenades to break up what reporters described as a peaceful crowd			1
perhaps they were too busy with their assault weapons and tactical vehicles to get around to the dogs and fire hoses			0
i have covered dozens of protests			2
i have always worn my press credentials			0
i have experienced the acrid , sweet smell of tear gas during the @entity113 demonstrations in 2013			0
yet , i have never been arrested			0
what planet are these police officers on ? where did they get their training ? in what manual is it spelled out that it 's ok to arrest and manhandle peaceful demonstrators , much less exhausted reporters simply trying to file their stories and recharge the cell phones at a @entity37 ? journalists are there to report on the protests			1
we document those people who break into @entity131 and beauty supply stores for whatever reason			0
we report on those protesters who bring backpacks filled with bottles , rocks , hammers and spray paint cans , as well as those who march peacefully through the streets to bring attention to a perceived injustice			0
we also report on police behavior , some of which does not always comply with their own police policy			2
during @entity113 , reporters documented violations of police procedure			1
the police department later used our reporting as justification for re-training officers			1
we ca n't do our jobs if the police look at us the same as a guy wearing a ski mask throwing rocks			1
we ca n't do our job if we are arrested for shooting video of police behavior			2
and one note to the @entity90 : you do not have the right to tell reporters to turn off their video cameras			2
read the law , please			0
what is happening in @entity12 is disturbing for many reasons			1
forget that the police in @entity12 used chemical weapons and blunt force to break up a peaceful demonstration			1
forget that @entity35 and @entity30 were released without charges after being detained			2
they also said they had been roughed up			0
their arrests should send chills up and down the backs of every citizen ... and news manager			2
if the police felt it was ok to arrest two reporters for not moving fast enough , you can only imagine how they are treating the residents of @entity12 when the reporters are not there and the cameras are not recording			1
this is @entity2 in 2014			0
complete coverage on the @entity12 shooting and protests join us on @entity198 / @entity197 .			1
