@entity0 -- @entity2 was ready for her cruise in the @entity4 when news of the economic crisis in @entity7 , her home country , began to worsen			1
@entity8 , a program coordinator for the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , canceled her trip and decided that she would instead spend her vacation money in @entity7			0
like a growing number of her fellow expatriates , @entity2 hopes to bolster the teetering @entity7 economy -- roiled again on tuesday by a wave of violent protests and a countrywide strike against proposed austerity measures -- through tourism			2
it accounts for 15 % of the country 's jobs and 18 % of its gdp , according to the @entity7 @entity28			2
" i want to support @entity7 by spending my money there ; it 's very important when your country 's in trouble to do whatever you can , " @entity2 said			2
" i ask people why they 're going back , why they do n't go somewhere else , and they say , ' now , @entity7 needs us			0
' " @entity2 said that more members of her community , largely motivated by pride of country , are vacationing in @entity7 than ever before			0
this perception was corroborated by @entity41 , president of the @entity43 chapter of the @entity44 , who said the number of @entity7 - @entity43 visiting home has surged and is expected to increase anywhere from 20 % to 30 % in 2011 from 2010			1
" ( @entity52 ) have an obligation to go because @entity7 needs the help right now , " said @entity41 , who added his organization has launched a campaign to encourage @entity7 - @entity43 to travel there			1
" there 's been a call from outside that @entity7 needs help			0
" this year 's 10 % increase in income from @entity43 tourists , who spend three times more than the average traveler , was huge for @entity7 's economic development , said @entity64 , the director of the @entity43 office of the @entity66			1
despite @entity7 's debt crisis and crippling unemployment , @entity67 said tourism is booming			1
" in crises , other tourists postpone their trips to our country ; this year , the @entity7 - @entity43 will come and they will bring all their friends , " @entity67 said			1
@entity67 added that the @entity7 government had encouraged tourism from @entity43 by loosening regulations on cruise ships , eliminating taxes for airlines and cutting fees for hotels			1
still , for many @entity85 , attempts to visit @entity7 have been hamstrung by high airfare prices and a sputtering economy at home			2
" it 's depressing and sad watching our country , which is dependent on tourists , " said @entity89 , owner of @entity91 custom furniture , who is not returning to @entity7 for the first time in several years			2
" but there 's no money to go ( and ) the tickets are expensive , the euro is expensive , the hotels are expensive			0
" @entity101 , a member of the @entity102 , agreed , saying he had to postpone his trip from @entity104 , @entity105 , to @entity7			0
" everything 's become so expensive due to what 's going on , it 's making it even harder for @entity7 - @entity43 to make the trip , " @entity101 said			1
but even if they can not return to visit , @entity7 - @entity43 say that their country never travels far from their thoughts			1
" it 's scary ; it 's frightening ; it 's hurtful to wake up every day and watch and see the coverage of everything that 's going on in @entity7			0
... we ca n't help but feel bad that our brothers and sisters have to go through this , " said @entity118 , editor and publisher of a @entity7 newspaper , @entity121			0
like @entity125 , the @entity121 is urging its readership to visit @entity7 this summer			0
" we can not save the @entity7 economy , raise 100 billion dollars , and give it to them , so what we can do is spend our money in @entity7 -- and hope and pray things will improve			0
