gen. @entity9 , the chairman of the @entity10 , told the @entity11 that it was possible that @entity1 troops advising and assisting @entity4 's military could be deployed to fight			1
" to be clear , if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity4 troops on attacks against specific @entity6 targets , i will recommend that to the president , " @entity9 said during testimony before the committee			1
@entity9 's comments , which he made several times under questioning by senators , contradicts president @entity28 's promise that the campaign to defeat and destroy the terrorist group that calls itself the @entity31 would not include @entity1 " boots on the ground			1
" @entity1 airstrike hits @entity6 target near @entity36 , first in ' expanded efforts ' the contradiction quickly raised a question for the @entity8 : how is serving as " close combat advisers " -- in @entity9 's words -- not a combat role ? sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , the ranking member of the @entity11 , pressed @entity9 on the issue at one point in the hearing , asking if pilots dropping bombs in @entity4 were part of a combat mission and if the @entity1 would rescue any pilots shot down			1
@entity9 responded " yes and yes			2
" top @entity1 military officer : @entity1 ground troops to fight @entity6 , if necessary the @entity28 administration moved quickly to tamp down any suggestion that the @entity1 would deploy combat troops			1
even defense secretary @entity58 , who was seated next to @entity9 at the @entity11 committee hearing , repeated the president 's promise			2
@entity8 spokesman @entity62 reiterated @entity28 's position , telling reporters that @entity1 troops -- some 1,600 -- in @entity4 were serving in advise - and - assist roles , staffing the joint operation centers and defending the @entity68 in @entity36 and the consulate in @entity70			2
" what he 's been very specific and precise about is that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role into @entity4 or @entity76 , " @entity62 told reporters			1
war against @entity6 : what does @entity78 's ' yes ' mean ? the @entity81 's spokesman , rear adm. @entity80 , characterized @entity9 's statement as a hypothetical , saying on @entity84 's " @entity83 " that the chairman was speaking about his " best military advice " should @entity1 troops in @entity4 need to act in an advise - and - assist role with " lower level units			1
" " if he felt that the strategy as it was being proposed and executed was failing that he would not hesitate to change his advice to the commander in chief about maybe putting advisers in lower level units out there , " @entity80 said			0
" but he also said that he supports the strategy that we are executing right now , and he also said that he does n't believe we are at that stage right now			0
" even so , when pushed during his testimony to expand on his statement , @entity9 told the senators that if the current approach fails , he may recommend the use of ground troops			1
@entity106 : vote on war against @entity6 ? do n't be silly the committee hearing came as the @entity8 prepares to vote to give the president authorization to arm and train moderate @entity76 rebel groups that have been vetted			0
a @entity11 vote on the measure would follow			0
the @entity28 administration has , however , ruled out putting @entity1 military advisers on the ground in @entity76			1
early in his testimony , @entity9 also seemed to lay out a new version of the administration 's mission , saying it was to " destroy " @entity6 in @entity4 and to " disrupt " it in @entity76			2
the hearing was interrupted several times by antiwar protesters from the groups @entity126 and @entity127 , each of whom chanted and held up signs until they were ejected			0
" there is no military solution , " one woman chanted			0
" @entity1 does not want war			0
