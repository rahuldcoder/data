-- on october 20 , 2001 , a concert was held in @entity2 to benefit the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
on stage were some of the biggest names in show business			2
in the audience were first responders who had been working around the clock at ground zero			2
to those watching on television , the most memorable thing about the evening was not the performers on stage			2
it was the faces of those in the crowd			2
some of them were in tears			2
for the first time in weeks , it seemed , they had set aside their anguish and were having a good time			2
by far , though , the emotional high point of the evening came when @entity34 took the stage toward the end of the night			1
after opening with " @entity38 " and following that with " @entity40 , " the band played " wo n't get fooled again			2
" at that moment , a different mood seemed to take hold across the room			0
the anguish turned to anger and the remorse turned to resolve			0
and as @entity47 let out a guttural scream to conclude the song , the crowd , as if one , raised their fists in the air and let out a scream of their own : " @entity56 ! ! " at that same moment , one could almost picture president @entity57 watching from the residence at the @entity59 doing the same thing			1
after all , he was by all accounts briefed less than two months earlier that @entity62 was planning to launch an attack on the @entity64			1
if anyone was fooled on 9/11 , it was most assuredly him			1
and if anyone had reason to vow to never let something like this happen again , it was the one individual who took an oath to keep this nation secure			0
three years later , the @entity76 anthem " @entity77 " would often be cited as the unofficial song of the 2004 @entity57 re-election campaign			1
yet looking back on it now , one could argue that a more appropriate song for the @entity57 administration was the anthem @entity34 played that october saturday night			1
the song not only defined @entity57 's time in office in the years following 9/11 , but also provided a lens through which nearly every policy decision could be viewed			1
the decision to invade @entity89 is a good example			0
the wisdom of invading this country is still being debated , but the rationale behind the decision to do so was clear : @entity95 claimed he had weapons of mass destruction , and most of the world 's leading intelligence agencies claimed he had them , as well			0
in light of the fact that he had ignored intelligence reports before 9/11 , it is understandable that @entity57 did not want to make the same mistake again			1
critics say that he overreacted , and in light of the fact that @entity110 were never found , they are correct			0
but as @entity114 sen. @entity113 recently stated , " i 'd rather , in the interest of protecting people , overreact rather than underreact			0
" @entity113 's statement is notable not because it was aimed at president @entity57 , but because it was aimed at president @entity116			1
specifically , it was aimed at the underwhelming response of the @entity116 administration to the failed attempt to blow up a @entity64 passenger jet on christmas day			1
it also points to a larger problem facing the president as he begins his second year in office -- namely , the fact that the failures of 9/11 seem to have been forgotten by his administration and his allies on @entity130			1
first , members of the intelligence community failed to connect the dots that would have flagged the young @entity135 bomber as a potential terrorist and prevented him from getting on the plane			0
then , federal law enforcement officials decided to treat the bomber as a common criminal instead of an enemy combatant , giving greater priority to finding him an attorney than getting to the bottom of this evil plot			0
the administration now reports the would - be bomber is cooperating and providing useful information			1
but it 's also true that we are engaged in a conflict that can not be litigated			0
we are fighting a war , not fighting crime			0
this is why @entity155 and the president established a military commission process in the years following 9/11 to deal with terrorist threats of this nature			2
it 's also why attorney general @entity165 , in the face of protests by mayor @entity163 and other local officials , is backing off plans to prosecute accused 9/11 mastermind @entity167 in a federal court in @entity169			2
to make matters worse , it 's not just the @entity116 administration that is failing to heed the lessons of 9/11			1
the @entity175 leadership on @entity130 also appears to have forgotten the failures of that day			0
for example , one of the recommendations of the @entity179 was that @entity155 streamline committee oversight with regard to homeland security			0
in 2007 and 2008 , officials from the @entity186 appeared at more than 370 hearings and gave more than 5,000 briefings to staffers and members from 108 committees			0
despite this jurisdictional nightmare , the leadership remains resistant to reform			0
hopefully , it wo n't take another 9/11 for the president and his allies to regain their sense of urgency and prepare for another attack			2
we know it 's coming			0
according to @entity205 , the director of national intelligence , an attack could come in the next six months			0
security is being heightened at numerous public events as a result			0
that includes this weekend 's @entity210 , where @entity34 will be performing at halftime			1
president @entity116 will no doubt be watching the game			1
when @entity34 takes the stage , if he is watching their performance , let 's hope he hears the same message first responders heard during the concert at @entity2 in 2001			1
let 's hope we do n't get fooled again			0
to view a clip of @entity34 's performance at @entity2 on october 20 , 2001 , click here the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

after 9/11 , @entity64 were resolved not to fall victim to terrorism again , says @entity227
@entity227 says a 2001 performance by @entity34 captured that spirit
he says @entity57 administration ignored *warnings* before *september* 11
@entity227 : @entity116 team has not shown zeal to *aggressively* respond to the threat
