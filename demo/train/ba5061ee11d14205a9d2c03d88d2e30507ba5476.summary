-- as usual , professor @entity2 's piece in the monday morning @entity3 is causing a great deal of chatter among the political types			0
@entity2 points out just how inept the @entity8 field is			1
in some cases he takes a scalpel ( and in others a machete ) to surely the weakest field of presidential aspirants any party has offered in modern @entity17 history ( see my earlier @entity0 column comparing this field to 1980 )			1
i believe i can explain why this field is so inept			0
in order to proffer this explanation i am going to utilize professor @entity2 's field of economics			1
hold on : i confess i 've never taken an economics course and if you ask me the relationship between interest rates and bond prices i would have a @entity33 moment			0
i could probably get the right answer but it would take me a while			0
there are some laws of economics that i believe all economists ( be they salt , fresh , or brackish water ) would agree on			0
one of these is : the more valuable a thing , the more people will be interested in purchasing that thing			1
and as professor @entity2 points out in his piece , the 2012 @entity8 nomination was clearly considered by most observers to be a thing of value			1
even the most partisan @entity51 -- me for example -- would concede that three months ago the @entity8 had an excellent chance to win the presidency			2
so ask yourself : why does this thing that appears to have so much value have so many low bidders ? why did people like @entity60			1
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and sen. @entity65 , all look at this and decide not to raise their paddles ? so here we wind up with the political equivalent of the @entity71 going for $ 99.99			0
i think that these guys were smart enough to see a big flaw in the process and it is this : the majority of the people in the @entity8 who were going to pick their nominee had been so overwhelmed by misinformation , unworkable simplistic solutions -- e.g. , electrifying border fences -- and anti-science , right - wing pandering , that the potential candidates decided they just could not go through with it			1
we have watched @entity8 debates where audience members booed gay soldiers and cheered the prospect of someone dying without health insurance			2
we 've seen a candidate who was n't penalized in the least for not knowing that @entity92 has had nuclear weapons since 1964 but had to drop out because of a consensual sexual relationship			0
we have seen a member of the @entity96 who apparently did n't realize that we have n't had an embassy in @entity98 for the last 30 years , candidates who do n't believe in evolution , and a candidate that did n't even know the voting age in the @entity17			2
maybe @entity64 , @entity62 , @entity61 , @entity63 and @entity65 figured out ahead of time what @entity105 uncovered just recently : that people who watch @entity108 are actually more ignorant than people who watch no news at all			0
could you imagine what they would have found had they studied people listening to talk radio ? perhaps the @entity8 are getting exactly the kind of candidates that best match the intellectual composition of the majority of the people in their party -- just a thought , but it 's my only explanation of our low bidders			1
looks like their chance at the presidency is going , going , gone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			2

@entity131 says the @entity8 field for president is very weak and he thinks he knows why
he says economics says that if a thing has value , people want it , but few want this *job*
he says good candidates shied away because they could n't take low level of *discourse*
@entity131 : @entity8 getting candidates that match intellectual composition of many in the party
