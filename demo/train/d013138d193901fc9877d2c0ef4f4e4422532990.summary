@entity1 women are taking to the streets to demand that the government takes domestic violence seriously , by introducing laws to protect women from abusive partners			1
@entity8 , a founder of feminist collective @entity9 , says the prevalence of unveiled , glamorous women in @entity12 can create the impression that @entity1 is more liberated from patriarchal cultural attitudes than neighboring countries			2
but that 's merely an illusion , she says			0
" the problem is that we are sold a lot of fake freedoms that raise @entity1 women under the impression that they have freedom to go anywhere , freedom to dress the way they want to , " she said			0
for the past year and a half , @entity28 and fellow feminist activists have been demanding that politicians ignore the objections of @entity34 religious authorities and pass a stalled law protecting women from domestic violence			1
a draft version of the law to protect women from @entity41 was approved by @entity1 's @entity42 in 2010 , but has since become bogged down in parliament , mainly due to the objections of @entity45 and @entity47 authorities			1
the initial version of the bill was drafted to criminalize physical and sexual abuse , so - called " honor crimes " and marital rape , create specially - trained domestic violence response units within the police , and provide the legal framework for restraining orders to be issued against abusers			1

@entity72 , @entity1 's top @entity45 authority , and the @entity74 both said that they opposed the draft on the basis that @entity79 law protected the status of women , and should remain the basis for governing legal issues related to @entity34 families			1
domestic violence cases in @entity1 are typically heard in the religious courts , which often respond with rulings focused on preserving the family unit , rather protecting women from violence			1
it 's a response that abused women are usually met with from police as well , says @entity1 lawyer @entity94			2
" they are told to solve the problem amicably , to keep it a family issue and not cause embarrassment to themselves by bringing it to the police , " said @entity94 , who specializes in domestic violence cases			2
he said the law also failed to recognize marital rape as a crime -- a position that some @entity34 judges argue should be upheld			2
criminalizing marital rape " could lead to the imprisonment of the man , " @entity108 , a judge in the @entity45 religious court , told @entity110 , " where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights			1

one @entity1 mother - of - three told @entity110 of being beaten by her husband from the time she was pregnant with their first child			1
shortly after the child was born , he broke her nose and she resolved to divorce him			0
but her parents were mortified about what people would think , and said she would have to give up her son if she left			0
she returned to the marital home where the abuse continued , including her husband forcing himself on her			0
" he used to make me pregnant , thinking that as long as i was having kids he would make me stay , " she said			0
she feared he would kill her			0
but eventually , with the help of a @entity145 ( " enough " ) -- an @entity147 tackling violence and exploitation of women and children -- she was able to divorce her husband and retain custody of her children			0
such an outcome is rare for abused women in @entity1 -- a situation that was now unlikely to be remedied by the passing of the domestic violence bill , says @entity8			1
her organization heard of about 15 cases a year of @entity1 women murdered by their domestic partners , she said			2
@entity8 said the draft bill had been watered down with so many amendments due to objections by religious conservatives , that it was virtually useless			0
she said she would ultimately prefer not to see it pass			0
" if it passes the way it is , it 's going to be disastrous and counterproductive , " she said .			0

a law to protect women from domestic violence in @entity1 has stalled in parliament
it is opposed by religious **groups** which claim it will erode the power of religious courts
feminist **groups** are *protesting* the delay , saying women have few legal protections in @entity1
one judge from a @entity45 religious court told @entity110 marital rape was a husband 's " right "
