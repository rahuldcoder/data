-- a woman approached me as i was rushing toward the @entity3 after giving a talk on rape in @entity6 last month			1
she asked in a low voice if she could share some information			0
she had dvds , she said			0
on them were testimonies of @entity6 women who 'd been raped ; in particular , a mother , a daughter and a sister all in one family			1
in a taxi recently en route to @entity19 , i was told another startling story			0
the driver turned to me and said , " i am @entity6			1
and i have a story to tell you that i keep wishing is not true			0
" his eyes welled up as he relayed what his neighbor said happened to a friend			0
the neighbor described being stopped in his car at a @entity6 checkpoint on the road from @entity34 to @entity35			2
he said army officers told him to leave his daughter with them			0
my driver said he knew no other details than this , that the man had been given a horrific choice to make : leave his daughter behind , or his wife and other children would be killed in front of his eyes			2
the man made a decision , the driver said			0
he left his daughter at the checkpoint and drove on			0
i keep wishing it is not true , too , but what i told the driver that day is that his story sounds all too familiar : of the hundreds of cases of sexualized violence against @entity6 women and men i have heard and documented as the director of the @entity59 project at the @entity60 , many fit this pattern of women and girls being raped at checkpoints			1
read more : @entity6 family hides from attacks in underground ' prison ' and the story from the woman in @entity70 falls all too neatly into the pattern of ripping apart families -- rape and other forms of sexualized violence have long been used as a tool of war to destroy not only individual bodies but entire communities			1
what is happening in @entity6 is no exception			2
in an attempt to not lose a single story that could be used as possible evidence for future war crimes trials , we are documenting reports of sexualized violence on a live , crowd - sourced map on @entity6			1
we know , however , that evidence of crimes is being destroyed every day : more than 20 % of the women in our reports are found dead or are killed after rape			1
broken down by type of crime and perpetrator , each case is marked as a red dot on the map and contains up to dozens or even hundreds of victims			2
each dot is a life or lives potentially ripped apart by a horrific act of violence , an act that is particularly powerful as a weapon in @entity6 , where honor is so highly prized			1
rape is tearing @entity6 apart			1
the concept of purity is destroying their lives on top of it			0
the @entity115 , referring to @entity6 , reported in august that " girl - child survivors of rape are frequently married to their older cousins or other male members of the community , to ' save their honor			1
' " participants in adolescent girl groups told the @entity115 that if a girl is raped , " sometimes she might be killed by her family			2
... she knows that she will be dishonored for the rest of her life			0
" honor killings , forced marriages and divorce are just a few of the ways shame is destroying lives in @entity6			1
there is also suicide when the shame becomes too much to bear , such as the story on our map telling of a girl in @entity141 who reportedly killed herself by jumping off a balcony after rape			1
but the concept of honor is failing @entity6 women in another way			1
read more : @entity148 stands with @entity149 as @entity6 violence spills over borders " what i always think about is how women have tried to persuade the perpetrators not to attack them by asking to think of them as their sisters , " said one of the @entity6 researchers on our mapping project			1
" in @entity163 culture , a real man will protect his sister at any price			0
he is expected to take revenge if someone dishonors her			0
his sister is his responsibility even if she is married because blood relation is stronger than marriage			0
the women were appealing to whatever remnant of manhood and @entity163 honor these attackers might still have			2
unfortunately , they had none			0
" the unending " dishonor " and manipulation of @entity6 through sexualized violence is committed by all sides , although the majority of our reports indicate government perpetrators			1
it is creating an entire nation of traumatized people : not just the survivors of the acts , but their children as well			0
it is time to stop it all			0
there are measures the world can take to bring these horrors to an end			0
shame should never fall on victims , but should be used to compel @entity201 to join a @entity203 call for the @entity6 government 's alleged crimes to be referred to the @entity206			1
governments can help humanitarian groups that offer medical and psychosocial services for survivors			0
@entity6 women 's rights organizations are already taking action to combat and respond to gender - based violence , including organizing family - based care for displaced children of survivors			1
the international community can and should support @entity6 civil society in this work			1
shame is a powerful feeling that causes retreat			2
it causes us to lower our heads and look away			0
but we have a chance to lift up the survivors of sexualized violence in @entity6 and honor them by paying attention , by caring enough to bring their suffering to an end , by telling them that we do not accept the violence against them			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			2

@entity239 : rape is a weapon that destroys individuals , families , communities
@entity239 's group is documenting reports of rape as they come in on live map of @entity6
@entity239 : more than 20 % of women in reports are killed after rape ; some kill themselves
@entity257 shame drives killings , she says , and international community must *intervene*
