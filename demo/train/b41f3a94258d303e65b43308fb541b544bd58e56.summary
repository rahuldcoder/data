it 's december 23 , 2022			0
it 's the last friday before @entity3 and it 's carnage on the streets of @entity6			0
this is " @entity8 " and then some			0
thanks to the huge numbers of office @entity3 parties , paramedics , bouncers and doctors are struggling to scrape binge drinking @entity17 off the pavement			2
tuesday saw a commission set up by @entity20 , world soccer 's governing body , recommend what was already the worst held secret in sport : that the @entity27 finals in @entity28 should be moved from the oppressive heat in the summer to the cooler winter months			1
some initial reports suggest that december 23 could be the day of the @entity27 final			1
if the right - leaning @entity17 tabloid @entity33 thought @entity8 2014 was bad , it might find december 23 , 2022 really will signal the end of days			0
at least that 's the impression you get from the reaction to a possible winter @entity27			1
discounting the fact that " winter " is a relative term ( there have already been six @entity27 finals hosted during winter months in the southern hemisphere , ) the reaction has been almost universally negative ; a sign not just of @entity28 's perceived ability to change the rules of the game , but also of @entity20 's mendacity			1
ever since @entity28 was announced as host in december 2010 , questions have been raised about its ability to host the finals in june and july when the temperature can reach 50 degrees @entity55			2
other dates were mooted such as february / march 2022 , but that drew a strong reaction from the @entity59 as it clashed with the @entity60			0
broadcaster @entity61 , which had paid an inordinate sum to secure @entity27 broadcast rights , must be angry with that possibility too , as it coincided with one of the biggest advertising paydays in world sport : the @entity70			1
and @entity71 , @entity72 's governing body , was also against that date as it clashed with the @entity74 , the richest competition in world football			1
may was suggested , when the temperatures were lower , but not low enough			0
so , the battle was set for november and december , a date that @entity71 appears to have begrudgingly accepted as the best of a bad bunch			0
most @entity72 leagues have a winter break that could be moved forward a month to accommodate the finals			1
the main loser appears to be the @entity86 who will have to find a month long hole in its schedule , plus recovery time			0
@entity91 , the league 's ceo who has just signed a record Â£ 5.1 billion tv deal , is livid			2
he 's a man that 's not accustomed to being dictated to			0
" @entity20 keep their international dates , they keep their @entity27 intact , even @entity71 , who , i think , let us down a little bit , clearly pushed , " he said after the meeting			1
the 2022 dates means @entity105 football 's traditional @entity3 football period -- where a quick succession of matches would be played starting the day after @entity3 -- would go out of the window			2
but would a winter @entity27 really be the disaster it is being painted as ? surely , as the @entity72 nights draw in and in the run up to @entity3 , a schedule of international matches on free to air television would be a huge draw to viewers in @entity72 ? given the public 's affinity with football tv ratings records would be smashed			1
a @entity27 in november and december might arguably also provide the impetus for @entity105 football to reform itself			1
the lack of a winter break has meant that the national team rarely performs well at big international tournaments after a long grueling season			2
@entity126 who won last @entity27 , took a six week winter break december to january			1
over that time , @entity86 teams played seven league matches , plus cup games			0
it would be an opportune time to introduce one			0
one other issue is the global aspect of the game			2
insisting on june - july for every @entity27 finals excludes much of the world from ever hosting the tournament , including the @entity141			1
a @entity27 in december would be a unique experience for those who travel there , if a little cold			2
in reality , this is n't an argument about the timing of the finals as much as represents deep anger at @entity20 and by extension @entity28			0
there are still huge , unanswered questions surrounding the corruption allegations that have surrounded the successful bid			1
and why exactly did the likes of @entity71 president @entity157 vote for a summer @entity27 when the issue of temperature were well known , including in @entity20 's own technical report which deemed a @entity28 @entity27 high risk ? and then there 's an issue of migrant worker rights			1
@entity28 has promised changes to the @entity167 system and rightly so			0
no @entity27 should ever be built by workers with such a tenuous grasp over their own destinies			2
but @entity28 winning the bid to host the @entity27 has , by accident and under pressure from the intense media glare that followed it , enhanced visibility of this exploitation , not diminished it			1
the @entity27 has made reform of the system more likely , not less			2
until @entity28 won the bid in 2010 , reporting on the issue was negligible			0
previously the @entity181 would be routinely dismissed as a necessary step towards global development , like migrants arriving in the @entity185 to build the @entity185 dream			0
that view is now not heard			0
take @entity28 out of the equation and you are left with one question : what would actually be wrong with a winter @entity27 ? we talk big about football being a global game , why not make it truly global ? worry less about the cash - rich @entity86 having to make alterations to their schedule , and worry more about the paramedics , bouncers and doctors on 23 , december 2022			1
and brace yourself for the blackest of @entity203 .			0

a winter @entity27 has some *positives* , argues football *writer* @entity206
it will bring huge tv *audiences* in @entity72 and open the game to the rest of the world
questions still *remain* over conduct of bid vote
