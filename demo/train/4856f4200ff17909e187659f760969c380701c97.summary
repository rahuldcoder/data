@entity0 -- the much - maligned , color - coded @entity2 is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history			1
not that anyone is really paying attention			2
homeland security secretary @entity7 is expected to announce thursday that the almost 9 - year - old threat alert system will go away in april			1
it will be replaced by the new @entity11 that will focus on specific threats in geographical areas , a department source said wednesday			1
the source did not provide details of the new system , which @entity17 will unveil at what the department is calling " the first annual ' state of @entity23 's @entity22 ' address " at @entity24			1
the top @entity25 and @entity26 on the @entity27 reacted positively to the news , although committee chairman rep. @entity29 , @entity31 - @entity30 , reserved judgment on the specifics			1
" though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of september 11 , it was clearly time for the current color - coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system , " @entity29 said			1
" i know they have been working on this for a long time			0
it sounds to me like the changes they are proposing make sense			1
we will have to wait and see how they implement this new , more targeted system			1
i expect the biggest challenge for @entity22 will be balancing the need to provide useful and timely information with the need to protect sensitive information			0
" " the old color coded system taught @entity23 to be scared , not prepared , " said ranking member rep. @entity54 , @entity55			1
" each and every time the threat level was raised , very rarely did the public know the reason , how to proceed , or for how long to be on alert			1
i have raised concerns for years about the effectiveness of the system and have cited the need for improvements and transparency			1
many in @entity70 felt the system was being used as a political scare tactic -- raising and lowering the threat levels when it best suited the @entity76 administration			1
" president @entity76 established the @entity2 by presidential directive on march 11 , 2002 , just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in @entity30 and @entity0			1
the five levels -- green for low , blue for guarded , yellow for elevated , orange for high and red for severe -- were intended to identify the risk of terrorist attack			0
the initial level was yellow , which the system retained until september 11 , 2002 , when it was raised to orange to cover the first anniversary of the attacks			1
it was lowered back to yellow on september 24			0
in its lifetime , the threat level has been raised to orange / high five times , although it went to that level three other times for specific industries			1
the threat level was raised to red / severe once -- on august 10 , 2006 , and only for commercial flights from the @entity100 to the @entity23 -- when @entity100 authorities announced they had disrupted a major plot to blow up aircraft			0
the level went down to orange on august 16 , 2006 , where it remains			0
the general threat level is yellow / elevated			0
the two lower levels have never been used , and task force looking at the system recommended in 2009 eliminating them altogether and making yellow the lowest threat level but renaming it " guarded			2
" almost from the start , the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies			2
the " @entity118 " went from green / low ( " wow , clean money systems really work " ) to red / severe ( " martial law , but it 's for your own good " )			0
a " @entity125 " began with " @entity122 is arrested " and ended with " @entity123 is elected president			0
" still another announced that @entity22 and @entity127 had jointly revised the system , changing green to aquamarine , blue to raw umber , yellow to burnt sienna , orange to neon carrot and red to cotton candy			2
the public did n't care much for the system either , with polls conducted at the time indicating most @entity23 found it confusing and not very useful			1
more seriously , however , some critics accused the @entity76 administration of using using the system to generate fear at politically sensitive times , such as just before the 2004 election			2
and just days after his 2005 resignation , then - @entity22 secretary @entity147 told a @entity0 forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the @entity153 , which made the decisions			1
the council included attorney general @entity156 , @entity158 chief @entity157 , @entity160 director @entity159 , defense secretary @entity161 and secretary of state @entity162			2
" more often than not we ( the department ) were the least inclined to raise it , " @entity147 told reporters after the forum			0
" sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment			0
sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good , you do n't necessarily put the country on ( alert )			0
... there were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it , and we said , ' for that ? ' " and in 2009 , @entity147 wrote in a tell - all book that sometimes officials such as @entity156 and @entity161 pressured the department to change the level , describing a 2004 event in which his arguments against raising the alert worked			2
" i believe our strong interventions had pulled the ' go - up ' advocates back from the brink			2
but i consider the episode to be not only a dramatic moment in @entity0 's recent history , but another illustration of the intersection of politics , fear , credibility and security , " he wrote			2
" after that episode , i knew i had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government , " he wrote			0
@entity147 announced his resignation on november 30 , 2004 , and left office on february 1 , 2005			0
the @entity76 administration denied @entity147 's assertions , however			0
" nobody 's more surprised than i am , " then - homeland security adviser @entity205 told @entity1 's @entity206			1
" of course , @entity147 never expressed those concerns while he was in the administration , nor did he when i spoke to him after he left ... ( @entity210 ) was n't the only one in that meeting who suggested the terror alert should n't be raised			0
at no time was there a discussion of politics in that meeting			0
and the president was made a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted -- not to raise the terror alert			0
" @entity205 is now a national security contributor for @entity1			2
@entity1 's @entity205 contributed to this report			0
