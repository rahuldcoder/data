@entity0 -- @entity0 has long been a destination for artistic dreamers from @entity4 : @entity5 moved to @entity6 from @entity7 in the 1940s to act			1
@entity10 - born @entity9 moved to @entity11 in the 1960s to direct			0
not to mention one ambitious actor named @entity14 , who arguably has done more to boost @entity11 's image as a place receptive to @entity17 than any tourism initiative the state might have dreamed up the past 30 years			2
but for accented aspiring pop stars from the @entity21 and beyond , @entity0 has n't generally been considered the place to launch an international music career			1
that honor fell to cities such as @entity26 and @entity27			0
these days @entity28 is getting the flyover treatment as singers from all over @entity4 and farther east set their sights on the @entity34 market via @entity6 as the new must - conquer gateway to @entity34 ears and eyes			1
artists such as @entity40 's @entity39 , @entity42 's @entity41 , @entity43 's @entity44 from @entity45 , @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity48 are suddenly swarming @entity0 with dreams of making it big			1
their presence is being felt at small clubs such as the @entity55 ( @entity44 played a solo show at the venue last year ) to red carpets ( @entity48 is now well known to @entity6 event photographers ) to purchased billboards on @entity61 ( @entity41 recently bought expensive outdoor media to promote himself along the busy , high visibility corridor )			1
" i love being here ... @entity0 is my second home now , " says @entity44 , who is working on her first solo record and now splits her time between @entity0 and @entity65			2
@entity44 and other singers from @entity45 and @entity4 's timing could n't be better : @entity34 has finally started to embrace the increasing globalization of pop music on a scale beyond the occasional super group ( see @entity72 ) or @entity74 one - hit wonder ( see @entity76 's " 99 @entity75 " ) thanks largely to websites such as @entity79 , which has leveled the playing field and cut out past gatekeepers such as @entity82			1
@entity84 singer @entity83 topped many critical lists in 2010 , with @entity88 's @entity87 set to make similar inroads in the @entity34 this year with early adopters in the pop and dance music arenas			1
but perhaps the most interesting singer ready to make the crossover in 2011 is @entity40 's @entity39			1
" when i first got here , someone told me ' there are no friends in the music business ' and i was so hurt , " the former winner of a @entity96 version of " @entity97 " said over coffee at a @entity6 restaurant last month			0
" but @entity0 is an amazing place to live once you find the people that inspire you , and i 've found that circle of friends here , " the singer said			2
" we make art together , and we constantly feed off each other			0
" the blonde beauty who looks like a glammed - out goth version of @entity118 ( though she and her fans loathe the comparison ) and sounds like a hybrid of @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 moved to @entity0 around four years ago and has been slowly winning over @entity34 fans ever since			1
her debut for @entity129 , 2008 's " @entity130 , " did fairly well for a new artist , considering @entity39 is pushing a sound she herself calls " @entity133			2
" according to @entity135 , around 65,000 copies were sold			0
however , both the singer and her label are thinking bigger this year after buzz surrounding her just - released " @entity139 " began heating up the internet			0
it 's too soon to tell if mainstream pop radio stations will embrace @entity39 in 2011 ( her follow - up full length record is expected to see a release by summer ) , but there are encouraging signs			1
@entity149 's popular @entity148 blog featured the singer late last year in a campaign worthy of a former " @entity97 " star ; rolling out her video for the released - in - december " @entity139 " with video diaries building up to a december 22 premiere			0
" it 's like @entity164 trash meets angels singing in a choir , " @entity39 said of " @entity139 , " which continues to draw interest online because of the video , which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals ( the clip was shot in @entity40 )			1
adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the @entity169 and other @entity17 countries , but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as @entity39 on the @entity34 pop charts			1
and while @entity17 artists who have " made it " overseas have been buying second homes in the @entity177 for decades , more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby , such as @entity47 's @entity46 , who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in @entity34 after a modicum of success elsewhere			1
the duo , who are identical twins , moved to @entity0 last year			0
they are currently working on their first record for @entity0 - based indie label @entity189 with known @entity34 producers including @entity192 , who has worked with names such as @entity194			2
" we love @entity0 because of the weather , nice people and shopping , but the main reason why we moved is our work , " @entity195 said via email last month			0
her twin sister @entity203 added the transition has not been easy			0
" it 's really hard to come from @entity4 and try to achieve success in @entity34			1
we are not native speakers , we are not @entity34 ... it 's a little disadvantage to us , but our big advantage is that we are twins			2
" @entity46 , which scored a minor @entity17 hit last year with a remake of @entity213 's 1980s hit " boys , " seem already savvy to the city 's sometimes cruel undercurrent			2
in their forthcoming single " @entity218 , " the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the @entity0			0
" the song is not about the perfect @entity6 , " @entity195 said , " it 's about people with their ' friendly faces ' which is far from being true			0
you should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust			0
@entity6 and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it			0
" sage advice from @entity0 ' latest émigrés , who sing on their soon - to - be released single : " welcome to @entity6 / boy you better give it up before it gets you down / welcome to @entity6 / just got to get a grip of how to get around			0

pop stars from all over @entity4 are setting their sights on the @entity34 market
@entity40 's @entity39 , @entity42 's @entity41 and @entity49 's @entity48 want to make it big in @entity0
@entity0 has long been a destination for @entity17 artists seeking fame
