@entity0 has raised its terror alert level to " high " for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003			1
according to the four - level system , a reading of " high " means a terrorist attack " is likely , " however the country 's prime minister @entity7 said no specific threat had been made			1
" this does not mean a terror attack is imminent , we have no specific intelligence of particular plots			1
what we do have is intelligence that there are people with the intent and capability to mount attacks , " @entity7 said at a press conference in @entity16 on friday			0
what does " high " mean ? @entity0 introduced its alert system in 2003 , with four levels of risk : low , medium , high and extreme			1
it 's been at " medium " since the system began , and is defined as meaning a " terrorist attack could occur			1
" the elevation to " high " would not make much difference to daily life for most people , the prime minister said			2
" what people would probably notice though is more security at airports , more security at ports , more security at military bases , more security at government buildings and more security at large public events , " he said			0
why now ? the decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director - general of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) earlier this week			2
@entity54 said the threat level had been building in @entity0 over the last year , due to the increasing influence of jihadists fighting for @entity58 in the @entity59 who had recruited @entity0 to fight			1
" they are of concern because , if they come home , they come home with training and with potentially increased intent , " he told the @entity61			0
officials believe there are at least 60 @entity0 fighting with terror group @entity58 , and as many as 100 " facilitators " still in the country			1
a number of arrest warrants have been issued for suspected terrorists fighting abroad , and police have swooped on a number of suspects in @entity0 , most recently arresting two men in @entity81 for allegedly recruiting and funding fighters sent to @entity83			2
alert levels elsewhere @entity0 's higher alert level follows an increase in the @entity87 , which raised its level from " substantial " to " severe " in late august			1
again , authorities said there was no intelligence to suggest an attack was imminent			2
however , hundreds of @entity87 citizens are believed to have joined jihadists abroad			0
notably , a hooded man with a @entity87 accent appeared to be the executioner of @entity100 journalists @entity98 and @entity101 on videos released by @entity58			0
the @entity100 replaced its color - coded warning system with the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) in 2011			0
@entity104 alerts are only issued if there 's " credible information about a threat			2
" and , alerts are classified as either " elevated " or " imminent			0
" @entity109 abandoned its color - coded alerts earlier this year , and instead now relies on a two - level " @entity112 " system			0
when more vigilance is needed , the triangle logo is displayed in public places			0
if there 's specific intelligence of an attack , the logo carries the words " alerte attentat " or " attack alert			1
" @entity122 : where is @entity58 in @entity124 ? @entity122 : where do jihadis come from ?			0

@entity0 increases terror alert level for first time in 11 years
the new rating of " high " means a terrorist attack " is likely "
however , @entity134 says no specific threat has been made
