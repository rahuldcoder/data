-- over the past year i 've revisited a host of @entity4 countries i first began traveling in more than a decade ago			0
the region 's progress has been remarkable both in terms of overall economic growth and the promising opening of formerly isolated nations like @entity11			1
with @entity15 's slowing growth and rising wages , investors and exporters are searching for new long - term opportunities and sites of production			2
the time of the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) has come			1
last month in @entity22 , i met a @entity24 - @entity22 couple with modest backgrounds who met while on fellowships in @entity27			0
after their respective graduate degrees , they reunited in @entity30 where they advise government agencies , donors and @entity34			0
their cross-border mobility is a symbol of an entire new generation of upwardly progressive @entity4 who view their success as intimately connected to the broader region rather than their smaller home nations alone			2
while much attention is paid to president @entity46 's articulation of a " @entity47 , " quietly an " @entity48 " is also being born			2
read more : @entity21 ' cornerstone ' of @entity27 's @entity4 diplomacy while obviously far from integrated in the ways the @entity51 is , @entity21 now has a momentum that @entity54 's regional project lacks			1
despite their historical differences and rivalries , @entity21 countries have been pushing forward rapidly with cross-border investments , commercial integration , and intra-regional trade that has kept them growing fast -- averaging more than 5 % -- even as the major export markets like @entity54 lose steam			1
with about 600 million people , @entity21 has only half of @entity67 's population but already a larger gdp			1
research firm @entity69 projects that @entity21 's gdp will reach $ 4.7 trillion in 2020 , not far off where @entity27 is today			1
strategic location @entity21 countries have strategic geography on their side as well			2
the region forms the crossroads of @entity15 and @entity67 , with deep infrastructural links re-emerging gradually through @entity11			2
it is also the main conduit , via the @entity80 , for most of the world 's oil flows between the @entity83 and @entity84			2
now is the time for @entity21 to move from size to coherence			2
over the past 50 years , @entity4 has experienced colonial liberation , the traumatic @entity89 , internal rivalries between @entity95 and @entity96 , various forms of strongman rule , and diplomatic self - isolation through non-alignment			0
today the region can be considered largely stable save for the simmering @entity99 dispute			0
this is @entity21 's chance to assert its collective voice , with @entity103 backing , vis - @entity104 - vis @entity15 and ensure that no single power dominates these crucial waters			1
the same applies to the issue of @entity15 's rampant upstream damming of the @entity109 , which threatens the stability of downstream flows on which @entity21 's heavily agricultural nations depend			1
read more : @entity21 chief : @entity15 risks becoming ' @entity4 's @entity114 ' continued economic integration is also a strategic imperative			1
@entity21 is expected to launch an @entity117 ( @entity118 ) by 2015 that can either boost the region 's growth potential or reveal deeper protectionist firewalls in both strong and weak economies			1
as much as @entity125 and @entity126 stand to gain from even greater access to @entity11 , @entity128 , and @entity22 , a community worth its name needs a vision to help develop its poorest members			0
the top priority both to promote integration and assist weaker @entity21 nations must be infrastructure investment			1
besides @entity135 , which has already become a first world city - state , only @entity125 and @entity96 have significantly invested in nationwide infrastructure			0
coupled with significant political and regulatory reforms , their second wave is under way			0
other major @entity21 countries such as @entity95 , @entity126 and the @entity143 are finally ramping up in terms of allocating greater shares of the national budget and overall gdp to infrastructure			1
crucial gateway far too often flooding and other mishaps take critical sectors of their economies offline			0
@entity95 is now focused on roads , @entity126 on railways , and the @entity143 on ports			0
if they execute on these critical projects , the current growth rates will be far more resilient in the years ahead			0
furthermore , with their high savings rates , dynamic private sectors , and growing interest from international markets , much more indigenous and foreign capital can be allocated towards public - private investment pools that can finance long - term infrastructure needs			1
we should remember that @entity21 's integration and development is as fundamentally a social as an economic or political issue			1
around the world , urbanization is bringing never - before - imagined opportunities to more than 50 million people per year who move into cities -- but it has also exacerbated inequality , fueling unrest from @entity177 to @entity178			0
for inclusive growth to occur , urbanization must be strategically conceived as a vehicle for employing -- and training -- tens of millions of youth in construction , hospitality , healthcare , education , and other services			0
furthermore , the large rural poor populations of @entity11 , @entity128 and @entity95 need the basic health and education systems , as well as more advanced agricultural equipment that open borders can bring			0
for decades @entity21 has been thought of as a second - tier regional body			2
now it has a chance to be the crucial gateway between powerful regions , a network of sustainable cities , and a thriving pillar of the century of @entity4 .			0

@entity21 economies have been growing at an average of more than 5 % , @entity203 says
with a shared population of just half @entity67 's , @entity21 already has a larger gdp , he says
research firm @entity69 projects that @entity21 's gdp will reach $ 4.7 trillion in 2020
@entity21 nations ' top priority must be infrastructure investment , @entity203 says
