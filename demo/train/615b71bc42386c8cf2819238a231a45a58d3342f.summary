@entity1 - painted elephants , bathing suit beauties and -- @entity4 ? it 's the sort of combination you can find only in @entity8			1
all three were present at the opening of the @entity10 in 1955			1
since then this @entity12 landmark has hosted @entity8 's and @entity14 's elite -- and its drama			1
" no grand hotel is a grand hotel without a touch of sleaze , " quips @entity16 of @entity17			1
" and the @entity21 has delivered			2
" from former sen. @entity23 , who was discovered there with his mistress , to @entity26 , the so - called @entity8 madam whose alleged prostitutes were caught in an undercover sting at the hotel , many public figures have stories that haunt the @entity21 's halls			2
but there 's a shiny side to the hotel as well			2
the @entity10 boasts more than 100 red carpet events each year , including the @entity36 , the @entity37 , the @entity34 nominees luncheon and the @entity39			1
" for a tourist coming in , it 's the buzz of that red carpet , " said hotel manager @entity40			2
" you do n't get to see that anywhere else			2
" of course , the drama and glitter are often connected			2
it was before music mogul @entity50 ' pre-grammy party in 2012 that @entity51 was found dead in her room at the @entity10			1
" in today 's world , when a lot of people think of the @entity10 , they think of @entity51 , " @entity53 said			1
" it has become a defining thing for ( the hotel )			2
" management stays away from discussing the hotel 's @entity8 travails			0
but like it or not , the @entity10 has hosted high drama for decades			1
" @entity65 was rumored to have had liaisons there , " @entity53 notes			0
" who knows how many were true and how many were false ? " ( there 's more evidence @entity65 conducted normal presidential business there			0
in fact , a photo of @entity65 at the @entity10 is hanging on the hotel wall			1
the president frequently arrived by helicopter , which a hotel spokesperson says landed on the roof of the hotel 's parking garage			0
) fellow politician @entity4 also delivered his famed " last press conference " at the hotel , after losing the race for @entity86 governor in 1962			0
with his political future in doubt , he told the press " you wo n't have @entity4 to kick around anymore			0
" @entity4 went on to become president , but " this turning point in ( his ) life -- and it could have been the end of his political career -- happened at the @entity10 , " @entity53 says			1
the @entity10 has n't always been a hip spot in @entity8			1
when @entity4 , then vice president , helped open the @entity10 , he declared it " magical			1
" but the luster and intrigue of the hotel had begun to wane by the time @entity104 bought the property in 1987			0
the former producer and talk show host poured money , and himself , into the hotel			0
with his @entity8 influence , the facade once again shined			0
" he made a big impact on the hotel with the entertainment world , " said @entity40			0
" he had his table by the pool ; he was out there every day and you never knew who was going to come have lunch with him			0
" today at the same pool , just days before the 72nd annual @entity39 , tourists wander around , hoping for a glimpse of a star			1
on this day it 's not meant to be ; only stagehands buzz around , readying the @entity128 for the awards telecast			0
but no one seems to mind because they 're staying at the @entity10			1
and when there are no actors around , the hotel itself -- and all its history -- easily plays the starring role			0
" @entity8 is a world most people do n't live in , " @entity40 notes			0
" if only for a moment , this is their chance to experience it			0
