-- more and more schools are jumping on the digital bandwagon and adopting @entity3 for daily use in the classroom			1
@entity7 's education - related announcements last week will no doubt bolster the trend , making faculty tools and student textbooks more engaging and accessible			1
but today another data point emerged , demonstrating that the @entity3 can be a valuable asset in education			1
in a partnership with @entity7 , textbook publishers @entity13 performed a pilot study using an @entity3 text for @entity18 1 courses , and found that 20 % more students ( 78 % compared to 59 % ) scored ' @entity20 ' or ' advanced ' in subject comprehension when using tablets rather than paper textbook counterparts			1
the study was conducted at a @entity26 , @entity27 , middle school from @entity28 to @entity29 using @entity13 's @entity30 : @entity32 pilot courses and @entity3 programs have cropped up all over the country , primarily in private and boarding schools , and select universities			1
in the public school sector , more than 600 school districts have adopted a 1:1 @entity3 program			1
the @entity3 seems to help students better connect with the content at hand			1
" students ' interaction with the device was more personal			2
you could tell students were more engaged , " said @entity46 , principal of @entity47			2
" using the @entity3 was more normal , more understandable for them			1
" tablets could be less daunting to students , too			0
@entity51 , ceo of digital - focused marketing agency @entity53 , says that moving textbooks to mobile devices will reinvent learning			0
" now you do n't know if a book is super huge and formidable , " @entity51 says			0
" learning can be done in snackable chunks			0
" another study centered on an @entity3 game , @entity64 , has shown that the @entity3 can help with fundamental math skills			1
fifth graders who regularly played the game for 20 minutes per day over a five - day period increased their test scores by 15 % on average ( you can check out more about this study on @entity0 's @entity72 )			1
digital textbooks have n't enjoyed the same success as app - based learning tools thus far , however			0
e-textbooks have been a transitional product , @entity77 analyst @entity76 wrote in a november 2011 report			0
they make up less than 3 percent of textbook sales , and do n't offer much over their paperbound counterparts			0
@entity7 's new and updated products — @entity88 ( an app - based hub for virtual classrooma ) , as well as ibooks 2 , the @entity86 and ibooks author — should help provide solutions for educators looking to provide more engaging experiences than plain , old pdfs , all without the heavy investments required of building apps from scratch			1
" with ibooks , learning will be a lot more experiential , " @entity51 told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
ibooks also have the potential to ease some of the financial burden of schools , as ebooks could save on textbook costs			0
" other benefits include more timely and relevant content , and the ability for students to interact and share this content with ease			1
textbooks will now become social in a variety of ways			0
" however , even if e-book prices themselves wo n't break the bank , @entity3 are still a $ 500 - plus investment per tablet			2
funding is still a problem , particularly for public schools			0
luckily , there are sites like @entity129 that can help offload the costs from teachers and school districts			0
and a program called @entity134 is helping to accelerate funding for technology resource requests on the site			0
thus far , @entity3 requests have been fairly low : @entity134 has funded 24 @entity3 - based project requests since nov. 25			2
currently there are 418 @entity3 - related requests on @entity129 , out of the 20,000 projects listed on the site			2
when the next @entity3 debuts , if @entity7 goes with a similar pricing scheme as it has with the @entity146 — as rumored — then schools will be able to pick up @entity3 on the cheap and really be able to utilize the company 's new education related products			1
but regardless , it looks like the @entity3 is starting to do an impressive job of improving the education space			2
and now that publishers and instructors have these ibooks tools at their disposal , students can continue to reap the benefits of increased understanding and greater participation			2
