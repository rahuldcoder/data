-- four new movies were no match for the feline phenom " @entity3 , " which ruled the box office for the second weekend in a row with $ 22.1 million , according to studio estimates			1
the 1994 @entity8 classic dropped only 27 percent -- an incredibly impressive hold considering this is the re-release of a 17 - year - old film that 's coming out on @entity12 in one week			2
the 3 - d version has now grossed $ 61.7 million , bringing " @entity3 " 's cumulative tally to $ 390.2 million			1
@entity8 says it plans to extend what was originally intended to be just a two - week release , although details are still being ironed out			0
the weekend 's runner - up was the new @entity20 baseball drama " @entity21 , " which batted a solid $ 20.6 million			1
if the estimate holds , that 'll represent the best opening ever for a baseball film , beating 2006â € ²s " the @entity27 " ( $ 19.7 million )			1
surprisingly for a sports movie , " @entity21 " drew a crowd that was evenly split between men and women , although it skewed quite older , with 89 percent of the audience at least 25 years old			1
both critics and moviegoers were fans -- the @entity38 film received some of the strongest reviews of the year and earned an " a " rating from @entity43 participants			0
" @entity21 " will now try to follow in the box - office footsteps of last year 's " @entity45 , " which debuted to a similar $ 22.4 million en route to a domestic total of $ 97 million			1
both movies were released by @entity49 in the middle of fall and were written by @entity52 ( who co-wrote " @entity21 " with @entity53 )			2
the two films even cost around the same amount to produce : $ 50 million for " @entity21 " and $ 40 million for " @entity45			1
" right behind " @entity21 " was the @entity38 - rated family drama " @entity57 " with $ 20.3 million			1
the @entity59 film joined " @entity63 " and " @entity64 " to become the year 's third release to score an " @entity62 " from @entity43 audiences			0
as a result , " @entity57 " is expected to hold up particularly well in the next few weeks and should easily earn back its $ 37 million budget			1
showings in @entity69 theaters accounted for 50 percent of the film 's opening			0
fourth place went to @entity75 's " abduction , " starring " @entity76 " 's @entity72 is his first solo lead role			0
the @entity38 action film debuted to a modest $ 11.2 million -- slightly below industry predictions			2
the $ 35 million movie received most of its business from young women , with 68 percent of the audience being female and 56 percent under than age of 25			2
abduction garnered a lackluster " b - " rating from @entity43 moviegoers , though women under the age of 18 were more generous with an " a- " grade			0
and according to @entity43 , 56 percent of ticket buyers listed @entity72 as their main reason for attending the movie			0
so the 19 - year - old actor does have box - office potential , but it 's currently limited to teenage girls			0
finally , in fifth was the r - rated thriller " @entity98 , " which snagged a disappointing $ 9.5 million			2
the $ 66 million movie , starring @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 , is the first picture to be released by @entity105 , a partnership between the @entity108 and @entity109 theater chains			2
but despite its buzz - worthy cast , the film could n't match the $ 11.4 million debut of @entity101 's last live - action project , january 's " @entity113			1
" @entity43 graders handed " @entity98 " a so - so " b " rating			0
in limited release , the action biopic " @entity118 " -- starring @entity119 as real - life biker - turned - defender - of - @entity124 - orphans @entity122 -- underwhelmed with $ 44,000 at four theaters			0
and " puncture , " featuring @entity127 as a drug - addicted lawyer , also disappointed , grossing $ 35,700 from four locations			0
@entity3 -- $ 22.1 mil 2			1
moneyball -- $ 20.6 mil 3			1
@entity57 -- $ 20.3 mil 4			1
abduction -- $ 11.2 mil 5			0
