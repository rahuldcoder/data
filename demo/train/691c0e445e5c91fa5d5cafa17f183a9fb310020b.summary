-- my heart aches for the children , parents and teachers at @entity6			1
like them , i know what it means to have life turned on its head by unprecedented violence			1
on the morning of april 20 , 1999 , two senior students walked into @entity14 and began a shooting spree			1
someone pulled the fire alarm and i was able to escape my trigonometry classroom			2
while i did n't suffer any injury , people i knew and admired were killed			1
that awful day left a permanent scar on our community in @entity24 , @entity25			2
but the @entity14 shooting did not define us			1
we are defined by the acts of goodness that followed			2
people in our community bonded and helped each other get through the tragedy			0
hundreds of comfort quilts were sewed and handed out to those who were trying to recover from the anguish and pain			1
restaurants provided free meals in the days after the shooting			1
strangers offered hugs to each other at the @entity41 for support			0
no one ever should experience a @entity14 moment			1
no one wants to feel assaulted , offended or hurt by an inexplicable event			0
but sometimes , those things happen			0
the way we respond to those moments is crucial in how we build and rebuild our relationships , and more importantly , how we rebuild our lives			0
there are two ways we can respond to a traumatic experience -- as a victim or a survivor			0
early on , i pitifully used @entity14 to justify personal failures and shortcomings			1
eventually , i realized that i owned the way i reacted to situations and how i engaged with those around me			0
more than a decade later , i still think about @entity14			1
i do not dwell on the grotesque details of the day			0
in quiet meditation , i think of the lives that were taken and the lessons that help me move forward			0
i appreciate the subtle and profound consequences that our thoughts and actions can have on others			0
i became slower to anger and quicker to love			2
the inconsiderate driver or long line at the post office does n't spoil my day anymore			2
i share my story to offer hope to those impacted by violence -- those who wonder whether they 'll be able to regain the life they once knew			1
the answer is no. life wo n't be the same			1
but one can , over time , find happiness			0
when you are able to come out of a tragedy you 'll be stronger with a greater capacity to love , more determination to serve others and desire to mend broken family ties			0
and you 'll feel joy that comes from these actions			0
to those who are wading through a mountain of pain and sorrow right now , please know that it will be ok			2
take time to grieve your loss			0
talk through your feelings , even if it 's no more than ramblings			2
live your life in a way that honors the memory of the precious lives that were taken			2
push out the anger and fill your mind with a positive outlook			1
i promise this approach will bring more peace and joy			0
there may be some people who are angry at @entity121			0
in @entity14 's aftermath , my faith was an essential part of my healing process			1
there 's a scripture passage that i take comfort in : @entity129 can not behold with your natural eyes , the design of your @entity121 concerning those things which shall follow after much tribulation			2
for after much tribulation come the blessings			0
i believe in @entity121 and trust that he has a plan for our lives			0
his added measure of strength always comes at the moment when we 've exhausted our best effort			0
when tragedies like @entity14 or @entity145 happen , we are reminded of the fragility and precious nature of life			1
this gives rise to the question , what will you do with the time you have ? choose faith , choose charity , choose hope			1
then , life will be livable again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			1
