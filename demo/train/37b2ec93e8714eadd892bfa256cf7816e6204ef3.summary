-- @entity1 has the weight of a nation on his shoulders at @entity5 , but the world 's most expensive footballer is struggling to make an impact for @entity9			1
mocked by opposing fans after uncharacteristic misses against @entity12 , the man who seemingly scores at will for @entity15 is under extreme pressure ahead of sunday 's final group b clash with the @entity18			1
the @entity19 need to win by two goals to have any chance of reaching the quarterfinals , while 2004 runners - up @entity9 could go through with a draw if @entity12 can not beat leaders @entity26			1
@entity1 scored 46 goals in 38 league games as @entity15 wrested the @entity30 title off @entity31 last season , but @entity12 fans chanted the name of @entity35 -- his rival for the title of world 's best player -- in @entity9 's last - gasp 3 - 2 victory on wednesday			1
however , former @entity9 goalkeeper @entity41 told @entity0 that @entity1 does not deserve the criticism he has received for his performances so far			1
" @entity1 is a fantastic player and is our captain and is doing very well , " said @entity41 , who won 80 international caps and played at two @entity45 and the 2002 @entity46			1
" he 's working , he 's helping the team			2
okay we are always expecting @entity1 can win the game alone , but sometimes it is not possible			1
" now he 's playing for the team , that is very important			2
when he can not make the difference , he helps the team			0
that 's what a captain has to do in this situation			0
" @entity9 's defensive approach under coach @entity61 has mystified football pundits and fans alike , especially given the glimpses of the team 's undoubted attacking skills in the final 20 minutes of the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity26			1
@entity41 expects similar tactics in the match in @entity70			0
" we will play on the counterattack because it 's the way we played in the other two matches			2
it will be the same because @entity18 has to win this game , " he said			1
" we did not start so well against @entity26 with a defensive strategy -- we have so much quality in our players to play in that way			2
but in the second game , we played better -- not the way we like it			0
" we played better until 2 - 2 and then we suffered a little bit , but at the end we scored a third goal and now we are in a fantastic position to go to the next round because this is a very tough group , it 's the most difficult group in this @entity91			2
" it has been called the " @entity95 " -- and the @entity18 are fighting for their lives after two successive defeats			1
the 2010 @entity46 finalists suffered a shock 1 - 0 loss to @entity12 , and then were dominated in the first half by @entity26 before losing 2 - 1 as star names such as @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 failed to combine their undoubted talents			1
former international @entity105 remains hopeful that the 1988 champions can continue their record of reaching the last eight in their last six appearances at the tournament			0
" two - nil to @entity18 -- i 'm still confident ! it 's going to be really , really tough			2
@entity9 needs to win , @entity18 needs to win ... @entity12 needs to win -- it 's still a group where anything can happen , " he said			1
@entity105 , who helped the " @entity18 " reach the semifinals of @entity116 and 2004 , said coach @entity117 might make changes against @entity9			1
" the manager has n't changed much over the last years , he always tries to play with two central holding midfielders and let the other four play in front of them and go forward , " the 35 - year - old said			0
" there 's been a lot of talk in the press that maybe he should play just one holding midfielder and put maybe @entity131 back in the team to get some more drive forward			0
" the big shout is for @entity134 , who is the top goalscorer in the @entity135 , for him to play up front and maybe find a different position for @entity138 , so maybe that 's what will happen			0
" he made a big point by substituting ( captain and the coach 's son - in - law ) @entity144 the other day at halftime			0
@entity146 got dragged off , it 's all signals that there has to be a change when playing against @entity9			2
" @entity151 has been in charge since 2008 , and last year extended his contract until @entity154 , but @entity105 suggested that the 60 - year - old might not last that long if the @entity19 crash out early			0
" the @entity19 @entity157 came out and said even if they do n't qualify he 'll keep his job			0
we know that @entity151 signed a new deal with a clause in there ( saying ) when he finds a top team in @entity165 he can leave , " @entity105 said			0
" well maybe he put that in for himself			0
maybe if it does n't work out at the @entity168 , with mutual consent you can say , ' well , if you find a nice club you can do it this way , ' and he might say goodbye			0
