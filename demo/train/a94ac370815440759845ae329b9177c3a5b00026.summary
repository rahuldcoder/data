-- do comedy writers share notes or do they just think alike ? on the day " @entity6 " host @entity5 announced he was passing the baton to @entity8 , he and an old rival shared nearly identical jokes on their late night shows			1
in his opening monologue on wednesday , @entity5 said it had been a tough day for him			1
" had a really awkward day today , " the late night host said in mock anguish			0
" had to call @entity15 and tell him he did n't get ' @entity6 ' ... again			1
" at nearly the same instant on the " @entity17 , " @entity15 addressed his rival 's impending retirement			0
" i got a call from my mom today , she says , ' well , @entity15 , i see you did n't get the ' @entity6 ' again , ' " @entity15 said with a shrug			1
" what are you going to do , mom ? " he asked			0
a bit of comedy serendipity ? maybe it was just too tempting to pass up			0
many expected @entity15 would take over " @entity6 " when former host @entity31 retired in 1992 , but the gig instead went to @entity5			1
@entity15 jumped networks to start " @entity17 " on @entity34 , which airs opposite @entity5 on @entity35			2
how @entity36 helped @entity37 get @entity5 's job emotional @entity37 @entity37 bounded onto his " @entity44 " set , full of energy , if a bit manic , after word of his new job			1
" hello ! welcome ! this is ' @entity44 with @entity8 , ' for now , " he said to chuckles			0
" you guys probably heard the news -- i 'm going to be taking over ' @entity6 ' next february ! " but do n't worry , until february , our focus is right here on whatever this show is called			1
" later , @entity37 's voice cracked as he paused and struggled for words at times			2
" i want to thank everyone here at ' @entity44			0
' the staff , the crew and , of course , @entity64 , " he said , referring to his late night band			0
" i have to say thanks to @entity5 for being so gracious			2
it means so much to me to have his support			0
" an hour earlier , @entity5 congratulated @entity37 in his opening monologue , while taking another swipe at the @entity35 executives that are showing him the door			1
" i just have one request of @entity8			0
we 've all fought , kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place , okay ? now we have to keep it there , " he deadpanned			0
" @entity8 do n't let it slip into sixth			0
we 're counting on you			0
" @entity5 will wrap up his 22 - year run as host in spring 2014 , with @entity37 officially signing on as his replacement			1
on his @entity36 account , @entity37 said , " today was one of the most exciting days of my life			2
" rumors have been swirling the expectation that @entity5 would leave @entity35 's legendary late - night program has been building recently , and @entity37 's appointment is n't surprising in the least			1
he 's had a swift rise to " tonight 's " chair , having hosted " @entity44 " for just four years , but @entity37 's transition was treated as such a near certainty that both hosts worked the headlines into their nightly routines			2
while @entity37 initially downplayed the rumors , @entity5 went after his employer on a regular basis			1
he compared @entity35 executives to snakes , joked about the network 's sagging ratings and kidded that the rumored late - night shuffle was like @entity35 's version of @entity109			0
monologue : @entity5 congratulates @entity37 just two days before the big announcement , @entity37 and @entity5 again made light of the reports with a parody of the song " tonight " from the musical " @entity116			1
" with @entity5 's contract set to expire in fall 2014 , industry observers said the move was only a matter of time			1
and this , says media reporter @entity122 , was the right time			1
" @entity5 told me that really the difference with this was he went along with it , " said @entity122 , a @entity124 reporter who wrote " @entity125 : when @entity129 and @entity130 went @entity131 " -- a book that chronicles the last time @entity5 left " tonight			1
" " he agrees with this			0
he 's on board with this			0
" this has happened before @entity5 first exited " tonight " in 2009 after 17 years as host , passing the torch to @entity139 , who was then the host of " @entity44			1
" @entity5 was moved to prime time with his own program , " the @entity143 , " that fall			2
but when that brought dismal ratings , @entity35 decided to put @entity5 back in charge of " tonight " at the start of 2010 , leaving @entity139 without a job			2
despite his short stint on " tonight , " @entity139 wished @entity37 well			2
" i want to congratulate @entity8			0
that is a really fun gig			0
you laugh , but it really is , " @entity139 said , trying to reassure the audience he was n't being sarcastic			0
" @entity8 is the perfect guy to do it			0
he 's going to do a fantastic job			0
" after getting the boot from " tonight , " the flame - haired comedian eventually moved to @entity159 to host his own show , " @entity161 , " in the 11 p.m. hour , but the entire scenario generated ill will toward @entity5 and @entity35			1
( @entity159 shares a parent company with @entity0			0
) yet as the years went on , @entity5 has proved to be resilient			2
as @entity35 's prime - time ratings suffered , @entity5 's " @entity6 " was still able to rise above the rest in its time slot			1
at the end of march , " @entity6 " hit a seven - week high in total viewers , with 3.52 million watching			2
however , @entity35 was said to be concerned about losing younger viewers to @entity172 's @entity171 , whose " @entity174 " was moved up to compete with @entity5 and @entity15 's " @entity17 " at the beginning of 2013			2
" the more time @entity171 is in that slot , the more the young audience goes that way , the harder it is for ( @entity37 ) to keep that audience , " one source familiar with the network 's thought process told @entity178 in march			2
changing states of comedy with the change in hosts comes a change in locales			0
according to a statement from @entity35 , " as part of the transition , ' @entity6 ' will be returning to its original home in @entity194 in @entity195 " from @entity5 's base of @entity198			1
@entity195 gov. @entity199 praised the move , saying in a statement " on behalf of all @entity195 " that he 's " pleased to welcome ' @entity6 ' back to its first home			1
" when it began in 1954 , the " original ' @entity6 ' ushered in the modern era of television , " @entity199 continued			2
" it is only fitting that as ' @entity6 ' returns to our state , it will be headlined by @entity195 's own native son and resident , @entity8			1
" out with the old at 62 years old , @entity5 represents a more traditional form of hosting , as he 's known for his " @entity217 - style comedy , " said @entity124			1
@entity37 , 38 , regularly incorporates the @entity218 and social media into his act , offering " a more contemporary and varied brand of entertainment , " the @entity124 said			1
this changing of the guard is one of the most closely watched exercises in pop culture , especially as it takes place at one of tv 's mainstay productions			0
even with its decline in ratings over the years , it remains a solid profit center for @entity35 , making between $ 25 million and $ 40 million for the network , according to the @entity124			2
although it 's been on the air for almost 60 years , " @entity6 " has had just a handful of regular hosts : @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity31 , @entity5 and @entity139			1
" @entity6 " is n't what it was during the long tenure of @entity31 , who hosted the show from 1962 until 1992			1
in those three - network times , @entity31 dominated late - night tv like nobody before or since			0
he dominated the ratings and routinely sat down challengers like so many duck targets at a carnival shooting gallery			0
@entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 -- they all tried to dethrone the king , and they all came up short			0
@entity31 sat behind " tonight 's " desk for 30 years before passing the torch to @entity5 , and " @entity31 " is still the model against whom all are measured			0
" @entity44 " producer @entity267 , who 's now executive producer of " @entity6 , " has called @entity37 " the closest thing " this generation has to @entity31			1
it appears it 's now time for @entity37 to show and prove			1
@entity0 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
