@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's journey from congressman to vice-presidential candidate was cloaked in secrecy worthy of a big - screen thriller			1
in the culminating scene , @entity4 -- policy wonk , statistics nerd , father of three -- crept through the woods behind his @entity14 home for a clandestine pickup by a top aide friday afternoon			1
for @entity4 , who days earlier had agreed to become the running mate of presumptive @entity20 presidential nominee @entity19 , it was only the latest episode in an elaborate campaign undertaking designed to escape detection before the candidate 's formal announcement in @entity26 , @entity27 , on saturday			1
bold vp pick could woo key voters @entity32 aide @entity31 ran the former @entity35 governor 's four - month vice-presidential search and played a key role in the cloak - and - dagger aspect of those final days			1
she briefed reporters on the entire process saturday afternoon			0
the search began in early april with a large group of potential picks			0
throughout the process , @entity31 and @entity19 were compulsively careful to prevent any information from leaking to the press			1
as the months progressed and the research documents on each possible name grew -- including " several years " of tax returns that each potential candidate submitted , @entity31 said -- all the paperwork was stored overnight in a safe in a secure room at the campaign headquarters in @entity52			1
no copies were made of the material , and all work on the vice-presidential effort was done in that room			0
four months later , after consulting with " a lot " of other people and a final " gut check " with his top advisers , @entity19 decided @entity4 was his choice , @entity31 said			1
that day , august 1 , the presumptive @entity20 nominee placed a call to @entity4 from @entity31 ' office in the campaign headquarters requesting a meeting			1
the next day , @entity19 called a man many considered to be at the top of his vice-presidential list , former @entity71 gov. @entity70 , to inform his former rival he had not been chosen			1
@entity19 called the others on his short list the day before his announcement			2
on sunday , august 5 , the campaign initiated an array of evasive maneuvers			0
" we gave a lot of thought on how to make this work undetected , " @entity31 told reporters in a briefing at @entity81 in @entity82 on saturday			2
@entity19 's choice of @entity4 changes the race a major figure in the effort : @entity31 ' 19 - year - old son @entity91 , who was designated to chauffeur @entity4 to and from the airport for his meeting with @entity19			1
@entity4 caught a flight from @entity95 to @entity96 , @entity97 , on sunday			2
the campaign asked him to dress casually , @entity31 said			2
" @entity4 was wearing jeans , a casual shirt , baseball hat and sunglasses and passed unnoticed through both airports , " she said			0
@entity104 drove @entity4 to his family 's home in @entity107 , @entity35			0
@entity19 came down from his @entity109 summer home , and the two men met for about an hour in the @entity112 ' dining room			0
how @entity4 could help @entity19 " it was a little longer than an hour , actually , " @entity19 said			1
" oh , we talked about the campaign and how it would be run and talked about how we 'd work together if we get the @entity117 -- what the relations would be , how we 'd interact and be involved in important decisions			0
but we talked about our families -- what this meant for them , what kind of challenge it meant -- those are the topics we discussed			0
" when the two left the dining room , " it was all set , " @entity31 said			0
then , after @entity19 had left , @entity4 received word of the deadly rampage at a @entity134 temple in his @entity14 district			1
he spoke with his aides about the crisis while at @entity31 ' home , and returned home to @entity14 unnoticed			0
later in the week , a memorial service for the victims of the shooting prompted the campaign to change its planned announcement			2
@entity31 said the vice-presidential event was originally slated for friday in @entity109 , but that date conflicted with the service			0
so the campaign settled on @entity26 , the first city @entity19 would visit on his upcoming bus tour			2
@entity4 through the years which brings the saga back to the wooded area behind @entity4 's home			0
after he returned from the memorial service on friday , @entity4 walked in his front door , through the house and out the back , through the woods , and ended up at the driveway of the house where , coincidentally , he had grown up			0
" it was n't that far of a walk , " @entity4 laughed in a conversation with reporters on a campaign charter from @entity82 to @entity1 on saturday			2
" i just went out my back door , went through the gully in the woods i grew up playing in			0
i walked past the fort i built back there			0
" the @entity4 aide who had dropped him off in front of his home then picked @entity4 up at the driveway of the other home and drove an hour to a small plane chartered by the campaign at the airport in @entity178 , @entity179 , where @entity4 met his family			1
they flew to another tiny airport , in @entity183 , @entity1 , where @entity104 was again waiting to play a role in the drama			0
he drove the family to the @entity187 in @entity183 , where @entity31 and several other @entity19 advisers huddled with @entity4			1
@entity104 picked up food from @entity190 's for the group , and @entity31 said : " everyone was pretty tired so we did a little speech prep and went to bed			2
" the next morning a member of the @entity197 met the two - vehicle caravan , and @entity4 was driven to the @entity19 announcement event in @entity26			1
at the end of that day , @entity4 was still reeling to take in the life - changing experience			2
" it 's gone from the surreal to the real , i guess , " he said @entity4 economics : 5 things to know @entity19 , @entity4 to campaign ' on different tracks ' until convention @entity209 : @entity4 a ' right wing ideologue '			1

@entity4 took secret trip to meet with @entity19 before he was picked
*longtime* aide @entity31 worked with @entity19 to prevent leaks to media
all the candidates ' records were kept in a safe in campaign @entity220
@entity223 for victims of @entity134 temple shooting delayed *rollout* by a day
