-- a day after reports that @entity4 plans to announce a follow up to its popular @entity6 smartphone in february , the @entity2 company has taken to @entity7 to deny them			1
the @entity9 , a new iteration of the phone that has established itself as the chief rival to @entity13 's @entity12 , will be introduced in february at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , according to @entity17			1
a day after that report surfaced , though , @entity4 took to its @entity2 @entity7 account to deny it			1
" please note that some media reported speculation that the @entity24 's subsequent models will be released , " the tweet read in @entity2 , calling the report " a simple rumor [ that ] is not true			1
" the report from the @entity17 , the oldest english - language newspaper in @entity2 , cites unnamed company officials and parts suppliers in the region			2
among the @entity9 's features will be a 5 - inch screen , slightly larger than the display on the popular @entity6 and a full inch bigger than the @entity12 , the report said			1
it will have more powerful hardware and software and will " definitely use " @entity41 networks , a parts supplier told the paper			1
the perils of sleeping with your mobile phone phones running @entity48 's @entity47 operating system have been outselling the @entity12 for some time			1
but that 's a fragmented field that includes dozens of phones of varying quality			0
no single handset has established itself as a serious rival to @entity13 's phone			1
the @entity6 has made perhaps the best claim			2
last month , the company announced it had sold more than 20 million units in three months , making september the first month since the release of the @entity59 that it was n't the world 's top - selling smartphone			2
snap reviews of the @entity12 have been somewhat mixed , at least among the tech media			0
many who got a hands - on demo at @entity13 's wednesday announcement praised its slimmer , lighter design , bigger display and faster processor			0
others said the device failed to produce groundbreaking advances at a moment when @entity13 , perhaps for the first time ever , finds itself needing to catch up with features available on other phones			0
customer response , however , has been overwhelming			0
pre-orders of the @entity12 5 " sold out " almost instantly ( an admittedly arbitrary feat considering @entity13 controls the supply ) , with orders topping 2 million in the first 24 hours			1
that 's double the 1 million for last year 's @entity59 in the same time period			0
the phone hits stores friday in the @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and the @entity96			0
it rolls out in 22 other countries on september 28			0
the @entity9 's release would mark @entity4 's biggest salvo since a federal court in @entity102 ruled that @entity4 violated multiple @entity13 patents in the release of its own products			1
after the ruling , @entity13 asked the court to add the @entity6 to the list of products that are in violation			0
the case was just one of roughly 50 patent disputes in different countries			0
some of the other courts have ruled in favor of @entity4			0
according to the @entity2 news report , @entity4 is working with @entity88 carriers on modified designs the company said will eliminate any questions about patents			1
the report said @entity4 plans to fire back in another way , too			2
@entity4 is asking @entity13 to pay more for the processors it produces at an @entity129 , @entity128 , plant and is promoting itself as " the only firm that can guarantee on - time delivery , output commitment and better pricing for mobile application processors , " one executive told @entity17			2
