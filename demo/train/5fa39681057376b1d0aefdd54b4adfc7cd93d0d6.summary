@entity0 , @entity1 -- polls closed sunday in @entity1 where citizens voted in an election overshadowed by violence as protesters demand the elderly president refrain from seeking another term			1
president @entity10 , 85 , was booed and jeered when he cast his ballot at a polling station in the middle - class neighborhood of @entity14 did not address the crowd , looked visibly frustrated at one point , and made some sort of gesture to the crowd , which also included some of his supporters			1
if a candidate does not win 50 % of the vote , a runoff election will be held next month in the @entity27 nation			1
" we 've had enough of this regime of thieves and assassins			2
we will defeat them here , " said @entity32 , a voter at the @entity34 station			2
as the president arrived , he and other chanted " @entity37 , " which means " step down " in @entity1 's predominant @entity39 language			2
@entity1 is one of the continent 's most stable democracies			0

turnout on sunday was low , according to @entity53 , chief observer of the @entity55 monitoring mission			1
" early in the morning , you saw long queues of people in front of polling stations but , later in the day , there were much less people and it seems that the turnout is below 50 % , " he said			1
" there was high political tension before these elections , so it is surprising that so few people came to vote			2
" @entity10 is seeking re-election despite deadly demonstrations after the country 's highest court cleared him to seek a third term			1
protests have occurred in @entity1 since the @entity76 's january 27 ruling			0
opposition demonstrators argue that the court was compromised and the constitution limits presidents to two terms			2
the incumbent successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place			0
the president , who has been in office since 2000 , was once hailed as a visionary , but his popularity has plummeted			2

... there are increasing levels of poverty , inequality , lack of jobs and an increasing numbers of disillusioned youth			0
" @entity10 ran against 13 other candidates on sunday 's ballot			1
" @entity1 is at a crossroad			0
a people whose patience has run out , a leader who 's out of touch , a constitution not reflective of popular sentiments and an opposition that is unable to put aside party differences with a common purpose to defeat @entity10 , " @entity90 said			1
protesters calling for his ouster have clashed on the streets , with at least three people killed during demonstrations last weekend , an opposition leader said			0
at least two others died in previous clashes			0
a presidential spokesman has accused opposition candidates and their supporters of fueling " urban guerrilla warfare " leading up to sunday 's vote			1
but @entity129 , head of the opposition june 23 movement , blamed police for the escalating violence , saying they were responsible for some deaths during demonstrations in @entity0 and @entity136 this month			1
the presidential spokesman denied the police or military were involved in the deaths			0
the opposition june 23 movement , or @entity143 , is named after the date of protests last summer that forced @entity10 to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would have nearly guaranteed his victory in this month 's election			1
