-- @entity1 lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44			1
his death left her to raise a young child alone			1
for 16 years , she stayed single because , " going through it once was enough for me			1
" when she met @entity9 , he weighed around 300 pounds but was in pretty good physical shape			1
yet over time , she watched as the former football player started taking pills for his high cholesterol and high blood pressure , more for anxiety and gout , and insulin shots for his type 2 diabetes			1
" his girth got bigger , as did his neck , which caused sleep apnea , " she remembers			1
after the @entity23 couple got married , she found herself buying him bigger and bigger clothes			1
when her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery , or weight - loss surgery , would be covered under the couple 's plan , she told her husband about it			1
" i knew he had to do something , but i was n't sure he was ready for something so drastic , " she says			1
the doctor had flat - out told @entity1 : " lose weight or die			1
" he was tired of taking so many medications and not having enough energy to simply live life			2
" one day ... you find out that you 're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it , " he says			2
there are several types of bariatric surgery			1
with gastric bypass , a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines			2
another type involves placing an adjustable band around the upper portion of the stomach			1
the device can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor 's visits			2
it can help patients feel fuller faster and eat less			2
unlike gastric bypass , adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed			2
@entity1 decided to do the gastric bypass surgery			1
although doctors are n't sure why , studies have shown gastric bypass puts type 2 diabetes into remission in most obese patients			1
@entity9 also did n't want to have the option of reversing the surgery			1
" in the back of your mind you can always take the band off , " he says of the lap - band procedure			2
" i did n't want to be able to go back			2
" getting approved for the surgery was more difficult than he expected			1
many people who have bariatric surgery gain the weight back , so insurance companies are often wary of paying for the procedure			1
@entity1 saw his primary care physician , a nutritionist , a cardiologist , a pulmonologist , a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist -- all of whom had to sign off			1
the psychiatrist told @entity1 he rejected upward of half his patients because they were n't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery			1
@entity1 admitted that 10 years ago he would n't have been ready either			1
" i 'm from @entity103 , " he says			1
" i enjoyed my beer , brats and cheese too much			2
" but kids and grandkids " changes things			2
he eventually got the go - ahead			2
the day of his surgery , his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck			1
" i tried to dissuade ( him ) from having it			2
what if they made a wrong cut ? what if he did n't wake up ? what if he had a heart attack on the table ? " the surgery was a success , but he was far from the ideal patient			1
shortly after surgery he ate a popsicle too fast and starting throwing up			1
when he got home , he continued his trial - and - error period , getting sick as he learned his limits			2
" imagine after you eat your big @entity135 dinner -- times 10 , " he says of overeating with his smaller stomach			2
" and you ca n't do anything about it			2
you 're just so miserable and it 's either got to come up or go out			2
" he started out on a liquid diet , then pureed his food			2
" we did n't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable , " @entity1 says			1
" i started hiding out to eat because i felt guilty			0
" it was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again , @entity1 says			1
he realized that meat -- steak , chicken , turkey -- was too tough for his stomach to handle			0
but popcorn went down easily			0
he developed 10 rules for himself , and other bariatric patients , and the weight began to fall off			1
in six months , he had lost more than 125 pounds			1
the hardest thing for him was filling time			0
he had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food			0
he now smokes a cigar instead of eating a bag of chips , or plans a big weekend getaway to celebrate a work success			0
he orders an appetizer instead of an entree when he goes out to play cards with friends during the week			0
his daily diet routinely consists of @entity175 yogurt , protein bars , soup , popcorn , cheese and crackers			0
he does n't eat large meals , just smaller portions whenever he 's hungry			0
in some ways , his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to fit his			0
it has n't been easy , the couple says , but it has been worth it			0
" i 'm 57 going on 37 , " @entity1 says with a laugh			1
" no pun intended -- i 'm like a kid in a candy store			1
" he plans to attend his 40th high school reunion in june with pride : " i know i 'll be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that reunion than they did in high school			0
" more importantly , " i will have my husband and best friend around for a long time , " his wife says			0

2 ) @entity210 of foods and liquids will be necessary , but painful			1

@entity217 : keep your anti-nausea pills close by -- you will definitely need them in the beginning			0
3 ) find a high - protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day			0
( @entity224 was @entity175 yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry , banana and chocolate protein			0
) also , stay true to your vitamin regimen , especially vitamin @entity232 , vitamin d and calcium			0
4 ) concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day , plus snacks , to five to six small meals			0
5 ) stay hydrated ! it 's very important that you avoid getting dehydrated , so avoid intake of caffeine , carbonated sodas , beer and alcohol			0

start out walking 30 minutes , four to five days a week			0
build up to walking farther and faster , and more often , while adding weight lifting two to three days per week			0
you will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine , plus your dog will love it even more than you ! 7 ) start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food			0
reward yourself by going to see a favorite performer if you hit a weight loss goal			0
join a card club , start reading again , or make a movie date with your significant other each week			0

8 ) it 's ok to leave food on your plate ! regardless of what your mother said growing up , children in @entity269 , @entity270 or @entity271 are n't going to be affected if you leave food on your plate when eating at home or away			0
people will ask why , but trust me , you wo n't be hurting their feelings if you just say you 're full			0
9 ) order an appetizer as your main meal when eating out			0
you will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you			0
10 ) and last , but definitely not least , welcome and embrace your support network , be it a wife , friend , business colleague , etc. you will have good days and a few bad ones and the unconditional love and support these people will show you will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good ! have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity293			0
