-- the @entity1 has a dignity problem			2
the concept of dignity is recognized by law in countries all over the world			2
it is a cornerstone of both international humanitarian law , which governs the treatment of prisoners of war , and international human rights law			2
but it has little power in @entity16 jurisprudence			0
a robust recognition and protection of dignity is precisely what we need , particularly if we are to understand how racism has broken its tether and become enshrined again in state laws and policies across the @entity1			1
take racial profiling -- the single most explicit manifestation of racial prejudice in the @entity1 today			1
nearly 700,000 individuals a year are subject to the brutal indignity of the @entity32 's stop - and - frisk policy			1
the vast majority are young african - american and @entity36 men			2
in a @entity37 op - ed in december , 23 - year - old @entity40 heart - rendingly described his initiation into the world of stop - and - frisk beginning at age 14			1
this rite of passage for innocent young black men requires submitting without complaint or question to being harassed and targeted by the police			0
even showing an " attitude " can escalate encounters into an arrest or even death			0
stop - and - frisk policing is only one aspect of the national indignity of racial profiling			1
police surveillance of law - abiding @entity63 ( here again the @entity60 police play a central role ) and the pulling over of motorists for " driving while black " are two others			1
rather than recognize how these practices strike at our bedrock constitutional rights to due process , equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches , the @entity68 recently doubled down on racial profiling			1
it decided that the discretion of police may be complemented by the discretion of jail officials to strip - search the 14 million @entity1 who are arrested each year			2
in this way , the conservative majority on the court is turning back the clock on the greatest successes of the civil rights movement -- the understanding that the @entity90 amendments to the @entity91 were designed to uphold the inherent dignity of blacks as human beings and citizens			0
even more alarming and insidious is the court 's ability to provide legal support for racial profiling without ever mentioning race			1
in key , high - profile cases in which racial profiling was either explicitly or implicitly at the core of the complaint , the conservative majority simply ignores the racial implications of sweeping decisions that leave racial minorities subject to arbitrary law enforcement practices			1
opinion : a jury 's race can deny justice in 2010 in @entity116 , a case brought by a @entity118 man who argued that racial and religious profiling after 9/11 resulted in his arrest and mistreatment in jail in @entity60 , the court raised the standard for complainants in civil cases			1
it insisted that plaintiffs must show before discovery that their claim appears plausible to a trial judge			0
the court expressed confidence in the " common sense and experience " of trial judges to know a plausible discrimination claim when they hear one			0
the court also found it implausible that federal law enforcement officials might have engaged in racial profiling after 9/11			1
in 2011 in @entity140 , the court held that a black man railroaded by the district attorney 's office in @entity144 and convicted of a murder he did not commit could not recover a judgment in a civil rights action he brought and won after serving 14 years on death row			0
just a month ago in @entity149 , the court held that jail officials were legally entitled to strip - search an @entity16 businessman , @entity151 , twice after he was wrongly arrested and held for a week in two @entity153 jails			0
in each case , the conservative majority never once addressed the racial context or racial implications of their decisions			0
the court appears poised to do the same next month in the case involving @entity161 immigration law , which gives local police the right to demand proof of citizenship from people they suspect are here illegally			0
this is at bottom a license for nationwide racial profiling under the guise of immigration enforcement and state 's rights			1
perhaps this is why chief justice @entity178 insisted on limiting the parameters of the case by stating at the outset of the solicitor general 's argument , " i 'd like to clear up what ( this case is ) not about			0
no part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling			2
" the meek acquiescence of the solicitor general to this judicial bullying was a failure of colossal proportions			0
the conservative majority may have the power to legalize racial profiling in this country , but they should not be permitted to pretend that this is not precisely what they are doing			1
this is precisely why we need a more robust and coherent understanding of how the concept of dignity underlies key provisions of our @entity91			0
although the @entity91 does not include an explicit right to dignity , as one scholar has recently explained , the @entity68 has long invoked dignity interests in its decisions			1
civil rights lawyers , scholars and activists need to remind the court and our nation about the centrality of dignity to our core constitutional protections			0
without this understanding , this court will continue unchecked until racial minorities in this country find themselves once again in a posture of abject indignity before the irrational policies of the state			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity229 : recognition of dignity *crucial* to grasping how racism cropping up in laws
@entity227 : examples of profiling include stop - and - frisk policy , post- 9/11 @entity63 surveillance
she says @entity68 has left racial *consideration* out of rulings when it 's clearly *relevant*
@entity227 : several rulings appear to make racial profiling part of law , and courts should admit it
