@entity0 , @entity1 -- the last bit of news i heard before boarding a plane to @entity0 a few days ago was that @entity7 had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with @entity1			1
disturbing news from @entity7 comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief			1
the many quirky , mystifying , baffling developments in @entity16 make its young ruler , @entity17 , an irresistible target for comedians			0
it was hard to suppress a laugh , for example , when @entity7 severely declared that an upcoming satirical @entity25 movie constituted " an act of war " and filed an official complaint with the @entity27			1
those are two sides of @entity7 -- deliberately frightening and inadvertently comical			1
then there 's a third side -- the part that makes us gasp in horror			2
a yearlong investigation conducted by the @entity27 found that @entity7 is a country whose depth of brutality " does not have any parallel in the contemporary world			1
" according to the report , @entity7 engages in murder , torture , slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission			1
stories from refugees who have escaped from @entity7 are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat , it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis			1
@entity7 is a @entity55 that is simultaneously threatening , bizarre and brutal			1
the regime 's unpredictability is one of the factors that allow a small , impoverished state , unable to feed its own people , to stand toe to toe with much more powerful rivals			2
it is those random , capricious , frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile , brittle , bankrupt @entity7 to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor , @entity1 , to maintain a constant state of alert , to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles away			1
with its conventional and nuclear arsenals , @entity7 manages to keep the international community , including the @entity74 , scrambling for an approach that might neutralize the danger and send a lifeline to the victims of the cruel regime			1
it 's tempting to ignore @entity7 's antics as bluster , as empty threats			1
but @entity16 has launched deadly attacks			0
for example , in 2010 , it bombed a @entity1 island about 70 miles from @entity0 , killing four people			1
it may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a @entity1 navy ship , killing 46			1
in 2013 , the @entity7 detonated a nuclear device and brazenly threatened to launch a " pre-emptive nuclear attack " against the @entity74 a fourth nuclear test could be imminent			2
after the most recent escalation , @entity1 president @entity96 spoke to military leaders and told them to prepare to retaliate			2
she described @entity16 as so erratic that you can not see " even an inch ahead			0
" the news from @entity7 can be so disconcerting that spoofs and rumors regularly make it into the news and social media as if they were fact			2
ahead of the @entity113 finals a satirical video purportedly showing a @entity7 newscast declaring the @entity7 's team a finalist for the @entity113 went viral , repeated as if it were true , as just another amusing moment from @entity16			1
and , why not ? truth and fiction are hard to tell apart			0
@entity16 has created its own version of the world for domestic consumption			0
@entity7 government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world -- second only to @entity125			2
the late ruler , @entity126 , was reported to have bowled a perfect game the first time he set foot on a bowling alley			0
he was also supposedly the world 's best golfer			2
the official biography of the country 's rulers has looked like something out of a @entity137 book story			0
no official biography of the current @entity17 has been released , other than an account that says he was " born in heaven			0
" that would fit with his father , @entity126 's official story , which claims he was born under a double rainbow with the seasons spontaneously changing and a new star appearing in the sky for the occasion			0
the three generations of @entity17 men who have ruled the @entity7 are painted as supernatural to the local population			2
abroad , they are cartoonish figures , whose behavior can leave diplomats and strategists scratching their heads			0
just a few months ago , the government published a gasp - inducing racist tirade against president @entity163 , calling him a " clown " who " does not even have the basic appearance of a human being			0
" it suggested he live with monkeys in a zoo			0
@entity171 , a myth of racial superiority , is a striking feature of the culture promoted by the regime			0
the authorities have created their own reality , brainwashed the population to keep the state functioning and the regime secure			0
to anyone who commits what the government deems an infraction , the punishment is inconceivably harsh			0
it 's all part of the riddle that keeps the world guessing , off - balance and nervous			0
by firing missiles , threatening neighbors and acting erratically , @entity7 portrays itself as mysterious and volatile , and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear , adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control .			1
