-- the successful @entity2 operation to detain @entity3 in @entity4 should be applauded			1
@entity3 is a suspect in the 2012 attack on the @entity7 mission			1
the operation to detain him had far more in common with pre- 9/11 counterterrorism operations than post- 9/11 and could presage a return to @entity2 's ability to credibly promote the rule of law in the world			1
the @entity2 largely lost that ability with the long , drawn - out attempts to justify @entity17 and the military commissions there , harsh interrogation , and the use of drones to carry out military attacks in places where the @entity2 is not at war			1
these policies and practices were instituted within days of the 9/11 attacks			2
as in the @entity32 era , the @entity29 , and the @entity30 , national leaders and large segments of the public believed extraordinary measures were warranted			0
one major difference between those emergencies of the past and today : the measures instituted previously ended far sooner than post- 9/11 policies			0
last year , president @entity40 quoted @entity41 on the risks to liberty of continual war			0
it is imperative that the @entity2 return to normalcy to preserve our rights			1
so while we can debate whether the post 9/11 measures were necessary or successful , no one should continue to argue that we need to leave them in place			0
the @entity3 operation demonstrates what we knew before 9/11			0
the law imposes no straightjacket when it comes to apprehending and prosecuting terrorism suspects			1
we used to be quite good at it			2
take the case of @entity61 , a member of @entity62 , arrested in 1987			0
in that year , undercover @entity64 agents lured @entity61 onto a yacht in the @entity66 by promising to let him in on a drug deal			0
@entity61 was wanted for the hijacking of a plane in @entity70 with four @entity2 on board			1
according to the judge 's opinion on the guilty verdict in his case , the @entity64 agents arrested @entity61 once the yacht was in international waters			0
" the agents transferred @entity61 to a @entity80 munitions ship and interrogated him for several days as the vessel steamed toward ... a @entity80 aircraft carrier			0
@entity61 was flown to @entity83 from the aircraft carrier , and taken from there to @entity84 in @entity84 , @entity61 was arraigned on an original indictment charging him with conspiracy hostage taking , and aircraft damage			0
" he was convicted and served many years in prison in the @entity2 and @entity70			1
@entity3 was also arrested pursuant to an indictment ; he was detained under law enforcement authorities , and will receive a trial before a duly constituted court in the @entity2			1
opinion : why @entity7 issue wo n't go away we should not expect any of the tough issues raised every time a hearing of any sort is brought before the @entity17 military commissions			1
those commissions are fatally flawed because they have been established in conflict with both peacetime procedural law and the law of armed conflict			1
the most serious flaw : the commissions were established after the crimes , to get convictions			2
courts need to be established to get justice , following objective criteria of fairness			2
nothing can be done to save the commissions			2
moreover , nothing needs to be done given the perfectly sound courts in the @entity2 , courts that heard the @entity61 case , the cases of the 1993 @entity117 bombers , the @entity119 bomber , pirates , organized crime kingpins , and that will hear @entity3 's case			1
of course , trial before a regular @entity2 court and an indictment are not the full requirements of the law			1
to come closer to full legality , @entity3 should have received the @entity133 by now ; he should be questioned by the @entity64 , not the military , and should have a defense lawyer present if he requests one			2
it also appears that he was detained without informing the @entity4 authorities			0
in the @entity61 case , the @entity64 was careful not to violate any state 's rights by arresting him in international waters			0
at present , the breakdown of authority in @entity4 is such that under the international law of countermeasures , the @entity2 can claim the right to carry out a law enforcement action without @entity4 consent			1
( this is an ironic situation since the @entity2 helped create the instability that prevails in @entity4 by fighting for regime change in 2011			1
) moreover , so long as the @entity2 military personnel involved in the @entity3 operation followed police - type law enforcement rules , they could lawfully be involved in the detention			1
their presence was not an unlawful use of force on @entity4 soil			2
that is one of the major differences between this action and drone strikes			2
@entity2 weaponized drones usually deploy the hellfire missile , which is a tank - killing weapon only appropriate where the @entity2 is engaged in battle as in @entity169 or where we have the right of self - defense , which has also only been in @entity169 post 9/11			2
in other countries where the @entity2 is using drone attacks -- @entity176 , @entity177 , and @entity178 -- the @entity2 has not been attacked in a way that can trigger our international right of self - defense			1
the law requires that the state using military force in self - defense counterattack only when it has been the victim of a significant attack by a state responsible for the attack			1
when the high threshold for self - defense is not met , countermeasures may be available			0
that is the law under which the @entity2 publicly defended the raid that killed @entity196			1
@entity198 's @entity197 announced to the world that the @entity200 who undertook the mission were under orders to arrest @entity196			0
killing him was only authorized if he resisted arrest			0
in other words , @entity197 announced that the @entity200 followed classic law enforcement rules			2
@entity207 human rights monitors had no objection			0
in the course of law enforcement there is no tolerance of " collateral damage " as on a battlefield			0
in the @entity196 and the @entity219 operations , family members , neighbors and passersby all survived because the @entity2 did not use drone - launched hellfire missiles			1
@entity221 , @entity17 and torture are not the way to respond to terrorism			0
operations consistent with the rule of law are			0
whether there was ever a justification for any of these policies post- 9/11 , it is long over			0
time to move on toward the rule of law .			0

@entity232 says capturing suspect in @entity7 attack is a good sign
she says it represents the @entity2 returning to using the law to fight terrorism
@entity232 : until now , the @entity2 has *relied* *heavily* on unlawful drone attacks
@entity2 courts , not military commissions , are right venue for trials of terrorists , she says
