long lines greeted early voters in @entity5 , @entity6 , last thursday			0
that means long lines , and many people stewing over the amount of time they have to wait to cast their ballots			0
we all get angry at times , but it 's what sets us off and how we manage that anger that set us apart			1
" it 's hard to say that anger is normal or not normal , " said @entity19 , a @entity20 , @entity21 - based clinical psychologist			1
" it 's how angry you allow yourself to become that 's either healthy or unhealthy			0
" the @entity27 said anger may result in physiological and biological changes			1
" it 's a flight or fight response , " @entity19 said			0
" basically , my heart rate gets high or my blood pressure gets higher			0
adrenaline and noradrenaline start secreting and it 's energizing me to do something			0
" he acknowledged that mismanaging anger can have a negative effect on health including increased cardiovascular problems such as heart attack and stroke , as well as poor lung function			1
among his patients , @entity19 revealed that he usually sees two extremes of anger : those who get too angry and those who ignore it all together			1
" it 's a good thing to become angry if someone is mistreating you , if you 're being exploited , if someone is cheating you or someone is abusing you in a relationship , " he said			0
" that is a healthy response			0
" what 's not healthy , he said , is ignoring a troubling situation and holding in your emotions			0
that can lead to depression and anxiety			1
similarly , he does n't recommend giving full vent to your anger and " letting it all hang out			2
" " if you found yourself breathing fast and really pushing to get your words out and your voice keeps rising , you 're getting too angry and you need to de-escalate , " @entity19 suggested			2
professional therapists can help you determine whether your temper is out of control			1
one way is to undergo psychological testing that determines the intensity of anger and how you deal with it			2
" professional therapists can give you tools to get things under control			1
not to make it go away , but to help control anger , " he said			1
he typically asks his patients whether they are using the anger to make positive changes or are " you letting it hijack you so you 're reacting in an overly aggressive way ? " @entity19 said some may find relief on their own and conduct their own version of anger management			1
" the most effective thing is to slow your breathing down , " @entity19 said			1
" take nice , slow , deep breaths			0
just de-escalate your heart rate			0
" the @entity27 recommended breathing from the diaphragm			1
shallow breathing from your chest wo n't be as relaxing , the group said			2
another way to cool off is to repeat calm sounding words or phrases such as " relax " and " take it easy , " the @entity27 suggested			1
@entity19 also touted the benefits of hitting an imaginary pause button during an angry situation and calling for a time out			0
redirecting your thinking can keep your temper from rising , he said			2
avoiding stimulating chemicals such as caffeine , alcohol and nicotine might make a difference			1
" a lot of times i 'll find people who are constantly angry and hot headed are ramped up on caffeine so their heart rate is already pretty high , " he said			0
finally , @entity19 urged his patients to review their past and consider whether they are harboring a grudge			0
" you need to go back and see if there is anyone you need to forgive because ... that can really make you angry at other things			2

anger is normal but what sets us off and how we react make a difference
@entity27 : anger can lead to physiological changes
a professional therapist can help determine whether your temper is out of control
