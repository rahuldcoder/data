-- for @entity2 , it 's not just a question -- it 's more like a campaign illness he 'd like to cure once and for all			2
" i was hoping i would be asked that question			0
it 's about time , " @entity2 joked at a recent @entity10 forum in @entity11			1
the question , of course , was about the health care reform bill @entity2 signed into law as governor of @entity19 in 2006			1
" ours is an experiment			0
some parts did n't work , " he explained to the crowd			0
what many tea party conservatives ca n't stand about the @entity19 health care law dubbed " @entity29 " is the plan 's individual mandate that requires people in that state to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty			1
the @entity36 in an editorial on thursday slammed @entity2 's reluctance to reject the individual mandate			2
" if he does not change his message , he might as well try to knock off @entity42 and get on the @entity44 ticket , " the newspaper wrote			0
republicans and @entity46 alike see " @entity29 " as the prototype for what conservatives deride as " @entity50			1
" a similar mandate in the president 's health care law is being challenged in federal courts			1
it 's a tight box for @entity2 : he must convince his fellow republicans to look past the very health care reform provision that 's at the heart of those court challenges			1
" the individual mandate is a deal - breaker			0
people do not want to see government dictating that they purchase what is a private product			0
we think that 's a disaster , " said @entity65 , president of @entity66			0
the group is a prominent tea party organizer that also happens to be led by libertarian billionaire @entity70			0
@entity65 is one of countless tea party activists who want to hear @entity2 reject the mandate			2
" i think it will be difficult for a lot of voters to get around if the individual mandate is not repudiated , " @entity65 said			0
that would be tricky for @entity2 who has repeatedly defended such mandates as a way to get the uninsured into the health care system			1
" in order to get the tax exemption that you would normally get , you have to have health insurance because we want everyone in the system			0
no more free riders , " @entity2 said in a 2009 interview with @entity0			2
in the same interview , @entity2 suggested that parts of the @entity19 experiment could serve as a model for national health care reform			1
" i think there are a number of features in the @entity19 plan that could inform @entity101 on ways to improve health care for all @entity104 , " @entity2 said			1
@entity46 have quotes like that cued up for the 2012 campaign			2
in a february speech to the @entity109 , @entity44 announced his administration 's plan to give states more flexibility in implementing the new national health care law			1
the president worked in a dig at @entity2			2
" i agree with @entity2 , who recently said he 's proud of what he accomplished on health care in @entity19 and supports giving states the power to determine their own health care solutions			1
he 's right , " @entity44 said			0
" mr. president , why did n't you call and ask how it worked , " @entity2 responded at that @entity10 forum in @entity11			1
it will be a hard sell for @entity10			0
former @entity131 governor and potential 2012 rival @entity130 has described " @entity29 " as " socialized medicine			2
" @entity2 has said repeatedly the @entity19 law is not perfect			1
in speech after speech , the former governor has claimed the plan was never intended as a " one - size fits all " program for the country			0
" we should learn from what 's working and what 's not working in @entity19 , " @entity2 told @entity0 in 2009			1
the former governor , who has yet to declare his candidacy for 2012 , has a new health care plan that he is to release thursday			1
it would repeal and replace the national health care law			1
instead , states would be allowed to conduct their own experiments in health care reform			2
it 's a potentially defining issue for a campaign that has n't officially launched			0
" somehow he 's got to convince the tea party people that he 's learned from his mistake without admitting he made a mistake			0
good luck , " said @entity158 with the @entity159			0
@entity2 's staff says do n't expect an apology for " @entity29			2
" after all , this is a man whose latest book is entitled " no apology			0

@entity2 is the former governor of @entity19 and 2008 @entity10 presidential *nominee*
@entity2 is under fire for a health care plan he signed into law as governor
republicans and @entity46 see " @entity29 " as the prototype for what conservatives deride as " @entity50 "
