" i believe that politics and religion should be completely separate , " protester @entity28 told @entity2 affiliate @entity29			2
" this has been , actually , one of those lines that has been blurred by that			2

it feels like why would someone not want us to live in love and respect , " said protester @entity36			2
a demonstration in @entity7 stretched out for five or six blocks			2
" hate is not hot , " read a banner at the front of the marchers			2

@entity9 opponents say the @entity97 - based church donated a majority of the money raised in support of the measure			1
the @entity100 believes it should not be singled out when other groups also supported the proposition			0

on thursday , @entity125 and @entity102 leaders said their efforts did not target any specific group			0

several groups have petitioned the @entity1 @entity16 to prevent the constitutional revision from taking effect			1
the @entity147 , @entity148 and the @entity149 have filed a lawsuit contending the ballot initiative was " improperly used			0
" according to the three groups , " such radical changes " as outlawing gay marriage can not be made by ballot initiative , but must , " at a minimum , go through the state legislature first			1
" the groups also argue the measure takes away a " fundamental right " from lesbian and gay @entity1			1
the three organizations filed the legal challenges on behalf of @entity163 and six same - sex couples who did not marry before tuesday 's election , but would like to be able to wed now			1

@entity168 , a @entity2 legal analyst , said thursday it is unclear whether same - sex weddings that took place before tuesday are still valid			1
referring to those couples , she said , " i think they really are in a legal limbo , a legal black hole			1
" voters in @entity178 and @entity179 also banned same - sex marriages in ballot initiatives tuesday .			1

protests continue over recent passage of same - sex marriage ban in @entity1
@entity187 overturns may ruling by @entity189 allowing gay marriages
legal status of same - sex weddings that occurred before ban remains unclear
