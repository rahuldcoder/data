forget about the @entity1 , the blizzard and the woes of the world			1
this time of year , everything 's better with puppies			1
seems like you ca n't throw a stick without running into a shaggy ( or short - haired ) dog story -- and advertisers , in particular , know that puppies demand attention			1
in recent years , the website registration and hosting company has earned the ire of many with its cheeky @entity1 ads featuring voluptuous women and suggestive copy			1
not that it 's stopped them from doing the same thing again the next year			2
but an ad about a puppy that 's put up for sale ? that 's going too far			1
a change.org petition garnered more than 40,000 signatures before word came that the ad would n't air during the big game			1
@entity33 , of course , would never provoke the anger of puppy lovers			1
the beer company has become a master of pulling @entity39 's heartstrings with its @entity1 commercials , which have included , in recent years , some friendly canines			1
this year , of course , is no different			2
" @entity33 unveils the commercial that will make you cry on @entity48 , " headlined @entity45			1
take that , @entity13 ! ( and yes , that 's a version of the @entity51 ' " i 'm @entity53 ) " as the soundtrack			1
no doubt even the brothers @entity56 are weeping			2
) finally , @entity58 , the ride - sharing app that has picked up quite a bit of bad press in recent months , has come up with a surefire way of earning public approval			1
if you guessed that it involves puppies , you 're right			1
the company announced wednesday that it 's teaming up with @entity68 , which broadcasts the annual @entity69 , to deliver puppies to offices in several @entity39 cities			2
it 's not free -- the price is $ 30 for 15 minutes of doggone fun -- but all proceeds go to participating local animal organizations			0
all together now : awwwww			0
what 's that ? you 're not a dog person ? well , there 's always the second - annual @entity83 , to be shown sunday on the @entity84			2
and cats can be heartwarming , too , as shown by a widely shared story out of @entity87 , @entity88			0
as originally reported by @entity87 's @entity90 , @entity91 the cat was hit by a car and pronounced dead			0
the cat 's grief - stricken owner , @entity93 , had the cat buried			2
five days later , @entity91 showed up at a neighbor 's door			0
his jaw was broken , and he was dirty and bloody -- but he was alive			0
" it was unbelievable , " @entity93 said			0
" the cat was smelly ; the cat was dirty			0
the cat had a big hole in the side of his head			0
" ' @entity107 ' presumed dead found alive five days after burial a veterinarian at the @entity110 of @entity111 performed surgery , and @entity91 , though he 'll probably lose an eye , is recovering nicely			0
" i truly think @entity91 has nine lives and has eight lives left , because it is miraculous what he 's done , " @entity110 of @entity111 executive director @entity114 told the tv station			0
so to heck with that football game and us crazy humans			0
we 'll say it again : @entity125 .			0

the @entity1 and puppies ! what more is there to say ?
@entity13 , @entity33 and @entity58 find value in puppy *marketing*
@entity13 has already pulled a puppy - themed ad after a *backlash*
