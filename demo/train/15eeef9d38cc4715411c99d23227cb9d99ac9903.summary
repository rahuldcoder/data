-- allegations of racial slurs and threats of violence against @entity6 lineman @entity5 have left pro bowler @entity7 suspended from the @entity6 and sparked widespread chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the @entity11			1
here are five key questions about what lies ahead : will the @entity6 cut @entity7 ? he 's been suspended " for conduct detrimental to the team			2
" as for his future , the @entity6 do n't seem poised to make a decision quickly			2
" we reached out to the @entity11 to conduct an objective and thorough review , " the team said in a statement			1
" we will continue to work with the league on this matter			2
" but the @entity24 reported that a club source told the newspaper that @entity7 was done with the team and will never play another game as a @entity29			2
and @entity30 cited two sources in the personnel departments of other teams that said he would have a difficult time finding another team to take a chance on him			0
" i think he can file his retirement papers , " one told the newspaper			0
for right now , all eyes will be on the @entity11 probe			1
@entity7 ' weathering the storm ' does @entity5 have a future in the @entity11 ? the 24 - year - old @entity5 , who played at @entity47 before going pro , left the team last week , during his second season			1
no matter what the investigation finds , it 's unclear whether he would want to come back			0
aside from the alleged threats and racial slurs from @entity7 , @entity5 has rejected parts of the culture of the @entity11 , according to some reports			1
some of @entity5 's teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when @entity5 sat down last week , infuriating @entity5 , according to an analyst for @entity63 called it a " lunch - room prank " that players pulled on whoever was last to arrive with his food			0
former @entity6 running back @entity69 told @entity0 the @entity11 is " like a closed fraternity			1
it 's really not made for everyone			0
" was there hazing , bullying , extortion ? given the allegations and the environment of the @entity11 , it 's unclear whether @entity5 was threatened , bullied , hazed , and / or even shaken down for money			1
the central allegations involve voice mails in which @entity7 allegedly used racial slurs and threatened physical violence against @entity5			1
one transcript , published by @entity63 , includes an apparent reference to @entity5 's biracial background			0
in the call , @entity7 allegedly referred to @entity5 as a " half ( expletive ) piece of ( expletive ) , " and threatened , among other things , " i 'll kill you			0
" @entity7 apparently denied the accusation , tweeting @entity93 , which had reported the transcript , " shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation			0
" the tweet and others were later deleted , according to @entity100			0
@entity93 reported that @entity7 allegedly got @entity5 to contribute $ 15,000 to help finance a trip to @entity102 by a group of @entity6 even though @entity5 preferred not to travel with them			0
@entity5 gave @entity7 the money , fearing the consequences if he did not , the report said			0
how common is this behavior ? @entity109 calls the @entity11 " a naturally twisted workplace			1
" there is " often a blurry line between hazing and outright abuse , " it says			1
" when your job is to be a maniac on the field , it should n't be surprising that a player like @entity7 , who has a history of anger management and substance abuse issues , could take things too far			0
" the attention around the @entity127 case shines a light on that blurry line			0
former offensive lineman @entity130 described a hazing incident in 1998 , when he and other @entity133 rookies ran through a hallway with pillowcases on their heads while teammates punched and kicked them , @entity109 reports			1
still , @entity7 's alleged behavior should n't be seen as representative of many players , analysts say			2
" if the evidence is factual , @entity6 guard @entity7 is a racist , a bully and one of the lower forms of life known to man , " writes @entity143 columnist @entity142			0
and while some @entity11 players and personnel believe @entity5 should not have made the issue public , they 're also not defending @entity7 , @entity142 says			1
what will the @entity11 do ? this case could rattle the culture of the @entity11			1
it will force the league to establish just what forms of behavior are acceptable , and what 's done to make sure those standards are followed			2
who , if anyone , will police players when they stray from what 's allowed ? will coaches be held accountable ? @entity6 head coach @entity175 " has to bear his share of blame here , " @entity30 quotes @entity143 's @entity170 as saying			0
" the buck stops with him concerning what happens in the locker room ...			0
( @entity180 ) he coach is ultimately responsible for player behavior getting out of hand			2
" the @entity183 issued a statement saying it expects " that the @entity11 and its clubs create a safe and professional workplace for all players , and that owners , executives , coaches and players should set the best standards and examples			1
" as the @entity11 launches its probe , it could find itself officially informed of numerous other incidents throughout the league			1
this one case between two men could prove the catalyst for the league to acknowledge and deal with disturbing behavior in its ranks .			2
