@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 caucuses are 16 months away , but judging from the way potential presidential candidates are visiting this state , you 'd think they were next week			1
but @entity9 hopefuls are taking advantage of the fact that next week is the first competitive @entity13 election here in decades			1
they 're coming to campaign with the candidates early and often			0
@entity17 's wednesday with the @entity19 @entity13 candidate @entity18 was about electing @entity18			1
she talked almost exclusively about his bona fides , and the problems with his @entity24 opponent			1
but just the fact that she was here , helping her fellow @entity27 , will score points with the local leaders and hard core party voters she will need to back her in 2016 -- especially since @entity1 was @entity33 for her candidacy eight years ago when she came in third in the @entity1 caucuses			1
although this time around @entity36 does n't appear to have as much competition , other @entity19 with 2016 buzz have been here too -- from @entity40 sen. @entity39 to @entity42 governor @entity41 to @entity44 senator @entity43			0
on the much more wide open and chaotic @entity24 side , @entity24 @entity13 candidate @entity45 can barely go a day without a @entity9 hopeful next to her			1
the day we were with her it was @entity51 @entity50 sen. @entity50 , who broke his own rule of not picking sides in @entity24 primaries to endorse @entity55 early on , and he 's been here several times since to campaign with her			1
" how @entity1 goes , the @entity13 will go			2
the @entity61 may very well be decided here in @entity1 this year , " @entity50 told us in an interview during one of his three campaign stops with @entity55			2
and though he too was careful to make his public remarks about the @entity13 race , helping @entity55 win , pressing the flesh with @entity1 voters who are used to getting to know their presidential candidates is undeniably helpful			1
@entity50 said he has visited @entity1 three or four times this midterm election year , ( but who 's counting ) and he 's hardly alone			1
@entity73 gov. @entity72 , former @entity75 sen. @entity74 , @entity77 gov. @entity76 , former @entity79 gov. @entity78 , @entity73 sen. @entity80 , @entity82 rep. @entity81 , @entity84 gov. @entity83 , and @entity86 sen. @entity85 have all made multiple visits to the @entity1 in 2014 alone			2
even @entity89 sen. @entity88 , who said recently he might consider running for president , campaigned with @entity55 last week despite the fact that he 's on the ballot in his own state tuesday			2
@entity85 had the good fortune of being chosen by the @entity96 @entity95 , a powerful @entity24 force , to appear straight to camera in their new closing television ad here			2
" if you 're a freedom loving , liberty loving voter i urge you to get out and vote for @entity45 this tuesday , " @entity85 says in the ad			0
but sometimes testing the waters can be treacherous			0
though @entity50 received several warm greetings with not - so - veiled references to his presidential ambitions , one voter , @entity107 , was looking for someone else -- and told him so			0
@entity107 stopped @entity50 when he was working the crowd in @entity113 , @entity1 , to ask about @entity114			0
" can we convince @entity114 to run ? " @entity107 asked @entity50			0
" i do n't know you 'll have to ask him , " @entity50 responded with a smile			0
" i did , " @entity107 said			0
@entity120 @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
