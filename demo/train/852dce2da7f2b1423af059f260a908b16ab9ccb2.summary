-- @entity1 , 38 , has never lived a day in which his father @entity2 did n't rule @entity4 -- as its undisputed leader inside the country and an enigmatic , controversial voice for the world			1
and yet , as the @entity4 government faced a stiff popular uprising , it was @entity14 's second eldest son -- and not the @entity15 himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it			2
the speech , made early monday on @entity4 state television , does not mean that @entity22 has usurped power from his father : senior @entity26 officials said there 's no indication the elder @entity1 is losing his grip			1
still , many were left thinking : why did @entity1 speak ? there was no public explanation why his father , who state - run tv showed repeatedly being showered with support as his limousine rolled down a packed @entity37 street or in a crowded hall , did n't talk			1
one way to explain the choice , said @entity41 of the @entity42 for @entity43 think tank , is @entity14 is " consistently inconsistent " -- meaning , his decisions are famously hard to understand or predict			0
still , experts say , what may make @entity1 stand out most is that , among his relatives , he seems the polar opposite of his father			2
" i do n't think @entity1 is a hated figure , " said @entity51 of the @entity52 , a @entity53 think tank			0
" he has seemed to have some good intentions			0
" whereas @entity14 years ago launched a program to " destroy imported ideologies , whether they are eastern or @entity59 , " his son speaks fluent @entity60 , earned his phd from the @entity62 , written an op - ed in the @entity64 and has been a frequent go - between in talks with international officials			2
@entity2 rarely goes anywhere without a distinctive tribal dress and an ornate @entity71 tent			0
the well - traveled @entity1 , meanwhile , addressed the @entity4 nation early monday in western business attire : a suit and tie			1
while the father runs a nation , his son 's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as general coordinator , a position like many in the nation 's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity , the @entity88			0
thus , instead of calling @entity91 militants " mad dogs " and " terrorists , " @entity1 's charity last week engineered the prison release of 110 members of the @entity96			2
and lastly , while the elder @entity1 is known for his heavy - handed rule in @entity4 and its restrictions on civil rights and more , @entity22 has fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people			1
still , the sputtering of @entity22 's public pro-democracy and pro-rights agenda suggest the real limits on his authority			2
while some long banned non-governmental organizations and media were allowed into @entity4 for the first time in recent years , access was tightly controlled and the movement 's momentum stalled			0
" periodically , his father has given him a bit of leash and ( @entity1 ) has gone out and talked about creating a constitution " and similar reforms , said @entity41 , a former @entity116 official			2
" but then these things get reined back			0
" in fact , until monday , many experts felt the most powerful @entity14 outside of @entity2 was @entity1 's brother , @entity125 , @entity4 's national security advisor			1
@entity1 's rights - centered focus and @entity59 outreach put him at odds with the country 's old guard			1
thus , his monday speech notwithstanding , @entity51 said she did n't think it was a precursor to @entity1 taking his father 's place			1
" right now , my gut tells me it 's unlikely that @entity1 would emerge , " said @entity51 , who is also editor of the @entity137			0
" he 's rather weak			0
" and @entity51 said @entity1 's gambit , proposing a major political reforms if the uprising ends , is n't likely to end in a deal			0
beyond the fact there 's little indication that anti-government demonstrators will give up their fight , @entity4 has shown little inclination to liberalize or democratize in the 42 years under his father			1
moreover , for all their differences , @entity1 's standing in the world is still largely defined by his father 's role in @entity4			1
even while some may see the son as more open to change , there 's little question that his loyalty remains first with @entity2 and that his father has given little indication publicly that he 's ready to let go and calls the shots			1
" those promises have much less credibility than what they might have in other @entity168 countries , " she said			0
" people have no faith in the family			0

@entity1 , 38 , gives @entity4 's first public speech acknowledging unrest
there 's been no public indication why he , and not his father @entity2 , talked
as @entity59 - *educated* and reform - minded , @entity1 has differences with his father
an expert says that , his speech notwithstanding , it 's unlikely @entity1 will rise to power
