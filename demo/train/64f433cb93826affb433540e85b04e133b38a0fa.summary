-- the movement to eradicate food deserts would benefit from , of all things , banishment of the term food desert			1
in a job where i 'm seeking innovations that allow more families to have better access to fresh fruits and vegetables , i 'm struck that advocates seem mostly interested in mapping and remapping the same neighborhoods to establish conclusive proof that food deserts exist			1
by the @entity20 definition , that means documenting " a census tract with a substantial share of residents who live in low - income areas that have low levels of access to a grocery store or healthy , affordable food retail outlet			1
" the problem is that this approach focuses on diagnosis but not cure			0
it 's as if doctors kept perfecting the test for polio without looking for a vaccine			0
the food desert diagnosis too easily turns into a club used to beat families most in need			1
being labeled a food desert makes a neighborhood undesirable , rather than a target of opportunity			1
the discussion gets mean - spirited when critics assert that it 's the people -- not the neighborhoods -- who are broken			2
in poor neighborhoods where there 's more violence and limited opportunities , some assume that residents brought the difficult circumstances on themselves , that families like living on the dole			2
either way , it 's the same conclusion : those people got what they deserved			0
to buy the critics ' argument means you have to believe a mother would put her family in life - threatening situations , endure the suffering associated with hunger , opt out of the @entity74 , all to get about $ 4.50 a day in federal food assistance			2
on top of everything else , as economist @entity79 and others have pointed out , the government 's food desert definition might not matter much			1
what we need is the recognition that food represents heritage , love , faith , healing and family pride			2
food builds community and helps reduce social isolation			2
what we need is experimentation with new ownership , supply chain and distribution models to disrupt the existing food systems			1
what we need is a @entity102			1
there is an untapped demand for fresh fruits and vegetables			2
unlocking the demand requires understanding that food access is about relationships , not transactions			2
families wo n't respond to the food police nagging them to eat their veggies			1
outsiders dropping off a pallet of free food wo n't cut it			2
families will respond positively to cooking classes with their friends , celebrations of family kitchen traditions and high - quality produce distributed through trusted sources			0
@entity127 grocer @entity125 has opened supermarkets in neighborhoods written off as food deserts			1
he hires from the neighborhood , adds specialty items the neighbors like and puts health clinics and community meeting rooms inside his stores			2
@entity102 innovators focus on what they can do , not what they ca n't			1
in @entity143 , community activists came up with @entity144 , a grocery on wheels			0
in @entity148 , @entity147 's @entity146 created a mobile market and a farm - to - table distribution business serving low - income families			0
it 's now launching a grocery store			0
in @entity156 , @entity155 's virtual supermarket allows residents to order healthy food and pick up their deliveries at neighborhood libraries , schools and senior housing sites			1
in @entity166 , across the street from the @entity165 , @entity163 turned a neglected property into a six - acre farm , @entity169 , with an on - site market			0
he is transforming a neighborhood into a @entity102			1
customers keep coming back for chemical - free kale , squash and other whole foods			0
the distribution model is creative			0
many shoppers pay full price			0
thanks to foundation grants , families using @entity182 benefits get $ 2 worth of food for every $ 1 spent			2
for people who are broke and hungry , @entity163 makes sure they get food			1
there 's an easy way to test the usefulness of the food desert label			1
show up at a neighborhood meeting with research on how residents are living in a food desert			1
guess what ? they already know			0
ask residents how they want to transform their neighborhood into a @entity102			1
i 've done it , and residents have lots of ideas			0
they want to turn vacant lots into gardens , learn canning techniques so summer vegetables will be available year round and teach young people the joy of making casseroles			0
sorting through all of the answers , it boils down to three things : eat			0
@entity218 , whose @entity219 and garden firm creates landscapes that feed people , figured this out when he was working with high school kids through @entity225 in @entity226			0
he saw that young people were interested in culinary traditions			0
he taught them that the way to eat what you want is by learning to cook			0
to get the ingredients for the recipes -- these young people discovered -- they had to grow the food			0
we all get the food desert diagnosis			1
like @entity218 's kids , we 're ready to create a @entity102			1
we 're ready to eat , cook and grow			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

@entity240 : the movement to get rid of food deserts can start with banishing the term
bare : being labeled a " food desert " makes a neighborhood undesirable
he says we need a @entity102 movement that disrupts existing food systems
bare : innovators are taking fresh food to neighborhoods *inspiring* locals to eat better
