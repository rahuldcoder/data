-- she 's been called @entity3 's answer to @entity4 , and she does n't pull any punches -- even when the subject she 's taking to task is @entity3 leader @entity8			1
filmmaker @entity9 puts the prime minister 's handling of the @entity13 earthquake , which killed nearly 300 people and devastated the city when it struck last year , under deep scrutiny in her latest documentary " @entity18 -- @entity3 trembles			1
" recently screened at @entity20 , the documentary is creating a stir among critics and the @entity3 government alike			1
even though he has been dogged by allegations of corruption and fraud -- which he strongly denies -- as well as criticism of his personal lifestyle , many @entity3 still support @entity8			1
there are so many scandals in @entity3 , the picture can get quite complicated , @entity9 told @entity0			1
at home , she is a well - known political satirist and critic of the government			0
she decided to focus on one disaster , @entity13 , to show how abuse of power , corruption and misinformation have contributed to what she presents as the precarious state of democracy in @entity3 today			1
" the idea was this : explain @entity3 through @entity13 , " she told @entity0			1
the @entity3 government has responded angrily to the film , whose title is a combination of the words " @entity52 " and " @entity13			1
" culture minister @entity53 refused to attend @entity20 , where the film was shown as part of the festival 's special screening program			2
@entity53 issued a statement , dismissing the documentary as " propaganda " and saying it " offends the truth and all of the @entity3 people			2
" @entity9 is used to incurring the government 's displeasure			0
" @entity70 , " a political satire tv show she wrote , directed and acted in , was cancelled after just one episode on a state - owned television network following a defamation suit filed by @entity8 's @entity69 tv network			0
in a retort , she made " @entity74 , " a 2005 film that examines censorship			0
so , what is it about " @entity18 , " @entity9 's fourth feature , that has created an uproar among @entity8 supporters ? @entity9 argues that @entity8 , whose ratings were suffering when the earthquake hit in april last year , took advantage of the tragic event to improve his image and boost the public 's opinion of him			1
the documentary uses straightforward language to paint a stark picture of what the filmmaker sees as @entity8 's exploitation of the tragic event			2
" opinion polls showed his popularity was plummeting			0
so , when , at 0332 on april 6 , 2009 , an earthquake awoke even those in the @entity104 house , and when it emerged an entire town was destroyed , for @entity8 it was like @entity106 reaching out to him again , " a voiceover says in the film			2
watch a clip of the film in the wake of the quake , @entity8 made a last - minute decision to move the @entity112 to @entity13 from @entity113 -- a gesture that attracted world attention -- and took advantage of photo opportunities in several trips to the leveled city			1
even more damning , though , is the documentary 's examination of the reconstruction efforts in @entity13			2
in particular , the film takes issue with the role played by the @entity126			1
the film argues that the government agency has amassed such immense power under @entity8 that it can dodge the law -- when granting reconstruction contracts , for instance -- all in the name of emergency and safety			0
for @entity9 , investigating the aftermath of the earthquake and the power of the @entity126 is a way of examining @entity3 's drift into authoritarianism			1
" they became like a private army of the prime minister with licence of spending money and making laws , " she said of the agency			2
" and i was shocked and started to investigate			0
" her film has won praise , not only for its high degree of scrutiny , but for its even - handedness as well			0
the @entity154 described " @entity18 " as a " straightforward and surprisingly balanced documentary			0
" while her probing style and knack for ruffling feathers make it easy to draw comparisons with @entity4 , @entity9 distinguishes herself with an ability to control her outrage			0
as @entity165 pointed out in its review : " while she 's omnipresent , this is not the @entity9 show ; the helmer knows she does n't need to constantly register her outrage for it to come across			0
" @entity167 and @entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
