-- you may have heard it before : billions of years ago @entity3 probably looked more like @entity4 does now , with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere			1
it may even have had some type of microbes			0
but now it 's a barren , frozen desert			0
so what happened ? where did the air and water go ? @entity16 is launching a new spacecraft to try to find out			1
it 's called @entity19 , which stands for @entity19			2
it 's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet 's upper atmosphere			2
" we expect to learn how the modern @entity3 works , really in detail			0
to see its climate state , to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how @entity3 may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time , " said @entity16 's @entity26			1
the earliest liftoff time for @entity19 is monday , november 18 , at 1:28 p.m. et from @entity33 in @entity34			0
a @entity36 rocket will launch the probe into space on a 10 - month trip to @entity3			2
it 's scheduled to arrive september 22 , 2014			1
the solar - powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet ( 11.43 meters ) long -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds ( 2,454 kg ) at launch			0
what killed @entity3 ? new spacecraft will find out " @entity19 will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the @entity3 environment , " principal investigator @entity56 , from the @entity57 , says on his @entity16 webpage			1
he says he 's " excited that we 're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on @entity3			2
" @entity56 's team will use the spacecraft 's three instrument suites to try to meet three key objectives : â € ¢ determine the composition of upper @entity3 atmosphere â € ¢ determine how fast @entity3 is losing what 's left of its atmosphere â € ¢ determine the history of the atmosphere @entity19 wo n't make a cool , daring landing like the @entity76 , which has been roaming @entity3 for more than a year now			1
instead , it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles ( 150 kilometers ) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles ( 6,000 kilometers )			0
it also will make five dives , flying as low as 77 miles ( 125 kilometers ) in altitude			0
@entity16 says the mission will cost $ 671 million			0
