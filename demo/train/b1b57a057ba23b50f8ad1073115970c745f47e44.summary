both men lit themselves on fire in protest			2
but only one of them is credited with starting a revolution			2
the difference between the two ? mobile phones recorded @entity8 , a @entity10 fruit vendor , as he set himself ablaze in despair over his economic plight			1
those videos kicked off the wave of 2011 @entity16 demonstrations			2
@entity17 , the other man , fell into relative obscurity			2
the example , cited in the book " the @entity21 , " highlights just one of the many superpowers that mobile phones -- and to a lesser extent , tablets -- have bestowed upon humanity			1
in addition to enabling us to video events on a second 's notice , potentially altering the course of global politics , these high - tech human " appendages " increasingly have become tools for fighting corruption , buying stuff , bolstering memory , promoting politics , improving education and giving people around the world more access to health care			1
they 've shaken up our social lives , too			2
forget letters and phone calls			2
texts are the currency of modern conversation -- and mobile internet searches are the way to solve disputes of fact or trivia			1
dating apps search suitors by location , and mobile maps ensure we app - enabled superhumans ca n't get lost , as long as there 's a wireless signal			1
phones , it seems , help us do everything but			1
at a time when new smartphones seem to hit the market every couple of days and our faces increasingly are glued to digital screens , @entity72 is taking a special look at the myriad ways mobile technology is affecting our lives			1
the monthlong series is called " @entity85			0
" " this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we 've connected in this way , " @entity86 , a " cyborg anthropologist , " said in a 2010 lecture at @entity88			0
" and it 's not that machines are taking over			0
it 's that they 're helping us to be more human			1
they 're helping us to connect to each other			1
the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives			0
" ' like a phantom limb ' phones are so cherished -- or so depended upon -- that 68 % of us sleep with them at our bedside , according to a 5,000 - person global survey conducted by @entity110 and @entity111 , which shares a parent company with @entity72			1
three - quarters of @entity114 surveyed said being " constantly connected by technology " is helpful			0
some take that idea to extremes			0
@entity119 , author of " the @entity21 " and ceo of @entity121 , said he checks his phone for updates at least once a minute -- " i must look at it 500 times a day , or 1,000 times a day , " he said			0
almost nothing would make him put his phone down			0
" if i was with the queen of @entity129 and she was addressing me directly and it was a one - on - one conversation , then i would probably discipline myself to not look at my phone , so as to not show disrespect to her			0
" the phone , otherwise , is just too helpful at keeping @entity119 linked , constantly , to his colleagues and friends , who send him a fire hose of instant messages and updates			0
for all the potential benefits , however , @entity139 and other observers of mobile culture see negative consequences as well			1
being connected digitally to everyone all the time also can lead , somewhat surprisingly , to a sense of isolation and loneliness			0
" teenagers tell me they sleep with their cell phone , and even when it is n't on their person , when it has been banished to the school locker , for instance , they know when their phone is vibrating , " @entity157 professor @entity156 writes in the book " @entity156 : why we expect more from technology and @entity160			1
" " the technology has become like a phantom limb , it is so much a part of them			1
these young people are among the first to grow up with an expectation of continuous connection : always on , and always on them			1
" another young person , age 13 , told @entity156 she does n't like to pick up the phone , only text			0
" texting offers just the right amount of access , just the right amount of control , " the author writes			0
" she is a modern @entity178 : for her , texting puts people not too close , not too far , but at just the right distance			1
the world is now full of modern @entity183 , people who take comfort in being in touch with a lot of people whom they also keep at bay			1
" nearly 6 billion phones regardless of the effects , adoption of mobile tech seems to be going only one direction : up			1
there were nearly 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide in 2011 , according to the @entity198 , a branch of the @entity199			1
there are 7 billion people in the world			1
some have multiple mobile contracts , but technology is clearly widespread			1
@entity119 , the author and ceo , estimates 5 billion people will have smartphones in the next five years , giving those people access to the mobile internet and apps			1
the @entity114 already reached a tipping point this year : the majority of @entity114 phone owners now have smartphones			0
these phones , such as those running the @entity220 and @entity222 operating systems , offer " more computing power than @entity224 when it landed a man on the moon , " @entity217 writes for @entity111			1
" in many parts of the world , more people have access to a mobile device than to a toilet or running water , " she writes			1
" for millions , this is the first phone they 've ever had			0
" gibbs and other writers cite the astounding speed with which mobile phones have come to dominate our lives in the decades since @entity242 , from @entity243 , placed the first public cellular telephone call on a brick - size phone in 1973			1
( he called a competitor at @entity248 , in case you 're curious			0
) it took years for mobile - networking technology to develop and for cellular towers to go up			1
after mobile calls became more commonplace in a few developed countries , manufacturers added keyboards and larger screens , clearing the way for the sms and mobile e-mail revolutions			2
by the 2000s , a host of sensors -- from @entity264 , which enables mobile mapping , to accelerometers , which helps the phone know if it 's being tilted -- were being squeezed into the gadgets			2
the mother of all smartphones , the @entity272 , debuted in 2007 with all these accouterments			0
by then , phones had become the warehouse for technological innovation -- the @entity278 knives of modern living , as many authors have argued			1
if you include tablets and e-readers in the mix , mobile devices have come to rival desktop computers and laptops for their usefulness in life and business			2
" the reason why mobile technology is uniquely interesting to the world right now is because it represents the fifth wave of computing , " @entity119 said , with smartphones following @entity293 - enabled computing , desktops , minicomputers and early computer mainframes on the timeline			1
" and technology really is about what happens to the entire civilization of some several billion people or more when there is useful software running on the person and in the hand of everybody , every minute of the day			2
" smartphone superpowers there are plenty of potential superpowers these always - on mobile gadgets could give us			2
one of the more futuristic , as outlined by @entity318 this year , is a sort of digital x-ray , or " @entity322 " vision			0
using augmented - reality technology , that company and others hope to superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the real world			0
a person wearing @entity318 's prototype of high - tech glasses , for example , might see data about people they encounter or about deals offered inside restaurants they pass			2
other efforts aim to empower people literally to open doors or pay for coffee with a tap of their phone , and to identify themselves using @entity348 chips that are built into newer smartphones			2
meanwhile , schools in rural parts of @entity352 that never had textbooks are incorporating smartphones as an information source with the help of @entity357 , chief technology officer at @entity358			0
" i know they are not only using the technology , " @entity357 said , " but they are getting smarter and smarter every day			0
" and researchers , including @entity364 at @entity365 , are trying to use mobile phones to bring medical care to remote corners of the world where people otherwise would have to walk for a day or more to see a doctor or nurse			1
@entity374 ' group has been working on a paper chip that could be touched with a drop of blood and then photographed and text messaged to a clinic that could analyze it and offer a diagnosis			0
suddenly , doctors have the superhuman ability to see patients far afield			0
new implementations for smartphones do n't always work , of course , @entity358 's @entity357 said			0
but over time , there 's hope smartphones will be a radical , democratizing force -- particularly as they become more affordable for everyone			0
" @entity393 took thousands of years to run its course			0
the @entity395 required a few centuries			0
the @entity397 , propelled by mobile technology will likely reshape our world on the order of decades , " @entity119 writes			2
" but despite the turbulence ahead , we live at one of the greatest times in history			0
software will suffuse the planet , filling in every niche , and exciting opportunities will lie everywhere			0

mobile phones have become human " appendages " or " phantom limbs "
they connect us to each other in ways *previously* *unimaginable*
survey finds 68 % of people sleep with their phones at bedside
modern phones pack " more computing power than @entity224 , " *essayist* says
