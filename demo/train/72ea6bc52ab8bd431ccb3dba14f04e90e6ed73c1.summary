@entity0 -- seventy - five additional bodies have been recovered from the wreckage of an @entity9 plane that crashed off the coast of @entity11 two years ago , more than doubling the number of remains that have been found , the vice-president of the @entity5 victims ' association told @entity1 tuesday			1
the remains have not yet been identified , @entity14 said			1
@entity9 447 plunged into the @entity16 on june 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 people aboard			1
the bulk of the wreckage was found this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range			2
many bodies were still in the fuselage , investigators said at the time			2
only about 50 bodies were recovered in the days following the crash			1
@entity14 got the news from a @entity5 government liaison appointed to deal with families of victims , he said			1
" personally , i would have preferred to leave the bodies of our loved ones on the seafloor , " he added , repeating his long - held view			2
the @entity11 national news agency @entity38 reported tuesday that @entity39 , head of the @entity11 victims organization , said that with the latest recovery , the number of bodies found since the accident now totals 127			1
details of the doomed plane 's last minutes only began to emerge last week as @entity5 air accident investigators studied data recorders recovered from the wreck earlier this year			1
the @entity50 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions , @entity5 's @entity54 ( @entity54 ) said friday			1
the pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash , according to an interim report			2
the aircraft climbed to 38,000 feet when " the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled , " the report says			0
aviation experts are asking why the pilots responded to the stall by pulling the nose up instead of pushing it down to recover			0
@entity66 , a pilot and aviation analyst , said : " you push down on the wheel to gain air speed , perhaps they ( pilots ) were getting information that the air speed was too high			0
pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall			0
" the speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were " inconsistent " with those on the integrated standby instrument system ( @entity82 ) , the report says			0
the aircraft experienced some " rolling " before stalling and then descending rapidly at 10,912 feet ( 3,300 meters ) per minute			0
at the time of the descent , the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit			0
all 228 people aboard the @entity91 from @entity92 to @entity0 were killed on june 1 , 2009			1
the pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the @entity16 known for constant bands of severe turbulence			0
air crash investigators at the @entity0 - based @entity54 have been working on the theory that the speed sensors , known as pitot tubes or probes , malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude			0
@entity1 's @entity106 contributed to this report .			0

the remains have not been identified , a @entity5 *relative* says
the recovery more than doubles the number of bodies found since the 2009 crash
@entity9 447 plunged into the ocean , killing 228 people
