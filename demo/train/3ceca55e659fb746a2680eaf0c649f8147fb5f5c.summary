-- they chased tornadoes not so much for the thrill , but in the hope that their research might help people avoid the fate to which they succumbed last week			0
veteran storm chaser @entity9 , 54 ; his chase partner of a decade , @entity10 , 45 ; and @entity9 ' son , @entity11 , 24 , a photographer , died friday in an @entity13 - 3 tornado in @entity14 , @entity15			1
crews hauled away their white truck sunday			2
it had been crushed like a tin can , its metal frame violently twisted and its windows smashed			0
@entity9 ' brother , @entity22 , said he was stunned to learn of his brother 's death , simply because @entity9 was so well - versed in the ways of tornadoes			1
storm chasing : science , thrill - seeking or tourism ? " i just could n't ever think it would ever happen to him because of his level of expertise , years of doing this , " the brother said			1
" if i had to have a way for my brother to die , it would be doing what he did -- chasing tornadoes			1
" @entity9 , whose team 's work was featured on the @entity43 's " @entity11 , " had been on twisters ' trails for more than a quarter - century , and @entity46 described him as a self - taught forecaster and engineer who developed much of the equipment he used to measure storms			1
" he was a pioneer in terms of making surface measurements inside of tornadoes			0
he was always at the forefront of tornado measurements , " said the channel 's severe weather expert , @entity55 , who further described the elder @entity9 as an " amazing scientist			1
" @entity9 told @entity46 years ago that he caught the engineering bug as a kid dismantling his mother 's appliances -- " blenders , toasters , television sets , you name it " -- and reassembling them			1
yet he was no one - trick pony			0
he had a penchant for studying high - speed camera imaging , lightning and explosions			0
per the latter , he participated in the investigations of the crash of @entity79 and of the @entity81 bombing			0
per the former , his son in december posted a photo of a tornado on the horizon , an unpaved rural road buttressed by farmland in the foreground			2
" as much as he denies it , my dad does have an artistic side , " @entity11 wrote on @entity90 , garnering 115 likes			1
@entity9 also co-authored the book " @entity99 , " held a patent for a thermal imaging system for internal combustion engines and had a patent pending for a " new , 3 - dimensional windspeed measurement , " according to a copy of his resume posted at @entity104 , a company he founded to learn more about tornadoes with the goal of increasing public warning times			1
@entity10 had been heading out with @entity9 since 2003 , according to his @entity43 biography			1
a native @entity109 who had worked on @entity111 film crews up until 2000 , he began chasing storms as part of a two - month adventure to catch glimpses of the storms along the @entity117			1
" experiencing the raw force of nature in @entity121 was unlike any pyrotechnic display on a high - tech @entity111 set ! " the bio says			1
" this inspiration led @entity10 to the study of tornado dynamics and ultimately a masters degree in atmospheric science from the @entity130			1
" at a meteorological conference , @entity9 encouraged @entity10 to gather data from inside tornadoes for his thesis , and a partnership was born			1
the pair would go on to track more than 125 tornadoes			0
" @entity10 's finest moment came on june 11 , 2004 , near @entity139 , @entity140			1
working with @entity9 , they defied the odds and deployed their probes right in the path of a tornado , " according to the @entity43			1
" the six - camera video probe captured amazing footage from multiple angles while the sensor probe recorded data that revealed just how fast wind speeds are close to the ground			0
" tornadoes rip through heartland again : how to help @entity11 had recently started joining his dad on chases			1
in a @entity158 interview last month , ahead of a trip father and son would take together , @entity9 said @entity11 was becoming " quite a talented videographer " and joked about how well his team members got to know each other during their days - long pursuits			1
" you spend three or four days in a vehicle , it develops a certain scent			0
after a three - to four - day trip , we 've got a lot of knowledge of each other and what 's going on in our lives , " he said			2
" fortunately , our group gets along really well			0
that 's the secret -- you need people who are compatible			2
and of course , showering regularly is a good thing , too			0
" @entity11 " loved being out with his @entity186 , " his sisters and mother said in a statement			2
" he had a true gift for photography and a love of storms like his @entity186			0
they made a special team			0
" fellow storm chaser @entity194 said on @entity90 that he and his colleagues were often impressed with @entity11 ' work from behind the camera			1
he and another storm chaser , @entity202 , " would always laugh cause we 'd take great shots then see @entity11 's , and just shake our heads cause he just had the talent			1
" " @entity11 was goofy , and it was fun to watch him grow over the years			1
he was so quiet in the early times , and watch him become someone who could capture a moment so vividly			0
he shot one of the most amazing tornado photos i have ever seen hanging out the window of my mesonet car in @entity15 back in 2011 , " @entity194 wrote on his @entity90 page , referring to the meteorological monitoring network known as a mesonet			2
" he was quirky , fun , and just so easy going			1
he always ( rode ) along with @entity202 and i during our missions , and you could count on him to make them all memorable			0
" the @entity219 and @entity10 fell victim to particularly unpredictable storm , even for a tornado			1
not only does a preliminary @entity225 rating peg its winds at more than 136 mph , many reports indicate it took a sudden left - hand turn along its path , about 30 miles west of @entity81			2
photos from a professional storm chaser " it was a wobbler			2
and it was big , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity233 said			0
" i think the left - hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles			2
" @entity241 , an anchor and meteorologist for @entity46 , felt the storm 's ferocity when it picked up his crew 's truck and tossed it 200 yards into a field			2
@entity241 said the incident , the most frightening moment of his life , unfolded in slow motion , " especially when we were floating ... i kind of felt like i was being lifted to heaven or something			0
" " i think this was just an erratic tornado			2
i think the size of it and the speed of it changed very , very quickly , " he told @entity0 on sunday			0
" i think the direction of movement changed quickly			0
and i think there were a lot of people out there that , you know , ended up getting stuck in positions we did n't want to be in			0
" @entity241 and his crew fared far better than @entity9 ' team			2
one member had a broken backbone , rib and breastbone , while the rest suffered scratches and bruises			0
in its april 2004 edition , @entity158 chronicled how @entity9 and his team drove directly into a tornado 's path at a moment 's notice			1
they used a van carrying six probes called turtles , which are 45 - pound metal disks resembling flying saucers			0
opinion : why we chase storms " through embedded sensors , the probes can measure a tornado 's wind speed and direction , barometric pressure , humidity , and temperature , " the magazine wrote			2
" @entity9 's mission , and his passion , is to plant them in the path of the funnel			1
his hope is that both he and the instruments survive			0
" the website for @entity104 , which stands for @entity309 in @entity310 , says @entity9 in june 2003 secured a pressure drop measurement in a violent @entity313 tornado that has never been matched			1
@entity9 had received 18 grants from the @entity158 for his research , said @entity316 , the organization 's executive vice president of missions			1
in a written statement , he described @entity9 ' studies of lightning as " pioneering			2
" " @entity9 was a courageous and brilliant scientist who fearlessly pursued tornadoes and lightning in the field in an effort to better understand these phenomena , " he said			2
their tornado - chasing work may sound like cowboy stuff , but the trio 's colleagues say they were professionals who operated with the utmost care			1
@entity0 's @entity233 , who also covered friday 's storm in @entity15 , said @entity9 was known for his attention to safety			1
" there 's just no one safer than @entity9 , he would never put himself in danger , " @entity233 said			1
" he certainly would n't put his son in danger			0
" @entity233 also emphasized that @entity9 was in an upper echelon among his forecasting and storm - chasing brethren			1
" we all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong			0
but i think to portray @entity9 as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing , " @entity233 said			1
" i just want people to know that @entity9 was a scientist			2
he was out there to put probes out there			0
he was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable			0
... we all go out there and we try to protect the public , but @entity9 was even one step higher			2
" @entity362 , a videographer who chases storms and calls himself the @entity364 , said the three men were more than storm chasers			0
" they 're researchers , " he said			0
" this thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community , " he said			0
" we knew this day would happen someday , but nobody would imagine that it would happen to @entity9 was one of the safest people to go out there			1
... he 's had close calls , but he 's always had an escape route			0
" " @entity11 " aired for five years on the @entity43			2
its last season was in the fall of 2011			0
the network expressed condolences in a statement sunday			0
" we are deeply saddened by the loss of @entity10 , @entity9 and his son			1
our thoughts and prayers go out to their families , " it said			0
@entity0 's @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 , @entity394 , @entity395 , @entity396 and @entity397 contributed to this report .			0

tornado chaser 's brother : " i just could n't ever think it would ever happen to him "
@entity9 and @entity11 and @entity10 were killed chasing a tornado on friday night
@entity11 , *budding* videographer , described as " quirky , fun , and just so easy going "
@entity10 worked on @entity111 crews until 2000 adventure in @entity121 changed his path
