the @entity71 striker bulleted in a powerful header from another @entity44 cross that keeper @entity62 could only deflect into his net			0
but @entity6 hit back seven minutes later when @entity28 picked himself off the floor following a goalmouth scramble to scoop a delightful flick over @entity62 and in off the crossbar			0
tensions boiled over in the 83rd minute when @entity79 appeared to catch @entity19 in the face with a flying arm , resulting in @entity82 racing in with a rash challenge on the @entity6 midfielder before confronting him			0
