as president @entity2 channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in @entity5 , he should n't be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed			1
one common refrain from those who plan to vote against the resolution to authorize military action in @entity5 is they simply ca n't support a proposal that their constituents vociferously oppose			1
" both in terms of the percentage opposed -- i would have to say it is by far the single biggest issue we have seen , " said rep. @entity17 , a @entity18 from @entity19			0
@entity17 represents all of @entity19 -- he is an " at large " member -- and he said that during the august recess he put 3,000 miles on his truck , crisscrossing the state and attending events that put him in close conversations with his constituents			2
at coffee hours , town halls , and meet and greets all over the state , @entity17 found that the sentiment was overwhelming : " i am hearing from the people of @entity19			0
they are telling me we should not be involved			0
" " it is called the people 's house for a reason , " @entity17 concluded			0
" we are here to express the voice of the people			0
this is an example of where @entity43 , hopefully , will express the will of the @entity47 people			0
" the number of " no " votes in @entity43 continues to grow , while lawmakers planning to vote " yes " are becoming an even smaller minority , according to @entity53 's latest vote count			1
there are currently 148 @entity56 members prepared to vote against @entity2 's call for military action -- with 30 democrats joining 118 @entity18 in their opposition			1
that overall number of " no " votes has grown from 109 on friday			1
in order to win passage of the authorization , @entity2 will have to persuade 270 members to vote " yes " -- a heavy lift , considering there are currently only 25 members who say they plan to vote " yes " on military action , 17 @entity58 and eight @entity18			1
the number of " yes " votes has only increased by two since friday			1
a @entity53 / @entity73 poll released monday shows that even though eight in 10 @entity47 believe that @entity75 's regime gassed its own people , a strong majority do n't want @entity43 to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it			2
since @entity2 unexpectedly asked @entity43 in august to authorize military action in @entity5 , polls have found that @entity47 are opposed to such action			1
the @entity84 has been more receptive than the @entity56 to @entity2 's authorization request			1
there are currently 25 " yes " and 23 " no " votes in the @entity84 , with a significant 52 senators undecided			2
but the trend favors the " no " votes -- with a handful of moderate @entity58 in the last three days coming out against the proposal			2
" after doing my due diligence , i believe we need an alternative path forward in dealing with the @entity75 regime , " said sen. @entity94 of @entity95 in a statement			0
" we must balance the legitimate concerns that @entity47 have about the use of military force with our strategic interests			2
" other @entity58 senators echoed @entity94 : @entity106 of @entity107 and @entity108 of @entity109			0
@entity106 issued a statement saturday saying @entity2 and his national security team had not yet made an effective case for taking action against @entity75 's regime and laying out the criteria that had to be met in order for him to support military action in @entity5			1
" based on the information presented to me and the evidence i have gathered , i do not believe these criteria have been met , " @entity106 said			0
@entity108 told people on a telephone town hall last week that he was a " probable no " on @entity5 authorization			0
" this has probably been the no. 1 issue , especially in the last week , that @entity109 have been contacting my office , as well as when i was back home for the last month , " @entity108 said			0
because of the possibility of a filibuster , @entity2 and supporters need 60 votes in the @entity84 to win passage			1
despite the vocal opposition and light support , majorities in both the @entity56 and @entity84 remain undecided on the proposal , and the @entity56 is putting on the hard sell to court those possible " yes " votes			2
the @entity84 is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its month - long summer recess monday			0
@entity56 officials will travel to @entity144 on tuesday to try to make their case with lawmakers , hours before @entity2 addresses the nation in a prime - time speech .			1

@entity150 who plan to vote against military action say their constituents oppose it
the number of those who plan to vote " no " grew significantly over the weekend
@entity2 will take his pitch to @entity144 on tuesday to try to find more " yes " votes
