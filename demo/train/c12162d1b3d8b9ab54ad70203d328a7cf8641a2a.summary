@entity0 -- a 15 - year - old girl goes to the clinic in her @entity0 high school -- perhaps confused , perhaps unprepared , perhaps scared that she may become pregnant			1
there she might get not only answers but the " morning - after , " or @entity7 , pill -- and not necessarily with her parent 's direct consent			1
that can happen thanks to the city 's pregnancy - prevention program dubbed @entity15 , best known by its acronym catch			1
its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in @entity0 annually , with 90 % of those pregnancies unplanned , according to the city 's health department			1
" we are committed to trying new approaches ... to improve a situation that can have negative consequences that last a lifetime , " the health department said in a statement			0
study : teen access to @entity7 uneven the program , which also allows for the distribution of condoms and birth control pills , began in january 2011			2
but it has gotten more attention of late , with most of it about the @entity7 pill			0
the @entity41 says the pill can be taken after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy , either by stopping the release of a female 's egg , stopping sperm from fertilizing an egg or preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb			1
its purpose is to prevent a pregnancy , not to end one			0
some city dwellers have praised the program , calling it a helpful tool to curb teen pregnancy			1
others , though , feel that it is a misguided and possibly dangerous intrusion into the lives of families and the authority of parents			0
@entity65 , the president of the recently formed @entity0 @entity66 , is firmly in the latter camp			0
she believes the city 's department of education and mayor @entity72 " have completely overstepped their bounds " by potentially affecting a child 's health without their parents ' direct knowledge			1
" what you 're doing is you 're giving a young child , between the age of 14 and 17 , a chemical drug and hormonal cocktail without the knowledge of the parent , not knowing the medical history or if that child has any kind of drug allergies , " @entity65 told @entity91 's " @entity90 , " noting teens ca n't get an aspirin in school " without informed consent " but could get the morning - after pill			1
in @entity0 , a person must be 18 or older to buy the pill over the counter			2
those younger than 18 must have a prescription			0
the program , which began in five schools and recently expanded to 13 , is not mandatory			0
parents can " opt out " by signing and returning a form to the school			1
the health department said recently , though , that only 1 % to 2 % of parents have done so			0
yet @entity65 , who has a teenage girl and a young boy , said , " most parents i 've spoken to " in schools involved in the program never got a letter from the city 's health or education departments , thus never opted out of the program			2
she 's not surprised , claiming that the city school system has long had " very poor outreach to parents			2
" still , some city residents -- parents and nonparents alike -- disagree with @entity65			0
at a time when half of teen mothers never graduate high school and 47 % of @entity129 high schoolers say they are sexually active , according to the @entity130 , they say that the more options teens have , the better			1
" kids are having kids , and that 's the end of their education , " said @entity132 , who said she wishes her daughter 's high school had the program			1
" once you have a kid , that 's the end of it , let 's be honest			0
" another woman , @entity145 , said the program was " not good , but it 's ok " -- especially if the alternative is a teenager having an illegal and possibly dangerous abortion after getting pregnant			0
" i think kids are going to get into trouble , so the least the school can ( do is ) help them out some , " @entity145 said			0
one @entity0 who strongly supports the program -- which , so far , has led to more than 1,100 students receiving birth control pills , including @entity7 , according to the health department -- is its mayor			1
asked about the program that went on quietly for an entire school year before receiving media attention , @entity72 told reporters that the program is " nothing new " and noted it was a pilot program			2
he pointed to progress in the city in lowering teen pregnancy rates , which he claims are down 25 % in the past decade			1
but the mayor said lowering those rates even further is important , given the personal and academic costs of teen pregnancy			1
" there ( are ) still an awful lot of girls who get pregnant at a very early age , when history shows its very difficult to raise a child and give the child the care it needs when the parent just is very young and has n't had the experience of adulthood , " @entity72 said			2
beyond that , the mayor said he was surprised that a program that 's been running quietly for nearly two full years was all of a sudden a source of controversy			2
" we 've been doing this for a long time , " he said			0
" there just is n't any big news story			0

fresh attention is *focused* on @entity0 program aimed at preventing teen pregnancy
high school girls can get the " morning - after " pill without their parent 's direct consent
a parent leader *blasts* the program and say most parents never got a form to opt out
but the mayor and others say such approaches are needed and the program is n't new
