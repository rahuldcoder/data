some of the plaintiffs led female troops who went on missions with combat infantrymen , according to the @entity15 , which is representing the women			1

@entity29 suffered shrapnel wounds , and she was later awarded the @entity36 and @entity37 with @entity38 , the @entity15 said			0
she returned to flying status within a week			0
despite that , the combat exclusion policy prevents her from seeking some combat leadership positions , the @entity15 said			1
an ied took a veteran 's leg , not her fighting spirit @entity29 said serving has very little to do with gender , and that the military 's policy is " an injustice to women who have come before us and who continue to put their lives on the line for their country			1
" she wanted to be an @entity59 pilot since she was a kid			0
" i have proven my ability every step of the way , " @entity29 said , according to a news release from the @entity15			0

another plaintiff was sent on similar missions in the @entity72 , accompanying combat troops in @entity4 , the @entity15 said			1

the military 's policy excludes women from more than 238,000 positions , according to the @entity15 , arguing that that situation prevents commanders from mobilizing their troops effectively			1
the @entity15 and others who represent the woman said the policy denies training and recognition for service , puts women at a disadvantage for promotions or moving up in rank and prevents them from competing for jobs that they 've shown they 're capable of			2
@entity6 spokesman @entity110 took questions about the suit tuesday , saying that he could n't comment about pending litigation , but he added that defense secretary @entity117 " remains very committed " to examining role of women in the military .			2
