lt. @entity0 flies missions close to @entity3 air space almost every day in his @entity4 , often encountering @entity3 military aircraft over the strategic waters of the @entity7			1
@entity0 's squadron , the @entity8 , are currently stationed aboard the @entity9 , a huge aircraft carrier whose presence in the region is testament to the escalating tensions between the @entity14 and @entity3			1
he says in almost all cases , the interaction between @entity4 and @entity3 pilots is professional -- they stay out of each other 's way			1
but he also knows , the @entity9 is here to make sure the @entity3 do n't overstep their boundaries			1
" we have a responsibility to our coalition partners and to the world just to help make sure that freedom of navigation is going along smoothly and that people can feel safe transiting international waters , " @entity0 said during a recent @entity22 visit to the carrier			2
he is referring to @entity3 's repeated threats to close the @entity7 as @entity33 steps up its defiance in response to international sanctions			1
any move to block the narrow waterway between @entity3 and @entity39 could affect 20 % of the world 's oil supply including 90 % of @entity43 's resurgent oil exports			1
" we 've heard the rhetoric about them possibly closing the @entity7 and we just remain vigilant as we come through , " said rear admiral @entity44 , who led a carrier strike group that this week escorted the @entity9 as the carrier on its second passage through the @entity7 this year			1
@entity44 says his crew takes care not to provoke @entity3 through its maneuvering , but at the same is prepared to answer any military escalation by @entity3 's navy			2
the @entity55 believes any attempt by @entity3 to shut down the @entity7 waterway might involve missile or sea mine attacks on merchant vessels			1
" it does n't take many mines to be effective , to have an effect , " @entity44 said			0
" there is a potential to do that and we are prepared to monitor it and respond with capabilities that are in theater			0
" the @entity70 says it is ready to counter threats in the @entity72			0
and aboard the @entity9 , the crew works round the clock to ensure the carrier is always capable of launching its aircraft			1
a massive arsenal stores millions of pounds of laser and gps - guided ordnance			0
several maintenance decks in the ship 's hull can conduct almost any maintenance required , from electronics to engine repairs			0
a crew of the dozens of people needed to get a plane into the air are always on standby			0
among these , the so - called " shooter " is in charge of operations on deck and gives the final go for the fighters to take off			0
shooters are also responsible for monitoring the pressure of the massive steam - powered catapults that propel the planes from 0 - 160 miles an hour in about 2 seconds			0
too much and the plane could get torn apart , too little and it would stall and crash into the water			0
" we can launch four aircraft in about a minute , then we takes a few minutes to re load the catapults and get next batch of aircraft into position , " said @entity105			2
@entity113 , one of the shooters			0
most crew members do n't talk directly about the potential @entity3 threat in the region and will only say they are prepared to deal with anything that comes up			2
the commander of the @entity9 , @entity120			2
@entity121 , says the vast majority of encounters with the @entity124 are routine and professional , with ships or planes monitoring the carrier or trying to establish radio contact for routine queries			0
nevertheless , @entity3 's fleet , though old and equipped with only small surface vessels and submarines , can pose a danger even to a super carrier			2
" they have small boats , they have bigger boats , they have submarines , they have pretty much the gambit of things , " @entity121 says			0
the @entity70 speaks of scenarios in which @entity3 could launch sudden , almost insurgent style attacks on larger , better - equipped @entity4 warships			1
so far , however , that has not happened and there were no major incidents during @entity9 's recent passage through the @entity7			1
the carrier is now on its way to new mission to support @entity153 forces in @entity154 , but as international concerns over @entity3 persist , @entity55 's presence in the @entity72 will remain .			1

@entity4 pilots say they have had daily encounters with @entity3 aircraft over @entity7
