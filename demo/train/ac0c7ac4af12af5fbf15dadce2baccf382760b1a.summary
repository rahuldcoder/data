-- what will president @entity2 's historical legacy look like decades from now ? as the media sort through the debates over the @entity7 and the budget , or the implications of the recent deal with @entity11 , many @entity4 are starting to think about how we will remember this president			1
predicting presidential legacies is tricky			0
historians are particularly skeptical about anyone who thinks he or she can figure out what a president 's legacy will be while he 's still in office			1
why is this ? the next president has a big role to play in how a president goes down in the record books			2
whoever succeeds president @entity2 can help to legitimize or undercut the programs that have been put into place since 2009			1
when @entity32 president @entity31 allowed most of @entity34 's @entity33 to stand , it helped make those policies — and @entity34 's domestic legacy — a permanent part of the political landscape			1
the same had been true during the 1950s , when @entity39 opposed efforts to roll back the @entity41			0
in recent years , president @entity2 's decision to accept and expand many of president @entity44 's counterterrorism programs normalized a series of policies that had been highly controversial			1
the success or failure of implementing a president 's programs can have huge consequences over the long term when we think about what a president did			1
the short - term struggles over a policy , such as we are now seeing with the @entity7 , do n't matter as much as we might think			2
many popular programs , including @entity60 , started on shaky ground			0
but if policymakers can entrench a program , as occurred with @entity60 by the 1950s , then the president who first proposed them looks pretty good			1
the success of @entity60 remains integral to @entity68 's legacy			1
similarly , over time the success of @entity70 and @entity71 has made it increasingly apparent that @entity73 often overshadowed the massive domestic accomplishments of @entity34			0
according to a recent @entity0 / @entity76 , a majority of @entity4 remain open - minded about the @entity7 and believe that it will be fixed			0
if the regulations start to curb premiums and millions of other @entity4 have health insurance for the first time , @entity7 , and president @entity2 , will look much better			1
future events also will determine how we consider the legacy of a president			1
the interim deal the @entity2 administration and five other world powers reached with @entity11 , for instance , wo n't make much sense until we see how tensions in the region unfold and what exactly comes of @entity11 's nuclear power			1
president @entity95 's decision to negotiate with the @entity96 over intermediate range missiles between 1985 and 1987 could only be assessed after the collapse of the @entity96 in 1991			1
the negotiations are now considered to be a crowning achievement of the @entity95 presidency , though at the time they were highly controversial , including among conservatives who distrusted @entity104			0
president @entity106 's economic policies look much better to many @entity107 and @entity32 in light of the frail economic conditions of the early 21st century			2
in contrast , the tepid response of the @entity4 government to @entity113 refugees fleeing from @entity114 in the 1930s remains one of the worst moments in @entity68 's record			2
finally , there is no such thing as a fixed presidential legacy			2
historians have seen how presidential reputations have changed dramatically over time			0
@entity125 left office as one of the most unpopular presidents of the time			0
he now comes out on the top of most lists of best presidents			0
what 's more , the opening of presidential archives can often give historians a very different impression of how a president performed			1
@entity4 also assess their presidents through the lens of the political era in which they live			0
during the 1980s , a conservative age , there was a more favorable view of @entity39			0
in recent years , after politics swung toward the liberal side of the spectrum , @entity34 received a second look			0
and presidents themselves have been playing a bigger and more active role in shaping the debate about what they did in the @entity154			0
although presidents ca n't help but think about how they will be treated in the history books , gaming the future is impossible			1
indeed , that future will never be set in stone			2
what presidents can best control are the programs in front of them , making sure that things are working well and that they put into place an infrastructure of policies that has the best chance of outlasting their time in @entity172			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 : one ca n't predict sitting president 's legacy . much depends on what comes after
whether next president lets previous president 's *signature* program stand affects legacy
he says @entity2 kept some @entity44 counterterror initiatives . @entity31 kept @entity189
@entity175 : archives can affect understanding of legacy , as can future world events
