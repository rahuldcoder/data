the hunt is on for @entity2 , the 26 - year - old woman wanted over thursday 's fatal shooting of a @entity6 policewoman			1
early reports suggested she might have escaped friday from a kosher grocery store in eastern @entity10 as @entity6 authorities mounted a rescue operation to free hostages being held there by @entity15 , believed to be her boyfriend			1
however , @entity1 reports that no witness has publicly said the woman was actually at the scene of the siege , and now sources are saying she left @entity6 before the attack on the policewoman			1
@entity2 is believed to have left @entity6 for @entity23 around january 2 with the final destination of @entity25 , according to @entity6 and @entity23 sources			1
regardless , photographs of @entity2 published by @entity28 show her shooting what appears to be a crossbow in an all - enveloping black niqab			2
at first glance , this might appear puzzling			2
after all , jihadist militant organizations support @entity37 - style rule , which allows women only a role at home			1
however , we have seen a number of women from the @entity44 , including @entity46 citizens , taking an operational role in jihadist terrorist plots , including @entity49 , a caucasian - american 46 - year - old from @entity51 , known as " @entity49 , " who traveled to @entity53 in 2009 to scope out an attack on @entity55 , a @entity56 artist who had drawn a cartoon of the @entity59 's head on the body of a dog			1
@entity53 women have also played an operational role in jihadist terrorism			1
@entity65 , a 38 - year - old @entity66 woman , died when she committed a suicide bombing in @entity68 in 2005			2
and on may 14 , 2010 , @entity69 , a 21 - year - old @entity70 woman , stabbed @entity71 , her local member of @entity72 , for his vote in support of the @entity75			2
and there is also 31 - year - old @entity70 citizen @entity78 , who is , according to @entity79 , " wanted by @entity80 on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to december 2011			2
" the @entity80 believe she was part of a terrorist cell that was planning to carry out an attack in @entity80			2
@entity78 is the widow of one of the suicide attackers who set off bombs on @entity93 's transportation system on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 commuters			0
all this underscores that the phenomenon of females joining the jihad has become far more common in the past four years , fueled by the @entity25 war , which is drawing an unprecedented number of foreign militants from around the globe , including from the @entity44			0
according to data collected by @entity104 , based on media reports and court documents , of the 455 individuals who have been publicly identified from around the world who have traveled or were arrested while attempting to travel to @entity25 to fight with a terrorist organization , 36 were women from the @entity44			1
and their average age is , astonishingly , only 18 years			0
they hail from countries from around the @entity44 : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity66 , @entity6 , @entity118 , the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity70 and the @entity46			0
and in many cases , these @entity122 women are often going to @entity25 with the fantasy that there they will be able to marry the jihadist militant of their dreams			1
several of these aspiring jihadist brides are @entity46			1
in october , three teenage girls from @entity131 were intercepted at @entity132 in @entity118 as they were trying to make their way to @entity25 to join @entity134			0
their parents tipped off the @entity136 when they went missing			0
another @entity131 resident , 19 - year - old @entity137 , was arrested at @entity138 before she departed on her journey to join an @entity134 camp near the @entity23 - @entity25 border			0
she planned to marry a member of @entity134 whom she had met online			0
she pleaded guilty in september			0
another girl , the 17 - year - old sister of @entity146 - based @entity145 , was allegedly planning to travel with her brother to @entity23 and from there to join @entity134			0
she and her brother were arrested at @entity146 's @entity149 in october			0
@entity145 faces up to 15 years in prison for trying to provide " material support " in the shape of his own services to @entity134 , while his sister , who is not being named by the government , is a minor and likely wo n't be charged			0
finally , there 's @entity157 , a @entity158 resident who left her 18 - year - old daughter behind to join rebel forces in @entity25			0
she died in may 2013 fighting , reportedly , with one of the many jihadist militant groups fighting there			1
it 's a strange kind of jihadist female equal opportunity : you too can be part of the holy war that seeks to install a @entity37 - style utopia that will ensure you can never have a job or get an education .			1
