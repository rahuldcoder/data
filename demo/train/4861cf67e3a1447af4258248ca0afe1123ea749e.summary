@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has again opened the dispute over sovereignty of the @entity6 in the @entity7 , accusing the @entity9 government of blatant colonialism			1
known to the @entity11 as @entity6 , the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then military government in @entity11 landed troops on the islands			1
in an open letter to @entity9 prime minister @entity20 and published in @entity9 newspapers thursday , the @entity11 leader said " @entity9 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity11 , thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity			1
" the @entity9 government was swift to respond , insisting that there would be no discussions over sovereignty " unless and until such as the time as the islanders so wish			2
" it is the latest in a recent series of incidents that has raised tensions between the two countries			0
what led to the latest dispute ? the @entity11 president has raised the sovereignty issue several times over the last two years , including a claim at the @entity41 , but the dispute made global headlines when prince @entity44 , second in line to the @entity9 throne , was deployed on a military mission to the islands in 2012			1
the @entity9 also decided to dispatch the new warship @entity50 to the @entity6 -- a move that inflamed anger in @entity11 which accused @entity9 of militarizing the @entity7			1
tensions were raised again in december when the @entity9 renamed a portion of the @entity56 as @entity57 in honor of the @entity9 head of state @entity59 also has a claim on some of the territory and lodged a protest with the @entity9			2
last year also saw a public confrontation between the two countries ' leaders when @entity67 tried to hand a letter to @entity20 at the @entity69 -- a letter he refused to accept -- and there was more bad feeling between the nations ahead of the @entity73 when @entity11 released a video boosting its @entity76 team that was filmed on the islands			1
where are the @entity6 and why are they important ? located in the @entity79 , about 480 kilometers east of the tip of @entity81 , the windswept @entity6 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources			1
their remoteness , however , exposed them to neglect and complex wrangling over ownership among @entity9 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity11 interests			1
@entity11 's forerunners formally declared possession in 1820 , prompting @entity9 to reclaim a sovereignty it originally declared in 1765			1
falklands conflict in photos despite regular challenges , notably in 1982 , @entity9 control has endured and the @entity6 ' current population of about 3,000 looks to @entity0 to safeguard oil , fishing , farming and tourism incomes			1
what happened in 1982 ? documents recently revealed under the @entity9 's 30 - year rule show that the @entity9 government was surprised by the @entity11 invasion of the islands on april 2 , 1982 , with the then @entity9 prime minister @entity112 describing it as " the worst ... moment of my life			1
" in evidence given to the @entity116 in october 1982 , and some months after the war ended , @entity112 said there were no warning signs from @entity11 since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks			2
" i never , never expected the @entity11 to invade the @entity6 head - on , " she told the committee			1
" it was such a stupid thing to do , as events happened , such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing			0
" the files also show that @entity112 's @entity130 was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then @entity135 secretary of state @entity134 , while also preparing a military response			0
@entity9 naval forces were dispatched after @entity11 president @entity139 's military dictatorship put troops on the @entity6			1
soldiers fought land battles on the islands , aircraft were shot down and ships were attacked with significant losses of life -- most notably the @entity11 @entity149 and @entity9 's @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity148			1
@entity9 declared an end to fighting after 74 days and following the surrender of @entity11 troops			1
@entity11 put its death toll at 645			2
@entity9 's civil and military losses amounted to 255			2
how did the @entity135 and other world powers react ? president @entity159 's administration declared economic sanctions against @entity11			0
it also gave its @entity163 ally a strategic edge by supplying potent @entity166 missiles to counter @entity11 's @entity167			2
at the height of the conflict , a meeting of the world 's biggest economies -- including the @entity9 , @entity135 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity91 , @entity175 and @entity176 -- backed @entity9 's position			0
why wo n't the @entity9 give up the islands like it did @entity179 ? @entity9 acknowledges its claim to the @entity6 is disputed , but has made clear it has no intention of discussing the sovereignty issue with @entity11			1
professor @entity183 , an expert in maritime territorial disputes at @entity186 's @entity185 , said last year that there was no comparison to @entity179 , which @entity9 returned to @entity190 control after expiry of a set lease in 1997			0
" the @entity9 position on the @entity6 is that they are under @entity9 sovereignty -- they are not leased from anyone , " he said			1
what has happened to the islands since the end of the war in 1982 ? spurred by the conflict and stung by accusations of neglect , @entity9 began taking renewed economic interest in the @entity6			1
it protected fishing rights and asserted control over oil exploration licenses			0
it also stepped up its military interests , building a new airfield and bolstering naval , army and air force presences			0
images of life in the @entity6 cooperation between @entity9 and @entity11 -- by now an established democracy whose militarist past has left current leaders distrustful of its armed forces -- has improved , but @entity219 continued to reject any territorial claim to @entity6 other than its own			1
the @entity6 are due to hold a referendum on their political status on march 10/11 , 2013			0
according to the @entity6 legislative assembly , the vote is intended to affirm islanders ' desire to remain a self - governing territory of the @entity9 and to reject claims of ownership by @entity11			1
so why is the language between @entity0 and @entity219 so tense now ? analysts have previously pointed to @entity11 politicians seeking to divert voters from the pain caused by inflation and reduced subsidies on oil , gas and electricity			0
" the government is being squeezed from lots of different areas , so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the @entity6 issue , " professor @entity242 , an expert in @entity244 politics at @entity245 in @entity246 said last year			0
" it 's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on			0
" in the @entity9 , @entity20 -- a successor to @entity112 as leader of the @entity261 -- must be seen to defend the principles of his predecessor who mobilized troops to reclaim the islands			2
@entity9 @entity6 conflict veteran @entity267 said : " it 's not about asserting a claim , it 's about allowing people of the @entity6 to have the right to self - determination			1
" what has @entity11 done to bolster its claims ? regional allies were recruited to the cause at the end of 2011 , with members of the @entity81 @entity279 trading bloc uniting to ban @entity6 - flagged vessels from their ports			1
this is largely " diplomatic dressing " that will do little to isolate the islands , professor @entity285 , who heads the @entity244 program at @entity287 in @entity288 , said last year			0
is this really all about oil ? partly			0
there is @entity11 resentment of a @entity9 oil exploration project launched off the @entity6 in 2010			1
this has been worsened by @entity11 's recent relegation from exporter to net importer of hydrocarbons			0
analysts , however , insist this remains a sideshow to the political traction offered by the @entity6 dispute			0
how much oil is there ? press reports say up to 8.3 billion barrels of undersea oil reserves could lie in the @entity6 economic zone -- a radius of 320 - kilometers around the islands , but despite successful drilling , this quantity is still speculative			2
the figures are backed by claims from small oil ventures , including @entity317 and @entity318 & @entity319 , which are hoping to raise capital for further exploration in fields licensed by the islands ' @entity9 - backed government			2
attempts to attract investment in the projects has been hampered by the @entity3 dispute			0
many major oil firms have interests in @entity11 and are wary of upsetting @entity219 by involving themselves in the @entity6			1
also a problem is the considerable cost of extracting deep water reserves from the remote @entity7			0
professor @entity335 , a petroleum economics expert at the @entity336 , described the @entity6 oil reserve estimates as " optimistic , " adding that even if they are proven , the cost of exploiting them could still be prohibitive			0
" it 's one thing doing exploration , but when you come to development , we 're talking about bigger volumes of materials and to get that there is expensive because at the moment there 's nothing there -- just sheep farmers , " he said			0
" it will take a few 100 million barrels to make it worth it , and there 's a number of ifs and buts before we get there			0
" is conflict likely again ? no , say analysts			0
while there are parallels with the 1980s -- politicians using @entity368 - @entity11 tensions to court votes and divert from economic woes at home -- there is little appetite for conflict on either side			0
any action is likely to remain in the diplomatic sphere			0
a former senior @entity9 military officer said in early 2012 that @entity9 military cutbacks had left @entity9 unprepared for another @entity6 conflict			2
@entity11 is apparently in a similar state , with a heavily depleted military that experts say would be no match even for @entity9 's depleted force			2
" even if @entity11 wanted to go to war , they have no military capacity , " @entity242 said			0
he said @entity67 's own antipathy towards the military -- a legacy of her political opposition to @entity11 's former dictatorship -- meant she would be unlikely to support even a maritime blockade of @entity9 vessels .			2

several countries have disputed @entity6 ownership since first recorded *landfall* *in17th* century
islands have been coveted as strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of resources
@entity11 and @entity9 fought over the islands in 1982
more recently , the @entity11 have accused the @entity9 of blatant colonialism
