-- as a group of tourists was passing through the villages of @entity5 and @entity6 in the north east of @entity8 last month , they caught glimpse of something that immediately sent them reaching for their cameras			1
strolling through the meadows near the densely forested @entity14 were three magnificent @entity16 bison , standing up to two meters high and weighing up to 1,000 kilograms each			1
it was a doubly gratifying sight for @entity18 , a conservationist and the director of the @entity20 at the @entity21 , who enjoyed seeing the tourists as much as the bison			0
@entity25 's largest land mammal had been declared extinct in the wild at the end of the 1920s , but after spirited and careful re-introduction efforts throughout the past 60 years , descendants of a small captive herd have gradually reassumed their position among @entity8 's vibrant indigenous fauna			1
the tourists , meanwhile , were training only their lenses on the animals and not the viewfinders of a shotgun , proving to @entity18 that the creatures could bring visitors to @entity8 for reasons other than to hunt them			1
" it really increases the touristic attraction of the area , " said @entity18 , who co-ordinated one of several bison conservation programs between 2006 and 2010			2
" this is a unique animal , a kind of relic of the past because most of these large herbivores have become extinct			2
there are fewer @entity16 bison than the black rhino in @entity56 , for example			1
" back from the brink @entity16 bison , also known as " wisent " , roamed freely across the continent until the early 20th century , when a combination of factors including a shrinking habitat and poaching left only 54 individuals in captivity , according to a recent report commissioned by the @entity25 initiative			1
but since 1959 small populations have been introduced in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , but most successfully in @entity8 where there are now 1,299 closely monitored , free - roaming individuals in small herds			1
the @entity16 bison spent several years classified as " endangered " on the @entity81 published by the @entity82 of the @entity83			1
but recent population trends have increased annually by around 15 % , earning the bison an upgrade to " vulnerable "			2
the animal is far from out of the woods yet , but there is reason for cautious optimism			0
conservationists regard bison as a so - called " umbrella species " , whose well - being also tends to ensure a positive habitat for many other treasured creatures including moose , wolf and lynx , plus various bird and insect species			0
read more : @entity8 's little - known heritage sites in attempts to broaden the genetic diversity among bison -- all of @entity8 's bison descend from those 54 captive animals that survived " extinction " -- scientists have created migration channels to facilitate the interbreeding of herds			1
locals residents have also been educated about the animals habits and the perceived damage caused by the bison to young trees , or when they stray into agricultural land			2
the principal concerns now are centered on controlling the bison population , ensuring herds do not become too large for the areas of land they occupy			1
natural mortality among bison is low and the space they demand vast ; five bison per 1,000 hectares of land is deemed the optimal density			0
some culling of old , sick or unusually aggressive creatures has therefore become necessary , but the process is controversial , particularly since the @entity8 @entity136 has recently allowed commercial hunters to take part			2
hunting as a conservation measure ? @entity140 is not a game animal in @entity8 , meaning specific permission must be sought in order to kill one			1
but a small number of permits are now being issued annually to commercial agencies , providing the chance for hunters from anywhere in the world to add this rare beast to their trophy collections at a cost of up to $ 30,000 per animal			0
" rather than have him ( a bison selected to be culled ) killed in a fight or smashed through a fence and injured , they simply allow him to be hunted , " said @entity156 , president and founder of the @entity159 , who arranges overseas trips for hunters from the company headquarters in @entity163			0
" that brings money into the reserve and into the conservation system and it prevents wanton waste			0
" @entity156 added : " about 70 % of money that goes into wildlife conservation nowadays comes from the sustainable use community			0
that means hunters and fishermen			0
" dr @entity180 , of the @entity181 , is a member of a commission -- alongside veterinarians , ecologists and scientists -- that discusses the number of hunting permits to issue each year and decides on the individual bison to be removed			2
she said that the process is strictly regulated , with a hunter being escorted by a forest ranger , pointed to the one animal he is allowed to shoot and only permitted to fire when it is alone			0
" everything is organized , " said @entity180			0
" this kind of hunting involves 20 , maybe 25 animals per year in @entity8			1
" but @entity18 does not believe that the animals are plentiful enough in @entity8 for even this carefully regulated hunting to take place			1
" this culling or hunting is occurring in some populations that number below 100 individuals , " he said			0
he suggests that the bison might be better suited to life on the plains and out of the forests , which would not place an artificial limit on population numbers			0
" there is huge potential for bison increase in many areas and i 'm quite sure that culling or hunting is not a good way to mitigate conflicts			0

@entity16 bison have been successfully *reintroduced* to @entity8
animal was declared extinct in the country in the 1920s
around 1,200 animals are closely monitored by conservation groups
controlling population is now an issue with hunting a controversial *proposal*
