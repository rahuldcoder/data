-- @entity3 authorities on saturday evening arrested two convicted murderers who had been on the lam after being released from prison with forged documents , a state agency said			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were taken into custody " without incident " at 6:40 p.m. at @entity12 's @entity11 , the @entity13 said			1
members of that agency and the @entity18 found and detained the two men , the agency said			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are expected to appear in court sunday morning at the @entity21 in @entity12			1
the state @entity22 -- which mistakenly released the men though it has insisted through no fault of its own -- said little about the arrests			2
" we are , of course , happy they have been taken into custody , " agency spokeswoman @entity27 said			0
authorities have been searching for @entity8 and @entity9 , both 34 , after investigators discovered forged motions to reduce their respective sentences and forged court orders granting the requests			1
earlier saturday , family members of both men appealed for them to turn themselves in to authorities			1
" we just want you to surrender yourself to someone you trust who will bring you back in safely , " @entity8 's mother , @entity40 , said at a news conference outside the @entity42 in @entity43			2
@entity48 ' uncle , @entity47 , also urged the men to give their families some peace			2
both families denied any knowledge in the escape plan , telling investigators and reporters they first learned of the releases in telephone calls from the @entity59 with news they could pick up their family member			2
@entity40 appears to have questioned the call , telephoning the prison twice to make sure it was legitimate			2
" the family believed their prayers had been answered , " a spokeswoman for @entity40 said			2
the two men , according to family members , disappeared shortly after their return			1
in september 1998 , @entity9 killed @entity72 during a home - invasion robbery attempt			1
six months later , @entity74 was gunned down on an @entity43 street corner -- shot dead , a jury determined , by @entity8			2
both killers were convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crime			0
while it 's not known whether they knew each other , they were at the same prison in @entity87 in @entity3 's @entity88			1
@entity9 left there on september 27 , and @entity8 left on october 8 , according to authorities			1
they had motions indicating the sentences had been reduced as well as court orders granting the request			0
investigators later discovered these documents were forged			0
the legal - looking documents contained bogus reproductions of several key players ' signatures , including those of the @entity43 - area state attorney @entity103 or the assistant state attorney and judge @entity105			0
they bore the seal of the @entity108 clerk of court 's office			0
@entity105 told @entity0 his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high - profile trial of @entity114			0
@entity115 was acquitted in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity114			0
" people , particularly people with criminal minds , come up with ingenious ways to beat the system , " @entity105 said			0
" they have nothing but time on their hands to think of things			0
" prosecutors first learned about what happened after a member of @entity8 's family contacted them , @entity103 said			1
an october 8 letter from the @entity22 to @entity74 's mother , @entity131 , notified her a " court order and amended sentence caused ( @entity8 's ) sentence to expire			1
" " please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control			0
nevertheless , we apologize for the delay in this message , " it said			0
both @entity8 and @entity9 appeared to play by the rules after their release			1
they both went to the @entity108 jail to register as felons -- jenkins on september 30 , @entity8 on october 11 -- as required by law			1
while their releases may have initially seemed legitimate , the two convicts later were classified as escapees			0
@entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
