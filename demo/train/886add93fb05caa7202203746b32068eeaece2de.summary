police who arrested @entity12 on september 1 at the @entity13 were acting on an @entity15 alert that he was wanted on allegations of money laundering and running a phone - scam operation in @entity19 , said embassy spokesman @entity20			1

he also could face a six - month jail sentence if convicted , they said			0
@entity12 was about to leave @entity3 with his pregnant wife when he was arrested , said @entity28 of @entity22 's defense team			1

a cousin of @entity12 's wife also overstayed but was allowed to leave @entity3 after paying a fine , @entity28 said			1
if convicted , @entity22 would be caned unless he could provided a medical reason otherwise			0

the @entity2 @entity86 in @entity3 is closely monitoring @entity22 's case , @entity40 said			2
