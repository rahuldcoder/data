@entity0 -- it 's a well known part of @entity0 urban lore that an apartment where a violent death took place can often be bought for as much as 10 - 30 per cent off the market price			1
depending on the type of death -- suicide , natural death or gruesome murder -- the house will become more or less hongza ; a @entity16 term that literally translates as " calamity house " but effectively means the house is haunted			2
less well known is that secretive databases that collate hongza addresses are playing on local superstitions to effectively control prices in one of the world 's most expensive real estate markets			1
the problem with hongza is that it spreads			0
not only will a violent murder affect the price of the apartment where it took place , it will likely slash thousands off neighboring apartments -- and even the whole building			1
" databases do n't specify which apartments , data is incomplete : if an apartment has 30 or 40 storeys there 's a high probability all will be affected , " said @entity36 , sales director at @entity37			1
published information might specify the floor , but not the apartment where the death occurred			1
in some cases , only the building 's address appears			0
" i think they should make it clear , they should not just state the entire floor as haunted , " @entity53 , whose flat is listed on the same floor as a hongza apartment , told @entity1			2
@entity61 slums highlight @entity0 's wealth divide once a property is listed on a database , however , there 's no way out , says @entity67			1
owners have little recourse in getting their properties removed from hongza lists			2
meanwhile , the more than 5,000 real estate practitioners in the city , according to figures from the @entity76 real estate agents , are bound to keep tabs on hongza properties following a 2004 court decision making it compulsory for estate agents to report houses with a dark history			1
the case found against @entity85 , one of @entity0 's best - known real estate agencies , after a buyer pulled out of a transaction in 2001 when he discovered the apartment he planned to buy was hongza			1
" if an estate agent acting for a purchaser knows , or ought to have known of the occurrence of a tragic incident in a property , and knew or ought reasonably to have known that this would materially affect the value of the property , that agent would owe a duty to alert its client to that fact , " judge @entity92 said in the judgment which also acknowledged that property values could be reduced ' between 25 to 30 % ' in the case of a murder or suicide in a flat			2
the agency was ordered to pay almost $ 40,000 as a result of failing to " obtain information in relation to the properties , " judge @entity92 wrote in his decision			0
this information is now supplied by unaccountable databases that have no oversight into how the lists are compiled			1
repeated attempts by @entity1 to reach the most widely used information website , hk - compass.com , were unsuccessful			2
the page does not display the names of its managers			0
@entity0 's hot market in ' haunted ' houses its contacts are listed behind @entity128 with phone numbers under a @entity131 country code			1
@entity135 supplies an identification service , but does not run the website , one of its employees told @entity1 in a phone interview			0
website hk - compass.com sells hongza data to realtors for about $ 42 a year , according to the price list on the site			2
" we can only report the case to the authorities , we ca n't do anything because we do n't know who is behind this , " said @entity144 , president of the @entity145			0
meanwhile , @entity153 says , authorities have shown little enthusiasm for tackling a problem that is costing @entity0 homeowners millions of dollars			1
" we have contacted the @entity158 , but there 's no action , " @entity153 said , adding that he could only urge property owners to contact @entity161 - him , a @entity0 lawmaker who represents realtors on @entity0 's professional constituency government			1
repeated interview requests with @entity161 were ignored and attempts to speak with the @entity166 were declined			0
for one disgruntled property owner , who asked to only be identified as mr @entity170 due to the stigma associated with owning a cursed home , the solution to the problem is simple			0
" i think the government could regulate the website so that the addresses on it are more detailed , " he said			0
@entity179 , another hongza database , had 3438 entries in their database , as of october 2012 , the company told @entity1			0
in some cases , only street addresses are listed , information that could effectively depreciate the value of whole buildings			0
the final number of property owners affected by a hongza listing is impossible to estimate and , with huge fortunes won or lost in one of the region 's most volatile property markets , few want to talk about it			2
" the government will try not to do something they do n't think they can handle right now , " said @entity197 , professor at the @entity198 and @entity199 of the @entity200			0
@entity205 and @entity204 contributed to this report			0

in @entity0 , an apartment where a violent death has occurred can take 10 - 30 per cent off its market price
databases that track these incidents sell their services to real estate agents
owners complain that once their apartments appear on these lists , there 's no way to change the information
a violent death in an apartment often affects the resale value of other homeowners on the same floor
