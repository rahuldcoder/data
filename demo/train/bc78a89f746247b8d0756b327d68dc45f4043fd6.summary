-- the @entity1 , the group that told women in their 40s that they do n't need mammograms , will recommend that men not get screened for prostate cancer , according to a source privy to the task force deliberations			1
the task force is set to recommend a " d " rating for prostate specific antigen , or @entity12 , testing			1
such a rating means " there is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits , " according to the group 's website			0
the task force is set to propose this recommendation tuesday , and then allow for a comment period before issuing a final recommendation			0
according to a draft copy of a report released friday , a review of studies shows screening with the @entity12 blood test results in " small or no reduction " in prostate cancer deaths			1
the report adds that @entity12 testing is " associated with harms related to subsequent evaluation and treatments			2
" the @entity12 test , which is sometimes accompanied by a digital rectal exam , can help determine if a man has prostate cancer			1
the problem is that many of the cancers that get detected are so small and slow - growing , they 'll never be harmful , and doctors have a difficult time discerning the quick , harmful cancers from the slow , harmless ones			0
empowered patient : what 's a dude to do ? if you test 100 men over age 50 , 17 of them will have prostate cancer , and only three of those will have a fast - growing cancer and die of the disease , according to dr. @entity61 , senior author of the paper			1
if the 14 men with the slow - growing cancers are treated , they could be rendered impotent or incontinent from the treatment ; or worse , the treatment could kill them			0
about one in 500 men who has a radical prostatectomy will die because of complications of the surgery , according to @entity61			0
some prostate cancer patients were disappointed with the task force 's decision			1
a spokesman for the @entity75 called the proposed recommendation " a tremendous mistake			1
" " you 're talking to someone whose life was saved by [ the @entity12 test ] , " @entity78 said			0
but @entity61 says he believes testing does more harm than good			1
" maybe you should get tested if you have this horrible family history where everyone gets prostate cancer before the age of 50			2
but for most men , testing is harmful , " he said			0
until last year , @entity61 worked with the @entity1 as a medical officer for the @entity91			2
he says the task force voted in 2009 to give @entity12 screening a " d " rating , but it did n't announce it because of the uproar over the mammogram recommendation			2
" i was so frustrated with the political interference , and this was the final straw , " said @entity61 , who left the group in november and is now an assistant professor of family medicine at @entity99			0
@entity0 's @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .			0
