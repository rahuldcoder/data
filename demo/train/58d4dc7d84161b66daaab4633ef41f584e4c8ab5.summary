-- @entity1 is n't happy with the new airline price advertising rule			1
the big " warning ! " sign popping up on the carrier 's website makes that pretty clear			0
the message : " new government regulations require us to hide taxes in your fares			1
this is not consumer friendly or in your best interest			0
it 's wrong and you should n't stand for it			1
" the rule , which requires airlines to roll mandatory per - passenger taxes and fees into the advertised fare , went into effect this week as part of a new package of @entity29 airline passenger protections			1
before the rule , airlines could advertise the base fare or show it on the first screen of online fare results , adding taxes and fees later in the shopping process			1
opinion : truth in advertising is the best policy sen. @entity40 , @entity41 , called @entity1 's message to customers a " deliberate attempt to deceive the flying public " in a letter thursday to spirit ceo @entity46 , urging him to take the warning off the airline 's website and clarify its message to consumers			1
@entity1 is disappointed by the letter , said spokeswoman @entity52			2
" we would normally expect senators to encourage ( @entity57 ) amendment protection , " @entity52 said via e-mail			0
" we have always shown taxes before someone purchased			0
they now want them hidden			0
it is wrong and we will fight for consumers , " @entity52 said			0
spirit 's online message encourages customers to contact lawmakers to oppose the rule			1
@entity40 's office is n't buying the airline 's @entity71 argument			1
" @entity1 seems to think it has a @entity71 right to deliberately mislead its own customers			2
i 'm not sure that 's what our founding fathers had in mind , " said @entity75 spokesman @entity75 , noting that the @entity29 has fined @entity1 in the past for deceptive price advertising			2
the @entity83 , a group advocating for transparency , calls @entity1 's message " a disgraceful lie " employing " over-the - top fear tactics			1
" opinion : new rules make airfare seem higher in messages to consumers , @entity1 said the government has a " hidden agenda " to increase taxes			2
the @entity98 administration has proposed raising air travel taxes , which the @entity29 says is unrelated to the new regulation			0
" we are simply requiring airlines to post the full fare , and we leave it to them to break it down if they want , " @entity29 spokesman @entity101 said			2
spirit is not the only airline that objected to the new regulations			0
spirit , @entity111 and @entity112 have all made legal appeals to have the price advertising rule overturned			0
@entity111 said the rule singles out airlines			2
" our main objection ... is that there is no justification for treating air travel differently from just about everything else that consumers purchase , i.e. they pay for the price of goods and services and then pay tax			0
and that 's how everything is advertised , as the price of the item separately from the tax on that price , " @entity111 spokeswoman @entity127 told @entity0 last month			0
@entity111 's message to passengers about the new rule takes a different tack , explaining the changes and assuring consumers that while fares look higher , the airline and subsidiary @entity141 have not raised fares .			1

airline to customers : fare rule " wrong and you should n't stand for it "
sen. @entity40 and advocacy group call @entity1 's message *deceitful*
rule requires airlines to roll mandatory taxes and fees into advertised fares
