-- i 'm in a room built for laughter and i 'm fighting the urge to faint			1
or at least dab at the beads of sweat forming on my upper lip			0
if you 're not great with small spaces , then an anechoic chamber probably is n't an ideal place to conduct an interview			0
barely large enough to fit two chairs , with every surface covered in foam wedges and a tv bolted to the wall , the sound - proof bunker has the unnerving appearance of an apocalyptic big brother @entity20			0
it 's the type of place where nobody could hear you scream -- and that 's exactly the point			1
this echo - free room is where @entity30 scientist @entity29 has been recording laughter , in an effort to find out what makes us giggle and why			1
" i do n't like coming in here , it makes my head feel thick , like i 've got a load of blankets dropped on me , " said the 46 - year - old professor of cognitive neuroscience , as we sit down to talk about her work			2
" this is where we record a lot of our emotional stimuli			0
we try to make people laugh in here , which is something of a challenge			2
we 've also made people cry in here , so that was a day in the park -- crying in an anechoic chamber , the perfect storm , " says @entity53 before adding her own cheerful chuckle , her large cartoon moon earrings jangling in agreement			2
laugh out loud how do you send someone into stitches , in such an uncomfortable environment ? @entity69 clips help -- that 's where the tv comes in			1
but the best trick is being with friends			0
in fact , we 're 30 times more likely to laugh when we 're with other people , according to @entity53			2
as part of their experiments , @entity53 and her team recorded two types of laughter in the anechoic chamber -- real , uncontrollable whooping , and posed , deliberate , chuckling			1
they then played the recordings to over 1,000 people while scanning their brains with @entity91			0
" when people heard the posed laughter , there was more activation in brain areas associated with ' mentalizing ' tasks -- ie. trying to work out what someone else is thinking , " said @entity53			1
" real laughter was much less ambiguous than posed laughter -- if someone is really laughing hard , it 's easy to understand what they are doing			1
" they also found men and women processed laughter in much the same way			2
" we have a myth that women and men use communication very differently -- that men are n't emotional and women are somewhat too emotional , " said @entity53			1
" it 's not the case			0
" standup scientist @entity53 is a woman of infectious merriment			1
her conversation is sprinkled with warm chortles , and even the message alert on her phone is a cackle			0
as a child growing up in @entity127 in the north west of @entity129 , she was surrounded by parents who were " big laughers , " and recalls them singing silly songs to the point of hysterics			0
unsurprising then , that the mother - of - one calls herself a " standup scientist , " performing with the university 's @entity137 -- a group of researchers using comedy to deliver their message on stage " it was one of the most terrifying things i 've ever done , but i 've completely got the bug for it now , because it 's such an interesting way to approach your work , " said @entity53			1
@entity150 this week @entity53 will again be taking to the stage to help mark @entity152 , in honor of the 19th century female mathematician , often credited as the world 's first computer programmer			1
@entity53 will be one of many prominent female scientists , engineers , and technologists talking about their work at @entity162			2
" it 's still a case that on the whole , the stereotype of the scientist is the gray beard , white coat man in a laboratory -- and of course , that 's not true , " said @entity53			1
" one of the important things to remember about women in science is actually , there 's loads of them			0
it 's just that we lose them , we do n't value them as much , we do n't think they count in the same way			0
" indeed , @entity185 researchers have found potential employers still view young male scientists more favorably than their female counterparts			2
universal language for @entity53 , laughter is more than displaying amusement -- it 's a primal way of showing people that we like them and want them to like us			1
" @entity196 is the only positive emotion we found to be cross-culturally recognized			0
it does n't matter where you are in the world , it 's a sound that people recognize , " she said			0
" interestingly enough , it 's not constrained to humans			2
chimpanzees laugh , orangutangs laugh , even rats laugh			1
" @entity53 pointed to studies done by @entity212 scientist @entity211 , who found that rats made the same high - pitched " laughing " sound when they were playing , as when they were being tickled			1
such is the bonding power of laughter that it can even help make or break a relationship , as @entity53 explains : " some of the things scientists are finding is couples who manage stressful situations with positive affect -- laughter -- are the people who stay together longer			1
" " comedian @entity223 said ' laughter is the shortest distance between two people			0
' i think what @entity223 was getting at was the intimacy of laughter			0
it 's an expression of closeness			0

meet @entity29 , the " standup scientist " uncovering what makes us laugh
discovered brain reacts differently to real and posed laughter
*speaker* at @entity152 , female scientist believed to be first computer programmer
laughter not *confined* to humans -- chimpanzees , orangutangs , and even rats laugh
