@entity0 , @entity1 -- defense lawyers trying to save their client from the death penalty argued tuesday that former @entity7 soldier @entity6 exhibited clear symptoms of acute stress disorder in @entity10 and that a military psychiatric nurse - practitioner failed to diagnose the troubled infantryman and pull him out of combat			1
former @entity7 soldier @entity6 has been convicted of raping and killing a 14 - year - old @entity10 girl			1
@entity6 was convicted last week in @entity16 in @entity1 of murder , rape , conspiracy and obstruction of justice			1
a jury found @entity6 guilty of a raping a 14 - year - old girl , then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence			2
@entity6 also was found guilty of killing the girl 's parents and 6 - year - old sister			2
@entity6 might become the first former @entity7 soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court , where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light			1
four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover - up that followed			0
his lawyers offered testimony tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review " did not meet acceptable mental health standards			0
" dr. @entity47 testified that a military nurse - practitioner who examined @entity6 some three months before the crimes " had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder			1
" yet rather than pull @entity6 out of combat or follow up with additional care , @entity47 testified , the nurse - practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent @entity6 back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the " @entity61 , " one of the bloodiest areas of the @entity64 - led insurgency			1
earlier , defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as lt. col. @entity66 , and she was called by the defense to testify			1
she described @entity6 's company as having the worst morale she 'd ever seen , and she said the entire battalion was " red , " meaning it was " mission incapable " -- the troops were " hostile , vengeful and needed increased control and command , " without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct			1
the psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty , not only to keep up troop numbers , but also because " soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in			0
" @entity66 said procedures were followed , but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions , in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell			1
she said troops often were counseled that " having sad and angry feelings are common , " and that " you are n't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions			0
" at the time of @entity6 's arrest , he told @entity106 agents , " you probably think i 'm a monster			1
" throughout the testimony tuesday , @entity6 repeatedly glanced at the jury			2
he appeared pale , wearing a light - blue button - down shirt and pressed khakis			0
he smiled at times while talking to his lawyers			0
he seemed moved by the testimony of his uncle , @entity115 , who broke down several times while speaking about his nephew			0
" ( @entity118 ) was one of these kids , everyone knows them , no matter what they do , nothing works out , like he had a black cloud hanging over him , " @entity115 said			0
@entity6 lived with his uncle , an obstetrician , in @entity127 for a few months during his senior year in high school , according to testimony			2
he moved back to @entity131 , @entity132 , where he was originally from , after a school counselor told him he was so far behind that he would have to take sophomore - level courses			0
" i do n't know if any of us realized how far behind he was , " said @entity115 , who went on to describe how proud he was when his nephew finished his military training			0
" to me , that was a huge accomplishment for @entity118 , " @entity115 said before breaking down in tears			0
testimony in the penalty phase of the case began monday .			2
