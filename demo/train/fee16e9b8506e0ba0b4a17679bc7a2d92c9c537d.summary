@entity0 -- @entity2 seem poised to choose their next presidential nominee the way @entity5 often choose theirs : according to the principle of " next in line			1
" @entity9 came second in the nomination fight of 2008			2
if she were a @entity5 , that would make her a near - certainty to be nominated in 2016			2
five of the past six @entity5 nominees had finished second in the previous round of primaries			0
( the sixth was @entity18 , son of the most recent @entity5 president			0
) @entity2 , by contrast , prefer newcomers			2
six of their eight nominees since 1972 had never sought national office before			0
obviously , past performance is no guarantee of future results			0
@entity2 chose the next guy in line in 2000 -- vice president @entity31 -- and they may well do so again			2
but speaking from across the aisle , it 's just this one observer 's opinion that @entity2 would be poorly served by following the @entity5 example when president @entity39 's term ends			2
@entity9 is 14 years older than @entity39			2
a party has never nominated a leader that much older than his immediate predecessor			0
( the previous record - holder was @entity44 , 13 years older than @entity45 when the @entity2 chose him in 1856			1
runner - up : @entity47 , 12 years older than his predecessor , @entity48			2
) parties have good reasons to avoid reaching back to politicians of prior generations			0
when they do , they bring forward not only the ideas of the past , but also the personalities and the quarrels of the past			0
one particular quarrel that a @entity9 nomination would bring forward is the quarrel over the ethical standards of the @entity62 -- and , maybe even more , of the @entity66 ' post-white @entity64 careers			1
relying on @entity9 's annual financial disclosure reports , @entity1 reported last year that former president @entity68 had earned $ 89 million in speaking fees since leaving the @entity64 in 2001			1
many of these earnings came from foreign sources			0
in 2011 alone , the former president earned $ 6.1 million from 16 speeches in 11 foreign countries			0
is it an ethical problem for the husband of the person charged with the foreign affairs of the @entity80 to earn so much foreign - sourced income ? let 's rephrase that question : how much time do @entity2 wish to spend arguing the ethics of @entity68 's foreign earnings over the 2016 political cycle ? yet the biggest risk to @entity2 from a @entity9 nomination is not that it would be generationally backward - looking -- or that it would reopen embarrassing ethical disputes -- but that it would short - circuit the necessary work of party renewal			1
after eight years in the @entity64 , a party requires a self - appraisal and a debate over its way forward			1
@entity68 offered @entity2 just such a debate in 1992 with his " @entity100 " ideas			1
@entity39 offered another in 2008 with his careful but unmistakable criticism of @entity68 - era domestic policies and @entity9 's @entity105 vote			1
but if @entity9 glides into the nomination in 2016 on the strength of money , name recognition , and a generalized feeling of " it 's her turn , " then @entity2 will forgo this necessary renewal			1
here 's what could happen instead in 2016 : one candidate could seek the @entity2 nomination on a platform of keeping faith with the ideals of the pre-presidential @entity39 : closing @entity121 , ending targeted killings , and so on			1
another @entity123 could run to represent those @entity2 who supported @entity68 back in the 1990s , and who worry that the @entity39 administration has drifted too far to the left : spending too much , ignoring budget deficits , getting into too many fights with business			1
yet another could run as a full - throated defender of the @entity39 legacy , updating the 1988 @entity134 " stay the course " message			0
this would be a real debate that would summon forth hard thinking about how @entity2 might govern their country if returned for a third presidential term ( as could very well happen , given the continuing political weakness of the @entity5 )			0
a @entity9 campaign would want to shut down any such debate before it starts			0
it would want to inherit the @entity2 nomination and then the presidency as an estate in reversion : a debt long owed , now collected			1
if successful , it would arrive in office without a platform and without much of a mandate			1
that 's not a formula for an effective presidency -- or a healthy democracy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity2 seem poised to let @entity9 inherit nomination in 2016 , writes @entity160
he says after eight years in the @entity64 , @entity2 should *reassess* their future
*picking* @entity9 would be a backward - looking move , he says
@entity169 : @entity68 would arrive in office without a platform or much of a mandate
