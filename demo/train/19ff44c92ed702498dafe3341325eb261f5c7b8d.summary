@entity0 , @entity1 -- it broadcasts only three hours a day			1
its on - air reporters use fake names			0
and its operators do n't know for sure whether their target audience is listening			0
@entity9 , the founder of @entity10 , broadcasting from @entity0			2
@entity11 , based in @entity0 , @entity1 , broadcasts news of the outside world across the border			1
it 's illegal for @entity16 to listen to anything other than state - run radio , and all legal radios are fixed so they can play only channels approved by the government			1
but the founder of @entity10 , @entity9 , believes that more and more @entity16 are secretly tuning in			1
@entity9 is also a defector			0
a former propagandist for the @entity16 army , @entity9 says he collected an illegal radio on one of his patrols			1
he was curious , so he tuned in to a @entity1 broadcast			1
the program centered on the leader of @entity16 , @entity30			1
he says it was meant to dispel the myths surrounding the leader , including the story of @entity30 's birth			0
@entity16 were taught to believe that @entity30 was born on @entity36 , considered sacred in @entity16 history			1
but the radio program @entity9 heard that day said @entity30 was born in the @entity39			0
@entity9 started to doubt everything he was taught to believe , and the more he listened , the more he was convinced that he had to leave the country			0
in 1996 , @entity9 says he made a perilous escape by crossing the @entity16 - @entity44 border , only to be caught by @entity16 soldiers while trying to board a ship to @entity1			1
he was sent back to @entity16 but escaped once again by jumping off a train			1
for days , @entity9 says , he hid in the @entity44 countryside , eating roots and grass to survive before finally settling in a nearby town			0
three years later , he says he made his way to @entity1 , where he started @entity11 in 2004			1
" @entity16 need food , but they also need food for their minds , otherwise they will continue to have deformed children , and they will be people with deformed minds , " @entity9 said			1
the radio program is three hours , but @entity9 hopes to expand to five hours daily , broadcasting during the evenings and late at night , when he believes that most @entity16 are able to tune in			2
but running a radio station is expensive , and @entity61 relies on donations from @entity1 citizens as well as an annual grant indirectly from @entity65 , through the @entity66			1
though funding is sometimes a struggle , they believe that the broadcast is vital to @entity16 because the @entity1 government stopped its own radio broadcasts into the country under the " @entity74 " instituted by former president @entity75 in 1988			1
@entity9 is the only @entity16 on staff at the radio station who uses his real name			2
three of the 15 staffers at @entity61 are @entity1 ; the rest are defectors			2
they use pseudonyms to protect their families who are still living in the @entity16			2
one defector who calls himself @entity87 says he bought a radio on the black market and listened under the covers at night			0
he did n't want to risk being heard by his family or any neighbors , because they would be required by law to report him to the police			0
@entity87 says that although he was nervous about listening to the radio illegally , he also looked forward every night to being able to hear news of the outside world			0
he also says he began to realize that everything he was taught was a lie and decided to escape			0
he believes that the work he does at @entity102 is helping other @entity16 hear the truth about the world			2
" my family is important , but what i 'm doing here at the radio station is even more important , " he said			0
there 's no way to determine how many @entity16 are actually listening to @entity61 , but @entity9 says he receives letters and phone calls almost daily from defectors who say they were able to hear his program through radios bought on the black market			1
" when we started , i thought , if just one person , just one @entity16 was listening , that would be good enough , " @entity9 said			2
" but it 's not just one person			0
" @entity9 believes the @entity16 try to jam their radio signal into @entity16 , and says the @entity16 have called him a traitor			2
if he were ever to go back to his homeland , @entity9 says , he would receive " the highest punishment " for his work			0
but he and the other staffers at @entity61 all believe that it is worth the risk			0
that 's why , when they receive the messages from defectors , @entity9 says , they often grab each other and cry			0
