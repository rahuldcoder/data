-- " @entity0 , a 10 - year - old @entity1 refugee , is scared			1
the lightning and storms outside remind him of the sounds of bombs he heard when he was back in @entity1			2
" -- @entity9 report @entity0 's school was bombed right after he and his friends had left for the day			1
soon his house was also destroyed			0
@entity0 's father , @entity13 , hoped that life in @entity1 would improve , but it did n't			1
he told @entity9 in a recent report , " every minute in @entity1 posed a threat to the lives of my family			1
massacres happened in front of our eyes			0
i had to get them out of there			0
" @entity13 led @entity25 and the rest of his family to @entity28 where they are now refugees			0
as recent reports out of @entity1 confirm , other families have been unable to escape in time			2
according to @entity9 responders in the region and now the @entity37 , armed groups on both sides of the conflict have forced children @entity0 's age and younger to work as combatants , porters , messengers and to perform other support tasks			1
@entity1 is one of many countries where the use of and violations against children in conflict have become chronic			1
this week the @entity49 released its annual @entity50 ( @entity52 ) report			0
this thorough report is a shining example of @entity56 global leadership in the fight against modern day slavery around the world and in the @entity56			1
the report is a critical diplomatic tool to engage countries and enable them to improve their own fight against trafficking			2
it also makes it possible to go beyond words : if a country is in the lowest tiered ranking , sanctions can be applied			0
a lot of ink and bandwidth will focus on the @entity56 @entity52 report this week and what the @entity56 and countries around the world are doing -- or are not doing -- in the fight against modern day slavery			1
yet buried in the @entity82 , there is one page that is often unnoticed			0
it is a list of countries found to be using children in their national armies or in government - supported paramilitary groups			1
the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) of 2008 requires the annual @entity82 to include this list			0
but this year the list is more tragic than in years past , because the number of countries using child soldiers increased from seven in 2012 to 10 in 2013			1
this is the first time since the passage of the @entity89 in 2009 that the number of countries on the list has gone up			0
the 10 countries are @entity99 ( @entity100 ) , @entity101 , @entity102 ( @entity102 ) , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity1 , and @entity108			1
of those ten countries , the @entity56 government gives military aid to seven of them : @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity108 , and now the @entity1 opposition			1
that means @entity56 taxpayer dollars are being spent on armies that use children			2
the @entity89 says that any country receiving @entity56 military aid and found to be using children in its armed forces will lose key forms of that aid , except that which can help countries demobilize and transition children out of their national armies			1
over the past three years , president @entity128 has issued waivers or partial waivers to all countries that receive @entity56 military aid			2
the intent of the law is to use the waiver authority only in extreme circumstances			0
instead , waivers have become the default reaction of this administration and thus our best tool is being kept unused in the toolbox			0
when you keep your best tool in the tool box , it gets rusty and useless			0
these countries need support to help end the widespread use of child soldiers and change takes time			1
nevertheless , they continue to exploit children in their militaries , and the @entity56 refuses to show the will necessary to enforce the law that took effect just three years ago			1
if the @entity56 government is going to put pressure on countries like @entity163 and @entity164 as seen in this year 's @entity82 , why would it not pressure governments using children to fight for them ? the @entity167 has set a deadline of 2016 for all countries to stop recruiting and using children to fight in the military			1
so far the @entity167 has signed action plans to accomplish that goal with each of the violating countries listed in the @entity82			0
however , @entity172 are just words on paper			0
if we are going to realize the goal of stopping the use of children as weapons of war , then the @entity56 needs to actually use its leadership and the tools we have at our disposal			2
they 've already taken a step with @entity102			0
just this week secretary @entity190 appointed former senator @entity191 as the new special envoy to the @entity193			0
senator @entity191 was an original supporter of the @entity89 and his engagement in the region will mean a great deal for the work in @entity104 and @entity102			0
now it 's time for the @entity56 to be just as strategic with the other countries on the list			1
in @entity1 , the @entity82 points out that the @entity1 army and the opposition are using children as fighters , porters , and even executioners			2
what 's more , there are now nearly six million refugee and internally displaced people from @entity1 and many of them are children			1
as a recent report from the @entity216 points out , the likelihood a child will be forcibly recruited to fight in an armed group increases dramatically if that child is a refugee or internally displaced			2
it 's a likelihood that 's all too real for @entity0 and thousands of children just like him			0
the @entity56 continues to show its leadership in fighting human trafficking when it comes to sexual and labor exploitation			2
it 's time for the @entity56 government to do the same thing for children used as weapons of war			1
join us on @entity232 / @entity231			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

armed groups in @entity1 on both sides of conflict are recruiting children
@entity56 government report says it 's one of 10 countries using child soldiers
@entity9 says the @entity56 is supplying arms to countries on that list
@entity251 : " the @entity56 refuses to show the will necessary to enforce the law "
