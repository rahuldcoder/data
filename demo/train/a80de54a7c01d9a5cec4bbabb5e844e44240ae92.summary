-- editor 's note : @entity3 is a comics scholar			1
cofounder of @entity6 , she recently taught a new online course on @entity8			0
gender issues are strewn throughout the comics industry and have been for decades , from the way this particular branch of pop culture portrays traditional male and female roles , to the treatment of costumed attendees ( " cosplayers " ) at @entity19 , to the disproportionately small number of women working in the comic book world			1
the study of gender is as misunderstood as comic books are ; while gender is thought of as a topic for women , comic books are thought of as a boy 's club			1
of course , neither characterization is accurate ; gender is about men and women just as comic books are also for men and women of all ages			1
gender as shown in popular media is not reflective of " real " life			2
think about @entity43 media , and the portrayal of women not just in comics but in magazines , films and other mediums			2
esthetic standards have changed over the decades from the hourglass ideal to size zero models , from looking naturally physically fit to using medical treatments and / or @entity55 to modify bodies			0
these media standards can be attributed to the male gaze			1
the " male gaze , " as students of film know , is a term coined in the mid- 1970s but timeless in meaning ; the tendency of pop art to default to a heterosexual male point of view because , by and large , that 's who makes it			1
this unconscious " entitlement " where men are watchers and women are watched ( and exploited ) creates a sense of entitlement			2
one that is alienating and excludes anyone who is not a straight white male			0
caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes when people think of comic books , they generally think of its predominant genre , superheroes			1
and it should come as no surprise that many of the superhero comic books have major gender issues			1
in superhero comics , both men and women are portrayed with near unattainable bodies ; men are massively muscular while women can make lingerie models look bashful			2
when women comment negatively on how comics females are sexualized , the common reply from men is , " hey , guys are n't realistically portrayed either , so what 's the big deal ? " the difference , of course , is that superhero men in comics look like body builders and athletes while most female superheroes today look more like porn stars			1
the women athletes of today do not look how superheroes portray them			0
why is this ? because the superhero industry caters to an audience of adolescent males			0
or , is the " male gaze " simply the unintentional norm in comic books ? are superheroines victims of the " male gaze " ? are feminine superheroes those who embody the traditional male - defined ideas of femininity or those that espouse the ideal of liberated , empowered women ? or are they simply women who dismiss all tropes of " femininity " and are simply themselves ? think about @entity132 , one of the oldest and best - known female superheroes			1
she is seen as a feminist icon , featured on the cover of the first issue of @entity137			0
yet she runs around in a bathing suit			0
and even though her clothes never change , depending on who draws her , she can look family - friendly on a toy you would n't hesitate to buy your daughter or like a pole dancer on the cover of a graphic novel			0
superman and @entity150 do n't suffer this			0
it 's almost impossible to sexualize @entity149 , who in the current movie ' lost ' his strong man underpants making him less sexualized , and in my opinion completely impossible to sexualize @entity150			2
in fact , @entity150 is often drawn swinging through the air in flexible poses in a skintight costume and i have never once thought of him as sexualized			0
there should be room for all kinds of bodies in comic books , not just the ones that are currently culturally celebrated			1
the problem of the notions of beauty extends far beyond comic books			1
the male gaze , intentional or not , is present in comic books			1
comic books can be powerful , and i argue that the way comics represent women affects the way people view women and how they view themselves			1
the only way to stop this is to talk about the issue , even if it is uncomfortable			0
in order for something to change , it has to be acknowledged			0
my ' @entity8 ' class was one step in that direction			0
as a comic book fan , for every powerful female superhero like @entity192 or @entity193 , there are so many more that are only eye candy for male readers			2
the real power of @entity132 and other female superheroes is that they rise above the pin - up girl quality to be inspirational to young women			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity3			0

gender through @entity206 was a @entity207 ( @entity207 ) taught in spring 2013 . it looked at how to explore gender - *related* *questions* through comic books .
@entity3 says that gender is about men and women just as much as comic books are for both sexes .
she argues the sexualized media standards can be attributed to the ' male gaze ' , which is the tendency of pop art to adapt to the heterosexual man 's point of view .
