@entity1 the straight talking governor is suddenly mealy - mouthed over measles			2
as he toured the @entity5 on monday , @entity4 seemed to leave his tough guy persona back in the @entity7			1
the potential @entity9 2016 presidential contender punted on questions about whether @entity7 should vaccinate their kids amid a 14 - state outbreak of a disease which is staging a comeback after being largely eradicated by science			1
" all i can say is we vaccinated ours , " @entity4 said , while touring a biomedical research facility in @entity19 , @entity20 , which makes vaccines			1
the @entity23 governor added that " parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well , so that 's the balance that the government has to decide			0
" parents : what is your message to parents who do n't vaccinate their kids ? the meandering response trampled his message on a trip apparently meant to polish foreign policy credentials			2
and it was uncharacteristic for @entity4 , a political bruiser who regularly shouts down critics and , just a few months ago , defied the @entity44 by forcibly quarantining a nurse who treated @entity47 patients			1
watch : @entity48 : vaccinate your kids the flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is , @entity4 will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign			1
with @entity63 pouncing on a new chance to brand @entity4 as " anti-science " and reporters jumping on a story that livened up a routine trade mission , the @entity4 camp rushed out an unusual clarification			1
" to be clear : the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated , " said @entity4 spokesman @entity69			1
" at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate			0
" the episode hit the headlines because federal health officials are expressing alarm that a spate of measles cases is being fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules			2
the @entity7 is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world			0
experts note that infants face more than 20 shots before they are 18 months old and some parents question the speed and utility of all the doses			0
claims picked up by the so - called anti-vaxxer movement , now debunked by scientific research , argue that shots can cause childhood autism and other unintended side effects			2
so it 's not surprising that politicians should face questions about the issue -- especially if they are a governor who is thinking of running for president			0
@entity4 seems to have been tripped up more by policy than substance			1
when he spoke with nuance , it came across as a political calculation because his careful remarks contrasted with his own tendency to talk most of the time in an unmistakeably blunt way			0
" get the hell off the beach ... and get out , you 're done , " @entity4 , for instance , once told people he saw on news footage who had yet to take @entity133 's approach seriously in 2011			1
so his equivocation on monday raised questions over his motives			0
was @entity4 for instance fudging on an issue that could play into suspicions of government mandates - in health care , education and other areas -- that could animate the 2016 @entity9 primary race ? there is , after all , precedent for a vaccination flap having political reverberations in a primary race			1
then - @entity152 gov. @entity151 came under fire in 2012 from @entity9 opponents who opposed his executive order requiring girls to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus , which spreads through sexual transmission			1
social conservatives opposed making the shot mandatory for girls as young as 11			0
another candidate , @entity162 , helped torpedo her own campaign by suggesting the drug could cause " mental retardation			0
" @entity4 is not the only candidate being forced to weigh in on the vaccinations debate which looks set to rumble through the 2016 campaign			1
@entity9 sen. @entity9 , a physician , said he thought vaccinations were a good thing but parents should have some input in how they are used			1
he told @entity173 he had staggered a program of doses for his children when they were newborns			0
and he added that he had heard of " many tragic cases of walking , talking , normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines			0
" another potential @entity9 presidential candidate @entity183 was quoted by @entity184 as saying that " vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense			1
" but she added : " i do think parents have to make those choices			0
" @entity4 's struggles in getting his own message across may have several explanations , not all political			1
he could simply have been caught off guard in a place far from the early skirmishes of the @entity9 presidential sweepstakes			1
or perhaps he was off his game , when appearing before a small traveling press pack , after battling a five - hour time difference to stay up late to watch the @entity202			0
but the episode is a reminder of the perils facing a politician who prizes speaking off the cuff			0
" is he going to have to be clarifying his comments all the time ? " said @entity209 , a communications consultant who publishes a daily newsletter on @entity23 politics			2
@entity214 : the measles outbreak " @entity4 is a very casual speaker			1
he talks a lot of the time off the top of his head , " @entity209 said , saying that quality could become a liability when every word is parsed by political journalists or opponents			0
indeed , candidates like @entity4 who build a brand on straight talk , often face extra scrutiny when they appear to hedge on an argument			1
" it depends on what the vaccine is , what the disease type is and all the rest , " @entity4 said , trying to explain his initial quote			1
" i did n't say i 'm leaving people the option			0
what i 'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns			0
" he went on : " not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others			0
so that 's what i mean by that so that i 'm not misunderstood			0
" @entity4 's remarks , for once , were not as direct as those of the more professorial president @entity48 , who touched on the issue in a @entity256 interview with @entity257			1
" there is every reason to get vaccinated but there are n't reasons to not , " said @entity48 , adding " the science is pretty indisputable			0
" taken out of their political context , @entity4 's remarks seem a lot less contentious			1
@entity265 , a @entity266 professor who wrote a book about the vaccination debate in modern @entity7 , said that issues like inoculation schedules tend to be seen as a barometer for candidates on wider issues of scientific and medical issues			2
he says the debate is a rare one which cuts across political divides			2
on the right , objectors tend to sense the overweening hand of big government and infringments on individual liberties			0
on the left , suspicion is driven by skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutrical industry , he said			0
the result is a debate in which legitimate concerns can be drowned out by politics			2
@entity4 " is very moderate in what he is saying , but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine , " @entity265 said			2
@entity4 's comments may also be conditioned by his time in @entity23 where there has been a spirited debate over the issue , with activists complaining about what they say are the nation 's most expansive mandates for child vaccines			1
the @entity306 reported on monday that as far back as his first gubernatorial campaign in 2009 , @entity4 expressed sympathy for parents of autistic children who wanted more input over which vaccines were administered to kids			2
the speed with which @entity4 's camp rushed to put out monday 's storm appeared to signal that the governor was not making some sort of clever play for government - hating activists on the conservative right -- a sector of the @entity9 where he must make inroads			1
but @entity63 would n't give him a break , giving him a dose of his own tough talk			0
" @entity4 is n't a scientist			2
he is n't a doctor			0
and he sure as heck is n't a leader , " said @entity334 spokesman @entity333 .			2
