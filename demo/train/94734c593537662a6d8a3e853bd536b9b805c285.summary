-- there is a growing belief among many in the @entity4 that @entity5 and the @entity6 provoked president @entity7 into annexing @entity8			1
@entity11 's reaction to @entity13 expansion and to the @entity15 's efforts to bring @entity16 into its orbit was , it is said , inevitable			0
in this view , @entity19 leaders backed @entity7 into a corner and , with the situation worsening in eastern @entity16 , it is time we gave him an exit plan			2
interestingly , this is the prevalent view in @entity27 , a region not lacking a large and assertive neighbor of its own			1
in @entity31 last week , several prominent figures told me @entity27 is managing better the challenge of a resurgent @entity34 than @entity5 is a re-assertive @entity35			1
but this is a misleading comparison			0
@entity34 and @entity35 present entirely different propositions to their neighbors			1
president @entity39 recognizes the logic of win - win international politics			1
whilst tightening his political control , he has overseen what is perhaps @entity34 's most ambitious strategy for market - led socio - economic reform since the @entity47 era , and launched an all - out assault on the rampant levels of corruption in the @entity51			1
in focusing on growth and modernization , @entity39 is aware of the importance of a stable and prosperous regional environment , and has sought to manage the growing anxiety and resentment that @entity34 's rise is causing among its @entity27 neighbors			1
relations with @entity61 have deteriorated to a dangerous level , but in @entity34 's southern neighborhood @entity39 has worked hard to improve relations			1
ties with @entity66 and @entity67 have been bolstered , despite competing territorial claims over islands in the @entity70			0
@entity34 is increasingly active in a range of regional multilateral institutions , and has sustained a constructive political and economic relationship with the @entity6 , despite their competing strategic roles in the region			0
most importantly , @entity34 is ever more deeply integrated economically with its neighbors across @entity78 , serving as an essential engine of regional economic growth			0
from a @entity34 perspective , the rising tide lifts all boats			0
neighbors that are economically strong support @entity34 's growth			1
given its relative size , @entity34 's political influence will only grow as a result			1
' law of jungle ' the contrast between this approach and that of president @entity7 could not be starker			2
@entity7 appears to see the world through a unique prism of winner takes all and loser loses everything			1
he represents a 19th century " law of the jungle " mentality , in the words of @entity105			0
this makes @entity35 an altogether more dangerous neighbor			0
as tends to be the case with bad neighbors , @entity35 's belligerence stems from problems at home			2
despite recent high global oil prices , @entity7 presides over an economy in reverse			0
@entity35 's current account surplus was already projected to have disappeared this year , before the crisis over @entity16			2
capital outflows amounted to $ 63 billion last year , a figure at least matched in the first quarter of 2014			0
in the meantime , growth is projected to fall in 2014 to 0.6 % according to @entity35 figures , after achieving only 1.3 % in 2013			0
like @entity39 , @entity7 has tightened his control over the media and political opposition			0
but rather than accompanying political tightening with economic reform , his government has side - stepped market - opening commitments made as part of @entity35 's @entity133 accession			2
and rather than tackling ever - deepening corruption , he has continued to hand his close allies the choicest parts of the @entity35 economy through @entity139 - led corporate mergers and lucrative concessions			2
regionally , @entity7 's notion of national security is to surround @entity35 with what @entity143 , the @entity144 , recently described as a string of economic " black holes " ( such as @entity16 and @entity148 ) and " frozen conflicts " ( including in @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 )			1
these areas remain dependent upon @entity35 for their economic survival and constitute a further hindrance to @entity35 economic growth			0
where @entity34 recognizes the necessity of a stable neighborhood , @entity7 has manufactured a volatile and vulnerable one			1
nor does he show any interest in exiting this spiral			0
having failed with economic coercion , he is now also resorting to political and military coercion to prevent @entity16 from escaping @entity35 's economic stranglehold			2
no return @entity35 will not reform under @entity7 's watch , as some in the @entity4 once hoped			1
he blames the @entity4 for @entity35 's ills and wallows in victimhood			2
but he avoids reforming the economic system he created , and perceives steps towards embedding the rule of law , accountable government and more open markets around @entity35 's neighborhood as threats to his and @entity35 's power			2
if the choice now is between trying to bring president @entity7 gradually in from the cold , or containing his worst instincts towards @entity35 's @entity5 neighbors , the latter is the only rational answer			1
@entity5 and the @entity6 should not accept the way @entity8 was annexed into @entity35 , and should be prepared and willing to apply major economic sanctions should @entity7 raise the stakes again over @entity16 or @entity149			1
over time , @entity16 should be integrated into @entity15 markets through the completion of the @entity190 along with substantial financial support			0
there can be no return for @entity7 to the @entity194 or business - as - usual in @entity13 until @entity35 economic and military threats against its @entity5 neighbors are lifted and a mutually acceptable solution is found to @entity8 's status			1
@entity7 's actions are not a response to @entity5 and @entity6 provocations			1
he has painted himself into a corner with a combination of strategic paranoia , dreams of @entity35 revanche and economic illiteracy			0
as it seeks to present a strong and united response , the @entity4 can ill afford to blame itself			0
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

there is a growing view @entity35 was provoked into annexing @entity8 , @entity213 says
this belief is prevalent in @entity27 , where @entity34 is asserting itself , he says
but @entity213 says @entity34 's president recognizes the logic of win - win *diplomacy*
@entity7 's " winner takes all " approach , however , requires a strong response , he says
