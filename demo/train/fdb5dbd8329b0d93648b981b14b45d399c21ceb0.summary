@entity0 , @entity1 -- incense burns in the corner of the @entity6 living room -- part of an altar to their daughter @entity9 , who committed suicide seven years ago			1
@entity9 was just 12 years old when she took her own life , jumping from a condominium building			0
" we never saw this coming , " says her father , @entity14			0
" she was a daddy 's girl , we went swimming and skiing together and loved to take trips			0
i was convinced there had been a mistake			0
" her mother , @entity24 , lights another candle at her daughter 's altar and says a prayer for her , as she does every day			1
she is convinced bullying at school was one of the main reasons @entity9 killed herself			2
in the months preceding her suicide , @entity9 told her mother she was being taunted by some of her classmates			0
" i called the school and spoke to her teacher , " she says			0
" the teacher said , ' i 'll deal with this problem ' and never got back to me , so we assumed it was solved			0
" @entity9 hinted at bullying in the note she left behind , writing that her decision to take her life " may be because of some of my classmates , studies and exams			0
" but the parents are still fighting a legal battle with the school and the @entity53			1
the family alleges the school was negligent in bully prevention and investigating her suicide			1
@entity57 claims the school only showed him a fraction of the investigation they carried out -- a claim the board of education rejects			0
in a statement to @entity2 , the @entity53 said it was " co-operatively investigating the cause of her suicide , hearing from her parents , collecting as much information as possible including the possibility of bullying			1
" the school also spoke to students , but school officials found no information that connected to her suicide , they said			2
a recent court case ruled in the school 's favor			2
@entity9 's parents filed an appeal to a higher court on monday			2
@entity84 teenagers bullied to death this ongoing legal drama comes as a recent bullying case has horrified @entity1			1
a boy in @entity89 , west of @entity90 , committed suicide last year by jumping off a building after bullies allegedly forced him to practice killing himself			1
@entity1 media and the parents claim the boy had sought help from a teacher , but his pleas were ignored			1
the case has prompted the government to set up a special team to help schools and board of education curb bullying			1
the new anti-bullying task force will be responsible for identifying cases of serious bullying at an early stage and giving advice to education boards and schools , said @entity112 , minister of education , @entity114 , sports , science and technology , at a press conference tuesday			2
the education ministry also announced plans to conduct an emergency survey of all elementary , junior high and high schools in @entity1 next month in an attempt to draw up appropriate prevention measures			1
" people have pointed to how there 's too much academic pressure on adolescents in @entity1 which creates stress and leads to bullying in schools ; other people talk about how @entity1 cases of bullying can be group orientated , " says @entity124 , an anthropologist at @entity90 's @entity125			1
@entity124 , however , believes the problem is far more complex and bullying is certainly not an issue peculiar to @entity1			1
but one issue recurring in @entity1 is " the problem of the school and the @entity53 failing to accept the fact there 's some bullying , " @entity124 says			1
" that can be quite common in many schools , but it 's increasingly become more difficult probably to deny that			2
" @entity9 's parents agree			2
they believe there has been a cover up at her school and no one wants to accept there is a problem			0
" i think the problem is the evaluation - first system in @entity1 education			0
if the school admits a bullying incident , it would affect the teacher 's career , " says her father , @entity14			1
" the members of the board of education and the school are like family members , they tend to protect each other			0
it 's disadvantageous for them to make the investigation open , so the truth is hidden			0
" @entity9 's parents want acknowledgment of their daughter 's bullying to finally feel enough closure to be able to bury her ashes in the graveyard			1
" i just want to know the truth , why did she have to die ? " @entity14 says			0
" unless i know , i just ca n't accept her death			0
" @entity184 @entity183 contributed to this report			0
