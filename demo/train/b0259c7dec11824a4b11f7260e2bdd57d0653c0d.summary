-- according to a new report from the @entity4 , prescription drug overdose deaths in @entity2 are up a staggering 265 % since 2003			1
but it 's not just the deaths that have @entity2 officials worried ; it 's the births			1
" we saw the number of crack babies that died , and this is just another version of that , " @entity10 sheriff @entity9 said			2
" we all need to be concerned			0
" according to state health records , nearly 1,400 @entity2 babies were born suffering from drug withdrawal syndrome in 2010 , a fourfold increase since 2003			1
the state does not track the specific drug the babies are hooked on , but south @entity2 doctors and neonatal nurses believe the increase is due to a sharp increase in pregnant women addicted to prescription drugs			1
" they go through withdrawal symptoms , " said @entity29 , the head nurse at @entity31 's neonatal intensive care unit			1
" they 're crampy , miserable			0
they can have rapid breathing			0
sometimes , they can even have seizures			0
" according to the @entity41 on @entity42 , prescription drug abuse is the nation 's fastest - growing drug problem			1
@entity45 , who runs the @entity46 near @entity47 , says prescription drug addiction overtook crack in 2009 as the main problem afflicting the pregnant women who are treated there			1
" in the very beginning , it was really 100 % crack cocaine , " said @entity45 , who started keeping track of drug trends in 1995			2
" we see a lot more prescription drugs now			2
" @entity45 says new mothers who are hooked on prescription drugs are often reluctant to seek help for fear the authorities will take their babies from them			1
" we wanted to have a place where women did n't have to chose between getting treatment and having their children go into foster care , " she said			0
compounding the problem , women who are addicted to prescription drugs and find themselves pregnant can not safely go off the drugs without medical supervision			1
they need to be weaned off slowly , or the baby will go into withdrawal in the womb			2
at the @entity82 , one mother who became hooked on prescription drugs after her husband died says she felt her baby suffering while she was getting clean			2
" i know that i 'm going through stuff getting off the pills			0
so what 's she going through ? she ca n't talk			2
she 's just a baby , " @entity88 said			0
thanks to the center , @entity88 was weaned off oxycodone before her baby , @entity92 , was born			0
but she fears the long - term effects of her drug abuse on her daughter , who has been suffering from respiratory problems			1
" i want to make sure that she does n't hurt anymore , " @entity88 said			0
" she does n't deserve that , because she 's a princess			0
" @entity88 graduated from the center 's recovery program last week .			0
