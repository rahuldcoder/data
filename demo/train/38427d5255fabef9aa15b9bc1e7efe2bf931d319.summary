in five years on @entity1 , @entity0 says , only one of the nearly 200 videos she 's posted has been explicitly about race			1
yet when the actress , comedian and video blogger hosted a meet - up with fans here at the @entity12 festival , only three out of about 150 of them were white			1
of course that one video , " s * * t @entity14 ... to @entity15 , " has accounted for nearly 10 million of the roughly 18 million views her videos have gotten , combined			1
" it 's a double - edged sword , " said @entity19			2
" it 's opened a lot of doors for me , but i know that because of that video , there are some people who are never going to watch my videos and are never going to give me a chance and see that i 'm so much more than that video			2
" @entity19 spoke sunday on a panel addressing racism and race issues on @entity1 , the @entity34 's no. 1 video site			1
viewing of online video has surged , with @entity1 attracting 800 million unique visitors a year			1
in 2011 , the site saw a mind - boggling 1 trillion - plus views			0
but among the content creators posting to @entity1 who are ethnic minorities , race remains a troubling issue			1
drawing a large fan base is a challenge , and commenters on @entity1 videos can be vicious			1
of the top 100 most popular @entity1 channels that are n't industry - sponsored , there is one black creator , four @entity51 and one of @entity54 descent , according to web researcher @entity55			1
expanding that to the top 200 adds two more african - americans , two @entity51 and one user from @entity60			0
" everyone gets hate comments on @entity1 , " said @entity61 , the creator of the @entity63 channel			1
" you can make the most wonderful video in the world and you will get ' fake ! ' and ' gay ! ' " but for minority creators , " when you get comments , it seems to be targeted toward race almost immediately			1
a lot of people get ' dumb video , stupid video ' -- but with mine it immediately goes to racial slurs			2
" @entity1 has the reputation of hosting some of the nastiest comments on the @entity34			1
@entity1 says it 's mindful of its users ' concerns , and works to help them manage , or remove , hateful comments on videos			1
" @entity1 's guidelines against hate speech and harassment apply to comments as well as videos , " a @entity1 spokesperson told @entity89			1
" we encourage people to flag inappropriate comments using the @entity99 so that we can remove anything that breaks the rules			2
we also give video owners tools for managing comments on their channels -- they can moderate comments , remove individual comments , or disable commenting completely			2
" but @entity107 , a researcher who focuses on cultural issues online , said the site is not unique			2
" @entity1 in and of itself is n't some special device , " she said			1
" it 's actually a reflection of the culture that we 're in right now			0
there 's a reason that folks feel empowered to say things online that they would not say in person			0
in person , you almost want to dare them to say something like that , because they would n't get away with it			0
" @entity19 thinks the nature of @entity1 just makes the hate easier			1
" on @entity130 , you have to like my page , " she said			0
" on @entity132 , i get a lot of negativity , but usually it 's only if i 'm talking about top trending topics and people are just trolling those			0
" ( @entity1 ) is such a visual medium			1
if i have a blog , you do n't need to know what race i am			2
if you watch my videos , you know i 'm a black woman			2
" @entity19 and @entity61 both said their initial reaction was to respond to haters			0
" i have a bad habit that sometimes i do fire back , " @entity61 said			0
" i 'm a jokester			0
someone will misspell something and it 's like i can not not say something			0
" but ultimately , they both said that instead of trying to fight racist comments , they now just ignore them			1
@entity19 says she 's created an e-mail filter that sends any message with racial slurs directly to trash			2
@entity61 called the " block " button " the most amazing button " on @entity1			1
is there a solution other than just hiding from the hate ? both say nurturing your own community of fans helps			0
" if someone comes in with that kind of craziness , my audience will go after them , " @entity172 said			0
" they police my comment section for me			0
" @entity19 has begun posting the nastiest racial comments she gets on her @entity130 page			1
" we laugh at them , " she said			0
" we laugh at the bad spelling			0
we laugh at how stupid it is			0
" along those lines , she 's resolved to ignore the trolls and , instead , respond more to comments from her loyal followers			2
" my new year 's resolution was not to feed the trolls , " she said			0
" for every time you respond , you 're taking time away from the fans who love you			0
how bad does it make my fans feel that i did n't take the time to talk to them , but i took the time to talk to this awful person ? "			0
