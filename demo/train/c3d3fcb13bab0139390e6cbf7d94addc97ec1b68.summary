-- he did n't die with @entity2 on the streets , but @entity5 's career needed some life			1
it was early 1974 , and @entity5 had enjoyed critical acclaim but little commercial success with two albums the previous year , " greetings from @entity11 , @entity12 " and " @entity13			2
" he was n't the rock icon he 'd soon become			0
so the 26 - year - old sat down at his @entity17 , @entity12 , home on @entity18 -- the same house where he would also write " @entity19 " and " backstreets " -- and he began scribbling lyrics on a sheet of ruled paper from a spiral notebook			2
" this town 'll rip the ( out your ) bones from your back / it 's a suicide trap ( rap ) ( it 's a trap to catch the young ) your dead unless / you get out ( we got to ) while your young so ( come on ! / with ) take my hand cause tramps / like us baby we were born to run			0
" on december 5 , almost 40 years later , the handwritten genesis of one of @entity5 ' biggest hits -- and one of rock ' n ' roll 's most well - known songs -- will be auctioned off to the highest bidder			1
@entity44 's @entity43 expects the manuscript , which features 30 lines and marginal notations scrawled in blue ink , to fetch between $ 70,000 and $ 100,000			1
" @entity59 " reached only no. 23 on the @entity49 , but it aged incredibly well , earning the no. 21 spot on @entity54 magazine 's list of all - time greatest songs and being named among the @entity57 's 500 songs that shaped the genre			1
@entity5 explained the song 's birth in a statement from @entity44 's			1
" one day i was playing my guitar on the edge of the bed , working on some song ideas , and the words ' born to run ' came to me			0
at first i thought it was the name of a movie or something i 'd seen on a car spinning around the circuit			0
i liked the phrase because it suggested a cinematic drama that i thought would work with the music that i 'd been hearing in my head			0
" an @entity78 review described the tune as a " celebration of the rock & roll spirit , capturing the music 's youthful abandon , delirious passion and extraordinary promise with cinematic exhilaration			0
" " a blue - collar fairy tale evoking @entity88 in its romanticized grandeur and @entity91 in its street - corner poetic grit , critic @entity86 once described it as ' a ' 57 @entity94 running on melted - down @entity96 records , ' " the review states			0
" ' @entity59 ' is teen melodrama in excelsis , overblown and histrionic in ways @entity88 never imagined ; it smacks of the kind of palpable , life - or - death desperation which threads its way through everything from ' @entity108 ' to ' @entity109 , ' where every action , every thought and every word bears the complete weight of the world			2
" the 1975 track became @entity5 's first worldwide release , and while @entity44 's says many of the original lyrics never made it to the recording booth , the chorus was " nearly perfected " in the handwritten manuscript			1
" ultimately , the song took six months to finalize and clocks in at four and a half minutes long			0
@entity5 aimed for musical perfection and @entity88 - level grandeur which he undoubtedly achieved , " a @entity44 's news release says			1
the manuscript , which was once part of record producer @entity127 's personal collection , will be on public view beginning saturday , according to @entity44 's			1
@entity127 is credited with discovering @entity5 , and he produced @entity5 ' first three albums .			2
