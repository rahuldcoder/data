-- what happened ? @entity2 , a city of more than 200,000 people on the eastern coast of the island of @entity7 , suffered a catastrophic blow from @entity9 , whose force brought a wall of water roaring off the @entity13 of @entity7			1
the storm surge leveled entire neighborhoods of wooden houses and flung ships ashore			1
@entity0 's @entity19 , speaking from @entity2 airport , said terminal buildings had been destroyed not by the typhoon itself but by the storm surge that went on to the city several miles away			1
there were a number of people killed in this area ; locals said that while they were prepared for high winds and heavy rain , they were not expecting this sheer volume of water			1
@entity9 : 30 members of one family missing after storm @entity19 said one man told her : " if we 'd have been warned about a tsunami we 'd have known not to be in the coastal area			2
but the fact they warned of a ' storm surge ' ... we frankly did n't know what that was			1
we did n't know how deadly that was			0
" aid worker @entity45 , from @entity46 , said his charity had a team on the ground before the typhoon hit			2
" what they report back that was around @entity2 was really a kill zone			1
they had a well - prepared emergency response team experienced at handling typhoons -- a harrowing experience -- and only just escaped			2
" they were in a second - story building very solidly built of cement : the windows were blown out and the roof was ripped off			0
all their computers and response equipment was destroyed and they barely survived			2
what they said was it was remarkable that anyone survived , it was so severe			0
" were warnings given and what could have been done ? before the storm hit on friday , president @entity74 warned that the nation faced a calamity			2
however , professional storm chaser @entity78 , founder of @entity79 , who only just escaped from @entity2 before it struck , said it was clear locals had no idea of what was coming			1
" the @entity85 is n't used to getting storm surges -- it 's not usually such of an issue so this would have caught people by surprise			1
they do n't associate typhoons with the rising water levels like that			2
" how to help @entity9 survivors asked whether he thought the message had got out that the storm could be the biggest ever to make landfall , he said , " no , no , it ca n't have done			2
" it 's difficult to know where people could have fled to			1
@entity106 evacuations are a huge logistical headache anyway , but in a country like the @entity85 , comprised of several islands , the relatively poor infrastructure would make it even more difficult			1
elderly people told @entity0 's @entity113 they preferred to stay put and wait it out rather than risk evacuating			2
no one simply anticipated such a massive storm surge			1
@entity118 , @entity120 team leader , reiterated this point			0
he said one of his colleagues in the @entity85 had told him that @entity9 was similar to @entity124 which struck the southern @entity85 last year , killing more than 1,000 people , but 100 times worse			2
" it 's the intensity of @entity128 but spread over a vast area , whereas @entity128 was relatively geographically constrained , " he said			0
" that gives you an idea of what the people of the @entity85 are facing at the moment			2
" is @entity9 being blamed on climate change ? the @entity85 government says it believes the super typhoon is connected to climate change and is urging governments to find a deal at climate talks taking place in @entity144 , @entity145			1
" we can not sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate			0
it is now time to take action			0
we need an emergency climate pathway , " said @entity151 , head of the government 's delegation to the @entity155 climate talks , in @entity156			0
@entity158 , senior fellow at the @entity159 in @entity160 , said it was possible that weather events that once occurred every 20 or even 50 years would now strike every two years			1
" events like @entity164 could be the new norm , " he told @entity0			0
" the challenge for both rich and poor countries is how to adapt to them			1
" all countries will need to adapt to extreme weather conditions			1
even in @entity160 , for instance , a violent storm last month blew a part of my roof			0
the rich may have more to lose , but they may be less well prepared for it			0
" the @entity85 is relatively well prepared for storms -- but there are limits as to what good the precautions will do			0
in this case they were simply overwhelmed , and even the storm shelters collapsed			0
" how do other countries fare in extreme weather events ? in 1999 , 10,000 people were killed when a ferocious cyclone hit eastern @entity189			1
last month , the same region , the state of @entity192 , formerly known as @entity192 , was once again in the crosshairs as the region 's most powerful storm this century struck			1
but there was a much better outcome			0
one million @entity198 were evacuated to shelters ahead of time			0
only 21 people lost their lives			0
thousands of others were saved			0
extreme climate events may be worsening , but technology has helped to save lives			1
we 're now better than ever predicting the scale of storms and cyclones and we 're better than ever at getting the message out			0
@entity212 is another country vulnerable to climate change , but it is one that has done most to adapt to future dangers , according to climate experts			1
@entity158 , senior fellow at the @entity159 in @entity160 , said both countries had learned the lessons from the 2004 @entity222 tsunami that left more than 200,000 people dead , according to the @entity225 @entity224			0
the main lesson learned from 2004 , @entity158 said , is that officials need to be clear with warnings			0
" you ca n't expect complicated warnings to be understood : saying a storm has severity of level 3 or 4 means nothing to most people			1
now it 's much better : you need to say simply when people must evacuate			0

locals prepared for high winds and heavy rain , not expecting sheer volume of water
airport terminal buildings in @entity2 destroyed not by typhoon but by storm surge
hard to know where people could have fled to in region with poor infrastructure
climate change experts say challenge is how to adapt to extreme weather events
