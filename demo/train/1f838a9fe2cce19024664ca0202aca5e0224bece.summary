-- an airplane baggage screener faces dismissal for leaving a note in a passenger 's bag that said " @entity6 " after discovering a vibrator			1
the @entity12 " has initiated action to remove the individual from federal service , " an agency spokesperson said			2
" like all federal employees , this individual is entitled to due process and protected by the @entity15			0
during the removal action process , the employee will not perform any screening duties			1
" the agency randomly selects checked baggage for screening on flights originating in the @entity22			0
lawyer and writer @entity23 tweeted a picture of the note monday and later blogged about it on @entity28			2
" this is what @entity12 will do when they inspect a bag you checked and find a , um , ' personal item , ' " she wrote			2
" total violation of privacy , wildly inappropriate and clearly not ok , but i also just died laughing in my hotel room			0
" the @entity12 identified and removed the employee from screening operations , the @entity12 said wednesday on its blog			2
after completing an investigation , action was initiated to remove the individual from federal service			0
" @entity12 views the handwritten note to be highly inappropriate and unprofessional and apologizes for this unfortunate incident , " the spokesperson said			1
" @entity12 has zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior by our employees as occurred in this instance			1
when this is brought to our attention @entity12 takes swift and appropriate action			0
" an agency official reached out to @entity23 to apologize personally , the agency said			0
at this point , though , she said she wishes the story would go away			0
" it 's easy to scapegoat one individual here , but the problem with the note is that it 's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the @entity22 government , through the @entity12 and other sources , levels every day , " she wrote wednesday after learning of the employee 's suspension			1
" as much as this is a funny and titillating story , when i put the note on @entity73 for what i thought was a relatively limited audience , i was hoping it would open up a bigger conversation about privacy rights ( or lack thereof ) in post- 9/11 @entity22			1
it unfortunately has n't done that , and instead has turned into a media circus , " she said			1
" the note was inappropriate , the agent in question acted unprofessionally when s / he put in my bag , there should be consequences and i 'm glad the @entity12 takes these things seriously			1
but i get no satisfaction in hearing that someone may be in danger of losing their job over this			0
i would much prefer a look at why ' security ' has been used to justify so many intrusions on our civil liberties , rather than fire a person who made a mistake			0
