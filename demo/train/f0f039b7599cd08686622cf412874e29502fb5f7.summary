@entity3 two @entity1 journalists who 'd been imprisoned in @entity2 for more than a year were granted bail thursday , with a court telling them they can await retrial away from jail in a case that has outraged journalists and activists around the globe			1
an @entity2 court thursday ordered journalists @entity14 and @entity16 freed ahead of their retrial on charges that they supported the banned @entity19			1
however , the men were still in custody thursday night , and with government offices closed on fridays for weekly prayers , their release might not come until saturday			0
news of their pending release comes less than two weeks after @entity1 correspondent @entity27 , a colleague who was convicted with them , was released and deported to his native @entity29			1
bail for @entity14 , an @entity2 - @entity31 citizen and former @entity4 producer , was set at 250,000 @entity2 pounds ( $ 32,750 )			1
@entity16 , an @entity2 citizen , is not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country ahead of the retrial			1
@entity14 's family paid the bail thursday			1
the case is scheduled to resume on february 23			0
@entity14 , who says he recently surrendered his @entity2 citizenship under coercion to facilitate his ultimate release , addressed the court thursday , reasserting his innocence and brandishing an @entity2 flag			1
@entity1 applauded the two journalists ' bail but called for their full exoneration			1
" bail is a small step in the right direction , and allows @entity16 and @entity51 to spend time with their families after 411 days apart , " an @entity1 spokesman said			1
" the focus , though , is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally			0
" @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity27 were arrested in @entity2 in december 2013 , accused of supporting the @entity19 and broadcasting footage -- including video of clashes between police and protesters -- that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down			1
the journalists have said they were just doing their jobs , covering all sides of the stories in @entity2			0
all three were convicted last year on charges that included conspiring with the @entity19 , spreading false news and endangering national security , but they have maintained their innocence			1
@entity27 and @entity14 were sentenced to seven years in prison and @entity16 to 10 years			1
the three appealed their convictions , and in january their attorneys announced that @entity2 's highest court had granted them a retrial			0
@entity83 and other observers have long held that @entity85 , @entity14 and @entity16 were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between @entity2 and @entity88 , the small @entity89 country that finances @entity1			1
@entity88 has long been perceived as a supporter of the @entity19			1
at the time of their arrest , @entity2 was mired in political turmoil surrounding the coup of president @entity96 in his @entity19 - backed government			1
after @entity96 's ouster , the military , which had staged the coup , declared the longstanding political party a terrorist organization			0
the deportation of @entity104 and thursday 's bail for @entity14 and @entity16 follow a recent improvement in @entity2 - @entity88 relations			1
in december , @entity2 president @entity108 met with a @entity88 envoy			0
days after that , @entity88 shut down an @entity2 - based @entity1 affiliate , @entity112 , which @entity3 accused of supporting the @entity19			1
@entity27 , @entity14 and @entity16 did n't work for that affiliate , but accusations against the channel were featured in their trial			1
shortly after @entity112 closed , the journalists ' retrial was announced			1
@entity27 was released as part of a new @entity2 law allowing the president to deport defendants			0
defense lawyers also asked @entity2 to deport @entity14			2
in court thursday , @entity14 said that an @entity2 official told him he would have to renounce his @entity2 citizenship first -- something that @entity14 said he had initially rejected			2
" then i got a call from a leading official in the country , and they told me : ' @entity16 , nationality is not a piece of paper , but it is in the heart			2
and you can visit @entity2 as a tourist and apply for the citizenship again			0
' " @entity14 said he surrendered his citizenship reluctantly , adding that it was difficult for him in part because his family has long had proud ties to the military			2
he again denied having any connection with the @entity19			2
" our reports were balanced , and had no fabrication or violation , " he said			0
his brother , @entity149 , said @entity14 was " almost tormented " by having to drop his @entity2 citizenship to be granted a deportation decree from @entity2 's president			2
earlier this month , @entity14 's family appealed for his release in part on grounds of his health , saying in a statement published by an @entity2 news outlet that he was ill with hepatitis c and had an injured shoulder			2
@entity14 injured his shoulder before his arrest and has complained about not getting proper treatment for the injury while in prison			2
@entity27 described in a january 2014 letter how he and his colleagues were detained , saying that @entity170 officials burst into a hotel room that he and producer @entity149 were using			0
officials rushed @entity16 's home , he said			2
@entity2 is the sixth - leading jailer of journalists in the world , according to a tally conducted in december by the nonpartisan @entity177			0
the jailing and sentencing of the @entity1 journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world			1
a campaign led by @entity1 declared that " journalism is not a crime			2
" many tweeted under the hashtag # freeajstaff and journalists , including @entity191 , @entity4 's chief international correspondent , who held up a sign with the campaign on her show			0
on thursday , @entity83 human rights lawyer @entity194 released a statement after @entity2 's @entity196 issued its reasons for overturning the original verdict and sentence in the case of @entity14			2
" i am encouraged by the @entity196 's findings that the trial was unfair , and by today 's ruling granting mr. @entity14 bail			1
at the same time , there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that @entity14 deserves			1
it may also take several months to complete , " @entity194 said			0
on february 2 , @entity194 gave @entity4 a statement regarding @entity14 , who also used to work for @entity4			2
" i have been in touch with the @entity14 family and we are all delighted that @entity27 has been released , " it said			0
" as mr. @entity14 's counsel we are doing all we can to ensure the same outcome for mr. @entity14 , who has suffered the same injustice			0
" @entity194 to push @entity2 to free @entity1 journalist @entity14 's fiancee , @entity221 , told @entity4 in december that she had hoped , before @entity14 's arrest , that they would have a " very simple life			1
" " i was very happy when i first met @entity16 , " she said			0
" i felt that he 's the one			0
and after his arrest , i found myself doing things that i never expected that i 'm able to do			0
" @entity221 said they can now relax after the court has granted @entity14 bail			1
" i am so exhausted and he 's exhausted			0
and now we want to just go out ... enjoy life , " @entity221 said			0
@entity4 's @entity232 and journalist @entity233 reported from @entity3			0
@entity4 's @entity234 reported and wrote in @entity235			0
