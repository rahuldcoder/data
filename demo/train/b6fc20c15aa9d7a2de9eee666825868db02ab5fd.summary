@entity1 sen. @entity0 has galvanized enough rank - and - file @entity3 voters to close the gap with independent challenger @entity6 in one of the nation 's hottest races , a new @entity12 / @entity11 poll has found			1
@entity0 leads @entity6 , 49 % to 48 % , according to the survey of 687 likely voters that was conducted october 2 - 6			1

hoping to hold onto a seat that could be key to determining majority control of the @entity29 , republicans have scrambled to paint @entity6 as a @entity30 in disguise and to criticize the entrepreneur 's business dealings			2
@entity0 hit that point hard during a debate with @entity6 on wednesday , repeatedly slamming @entity6 as a " @entity30 " who would continue the policies of president @entity38 and @entity40 @entity39			1

an @entity51 / @entity50 poll released three days ago showed the challenger with a 10 percentage point advantage over @entity0			0
" @entity55 is likely to be key -- the higher the number of @entity3 who vote , the better for @entity0 , and @entity3 have been at least 43 % of the vote ( and usually higher ) in @entity1 elections since 2000 , " said @entity12 polling director @entity54			1
" @entity0 must convince disaffected @entity3 to like him again			1
an 80 % favorable rating among @entity3 likely voters in the current poll indicates that he may have closed that part of the deal , " he said			2

based on what @entity6 told reporters wednesday after his debate with @entity0 , voters wo n't know until after @entity90 the answer to a critical question : which party he will caucus with if he wins			1
chamber ' all in ' for @entity0 in @entity1 race @entity6 says he would caucus with the majority party			1
but it is possible that the election results could put the @entity29 at 50 - 49			2
in that scenario , there would be no majority party until and unless @entity6 choses sides between @entity19 and @entity3			2
" if i get elected and neither party is in the majority , then what i 'm going to do is i 'm going sit down with both sides , propose a pro-problem solving agenda , and ask both sides whether or not they 're willing to support that agenda			0
and we 're going to be likely to support the agenda and the party that 's most likely to embrace a pro-problem solving agenda , " @entity6 told @entity12			0
sen. @entity0 ' campaign bringing major players to @entity1 translation : @entity6 will be in the cat bird 's seat and plans to use it big time to try to get one of the parties to agree to an agenda he supports			1

the poll also found gov. @entity132 , who 's faced criticism after pushing for steep tax cuts , locked in a dead heat with democrat @entity136 in his bid for a second term			0
each drew 49 % support			0
democrats wo n't be getting any help from @entity38 in the blood - red state			0
just 32 % of likely @entity1 voters said they approve of the job the president is doing			0
@entity1 poll : @entity6 opens up lead on @entity0			1
