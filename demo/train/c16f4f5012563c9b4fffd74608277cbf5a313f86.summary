@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has become an " accidental hero " in @entity1 , spawning a social movement among many @entity1 in support of her battle with the country 's legal system			1
about a year ago , she sent a private email to a list of friends complaining that the @entity13 in @entity0 had misdiagnosed her illness			1
somehow the hospital got hold of the email and reported her to police , pressing charges of defamation			1
that was only the beginning			0
the police promptly arrested the mother of two , throwing her in jail for two weeks before her trial had even begun			1
then , she was tried and convicted in a civil suit -- twice -- before the criminal proceedings had even started			0
on december 4 , a court ruled in the hospital 's favor and ordered @entity3 to pay more than us $ 20,000 in damages -- many times the annual salary of many @entity1			1
" for one year , i 've gone through this legal process , " said @entity3 , who is known by her first name			1
" there 's no certainty in the legal system			1
it 's not clear at all			2
" she smiled softly and said , " i 'm just very , very confused and really very tired			0
" her case has gotten widespread attention -- and public sympathy -- among @entity1 who believe she has been treated unfairly by a legal system that favors the rich at the expense of the poor			0
" when you 've got money you can do anything , " said her lawyer , @entity49			0
" it 's always the small people that are victims of this injustice			2
" the hospital , prosecutors and -- even @entity3 -- did not expect what happened next : a major support movement driven by the power of @entity1 's growing middle class and its mastery of social media			1
it started on sites such as @entity67 and @entity68			0
" @entity70 " became the rallying cry			1
images of the clearly distraught @entity70 , separated from her two young children , generated a wave of sympathy from ordinary @entity1 and quickly made her a cause celebre			1
soon , the country 's leading politicians were flocking to have their photos taken with this soft - spoken woman in a modest , @entity83 headscarf			2
" she 's just like us , " explained one @entity1 housewife			2
" if this could happen to her , it could happen to me , to any one of us			0
" when the courts handed down the fine of $ 20,000 -- a small fortune in @entity1 -- bloggers began " a coin for @entity70 " campaign			1
they encouraged the public to send in 100 rupiah coins -- little more than a cent -- to help pay off @entity3 's fine			1
" when we heard about the fine , we all thought , that 's just not right , " said @entity100 , one of the organizers behind the campaign			1
" we thought the courts have treated this case as worthless as small change			0
and we thought , okay , then let 's collect all the small change to at least pay that fine			1
" the response was overwhelming			0
from street performers to business tycoons , thousands of @entity1 sent in contributions			0
the vast majority were coin collections , but a few wealthy donors chipped in thousands of dollars in cash			2
" it 's a sign of reprimand to all the judges and the police that you ca n't do what you want anymore , " explained @entity3 's lawyer , @entity49			1
" the conscience of the small people , they are crying why is there no justice for them ? " volunteers stayed up until the early morning hours for a week to count the coins that kept coming in			0
schoolchildren were seen counting next to retirees			0
one wealthier woman had enlisted the help of her entire domestic staff to help count			0
" seems to me she 's not at fault , right ? " said one girl still in her school uniform delivering a collection of coins from her class			2
" everyone has the right to criticize others , yet she was sentenced for it			0
" by december 20th , volunteers counted more than $ 60,000 -- far exceeding the amount needed to pay off the fine			1
no one seems quite sure what to do with all this generosity			0
organizers have handed it all over to @entity3 , but she insists the money needs to go to charity			1
" in my heart , my wish is to be acquitted			0
this money from the people should n't be given to people who already have money , " she told @entity2			0
" they probably earn that money in a month			0
but for us , it really means a lot			0
this money has to be used for humanitarian purposes			0
it 's the people 's money , so it has to be for the people to navigate the justice and health system			2
" in the wake of the public outcry , the @entity13 has offered to drop the case and waive the fine that @entity3 owes -- if she submits a written apology			1
the @entity13 maintains that the previous court rulings were fair and just			1
@entity186 's lawyers have an interesting take on the " @entity189 " phenomenon			2
" this coin collection , legally speaking , is effectively an admission of @entity3 's guilt , even though she is still appealing , " @entity190 , @entity186 's lawyer told @entity2			1
" we have won in the state court and the high court			0
@entity3 was proven to be guilty			1
so , of course , we expect the same result in any appeal			2
" but @entity3 is refusing to apologize			1
instead , she is vowing to appeal to the country 's @entity200 while she waits for criminal proceedings to conclude			1
she also plans a countersuit against @entity186 hospital			2
" i think @entity1 are just tired			0
they are fed up with the injustices in this country , " she says			0
" these coins can speak for us			0
after all , anyone can give a coin so anyone can be a part of this			2
