-- in its ruling in @entity3 , the @entity1 paved the way for states and the federal government to legally recognize the marriages of same - sex couples			1
as we near the one - year anniversary of that historic decision , here 's a look back at the history of marriage equality , how we got here , and where the fight for equality still has to go			1
in the beginning , there was @entity22 and @entity23 ... ok , that 's not exactly true			0
i do n't know ; i was n't there personally			0
but we do know that gay coupling has been around for a long time			0
around 350 b.c. , in " @entity30 , " @entity29 said there should be an army composed of same - sex lovers			1
in fact , there was such an army : the @entity36			0
they were renowned for their valor and frequent victories			0
fast forward a bit : in 1972 , just five years after the @entity1 overturned anti-miscegenation laws that barred interracial marriages , the @entity1 dismissed a case brought by two men who were denied a marriage license in @entity47			2
a year later , @entity48 became the first state to pass a law explicitly banning marriage between same - sex couples			1
and so we enter the dark era of explicit attacks and prohibitions on same - sex marriage equality			1
it went downhill for a while			0
in 1996 , president @entity60 signed into law the @entity62 , banning federal recognition of same - sex marriages and authorizing one state to not recognize a same - sex marriage performed in another state , even though the @entity68 requires states to honor each other 's laws			1
anyway , 35 states adopted laws defining marriage as solely between a man and a woman , with 26 of those states putting that discrimination in their constitutions			2
you with me so far ? meanwhile , in the midst of all these anti-gay marriage laws still being adopted , in 2004 a judge in @entity83 ruled that it was unconstitutional under the state constitution to allow only opposite - sex couples to marry			1
four years later , the @entity89 and @entity90 made similar rulings			0
a year later , in 2009 , the @entity92 did the same			0
that same year , @entity93 and @entity94 become the first states to legislatively enact marriage equality			1
voters , legislatures and courts kept wrestling with the issue			0
but in 2012 , a majority of voters in @entity94 , @entity48 and the state of @entity105 passed marriage equality ballot measures , and voters in @entity47 struck down a constitutional amendment that would restrict the state 's definition of marriage			1
it 's as if the new century brought a new day for gay couples			0
and there was no turning back			2
same - sex parent families : share your story today , 19 states and the @entity120 allow same - sex couples the freedom to marry			2
in an additional 11 states , judges have ruled in favor of marriage equality but the cases are tied up in appeals			2
fully 3/5 of our country is now firmly on the side of equality and fairness , as are the @entity135 people			2
in 1996 when @entity60 signed the @entity62 , only 27 % of @entity135 supported same - sex marriage			1
today , 55 % of @entity135 think same - sex marriages should be fully recognized , valid and equal			1
among 18 - to 29 - year - olds , 78 % support marriage equality			1
and those numbers are steadily growing , even among conservatives			0
does marriage equality fix every problem facing the gay community ? @entity147 , no. in 29 states , lesbian , gay and bisexual @entity135 can still be fired from their jobs based solely on their sexual orientation			1
in 33 states , transgender @entity135 can be fired based solely on their gender identity			0
we still do n't even have a federal law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity			0
gay men in @entity135 earn 10 % to 32 % less than similarly qualified straight men working in the same occupations			0
transgender men and women are both more likely to be the victims of violent crime and more likely to be incarcerated			0
in some states , same - sex couples are discriminated against in the ability to adopt children			2
being able to get married and be as happy â € ” or miserable â € ” as married straight couples in @entity135 does n't make other issues of anti-gay discrimination go away			2
but marriage equality is a big and important movement toward fairness and justice for all â € ” a movement that is , at this point , unstoppable .			1

@entity180 : it 's almost a year since the @entity1 struck down @entity62
@entity180 : marriage equality is an important movement toward fairness and justice for all
she says despite *progress* , there is still discrimination against gays and lesbians
@entity180 : there is no turning back , with most @entity135 supporting same - sex marriage
