-- my son has recently been released from active reserve duty in the @entity4 in @entity5 , and the two sides are again talking about a serious ceasefire			0
i am relieved to have my son back and to see that we are talking instead of shooting , and pray that this latest round of negotiations succeeds in bringing us stability and progress towards peace			1
the recent violence has left many dead and wounded , homeless and traumatized on both sides , as well as terrible destruction			0
worst of all , it has overwhelmed many of us with a sense of hopelessness regarding the prospects for peace here			2
both the @entity25 leadership and the @entity27 government have chosen conflict over real peace negotiations again and again in the past			1
they are apparently only able to haggle over ceasefire deals between rounds of fighting			0
the lead - up to the outbreak of hostilities included the wave of mutual hatred and fear that swept the @entity42 and @entity43 populations in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of three young @entity27 teenagers in the @entity48 and the revenge murder of a @entity43 youth in @entity51 , followed by @entity27 mass arrests of @entity25 operatives in the @entity54 , and the arrest of three @entity42 extremists in the @entity58 region			1
@entity27 had also signaled its disapproval of the recently established @entity61 - @entity25 unity government by exacerbating its blockade of @entity5 , punishing 1.8 million @entity63			1
@entity25 responded by unilaterally opening fire and shooting hundreds of missiles at @entity27 population centers			1
the rest is well known -- @entity68 with the destruction and death you have seen on tv screen and other media			0
if not for the @entity78 anti-missile batteries ( an @entity27 invention with @entity81 investment ) protecting those cities , the destruction and deaths on the @entity27 side would have been much greater			1
we @entity27 on the whole supported this action , though there were some protests from the radical left and @entity90 citizens			1
the internal arguments regarding ( frozen ) negotiations with @entity94 president @entity93 and the future of the settlements were set aside as the country was mobilized to support the armed forces in what was seen as an act of defense against the rocket fire			2
a week later , with the onset of the ground offensive , the destruction of the many tunnels dug into our territory for purposes of kidnapping and terrorist killings became the focus of popular support for the @entity4			0
my son , an infantry soldier in reserves , was called up to protect his people , as i have had to do in the past , and as my father did in @entity118 when fighting the @entity119 as a partisan			0
on the other hand , few @entity27 questioned the means by which we deal with these threats or whether the path to this bloodshed was indeed unavoidable			2
fewer @entity27 wanted to hear criticism of the rising numbers of uninvolved @entity43 dead and wounded from the @entity4 's actions			2
those of us in the human rights community who asked questions about this , however carefully and hesitantly , were vilified as unpatriotic or even as traitors , and some activists were physically attacked			0
faced with these reactions , i fear for @entity27 democracy and the moral fiber of the country			2
when faced with a struggle with a hate - fueled terrorist organization like @entity25 , which has no compunction in breaking even humanitarian ceasefire agreements ( they broke five or six ) , and which uses its own civilian population for cover , it is understandable that @entity27 nerves might be frayed			1
the strength of my country and my people through history has always been its ability to debate , be self - critical , and respect differences of opinion			0
there is certainly no prospect for peace here in @entity27 if the extremists within the present government have their way			1
if the @entity43 , on the other hand , are able to change direction and reject the ways of @entity25 as uncompromising haters of @entity27 's very existence , they would strengthen the hand of the many @entity27 who continue to dream and strive for peace			1
some of us see that as a religious commandment -- as @entity175 the elder said ( @entity171 , chapt			0
1 , @entity172 12 , @entity173 ) , one should pursue peace as did @entity177 the high priest : " strive for peace and pursue it "			0
( @entity179 , 34,15 ) after shaky start , cease - fire extension appears to hold is @entity183 peace as far away as ever ?			0

@entity185 is based in @entity58 and works with @entity186
@entity185 says @entity25 , @entity188 have *repeatedly* chosen conflict over real negotiations
there is no prospect for peace if extremists in the government have their way , he says
*palestinians* also need to reject the ways of @entity25 as haters of @entity27 , @entity185 says
