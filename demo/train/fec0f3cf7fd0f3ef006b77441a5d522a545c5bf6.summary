-- suicide bombings , hurricanes , plane crashes , shootings at high schools			0
unfortunately we hear about such events on television or read about them in the newspaper all too often			0
on july 29 , 1999 , i got a real reminder of the difference between news and tragedy			1
what started out as an ordinary day at work turned out to be anything but			0
i had just graduated from college and was seven weeks into my first " real " job when @entity22 came into my office and shot everyone in sight			0
you may have heard about the largest killing spree in @entity29 history , the day - trading shootings in @entity31 ; well i 'm lucky enough to have survived them			1
i was shot in the lower back with a hollow point bullet			0
for those of you who are unfamiliar with hollow point bullets , they are the most destructive			0
they enter your body and expand into a mushroom shape			0
one of my surgeons said the bullet was like a guided missile			0
it destroyed my inferior vena cava , one of the two main veins of the heart			0
it also hit my spine , pancreas and intestines			0
i needed 115 pints of blood during the two emergency surgeries immediately after the shooting			1
to put that into perspective , the human body holds approximately 10 pints			1
the doctors told my family that my chance of survival was one in a thousand			0
that may sound grim , but i would have had no chance if blood was n't available during my emergency surgeries			1
cancer survivor 's challenge : give the gift of life this season i am now missing a disc in my lower back , have scoliosis in my upper back , have extensive scar tissue throughout my abdomen and have nerve damage in my right leg			1
i have progressed from a wheelchair to walking without any assistive devices			0
those injuries seem minimal now , considering my doctors gave me little chance to survive			0
it frightens me to think that there was a severe blood shortage just two days before the shooting			1
there were n't even 115 pints of blood on hand , let alone 115 pints of the type i needed			1
it is not uncommon to experience critical blood shortages in the middle of the summer and during the winter holidays			1
schools are not in session , and people are on vacation			0
if @entity22 had snapped just a couple of days earlier , i would have died			2
it truly is a miracle that i am here today , and i 'm certainly grateful for that			0
it 's hard to believe that i 'm even alive , let alone that i 'm able to walk			2
among the first of many miracle workers who made my recovery a reality was the @entity109			1
as the nation 's largest blood collection organization , the @entity109 made an emergency appeal during that critical shortage in 1999 and made sure that those 115 pints where there when i needed them so desperately			1
as you can imagine , i would do just about anything for the @entity109			1
i will be forever indebted to this organization , even though nothing was ever asked of me in return for those 115 pints of blood			1
i 'm also thankful for the 115 anonymous donors whose blood flowed through my veins			1
without their generous , selfless donations , i would n't be here today			2
i would n't have met my wonderful husband or given birth to our two precious little girls			0
sickle cell patient wo n't let disease define her i have made it my mission to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and increase blood collections			2
i volunteer as the chairman of the @entity109 @entity142 board of directors and am a member of the @entity145 board of directors			1
i serve as @entity147 's corporate champion on the @entity109 life board			1
in these roles , i commit to hosting blood drives throughout the year but most importantly during critical times in late june and december			2
although public speaking is my greatest fear , i also co-founded the @entity109 @entity155 's @entity154 and tell my story to anyone who will listen in hopes that i will encourage those who have never donated to do so and to encourage those who do to do so more frequently			1
most importantly , i practice what i preach by donating blood as often as i can			2
the chances of something catastrophic like being shot happening to you are slim to none			0
while you may not need 115 pints of blood like i did , you will almost certainly need at least a pint at some point during your life and there 's no substitute for it			1
blood can not be manufactured ; it has to be donated			2
a single pint of blood can save the lives of up to three people , and donating generally takes less than an hour and is virtually painless			2
so now is your chance to become a hero			0
all you have to do is roll up your sleeves and give a pint a blood			2
you wo n't meet the recipient , but you 'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you 're saving someone 's life			0
so please schedule an appointment to donate or just stop by the closest blood drive in your area			0
