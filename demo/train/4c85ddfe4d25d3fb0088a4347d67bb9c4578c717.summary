-- @entity1 went after treasure this weekend , and he found a lot of it — just not quite as much as he did last year			2
@entity6 's latest middle - earth adventure @entity7 : the desolation of @entity9 earned $ 73.6 million in its opening weekend , marking a 13 percent drop from @entity7 : an @entity13 's $ 84.6 million bow in december 2012			1
smaug notched the fourth - best december opening weekend ever , after @entity16 , @entity15 ( $ 77.2 million ) , and @entity17 ( $ 77 million ) , and although it undercut its predecessor 's debut , @entity20 , who co-financed the film with @entity23 for about $ 225 million , ca n't be too disappointed with the result			1
the first @entity7 film finished with $ 303 million domestically and over $ 1 billion worldwide			1
even if @entity9 ca n't match those figures ( if it plays like @entity28 , it 's headed for $ 263 million domestically ) , it will be a hugely profitable venture for the studio			1
in order to differentiate it from the first @entity7 , @entity20 marketed the desolation of smaug by focusing heavily on @entity33 's elvish character , @entity34 , who did n't appear in @entity37 's novel , as well as @entity39 's @entity38 , who returned for the prequels , and @entity41 as the voice of @entity9			1
still , audiences , which were 60 percent male and 64 percent above the age of 25 , were n't all convinced to give the series a second try after being turned off by the more juvenile @entity16			2
the film pulled in 49 percent of its weekend gross from @entity51 ticket sales , and @entity53 screens made up $ 9.2 million of its haul			1
crowds issued @entity9 an " a- - " cinemascore grade			0
in second place , @entity58 's animated musical frozen did n't melt despite the heat of dragon 's breath			1
the film fell only 30 percent to $ 22.2 million in its third weekend , giving it a remarkable $ 164.4 million — already more than its $ 150 million budget			1
at the same point in its run , @entity65 had earned $ 115 million en route to a $ 200 million finish — and that film is a perfect comparison since it also opened wide over @entity72 weekend			2
if @entity74 maintains its current pace , it will hit $ 285 million domestically			0
with no new family films on the horizon , it will be the top family choice over the upcoming holiday break			0
@entity80 unwrapped only $ 16.2 million this weekend , marking the lowest - ever start for one of @entity83 's popular madea films — and the second - lowest start ever for @entity83 as a director after 2007 ′ s @entity86 , which opened with $ 11.2 million			1
the last @entity88 entry , 2012 ′ s @entity87 , opened to $ 25.1 million , but @entity80 , which cost @entity89 about $ 25 million to produce , fell far short of that number			1
what makes that performance particularly shocking is that advance ticket sales were booming			0
if there 's a silver lining , it 's that , unlike the rest of the front - loaded madea films , @entity80 has the potential to hold up nicely in the two weeks leading up to the actual holiday			2
audiences gave the picture an " @entity103			0
two blockbuster sequels rounded out the top five			0
@entity106 : catching @entity107 dropped 50 percent in its fourth weekend to $ 13.2 million , giving it a scorching $ 357 million total — and all against a sensible ( for a movie of this scale ) $ 130 million budget			2
it took the first @entity106 five weeks to reach the same total on the way to a $ 408 million domestic finish , so @entity116 still seems poised to break the $ 400 million mark			0
one rung lower , @entity119 : @entity120 grossed $ 2.7 million in its sixth frame and has now amassed $ 198.1 million			0
it will eke past the $ 200 million mark soon , and while that 's no gross to shake a hammer at , it 's slightly disappointing considering the original @entity119 earned $ 181 million and @entity58 was no doubt hoping for more than an 11 percent boost following @entity129 ' run — especially given the fact that @entity131 earned 31 percent more than @entity132 ( $ 409 million vs. $ 312 million ) earlier this year			1
the @entity7 : the @entity133 -- $ 73.6 million 2			1
frozen -- $ 22.2 million 3			2
@entity80 -- $ 16.2 million 4			0
@entity106 : catching fire -- $ 13.2 million 5			0
@entity119 : @entity120 -- $ 2.7 million in limited release , @entity136 proved its mettle with an eye - popping $ 115,000 per theater average — the second best of the year after @entity74 's $ 243,390 premiere weekend in one theater			2
@entity144 , which was directed by @entity145 and stars @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , and @entity150 , grossed $ 690,000 from only six theaters , and now appears ready to thrive when @entity152 pushes it into 2,500 locations next weekend			0
it certainly outshined @entity58 's @entity158 tale @entity156 , which took in $ 421,000 in 15 theaters for a still solid $ 28,067 location average			1
the @entity163 / @entity162 vehicle expands to about 2,200 theaters next week			0
