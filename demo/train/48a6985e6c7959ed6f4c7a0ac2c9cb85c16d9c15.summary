-- @entity2 's exceptional abilities are hard to spot at first			1
she 's an adorably cute 5 - year - old girl from southern @entity3 , small , pretty with big brown eyes			1
to gain her black belt , @entity2 had to learn up to 15 karate moves			1
when we meet for our interview , her hair is tied up in two pigtails , with bright hair clips and a glittering headband			0
she is as shy as most kids her age would be when confronted by a strange man and a television crew			1
some child stars can be precocious but @entity2 does n't act like one			2
in fact , it would have been impossible to imagine her as a karate black belt if it was n't for her white martial arts outfit and her actual black belt			1
like many young girls she would love to be a dancer and she smiles when i tell her that we are doing the interview in a dance studio			0
it 's got varnished wooden floors and ceiling - high mirrors			2
the venue was chosen because it looks a bit like a dojo , or martial arts school			0
i 'm not sure @entity2 understands what a dance studio is and it 's hard to discover her thoughts on many things			1
she only speaks a few words of @entity43 and , even when we use an interpreter , she has to be prompted by her father before whispering short , quiet responses to my questions			0
at first i was concerned her dad was feeding her the answers rather than helping her say what she really thinks			0
however , it soon becomes clear that this is a healthy father - daughter relationship instead of a case of " pushy parents			2
" @entity56 can be stern with his daughter but she clearly worships him , hanging on his every word and happy to follow his instructions			0
when the pair practice karate together their movements are surprisingly well synchronized despite the huge difference in size			0
@entity2 's father is her inspiration			1
he was @entity3 's karate champion for four successive years from 1999 to 2002			1
his daughter started watching him teach the sport and , at the age of 2 , she asked to try			2
@entity56 insists it was @entity2 's idea not his			1
initially , he only gave her some small training and stretching exercises but @entity72 soon realized that his daughter possessed what he describes as a @entity75 - given talent			2
@entity56 says what @entity2 has done in 3Â½ years takes most people eight years to learn			1
to gain her black belt , @entity2 had to learn up to 15 katas			1
a kata is a sequence of complicated karate moves			0
@entity2 can punch , kick and wield different weapons : the @entity85 stick , which is almost as big as she is , and a nunchaku , two short sticks connected by a metal chain			2
there is no doubt that @entity2 's abilities are impressive			1
you only have to enter the phrase " nunchaku accidents " into @entity93 to see how easily things can go wrong			0
however , she is no freak of nature			0
her karate is a feat of memory and technique more than agility and power			0
to be frank , she could n't beat me up -- although i was obviously far too proud to find out by taking her on in a sparring session			0
@entity2 trains for at least two hours every day but says she still has time for other games			1
as well as her dancing , she likes to play football and badminton			0
she tells me that her friends have all started taking up karate after seeing how good she has become			0
unlike her friends , @entity2 's gift has given her the chance to see @entity114			1
she was invited to @entity43 by a @entity116 company to promote a new video game			0
her trip appears to have been handled carefully , with as much time set aside for sightseeing as media work			2
the day after we filmed with @entity2 she was due to go on the @entity123 and was very excited about it			1
@entity2 says she would like to continue her karate in the years ahead			2
she is a black belt first dan , or grade , and there are 10 grades in total			1
she is already a mini master but if she makes it to second dan she can start teaching -- just like her father .			0
