@entity0 , @entity1 -- it seems simple : walk to the refrigerator and grab a drink			1
but @entity6 , 37 , opens the door gingerly -- peeks in -- closes it , opens it , closes it and opens it again			1
this goes on for several minutes			1
when he finally gets out a bottle of soda , he places his thumb and index finger on the cap , just so			1
" just think about any movement that you have during the course of a day -- closing a door or flushing the toilet -- over and over and over , " said @entity22 , @entity6 's mother			1
" i can not tell you the number of things we 've had to replace for being broken because they 've been used so many times			1
" at 12 , @entity6 was diagnosed with obsessive - compulsive disorder , or @entity34			1
it causes anxiety , which grips him so tightly that his only relief is repetition			2
it manifests in the smallest of tasks : taking a shower , putting on his shoes , walking through a doorway			2
there are days when @entity6 can not leave the house			2
" i can only imagine how difficult that is to live with that every single living waking moment of your life , " said dr. @entity48 , @entity6 's psychiatrist			2
in a last - ditch effort to relieve his symptoms , @entity6 decided to undergo deep brain stimulation			1
electrodes were implanted in his brain , nestled near the striatum , an area thought to be responsible for deep , primitive emotions such as anxiety and fear			1
@entity6 's @entity34 trigger @entity6 says his obsessions and compulsions began when he was 10 , after his father died			1
" i started worrying a lot about my family and loved ones dying or something bad happening to them , " he said			2
" i just got the thought in my head that if i switch the light off a certain amount of times , maybe i could control it somehow			2
" then i just kept doing it , and it got worse and worse			2
" " being ocd " has become a cultural catchphrase , but for people with the actual disorder , life can feel like a broken record			2
with @entity34 , the normal impulse to go back and check if you turned off the stove , or whether you left the lights on , becomes part of a crippling ritual			1
the disease hijacked @entity6 's life ( he can not hold down a job and rarely sees friends ) ; his personality ( he can be stone - faced , with only glimpses of a slight smile ) ; and his speech ( a stuttering - like condition causes his speaking to be halting and labored			2
) he spent the past two decades trying everything : multiple medication combinations , cognitive behavioral therapy , cross-country visits to specialists , even hospitalization			2
nothing could quell the anxiety churning inside him			2
" this is not something that you consider first line for patients because this is invasive , " said @entity48 , chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at the @entity110 medical school , and part of the team evaluating whether @entity6 was a good candidate for deep brain stimulation			1
" it 's reserved for those patients when the standard therapies , the talk therapies , the medication therapies have failed			2
" deep brain stimulation is an experimental intervention , most commonly used among patients with nervous system disorders such as essential tremor , dystonia or parkinson 's disease			1
in rare cases , it has been used for patients with intractable depression and @entity34			1
the electrodes alter the electrical field around regions of the brain thought to influence disease -- in some cases amplifying it , in others dampening it -- in hopes of relieving symptoms , said dr. @entity146 , professor and chair of the department of neurosurgery at @entity150			1
@entity146 says stimulating the brain has worked with several @entity34 patients , but that the precise mechanism is not well understood			1
the procedure is not innocuous : it involves a small risk of bleeding in the brain , stroke and infection			1
a battery pack embedded under the skin keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain , but each time the batteries run out , another surgical procedure is required			1
' i feel like laughing ' as doctors navigated @entity6 's brain tissue in the operating room -- stimulating different areas to determine where to focus the electrical current -- @entity6 began to feel his fear fade			1
at one point he began beaming , then giggling			2
it was an uncharacteristic light moment for someone usually gripped by anxiety			0
in response to @entity6 's laughter , a staff member in the operating room asked him what he was feeling			0
@entity6 said , " i do n't know why , but i feel happy			0
" doctors continued probing his brain for hours , figuring out what areas -- and what level of stimulation -- might work weeks later , when @entity6 would have his device turned on for good			1
in the weeks after surgery , the residual swelling in his brain kept those good feelings going			1
for the first time in years , @entity6 and his mother had hope for normalcy			0
" i know that @entity6 has a lot of normal in him , even though this disease eats him up at times , " said @entity22			0
" there are moments when he 's free enough of anxiety that he can express that			0
but it 's only moments			0
" turning it on in january , @entity6 had his device activated			0
almost immediately , he felt a swell of happiness reminiscent of what he had felt in the or weeks earlier			0
but that feeling would be fleeting -- the process for getting him to an optimal level would take months			0
every few weeks doctors increased the electrical current			1
" each time i go back it feels better , " @entity6 said			0
" i 'm more calm every time they turn it up			0
" with time , some of his compulsive behaviors became less pronounced			0
in may , several weeks after his device was activated , he could put on his shoes with ease			0
he no longer spun them around in an incessant circle to allay his anxiety			0
but other behaviors -- such as turning on and shutting off the faucet -- continued			0
today , things are better , but not completely normal			0
normal , by society 's definition , is not the outcome @entity6 should expect , experts say			0
patients with an intractable disease who undergo deep brain stimulation should expect to have manageable ocd			1
lately , @entity6 feels less trapped by his mind			0
he is able to make the once interminable trek outside his home within minutes , not hours			0
he has been to @entity246 with friends twice			0
he takes long rides along the beach to relax			0
in his mind , the future looks bright			0
" i feel like i 'm getting better every day , " said @entity6 , adding that things like going back to school or working now feel within his grasp			0
" i feel like i 'm more able to achieve the things i want to do since i had the surgery			0
" @entity34 in children : ' a darkness has overtaken me '			1

with deep brain stimulation , electrodes are implanted in the brain
the experimental treatment is more commonly used to treat nervous system disorders
doctors are testing it out for depression and @entity34
