jurors hearing the @entity2 wrongful death trial got a stark look at the dead pop icon after a lawyer showed them an autopsy photo			1
@entity2 's unclothed corpse lying on a coroner 's table looked nothing like the world 's most famous entertainer			1
the doctor who conducted @entity2 's autopsy will return to the witness stand wednesday			1
on tuesday , jurors are hearing from another doctor in the trial to decide whether concert promoter @entity20 shares blame in @entity2 's death with dr. @entity22			1
the witness on the stand tuesday is cardiologist dr. @entity25 , who is offering expert analysis of @entity22 's skills and decisions			2
@entity22 was not the " appropriate physician " for @entity20 to hire as @entity2 's tour doctor because he was a cardiologist and not trained to treat the singer 's special needs , @entity25 testified			1
" @entity2 had a history of substance abuse , addiction to medications and sleep disturbance , " he said , not heart or cardiovascular problems			0
@entity22 's agreement to close down his @entity42 clinic to work full time for @entity2 created a conflict , he said			2
the agreement said @entity22 could lose his job if the tour was delayed or canceled			0
" it meant that dr. @entity22 was entirely dependent on the continuation of the tour for his income , " he said			0
much of what jurors heard for the first time from dr. @entity57 monday is a repeat of the scientific evidence presented in the trial of @entity22 , who is now serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter			0
but some of what is in the coroner 's report seems to give more insight into @entity2 's life rather than how he died			1
@entity57 noted in his autopsy report that @entity2 's lips were tattooed pink , while his eyebrows were a dark tattoo			1
the front of his scalp was also tattooed black , apparently to blend his hairline in with the wigs he wore			0
the autopsy confirmed what @entity2 told people who questioned why his skin tone became lighter in the 1980s			2
@entity2 had " vitiligo , a skin pigmentation disease , " @entity57 said			1
" so , some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark			0
" debts , drugs , messy bedroom highlighted in @entity2 trial @entity2 lawyer @entity92 made sure the jury heard that , even though it had nothing to do with how he died			0
@entity2 's mother and three children are suing @entity20 , contending the company that was promoting his " @entity103 " shows was liable for his death because of the negligent hiring , retention and supervision of @entity22			1
@entity20 argues that @entity2 chose @entity22 as his tour doctor and that the company had no way of knowing he was using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put the singer to sleep each night			2
@entity57 concluded that a propofol overdose killed @entity2 , although several sedatives @entity22 gave him that morning contributed to his death			2
@entity113 coroner 's toxicologist @entity111 , who studied the drugs in @entity2 's body , testified monday that the level of propofol found in @entity2 's body was " consistent with major surgery anesthesia			1
" propofol is a dangerous drug when not used properly , he said			0
money woes may have led @entity22 to ' break the rules , ' detective says the @entity113 coroner 's office found 31 deaths in the last 14 years in which propofol was found in a body , including six suicides committed by medical personnel -- doctors , nurses and anesthesiologists -- who chose the drug to end their lives , @entity111 said			1
there have also been several homicides with propofol , including " a mercy killing " in a hospital , he testified			0
if not for his death by propofol , @entity2 's health appeared good enough for him to live a normal lifespan , @entity57 testified			1
" there was no indication from the autopsy that there was anything anatomically wrong with him that would lead to premature death , " @entity57 said			0
he had no signs of being addicted to street drugs , such as needle marks or disease , he said			0
that testimony is important for the @entity2 case , because if the jury decides that @entity20 is liable in his death , his expected lifespan will be key to calculating damages			2
@entity2 lawyers will contend that he would have made billions of dollars in his remaining years through several more world tours , merchandizing , recording and movies .			0

@entity22 was the wrong doctor for @entity2 , expert says
doctor who did autopsy confirms @entity2 had " vitiligo , a skin pigmentation disease "
if not for death by propofol , @entity2 could *'ve* lived a normal lifespan , doctor says
jurors are shown @entity2 's unclothed corpse *spread* out on a coroner 's table
