-- @entity1 is now a big enough concern that the @entity3 people deserve some straight answers			1
and judging from the latest polling , plenty of people will be listening to what they are			0
on wednesday , the @entity9 reported that more than twice as many @entity3 were paying attention to @entity1 as were paying attention to the midterm elections ( 36 % to 15 % )			2
in fact , @entity1 placed higher than @entity14 and the firing of the @entity17 director in terms of public attention			2
this is hardly surprising : the public is bound to want to know more about potentially fatal epidemics that seem to come from nowhere and have a high fatality rate			0
indeed , @entity23 reported tuesday that one - in - five @entity3 worry about becoming infected with @entity1			2
public fear is only likely to increase when the government seems confused and its story keeps changing			0
just look at the early reaction to the spread of the disease			0
as recently as september 16 , president @entity30 said at the @entity31 that : " i want the @entity3 people to know that our experts , here at the @entity31 and across our government , agree that the chances of an @entity1 outbreak here in the @entity3 are extremely low			1
" the president went on to promise : " we 've been taking the necessary precautions , including working with countries in @entity43 to increase screening at airports so that someone with the virus does n't get on a plane for the @entity3			1
" he also characterized the chance of someone with @entity1 reaching the @entity3 as an " unlikely event			2
" fast forward less than a month , and someone infected with @entity1 came from @entity53 , via @entity54 , to the @entity3 ( and has sadly since died )			2
clearly , the system of screening in place failed			0
during his @entity31 visit , the president also announced that some 3,000 @entity3 service men and women would be dispatched to fight @entity1 in @entity43 , a region where epidemiologists have estimated there could be between 550,000 and 1.4 million @entity1 cases in @entity64 and @entity53 alone by the end of january 2015			1
the experience of @entity3 troops in @entity53 a decade ago is a reminder of the additional risks @entity3 troops face when sent to places where dangerous diseases are widespread ; roughly a quarter of @entity3 troops sent to @entity53 in 2003 reportedly contracted malaria			1
yet the administration seems not to have properly thought through how it will treat members of the @entity3 military who might contract @entity1 while deployed fighting the epidemic in @entity43			1
asked tuesday if the military was stockpiling @entity80 , the experimental treatment for @entity1 , gen. @entity82 , head of @entity83 , said the military was not because it had not yet been proven effective			2
but given @entity1 's extremely high fatality rate , it is hard to imagine there would not be plenty of patients who would at least prefer to be given a chance to try it			0
meanwhile , the disease appears to have taken another country by surprise			0
reporting on the case of a @entity96 health worker who contracted the virus in @entity64 , @entity93 noted that : " a few months ago , @entity96 officials were touting the country 's ability to handle @entity1 patients			0
... but last night , the tone abruptly changed			0
" @entity96 officials said they had no idea how the aid worker had been infected since " as far as we know , she was wearing a protective suit the whole time and did n't have any accidental contact " with the patient			0
so we have screening that did n't exist , a military commitment that is clearly inadequate but may put our troops at risk , and reassurances about suits that may not work			0
no wonder some @entity3 senators are refusing to comment on the @entity30 administration efforts			1
as @entity124 reported , " sen. @entity120 , a second - term @entity121 from @entity122 , stumbled badly this week when he admitted he is n't sure whether the @entity30 administration has done enough to protect @entity3 from @entity1 , because he had n't been briefed lately			1
" if a @entity3 senator does n't have a clue , it is little wonder so many @entity3 are suspicious that the @entity30 administration is once again drifting into failure , confusion and misinformation			1
all this leaves the public with many legitimate questions that need answering : what is the risk to the young men and women we are sending into @entity43 ? how many of them will come home infected with @entity1 , malaria and a variety of other tropical diseases ? what has to be changed at the @entity147 to invest in new treatments for @entity1 and a vaccine for prevention ? what has to be changed at the @entity152 to fast - track ebola - related medicines so we can save lives as rapidly as possible ? can the @entity31 develop a genuine operational capability to project effective public health assistance into @entity43 and bring the epidemic under control in countries with governments too weak to be effective ? can we develop a screening process for passengers that is reliable and then insist that every person coming out of @entity1 - infected areas be screened -- and , if necessary , quarantined ? the @entity3 people deserve candid and , most importantly , accurate answers to such questions on what is a potentially deadly and dangerous epidemic			1

polls show @entity1 of significant interest to @entity3 , @entity173 says
@entity3 troops face extra potential dangers in @entity43 , such as malaria , @entity177 notes
@entity30 administration has n't properly thought through its @entity1 strategy , he says
