@entity0 -- international travelers , rejoice ! the world 's busiest airport is debuting a billion - dollar solution to the much - griped - about entry procedure for @entity0 - bound passengers			1
the screening hoops international travelers have long faced to escape the confines of @entity0 have led veteran traveler @entity10 to avoid bringing anything more than a carry - on along on long - haul trips			1
arriving back in @entity0 was just too much trouble			1
" if you 're going to walk the concourse , you have to clear your luggage to walk through			2
typically , what i 'm doing is carry - on , but i still have to go pick my bag up and have my bag re-examined by the @entity20 , " @entity10 said			2
that was one of the annoying quirks of an airport that handled nearly 10 million international passengers last year			1
before may 16 , even international travelers whose final destination was @entity0 had to pass through @entity20 checkpoints and recheck checked bags after clearing @entity29 to leave the airport			1
that 's because there was no way to exit the international security zone to the outside world without crossing through the secure domestic terminal			1
all that duty - free fine wine had to get stuffed back into a traveler 's luggage to avoid violating the @entity20 's 3 - ounce rule			2
then add a trip to the baggage claim to pick up checked bags before exiting			1
with wednesday 's opening of the @entity46 , six years later than planned and at a higher - than - expected cost of $ 1.4 billion , there will be much beyond the new ease of exiting to admire and celebrate : the natural light - filled structure , lovely views of airplanes taking off to foreign lands and taxiing to the new terminal gates , new retail and restaurant choices , art installations , a swanky new @entity57 and technology charging areas that recognize the ubiquitous use of smartphones , laptops and other electronic devices			1
the logistics of getting to and from the terminal might present the biggest challenge			1
the new terminal is accessed via a different highway than the rest of the airport , and the city 's rail service connects to the original terminal but not to the new international gateway			1
shuttle buses will run around the clock to connect the old and new facilities			2
while we wait for international travelers to test @entity0 's newest terminal , we asked noted architects , airport operations executives and other travel industry experts to share what they look for in a world - class airport 's design and features			1
an airport must nail down the basics : security , federal processing , technology , retail and restrooms , said @entity94 , an airport consultant who has worked in positions with the @entity96 and @entity97 , including a role as deputy general manager of @entity100			2
make security obvious and easy whether travelers are taking off from a home airport or landing in a foreign land for the first time without speaking the language , travelers want airports to make the process clear			1
do they have time to get snacks before security , or will the security lines be too long and stressful ? if they 're landing for the first time in a foreign country and do n't speak the language , do they know where to get their bags , clear customs and get to their hotel ? " people want to know where they 're at , every step of the way , " says @entity123 , senior online editor at @entity124			1
after @entity123 flew into the @entity129 last fall , he noticed a big clock above security that showed how many minutes it would take to get people through the process			2
" it said one minute , and i did n't believe them , but i was through security in 52 seconds , " @entity123 said			2
" whatever they said it was going to be , it was good to know			2
" when airport architect @entity143 landed at @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146 , and went through security , he watched a video showing the procedure of showing one 's passport to security , getting a picture taken and other details of the process			2
" you want to make security seem like it 's effective and people understand what they 're doing , not just being treated like rats in rat maze , " said @entity143 , associate director of the architecture firm of @entity157 , who has worked on @entity159 and the current redesign for @entity57 's terminal at @entity100 in @entity162			1
reducing the stress of flying cramped security spaces , lack of light and too much noise can contribute to an already - stressful flying experience , where travelers often have to remove much of their clothing in public before being allowed to head to their respective gates			1
" you 're often in an absolutely lightless space with low ceilings , and usually the occupancy rates are in excess of what the building 's mechanical systems would allow , " said architect @entity180 , who worked on @entity183 's @entity182 project			0
the use of natural light , enormous windows to show people where they 're heading ( to the plane or to customs ) and acoustics to dampen the sound of thousands of travelers and workers can contribute to a nicer flying experience , said @entity180 , project architect on the @entity205 airport and a partner at the architecture firm of @entity208 in @entity209			1
" we designed a nice , generous space with some sort of natural light so people would see how the process is working , " @entity180 said			0
" we also used light to let people inside the building know the time of day outside			0
" that helps fliers landing in a different time zone to reorient their body clocks			0
get me something to eat many travelers heading to foreign ports are too squeezed for time to pack their own snacks , and some want more than the usual fast food options that will just sit in their stomachs on a 10 - hour flight			1
careful placement of restaurants with seating and to - go options along the walk to a traveler 's gate can minimize the stress that hunger will cause			0
some winners : @entity244 applauds the design at the @entity247 terminal at @entity100 , noting that customers can pick from many options and pay at the same registers			1
frequent traveler @entity251 loves the local restaurant options at the @entity255 airport 's international terminal			1
let me use my technology with the proliferation of smartphones , laptops and @entity262 for work and pleasure , customers are using technology to check into their flights , check on gate locations and flight delays , and play or work while waiting for their flights			0
that puts more pressure on airports to supply outlets for people to keep charging their devices			0
" it 's clear that connectivity is just a huge issue , " said @entity276 , @entity277 's vice president of operations			1
" if you have to go plug into an outlet outside the bathroom down the hall , that 's not the level of service you want			0
" some airports have added outlet trees placed in seating areas , while others have added power strips in the seats themselves , he said			0
" it 's absolutely something you have to have			0
" connect to public transportation many frequent international travelers appreciate airports that are easily accessed by public transportation			1
architect @entity303 loves flying out of @entity304			0
@entity303 , a principal at @entity305 and head of its airport practice , simply boards a train in central @entity304 that takes him directly to the airport			0
" the train doors open , and i walk 10 or 15 yards , and i 'm right in the airport terminal			1
" @entity123 has a similar experience landing in @entity315			0
" the train just zips right downtown , " he said			0
" you know you 're being taken care of all the way as opposed to being on the edge of town and taking a taxi and not knowing if you 're being ripped off			0
" a change in attitude @entity251 , who runs an independent car rental company in @entity328 , @entity329 , wants @entity29 to make people coming home or visiting the @entity332 feel welcome			0
he echoed the complaints of many @entity332 travelers : they say they often feel presumed guilty upon arrival back home in the @entity332			2
it 's an attitude they say they do n't get when arriving in other airports around the world			2
" you know you have nothing in your bags , and yet you feel guilty , " said @entity251 , who took part in a recent simulation to test the systems at @entity0 's new terminal			1
" i know they see a million people a day , but i only see one ( of them ) that day			0
it 's fun to come back home			0
if they could just say ' welcome back , ' that would help add a human touch			0
" and it 's not just about manners			0
international tourist arrivals to the @entity332 are projected to grow 36 % between 2010 and 2020 , according to the @entity362 , and those visits contribute to the @entity332 economy			2
the association advocates fully staffing customs desks to match international arrival schedules and expanding the @entity29 's @entity368 to include more trusted international travelers			1
( currently , @entity332 residents and citizens of a few test countries are eligible to apply for membership			0
) " people are coming here and spending thousands of dollars and leaving with a better impression of the @entity332 than when they came in , " said @entity374 , @entity362 spokeswoman			0
" how are they treated when they arrive in the @entity332 ? " she asked			0
" it 's their first impression when they come into the @entity332			0
we can have a standard welcome message and still maintain security			0
" which international airports have you flown through ? what do you like or dislike about them ? tell us in the comments section below .			2
