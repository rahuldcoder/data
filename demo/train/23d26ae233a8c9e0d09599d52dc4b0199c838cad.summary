-- for many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree , obstacles abound			1
issues of finance , time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams			2
@entity13 @entity12 is attending an @entity15 university after years of negotiations and court proceedings			1
for @entity12 , the obstacles also involved politics			1
several years ago , @entity20 , a 31 - year - old @entity13 from the @entity22 village of @entity23 , was granted a scholarship to study at @entity25			1
although her town is only a few miles from the university , access to the school was out of reach because of an @entity15 military ban that limited @entity13 students ' access to @entity15 universities , on security grounds			1
but she was far from giving up on her goal of pursuing her education			0
" when i was in high school , it was a dream that i should finish my ph.d. , " @entity20 said			0
after obtaining a master 's degree at @entity44 , a @entity13 school in the @entity22 , @entity20 was granted full scholarships at several international schools , including @entity25			1
with the military ban in place , @entity20 considered studying at a university abroad			0
" i started to think i should get up and take this offer to leave , but it 's not easy to go abroad , and the only chance is for me to study in @entity15 , because it 's important for me to stay close to my family , " @entity20 said			1
@entity20 sought the support of the @entity15 human rights organization @entity57 , which submitted a petition to @entity15 's @entity59 on her behalf in 2006			0
the @entity59 responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow @entity20 to study at @entity25 , where she is pursuing a ph.d. in pharmacology			0
" we argued @entity12 's case for 2Â½ years , and at the end of the day , the military agreed to let @entity12 study , " said @entity65 , director of @entity57			2
" it was impossible to deny her incredible talents and the example she set for women and girls throughout the @entity22 , " @entity65 says			2
the @entity15 military agreed to review all future requests for @entity13 in the @entity22 wishing to pursue a degree at an @entity15 university on a case - by - case basis , based on specific criteria			1
the criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks , that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence , and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to @entity15 , says maj. @entity94 , spokesman for the @entity95			1
the area of study must be supported by an international organization ( such as the @entity98 or the @entity99 ) and approved by the @entity100 and must also be a degree unique to an @entity15 university ( not offered at a @entity13 university )			1
the request must come with a recommendation from the @entity106 , according to @entity107			0
after @entity20 's victory , @entity57 , with the support of a number of @entity15 academics , further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations			0
the @entity15 military 's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing @entity13 - @entity15 conflict			1
in july 2002 , a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of @entity25 , killing seven people			0
the @entity124 fundamentalist group @entity123 claimed responsibility for the explosion , according to @entity13 sources			0
still , some academics at @entity25 believe qualified students like @entity20 pose no security risk , and their acceptance to @entity15 universities could even foster better relations in the region			2
professor @entity135 , a law professor at @entity25 , pushed for the appeal to lift the military 's criteria on @entity13 students			2
he believes that the admission of @entity13 students from the @entity22 would enrich the academic environment at the university , particularly in the study of law			1
" it 's particularly important for classes to be diverse , for people to have familiarity with @entity150 studies and @entity124 law , " he said			0
other academics agree that qualified students such as @entity20 can only add to the diversity of the campus , where thousands of @entity15 @entity156 students are enrolled			2
" my personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow @entity13 students to study at @entity25 , " said @entity157 , vice rector at @entity25			1
@entity20 is a devout muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood			0
" everyday i have to hear something about [ not being married ] from relatives and aunts , " she says			0
" it 's become [ the ] usual			0
" @entity20 , who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women 's center she opened in her community , says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals			1
" i get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the @entity22 who ask me how to apply to universities in @entity15 , " @entity20 said			1
" maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree , " she said			0
@entity20 says she enjoys the collegial atmosphere at @entity25 , where she studies among @entity15 @entity156 , international and @entity15 students			2
she is considering pursuing another degree after completing her ph.d. in two years			0
" i would like to help other people , and i hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier , " she said .			0

@entity13 @entity12 faced many obstacles before attending @entity15 school
she hopes she can open doors for other students to study where they want
she also has become a role model for girls in the @entity22 to pursue education
