if you 've never been to a @entity3 onsen , there 's one tiny bit of protocol worth knowing before you plunge into those steamy waters			1
nudity is n't just the norm , it 's the rule			1
a testament to the shock some of us @entity3 first timers experience upon learning we have to doff our skivvies to take part in the country 's favorite holiday past time , multilingual signs are frequently posted outside the more popular hot springs to outline onsen etiquette			1
the best ones have hilarious cartoon depictions for added emphasis			0
things are no different at historic @entity23 , a gorgeous hot spring facility right on the coast of @entity26 in @entity3 's @entity28 prefecture			1
one of the three most revered onsens in @entity3 and more than 1,300 years old , it 's mentioned in historic @entity3 texts and was once visited by emperors and noblemen			1
but you still have to get naked			0
nowhere to hide at the entrance of the wooden building , visitors enter through the men ( blue ) or women 's ( red ) doors to reach changing rooms which open up to a series of beautiful stone pools filled with natural mineral waters , edged only by the @entity45			1
a high wooden wall divides ladies and gents			0
the manager of @entity50 says that on the days when the sea is rough , waves are known to crash over the rocks , giving bathers a refreshing cool down			0
" we 've had foreign tourists get too hot and decide they want to take a naked dip in the ocean , only to be pulled away by the current and in need of rescue , " he says with a laugh , adding that this actually is n't allowed			2
a wall of huge rocks keeps the women safe from outsiders ' eyes , but the men are n't so fortunate			0
their pools are easily viewed from several rooms in the nearby @entity72 , as well as a viewing platform , where i find myself barely an hour later			0
did i dare look across the shining waters to " see more " ? of course			0
admittedly , i 'm not much of a voyeur			0
at the first blurry glimpse of naked male flesh i direct my eyes anywhere but that onsen			0
@entity82 sands , chilly waters @entity84 is n't just about historical hot tubs and naked humans			2
it 's beautifully compact , centered around a long , blindingly white beach -- the sand was imported from @entity82 -- book ended by impressive rock formations , fishing piers , free onsen foot baths and a few kitschy attractions			2
dotted with aging hotels , @entity95 has a seaside resort vibe that takes off in the summer , with street vendors and nightly fireworks			0
as i walk across its white sands , i 'm floored by how unexpected it feels to find such a beach outside of semi-tropical @entity104			0
the beach is so pristine i feel i could be in the @entity106			0
that illusion is shattered by dipping my feet in the ocean to be reminded with a jolt that @entity3 's coastal waters are still chilly in may			1
nonetheless , proving yet again my theory that children possess underdeveloped thermoreceptors , many kids splash about happily nearby			0
back up on shore , the open - air @entity117 beachside onsen -- swimsuits permitted -- is a nice way to warm up post swim			0
made for breeding giant pandas @entity84 is a hot spot for @entity3 families , due in part to the presence of @entity127			1
no ordinary theme park , @entity127 also has a zoo that is home to five giant pandas -- the most of any zoo in @entity3 -- including twins born in 2010			1
it 's credited with having one of the the most successful panda - breeding programs outside of @entity137 , and is the @entity3 branch of @entity137 's famed @entity139			1
references to the local celebs can be found all over the town , in the form of kawaii ( cute ) souvenirs and signage			0
pirate hideaways and one giant rock tatami mat another top attraction is @entity84 's @entity152 cliffs and caverns			2
up to two kilometers of steep cliffs , some 50 meters high , make up this stunning site , where @entity156 regularly circle overhead			0
visitors can take an elevator down 35 meters to the underground caves ( open daily , 8 a.m. -5 p.m. ) to see where the ocean rushes in			2
there 's also a small exhibit showing how @entity164 pirates of the heian era ( 794 - 1185 ) used the caves as hiding spots			1
eroded by thousands of years of sea action , the rock 's name loosely translates to " 1,000 tatami mats , " supposedly because it resembles the popular @entity3 flooring material			1
@entity175 @entity84 's rock stars do n't end there			2
@entity175 is a 130 - meter - wide rock formation , famous for the moon - like hole in the middle			0
designated a " place of scenic beauty of @entity3 " , it 's easily viewed from a road on the nearby mainland			1
at sunset , the sun appears right in the center of the hole , making it a favorite with photographers			2
where to eat / shop @entity84 is all about seafood			0
i had a fabulous seafood bbq meal at @entity84 's recently opened pier - side @entity198			2
the venue has an @entity201 restaurant and a @entity3 restaurant , but the real prize is the rooftop club @entity106 joint with its views of the nearby beach			1
here , diners can choose live seafood from the market on the main floor and cook it themselves on a little grill			0
for those who find watching shellfish writhe on hot metal a bit too gruesome , there 's a non-seafood menu of beef and pork			1
just outside of @entity26 lies the massive @entity221			1
visitors can take in a tuna cutting demonstration and shop for seafood , produce , fruit and countless @entity3 souvenirs			1
there are also a few quality dining options , including a food court and a seafood bbq spot where you can cook up the fresh seafood you just bought at the market			0
the local brew @entity236 is @entity84 's drink of choice			2
a few kilometers outside @entity26 on the way to the city of @entity241 sits @entity242 , one of @entity28 's biggest ume ( @entity3 apricot ) fruit processing and brewing factories , which is open for tours			1
" everything is carried out by hand , as the fruit is too delicate to be handled with machines , " explains @entity242 's president , @entity242 , whose great grandfather founded the company			2
where to stay the 109 - room @entity257 ( rates from 23,500 yen / $ 229 ) offers great food , private onsens , comfortable @entity3 and @entity262 rooms with sunset views , plus a few cliffside cottages			1
upon check in , guests leave their shoes at the door and are invited to select from a variety of @entity3 yukata ( robes ) or samue ( shirt / pant combo )			1
it 's rather fun seeing everyone plodding around in their bare feet through the lobby , wearing their robes to dinner			2
the hotel is lacking in @entity283 speakers / materials , but staff are very friendly and make an effort			0
travel / contact info @entity287 is two hours and 30 minutes from @entity289 station on the @entity290			0
the town has a decent bus system that will get you to many of the major stops , including @entity127 , the beach , @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity152			1
