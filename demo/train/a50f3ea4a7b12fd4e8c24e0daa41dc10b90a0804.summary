-- on a small tennis court in the @entity3 , love took center - stage			1
it had all the ingredients of a romantic fairytale -- the nervous suitor down on one knee in front of a crowd of strangers , hoping that months of planning would win the heart of the girl of his dreams			0
" i did n't cry once when i practiced it in front of the mirror , it was the nerves that kicked in when i went on the court , " @entity18 , a doubles specialist seeking to find his life partner , told @entity0 's @entity21			1
" i was very afraid that i would n't find any words			0
" the @entity28 had met his love at the same tournament 12 months earlier -- but apart from that , the venue did n't hold great memories for her			1
" she fainted once on that court , had a knee injury on that court , " @entity18 explains			1
fast forward to june 2014 , and @entity39 had just won her opening match of the @entity41 , which hosts both men 's and women 's competitions , when @entity18 made his big move			1
to her surprise , @entity18 came onto the grass with a microphone in hand			1
" i thought , ' uh-oh it 's going to happen now , i ca n't believe it ! ' " recalls the @entity50 , younger sister of former @entity52 champion @entity51			0
" i was standing there sweaty and wrapped in a tournament towel ... it was really romantic			0
" five months of scheming , having involved the tournament 's director three days beforehand , finally paid off as @entity39 said " yes			1
" " i saw some players with tears in their eyes , " @entity18 says			2
" everybody came up and said i have big balls			0
it 's a big step , and doing it on such a stage ... " a wedding had been on their minds for a long time -- three months into the relationship , they were already talking about taking home the biggest trophy of their lives			0
by january of this year , @entity18 was already planning how he would propose to his partner			2
" i wrote down three papers , corrected them all , practiced 30 - 40 times in the bathroom , " he says			0
in a moment that @entity18 can only describe as " magic , " @entity39 took his hand , hugged him and said yes -- to the cheers of joy ringing down from the stands			1
@entity39 says she had " no idea " how @entity18 and his few accomplices managed to surprise her			1
they are partners both on and off the court , playing in mixed doubles competitions together			1
" i go on court , i still love him obviously , but it 's business for me , " says @entity39			1
for @entity18 , who has won three men 's doubles titles with a highest world ranking of 35th last year , the chance to play with her adds another dimension to touring life			1
" i totally enjoy it			0
i feel i am playing more free and easy than actual doubles , " says the 29 - year - old			0
although their engagement was broadcast the world over , they are in no rush to get married , with their busy tennis schedules taking priority			0
immediately after the tournament in @entity112 they headed to @entity52 , losing in the second round to a pairing that went on to win the title			0
" there 's not too many weeks where we are both actually off , " says @entity39			2
the 25 - year - old , who has won three singles titles on the @entity120 and six in doubles , says she has plenty to achieve on - court before starting to think about having a family			2
a former junior world no. 1 -- she won the @entity128 girls ' title in 2004 -- @entity39 is now ranked outside the top 200 after struggling with health problems in 2012 - 13 , but was as high as 30th at the end of her teenage years			2
she has recently had more success in doubles , reaching three @entity120 finals this year -- including @entity112			0
" for now we just enjoy life and each other , and then everything else comes automatically , " @entity18 says			2
