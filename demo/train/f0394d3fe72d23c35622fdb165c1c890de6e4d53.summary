history does not necessarily repeat itself , but sometimes it makes echoes			2
an echo from 50 years ago reverberates today over the flap regarding the @entity5 nickname and logo			1
disturbed by the @entity5 quarter - century ban against @entity13 players , the @entity8 administration in 1961 , with secretary of the interior @entity9 spearheading the effort , instructed team owner @entity15 to lift the racial ban or face federal sanction			1
@entity15 had signed a 50 - year contract to play home games in the newly constructed @entity20 scheduled to open in 1962			2
the federal government controlled the land on which the stadium sat , and as landlord it would deny use to any employer who practiced racial discrimination			2
he would never yield to the government 's demand			0
the @entity5 had a long history and tradition of " no black players " that resonated with its fervent fan base			1
if he signed black players , white fans might retaliate by not buying tickets and merchandise			2
did n't the @entity8 administration have more important issues to deal with than whether the @entity5 had a black player ? and why blacks in particular ? why not other ethnic groups ? why not a female player ? the move to integrate the @entity5 was liberalism run amok , said traditionalists			1
troublemaking socialists were trying to tell a business owner how to run his business			2
but the federal threat of withholding use of @entity20 and mounting public pressure from sports journalists , opinion shapers , @entity57 commissioner @entity56 and the black community , including @entity59 , eventually caused @entity15 to jettison the team 's sacred lily white tradition and hire black players			1
at the time , few @entity62 , including @entity9 himself , considered the @entity5 nickname racially insensitive			1
in fact , @entity9 played high school football and basketball for the @entity68 , @entity69 -- you guessed it -- @entity5			1
in the 1930s when @entity9 went to high school and in the early 1960s when he headed the interior department , racial stereotypes were commonplace			2
african - americans were referred to as " darkies " and " colored , " and native americans as " redskins			0
" on tv westerns , " @entity82 " were sometimes portrayed as noble characters , but " redskins " almost never were			0
over the decades , most @entity62 have come to learn that names like " darkies , " " colored " and " redskins , " not to mention the n - word , are considered racially offensive and hurtful			2
the @entity5 made a partial concession to racial sensitivity in the early 1960s when they cleaned up the demeaning language in their fight song , which read , in part , " scalp ' um , swamp ' um , we will take ' um big score			1
" unlike @entity15 , @entity95 , the present - day owner of the @entity97 football team , is no racist			1
nor are the vast majority of the team 's fans			2
but he , and perhaps most fans of the team , refuses to acknowledge that the nickname and logo are offensive			1
like @entity15 , he is being pressured by the @entity107 and the commissioner of the @entity57 to consider a name change			0
like @entity15 , he is defiant			0
he will " never " give up the name			0
fans of the team defend the name and logo on the basis of history and tradition			1
but a half century earlier , diehard fans were using history and tradition to defend a system of racial segregation in the @entity122			1
@entity13 @entity123 paraded outside @entity20 carrying signs reading " keep @entity125			0
" just like then , current defenders of tradition blast liberals for interfering in an issue that is none of their business			2
traditionalists claim the nickname honors @entity62			0
but the name is no more ennobling than slurs for @entity135 , @entity137 , @entity138 or other @entity136			0
some fans ask why focus on the @entity5 in particular ? because names like @entity141 , @entity82 ( minus @entity142 ) and @entity143 ( minus the tomahawk chop ) are not demeaning			1
" what about the @entity149 of @entity150 ? " one of my college students asked			0
" that 's not offensive or demeaning , " i replied , " but what if they were named ' the @entity149 ' ? " " that would be even better , " he said			0
that answer got a laugh but no one really took him seriously			0
just as in @entity15 's day , public opinion is mounting for racial sensitivity			1
a president has become involved			0
native americans have filed a lawsuit against the trademark			0
representatives of the @entity166 nation have met with officials of the @entity57 to protest the nickname and logo			0
on wednesday @entity166 thanked president @entity170 for supporting a name change			1
journalists like @entity173 of @entity174 , @entity175 of @entity176 , @entity177 of @entity178 , and @entity179 of the @entity180 and others have advocated for a nickname change			0
the echo is loud and clear			0
eventually the @entity97 team owner will hear it .			1

@entity8 administration in 1961 asked @entity5 team owner to lift its racial ban
@entity191 : 50 years later , president @entity170 said team name should be changed
he says diehard fans use history and tradition to defend offensive name and logo
