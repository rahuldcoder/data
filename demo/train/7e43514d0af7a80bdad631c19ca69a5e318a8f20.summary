the columnist , @entity21 , supported @entity5 ' actions , asking readers , " would you stand for this kind of treatment , in your own home , by a police officer who by now clearly has no right to be there ? " in his e-mail , which was posted on a local @entity3 television station 's web site , @entity11 declared that if he had " been the officer he verbally assaulted like a banana - eating jungle monkey , i would have sprayed him in the face with @entity39 [ oleoresin capsicum , or pepper spray ] deserving of his belligerent noncompliance			1
" @entity11 used the " jungle monkey " phrase four times , three times referring to @entity5 and once referring to @entity48 's writing as " jungle monkey gibberish			1
" he also declared he was " not a racist but i am prejudice [ sic ] towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers			0

@entity11 , who identified himself as a veteran and a former @entity84 teacher , also took issue with @entity48 's journalistic ability , calling her " a hot little bird with minimal experience in a harsh field , " as well as " an infidel			2
" the rambling e-mail also suggested that she " should serve me coffee and donuts on sunday morning , " later returning to that line of thought with , " i like a warm cruller and hot @entity96 , black			0
