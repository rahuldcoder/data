@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has long been silent about the details of an ordeal that began in june 2002 when a stranger crept into her bedroom , held a knife to her throat , marched her up a hillside trail and made her his sex slave			1
she has spoken to local groups about how to move on after a traumatic experience , celebrated the passage of a national @entity17 law for missing and abducted children , and offered advice to another alleged kidnapping victim , @entity21			2
in october 2009 , @entity22 drew a general outline of her experience at a hearing to determine whether her accused captor , @entity26 , 57 , was mentally competent to stand trial			1
much of her testimony focused on @entity26 's ability to manipulate people and talk his way out of a jam			1
at that hearing , @entity22 described being forced to sleep face down in her own vomit after @entity26 gave her too much alcohol , daily rapes and being drugged , shown pornography and threatened with death -- a mere outline of the events that transformed her from a 14 - year - old who prayed with her family and read to her little sister into a submissive captive bent on survival			1
a prosecutor provided a sneak preview of @entity22 's story in his opening statement thursday , saying @entity22 " was threatened , sexually abused , degraded and humiliated			1
" he acknowledged the story he was telling was " disturbing			2
" it is even more troubling to hear , he said , in @entity22 's own words			1
@entity22 had been scheduled to appear as the prosecution 's third witness , following her mother , @entity61 , and sister , @entity62			1
she had returned to @entity1 from @entity64 where she was on a mission , a rite of passage typically undertaken by young men raised in the @entity69 faith , although it is gaining in popularity among young women			2
had things gone as planned , she likely would have been on the witness stand friday			2
but a defense challenge over the location of the trial won the attention of a federal appeals court , which halted the trial on thursday			1
assistant u.s. attorney @entity81 had finished his opening statement thursday , and defense attorney @entity83 was just warming up , when the proceedings were halted -- before @entity83 could complete his 11th sentence , according to the official trial transcript			1
the three - judge panel vacated its temporary stay friday			1
the trial is scheduled to resume monday			1
but @entity81 's preview lent a glimpse of what is to come			2
@entity22 was abducted before dawn on june 5 , 2002 , the prosecutor said , and led to a campsite that " was her prison for the next four months			1
" she was stripped , dressed in a robe and brought into a tent for an impromptu " wedding			0
" and then , the prosecutor said , she was raped			1
@entity22 was in tears when she fell asleep			1
a cable was attached to her ankle , and she was kept tethered to another cable strung between two trees			0
she had a bucket for a toilet , @entity81 told the jury			0
the cable was removed after six weeks , but she certainly was not " free , " the prosecutor added			2
rape was a daily occurrence , and she was forced to walk around the camp naked			2
it went against everything sheÂ¹d been taught by her family , everything she believed , he said			0
during this time , the prosecutor added , @entity22 devised her survival strategy			1
she would not resist @entity26 , and she would not antagonize him			0
she 'd go along with him , vowing to " outlive " him			0
and she 'd wait for her opportunity to escape			0
there was a heartbreaking near - miss at the @entity0 public library			0
a homicide detective asked @entity26 to raise the veil @entity22 wore when they were out in public			1
@entity26 objected on religious grounds , saying showing her face in public would be inappropriate			0
the detective did n't challenge him further			0
still , @entity26 was rattled enough to suggest a move out of state , @entity81 said			0
along with @entity26 's wife , @entity136 , they traveled to @entity137 , winding up at a homeless encampment near @entity139			2
there , the abuse continued , @entity81 said			0
" she was sexually abused , degraded , humiliated , forced to view pornography and subjected to daily harangues , never allowed to speak , never left alone , " @entity81 said			1
he added that @entity26 made other attempts to " strip @entity3 of her identity , " to break down her sense of herself			0
he named her " @entity149 , " then let her choose the name " @entity151 " for herself			0
as they traveled , her name changed again , to " @entity154			0
" finally , as they headed back to @entity1 in march 2003 , @entity22 suggested they hitchhike			1
she also urged that they leave the robes and veils behind because it would be easier to find a ride in " regular clothes			0
" shortly after arriving back in @entity1 , they were spotted walking on the street in @entity165 , a suburb of @entity0			0
@entity81 appeared to anticipate questions from jurors similar to those that have been raised over the past seven years : why did n't she fight ? why did n't she run ? was she a willing captive ? or was it a case of @entity173 , in which kidnapping victims come to identify with their captors ? " nothing she did was voluntary , " the prosecutor told the jury			2
" everything she did was to survive			0

new : the appeals court lifts the stay , *denying* the defense request for a *mistrial*
it 's *unclear* when the trial will resume
@entity22 has not *extensively* *discussed* the details of her captivity
the prosecutor says she was raped daily and degraded
