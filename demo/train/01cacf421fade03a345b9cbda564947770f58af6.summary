a @entity1 family may have won a reprieve in its fight to protect its beloved pit bull from a local " vicious dogs " ordinance			1
the village of @entity8 passed an ordinance in october banning pit bulls and @entity11 as of december 1 , but local officials put enforcement on hold after a national outcry			1
it all started with resident @entity17 , who started an online petition to protect her family 's pit bull , @entity21 , from exile or worse			1
her petition , which asks the village to reverse the ban , has drawn more than 200,000 signatures			1
@entity21 is more than the family dog , @entity27 said			1
he provides love and support for her children , especially daughter @entity33 , who uses a halo brace and a wheelchair because of severe neck problems			1
@entity21 acts as a sort of therapy dog for @entity33 , @entity27 said			2
he sleeps by her side every night			0
if @entity33 wakes up with seizures , he rouses her mother			0
owners of the animals received a letter saying that pets found within the corporate limits of @entity8 after december 1 will be " impounded and transported to a veterinary clinic for further disposition , " according to a letter posted on the family 's facebook page			2
@entity53 told @entity54 affiliate kalb that the ordinance was created to placate residents in the small village			0
" we had several residents that were complaining about not being able to walk along the neighborhoods because these dogs were basically running along town , " @entity53 said , according to @entity59			0
@entity53 told @entity59 that the wording of the letter caused a misunderstanding and that town officials do n't want to kill anyone 's family pet			2
village leaders are working to set up an emergency meeting about the ordinance , according to @entity59			0
@entity8 is not the first town to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls , rottweilers or other " vicious dogs			1
" but the @entity81 recommends breed - neutral laws " that focus , not on breed , but on people 's responsibility for their dogs ' behavior , including measures that hold owners of all breeds accountable for properly housing , supervising and controlling their dogs			1
" the @entity93 also signaled its opposition to breed - specific legislation in 2013 , saying " research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources			0
" several states have passed legislation banning local governments from introducing breed - specific laws or ordinances			0
besides , pit bulls are not a breed of dog			1
several breeds of dogs , mainly the bull terrier , the bulldog and the @entity113 , are commonly referred to as " pit bulls			1
" these dogs descended from an @entity117 bull - baiting dog bred to bite and hold bulls , bears and other large animals around the face and head , according to the @entity81			2
they were later bred with terriers to produce a more agile , athletic dog			0
" it is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding -- two dogs being mated without regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring			2
the result of random breeding is a population of dogs with a wide range of behavioral predispositions			0
for this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog , no matter its breed , as an individual			0
