@entity0 -- @entity5 , in a dark corner of @entity1 's @entity0 headquarters , there was a messy pile of @entity8 tapes covered in remnants of packing tape			1
it was january 2005 , shortly after an earthquake had triggered a massive tsunami in the @entity14			0
@entity1 , along with many news organizations , had put out a call for footage of the event			1
what came back were tapes of all colors and sizes , sent over the course of several weeks , that showed dramatic footage of the event captured by people who had lived through it			0
for the rest of us , seeing those waves push through entire towns helped us understand how truly enormous and ruinous the tsunami had been and how much help would be needed to overcome it			0
that 's the magic of television storytelling			2
images and sound take you right into the heart of events and make it possible to imagine what it must have been like , to sympathize and understand			0
but the professionals and their cameras are not always there when the story breaks			0
hence the box of tsunami tapes in early 2005			0
over the next few months , we 'd see a parade of breakthrough moments in digital citizen journalism , the beginnings of a new , much faster and more efficient model for collecting and sharing the events that shape our world			1
there were the dark , blurry cell phone photos from @entity63 trapped underground after the july 2005 subway bombings			0
and the launch of @entity66 and the explosion of user - created online video			0
then the drama and heartbreak of first - person accounts from many of the people who lived through @entity74			0
tiny , pocket - sized digital cameras and media - capable cell phones meant the people living through a story could easily tell it and have their voices heard			0
it was the start of a new world for newsgathering and journalism			2
@entity86 was born into that world on august 2 , 2006			1
it started as a very simple webpage that invited news of all stripes to be sent to @entity1			1
today it 's a community of nearly 900,000 people worldwide who share stories and images of the things that matter to them			1
very often those stories influence the way @entity1 approaches the news			1
for nearly every major news event of the past five years -- from the 2007 shooting on the campus of @entity104 to today 's uprisings in the @entity106 -- @entity107 have shared first - person views of the stories they lived through and changed the way the rest of us understood what happened and what we should think about it			1
more than that , though , @entity86 has led the way in shaping a model for a news organization to report and tell the story of an event together with its audience			1
this is probably a good place to insert a short history or a bulleted list of things we 've learned along the way			0
but instead , i think i 'll tell a handful of stories , all first - person and unapologetically subjective , just like most of my favorite ireports			2
( if you 're reading this story on @entity1 , flip through the photo gallery on top to see the short history			1
) one : the first day honestly , we were a little bored			0
there were four of us on the @entity86 desk , all borrowed from other parts of @entity1			1
we 'd raced to get everything in order -- a zillion development tests and workflow documents and long meetings in intimidating conference rooms -- but once we flipped the switch , we just had to wait for something to come in			0
our upload form had a headline that read " what 's happening where you are ? " the big idea , of course , being that news is open to interpretation			1
we were hoping our audience would let us know theirs by posting what mattered to them			0
it was a fairly heavy news day for the middle of the summer : @entity169 and @entity170 were fighting a war , and it was deadly hot in much of the @entity172			1
and then came the squirrel			2
@entity174 was sweltering in @entity175 , @entity176 , and spotted what looked like a very hot and exhausted squirrel stretched out on a tree branch			1
he snapped a photo , posted it to @entity86 , we called him up and before we knew it , saw it on tv			1
on @entity1 ! a squirrel ! and would n't you know , moments after it aired , someone else posted another one			1
silly as it was , that photo became one of the first @entity86 " assignments " -- in this case , " show us how hot it is where you are " -- and helped us figure out that there 's a lot more to building a community than turning the lights on			1
like , giving people ideas about how to join in , and paying off participation			0
of course ! it 's so obvious			2
but there we were , at the beginning of a giant experiment , starting to figure out how to listen and adapt and keep going while everyone watched			0
two : indecent exposure every social media platform has its a-ha story , the one image or piece of footage that cements its status as something that matters			0
for @entity86 , it might be @entity220 's shocking cell phone video from the 2007 @entity104 shootings			1
it 's most certainly not a security camera video of a man in a parking lot urinating in a gas tank then walking away			2
but , for better or worse , that 's the one that made us stop and argue and articulate the ethos of this thing we were building			2
it was april 2008 , not long after we 'd launched @entity233 , a full - on website for @entity86 complete with a new suite of community tools and instant publishing for users			1
ireporter @entity240 posted a video that looked like a security camera shot of a parking lot			0
a man walks on screen , unzips his pants , opens the gas tank on a car and , well ...			0
he 's still there when a group of bike cops pedal by , spot him and proceed to chase him down the street			2
the video is hilarious and super-watchable , and was already racking up page views and comments without the usual promotional help from @entity1			1
and it 's real -- we easily checked the facts by making a few phone calls			2
is this what @entity86 was all about ? shining light on stupid tricks caught on video ? the argument came down to whether we should put it on the @entity1 homepage			1
@entity86 had recently scored a sweet deal with homepage editors , who agreed to showcase one excellent @entity233 every day			1
we were building momentum for a new site , so it was on us to pick something great and clickable that would entice the millions of people who visit @entity1 every day to get on the @entity86 train			1
so far we 'd highlighted a video of tornado damage in downtown @entity0 , photos of police pushing back riots in @entity284 and footage of a protester hanging a @entity288 flag outside the @entity290 embassy in @entity291			0
and then there was the urinating in the gas tank			0
would it get people over to @entity86 ? oh yes			1
would they watch and comment and share with their friends ? probably			0
would they remember @entity233 as the place for local news that deserves national attention ? um , yeah , no. after round and round of escalating debate , we put it on the homepage for , like , an hour			2
we collected some cheap pageviews , thought better of it , pulled it down , and ended up with a much clearer sense of who we were and what we stood for			0
at the end the day , it 's on us to make editorial choices that articulate what we 're here for			2
and that 's inviting people in to be part of stories that matter			2
this one just did n't			0
three : give a little bit years later , when a massive earthquake struck @entity327 in january 2010 , @entity86 had well established itself as a powerful center for newsgathering and storytelling at @entity1			1
it had put voters at the front of the story of the 2008 @entity172 presidential election and was at the heart of the network 's coverage of election protests in @entity339 in 2009			2
but when the quake struck @entity327 , we saw something new			0
people who had loved ones in @entity327 and could n't reach them started using @entity233 to post photos of missing people along with pleas for help			0
it was n't long before several thousand had stacked up , each one in a slightly different format			0
a small army of volunteers worked on couches and conference calls for days and nights to organize it all into a cohesive database that we could share with @entity359 and the @entity360 and try to find people relief or at least answers			0
@entity1 started showing the names and images on television and helped create some amazing reunions			2
i could n't be prouder of that work and what it means			0
but what stands out to me most about it today is that what made it possible is that we had in @entity233 -- both at @entity1 and in the community at large -- an extraordinarily caring , dedicated and kind group of people who 'd learned over the years how to work together to make something much bigger than any of them could do on their own			1
and at @entity1 , we 'd learned to invite people into our process in real - time , in a spirit of collaboration and exchange and work that needed doing			1
four : what 's next this is less a story and more a prediction , or maybe a birthday wish			2
if we get this right , the future of @entity86 is in more and deeper collaboration , among one another and also between @entity1 and the people it serves			1
here at @entity86 and @entity1 , it started in the way we approached the @entity327 database , and you can see it in projects like @entity74 : then and now and even our walk around the world video			1
it 's certainly the heart of the @entity404 approach @entity1 has used to bring @entity107 and @entity405 together on stories such as this year 's earthquake in @entity408 and flooding along the @entity410			1
it 's about connecting the many voices and expertise and activity that you need to make a story come to life			0
may we all get there together .			0

@entity1 's citizen journalism initiative , @entity86 , is 5 years old
the first @entity86 on tv was a hot squirrel
since then , @entity86 has been integral to most major news stories of the past 5 years
our prediction for what 's next ? collaboration is the future
