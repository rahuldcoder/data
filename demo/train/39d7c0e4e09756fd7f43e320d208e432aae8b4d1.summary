" we will miss him dearly , but his good works -- and his wit and wisdom -- will forever be a part of the city he loved so much			0
" @entity3 told @entity35 in 1998 : " i think my personality was helpful in this job			1
i always had a great sense of humor , though i am also pretty reserved personally			0
i mean , i do n't go to chichi parties ; never did			0
i do n't like going to dinners other than small dinners at the homes of people			0
but i realized that if i was to harness the energies of the people of the city of @entity4 and give them back their pride , i would have to become bigger than life			1
" tweeters loved @entity3 's ' @entity4 - iness ' after he left office , @entity3 -- whose ebullient personality made him popular nationwide -- practiced law , hosted a radio show , was a newspaper columnist and made countless appearances on tv series as himself			1
his cameos included " @entity59 , " " @entity60 " and " @entity61			0
" for two years starting in 1997 , he was the judge on the syndicated show " @entity63			0
" he also reviewed movies online at the mayor at the @entity66 ( mayorkoch.com )			0
in his later years , @entity3 became politically motivated again			1
in 2011 , he grew upset after president @entity68 called for @entity69 to return to its pre- 1967 borders , with land swaps , as the basis of a @entity75 peace deal			0
in his anger , @entity3 crossed party lines to support @entity79 @entity78 in his bid to represent perhaps the most @entity82 district in the country , which covers parts of @entity85 and @entity86			1
@entity3 's endorsement was widely seen as a turning point in a race that few expected a @entity79 to win			1
on the day of the special election , @entity78 won in an upset with 54 % of the vote , with @entity3 standing next to him while he gave his victory speech			1
" i like president @entity68 ... i helped get him elected , " @entity3 said at @entity78 's election night party			1
" but he threw @entity69 under the bus			0
" but in september 2011 , @entity3 said he was impressed with @entity68 's handling of the @entity101 bid for statehood at the @entity103 , where the president expressed support for @entity69 and called for more negotiations between the @entity69 and @entity101			1
" i congratulated him on his speech to the @entity103 in which he acknowledged @entity69 's presence in a difficult neighborhood , " @entity3 said , referring to a party he attended that was hosted by @entity68 and his wife , @entity109 , in @entity4			1

opinion : @entity3 a friend and force to the end the @entity132 said in a 2011 retrospective that @entity3 seemed an unlikely candidate for mayor in 1977			1
" he was a geeky , relatively obscure congressman , considered too liberal to appeal beyond his @entity125 constituency , " the @entity132 said on its website			0
his campaign manager , @entity138 , came up with a slogan that helped @entity3 beat fellow @entity141 @entity140 , who many commentators viewed as the more dynamic character , and @entity79 @entity144			2
'' after eight years of charisma and four years of the clubhouse , why not try competence ? " was a slogan that spoke to @entity4 who were disappointed by @entity3 's predecessors , @entity151 and @entity152			1
@entity3 was a popular mayor -- winning a second term with 75 % of the vote and a third with 78 % -- but as the @entity132 put it : " with @entity4 wearying of his in - your - face shtick and seeking a balm to racial polarization , mr. @entity3 was defeated for the @entity22 nomination by @entity162 president @entity20			1
" before he was defeated by @entity20 , he criticized the rev. @entity164 , a candidate for president in 1988 , and some felt he angered many black voters			0
race relations in @entity4 were also fractured at the time , especially after a 1986 incident in @entity170 when white teenagers attacked three black men , killing one			2
@entity3 's third term was beset by corruption scandals involving his political allies			2
@entity3 himself was never directly tied to wrongdoing , but the scandals hurt @entity3 's image with voters			2
only three @entity4 mayors were ever re-elected twice -- @entity183 and @entity184 were the others -- and all three left office , as the @entity132 put it in 2008 , " drained , diminished and disdained			2
" some new @entity187 thought @entity3 , who published an autobiography in 1984 , had lost control of his ego			2
@entity3 even said he lost because " voters got tired of me			2
" @entity3 , who never married , was often criticized by playwright , novelist and lgbt rights advocate @entity195 for not doing more to stop the spread of @entity197 in @entity4			1
" he was a closeted gay man , and he did not want in any way to be associated with this , " @entity195 declared to @entity35			0
@entity3 found discussions of his sexuality to be humorous			2
" listen , there 's no question that some @entity4 think i 'm gay , and voted for me nevertheless			2
the vast majority do n't care , and others do n't think i am			0
and i do n't give a ( expletive ) either way ! " he told @entity35			0
