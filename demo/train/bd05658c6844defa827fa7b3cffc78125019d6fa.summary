earlier this year , the journal @entity75 published a study by two psychologists who found that participants who were willing to endure pain -- having to put their hands into a tub of ice for 40 seconds , or being dunked into a tank of water -- were not only judged to be more likable , but also given significantly more money from an $ 1,170 pot that could be divvied up any way the other student volunteers wanted			0
