-- the case of @entity2 , who police say confessed to murdering as many as seven women in northwest @entity6 over the past couple of years , is just the latest example of a kind of crime spree that has become all too familiar			1
at a time when television crime dramas like " csi , " " @entity14 , " and " @entity15 " record high ratings with lurid plot lines about repeat killers , it is easy to come away believing that serial killings are as prevalent as they have ever been			1
actually , quite the opposite is true			2
looking at the actual numbers , it is clear that serial murder peaked during the 1970s and 1980s , and has declined dramatically ever since			1
during the 1980s , for example , there were an estimated 200 serial killers operating in the @entity28 ; in the first decade of this century , by contrast , the count was half that figure			1
why ? the reasons for this precipitous decline are complex			2
in part , the drop parallels the sharp downturn in all forms of homicide beginning during the 1990s , and is , to some extent , a result of some of the same factors			0
the growth in the @entity28 prison population , for example , kept many violent predators -- including many potential serial killers -- safely behind bars			1
in 1980 , for example , the number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal authorities stood at 330,000			0
by 1990 that number had climbed to 773,000 , and by 2009 it had soared to 1.6 million			0
but the decline in serial murder may also reflect improved law enforcement investigative techniques			1
true , things might not always work quite as smoothly as they do on the crime drama " bones , " but advances in dna profiling and databases , as well as enhanced interagency communication , may have helped capture many would - be serial killers before they were able to amass a large victim count			1
in addition , a host of technological innovations -- including @entity69 , sex offender registries , video surveillance systems , gps tracking of mobile phones and vehicles , and monitoring of social media and chat rooms -- have presented law enforcement with additional tools to identify and apprehend sexual predators early in their criminal careers			0
meanwhile , the @entity83 has provided sex offenders with a wide variety of options for satiating their sadistic desires without needing to involve unwilling victims			0
of course , society may frown on the level of violence in widely available pornography			0
but as distasteful as it may sound , this ready accessibility may also serve as a cathartic release valve for certain individuals who might otherwise resort to rape , torture and murder ( although the evidence on whether it is a release valve or sometimes a catalyst is mixed )			2
technology has also provided greater safety for potential victims			0
cell phones and their photographic functions have added some level of protection from strangers			0
at the same time , the greater public awareness of serial offenders has significantly increased the level of caution about accepting rides or gifts from total strangers			2
many parents , for example , have become reluctant to permit their unsupervised children to play in the street or the front yard of their own home			0
decades ago , hitchhiking was a relatively common way of getting around			0
nowadays , most people avoid hitching a ride unless there is absolutely no alternative			0
when was the last time you actually saw someone thumbing on the side of the road ? unfortunately , a reduction in known cases of serial murder is not the end of the story			1
it is possible , for instance , that a number of cases occurring in recent years have not yet been identified and solved , causing them to be absent from the database of known perpetrators			0
even now , as in previous decades , so - called " linkage blindness " continues to prevent or at least delay recognition that a single killer may be responsible for widespread carnage			0
before identifying a serial killer , we must first acknowledge the strong possibility that one is operating in a particular community			2
over the decades , many serial killers have cleverly concealed the extent of their murderous behavior by varying their modus operandi , as well as the types of victim they target			1
forty years ago , when many @entity28 were first apprised of accounts of serial murder , the fascination with the phenomenon -- and with names like @entity163 and @entity164 -- was palpable			1
as a result , enterprising entrepreneurs marketed serial killer " murderabilia , " including calendars , trading cards , t - shirts , action figures , paintings and comic books			2
as the public 's fascination with serial killers has subsided , so has its preoccupation with more typical cases that do not yield double - digit body counts or particularly gruesome tortures			1
to attract extensive publicity , a serial killer almost has to stay on the loose for decades , kill a dozen victims or more , and engage in disturbing rituals or cannibalism			2
fortunately , such characteristics are even rarer than the fans they inspire			0
yet regardless of the decline in numbers , any serial murder remains a difficult and perplexing problem for law enforcement			1
there are still as many as 10 serial killers captured each year by the police , and even a drop in the numbers is unlikely to reduce the level of fear that serial killers still create			1
indeed , the power they have over the public 's psyche remains extraordinary , and criminologists have a responsibility to try to understand how and why these offenders take the lives of innocent victims -- and how they can do so with such chillingly cool deliberation			0
