-- as hosts of the largest carnival in world football , the pressure is on for @entity6 's national football team to ignite the imagination of local fans by performing well at the @entity9			1
if @entity6 is to succeed in their mission , conventional wisdom would be that coach @entity12 will turn to his best players to deliver results			0
however , despite firing in 31 goals in 77 appearances to become @entity6 's all - time record goal scorer , @entity15 has had question marks hanging over his participation for his country come june			1
the prolific striker , who plays for @entity24 side @entity23 , has only recently returned from a period of international exile , just the latest incident in a stormy history with his country 's football team			1
he first angered @entity6 fans by going into international retirement in 2002 aged just 25			0
the reason ? traveling to international games was hampering his ability to play @entity38 football for @entity39 and , later , @entity40			1
" the whole pattern was killing my career , that 's why i quit international football , " he told @entity42 newspaper @entity41 in 2004			0
" @entity48 football needs the same calendar as @entity38 otherwise its best players are going to suffer			0
" he was talked into returning , only to quit again after the @entity51 when the president of the @entity48 fa , @entity54 , made an uncomplimentary comment about his performance			0
that period of self - imposed exile lasted 20 months , until new coach @entity12 flew to @entity60 to talk to @entity15 , who was now at @entity23			1
but after @entity12 quit to care for his sick wife , @entity15 fell out with replacement boss @entity62 after he refused to play in two warm up matches last march			0
despite pleas from @entity48 president @entity65 , @entity62 refused to pick him			0
but a run of eight defeats in nine games , which saw the team slump to 86th on the @entity71 rankings , @entity62 was sacked			0
with goals being @entity6 's biggest problem , it was no surprise that returning coach @entity12 made persuading @entity15 to return , for a second time , his top priority			1
sure enough , @entity15 returned to the fray last month against @entity79			0
the 32 - year - old told local press : " i want to start afresh and help @entity6 do well in the @entity83 finals			1
it is every player 's dream to play for his country ... and i have matured			0
" " in the past i was a loose cannon and i apologize if i was wrong [ but ] i am still the best at what i do - and that is scoring goals , " he added			0
few could argue with @entity15 's record			2
born in @entity94 , an impoverished township in @entity95 known for its high unemployment , poverty and gang - related violence , @entity15 escaped to become one of @entity6 's most successful football exports			1
@entity15 started his career in 1995 aged 18 with @entity102 of @entity95 , where 27 goals in 29 games earned him a move to @entity106 who soon merged with @entity106 , a feeder side to their famous @entity110 namesake			1
@entity15 's potential was enough for @entity112 to sign him			2
joining in 1997 he scored nine goals to help them win the @entity115 in his first year , which eventually attracted the attentions of @entity118 's @entity39			2
although it did n't work out in @entity118 , his move to @entity121 's @entity40 was a roaring success			0
in the 2003/04 season he helped @entity124 's side win the @entity125 with @entity15 memorably grabbing two goals in the second round defeat of @entity128			2
@entity15 moved to @entity24 outfit @entity23 in 2006 and scored plenty of goals - he was in the top three league scorers in his debut season - but first - team opportunities have been limited of late			1
yet ever since @entity15 made his international debut in a 2 - 0 home defeat to @entity136 1997 , @entity6 has been a different side with him in it			2
gloom has followed @entity6 's footballing exploits before this summer 's @entity83			1
but after his most recent ' comeback ' , @entity6 fans will hope that @entity15 can help put the dark days under @entity62 firmly behind them			2
