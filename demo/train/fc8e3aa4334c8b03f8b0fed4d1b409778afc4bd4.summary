-- think back to the age before @entity2 , before gender - neutral @entity4 ovens , before " my princess boy " or " @entity7 " or " @entity8			2
" way before apps for infants or tv networks for toddlers , in the days when " @entity16 " was in its infancy			1
that 'd bring you to the early 1970s , when an album in a bright pink sleeve was passed among teachers , parents , librarians and kids			1
it was called " free to be ... @entity29 , " and record players around the country spun songs such as " @entity27 , " " parents are people " and " it 's all right to cry			1
" when it debuted in 1972 , there was nothing else like it -- at least , nothing so popular			2
it was feminist and multicultural ; an early childhood education in empathy ; multimedia before anybody used the word			2
there was the gold record album , a best - selling book and in 1974 , an @entity48 - and @entity47 - winning tv special that starred its creator , @entity49 , " and friends " -- literally , her formidable list of famous pals , including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and a young @entity58			1
more than 40 years later , there 's nostalgia in its opening chords and a legacy that still courses through classrooms			2
" children memorized every lyric and asked their parents and teacher to play the record over and over again , " @entity65 , a @entity65 magazine co-founder , wrote in the 2012 book " when we were @entity73 to be : looking back at a @entity74 and the difference it made			1
" " it challenged teachers to face up to their entrenched , often unacknowledged , gender biases and to cast a more critical eye on the books they were assigning , whom they called on most often in class , whom they allowed to dominate the block corner or the dress - up box			2
" the idea began with @entity90 , star of the sitcom " @entity92 , " and , in 1971 , a new auntie			0
her young niece 's storybooks were the same ones @entity90 had read as a kid , and recent entries to the bedtime canon reinforced that boys were pilots and doctors while girls were stewardesses and nurses			1
with the help of her friends and contacts , including poet @entity107 and co-producer @entity108 , the album and book were born			1
" honestly i was just trying to do something for one little girl , " @entity90 wrote in " when we were @entity73 to be			1
" " that it would grow to become a cultural phenomenon was never a part of the plan			0
" " @entity119 " was revolutionary for its kid - savvy and reach , but it was n't universally beloved			1
for every " @entity73 to be " class play , another school would n't acknowledge it			1
tv producers initially balked at a song that seemed to show @entity90 and @entity52 as an interracial couple			2
at least one tv critic warned parents to keep kids away from the television when " free to be " was on			1
@entity131 founder @entity130 criticized it and advocated for traditional gender roles in child - rearing			0
even its supporters argued that some of the skits were classist , and noted its bent toward traditional families with mommies , daddies and children			2
but its overall message lined up with shifting attitudes of the time , said @entity148 , a cultural historian and co-editor of " when we were @entity73 to be			1
" in the same year the " free to be " album debuted , president @entity152 signed @entity153 , @entity155 magazine began regular publication and tv 's " @entity157 " had an abortion , just months before @entity160 was decided			1
" there 's something distinct about the cultural moment it was produced , " @entity148 said			0
" ( @entity73 to be ) retained so much of that progressive , oppositional challenging the norm , and it did so in a way that made it palatable			1
" it fit into changing classrooms , too			0
educator @entity170 spent part of the 1970s creating a nonsexist , multicultural curriculum for preschoolers , she wrote in " when we were @entity73 to be			1
" it meant posters and toys that showed women as construction workers and african - americans as doctors -- materials she sometimes had to create on her own			2
she instructed educators to run with girls on the playground , to play dolls with boys and to be mindful of messages in books and music			0
" as happens in every movement , backsliding occurred , " @entity170 wrote , noting that plenty of toys were still sexualized , violent and color - coded by gender			0
" fortunately , classroom materials and children 's trade books continued to depict an increasingly nonsexist , multiracial and inclusive view of the world			2
" as a kid on @entity203 in the 1970s , @entity201 was a frustrated " free to be " fan			2
she wrote in " when we were @entity73 to be " about her feminist mom 's righteous letters and calls demanding her daughter be able take wood and mechanical shop , or that girls need not wait for boys to ask them to square dance			1
( @entity217 dancing , of course , being one way that schools satisfied @entity153 requirements			0
) to @entity201 's dismay , she had the same arguments at her child 's school decades later			0
@entity201 watched in the mornings as her daughter settled down to draw bubble letters with her gal pals while boys raced each other to the chessboards			0
the teacher said it was n't a problem ; it 's just what the kids chose			0
" after i nudged again and again , the teacher eventually taught all the children in the classroom how to play chess			2
some girls started to choose that as their morning activity , " wrote @entity201 , the author of " the @entity243			0
" " very often , " @entity201 wrote , " all it takes to outsmart gender stereotypes is a little creative thinking and a little gumption			0
" when we speak about feminism to adults , we tend to talk about negatives and things gone wrong			0
... ' free to be 's ' cheeriness still has the power to make our hearts sing			1
it 's a kind of feminism and a gender vision that is generous and likable and fun , all the things that feminism is usually accused of lacking			0
" but it has n't necessarily gotten easier to talk about gender roles in school , said @entity264 , an associate professor of history at the @entity266 and co-editor of " when we were @entity73 to be			1
" " i talk to a lot of teachers now who say they could n't show some of these things today , " @entity264 said			0
" there 's an anxiety about discussing something that might be seen as homosexual ; there 's anxiety about the school mentioning something that would be seen as negative or positive			0
" most educators - in - training are too young to remember the heyday of " @entity119 , " @entity264 said , and they would n't recognize a world where girls do n't have access to sports and bullying is encouraged			1
ideas that seemed so new in " @entity73 to be ... @entity29 " now turn up every day in " @entity289 , " " @entity290 " and long shelves of picture books			1
when @entity264 plays the music for college students now , she 'll sometimes see nods and smiles from those who could sing along , and raised eyebrows from first - timers			0
" it was so surprising and so contemporary , " @entity264 said			0
" they thought it was so new , and so exciting			0
" in fact , @entity264 said , she 's lost several copies to students who borrowed the cd and never brought it back			0
instead , they pass it around to others , just the way people heard it all those years ago			0
