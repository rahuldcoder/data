-- @entity1 , a 30 - year - old from @entity2 who studied health education , moves deliberately and concentrates on conversations like they 're chess matches			2
@entity6 , a 25 - year - old chemist and musician from @entity8 , walks quickly and can carry on multiple conversations simultaneously			0
one year ago , they did n't know each other			0
now , as colleagues , roommates and confidants , they are working to become leaders of our next big social movement -- the fight for health equity			1
@entity1 and @entity6 work side by side out of identical , windowless offices at @entity24 's @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity26			0
as health counselors , they are in charge of the medical intake and well - being of 40 homeless youth			0
the only part of their demanding day that is consistent is the morning -- they are greeted with a hug when they get to work			0
the two were placed at @entity24 by @entity40			2
founded in 2009 , @entity40 's mission is to mobilize young leaders from diverse professional and cultural backgrounds to promote global health equity			1
@entity40 recruits and trains emerging leaders , then places them in one of seven countries to work with a health non-profit or government office for a yearlong fellowship in order to strengthen and learn from the organization			1
this week , @entity1 and @entity6 will complete their year of service and become @entity40 alumni as a new class of 106 fellows joins the movement to serve with 44 partner organizations			1
our advocacy for health equity is fueled by the belief that access to quality health care is a human right			1
at @entity40 , we believe the poor , who are burdened the most by disease , deserve our highest quality of care			1
we know many of the 1.7 million deaths from hiv / aids worldwide can be prevented with better access to antiretroviral medicine			0
we are motivated by the overwhelming costs of health care for the poor and the fact that more than 60 % of bankruptcies in the @entity83 are caused by medical expenses			1
these challenges are daunting , but can be met			0
we at @entity40 believe the following four principles are vital to the movement 's success : 1			1
young people should be at the center of this cause more undergraduate students in @entity93 are linking arms and demanding global health curricula while building up community organizing skills			2
@entity97 , a nonprofit founded in 2007 by students at @entity99 that partners with grassroots health organizations around the world , has spread to 55 universities and is joined by several new health organizations			2
yet , a scarcity of opportunities and lack of a supportive global health community keeps too many skilled young professionals from fulfilling their potential after college			2
it 's a moral imperative to provide young people opportunities in the global health space			2
the leaders must be global @entity40 has a partnership model where one fellow is always paired with an international fellow			1
we see our 90 current fellows , who come from 12 countries , sharing challenges and ideas daily , via social media , impromptu gatherings and in - person retreats			0
the exchange of best practices in this globally connected social movement is not just from the @entity83 outward			1
it is a collaboration that has no boundaries			0
for example , our fellows at @entity135 's @entity134 program in @entity136 improved care for low - income @entity140 patients by adopting best practices from community health worker programs implemented in rural @entity144 and @entity145			1
complex challenges require diverse skills doctors and nurses are vital to the movement for health equity but our next transformational leaders could be from non-traditional health fields such as computer science , economics , or communications			1
this year , @entity40 fellows with architecture backgrounds , working with the @entity159 in @entity145 , oversaw the construction of hospitals that use the latest theories of design for efficient care			2
our new class of fellows represents 45 fields of expertise			0
organizations must take a humble approach we should stand with , and learn from , those we seek to serve			0
health programs should be staffed and led by those in the community who are being served			0
we should also work in partnership with both the public and private sectors to reach more people			0
without these partnerships we will fail			0
after the fellowship , @entity1 will partner with another @entity40 alum in @entity2 to establish an organization to serve orphans and other at - risk youth			2
@entity6 will study medicine at @entity188 and focus on community health			0
after providing care to hundreds of at - risk youth and receiving hundreds of morning hugs this year , they are ready to lead in the movement for health equity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 and @entity199 .			1

@entity198 , @entity199 : join us in the fight for health equity
@entity205 , @entity199 : we believe that access to health care for all is a human right
they say young leaders can participate in @entity40 to help the world
this social movement will help *foster* best practices in health equity , they say
