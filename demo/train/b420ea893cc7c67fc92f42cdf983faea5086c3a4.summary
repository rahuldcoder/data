" it 's a mantra you hear in the tech - startup world -- a reminder to chase your dreams even if you need to pick up the pieces and start from scratch every now and then			1
of course , some failures work out better than others			0
this year saw its share of technology - driven missteps			2
some were rare slip - ups by usually reliable tech titans			1
others were folks who crashed the world stage via the @entity20 's powerful echo chamber , got lambasted for their efforts , then disappeared to presumably never be heard from again			2
among them all , it was n't hard to fill the top spot on this year 's list of " tech fails			1
" there are lots of arguments for and against the @entity29 , president @entity30 's signature health care law that has opened access to insurance for millions of @entity33			2
but there 's no debating that the rollout of its website , where millions of people would presumably sign up for care under the act , was a disaster			1
some painted it as a stark contrast between the nimble , flexible world of @entity47 startups and the unwieldy snarl of @entity50 bureacracy			0
regardless , the glitch - filled launch gave critics of the plan plenty of ammunition at a time when supporters would have preferred to be extolling the virtues of the health care plan			0
of course , the full - time techies were n't perfect this year , either			2
after unveiling its successful video app , @entity63 , @entity61 launched an uncharacteristic clunker in @entity65 , a streaming tool that nobody seemed to notice			1
once - mighty @entity68 watched its dwindling relevance erode to almost zero in 2013 , while @entity70 learned that taking on the @entity71 is n't easy as its surface tablet struggled to find an audience			0
@entity75 's tinkering with its e-mail service frustrated users -- although not as much as a handful of major outages			1
and @entity80 learned that being the world 's most popular social network does n't mean people want a smartphone that 's been reskinned with @entity80 features			1
smartwatches were part of one of the year 's top tech stories , the emergence of wearable technology			1
but by the end of 2013 , none of the devices had lived up to all the hype			0
perhaps spoiled by the capabilities of their smartphones and tablets , many users felt the connected watches just do n't do very much ... yet			0
and it would n't be a year in the digital age without people using their web access in regrettable , embarrassing and sometimes just plain stupid ways			0
be it overzealous crime - fighters on @entity108 , restaurant owners ranting on @entity80 or the rest of us leaping at the chance to believe , and share , phony stories , there were plenty instances of people posting first and thinking later			0
take a look at our @entity119 of 2013 and let us know in the comments if there are any you think we missed .			0

in 2013 , the @entity125 website topped our list of tech ' fails '
@entity65 was a rare misstep for the hot social *platform*
@entity75 's e-mail troubles irked users
the " year of the @entity138 hoax " saw us believing in bunk
