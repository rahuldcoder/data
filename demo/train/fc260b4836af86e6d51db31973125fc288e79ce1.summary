@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 separatist group @entity7 's cease - fire statement is insufficient , @entity1 's interior minister said monday			1
interior minister @entity10 , in the government 's first major reaction , said that the statement , released to media sunday , is " very far from the minimums " that the @entity1 government has laid out for the group			1
" the word ' truce ' as a concept of limited peace to have a dialogue is dead			0
that 's the past , " @entity10 told @entity1 state television @entity21			0
he said the government 's demand remains steadfast -- that @entity7 agree to unconditionally lay down its arms and end the violence forever , with a process to verify that			1
@entity10 said security forces would not let up on @entity7 during its unilateral cease - fire , and he said @entity7 called the cease - fire at a time of " extreme weakness , " due to police crackdowns against the group			1
@entity7 has announced cease - fires before and broken them , notably the 2006 cease - fire that was announced as " permanent , " only to be broken months later with a car bomb at @entity0 's airport that killed two people			1
in a statement published on the website of @entity5 newspaper @entity45 on sunday , @entity7 -- which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for @entity5 independence in northern @entity1 and southwest @entity50 -- " calls on the @entity1 government to agree to the the minimum democratic solutions toward a peace process			1
" the latest cease - fire announcement was not unexpected , following weeks of calls for a new peace process by some smaller leftist @entity5 political parties			2
the cease - fire announcement also follows months of what is widely regarded as a successful police crackdown against @entity7 operatives in @entity1 and also in @entity7 's hideouts in neighboring @entity50 and @entity64			1
police have arrested many of @entity7 's suspected top operatives , as well as many @entity7 foot soldiers , and seized bomb - making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches , virtually shutting off @entity7 attacks			0
in its cease - fire announcement sunday , @entity7 said that " months ago it decided not to carry out armed offensive actions , " but made no mention of what it might consider a " defensive " action			1
the announcement was accompanied by an @entity7 video which showed three apparent @entity7 members seated at a table in front of an @entity7 banner			0
they wore white hoods covering their faces			0
the hoods had eye holes , but their mouths were covered			0
the person in the middle apeared to do all the speaking in the ancient @entity5 language -- not in @entity1 -- and the voice seemed to be that of a woman			0
@entity7 is listed as a terrorist group by the @entity98 and the @entity99 for its campaign of car bombings and shootings			0
the @entity1 government of prime minister @entity104 began a peace process in 2006 during the last unilateral @entity7 cease - fire , but after @entity7 's airport bomb , the government called off negotiations			1
since then , officials of @entity104 's government have said they would not accept a simple cease - fire statement			1
instead , they have said they will accept only a definitive statement from @entity7 to end its armed fight , and to announce when and where it would lay down its arms forever			1
only then would the government be willing to consider leniency for some of the more than 500 @entity7 prisoners in jail , officials have said			0
the @entity5 region in northern @entity1 already has considerable home - rule authority , with its own police , parliament , taxing power and control of health and education			0
but @entity7 rejects those as partial steps , and has fought for full independence			0
@entity7 's goal is an independent @entity5 nation comprising the three - province @entity5 region and the neighboring @entity136 region in @entity1 , along with three departments in southwest @entity50 that also have @entity5 roots			0
about three million people live in those areas now			0
@entity7 's cease - fire statement called on the international community to get involved in the @entity5 peace process			1
on sunday , the leader of the @entity145 in @entity146 said he supported the cease - fire			2
" @entity151 has welcomed @entity7 cease - fire announcement , " the @entity145 party said on its @entity150 page			2
while @entity7 has announced cease - fires before , the absence of government involvement makes sunday 's statement unique , said @entity157 , a correspondent for the @entity1 newspaper @entity158			1
past announcements have come after back - channel negotiations between government officials and @entity7 , @entity157 said			2
but this time , it was smaller leftist @entity5 political parties that appeared to have pushed @entity7 to make the cease - fire			2
the most significant of those parties is @entity166 , which is outlawed because the courts have found it is not independent , but a very part of @entity7			0
@entity10 , @entity1 's interior minister , said that if @entity166 wants to get back into local politics and run candidates in elections next year , it must either make a full and convincing break from @entity7 , or convince @entity7 itself to end its armed struggle .			2

interior minister says cease - fire statement does not meet government 's requirements
@entity1 government officials have said the group must agree to lay down its arms forever
@entity7 is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for independence
