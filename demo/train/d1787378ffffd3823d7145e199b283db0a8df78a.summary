a powerful reaction to women - hater @entity2 's killing rampage friday night has been the @entity5 hashtag # @entity3 , where women point out how misogyny and sexism damage them and restrict their lives			1
it emerged in response to the common , misguided argument that " not all men " are like that			0
of course not all men are like @entity2			1
but he is the product of a culture that condones and in many cases endorses the belief that if you are a " nice guy " -- or a " supreme gentleman " as @entity2 described himself -- you are somehow entitled to sex with women			1
gun control , campus safety and mental illness are all issues raised by the massacre , but hatred of women concerns me most			2
i am the founder of @entity31 , which fights " slut shaming " and sexual bullying in our schools and communities			2
i 'm also a graduate student at @entity37 , @entity37 , where the rampage took place			0
why # @entity40 took off on @entity5 @entity2 and others like him believe that sex is a reward to be earned , not a consensual activity between adults who respect each other , and that women are prizes to be won , not actual people with the agency to make decisions about their own bodies			1
nowhere is this mindset more obvious than in the reactions of some men who actually sympathize with @entity2			1
many of these men are self - described @entity57 , or @entity58 , who employ a series of strict rules in order to manipulate women into having sex with them , referring to those women as their " targets			1
" @entity2 allegedly participated in forums on the site @entity68 , which criticizes @entity57 not because of their obviously misogynist tactics , but because those tactics did n't work for him and other @entity68 members			1
the site shut down saturday morning with the message : " @entity68 is about to get a massive amount of press , " according to the watchdog @entity76			0
after the killings , the extent of misogyny in this community was revealed in the creation of a facebook page called " @entity2 is an @entity83 , " with the advice for everyone to " share your thoughts and pay your respects to @entity2 here			1
also , view this final message from our beloved hero , " which links to his videotaped rant , with commenters expressing solidarity with his desire for revenge against women			1
the page has since been taken down			2
the creator of the popular @entity57 site " @entity101 " -- where " women and homosexuals are prohibited from commenting " -- claimed , " more people will die unless you give men sexual options			1
" " @entity109 " sites like @entity101 admire " alpha males , " disparage " beta males , " and promote hypermasculinity			1
but again , most men are not members of these hate communities and not all men hold similar beliefs			1
that 's not the point			0
these views are just extreme versions of very common , socially acceptable ideas about women and sex			1
@entity2 was undoubtedly mentally unstable , but some of the sexist ideas in his manifesto are , unfortunately , not the invention of a madman			1
this is the first time i have publicly identified myself as a graduate student at @entity37			0
i founded @entity31 by blogging my own middle school diary , so i use a pen name and guard my identity in order to protect people i mentioned in those diary entries			2
but in the wake of this crisis , i want to speak out			0
the university has responded in an admirable way : setting up a 24 - hour call center and extensive counseling options to help students cope , establishing the @entity37			0
@entity147 to honor the victims , and organizing campuswide memorial events			0
opinion : shooter 's rage at women too familiar in @entity154 as the details of @entity2 's history and the crime itself continue to emerge , we will have a better idea of the institutional steps that could have been taken to prevent it			1
we will write letters to our representatives and use our votes to speak up about what we believe should be done to prevent future tragedies			0
but in the meantime , on a personal level , we need to take responsibility for our own reactions to this story			0
we teach our children from a young age that a girl 's value as a human being is inextricably linked to her sexual behavior			2
her virginity is something to be " given up " or even " lost			0
" sex with her is a prize to be won -- and she herself is equated with that " prize			2
" in stark contrast , boys are taught that their virginity is something to be ashamed of			0
their masculinity depends on sexual prowess and physical dominance			0
it is from this understanding that the @entity57 movement arises , populated by boys and men who feel worthless because they do n't have sex			2
their anger is directed at the women -- the " prizes " -- who refuse to " give " them what they feel they deserve			1
so where do we go from here ? although it brought to light the various struggles of women across the country , # @entity40 is , ultimately , just a hashtag			2
when it does , let 's continue the conversation outside the realm of social media			0
tuesday afternoon , i will join the rest of the @entity37 community at a memorial service for @entity2 's victims			1
as we mourn @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , and @entity232 , conversations will focus on their lives , personalities , and accomplishments			0
but as we move forward and try to make sense of what happened , it 's our responsibility to start productive , respectful conversations about the misogyny behind @entity2 's actions			2
instead of avoiding talking about sex , let 's start age - appropriate conversations with our children about consent and respect			1
let 's speak up when a man in our group of friends speaks disrespectfully about a woman he 's had sex with			0
and most important , let 's analyze our own assumptions about what sex means with regard to different genders			0
most men are not killers like @entity2			2
most men do n't sympathize with his motives			0
but all of us , regardless of gender , can contribute to changing the misogynist culture that inspired him .			0

@entity266 : @entity2 is part of a culture that says nice guys are entitled to sex with women
@entity266 : extremely misogynistic sites promote view that women are prizes , not actual people
@entity266 : facebook page created by *proponents* was called " @entity2 is an @entity83 "
she says we need to *eradicate* this hate by openly talking about it to children , communities
