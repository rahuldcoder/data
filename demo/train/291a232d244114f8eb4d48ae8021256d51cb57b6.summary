@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was the world 's first multinational company , a trading giant during the colonial rule of the @entity8 subcontinent			1
this week , @entity9 is being reborn as a luxury brand -- under @entity8 ownership			1
@entity12 , an @entity8 - born importer and entrepreneur , bought the intellectual property rights to the company in 2005 , after they had lain dormant for a century			1
his goal was to create a global luxury brand			1
his dream is realized in a new store off @entity0 's high - end @entity21 , where the new @entity9 now sells gourmet tea , chocolate , coffee and gifts			1
" its name has a huge relationship with all that is high - end products , " @entity12 said			2
the @entity9 began as a trading monopoly under queen elizabeth i in 1600 to ship commodities to the @entity33 from @entity8 , @entity34 and the @entity35 , countering the clout of the @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
at various times , the company controlled the trade in indigo dye , cotton , silk , opium and tea			2
the " tea library " at the new store features more than 100 different types including green , black , herbal , and flavored teas			2
" there would not be tea on the tables of @entity0 but for @entity56 , " @entity12 said			0
" so , in a way , we own this category			0
" in time , the company and @entity62 colonialism became one and the same			0
it was the company 's tea that was dumped in @entity66 in 1773 , and the company once controlled @entity68 and @entity8			1
" it brought all the exotic foods from the @entity71 to the @entity33 , " @entity12 said			0
that idea is infused in the goods for sale at the store , from @entity77 mustard to chocolate and biscuits flavored with sea salt and red peppercorns			0
the @entity62 crown slowly took control of the company 's routes , ports , currency and military , becoming the symbol of the @entity62 empire			0
in 1874 , the company ceased trading , prompting an obituary in the @entity95 newspaper now inscribed in a marble table at the new store : " it accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other company ever attempted , or is ever to attempt in the years to come			2
" the company 's name may also remind some of the illegal opium trade from @entity34 , and oppression and wars in @entity8			1
@entity12 , however , sees another side in his native @entity8			1
" the @entity109 language , the ports , the railway system , the civil system ... the bridges -- all was built by @entity56 , " he said			0
" so there 's a huge relationship between @entity56 and various walks of life			0
it is not just food products			2
" @entity12 said he has invested around $ 20 million in the company so far			0
he hopes to open more stores and launch leather goods , jewelry and home interiors , plans that will take an additional $ 100 million , he said .			0
