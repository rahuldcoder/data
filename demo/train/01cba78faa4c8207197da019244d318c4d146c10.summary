@entity0 -- i was at the last public speech by the former @entity5 ambassador to @entity7 @entity6			1
during the q & a session , a @entity7 student asked the outgoing ambassador to compare the @entity7 dream and the @entity5 dream			2
the ambassador said he did n't know much about the @entity7 dream , so he talked instead about the @entity5 dream			2
like @entity5 , the @entity7 people also have their dreams -- a powerful country , a good education , a happy family , or a bountiful harvest			0
yet the dreams of the ordinary @entity7 have never been articulated as powerfully and eloquently as the @entity23 , until @entity24 came into power			2
opinion : @entity7 's awkward ' banana ' slip @entity24 first mentioned the term " the @entity7 dream " during his tour of an exhibit at the @entity33 in november 2012 , shortly after he became leader of the @entity35			1
that exhibit is called the @entity36 , and @entity24 said the @entity7 dream is the great rejuvenation of the @entity7 nation			1
then on march 17 , 2013 , @entity24 fully spelled out his thoughts about the @entity7 dream in his first public speech as the newly elected president of @entity7			1
" the @entity7 dream is the dream of the whole nation , as well as of every individual , " he said			2
" the @entity7 dream , after all , is the dream of the people			1
we must realize it by closely depending on the people , and we must incessantly bring benefits to the people			0
" publicity campaign after his speech , the @entity7 dream has entered the daily discourse of both the @entity7 government and the ordinary @entity7 , thanks in no small part to the government 's massive publicity campaign			1
there were countless speeches , contests , essay competitions , scholarly conferences , and tv shows that had the @entity7 dream as the central theme			2
if there had been a contest for the most popular @entity7 phrase in 2013 , the @entity7 dreams would probably have won the title			0
apart from nationwide publicity , there are other reasons why the @entity7 dream has become a household phrase			1
it is much less elusive than @entity81 's thoughts , @entity83 's theories , @entity85 's @entity84 , or @entity87 's @entity86 ; it is a term that can be understood by any @entity7			0
besides , who does n't have dreams ? thus it easily resonates with the @entity7 people			0
finally , @entity24 promised to realize the dream by depending more on the people and bringing more benefits to them			2
thus @entity24 's dream , at least in its rhetorical form , is a dream for the people , by the people , and of the people			1
who does n't like such a dream ? reforms and @entity24 meant what he said , at least in one area and that is corruption , the most urgent issue facing the @entity7 community party			1
he has launched an unprecedented crackdown on corruption , and 20 high - ranking officials -- vice-minister level and above -- have been investigated or punished within a little more than year			0
he also signed two documents -- eight regulations and @entity117 -- that have significantly improved bureaucratic efficiency and sharply reduced public expenses on receptions , overseas travel , and vehicle purchases			0
because of @entity24 's tough campaign , @entity7 's entertainment businesses , particularly top - end restaurants , clubs , and hotels , have suffered enormous losses , over which the ordinary @entity7 are rightfully gloating			1
rampant corruption , be it bribery , buying and selling offices , illegal land grabs , or abuse of power , is certainly the biggest scourge of @entity7 today , leading to rising discontent and unrest as well as declining public trust in government			1
most importantly , corruption seems to have made it increasingly difficult for the ordinary @entity7 to have their dreams come true			0
restoring confidence @entity7 is becoming economically and militarily much more powerful , and the average @entity7 is living a much better life			0
yet at the same time more and more @entity7 seem to have lost faith in the government and the future of @entity7			0
a prosperous and powerful @entity7 should be a land of opportunities for its people , but actually it appears to have become a land of anger and despair for an increasing number of @entity7			0
thus @entity24 's articulation of the @entity7 dream and his campaign against corruption can be viewed as the first steps by the new @entity7 leadership to restore public confidence in the party and the government			1
thus far , his policies have won enthusiastic support among most @entity7 , and @entity24 has become arguably the most popular leader since @entity83			2
if the dreams of the ordinary @entity7 today -- like those of their ancestors in ancient @entity7 -- depend on the good luck of having a sage leader , however , that means @entity7 is still under the rule of man , not rule of law			0
when that leader steps down , or if that leader makes disastrous decisions , the dreams of the @entity7 people will be in jeopardy			0
with immense popular support at the moment , president @entity24 should initiate institutional reforms that empower every @entity7 to have dreams and to have those dreams come true			1
these reforms will not only set @entity7 on a path of sustainable political and economic development , but also enable the @entity7 people to be truly proud of the @entity7 dream , just as @entity5 are proud of the @entity5 dream			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

march *14* marks one year since @entity24 was officially *appointed* @entity7 's president
after @entity24 's first presidential speech , the " @entity7 dream " became a household phrase
@entity24 's campaign against corruption can be seen as the first steps to restore public trust , says @entity196
@entity196 says reforms will enable all people in @entity7 to be truly proud of the @entity7 dream
