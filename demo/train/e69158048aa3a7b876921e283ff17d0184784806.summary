@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 commemorated victims of the march 11 , 2004 @entity0 train bombings with somber ceremonies on tuesday at three stations in the capital where 191 people died in the @entity10 terrorist attacks			1
a bouquet of flowers for a victim of the 2004 bombings is attached to railings near @entity16 station			0
@entity17 and prime minister @entity18 attended the main ceremony at @entity16 , where most of the casualties came when bombs exploded on one train inside the station and a second on the tracks just outside			1
some of the survivors of the attack , which left 1,800 people wounded , gathered with the king and prime minister at the train bombing monument -- a circular glass structure in front of the station that was inaugurated on the third anniversary of the attacks			1
there were no speeches , just the placement of a floral wreath and the performance of " @entity40 , " a song for peace , by an orchestral and choir ensemble			0
other smaller memorials were held at the @entity47 and @entity48 stations down the line from @entity16 , where the other two trains were torn apart by explosions four years ago			0
" this year it was especially delicate to reach the anniversary , " @entity52 , who lost a son in the bombings and is president of the march 11 @entity56 , told @entity1 radio network @entity57 " everything has been stirred up again			1
" @entity18 won an upset victory in 2004 three days after the bombings , and was re-elected last sunday			2
a @entity1 court last october convicted 21 people in connection with the attacks			1
seventeen of those were @entity10 terrorists and four were @entity1 who were sentenced for supplying explosives stolen from a @entity1 mining operation that ended up being used in the attacks			2
various appeals to that sentence are still pending before @entity1 's @entity76 , which is expected to rule on the cases later this year			0
a few other suspects thought to be linked to the bombings could yet face trial , including two in @entity82 and another in @entity1			0
authorities say @entity1 remains under constant threat from @entity10 terrorism			0
@entity86 reports regularly mention @entity1 -- among other countries -- as a target , and more than 300 suspected @entity10 extremists have been arrested in the country since the bombings			2
besides the train bombing trial , a separate trial concluded last month with the convictions of 20 men , mainly @entity95 and @entity82 , for @entity10 terrorist activity in @entity1			1
in another case , a judge held in prison for investigation 10 men , mainly @entity101 , who were arrested last january in @entity102 on suspicion of planning @entity86 style attacks in @entity1 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
