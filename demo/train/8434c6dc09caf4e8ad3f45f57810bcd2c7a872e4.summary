-- " you guys are crack addicts			1
" that was @entity5 on " @entity6 , " addressing journalists about their obsession with the 2016 presidential campaign , more than three years away			1
the former @entity11 governor was joking and it 's a fool 's errand for anyone in the media to pretend to be offended			2
but as always , humor contains a kernel of truth			0
although the press corps is n't collectively hitting the glass pipe , we are more than a little obsessive - compulsive when it comes to talking about the next election			1
after all , the last presidential election just ended four months ago			1
the midterm elections are still 18 months away			1
this is the time for governing -- that rare sweet spot in a two - term administration where @entity30 is not paralyzed by the immediate prospect of re-election and the president has maximum political capital to spend on the priorities that define a legacy			1
there is plenty of political drama to go around -- the sequester cuts kicking in , a full court press for a grand bargain in the face of another debt ceiling debacle , a budget battle , the most heated gun control debate in two decades and the first real chance at a bipartisan immigration overhaul in more than a generation			2
and that 's just the looming legislative agenda in addition to the internecine fights on @entity55			0
but budget fights make us sleepy and even the prospect of national default feels a little like @entity60			0
overall , we do n't really pay attention to scandals unless sex is involved , no matter how much money or honor is stolen			0
instead we reflexively fast forward to the next election , looking for a quick fix -- a race that allows us to talk about the comparatively simple world of winners and losers			1
the media does a great job covering campaigns but no so much when it comes to covering governing			1
in the process , we almost forget that governing is the main event -- the prize that all those candidates strive for in the campaign			2
there 's plenty of collusion			0
@entity5 is n't innocent -- he trotted out to every sunday show to promote his new book with @entity88 on immigration , knowing that the widespread interest was driven by speculation about a 2016 presidential campaign			1
moreover , with the merciless metrics of journalism in the internet age , editors know that stories on the sequester do n't have the same clickability rate as sex scandals , murders and celebrity gossip			0
i have no problem with a high - low approach to story selection , and i 'm not immune from writing about future elections			2
but there 's an obligation to focus primarily on current events , aiming to educate as we entertain			1
otherwise , our country starts hurtling toward a world of bread and circuses instead of inspiring the kind of active citizenry that democracy ultimately depends upon			0
i 'm not trying to idolize a fictitious journalistic past , where newspapers , radio and television focused solely on civic substance rather than sensationalism			0
and although the rise of partisan media has fueled distrust of journalism and segregates people into separate political realities , the deeper bias at work in media is not necessarily liberal or conservative			2
it 's more a conflict bias that steers us toward covering the horse race of campaigning rather than the legislative sausage - making that comes with governing			1
the best television journalists and @entity142 columnists -- from @entity143 and @entity144 to @entity145 and @entity146 -- were able to communicate the drama of decision - making by people temporarily in power and even help elevate the outcome by harnessing the weight of public opinion			1
the everyday challenge of journalism is to entertain while we educate			2
and that requires focusing on present challenges rather than just projecting far into the future to the next election , imagining a simpler time when all problems will be solved by a change in power			1
crack addict ? not exactly			0
but like an addict , we are always lurching toward the next fix , dragging national debate along with us			0
it 's time to sober up and focus on the drama - fueled main event happening right in front of us			1
we might even help fix a few problems by infusing the process of solving them with a sense of civic urgency			0
instead of defaulting to speculation about the next election			0
it 's not easy , but then very little worthwhile in life is			0
as @entity184 once wrote , " to see what is in front of one 's nose needs a constant struggle			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : @entity5 called journalists " crack addicts " for obsessing about 2016 election
midterms 18 months away , he says , this is time for governing , not campaigning
@entity192 : media addicted to *excitement* of a horse race , but is so - so at covering governing
@entity192 : drama enough in current events ; media should educate as it entertains
