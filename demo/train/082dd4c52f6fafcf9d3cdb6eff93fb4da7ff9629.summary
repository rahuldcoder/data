-- this year has seen @entity3 morph into a chameleon , @entity2 perform as a parrot , @entity1 play a panda and @entity7 turn into a @entity8			1
a-list celebrities are now scratching at casting directors ' doors in their eagerness to voice animated creatures -- a move that would once have been considered professional suicide			1
" there was a sense that actors who did animated work were n't at the top of their game career-wise , " said @entity17 editor @entity16			1
" there was a stigma surrounding it			2
" then @entity26 let the genie out of the bottle in 1992 's " @entity29 , " magically transforming voice actors from faceless fill - ins to sought - after stars			1
" when @entity26 came in -- whose career was flying at the time -- it showed people there was no stigma in animated work , and it opened the floodgates , " said @entity16			1
" the success of that movie made film execs think , ' we 've hit on something -- if we get celebrity actors in these roles , it will generate box office			0
' " a roll call of big - name actors has followed -- from @entity51 as @entity52 in " @entity53 " and @entity54 as " @entity55 's " wisecracking @entity56 , to @entity57 as the " fantastic mr @entity58			2
" for studios , the draw is obvious : a bankable name on the poster that will entice parents -- the ones ultimately buying the tickets			0
" if you can make parents think it 's not going to be a painful two hours , that 's a big advantage , " said @entity16			2
" for adults , knowing there are a-list stars in a film adds a level of curiosity and an inclination to go and see it			1
" they went to see ' @entity79 ' with @entity80 because he was in it , and ' @entity82 ' because they wanted to hear @entity84 in an animation			0
" a celebrity is also infinitely more useful than an unknown voice actor in terms of @entity89 , since they can be sent onto chat shows and red carpets			2
for the a-listers themselves , animated films are now seen as credible projects -- even , since 2001 , honored with their own category at the @entity98			2
and with the success of the sector in recent years , animated films have become epic productions with budgets for a-list salaries			1
according to @entity105 , " @entity106 " and " @entity107 " both grossed over $ 400 million			0
inevitably , there 's still the sneaking suspicion that actors regard voice work as a cushy number			1
as @entity1 , who voices @entity117 in " @entity118 , " out later this year , quips : " well obviously i do n't have to do costume and make - up , and it 's an easy piece of pie			2
just role out of bed in your pjs and rock the mike for a few hours a month , and you 've got a real cool movie			0
" that 's galling for traditional voice actors , who regard theirs as a well - honed craft -- and who are increasingly consigned to bit parts			1
artists like the late @entity134 , the " @entity139 " -- who brought @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 to life -- made successful careers out of their ability to voice multiple characters , often in the same film			1
their flexibility remains their trump card in the era of star casting , while celebrities ultimately need to sound enough like themselves to be recognized			0
" that 's the name of this game -- versatility , " @entity149 , a veteran voice actor best known for being @entity150 , told @entity0			1
" the more versatile you are , the better chances you have of getting hired			0
it 's not enough to just have one voice			1
" in " @entity159 , " @entity158 not only voices @entity150 , but other characters including @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
far from being a cushy job , @entity158 says voice work is a performance -- and one that requires actors to find the physicality of the character , just as they would in a live - action film			1
the way @entity158 holds herself changes when she is about to say a line as @entity150 , and she often gets so into character that she starts ad - libbing -- once snapping " eat my shorts " at a colleague and inadvertently creating a famous catchphrase			0
@entity1 got similarly carried away as his martial - artist bear , ad - libbing so often that co-star @entity183 had to be brought back in to re-record scenes that had changed			1
" i go headlong and really try and get into the fur of my panda character , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
" i do n't think about what it 's like to live on a bamboo diet all of my life , but just the emotional reality of the scene ... i think you tend to overcompensate because you do n't have the face and the eyes			0
" the production team helped @entity1 and @entity183 imagine what each scene would eventually look like			2
" they are really great about showing us images , footage , something -- even if it 's just a sculpture of your animal , " said @entity1			0
" they give as much as they can to give a sense ( of it )			0
but sometimes you really have to ask , because they give you five lines and you say your lines loads of times and they say , ' no , no , no , you do n't understand -- while you are saying this you are dropping from the top of a 500ft building ! ' " a-list stars , however , do n't always guarantee success			1
a recent big - screen version of " @entity221 " failed to impress , despite help from @entity223 and @entity224			0
" there is no direct correlation between the big name and the size of box office -- it 's more : is it a good marriage between the actor and the character they 're voicing ? " said @entity16			0
" that 's the key about animation -- it 's about correct casting , not stunt casting			0
