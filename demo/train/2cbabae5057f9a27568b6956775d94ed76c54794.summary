-- @entity1 -- host of " @entity2 " and unabashed right wing radical -- is now considering running for @entity4			1
simply put : @entity1 must be stopped ! he is an existential threat to our way of life and to the exceptional nature of our nation			1
i know some will dismiss the threat posed by @entity1 -- these apologists will defend him as " harmless " or say he 's no more than " a charismatic speaker " -- but that is exactly what they said about @entity17			1
we need to wake up to the fact that @entity1 's poll numbers in @entity20 -- the location of the next @entity23 primary -- are rising			1
he is now at 5 % , placing him ahead of former @entity27 gov. @entity26			2
yes , some will scoff at @entity1 running ahead of @entity26 -- a candidate running below the margin of error in some polls , meaning he may have zero support or may actually owe votes -- but keep in mind that in the recent @entity37 caucus , @entity26 received 745 votes			1
translation : @entity1 is for real			1
@entity1 has not been hiding his extreme views			1
night after night ( or four nights a week to be exact ) @entity1 has been spewing his venom			1
however , for some reason , the media have given him a free pass			2
here are @entity1 's positions on the key issues -- i warn you , they are scary : -- unemployment : " suck it up , unemployed			1
it is your own damn fault that you do n't have a job ... so stop scapegoating @entity57			2
" do we really want an @entity60 president who sides with @entity57 over workers ? -- corporate taxes : " if we raise taxes on corporations , what incentive will they have to make money other than the fact that it 's the sole reason they exist			2
" @entity1 is clearly in the pocket of big business -- i bet his super pac is funded by big businesses like hedge funds and casino owners			1
-- government helping @entity60 in need : " i believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps			2
i believe it is possible			2
i saw this guy do it once in @entity84			2
it was magical ! " -- gays : " there is nothing wrong with being gay			0
i have plenty of friends who are going to hell			0
" even @entity93 would not say this ( at least not in public			0
) -- @entity60 's role in world : " if our @entity99 wanted us to care about the rest of the world , they would n't have declared their independence from it			0
" under a @entity1 administration , it appears @entity60 would just attack other countries for no valid reason			1
-- immigration : " this is @entity60			0
i do n't want my tomato picked by a @entity112			0
i want it picked by an @entity60 , then sliced by a @entity114 , and served by a @entity115 in a spa where a @entity117 gives me a @entity118			0
" and he advocates arresting illegal immigrants and throwing them in " jail -- then we can force them to pick our crops as prison labor			0
" -- civil rights : " i just think @entity125 was overrated			0
last time i checked , she got famous for breaking the law			0
" even @entity129 , whose past newsletters contained racist comments , would be appalled by this callous remark			0
-- muslims : " every permit granted to a mosque is one denied to an @entity60 house of worship			0
" @entity1 is to the right of @entity139 on this issue , and keep in mind @entity139 has compared @entity135 to @entity142			1
these above quotes are clearly the words of a man with no regard for the values of our great nation			0
why do the media coddle @entity1 just because he labels himself a " comedian " ? @entity17 told jokes -- does that mean he was ok ? and not only are @entity1 's views on the radical fringe of @entity60 society , i do n't trust him			1
why ? because his positions on the issues have remained constant			0
he does n't waver or have multiple opinions on the same issue			0
in contrast , a person like @entity163 has evolved over time and has been on both sides of issues like abortion , gay marriage and health insurance			0
( @entity163 should embrace this with the campaign slogan : " me , too ! " ) @entity1 has only two qualities i like : 1			1
he 's a friend of @entity175 and 2			0
besides that , he is a danger to our @entity179			0
and let 's not forget that @entity1 admitted that he makes up facts to support his own political arguments , as he gleefully boasted once : " i ca n't prove it , but i can say it			1
" @entity60 can not afford a man with the views of @entity1 running our nation			1
@entity1 does n't belong in the @entity190 , instead he belongs on basic cable right before reruns of " scrubs			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2
