-- the @entity1 on monday took away some of the government 's power to tighten emission standards , but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases			1
in a 5 - 4 decision , the justices affirmed conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases blamed for global warming are pollutants			2
although it concluded that the @entity17 could not completely extend its regulatory authority for limiting the expansion or building of new facilities like power plants			1
the ruling , on a case seen as a major test of executive authority , gave both sides of the politically charged debate some reason to celebrate			1
but it also may have the longer term effect of extending legal fights for years			2
many conservative groups have characterized president @entity34 as misusing his power and ignoring the will of @entity37			1
industry has complained that the administration has used its power to include the development of power plants and other stationary infrastructure			1
businesses worry any unchecked expansion of rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools , small businesses , and shopping malls			2
the court agreed to some extent			2
justice @entity53 said the " @entity17 's rewriting of the statute was impermissible			1
" but the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end , since @entity17 can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases			1
" @entity17 is getting almost everything it wanted in this case , " said @entity53			1
the agency responded positively to the decision			0
" today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations , " it said in a statement			0
the government is now expected to continue pushing for authority over emissions from coal - fired plants			1
and the court 's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry			2
@entity34 earlier this year announced new rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses			1
the @entity87 said ongoing stalemates on @entity89 prompted him to act			0
@entity90 in @entity37 and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing @entity96 reforms , a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization , and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally married same - sex couples for federal purposes			0
the high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal @entity105			0
the justices in 2007 agreed with @entity17 and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses , including carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide emissions , cause air pollution , but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles			1
defining " air pollutant " within the context of greenhouse gases and the ability of the @entity17 to exercise its regulatory authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- was the issue here			1
" today the @entity127 @entity1 delivered a stern rebuke to the president , " said @entity126 attorney general @entity125			0
" it is a resounding defeat for those , like the president , who would use unelected bureaucracies to override the will of the people			0
" @entity126 and 16 other the states in the @entity136 and @entity137 were among the parties whose cases were reviewed by the court			0
a coalition of 15 states backs the @entity87			0
some progressive groups worry the conservative majority @entity1 has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years			0
this is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term			0
the justices earlier this year allowed the @entity17 to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state , and requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions			2
many business groups had hoped the conservative majority would limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas , which the @entity162 and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation .			0

@entity34 administration authority to tighten pollution standards limited
@entity17 can not extend its complete authority on new or expanded power plants
@entity173 had *objected* , saying new rules were a *slippery* slope
but @entity17 does not see ruling as a *negative* , says it *reaffirms* its *policies* mostly
