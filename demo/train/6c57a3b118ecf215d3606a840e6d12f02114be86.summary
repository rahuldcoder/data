-- if you 're part of the nearly 40 percent of @entity3 who are independent or centrist , it 's easy to feel frustrated and politically homeless			1
as activists rally around the most polarizing figures in both parties , we need to play offense from the center and organize across party lines			1
to that end , i 've compiled two lists of centrist candidates -- six @entity16 and five @entity17 -- in competitive elections this fall			1
their success or failure will say a lot about the strength of the center after a season of @entity25 hunting and @entity27 hunting ( that 's " @entity25 " and " @entity28 " ) , and it will indicate the chances of a constructive @entity30 in the year to come			1
you 'll notice that each list reflects candidates running outside their party 's geographic base -- republicans in the @entity40 and @entity39 , @entity17 in the @entity36 and @entity37			1
neither group of candidates can afford to be captive to its party 's special interests , and so it exerts its independence			1
these are the kind of candidates who keep the two - party system flourishing in states that otherwise would revert to one - party rule and reinforce regional red vs. blue stereotypes			1
they are also the kind of candidates our country is going to rely on , after the elections are over and it 's actually time to govern			1
government can not be a warfare of interests , and neither party has a monopoly on good ideas or good people			1
we need to define the common ground that exists and then build on it			1
hyper - partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from uniting to solve the serious challenges we face			1
and here 's an open secret : the centrists in both parties often agree more on issues than they do with extreme members of their own party			1
whether that ultimately results in a third party will be seen down the line , but i know that a centrist coalition will be essential in @entity30 to bridge close divides and to allow common - ground decisions			1
two quick notes : i almost never used the word " moderate , " because it connotes a mushy middle that splits the difference on every issue			1
the word " centrist " better communicates the decisiveness , principle and sense of responsibility that i believe the position can contain			1
second , i 'm an independent rather than a @entity97 or @entity25 , and later in the week , i 'll publish a column looking at some of the independent candidates running this year			1
in the meantime , take in this list of stand - out centrist candidates from both parties and across the country in 2010			1
yes , this self - funded @entity110 nominee for governor has spent an unprecedented amount money to remain competitive as a @entity25 in the @entity113			2
she is in many ways a classic centrist : fiscally conservative but liberal on social issues and committed to the politics of problem solving			2
she 's betting that her ceo experience at the head of @entity122 will help her in tough but inevitable negotiations with public sector unions and restore this great but troubled state to fiscal sanity			2
he should be a @entity110 hero this election cycle : a @entity16 with a more than fighting chance to take president @entity132 's @entity131 seat			2
he 's got fiscal conservative credentials as the first member of the @entity135 to renounce earmarks			2
but he was opposed by @entity138 and other conservative opinion makers in the @entity110 primary largely because he is pro-choice and the co-chairman of the centrist @entity142 in the @entity135			2
nonetheless , he 's running neck - and - neck to win in november , and if he wins , he will be a major player in the constructive center of the @entity131 for decades to come			2
this former @entity148 star is giving former @entity17 gov. @entity149 a run for his money			2
@entity145 ca n't convincingly be painted as a far - right zealot -- he 's pro-choice and pro-environment as well as pushing a pro-business agenda			2
@entity146 has a mail - in only ballot , so the election in this @entity159 jewel is already well under way			2
he established a more than 60 percent approval rating as a @entity25 governor in @entity162 ( his lieutenant governor was @entity166 ) before the @entity17 tidal wave of 2006 swept him out of office			2
now , he 's back in a rematch with the man who beat him , former @entity172 mayor @entity170			0
he 's been a businessman and a congressman , championing some of the toughest anti-crime and innovative environmental initiatives in the country			0
she does n't represent @entity179 's @entity16 , but she 's a return to the @entity110 of @entity181 and @entity182			0
this upstate doctor and small - businesswoman is pro-choice and is running for @entity30 against @entity17 incumbent @entity185			0
it 's a @entity25 - leaning swing district that went narrowly for @entity187 in 2004 and @entity132 in 2008			0
@entity177 's running a few points up against @entity185 , but she 'll have to get past the drag of @entity179 at the top of her ticket			0
the centrist standard - bearer lost his congressional seat in the @entity17 sweep of 2006 , and now he 's aiming for a return			0
he had the guts to push for @entity201 's removal as party leader in 2005 after the scandals involving imprisoned lobbyist @entity204			1
he 's been a charter member of @entity205 , @entity206 and a former director of the @entity208			0
this popular mayor of @entity212 is narrowly leading in polls to take the helm of this center - right state as governor in a three - way race against immigration hardliner @entity218 and @entity110 nominee @entity219			0
@entity209 , an entrepreneur and owner of a local microbrewery , got national attention this year for an ad featuring him taking a shower as a way of washing off all the " mud " from negative campaigns			0
this " @entity230 " @entity97 won @entity232 's vacated congressional seat in 2006 and was re-elected in 2008 despite home - state hero @entity233 running for president			0
she 's pro-choice , pro-gun and pro-energy independence			0
her husband is the only active - duty military spouse in @entity30			0
this old - school budget hawk was one of the leaders of the 1990s budget compromises in @entity30 that brought the country from deficit to surplus under @entity247 and @entity248			0
he 's facing a predictably tough @entity135 race in a red state like @entity240 this year , but the nation is going to need his experience to get out of its fiscal hole , given the likelihood of divided government again			0
he 's been appointed to the bipartisan @entity258 , which is set to release its report in december			0
this centrist senator is facing the longest odds of anyone on this list in her re-election bid against @entity25 congressman @entity267			0
critics say she 's alienated her base			0
@entity270 responds that her fight against the labor unions that pumped $ 1 million into a primary campaign to unseat her because of her opposition to bailouts and the public option shows her independence from party labels in a state that is increasingly conservative			1
the nominee to replace @entity282 in the @entity131 was always a tough fit for @entity210 -- a former investment banker turned superintendent of the @entity212 public school system			0
in this , his first campaign for public office , he 's already fended off a well - financed primary challenge backed by labor unions from a former state legislative leader , who argued that @entity280 had n't been liberal enough in @entity293			0
now he 's locked in a surprisingly tight race against @entity296 favorite @entity295 , who was expected to be comfortably ahead at this stage of the campaign			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity301			1

@entity301 says in polarized political *climate* , centrists offer best shot at actual governing
centrists from both sides of aisle agree more with each other than extremists in own party , he says
he offers 11 candidates who will close partisan divides , find common ground
