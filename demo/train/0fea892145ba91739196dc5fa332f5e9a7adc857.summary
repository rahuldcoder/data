-- march 29 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 : disaster - affected areas @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : an airport 's recovery , a former president 's return to @entity6 , and a plan to block out the sun ! all of it 's on the schedule for today 's show			1
this is @entity0 ! first up : sign of @entity29 @entity30 : we 're starting today in @entity4 at the damaged @entity33 nuclear power plant			1
engineers are trying to figure out just how much the recent earthquake and tsunami damaged the plant 's nuclear reactors , and what that might mean for the area around those reactors			2
yesterday , a government official said one of the reactors might be leaking radioactive material			0
tests on seawater showed some signs of contamination as well , about 360 miles out into the @entity50			2
and tests have shown small amounts of plutonium in the soil at different spots around the power plant , though the company that owns the plant says the plutonium is not a harmful amount			0
parts of @entity4 were shaken by another earthquake , though ; this one hit on monday			1
was n't nearly as strong as the quake from two weeks ago			0
but it did happen in the same general area as the march 11th quake , near the city of @entity67 on @entity4 's east coast			1
that 's where @entity70 is now for us			2
he 's at @entity67 's airport , looking at how its recovery is a sign of hope for the victims of these disasters			1
( begin video ) @entity81 , @entity0 correspondent : if you remember some of the most amazing images that came out in the first hours after the tsunami , one of them would have to be the airport in @entity67			2
it was just so amazing to see this massive airport overrun with water and debris			2
now , we 're going back to see how it looks today			2
but first , we have to avoid @entity4 's ongoing nuclear disaster			1
@entity95 , @entity96 special ops : this is the @entity33 reactor , the 25 - mile restricted area			0
this is our airplane here			0
@entity100 : colonel @entity101 was aboard the first plane to land at @entity67 after the tsunami			0
@entity104 : i think anything that you see on tv , well , @entity105 with their greatest special effects ca n't put into perspective the amount of destruction that was down there on the airfield the day that we arrived			0
@entity100 : sweeping in for landing ourselves , we see none of that			0
you can probably see that , for the most part , behind us it looks great			0
the transition is amazing given what happened here the day of the disaster			0
but get away from the runway and you see the reminders , which a literal army of 240 @entity134 airmen , soldiers and @entity136 , alongside @entity4 civilians , frantically worked to clear			1
by just dumb luck , there were no large passenger planes here when the wave hit , but hundreds of smaller , mostly private aircraft were n't so lucky			0
they look as though they fell from the sky			0
even ones in the hangers were n't spared			0
this is the main entrance here at @entity67			0
it 's like any normal @entity134 airport , only it 's not so normal now			1
@entity67 's an international hub			2
@entity4 officials had written the place off			1
did you think it would be able to be reopened ? @entity159 , @entity160 : to be honest , the answer is no. @entity100 : but it is open			0
it now serves as a center for humanitarian aid distribution			0
and guiding those planes from the same roof on which so many sought shelter , now stand @entity134 @entity96 air traffic controllers , who saw a tragedy and were able to help			1
@entity172 , @entity134 @entity96 combat controller : you feel kind of sad			1
then you know you 're here for a job and hopefully you can bring some relief to the @entity4 people			1
@entity100 : once an iconic image of a disaster , @entity180 has now been transformed into an early sign of hope			2
@entity70 , @entity0 , @entity67 , @entity4			1
( @entity185 ) crisis in @entity187 @entity30 : president @entity188 says the @entity134 role in @entity187 will get smaller as @entity190 takes control of the coalition operation			1
but @entity134 forces will still be involved			1
the question a lot of people are asking is why did the @entity134 get involved in the first place ? democrats and @entity199 have been criticizing the president			1
they 're asking about the purpose of the mission in @entity187 , the cost , and what it might mean for @entity134 's relationship with the @entity209 world			1
president @entity188 was scheduled to give a speech last night to address some of those concerns			2
it happened after we produced this show			0
we 're gon na have more details on that speech for you tomorrow			0
unrest in @entity218 @entity30 : in the @entity220 nation of @entity218 , a law that 's been on the books for nearly 50 years could soon be removed			2
it 's called the " emergency law			2
" what it does is allow the @entity218 government to make preventive arrests , meaning it can arrest people before they commit a crime			0
the decision to lift the law comes after protests against the country 's government			2
dozens of people have been killed in the fighting between protesters and @entity218 security forces			0
a lot of this violence has been happening in a couple cities in @entity218			0
the government blamed the violence in one of those cities , the one you see in these photos , on " armed gangs " who got a hold of police weapons			0
@entity254 @entity255 , @entity15 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an island nation located in the @entity258			0
communist forces took over my government in 1959			0
i 'm less than 100 miles away from the @entity134 , but i 've had a tense relationship with @entity134 for decades			1
i 'm @entity6 , and my capital city is @entity264			1
pres. @entity265 in @entity6 @entity30 : and that 's where former @entity134 president @entity265 is right now			1
he 's in the middle of a three - day visit to the communist nation of @entity6			1
president @entity265 arrived on monday			1
he was invited by @entity6 president @entity272 , whom he 's scheduled to meet with today			1
yesterday , @entity265 met with religious leaders and @entity134 officials			1
it 's not the former @entity134 president 's first trip to @entity6			1
@entity278 looks at what 's on the agenda for former president @entity265 and how this trip will be different from his last visit to the island nation			1
( begin video ) @entity287 , @entity288 , havana : when @entity265 arrived on his last visit to @entity6 , @entity290 himself was on the tarmac to greet the former @entity134 president			1
he 's the only @entity134 leader , in or out of office , to visit the island since @entity272 's 1959 revolution			1
@entity265 will be back on a private mission to talk about ways to improve @entity134 - @entity6 relations with the new president , @entity272			1
in some ways , the time is ripe			0
@entity272 has introduced sweeping changes to the @entity306 - style economy			0
@entity6 freed the last of 75 dissidents jailed in a 2003 crackdown on the opposition that prompted worldwide condemnation			1
@entity312 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for counter-revolutionary activities , but freed this month			0
@entity312 , cuban dissident [ @entity316 ] : " i want to continue my work in the defense of human rights , " he says			0
" we want a democratic and free society			0
" @entity323 : @entity272 agreed to release the prisoners last year as part of a deal brokered by the @entity327 and @entity328 , removing one of the major obstacles to improved relations with the @entity134			1
but you would n't know it from president @entity188 's speech			1
he talked about changes in @entity134 policy toward @entity6 that he 's made , and the need for reciprocal action			1
@entity134 president @entity188 : @entity6 authorities must take some meaningful actions to respect the basic rights of their own people , not because the @entity134 insists upon it , but because the people of @entity6 deserve it			1
@entity323 : part of the reason for the impasse between the nations is @entity350 , a @entity352 contractor who was arrested in @entity264 in 2009			0
this month , @entity350 was sentenced to 15 years in jail for his work on what @entity6 saw as a " subversive " program hooking dissidents up to the internet			1
the @entity134 said he was merely helping the @entity361 community			1
no doubt , expectations will run high that @entity265 will try to secure the early release for @entity350			1
but at least officially , it 's not even on the three - day agenda for the former president			1
( @entity185 ) is this legit ? @entity367 , @entity15 : is this legit ? @entity369 's @entity368 is played every two years			2
nope ! not true ! the @entity368 occurs once every four years			0
@entity370 ? @entity30 : in the summer of 2022 , the @entity372 nation of @entity7 will host the @entity368			0
this is a country where the temperatures in the @entity375 are normally triple digits , so engineers are working on ways for fans and players to beat the heat			1
it 's a robotic cloud made out of carbon fibers			2
officials are planning to put together a prototype this year , and this animation shows you how it might work			0
engines would help the robo - cloud get off the ground			0
and officials would plan to use remote controls to position the cloud between the stadium and the sun. will it work ? engineers have 11 years to find out for sure			2
before we go @entity30 : finally , in a cross-state battle , someone 's about to get their just desserts			2
and it looks like it 's going to be @entity406 , thanks to the world 's biggest whoopie pie			2
this is basically a giant cookie sandwich with fluffy filling in the middle			0
delicious ! @entity406 and @entity413 were jawing over which state could claim it as their dessert			0
@entity413 's largest : more than 200 pounds			2
this one in @entity406 : more than a thousand ! goodbye @entity30 : no matter how you slice it , that victory is sweet			0
i 'm sure it took a while to bake something so big			0
but if you ask the chefs , they 'd probably say it was easy as pie			0
we 've eaten up all our time for today			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity26 .			0
