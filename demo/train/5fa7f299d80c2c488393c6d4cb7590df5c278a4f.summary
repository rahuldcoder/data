-- what do @entity1 and @entity2 have in common ? both were mama 's boys			1
and contrary to popular belief , that 's not a bad thing			0
people tend to think of mama 's boys as coddled and carried and then , later on , too attached for their own good			1
@entity12 's boys are often perceived as weak ; a close relationship between mother and son is viewed as suspect			1
and yet studies support the idea that boys who grow up having tight relationships with their mothers have a certain advantage			2
they become strong , independent leaders			0
just look at the commander in chief			0
@entity25 has gladly admitted : he was a mama 's boy			2
but there 's scientific proof that the close mother - son bond is healthy and beneficial			1
a 2010 study out of the @entity31 , an analysis of more than 69 studies featuring more than 6,000 children , found that kids , especially boys , who have secure attachments to their mothers tended to have fewer behavioral problems throughout their childhoods			2
later on , they were expected to display fewer signs of aggression and hostility			0
they were , it stands to reason , more adaptable , more patient			2
a 2011 study published in the journal @entity47 , meanwhile , found that the quality of the mother - son bond directly related to his sense of morality and his likelihood to have healthy romantic relationships , and that conflict was the biggest predictor of delinquency			1
and in 2012 's " the @entity59 , " author @entity58 used her relationship with her son as a base from which to explore mother - son closeness , ultimately arguing that despite the pressure many mothers feel to let their sons learn to cope largely on their own , keeping them in a closer relationship ultimately helps boys grow into well - adjusted men			1
men who grew up having close relationships with their mothers , she writes , are less inclined to argue and more inclined to " work it out			0
" they have an easier time in adult relationships			0
in my own work , i have encountered many close mother - son relationships , particularly while researching my first book , " @entity78 , " which looked at many single mothers raising boys on their own			1
these mothers were , perhaps not surprisingly , inclined to develop very close bonds with their sons			0
i followed these families for many years and came to understand that mothers , as a whole who refused to buy into the fear of being too close to their sons tended to raise boys who were more responsible , sensitive to the needs of others and more self - assured			2
they were more likely to have a healthy respect for women			0
i learned that mothers who allowed and encouraged boys to show their more emotional side helped their sons develop confidence and empathy			2
there is one place where a tight mother - son bond could come at a disadvantage : once the mama 's boy marries			1
a 2013 study by researchers at the @entity108 found that mothers worry far more when their sons marry than when their daughters marry , and that these worries can turn into a self - fulfilling prophecy , leading to the man feeling jealousy , anger or sadness that , in the worst - case scenario , can destabilize his marriage			0
maybe no one 's surprised that mothers could feel threatened by their daughters - in - law , but it 's still no reason to avoid marrying a mama 's boy			1
a confident mama 's boy , after all , is often well - equipped to navigate tricky social territory			1
but what about mama 's girls ? no one seems to bat an eyelash at the concept of close mother - daughter relationships , at least not while the daughters are small			1
but , in fact , " mama 's girls " may walk a fine line between close and too close			1
a study published in the july issue of @entity139 and behavioral sciences found that relationships between mothers and daughters that could be described as " connected " helped foster better self - esteem than those relationships that could be described as something closer to " interdependent			0
" that is , sharing and caring works ; smothering does not			0
a study out of the @entity151 , for instance , also concluded that too - close relationships -- those in which mothers were hyper - involved and overly critical -- could result in women with poor social skills and disordered attitudes about eating			0
we do know that the mother - daughter relationship tends to work best when the roles remain , for the most part , traditional			1
indeed , mothers of both sons and daughters should worry less about getting caught up in " perception " and what other people think , especially at @entity168			0
if you suspect your son is a mama 's boy , be thankful			2
chances are , he will be , too .			0

@entity174 : people *stigmatize* " mama 's boys , " thinking they *'re* weak
in fact , studies show close relationship to mother can yield many benefits , she says
@entity174 : @entity12 's boys are less aggressive , more adaptable and patient
she says one *downside* is that a close mother - son bond could *disrupt* the son 's marriage
