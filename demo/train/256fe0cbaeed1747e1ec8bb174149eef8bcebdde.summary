what do you get when you combine @entity4 culture , rock and musical theater ? chaos			1
or more precisely @entity7 -- a band of spellbinding musicians presenting vivid visual performances unlike anything you may have ever seen			1
following the devastating tsunami in 2011 , the trio came together with the mission of creating something beautiful out of the turmoil			2
the result is an unusual musical style that blends the vocals and raw acoustic guitar of frontman @entity21 with traditional @entity4 instruments like the three - string tsugaru - shamisen played by a musician known as @entity25			2
the two instrumentalists are accompanied by powerful sword dancing from " @entity28 , " aka @entity29			1
" music gives me imagination or inspiration by just listening to it			0
it 's like i tell a story by using my body , " @entity29 says of dancing with a samurai sword known as a katana			1
" i get an image from the sound by the ( band ) members under the conditions on that day , energy given by the audience , and the atmosphere			0
" @entity29 's energetic sword dancing is a fluid , swift selection of movements that translate the musicians ' deeply personal sound into a visual spectacle for the band 's growing international audience			1
since their conception , the band has played several high - profile gigs outside of @entity4 , including at the venerated annual @entity60 music and media festival in @entity62 , @entity63			1
they 've also completed a tour of the @entity66 as well as performed for fans at festivals in @entity69 and @entity70			0
band leader @entity21 adds : " a strength and characteristic of our band is , we have [ @entity29 ] between us , and through her movement , she expresses the feeling of sadness and delight that we try to express in our play , using her body			0
