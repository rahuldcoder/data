@entity0 -- the @entity2 gave its blessing wednesday to a federal law giving copyright protection to millions of international books , music and other artistic creations that had once been in the free - access " public domain			1
" the 6 - 2 ruling is a setback for a coalition of groups that had sought to keep works by foreign artists easily available in the @entity17 without payment of royalties			1
at issue was whether the @entity25 's " @entity24 " prohibited @entity21 from taking such works out of the public domain			1
a group of artists , film archivists , and educators sued after an international treaty signed by the @entity17 restored copyright protection to thousands of once - royalty - free works originating in other countries			1
the plaintiffs made a free - speech argument , claiming the ruling would create an artistic vacuum , making a large body of songs and films out of their reach , if they had to pay fees			1
justice @entity43 , writing for the majority , downplayed such concerns			0
" neither congressional practice nor our decisions treat the public domain , in any and all cases , as untouchable by copyright legislation , " she said			1
provisions in the law do " not unconstitutionally abridge speech			0
" the plaintiffs were supported by the @entity60 , internet website giants like @entity58 , and library groups			2
the big winners in the dispute are larger media and publishing companies , which hope this high court decision will now lead to greater reciprocal access to foreign markets for @entity17 books , music , films , television and other creative endeavors			2
among the works in question were @entity74 and @entity76 artwork , novels by @entity78 and @entity79 , and music by @entity81 , composer of " @entity82 " -- which is frequently performed in community orchestras			1
one of the original key plaintiffs was @entity17 musician @entity85			0
he had created derivative recordings based on several compositions of the classic @entity89 composer @entity88 , but was later prevented from releasing them			0
" libraries and digital repositories are using new technologies to make our cultural commons more accessible than ever , but they need a robust and stable public domain to be able to do that crucial work , " said @entity91 , an attorney for the @entity92 , which filed a brief supporting @entity85 and others			1
the federal provision " has up - ended a basic tenet of copyright law : once a work enters the public domain , it stays in the public domain			1
" the 1994 law in question was designed to put the @entity17 in compliance with global treaties on intellectual property -- the @entity113 and the so - called @entity114			2
the federal legislation created copyrights to foreign works that had not previously been covered			2
the @entity118 told the high court that millions of works would now receive copyright restoration			0
public domain works can be freely reproduced , performed , downloaded and shared			1
" @entity21 determined that @entity17 interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection , " said @entity43			0
justices @entity128 and @entity130 dissented			0
" the ( federal ) statute has significant @entity133 costs , " wrote @entity128			0
" ... by withdrawing material from the public domain , the statute inhibits an important preexisting flow of information			2
" justice @entity138 did not participate in the case			0
she recused herself after earlier being involved in defending the law while serving as solicitor general in the @entity142 just before joining the high court in 2010			0
the case is @entity145 ( 10 - 545 ) .			0

the ruling means royalties will have to be paid for some foreign works
