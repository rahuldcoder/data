-- on sunday , i will have the honor of serving as grand marshal in the @entity4			1
i have marched in the parade for the last several years carrying a huge rainbow flag			0
last year , i was so elated that i danced my way down the street for the entire route			0
before that , my late wife @entity12 and i , she in her wheelchair , would watch the parade together every year			0
if someone had told me 50 years ago that i would be the marshal of the @entity16 in 2013 at the age of 84 , i never would have believed it			1
over the past couple of years , many people have asked me , " why did you decide to sue the @entity22 over a tax bill ? " because the answer is complex , let me give you some of the background			1
i lived with and loved my late spouse , @entity27 , for more than four decades in love and joy , and in sickness and health , until death did us part			1
when @entity12 died in 2009 from a heart condition two years after we were finally married , i was heartbroken			2
on a deeply personal level , i felt distressed and anguished that in the eyes of my own government , the woman i had loved and cared for and shared my life with was not my legal spouse , but was considered to be a stranger with no relationship to me			1
on a practical level , because of the so - called @entity44 , or @entity44 , i was taxed $ 363,000 in federal estate tax that i would not have had to pay if i had been married to a man named @entity48 instead of a woman named @entity12			1
even if i had just met @entity48 , married him and never even lived with him before he died , the tax would have been zero			1
so , overwhelmed with a sense of injustice and unfairness , i decided to file a lawsuit to get my money back			0
i lucked out when @entity56 , a litigation partner at the law firm of @entity59 , walked into my life			0
at a time when the gay organizations that i approached responded with , " it 's the wrong time for the movement , " @entity56 said -- as did the rev. @entity62 before her -- " there is no wrong time " to seek justice			0
she answered my plea , and took me on			0
@entity56 argued my case in the @entity72 on march 27 this year			1
when she argued against @entity44 , she was cool and calm and informed and reasoned -- all of which was sustained by her deeply felt passion for equality in all of our lives			1
and we won -- all the way			2
i have been so honored and humbled to represent not only the thousands of @entity22 whose lives have been adversely impacted by @entity44 , but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by that same discriminatory law			2
because of the historic @entity72 ruling in my case , the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian @entity22			1
children born today will grow up in a world without @entity44			2
and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married -- as @entity12 and i did -- but with the same federal benefits , protections and dignity as everyone else			2
to all the gay people and their supporters who have cheered me on , thank you			0
i 'm sure that @entity12 is thanking you , too			0
not only does a much larger portion of the " straight " world see us differently -- as just people who live and love and play with their kids -- but also our own community has come out and seen each other , and loved each other , in a way that makes me courageous and proud and joyous every day			0
if i had to survive @entity12 , what a glorious way to do it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity27 .			2

@entity27 won the @entity72 case that *overturned* @entity44
@entity27 never thought she would be grand marshal of @entity4 at 84
she sued over a tax bill and it led to equality for same - *sex* married couples
she was anguished that her government considered her marriage *illegitimate*
