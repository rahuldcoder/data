-- every family , even famous ones , have secrets			2
the @entity4 are no different			0
" we were , sort of , the other @entity7 family that had this horrible curse , " says @entity5			1
she compared her family to the @entity11 -- but the @entity5 curse , she said , is mental illness			1
@entity5 , granddaughter of acclaimed author @entity14 , explores the troubled history of her family in " running from @entity17 , " a documentary that premiered at the @entity19 on sunday			1
@entity20 is the director ; @entity21 is the executive producer			0
" knowing that there 's so much suicide and so much mental illness in my family , i 've always kind of been ' running from crazy , ' worried that one day i 'd wake up and be in the same position , " @entity5 , 51 , said at a support group for families of suicide , as shown in the film			1
@entity5 told @entity0 last week she wanted this documentary to be an unveiling of her family history , and to give people permission to express their own " stuff , " to realize they 're " not alone in the world of dysfunction			1
" the documentary guides the viewer through the turmoil of her parents ' marriage and the troubled relationships between her and her siblings			1
it includes archival footage from when her sister @entity47 , who took her own life in 1996 , had been making a personal family documentary			1
" suicide has no rhyme or reason , " @entity5 said			1
" some people think about it for years and plan it			2
some people , it 's 20 dark minutes of their life that they decide to take their life that comes out of the blue			2
it 's very random , it 's very frightening			2
" whether @entity5 is jumping on a trampoline or submerging herself in a cold stream , with her pointed nose and bouncy blonde hair , her message in the film is one of achieving mental well - being and overcoming one 's own problems			1
these scenes contrast with newspaper clippings , still photos and melancholy video clips from her family 's past			1
seven members of @entity5 's family have died by taking their own lives , including @entity14 and @entity5 's older sister @entity47 , she said			1
@entity5 had denied her sister 's death was a suicide until an event hosted by the @entity85 for the @entity86 in 2003			1
@entity14 , who won the 1954 @entity87 , struggled with depression and killed himself in 1961 , just months before @entity5 was born			1
but suicide was n't something that was talked about when she was growing up			0
" nobody spoke about anything , " she said			0
" it was a different generation			0
" even her sister 's suicide was not talked about , she said			0
@entity97 's home in @entity98 the film 's biggest revelation , which was the most difficult part of her family history for @entity5 to reveal , is that she believes her father , @entity102 , sexually abused her sisters @entity47 and @entity104 , nicknamed " @entity105			1
" @entity5 drops this information bomb only briefly in the film -- the first time she has revealed this publicly			1
@entity5 told @entity0 she does not remember her father abusing her , but notes that she did sleep in the same room as her mother , who had cancer , possibly as protection from her father			1
she is not sure if her mother knew what was going on			0
it 's possible that her father did n't even remember doing it , she says , because he was drunk			0
alcohol abuse also runs in the family , she said			0
@entity5 began her screen acting career as the younger sister of a character played by @entity47 in the 1976 film " @entity126			1
" critics praised @entity5 and dissed @entity47 , which strained their relationship			1
but @entity5 said she had been in touch with her sister the week before she died			1
" she was seemingly ok , " she said			0
" but you never really know with suicide what 's going on in a person 's mind			0
" prior to the film , @entity5 only saw her sister @entity105 about once a year			1
@entity139 lives in @entity140 , @entity141 ; @entity5 lives in @entity142			2
@entity105 had experimented with @entity143 when she was young , and received a diagnosis of manic depression			0
@entity5 has discussed her sister 's struggles in numerous interviews over the years			1
" she represented being , you know , ' crazy , ' " @entity5 said last week			2
" i always feared that i would wake up that way , or that maybe i was that way and i did n't even know it			0
" but since doing the film , they have seen each other a bit more often , including at @entity156			0
making the movie has made @entity5 get over her fear of seeing her sister , whom she describes as " such a loving , kind person			2
" " my dream is to be able to have enough money to take care of her myself , and really take over her care , " she said			0
attempts by @entity0 to contact @entity105 were unsuccessful			0
an april article in the @entity169 , @entity141 , @entity170 said her artwork was being featured in a business in @entity173 , the town adjacent to @entity140			0
business owner @entity175 told the newspaper that @entity105 , 61 , leads a " very happy , very private life			0
" @entity5 , too , said she has had depression and suicidal thoughts , and recalls suffering insecurity and being fearful and depressed growing up			1
when she overcame that , " i was like , ' i 've spent all my life being that way , ' " she said			0
to move past these feelings , @entity5 says she has " done everything " -- psychotherapy , gurus , holistic doctors -- and each of the methods she has tried have given her something of value			2
on her blog , for instance , she recommends that everyone take a few minutes of silence in the morning and before sleeping to be still and silent , which helps her to be more calm and focused			0
practices such as these , in addition to exercise , spending time in nature , and eating right , have all helped her achieve peace , she said			0
it 's only within the last four years that she feels she has completely overcome depression			1
" it 's amazing to me that i 'm not sad anymore , and that i do n't worry and that i do n't fear , " she said			0
these days , @entity5 and her boyfriend @entity205 have a lifestyle company called @entity207 ( " he has the ' will , ' i have the ' way , ' " @entity5 said )			2
health and wellness are her passion			0
she also advocates for suicide and mental illness awareness			0
she is open and communicative with her two daughters about their own mental health , too			0
" i think people need to talk about it a lot , " she said of mental illness , " making it ok that it 's in your family			2
" she added , " it does n't shame anyone , and it does n't make anybody 's family an ugly , bad family			2
" that is a challenge to which this @entity19 film also rises			2
