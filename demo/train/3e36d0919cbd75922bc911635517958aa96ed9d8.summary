@entity7 died of cancer in 2009 and left her artwork to her alma mater			1
the university is suing @entity2 for the portrait , which hangs in the bedroom of his @entity16 beach house			1
" i talk to it			0
" @entity2 said , his voice choking with emotion			1
" it 's her presence in my life and her son 's life			0
it would seem a crime to lose it			0
" he said he would never consider selling the portrait , which has been valued in court at between $ 1 million and $ 12 million , depending on whose expert is talking			0
but @entity2 insists it 's not about the money			2
" i plan to keep it in our family as long as there 's a family , " @entity2 told a rapt jury of six men and six women			1
@entity2 's second turn on the witness stand came during the third week of a trial that has focused on art and legacy and the sometimes stormy relationship of a @entity51 golden couple torn apart by infidelity but reunited by their battles with cancer			1
that disputed @entity6 : a portrait of the final days of @entity7 a little art history the @entity60 - nominated actor previously testified that the portrait , a 40 - inch by 40 - inch silkscreen on canvas , was given to him by @entity6 in 1980			1
a nearly identical portrait , which he said was given to @entity7 at the same time , was bequeathed to the university and hangs in its @entity67 @entity2 testified that he had been friends with @entity6 since the late 1960s ; they met when the artist painted his ex-wife @entity70 -- or rather , he painted a butterfly on her leg			1
@entity2 introduced the artist to @entity7 in 1980 , shortly after @entity2 began seeing her			1
he said the deal for the two paintings was hatched at a @entity6 book - signing party in @entity78			1
@entity2 described how @entity6 painted hearts on a tablecloth at the @entity78 party			1
" it was a series of hearts coming together , and he could see @entity7 and i were falling in love and he wanted to express how he felt about us coming together			2
" the tablecloth , signed by @entity6 , includes the artist 's @entity88 phone number , the dedication " to @entity91 and @entity92 ' " and " @entity78 " in a semicircle			1
the university has the tablecloth and a napkin drawing of @entity7 's eye			2
@entity2 has another napkin drawing of his lips , and he 's countersued the university for the tablecloth			2
he testified that he did not object when the trustee for @entity7 's estate signed it over to the university but that he considers the tablecloth his property as well			2
" we both ate off it , " he said			0
he now wishes he 'd spoken up about keeping it after @entity7 died			2
' they 're heirlooms ' " i was in a state of shock for some weeks prior to losing her and months afterward , " he said			0
" it 's for her son			0
this is not art , sorry			0
" after the @entity78 party , @entity2 said he received a call from @entity6 , who said he was ready to paint @entity7 and asked if they minded if the television news magazine show " 20/20 " filmed the sitting			1
the show was working on a piece about @entity6 at the time			2
" he said she could keep the portrait he would paint of her and i could keep mine , " @entity2 testified			1
he said he and his daughter @entity130 , then 16 , attended the session at @entity6 's @entity88 studio , called @entity133 , and described the scene in detail			2
" there was no easel , no paint			0
there was just this strange dentist 's @entity141 camera			0
he just snapped her at different turns , maybe 25 shots			0
" the session was taped by " 20/20 , " and a producer for the show testified earlier that she did not see @entity2 there			2
the actor told the court he was keeping a low profile because @entity7 was getting a divorce from actor @entity154 and did n't want to be photographed or seen publicly with other men			1
" are you certain you were there ? " defense attorney @entity157 asked			0
" as @entity160 is my witness , " @entity2 replied			2
" are you certain @entity130 was with you ? " " as @entity160 is my witness			0
" about two weeks later , @entity2 said , he received a call and he and @entity7 picked up the portraits			1
he saw portraits of famous people stacked one on top of the other at the factory -- @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , " and some people i did n't recognize			2
" he was handed one portrait , and @entity7 was handed the other , he said			1
afterward , " we went down to the streets of @entity88 to find a cab where these two paintings would fit			0
" over the years , the couple repeated the story to friends many times over dinner			2
he said @entity7 never disputed his version of events			2
he also described several other dinners the couple had with @entity6			1
during those dinners , the artist -- who was fascinated by celebrities -- would whip out a tape recorder , as well as a marker or paint brush , and decorate the napkins and tablecloths			0
@entity2 said he and @entity7 would always agree to be recorded as long as they could leave with a signed keepsake			1
@entity2 : @entity6 portrait of @entity7 ' is mine ' backing up @entity2 's story @entity2 's story was backed by other members of @entity7 's inner circle who testified for the defense this week			1
they include two close friends : @entity205 , the former wife of actor @entity207 and rocker @entity208 ; and @entity209 , who left her job as news anchor @entity212 's hairstylist to help care for @entity7 after she was stricken with cancer			1
the women , and @entity2 , were at @entity7 's side when she died on june 25 , 2009			1
the defense witnesses gave jurors a vastly different version of events than that painted by witnesses called by the university , which claims @entity7 loved her days as a student at its art school and left both portraits to her alma mater			1
the university 's witnesses include @entity7 's college boyfriend , a reality show producer and a former personal assistant			2

he also acknowledged he had been involved in a flurry of lawsuits against @entity2 and had filed criminal complaints against @entity2 , @entity208 and the trustee of @entity7 's estate			1
@entity254 , the trustee , had been the couple 's business manager for many years			2

' their love dates for 30 - odd years ' " @entity2 said one of them was his , and i trusted @entity2 , " @entity254 testified			1

they were practically a married couple			0
" their love dates for 30 - odd years			1
i was never going to question what @entity2 was doing			2

' and she said ' thank you			0
' then she said , ' that painting is @entity2 's			2
let me tell you the story			0
' and then she say , ' a friend of mine , you know , his name is @entity6 , painted that for @entity2 and he did one for me , too			1
' " @entity209 the hairstylist said @entity7 told her she owned one @entity6 portrait and @entity2 owned the other			1
" she told me that @entity6 had contacted @entity2 , and @entity2 had asked her to pose for a portrait for mr. @entity6 and she did , and he gave one to her and one to him			1
" another friend , @entity303 , said he heard the same story from both @entity7 and @entity2			1
he said he was too polite to interrupt @entity2 , who went " on and on and on " as he told it			0
" she told me that she owned one and @entity2 owned one			0
@entity2 told me that he owned his and she owned hers			0
i think @entity7 is very smart in her business life , and she agreed to do this so she 'd get a portrait and @entity2 would get one , " @entity303 said			1
@entity205 also said she heard the story over dinner			0
" @entity6 had called him when they first started going together			0
he wanted to paint @entity7			0
( @entity2 ) said , ' you have to do one for each of us			0
' they went to @entity133 , walked down @entity321 carrying the paintings , laughing and trying to get a cab big enough to carry the paintings			0
" @entity208 said @entity2 would take the lead telling the story and @entity7 would chime in			1
@entity303 and @entity208 also testified that there was no estrangement between the couple at the end			0
