-- @entity1 submitted her resignation as a @entity4 representative from @entity5 before @entity6 on wednesday , and an initial reaction might be a sense of despair about her decision to step aside			1
many have imposed a narrative of national recovery on @entity1 ' ability to run for her office again and take her oath in a clear strong voice			1
but in this case , it would be a mistake to confuse holding public office with redemption			1
a congressional seat is not supposed to be a plot point for @entity26 endings , and by passing up the chance to run again , @entity1 has demonstrated a respect for the principles of representative democracy			1
the authors of the @entity32 intended @entity6 to be a rotating body , free from the cults of personality and lifetime sinecures that characterized @entity38 governance			1
although it is human nature to see a kind of triumph in being able to come back to one 's job after an injury , @entity1 understands that the office belonged not to her but to southern @entity5			1
she made the decision after a year of rehabilitation , and she deserved that time to make a hard call with the best evidence			2
her choice this week recalls an old observation of @entity53 , who said he always tried to remember that the crowds cheering and the bands playing " @entity56 " were not for him personally			2
they were for the office of the presidency			2
the office of @entity6 may also be too small for @entity1			1
this is a body that commands the respect of 8 % of the electorate : a record low			2
and despite the illusion of glamour that surrounds it , the actual work can be physically taxing and spiritually dreary			0
traveling back and forth from @entity70 each week , visiting the @entity72 floor multiple times a day for procedural votes , sweet - talking big donors , finding positions that will please the district without making you feel like a sellout -- all of these can take their toll			0
after her bruising re-election fight of 2010 -- one of the nastiest races in recent local memory , with an eerie pallor of violence hanging over it -- @entity1 herself doubted whether she wanted the job much longer			1
she now has a golden opportunity to start a " @entity98 " for the study of gun violence or mental health care reform or solar energy or whatever public policy issue she wants to emphasize			2
her moral authority and influence may be better used outside the halls of @entity6 , where she would have been inevitably fettered by the daily grind of politics and partisanship			1
in her video announcement , she said : " i will return , and we will work together for @entity5 and this great country			0
" and we should take her at her word , even if that does n't mean a return to elective office			0
to be sure , this is not the future anyone would have wanted			0
there is enormous cruelty in her injury -- the robbery of her ability to speak -- which was one of her truly exceptional qualities			2
i remember thinking near the end of her first campaign for @entity6 , in 2006 , that the only thing that could deny her a victory over her maladroit opponent would be some kind of epic goof made during a campaign rally or a debate -- a vague exclamation taken out of context or a damaging statement made in passion			1
but such a possibility was remote			0
" @entity1 does n't really make mistakes , " i told a friend			1
she possessed a preternaturally strong sense of control over her words			0
this was also true in private conversation			0
@entity1 had that quality , cherished among leaders , to gauge the emotional temperature of the person she was with and adjust her own bearing accordingly			1
there were many times in our friendship when she managed to say the unexpectedly perfect thing in the moment : a key piece of advice , a joke , an anecdote that had precise relevance			0
there is a picture of her that is difficult for me to view			0
it is the last photograph of her taken before the 16 seconds of gunfire that would change everything			0
she is standing in front of the @entity168 on january 8 , 2011 , looking intently at a middle - aged woman named @entity170 , who had been next in line to speak with her in back of her is the plate - glass front of the grocery store on which the smeary reflections of a few people are visible			0
out of this crowd a gunman was about to emerge			0
but what dominates the frame is @entity1 ' expression , one of wordless concentration and interest in what @entity185 was saying			1
it was a look that i knew well			0
the loss of her ability to find the words in conversation easily is an awful blow			2
but the @entity1 i know wo n't surrender the primary motivating force in her life , which is the urge to make a difference in the public sphere and to use her talents to make life better for those around her			1
that was what motivated her first run for @entity6 five years ago			1
she is leaving national elective office in the same way she came in : with class and dignity			2
it would be a mistake to think of this as a defeat because it is not the neat @entity26 ending we had hoped for			0
and this is not an ending			0
join the conversation on @entity220			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : we have put a narrative of national recovery on @entity1 ' ability to run again
by stepping down , @entity1 shows a respect for principles of democracy , he says
her moral authority and influence may be better used outside @entity6 , @entity223 says
@entity223 : her driving motivation is to make a positive difference in public life , and she will
