the club is awaiting a decision , due next month , on its appeal against this ban to the global @entity140			0
@entity2 was reported to have splashed out $ 80 million in 2012 assembling a squad containing big names like @entity6 's double @entity113 champion @entity143 and @entity145 defender @entity144 , but the many top players left as the club cut its costs .			0
