-- the head of the @entity2 warned the world this week of a new virus , awkwardly dubbed @entity5 , found in @entity6			1
" looking at the overall global situation , my greatest concern right now is the novel coronavirus , " @entity10 said , calling it " a threat to the entire world			1
" " we understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat , " the director general said in her closing speech to the 66th session of the @entity16			0
" any new disease that is emerging faster than our understanding is never under control			0
" these are alarm bells and we must respond			0
the novel coronavirus is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself			0
" with just 49 cases of the new disease reported since june 2012 , it may seem puzzling that @entity33 named the @entity35 coronavirus -- @entity5 or @entity35 for short -- the greatest threat to world health today			1
your questions about @entity35 , answered but @entity40 - born @entity33 can be forgiven a strong reaction			2
after all , she managed the response to @entity44 there in 2003 , and @entity35 is a close genetic cousin			1
at least 8,000 people in 30 countries contracted @entity44 in 2003 ; 774 died of the disease			2
no doubt her sense of urgency also stems from the apparently high mortality rate : to date , 27 of the 49 people who have caught the disease have perished , or 52 %			1
although the majority of illnesses have been in the @entity6 , cases have emerged in seven countries			1
similarities between the @entity44 and @entity35 viruses are more than genetic			1
both cause acute respiratory distress syndrome , or @entity61 , and trigger reactions in the human immune system that are so severe , organs throughout the body are devastated -- collateral damage in an overly vigorous battle with the microbes			0
both viruses spread between people through close contact , putting family caregivers and health care workers at risk for infection			0
in april , for example , according to a report in the @entity78 medical journal @entity79 , a @entity81 man who had traveled to @entity82 fell ill with the disease in @entity81 , although it was n't diagnosed immediately			0
another patient who shared the first man 's hospital room caught the disease			0
the first man died on may 28 ; the second remains in intensive care			0
5 things to know about @entity35 a new report in the @entity95 offers a glimpse of the depth of mystery shrouding @entity35			2
a team of @entity6 @entity101 researchers describe a november outbreak in a @entity104 urban household of 28 extended family members , four of whom -- all men -- contracted mers			2
the cluster of cases in this family presents a list of mysteries : why were all the sick and dead men ? with 28 people in this three - building urban household , why were these four infected , and the other 24 spared ? the family lived in a big city , had no animals , ate supermarket food and had jobs that offered no contact with the virus			2
how did they catch @entity35 ? until researchers can determine what animal is the natural host of the virus , and how @entity35 spreads from the host to humans , each new outbreak is dangerous and mysterious			2
the science is still unfolding			0
meanwhile , the @entity2 and world health community watch , anxiously , recalling how swiftly the @entity44 outbreak that started in southern @entity135 in december 2002 exploded a month later across @entity136 , @entity137 , and on , eventually hitting 30 countries			1
sadly , resources for confronting such outbreaks have decreased since the 2008 financial crisis , and @entity35 has emerged in one of the most difficult regions in the world			1
were the virus to reach any of the refugee camps that house more than 2 million @entity148 refugees , a genuine pandemic could ensue			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

the head of @entity2 said @entity5 virus found in @entity6 threatens " the entire world "
@entity152 : it 's alarming that of 49 cases , 27 -- that 's 52 % -- have died
@entity163 : the virus related to @entity44 , and scientists worry it could spread as fast
@entity35 emerged in a difficult region , she says , and threatens @entity148 refugees
