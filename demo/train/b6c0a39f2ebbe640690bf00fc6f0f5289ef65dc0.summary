-- archaeologists are reveling in the discovery of an ancient synagogue in northern @entity4 , a " monumental " structure with a mosaic floor depicting the biblical figure of @entity8 and a @entity10 inscription			1
the synagogue -- dating to the fourth and fifth centuries in both the @entity16 and late @entity15 periods -- is in @entity17 , an ancient @entity18 village in the country 's @entity20 region , the @entity11 said			1
@entity22 , a professor of early @entity23 in the @entity24 at the @entity25 at @entity26 , said the building was found in a recent excavation			0
she called the find " exciting " and described the " very high quality of the artwork " in the mosaic , crafted with " tiny colored stone cubes			0
" only a few late @entity15 period synagogues contained mosaics with biblical scenes , said @entity22 , one of the leaders of a @entity38 , @entity4 and @entity40 team engaged in the digs			2
" this discovery is significant , " she said , calling the site " extraordinary " and " stunning			0
" @entity8 was known for enormous physical strength and his fighting prowess against the @entity46 , the enemy of the @entity48			2
his story , recounted in the @entity51 's @entity50 , mentions @entity52 , a @entity46 woman who worked to undermine @entity8			1
she cut his hair after she persuaded @entity8 to reveal that his long hair was the secret to this strength			2
@entity22 said the mosaic scene shows @entity8 putting torches between the tails of foxes			1
that image , from a vignette in the @entity50 , is a reference to @entity8 exacting revenge on the @entity46 by sending out flame - laden foxes to burn their lands			1
she said the only other images of @entity8 in synagogues are at one nearby place in the @entity20 known as @entity70 , where @entity8 is seen " smiting " the @entity46 with the jawbone of an ass			1
another is in what is now modern @entity76 , depicting scenes from @entity8 's life			2
@entity8 is also depicted in early @entity80 art , she said			0
why is @entity8 portrayed and apparently revered in two synagogues close to each other ? @entity22 said she plans to find out			0
the other image contains two apparently female faces flanking a circular medallion			0
it has a @entity10 inscription referring to rewards for carrying out good deeds			1
" our mosaics are also important because of their high artistic quality and the tiny size of the mosaic cubes			0
this , together with the monumental size of the stones used to construct the synagogue 's walls , suggest a high level of prosperity in this village , as the building clearly was very costly , " the authority said in its statement , citing @entity22 .			0
