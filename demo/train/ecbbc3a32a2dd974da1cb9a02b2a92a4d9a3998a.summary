-- @entity1 is a fighter			1
he 's also a philosopher			2
" everyone has their own destiny , " he says			2
the football star 's fate is now firmly in his own hands -- something he thanks @entity9 for each and every day			1
his faith , and fighting spirit , has helped him climb out of an abyss -- not once , but twice -- recover his strength and stand proudly tall once more			2
but the future did not seem so certain in march 2011			2
the @entity17 , then at @entity16 , was diagnosed with a cancerous liver tumor following a routine examination			1
it was a moment that would not only change his life , but would transform him as a person			2
" it was a shock , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity25			2
" but it was a quick shock because mentally i am very strong			2
" i am a fighter			2
i had a clear and honest discussion with the doctors and the surgeons			0
i told them that if i had something bad in my body that it was better for them to take it out quickly			0
" it was complicated to come back , but like i always say , sport enabled me to have this mental strength to fight			0
" it was certainly because of that that i managed to be even stronger in that battle			0
" @entity1 's fight with cancer shocked the world of football			1
the defender , a much - loved character within @entity48 after playing a key role in his team 's success , received support from across the sporting world			2
even the players and president of @entity56 , @entity16 's fiercest rival , showed public support for @entity1 while he was laid up in a hospital bed following the operation , which took place just days after the tumor had been found			1
teams wore t - shirts urging @entity1 a quick recovery , @entity62 and @entity63 were awash with good wishes and television pictures showed @entity16 fans singing his name in the 22nd minute of each half -- the shirt number which he wore with such distinction			1
the widespread support proved invaluable to @entity1			1
" i remember everything , " he says			0
" when you are in hospital you ca n't really see what 's going on outside			0
" all of that certainly helped me and proved that i was cherished and liked in @entity82 and in the @entity16 team			1
" it motivated me to tell people that , ' although i am ill , i wo n't let myself go down			0
i will do everything to come back and try to finish the season with the club			2
' " most survivors would be happy to just be in a position to have their health -- but for @entity1 that was simply not enough			1
a warrior , he was determined to fight back all the way -- not just to peak health but to a place where he could once again pull on the famous blue and red stripes of @entity16			1
" i always had fighting spirit , " he says			0
" yes i had the illness but i still had a chance of playing sport at a high level			0
there are similarities between illness and sport -- you ca n't get beaten			0
" i told myself that even though i was ill that i would n't allow myself to get beaten			0
i said , ' i am going to fight for myself , for my wife and children , my parents and all the people who surround me			0
' " @entity1 surprised everyone by returning to training within weeks of his diagnosis , hoping to make an incredible comeback before the end of the 2010 - 11 season			1
such was @entity1 's willpower that he did indeed return to the @entity16 side -- making a substitute appearance against @entity56 on may 3			1
just 25 days later he played the full 90 minutes at @entity121 as @entity16 defeated @entity122 3 - 1 , and @entity1 was afforded the honor of lifting the @entity125 trophy -- a gesture which he will never forget			1
" it was a special moment , " he recalls			0
" there are not many of us who can win the @entity125 , let alone be given the special gesture of lifting the trophy			0
" it was a gesture from the whole team			0
the club and players lived through the difficult moments with me			2
" it was an utter privilege and an honor			0
i will always thank my teammates for that gesture			0
" less than a year later , however , @entity1 was once again fighting the cancer -- in march 2012 it was revealed he needed a liver transplant due to problems the initial operation did not resolve			1
teammate and close @entity146 offered part of his , but it was not possible due to the impact it would have on his own playing career , so @entity1 instead turned to his cousin @entity153			1
@entity1 again made a heroic comeback , returning to action a year later on april 6 , 2013 as @entity16 went on to regain the @entity156 from @entity56			1
however , any thoughts of extending his six - year stay at the @entity159 were soon extinguished once the club revealed it would not be offering him a new contract			2
but the no. 22 shirt is still linked with @entity1 , as @entity146 has taken it on			1
" with @entity146 it 's unique because my wife gets along very well with his wife , we lived next to each other , i liked his mindset and vice versa , " @entity1 says of the @entity163			1
" we had a good feeling , we have a similar personality			0
everyone knows about the gesture he did for me when i was ill. he remains an important person in my life			0
" after winning 15 trophies in his time with @entity16 , @entity1 returned to where it all began for him as a professional -- @entity183			1
he began his professional career in the @entity185 , before going on to play for @entity186 and hometown club @entity187 , where he won the @entity17 title in each of his three seasons before joining @entity16 for $ 16 million in 2007			1
his form this season looks likely to secure him a place in @entity196 's @entity195 squad in @entity163 next year -- not bad for a man who almost lost his life			1
" the move back to @entity183 gave me the chance to close a full circle , " he said			1
" it was important for me			0
it was n't an easy choice but it was important because i started here and i wanted my kids where their dad started back in the day			0
" i have pictures to show them of me when i was a little younger and things were a bit different			0
it 's a club which gave me a lot -- a club which gave me a start as a professional and i wanted to give them something back			1
" the phrase " giving back " is one which @entity1 likes to use over and over again whether it be in relation to his family or those in society who are less privileged			1
a devout muslim who prays five times a day , @entity1 believes he has a responsibility to work with the current generation of youngsters and help guide them through turbulent times			2
a leader , he likes to show by example both on and off the field -- but to the last he remains a warrior and a philosopher			0
" it 's important for me whatever the situation to know that we are not here by accident , " he said			0
" we certainly all have a mission on earth , mine is to help people			0
" the illness i went through was n't by accident			0
the way i see it is that @entity9 gives you challenges			1
