members of the @entity5 came out in record numbers to vote friday night at the organization 's annual conference , held this year in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" @entity3 " won a runoff vote by a whopping majority , earning more votes than " @entity14 " ( an acronym for " @entity16 , " describing anxiety over being inundated by the information on social media ) and " the 99 % , " ( those held to be at a financial or political disadvantage to the top moneymakers , the one - percenters )			0
occupy joins previous year 's winners , " app , " " tweet , " and " bailout			2
" " it 's a very old word , but over the course of just a few months it took on another life and moved in new and unexpected directions , thanks to a national and global movement , " @entity28 , chair of the @entity29 for the @entity5 , said in a statement			1
the @entity39 movement began in september in @entity40 , before spreading to communities around the country and the world as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth and other issues			0
founded in 1889 , the @entity5 is made up of " academics , linguists , anyone involved in the specialization of language , " according to @entity53 , the society 's vice president			1
@entity53 , who also co-hosts " @entity57 , " a public radio program about language , said the annual conference provides an opportunity for linguistics professionals and graduate students to share information and research			1

@entity53 said many of the nominated words that have significance now likely wo n't stand the test of time			0
for instance , " @entity94 " and " 9 - 9 - 9 " were quite popular in 2011 , but @entity53 doubts they 'll last very long			0
some words are just outright unnecessary -- like @entity97 's " bi-winning , " a term he used to describe himself pridefully , dismissing accusations of being bipolar , and " amazeballs , " a slang form of amazing			2
in the most outrageous category , " deather " -- one who doubts the official story of the killing of @entity108 -- was recognized			0
