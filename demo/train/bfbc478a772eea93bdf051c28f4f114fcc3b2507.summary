-- @entity3 's @entity2 is clinging to power despite a wave of opposition due in part to a legacy of decentralized authority and divided tribal politics that has been reinforced during the embattled strongman 's four - decade rule , analysts told @entity0 tuesday			1
@entity2 's grip on power nevertheless appears to be weakening , a fact illustrated by the recent defections of a number of prominent @entity3 diplomatic officials			1
@entity3 's ambassador to the @entity20 and deputy ambassador to the @entity22 are among those now pushing for @entity2 to step aside			1
in eastern @entity3 , groups of armed people in civilian clothing have been guarding the streets and appear to be in firm control			2
two @entity3 fighter pilots defected to @entity30 with their jets on monday rather than follow orders to bomb their fellow citizens			2
but @entity2 has been able to carry through on a brutal crackdown resulting in the apparent deaths of hundreds of @entity3			1
he pledged tuesday to die " a martyr " before voluntarily relinquishing power			0
opposition to @entity2 is hampered by the fact that @entity3 's sense of national identity is " very weak , " said @entity42 , a senior fellow at the @entity43			1
tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated @entity46 country comes first -- a fact which makes it extremely tough for @entity2 's opponents to present a unified front			1
for years , @entity2 has effectively played different tribes against each another while using @entity3 oil wealth to generate patronage and buy off potential opponents , @entity42 said			1
a resulting decentralized power structure beneath the very top levels of the @entity3 government has made it easier for the longtime leader to survive in the face of a growing push for change			1
to the extent that @entity2 has empowered others in his regime , he has placed his trust in a few key members of his own ethnic group , according to @entity69 , head of the @entity71 program at the @entity72			2
using tools of co-option and coercion , he effectively shifted power away from the city of @entity78 and the eastern portion of the country -- traditional bases of opposition to his rule			1
recently , @entity2 further bolstered his power by bringing in mercenaries from neighboring countries such as @entity87 and @entity88			2
@entity3 's armed forces remain relatively weak by design , @entity42 noted			0
@entity2 has worked over the years to prevent the creation of a military that could become unified in opposition to him , a development that contributed to the overthrow of the @entity97 and @entity98 governments			1
" this has been an absolute rule , " @entity42 told @entity0			0
" there have been no countervailing institutions			0
" @entity97 , in contrast to @entity3 , had at least " some organized political opposition , some @entity105 , and some freedom of association , " traditions which proved critical in the overthrow of president @entity109			2
@entity2 , much like his counterparts in @entity112 , has also not hesitated to use brutal force when necessary			0
he has shown " no reservations about bombing people into submission , " @entity69 noted			0
adding to the hurdles faced by would - be reformers : @entity120 's lack of a strong tradition of vibrant intellectual discourse and dissent			0
" he 's been very successful in tamping down any potential opposition from an intellectual class , " @entity69 said			0
and while @entity3 has a wealthy business community , " there 's fear to speak out on the issues , " she added			0
can @entity2 survive the winds of change ? if he falls , @entity69 asserted , it will likely be due to opposition from the military 's middle ranks -- an officer corps that has been subjected to repeated purges in the past			1
while the purges have helped @entity2 maintain his hold on power over the years , they have n't made him very popular , she noted			2
to the extent that the outside world can influence events in @entity3 , there will be a continued push for rapid change , @entity42 argued			2
western @entity150 countries such as @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are extremely dependent on @entity3 oil and can not tolerate instability there			1
" if @entity3 descends into civil war with major disruptions in the oil market , this could really hit @entity150 in its pocketbook , " he said			1
" we 're in uncharted waters now , " @entity42 noted			0
" it seems that the regime is rotting from within			0
... it 's hard to see how he puts the genie back in the bottle			0
if he does , it 'll require such enormous brutality that @entity3 will become a true international pariah			0
" @entity0 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 has clung to power partly by creating *obstacles* to a unified opposition
@entity3 is dominated by tribal politics -- a tradition that hampers opponents
@entity2 has repeatedly purged the military , the institution most likely to bring about change
@entity150 is very dependent on @entity3 oil , not prepared to deal with extended instability there
