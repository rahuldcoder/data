-- it 's becoming a clich√© : the tide is turning in the debate over cannabis			1
@entity6 , @entity0 's chief medical correspondent , publicly reversed his position and now supports medical cannabis			1
@entity9 gov. @entity9 just expanded @entity11 's medicinal marijuana laws			1
in the past month , @entity12 and @entity13 have become the 19th and 20th states to approve medical marijuana			1
but the debate over medical marijuana obscures the more fundamental issue of our failed war on pot and the path to smart legalization			1
i had an opportunity to explore the full range of perspectives in the marijuana debate at the recent 2013 @entity29 of the @entity30			1
what i learned can be simply stated : @entity33 cannabis legalization is coming and smart regulation is the key to its success			2
at the convention , held in @entity38 , i listened to and spoke with respected leaders of the opposition to cannabis legalization , who are mostly specialized in the treatment of substance use disorders			2
the @entity43 is a proving ground for @entity46 's liberal medical marijuana laws			1
@entity47 , policy manager for the @entity46 branch of the pro-legalization @entity49 , took me on a tour of local cannabis dispensaries			0
and @entity52 invited me to speak at their makeshift headquarters -- their previous location was closed after a @entity56 raid last year -- where classes are offered on all things cannabis			0
the dispensaries are largely self - regulated , yet all facilities are immaculate , security is tight , and members of the staff are knowledgeable about the science of cannabis			0
surely not all points of access are as well - run as these dispensaries , but they could be			0
and only with legalization and regulation can we expect that they would be			2
most legalization advocates and opponents share concerns about underage pot use , an opposition to incarcerating users , and a recognition that marijuana is less harmful to adults than alcohol			1
opinion : @entity84 agree , pot is no crime most agree public opinion has shifted in favor of cannabis legalization , although the two groups have strongly divergent feelings about the change			1
a minority of advocates call for @entity84 to " free the weed " with few restrictions , while opponents at the @entity30 fear that legalization would lead to " a nation of drunken stoners " after an anticipated rise in adolescent use of this and other drugs			1
the substance abuse treatment community has legitimate concerns , and recreational cannabis should not be legalized -- for minors			1
if national polls are correct , and wisdom prevails , then @entity84 is rapidly moving toward legal cannabis for adults			2
we must stop arguing about the right of consenting adults to consume a relatively safe recreational drug , and discuss how -- rather than whether -- cannabis should be properly regulated by the federal government			1
first , consider the four essential goals of marijuana regulation : keeping cannabis out of the hands of minors ; reducing harm to adult users ; preventing collateral harm to the public and getting the maximum economic benefit from legalization			1
our approach to federal regulation should synthesize the perspectives of both advocates and opponents of legalization			2
we should look to research on laws controlling alcohol , tobacco and gambling			0
we can also learn from @entity140 and @entity141 , which have developed regulations for recreational cannabis , and the 18 other states -- plus the @entity144 -- that have legalized medical marijuana			1
we can achieve the essential goals of regulation if we : require proper labeling of cannabis products , including the quantities of key ingredients like @entity152 and @entity153			2
test cannabis products for contaminants and label accuracy			0
require government supervision of all facilities involved in the production , distribution and sale of cannabis			0
limit advertising , sales and public consumption of cannabis products the way we do with alcohol and / or tobacco			0
@entity172 cannabis packaging and advertising that targets or attracts underage users			0
require child - resistant packaging for edible cannabis products			0
impose penalties on adults who enable minors to get marijuana			1
allow adults to grow a small number of cannabis plants for personal use			0
prosecute cannabis - impaired driving with field sobriety tests			0
continue restrictions on cannabis use by professionals and laborers when scientific evidence indicates that such use risks public safety			0
empower states and municipalities to restrict the cannabis trade within their borders			0
fund education of adults about the use and abuse of cannabis			0
fund preventive youth education about the dangers of underage cannabis use			0
fund treatment of adults and minors with cannabis use disorders			2
tax all aspects of the cannabis trade at the highest rate that the free market will bear , using a portion of the proceeds to fund regulation , education and treatment			0
just as responsible fishermen support the conservation of marine ecosystems , even marijuana enthusiasts can offer smart ideas for the successful legalization of cannabis , the fiercest critics of pot legalization have legitimate concerns , particularly about pot 's effects on developing brains of young people			1
advocates and opponents need to come together for an open - minded discussion about the regulation of marijuana in the @entity84			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			2

@entity242 : medical marijuana debate obscures the issue of legalizing recreational use
in legalizing pot , he says , concerns of both sides of the issue need to be considered
@entity242 : goals are to keep it out of the hands of minors , reduce harm to adults , get revenue
@entity242 : opponents and supporters of legalization must listen to each other 's concerns
