, or wants to keep their grocery bill from skyrocketing needs to be aware of a new dynamic in the world economy			1
it 's called the " @entity25 " and it is about how modern shocks to systems in far corners of the world are now having a direct impact on local employment and economies , including the parts that go into cell phones , the financial markets that house our retirement savings and the global agriculture system			1
we saw the downside of single - source supply contracting and just - in - time inventory systems when a manufacturing plant for a certain type of gasket was destroyed in the 2011 @entity34 tsunami			1
it led to the shutdown of production facilities in the big six automakers in the @entity39 , which weakened the economy and contributed to the @entity39 unemployment rate increasing from 8.9 % to 9.1 % during this time			1
if carmakers had a @entity43 for gasket supply , an economic disruption that put factory employees out of work could have been avoided			2
advancements in supply chain technology have improved efficiency and lowered the prices we pay for goods and services			2
but without a mindset that recognizes that we are in a @entity43 world , we are less resilient to the acute shocks and chronic stresses our world faces every day			1
the @entity43 mindset will allow us to use our creativity to proactively plan for more resilient solutions			2
by that i mean developing ways that people , communities , industries and even nations are better able to rebound in the face of adversity and come back even stronger			2
what makes this important ? the speed of change -- along with the increasing environmental , economic , social and political volatility -- has led to crises of intensifying frequency , scale and severity , with potentially catastrophic effects that cascade across sectors and geographies			1
a reality of our time is that we can not anticipate every catastrophe or stressful event			2
we can -- and must -- do what we can to prevent bad things from happening , but the fact remains that surprises will still happen			1
ominous recent episodes demand we always have a @entity43 that minimizes the lasting effects of a range of future threats and allows us to rebound more quickly and effectively : climate catastrophes , like the deadly floods that paralyzed @entity98 in 2011 , can trigger disruptions to the world 's tenuous manufacturing supply chain			1
when the autumn flooding in @entity104 closed factories that fed global manufacturers , it forced shutdowns of electronics and automotive assembly lines from @entity110 to @entity111 to @entity112			1
financial contagion , like the debt crises of @entity114 and @entity115 in 2010 and 2011 , can shatter confidence in global financial markets			2
losses inflicted by the @entity121 crises reversed years ' worth of painstaking economic progress for nations and individuals worldwide			2
food shortages , like the drought - induced famine emergency in @entity127 and @entity128 in 2011 , can cause food riots locally and speculative panics globally			1
such market gyrations can contribute to protectionist measures that drive worldwide food - price spikes and further punish the most vulnerable			2
true natural disasters , like last year 's @entity34 earthquake and tsunami , can expose dangers in nationwide planning systems and calamities in power and other sectors			1
the sudden discovery of structural weakness in many of @entity34 's nuclear power plants forced the shutdown of its nuclear electricity network , with the power outage provoking an economic stall			1
disease pandemics , like the @entity153 outbreak that swept through @entity154 in 2002 and 2003 , can spread infections across borders as fast as 747s can ferry passengers across oceans			0
cyberattacks and hacking can undermine public faith in the secure data that supports global commerce			0
further , the infiltration of infrastructure networks and military systems can compromise national security			0
a @entity43 would not just build higher levees and a more regulated banking system			0
it would look at ways of setting up redundant systems so that when one system fails another takes up some of the slack			0
or when we design our flood or economic plans , can we keep in mind ways to prevent cascading failures when one part of the system collapses ? there are already some @entity183 being put in place			1
two examples come from work that the @entity187 is supporting today			0
in @entity128 , some of the poorest subsistence farmers in the country are receiving crop insurance through an innovative program spearheaded by @entity193 that allows farmers to trade work for insurance			0
this makes farmers more resilient against drought , famine and floods			0
the @entity202 is a 10 - city initiative to develop climate resilience strategies appropriate to each city			0
one of the cities where the program is operating is @entity209 , @entity210			0
their strategy included hydrology mapping , which led the city to halt building plans in vulnerable areas and has shaped the city 's future development plans			1
this planning will reduce the vulnerability of people and property to the effects of climate changes			0
this is only a start			0
how we strengthen @entity183 and interconnect them is the focus of a meeting this week in @entity228 that is bringing together global leaders and thinkers across an array of fields			0
from these discussions , a clearer way forward will be developed , that will be followed by grants aimed at achieving this goal			0
this is just one step toward a more resilient world			1
it is long past time for everyone to work together to reinforce society 's complex systems at their most vulnerable points			0
we are on our way			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			1

@entity248 : in a globalized world , local disasters can have consequences everywhere
she says the @entity34 tsunami led to part shortages that shut down assemby lines in @entity39
@entity248 : *governments* and businesses need to have contingency plans to cope with surprises
