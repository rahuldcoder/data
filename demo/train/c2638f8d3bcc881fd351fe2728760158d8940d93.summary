-- in compiling a new @entity3 greatest - hits collection , the idea was to focus on the flow , his widow , @entity7 , told @entity8 monday			1
@entity3 , shown here in 1992 , had hits with " @entity11 " and " @entity12 , " among others			2
" it 's a collection that spans his career , and we put them together in a way we thought they would just kind of flow , you know , musically , into one another , " she said of " @entity15 : songs by @entity3 , " out tuesday			1
" but , it 's all @entity3 , you know			1
" in 1970 , the @entity29 broke up			0
@entity3 burst out of the palace with " @entity31 , " a monster three - record set that featured friends like @entity34 , @entity35 and former bandmate @entity36			1
critics and fans agree the album is among the best solo offerings from a former fab			0
although five cuts from " @entity44 " got the nod on this package -- the title track , " @entity48 , " " what is life , " " @entity51 of sir @entity52 " and , of course , " @entity11 " -- this look back displays @entity3 's solo work throughout his career			1
the 19 - cut cd extends all the way through " brainwashed , " his final album , featuring that album 's chirpy " @entity58 " and the hypnotic instrumental " @entity60			1
" the @entity29 are present too			0
three live @entity3 songs from " @entity62 " -- " @entity64 , " " something " and " @entity65 " -- sound as good today as they did on that august date in 1971 at @entity66			2
and , of course , his bouncy , tongue - in - cheek " @entity71 , " from his 1987 release " cloud nine , " shows @entity3 looking back without anger			0
" i think that there is an underlying thread that he always expressed , always a bit of humor , always a bit of longing , " said @entity7			2
" you know , i do n't like to overuse the word spirituality , but , you know , he was interested in things not of this world			0
" @entity3 is a two - time inductee of the @entity86 , once as a beatle and once as a solo artist .			0
