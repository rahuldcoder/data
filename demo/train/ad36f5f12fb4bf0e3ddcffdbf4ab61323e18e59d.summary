-- @entity1 , a small collection of huts and farms in southern @entity5 , is known as a cancer village			1
@entity7 lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter 's health			2
it is where @entity13 , a husband and father and a farmer , died an agonizing death at age 30 one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer			2
his widow , @entity7 , blames his death on the brown and rust - colored water from the river , which farmers use to irrigate their crops			1
" the doctor in the hospital told us not to live here , " she told @entity0 through an interpreter			0
" he said do n't eat the rice and do n't drink the water			0
" residents of @entity1 say their river is polluted because of the iron - ore mine about 35 miles away , which is run by a nationally owned company			1
mining for iron - ore exposes naturally occurring heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium , which are both carcinogens			1
without proper water treatment facilities , water contaminated with high levels of these metals is hazardous and can possibly cause cancer			2
@entity46 , an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government , said the @entity51 mine has been polluting the @entity52 for decades			2
" i always had a dream to live in a place where there 's a clean river i can swim in , but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in @entity5 now , " she said			1
twenty - eight people in this village of 400 have died over the last 10 years from cancer -- a rate much higher than the rest of country			1
the overall mortality rate for 2006 was 137 deaths per 100,000 residents			1
pollution is a serious problem throughout @entity5			1
the @entity5 ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country			1
@entity5 , along with the @entity75 , is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases , which experts say can contribute to global warming			1
in terms of total emissions , @entity5 is projected by the @entity82 to become the world 's leading greenhouse gas producing country this year			1
it can also impact the @entity75 food supply			1
the amount of food imported from @entity5 has grown dramatically in the past decade			1
according to the @entity75 @entity90 , the @entity75 imported $ 4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from @entity5 in 2006			1
in 1995 , it was $ 800 million			2
in june , the @entity75 banned five types of fish and shrimp from @entity5 because inspectors found traces of cancer - causing chemicals and antibiotics in the products			1
small villages like @entity1 have little recourse against big companies that might be polluting their air or water			0
@entity0 talked to the mine 's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine , but said it was n't a problem that could be solved overnight			0
he said some of the smaller , privately owned mines should share blame for the problems			0
the mine has given the villagers some compensation			0
about 1,700 yuan ( $ 200 ) for the whole village , @entity46 told @entity0			1
@entity46 continues to build her case against the mine , trying to win compensation for medical testing , health care and damage to the village 's rice crops			2
she hopes to go to trial next year			0
water tests from @entity131 have concluded the @entity52 is indeed too toxic for any human use , in stark contrast to what @entity46 said the government told the villagers			0
they told her " we already meet all environmental standards , " she said			0
@entity5 is trying to address its pollution problem			2
in september , the @entity140 shut down 400 companies for water - pollution violations and suspended 249 other businesses , according to @entity144			2
and last week @entity5 announced a joint campaign with the @entity146 to clean up @entity5 's two largest river basins			1
the government hopes to have a dramatically cleaner country by august , when it will be host to the @entity151			0
it is too late for @entity7 's husband			0
she said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment			0
" he did n't want to go to the hospital because he worried we did n't have enough money to bring up our daughter , " she said			0
@entity7 told @entity0 she does n't have time to be sad			0
all she worries about is caring for daughter and her small plot of land			0
the villagers have figured out a way to pipe clean drinking water down from a nearby mountain , but they still use the dirty water to irrigate the crops			0
" they have no other choice , " @entity46 said			0
e-mail to a friend @entity0 's dr. @entity177 contributed to this report			0
