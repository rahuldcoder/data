@entity0 -- oil could turn @entity8 marshlands into open water and affect millions of migratory birds for generations , @entity2 , the senior science official and leader of the oil spill task force for @entity5 said friday			1
it has taken more than 50 years for the plant root network holding the marshlands together at the base of the @entity16 to form , he said at a briefing for reporters			2
if destroyed , the marshlands would flood and become open water , he added			1
@entity21 marshland has shrunk from 3 million acres to 1.2 million acres , or 40 percent , since the turn of the century , and toxic oil would accelerate that , he said			1
he said that more than 13 million migratory birds come to the @entity8 marshlands each winter , though the exact number is hard to determine			1
if oil enters and lingers in the @entity8 marshlands through the late summer and fall , it will affect millions migratory birds that rely on marshland resources for the winter , @entity2 said			1
" we ca n't even estimate the number ( of birds ) , " he said			0
" it 's just that kind of a place			0
" it 's difficult to to implement restoration efforts now when they do n't know where the oil is going or what the impacts are right now , he said			0
" in my career of 19 years i 've never seen a situation with so much uncertainty , " he said			0
@entity49 , a fishing tour captain for @entity51 , spoke at the same briefing about watching oil wash away 29 years of knowledge learned on the job			0
" my books are just red with cancellations right now , " he said			0
once oil enters the wetlands , it 's hard to get out so prevention is key , @entity2 said			0
cleanup efforts are in action in marshland areas already hit by oil , he said			1
for the birds , oil could kill them quickly by covering their plumage and preventing temperature control , slowly poison them through their food supply of oysters , insects and plants , or inflict " sublethal impacts " by causing reproduction problems when they head back north for winter , @entity2 said			1
if necessary , @entity2 said , flooding agriculture areas nearby should be considered in the hope some birds would migrate to those areas this winter			2
even if they created manmade marshes , however , they ca n't control the birds , he said			2
@entity49 called for sediment deposits to rebuild the marshlands so that nature could heal itself			0
@entity5 and its partners will know how to begin the restoration once the spill is stopped and damage can be evaluated , @entity2 said .			2

oil in @entity8 marshlands could destroy the root *system* of the @entity21 marsh plants and turn the areas into open water
oil will impact millions of migratory birds that rely on marshland resources for the winter
oil hurts birds by covering their plumage , poisoning their food supply and damaging reproduction
*experts* will know more of what to do for the marshes and birds once the spill is stopped
