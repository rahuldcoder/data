half of @entity1 believe @entity3 control of both chambers of @entity5 will be bad for the country , and a majority say it will in fact cause more gridlock in @entity10 , according to a new @entity13 / @entity12 nationwide poll			1
but the poll also shows the @entity3 's brand has improved over the past year , and they now are only slightly less popular than the @entity16			1
@entity16 approval levels , meanwhile , have remained static			0
according to the survey , 50 percent of @entity1 believe the @entity3 taking control of the @entity20 and the @entity21 next year will be bad for @entity1 , and 52 percent expect it to lead to more gridlock			1
another 37 percent , however , expect to see no difference in the levels of gridlock in @entity5			2
but @entity1 seem to believe the @entity3 should be the ones to budge			2
sixty - eight percent of @entity1 polled say the @entity3 is n't cooperating enough with president @entity27 , while 57 percent say it 's @entity27 who 's not cooperating enough with the @entity3			1
democrats remain the more popular of the two parties — but not by much			0
forty - four percent of @entity1 view the @entity16 favorably , to the 50 percent who view it unfavorably			1
but @entity3 have rebounded since october of 2013 , increasing their favorability by 11 percent			2
now , 41 percent of @entity1 view the @entity3 favorably , while 52 percent view it negatively			2
@entity27 remains underwater in the poll as well , with 48 percent of respondents viewing him favorably while 51 percent view him unfavorably			0
@entity27 's persistently low approval rating contributed to his party 's resounding defeat this midterm election cycle , and the @entity3 regaining control of the @entity21			0
indeed , the @entity13 / @entity12 poll shows that a vast majority of @entity1 — 74 percent — saw the @entity3 's wins earlier this month as a repudiation of @entity16 policies , far more than the 16 percent who saw it as a mandate for @entity3 to pass their own			1
and there 's one proposal in particular being floated by some republicans that does n't sit well with @entity1 — a potential government shutdown			0
only 17 percent of @entity1 would see it as no problem at all if the government shut down for a few days			0
a fifth would see it as a crisis , and another 39 percent would see it as a major problem			0
a shutdown lasting weeks would be seen as even more dire for @entity1			0
thirty - nine percent would see such a shutdown as a crisis at that point , and another 38 percent would see it as a major problem			0
some @entity3 have suggested the party should attach a measure defunding implementation of the president 's unilateral action on deportations to a must - pass spending bill as a way to respond to what they see as an unlawful abuse of executive power			2
@entity27 has indicated he 'd veto any such approach , however , effectively shutting down the government			0
while some of the @entity3 proponents of such a tactic have argued the party could avoid responsibility for the shutdown , the @entity13 / @entity12 poll suggests that , regardless of the reason , @entity3 would take the blame			1
fifty percent of @entity1 say @entity3 would be more responsible for a shutdown , while 33 percent would peg the blame on the president			1
