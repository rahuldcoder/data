@entity0 -- the military sought monday to persuade @entity3 to end the demonstrations and strikes that culminated last friday in the resignation of the president , and urged their countrymen to get back to work			1
though efforts are on track to " realize the legitimate demands of the people for a true democratic environment , " widespread strikes and demonstrations continued monday in certain state sectors , " even though normality has been restored , " the @entity19 said in a statement			2
it cited " negative consequences " of continued unrest , including harming national security , adversely affecting the state 's ability to get necessary goods to the public , disrupting production and operations , delaying the nation 's return to " day - to - day life , " adversely affecting the economy and " creating an atmosphere that gives the opportunity to irresponsible persons to commit illegitimate acts			1
" @entity41 's abdication leaves a council of generals , led by defense minister @entity44 , in charge of the @entity48 world 's most populous nation			1
since friday , the military has dissolved parliament , suspended the constitution and vowed to remain in charge until elections can be held in six months or so			1
in addition , it has declared a curfew from midnight until 6 a.m. the @entity19 said it would appoint a committee to propose changes to the constitution , which would then be submitted to voters			1
the council will have the power to issue new laws during the transition , according to a communique read on state television			1
the military now finds itself confronting the economic problems that fueled the revolt , including massive youth unemployment and economic underdevelopment			1
@entity72 , @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity73 , said sunday that the generals have made restoring security and reviving the economy their top priorities			1
however , a leading opposition figure said sunday that the military must explain its plans in more detail or see a resumption of the demonstrations that drove @entity41 from office			1
" they need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to the people and tell us what is in store for us , " @entity84 told @entity1 's " @entity92			1
" another opposition figure , @entity93 , said monday that a man with a knife attempted to attack him while he was in @entity97 meeting with supporters , who thwarted the man 's attempt			1
the man then attempted to flee , but was arrested by the army , @entity93 said he was told			2
widespread strikes and demonstrations occurred monday around the country , with thousands of state workers from various ministries demonstrating for better pay and better work conditions , witnesses told @entity1			1
the unrest has nearly emptied tourist hotels			2
in the @entity113 resort town of @entity114 , where @entity41 is reportedly holed up at a villa , " we are losing daily something like $ 20 ( million ) to $ 30 million -- at least in this area , " said @entity119 , secretary general of the @entity120			0
in @entity123 , @entity122 foreign secretary @entity121 told the @entity124 he had encouraged the @entity3 government " to make further moves to accommodate the views of opposition figures			0
" he said he was heartened to hear @entity3 prime minister @entity129 say that members of the opposition should be included in a reshuffled @entity132 during the next week			0
@entity121 called for the release of all those detained during the 18 days of demonstrations that preceded @entity41 's resignation and said he wants " a clear timetable for fair and parliamentary elections			1
" he added that he welcomes the military council 's commitment to " all regional and international obligations and treaties			1
" monday 's admonition from the military came as mourners gathered at a marble memorial in @entity0 's @entity147 to honor the victims of clashes , which began january 25			1
" our country is forever indebted to these warriors , " said @entity150 , who visited the memorial			0
some people placed flowers next to pictures of some of the more than 300 people estimated to have died during the 18 days of conflict that led to the ouster of the 82 - year - old president , who had ruled with an iron fist for nearly 30 years			0
a spokeswoman for @entity165 called the estimate " conservative			0
" @entity167 said it was based on the group 's visits to just eight hospitals -- five in @entity0 , two in @entity172 and one in @entity174			1
" we were not able to access many other hospitals , " she said			0
@entity167 expressed concern about the military , too			1
" it 's unclear to what extent there are any limits on the power of the military , and that , obviously , is something that causes the human rights community some concern , " she said			1
but most @entity3 seem ready to give the military a chance to guide the country from dictatorship to democracy			1
" until they do something that 's really huge and negative , i 'm going to trust them , because we need that trust now , " said television talk - show host and journalist @entity192			1
" the genie is out of the bottle			0
@entity3 have now managed to rediscover themselves			0
i 'm so proud of this part of the story			0
yes , it will always be tempting for an army man to stick to power			2
but they , too , probably realize now this is not a good idea			0
" the direction of the military was just one of many uncertainties that remain			2
the status of @entity41 , who is reportedly staying in @entity114 , is a mystery			0
some @entity3 are demanding he stand trial for crimes , including the demonstrators ' deaths			0
others are demanding an immediate repeal of @entity3 's nearly 30 - year - old emergency law , which allows the government to arrest people without charge , and the formation of a civilian body to oversee the transition to a new government			2
on monday , @entity147 , the center of the protests and the subsequent celebrations , remained a focus of activity , though a much diminished one			1
military police dispersed about 70 protesters from the square monday and did not allow members of the news media to take pictures of the event			2
while the army detained protesters who tried to remain in the square , officials said they released the protesters after removing them from the square and used the practice to disperse the crowds			2
a group of police officers joined demonstrators monday , a sharp contrast to the clashes between police and protesters during the early days of the uprising			0
" we did n't want to attack the protesters , but they ( our superiors ) told us if we did n't , they would put us in jail ... if we disobeyed their orders , " one of the officers , @entity259 , said monday			0
their role in supporting the @entity41 regime through the years has left the police widely unpopular			0
in the aftermath of the demonstrations , some police stations were looted and set ablaze			0
though many residents recognize the role of police is critical to any society , only traffic cops were back on the streets of @entity0 monday			0
regular police , afraid of being harassed , do n't walk their beats , a spokesman said			0
to make up for their absence , some people have organized neighborhood - watch groups			0
events in @entity3 have been watched closely throughout the region			0
for the third day in a row , clashes broke out monday between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in @entity286 's capital of @entity287			2
about 200 anti-government protesters rallied outside @entity289 calling for regime change			0
and on monday , @entity292 foreign minister @entity291 told @entity295 radio network @entity293 that the country 's state of emergency -- in place for almost two decades -- will be lifted in the " coming days			2
" the announcement came two days after anti-government protesters in @entity292 chanted , " change the power ! " security forces clashed with the crowds saturday in @entity305 and detained roughly 100 protesters , according to the opposition @entity307			1
ambassador @entity72 said it was a " matter of pride " for @entity3 that their revolution was " organized and peaceful			0
" @entity1 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 and journalist @entity322 contributed to this report .			2
