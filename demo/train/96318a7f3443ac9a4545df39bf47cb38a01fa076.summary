@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a traffic - choked street in @entity1 's capital , @entity0 , @entity3 walks through his family 's shop to an empty back room			2
only there does he feel safe enough to explain why he 's afraid			2
" well , it 's because probably the killers are still out there , " he says			2
the killers he refers to are those who @entity3 believes are responsible for the murder of his grandfather , one of between 500,000 and 1 million people estimated by human rights groups to have been killed by military death squads during anti-communist purges across @entity20 in 1965 and 1966			1
the mass killings were sparked by a failed coup on september 30 , 1965 and the murder of a number of generals in the military			1
a major general in the army at the time , @entity27 blamed the coup on communists , ousted president @entity32 -- the country 's first post-independence leader -- and sanctioned the hunt for those responsible			1
after assuming the presidency in 1967 , @entity27 ruled @entity20 for 31 years until 1998			1
many contend those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic @entity41 , or anyone with left - wing views			2
@entity3 describes how his grandfather had been kidnapped from his home late one night , targeted he believes because of his work with a government organization set up to integrate ethnic @entity41 and local @entity47			0
" everything broke down after that			0
the family business and their home was burned down , they lost everything and had to start from scratch , " says @entity3			0
" i am pretty sure one uncle of mine knows who did it			0
( the murderers ) are still alive and around and i still have my fear			0
" for thousands like @entity61 in @entity1 and across the rest of @entity20 , confronting that fear and addressing this brutal period in the country 's history is something most have been unwilling or unable to do openly			1
many worry that publicly dissenting from official versions of the events and coup -- ingrained through @entity27 - era propaganda , like the 1984 film " treachery of @entity74 " -- could lead to retribution from those connected to the killings			1
more often than not , killers and victims ' families still live in the same communities			1
" it 's like the @entity85 winning and then they are still in the government , " says @entity3			0
" people live with fear , they are afraid to get involved			0
" however things are slowly changing			0
that @entity61 is now facing his fears in part comes from the impact of " @entity94 , " a new documentary by @entity97 director @entity96			1
while books and other films have told some of the survivors ' stories , @entity99 's film recounts for the first time the violence from the perpetrators ' perspective			1
captivating , powerful and at times bizarre , it follows the boastful but ultimately conflicted @entity110 , a low - level gangster turned executioner , as he reenacts how he and others murdered hundreds of people			0
as well as the moral and personal journey taken by @entity118 , the film also shows the links between the murderers , paramilitary groups and government officials			1
" rather than showing @entity20 something they do n't already know , ( the film ) exposes something that they already know to be true and what they are afraid to address , " says @entity96 , who spent around seven years making the film around the @entity125 city of @entity126 , with a largely local crew who had to be credited anonymously			1
" ( the survivors told me ) we need a film that comes to @entity20 like the child in " @entity144 " saying that the king is naked ... everybody already knows it , but if it can be said so powerfully , so forcefully , so emotionally by the perpetrators themselves , then there will be no going back			1
" at two secret screenings last december and february , @entity3 showed the film to members of a local film club			0
some were too afraid to even watch it , while others thought it could stir up new trouble			0
" some in the audience asked , ' why are you opening up old wounds ? ' but the wounds are still open wide and people are still afraid , " says @entity3			0
others , particularly the younger generation , have become emboldened by the film and the chance for greater openness , like @entity164 , a member of @entity166 65 , a @entity1 - based group comprised of victims ' family members			1
" @entity94 gave us an opportunity to talk about the events , " he says at group meeting just a few hundred meters from one of @entity1 's most popular tourist beaches			1
" ( the killings ) happened here in @entity1 and show the dark side of the paradise island , but also the dark side of family life			0
" @entity183 's grandfather disappeared one night in early 1966 and was never seen again			0
through slow and at time painful discussions with family members more is being learned about the difficult period			0
@entity183 admits he did n't know until recently that a village in western @entity1 is called " @entity191 " because it was where up to 600 people are believed have been slaughtered			0
the perpetrator says @entity193 , a fellow @entity166 65 group member , is believed to be the head of another village , who is known more openly for his charisma and dancing skills			1
like @entity110 in @entity99 's film , @entity193 says the village leader was not shy to boast of his murderous exploits , believing that he carried out his violent acts with impunity and for the right reasons			2
however , since the film and the growing groundswell of discussion about the events it relates to , he has become less inclined to boast about his exploits , says @entity193			2
monday , september 30 is the anniversary of the 1965 coup and the date @entity99 has chosen to make the film available to everyone in @entity20 to watch online			1
he decided not to try for a general cinema release for the film , fearing that if it was banned and people watched it , it could legitimize more violence			0
" somehow i think that because @entity20 is moving on , the film is able to have its impact , " he says			1
" ten years ago maybe too many people were actually involved , complicit with the military dictatorship and too invested in its power structures ... but now younger @entity20 are saying ' i want my country to function			2
' " while welcomed by @entity229 65 , there are real fears widespread viewings of the film could stir anger and reprisals from younger members of survivors ' families and a new conflict with paramilitary groups			2
" i do worry that there may be a new conflict , " says @entity240 , at the @entity242 65 meeting			0
" after @entity27 's ' @entity245 ' collapsed we thought ( the perpetrators ) would be found guilty			2
" so far , official attempts to revisit the events of 1965 and 1966 have failed			1
while @entity20 's @entity251 published a report last year stating the anti-communist purge was a gross violation of human rights , it was not taken any further by the country 's attorney general			1
a draft bill for a @entity259 also failed in 2006			0
" how do you establish the truth after all this time ? asks @entity193			0

anti-communist purges across @entity20 sparked by failed coup on september 30 , 1965
many victims ' families still unable to talk openly about the period when up to 1 million believed killed
documentary that shows events from perpetrators ' view having impact on changing *attitudes*
*filmmaker* says film will be free for all in @entity20 to watch online from september 30 , the coup 's anniversary
