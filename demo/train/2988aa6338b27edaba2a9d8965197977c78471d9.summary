@entity1 , @entity0 -- i have a confession			0
as a music style , heavy metal has completely passed me by			1
i do n't understand it			0
i 'm not even sure i want to			0
" bring your daughter to the slaughter , " bellows @entity9 's @entity8			2
why would i want to do that ? why would i want to listen to anyone even suggesting i do that ? outside the @entity18 in @entity20 's @entity19 our intrepid reporter tries out her rock moves			2
while the thought of spending the evening head banging leaves me longing for an expensive glass of merlot , slightly fruity , and perhaps a long sit down , i ca n't escape the feeling that i 'm somehow missing out			0
as a child of the 70s , how could i have missed the birth of a wildly popular new music genre right in the next decade ? even at the end of the 80s , when @entity9 was releasing its " first ten years " compilation of greatest hits , i would have been sixteen ( or thereabouts ) , the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long - haired , rebellious rocker in tight leather pants			1
there 's only one thing for it -- a crash course in all things metal with the man who knows , self - confessed metalhead @entity47 , who also presents the chart show for 24 - hour @entity53 rock and metal radio station @entity50			1
i meet him at the @entity50 studios in @entity20			1
it smells of stale sweat			0
i 'm pleased to see @entity47 is wearing the traditional heavy metal attire of black t - shirt and black jeans			1
obviously i 'm going to have to go and buy a t - shirt , perhaps one with a skull on it			1
" you can wear anything you want , " @entity47 assures me			1
" you 'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high - powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal			1
they ca n't go around dressed as i 'm necessarily dressed now all the time because it does n't fit into their jobs			0
" fortunately for @entity47 , his job as heavy metal journalist and broadcaster almost requires him to look the part			1
he 's been involved in the scene since the late 1960s , when he fell for a young heavy metal group called @entity85			1
his main allegiance later shifted to @entity87 , but when it comes to music styles he 's not fussy			2
" i 've got eclectic tastes , " he says			0
" i 'm happy to listen to @entity91 , listen to @entity92 , to all sorts			0
" finally , we 've found some common ground			0
if there 's anyone who can convince me of the joys of heavy metal , it 's someone who also appreciates the soothing , melodic tones of @entity91			1
i 've heard someone compare heavy metal to pantomime , i say			1
surely that ca n't be true ? " it 's absolutely panto , " @entity47 enthuses , adding " @entity108 said that any film should start with a climax and build it from there			1
and that 's what metal does			1
it starts with a big , big stage show and builds it from there			0
of course it 's panto			2
it 's ' he 's behind you ' , it 's the whole larger than life character , it 's circus , it 's frivolity			1
" he hastens to add that a lot of time and effort goes into staging the shows , and from that perspective , it 's completely serious			2
the problem with heavy metal , @entity47 says , is that the mainstream media misrepresented it for years			1
" every time the mainstream media used to cover it in the 70s and 80s , it was done from the point of view that ' this is weird , we do n't understand it , we 're going to go away not understanding it but we 're going to present it to you anyway , ' " he says			0
heavy metal was painted as the dark preserve of working class men who wore denim and leather and were , for the most part , sexist			1
that 's even before you take into account accusations of devil worship and @entity154 leveled at the genre by @entity157 activists in the 80s			2
" you can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking ' i do n't get it and i do n't want to get it , ' " @entity47 says			2
now many more people " get it			0
" some 30,000 people listen to @entity50 each week , many of them women			2
" it 's ended up being i think a music that attracts if not fifty percent female fans then certainly a very big minority			2
the fact is metal has never tried to exclude women			0
" so what of lyrics like " bring your daughter to the slaughter " ? " ' @entity180 ' was actually written for a movie , " @entity47 explains , " one of the @entity183 movies			2
however , it is not about killing people			0
@entity186 was a metaphor for the party			0
so it was actually a fun representation			0
@entity191 has never openly espoused violence towards anybody			0
" it should be stated here that there are varying degrees of heavy metal , from the hair metal of carefully - coifured @entity200 to the black art of @entity204 doom metal band @entity202			1
" what makes @entity202 so heavy is that they literally make your bowels rumble , " @entity47 says			1
" they are so intense			0
but it 's also hypnotic			0
and strangely soothing , " he adds			0
dozens of sub-categories of metal have evolved to include black metal , stoner metal , thrash metal , power metal , goth metal , death metal and grind core , to name a few			2
what binds them all is a fierce dedication to the style of music and an admirable loyalty to their chosen bands			1
there seems to be none of the fickleness associated with the pop world where young performers are routinely thrown on the scrapheap after a few hits -- or flops			2
as @entity47 says , it 's not unusual for bands to have a career that spans decades			1
@entity9 has been going for almost 30 years			0
so is there any age when heavy metal fans should retire gracefully from the scene ? " absolutely not , no , no , no , " @entity47 says , looking slightly shocked			1
" if you love it and enjoy it why should you have give it up because you reach a certain age ? definitely not			0
" it 's not too late for me then			0

@entity47 of @entity50 conveys the joys of metal to the *unconverted*
heavy metal *concerts* likened to panto , " it 's circus , it 's frivolity , " @entity47 says
metal ' *uniform* ' of black t - shirt , jeans and leather apparently *unnecessary*
metalheads display fierce loyalty to their bands , *unlike* fickle world of pop
