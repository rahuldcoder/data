a 29 - year - old computer technician for a @entity2 defense contractor leaked details of a top - secret @entity2 program that collects vast streams of phone and @entity8 data , @entity2 and @entity10 newspapers revealed sunday			1
" my sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them , " the source , @entity11 , told @entity10 's the @entity12 , one of the papers that broke stories on the program last week			1
the @entity25 also disclosed sunday that @entity11 was the source on its stories			1
@entity11 is a former technical assistant for the @entity29 and has been working at the @entity30 , the @entity2 electronic intelligence service , for the past four years , the newspaper reported			1
he said he walked away from a six - figure job in @entity33 for the computer consulting firm @entity34 and has holed up in a hotel in @entity36 in preparation for the expected fallout from his disclosures			0
" i 'm willing to sacrifice all of that because i ca n't in good conscience allow the @entity2 government to destroy privacy , internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they 're secretly building , " he said			1
video : what did @entity30 want with @entity53 data ? the @entity12 reported wednesday that @entity53 had been ordered to hand over telephone records detailing the time , location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from april 25 to july 19			0
an order from a @entity2 court that oversees @entity2 surveillance efforts backed up the demand , the newspaper reported			1
thursday , the @entity12 and the @entity25 disclosed the existence of @entity65 , a program they said allows @entity30 analysts to extract the details of customer activities -- including " audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails , documents " and other materials -- from computers at @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and other internet firms			0
@entity11 said the @entity30 's reach poses " an existential threat to democracy			1
" he said he had hoped the @entity84 administration would end the programs once it took office in 2009 , but instead , he said , president @entity84 " advanced the very policies that i thought would be reined in			0
" " i do n't see myself as a hero , because what i 'm doing is self - interested , " he said			0
" i do n't want to live in a world where there 's no privacy , and therefore no room for intellectual exploration and creativity			0
" will he be extradited ? the first call for @entity11 's prosecution came shortly after his identity was made public , from rep. @entity100 , the chairman of a @entity101 and a member of the @entity103			1
" if @entity11 did in fact leak the @entity30 data as he claims , the @entity2 government must prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law and begin extradition proceedings at the earliest date , " @entity100 , @entity105 - @entity104 , said in a written statement			1
" the @entity2 must make it clear that no country should be granting this individual asylum			1
this is a matter of extraordinary consequence to @entity2 intelligence			2
" though @entity36 is part of communist - ruled @entity122 , the former @entity10 colony has a free press and tolerates political dissent under a semi-autonomous government			0
@entity36 's extradition treaty with the @entity2 has exceptions for " political " crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the " defense , foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy " of either party			1
@entity136 , director of the @entity137 , had no direct comment on @entity11 's admission , but noted , " any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law			2
" a law enforcement official told @entity147 the @entity2 must charge @entity11 before a process to seek his extradition can begin , adding that any talk of such action is " jumping ahead " of where things stand in the case			1
the @entity155 declined to comment , citing an ongoing investigation into the leak			0
leaders of the intelligence committees in @entity160 defended the program sunday			1
@entity162 , the chairwoman of the @entity103 , said it helped lead to convictions in two cases : -- @entity166 , an @entity168 - born @entity167 man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in @entity104			1
-- @entity170 , who pleaded guilty to conducting advance surveillance for the @entity173 jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in @entity176 , @entity177 , in 2008 , killing 164 people			0
" these programs are within the law , " @entity162 , @entity179 , told @entity183 's " @entity182			2
" and rep. @entity184 , the chairman of the @entity185 , told @entity183 , " the inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what @entity162 and i know this program really does			1
" " the instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots , prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified , " said @entity184 , @entity191			0
" that 's what 's so hard about this			0
" @entity84 defends @entity30 program @entity136 : programs were authorized by @entity160 @entity136 's office declassified some details of the programs , which it said were " conducted under authorities widely known and discussed , and fully debated and authorized by @entity160			1
" @entity2 officials said earlier that phone - call data is n't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terrorism , and only then on the authority of a judge			1
officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the internet activity of @entity2 citizens or residents , even when they travel overseas			1
and @entity84 tried to reassure @entity2 about the programs friday , saying , " nobody is listening to your telephone calls			2
" @entity136 's office said @entity65 was created in 2008 , targets " foreign targets located outside the @entity2 " and gets reviewed by the administration , @entity160 and judges			1
and @entity184 told reporters sunday that " there is not a target on @entity2			2
" some shrug at @entity30 snooping : privacy 's already dead but @entity230 , the lead author of the @entity12 pieces , told @entity183 's " @entity182 " that the articles show the @entity30 has n't leveled with members of @entity160 who have expressed concerns about the scope of electronic surveillance			1
he said @entity2 need an " open , honest debate about whether that 's the kind of country that we want to live in			2
" " these are things that the @entity2 people have a right to know , " said @entity230 , a lawyer and civil - liberties advocate			2
" the only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and the way they exercise power in the dark			0
" @entity167 @entity250 sen. @entity249 , who has long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on @entity2 , said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week 's disclosures			1
" maybe @entity2 think this is ok , but i think the line has been drawn too far towards ' we 're going to invade your privacy , ' versus ' we 're going to respect your privacy , ' " @entity249 told @entity147 's @entity257			2
@entity249 is a member of the @entity103			0
he and sen. @entity263 , @entity264 , have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of @entity2 ' phone records but have been limited in what they could say publicly			1
@entity249 told @entity147 that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown			0
" it 's unclear to me we 've developed any intelligence through the metadata program that 's led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means , " @entity249 said , pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and @entity184 that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records			2
' i do not expect to see home again ' the @entity12 reported that @entity11 grew up in @entity286 and @entity287			2
he joined the @entity288 in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident			0
he never completed a high - school diploma but learned computer skills at a community college in @entity287			0
he started his career as a security guard for an @entity30 facility at the @entity297 , then went to work for the @entity29 in internet security			0
in 2009 , he got the first of several jobs with private contractors that worked with the @entity30			0
in a statement issued sunday afternoon , @entity34 said @entity11 had worked for the company for less than three months			2
reports that he had leaked @entity2 secrets were " shocking " and if true , " represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm , " the company said			0
@entity11 told the @entity12 that he left for @entity36 on may 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned			0
" i do not expect to see home again , " he told the paper , acknowledging the risk of imprisonment over his actions			0
" you ca n't come up against the world 's most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept the risk , " he said			0
" if they want to get you , over time they will			0

sen. @entity162 says program info aided two declassified cases
" if they want to get you , over time they will , " @entity11 says
@entity2 officials say the program is overseen by courts and @entity160
senators have expressed concerns about the scope of the program before
