@entity0 -- " are @entity4 - @entity3 women really that different from women of other ethnicities ? " that was the major question i wanted to ask @entity9 , blogger and author of " @entity11			1
" @entity12 first told great stories about her numerous firsts , although she made it clear that she does n't define herself by what she does			1
growing up , she wanted to be the first black female @entity20 justice			2
she did become the first @entity4 - @entity3 female to be elected to the student body government at @entity23			0
and she went on to become a lawyer			0

and the author , journalist and blogger loves to write			2
" your blog is called @entity37			0
what is that definition ? " i asked			0
it 's not very good at all , she responded			0
she said too many people want to stereotype black women as angry and strident			1
but she said having images of @entity46 on a world stage is a game changer			1
she insisted that not everyone has to be like the first lady but that she is a great role model			0
" are black women really any different from any other women ? " i ask			1
" no , not at all , " she said adamantly " and that is the real redefining thing that i want us to all take away from my book and anything that you see			2
black women are women like everybody else			1
" she discussed having lost a job , bouncing back , not being viewed seriously in the workplace , women being viewed as angry and other issues in her book			1
she said every woman can relate to these struggles , no matter the ethnicity			0

he said a secure man would not be			0
she agreed , saying the research for her book showed that a man was not intimidated by accomplished black women ; that men want someone with a great personality , who will treat them with respect and who will leave the baggage behind			1
@entity12 said , " i consider myself lucky to have achieved a lifelong dream of mine to publish my first book ; a serious , generational nonfiction book on the lives of accomplished black women in @entity3 living in this new ' age of @entity46			1
' stereotypes still define black women and , for that matter , most women in our culture			1
but as we all know , stereotypes are n't funny when they follow you everywhere			0
" we made small talk easily , laughing as though we had known each other for years			0
it was much later that i learned she was nervous , but felt at home once she sat down			2
she later wrote , " it was like i had been waiting to do this my whole life			0
we often think that successful people have no fears			0
the truth is , successful people are quite intimate with fear -- they just face their fears and rise instead to meet their dreams			0
