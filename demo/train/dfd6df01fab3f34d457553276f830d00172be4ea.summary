after two grueling months with no word from their loved ones , relatives of those on @entity2 will have to wait two more months before the search resumes underwater			1
the @entity7 - 21 drone is completing its final mission in the @entity9 on wednesday , marking the end of the underwater hunt -- for now			1
with no tangible evidence found by the drone , which costs an estimated $ 40,000 a day to operate , search officials are regrouping and preparing to deploy more high - tech equipment			1
only a handful of companies have such devices , which will likely include towed sonar , an autonomous underwater vehicle with mounted sonar and optical imaging equipment , @entity23 officials said			1
soliciting those companies and negotiating contracts will take time , and officials have said they want a single private contractor to lead the next stage of the search			1
that phase , which aims to scour 60,000 square kilometers , probably wo n't start for at least two months			2
the cost ? about $ 60 million			0
uncharted territory in the meantime , @entity33 is using a specialized ship to map the ocean floor in a remote part of the @entity9 -- something that 's never been done before			1
while the @entity40 can provide greater resolution than deep - towed sonar devices , the drone could only go about 4.5 kilometers deep			1
it 's unclear how deep the water is in the expanded search area because " it 's never been mapped , " @entity23 deputy prime minister @entity43 said earlier this month			2
@entity33 's @entity49 ship will be joined by a contracted commercial survey vessel in june , the @entity47 said			1
while 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane , @entity51 , @entity33 and @entity23 have held high - level talks about the future of the search			1
@entity51 is where the the plane is from , @entity33 had more than 100 passengers on board , and @entity23 had six passengers on board and is close to the stretch of the @entity9 where searchers have focused their hunt			1
@entity23 has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $ 60 million , with the breakdown of exactly who 's going to pay for what yet to be determined			2
satellite data released with the underwater search on hiatus , analysts are combing through a 47 - page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the plane and the @entity81 company @entity80 's satellite system			1
relatives of passengers have been clamoring for the release of satellite data for months			2
it was the satellite data , along with other information , that led officials to zero in on a search area in the southern @entity9			1
and some families suspect officials may be searching in the wrong spot			2
but the document released tuesday does n't provide the whole picture			0
it 's " intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs , " notes at the beginning of the document say			0
some passengers ' families , unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane 's fate , say they want an independent analysis of the complex information -- a process that could take weeks			0
@entity110 safety analyst @entity109 said certain key elements , which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion , are missing from the data in the document			0
" there 's not enough information to say whether they made an error , " he said			0
" i think we 're still going to be looking for more			0
" @entity80 ceo @entity120 acknowledged tuesday that the company did n't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane 's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the @entity51 government , which is leading the search			2
" we 'd be perfectly happy to put that model out , " @entity120 told @entity110 's " @entity131			0
" but @entity120 also said the publicized data , along with engine and radar data , are enough for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions			0
@entity138 , whose partner , @entity139 , was on the missing jet , said she was " annoyed " that @entity80 and @entity51 authorities had n't released everything they used to reach their conclusions			0
" i see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us , " she said			0
regardless of what information has been released , two pressing questions remain -- where is the plane , and what went wrong ? is @entity80 right ? did @entity80 data point @entity2 searchers in wrong direction ?			0

the @entity7 - 21 drone wraps up its final underwater mission wednesday
officials are trying to solicit a private contractor to lead the next stage of the search
that stage will use more high - tech equipment , *possibly* in two months
meanwhile , a @entity33 ship is trying to map ocean floor
