-- @entity1 announced wednesday that it 's adding new photo tagging and collage features			1
it 's no $ 2 billion purchase of a virtual - reality gaming company , but the update will have an impact on @entity1 's 241 million users who post to the service each month			2
the change lets you tag up to 10 people in one photo			2
previously , you could work around @entity1 's lack of image tags by just mentioning people from the photo in the tweet itself			1
but with precious few characters to work with , that could gobble up a lot of tweet real estate , especially if you were taking crowded group selfies			0
image tagging is not an original idea			0
@entity27 has offered photo tagging features for a long time and @entity30 added its own photo - tagging option last year			1
@entity1 also is now making it possible to pack more images into messages with a new collage option that lets you share up to four photos in a single tweet			1
select the images and it will tile them into a neat rectangle			0
previously you would need a third - party app to make a collage			0
these are just the latest features to make the jump between major social networks , which happily borrow the most popular aspects of competing services			0
last summer , @entity27 copied one of @entity1 's best features when it added clickable hashtags to its newsfeed , and it tried to clone @entity54 with its @entity56 application			1
when @entity1 added short , 6 - second videos with its @entity59 service , @entity30 quickly followed suit with 15 - second videos			1
the new @entity1 image tags wo n't count against a tweet 's 140 - character limit			1
any tagged images will pop up under the interactions tab , just like regular tweets in which you are mentioned			0
@entity1 is rolling out the new features to users starting with its @entity72 and @entity73 apps			2
once you have the new powers , you can start identifying friends in images by selecting an image and then hitting the " who 's in this photo ? " link below it			0
if you 're not comfortable being tagged in images , immediately take a trip to the @entity1 privacy settings			2
the default setting for the photo tagging is " allow anyone to tag me in photos			1
" it can be changed so that only people you already follow can tag you , or it can be turned off completely			2
it 's also easy to untag yourself from any photos			0
tap the three dots below the tweet and select " remove tag from photo			0
" people who have their @entity1 accounts set to private can only tag people who follow them , and the default privacy setting for protected accounts is to not allow people to tag them in images at all			1
if you 've blocked someone on @entity1 , they can not tag you .			0

@entity1 has added the ability to tag people in photos
the feature is already very *familiar* to @entity27 users , who have had it a long time
the default privacy setting lets anyone tag you in an image , but it can be turned off
@entity1 also adds option to share up to four photos in a single tweet
