the @entity0 is a festival spun out of the maker movement that brings together science , crafting , robots , steampunk , drones and @entity6			1
it 's a grassroots celebration of @entity9 , or the do - it - yourself culture that has helped boost @entity11 , @entity12 and other sites			2
and in the @entity0 's eighth year , organizers are having increasing success packaging and exporting the unique @entity0 brand around the world			1
the original @entity19 event was held last weekend in @entity20 , @entity21 , and organizers estimate it drew more than 120,000 people			1
for the past five years , @entity25 has also run an official @entity0 in @entity26 , on the grounds of the old @entity28 in @entity29			0
the movement also is gaining popularity internationally , so @entity0 is planning a large october event in @entity33 , home of @entity34 founder @entity34			0
but in true maker spirit , most of the satellite events are homegrown			0
there will be more than 120 smaller @entity40 put on in communities around the world in 2013 , up from just 60 last year			1
while @entity25 does n't directly organize these smaller events , it does provide locals with connections and a playbook on how to put on their own @entity0 - branded events			0
the colorful events are part carnival , part theme park , part crafts festival and part science museum			1
they 're a big attraction for older hobbyists , younger makers and crafters , and families who want to expose their kids to the creative side of science and engineering and get them more involved with hands - on projects			1
" it 's almost sort of the new @entity70 , where people get to participate in inventing and creating the future versus just watching it and walking through it , " said @entity66 , @entity25 vice president and co-founder of the @entity0			1
some of the event 's most popular attractions were at the @entity19 festival this past weekend , including a @entity79 and @entity80 demonstration , large sculptures originally made for the @entity83 gathering , and the car - smashing @entity84 , which is a giant @entity86 device			1
smaller activities like lock - picking and soldering lessons are also big hits			0
but the fastest - growing categories at @entity40 are @entity34 ( a tiny electronic controller ) , the single - board computer @entity94 , @entity95 printing and personal fabrication , according to @entity66			1
the @entity98 was kept dark for light - centric displays like a giant @entity101 game , a glowing abstract forest , and the @entity104 musical performance group , which dazzled the crowd with its @entity107 coils			0
the event had a heavy focus on the local community and featured booths for @entity19 groups devoted to @entity6 , robotics , model tanks , and even building @entity116 robots from " @entity117			1
" in the @entity119 , the makers gave talks and small companies sold their wares for crafters and makers			0
there were around 1,000 makers at this year 's @entity19 event			2
some 150 of them were kids , a 60 % increase from the previous year			1
organizers think a key part of getting children more engaged in science is exposing them to these types of interactive activities			1
their parents seem to agree			0
" i think it 's part nostalgic , " said @entity66			0
" as parents are aging they remember great experiences with their grandparents , and i think they 're probably trying to figure out how to make this happen to their own families , especially as schools get further and further away from hands - on activities			0
" even the youngest kids were making things at the festival			2
at the @entity155 tables , children and adults made crafts like duct - tape wallets			2
nearby , a hill covered with used cardboard , tape , scissors and other supplies was a hotbed of imagination for kids built elaborate forts and costumes			0
@entity0 attendees are a faithful bunch , often returning year after year to their local events			2
@entity171 , decked out in a purple velvet coat , cat - eye glasses and fanciful hat at the @entity19 fair , sells bags at @entity83 and all the major craft and maker shows			0
but she said the @entity0 is her favorite because it combines a little bit of everything .			2

the 2013 @entity183 took place last weekend in @entity20 , @entity21
the popular annual festival combines science , crafts , robotics and steampunk fashion
organizers estimate it drew more than 120,000 people
