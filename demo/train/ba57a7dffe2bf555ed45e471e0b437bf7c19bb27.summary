-- when you 're sitting on your couch on a quiet monday night searching the web for a decent trending topic and the almighty @entity6 gods give you @entity7 , you take it			1
and if you happen to have a goat , it 's polite to offer them a sacrifice			2
i was fresh out of goats , so i murdered a @entity15			0
and the @entity6 gods were pleased			1
truth be told , i had no idea who @entity7 was			1
but it sounded like a good topic , just so long as he was n't making headlines for cruising the suburbs in a windowless van			2
so , why the trend ? well , it turns out @entity7 is an old - school @entity31 wrestler who had just made a blast - from - the - past appearance on " monday night @entity33			1
" i guess this was kind of a big deal			0
i do n't know -- i 'm not really into wrestling			2
in fact , the closest i ever came to a real match was when two of my college friends battled each other inside an old @entity43 to see who could be first out the sunroof			0
we lost a lot of good brain cells that day			0
anyway , according to the @entity31 website , the evil @entity7 was known for scaring children and making them cry			1
but @entity7 would also bludgeon his opponents with a prosthetic limb			1
that leads to years of serious therapy			0
" so , tell me how @entity7 made you feel			1
" " you mean before or after i went home and cut off my genitals ? " of course , the really good wrestlers have their signature moves , and @entity7 was also known for utilizing something called the " @entity63			1
" apparently he would butt - slam his opponent 's head while viciously breaking wind			1
@entity7 was a classy clown			1
i actually found one good example of this on @entity71 , which shows @entity7 dropping the @entity63 move on some guy named @entity74			1
i 'm not saying my people are bad wrestlers or poor athletes			0
after all , we did have @entity78			0
but if tomorrow i had to get in the ring and you gave me a list of 10,000 wrestlers to choose from , i 'm absolutely , positively picking the guy named @entity74			2
unless there 's a @entity85			2
in which case , i choose him			0
now , as i remember it -- and this was a long time ago -- unless it was a pay - per - view mega-event , the big name superstar wrestlers always just faced some random mullet - man in a pair of briefs			0
because , let 's be honest , @entity94 does n't get pinned by the night manager at @entity97			1
apparently , there 's an actual term for these no - name wrestlers			1
they 're called " jobbers			0
" their job is to lose the match			0
@entity74 , it turns out , made a nice career out of getting his brains beat in			0
though i 'm sure mr. and mrs. @entity111 were never pleased with their son 's life choice			0
" you 're such a smart boy , @entity115			2
you could 've been a doctor ! " by the mid- ' 90s it seemed as though @entity31 ( then , @entity31 ) started using fewer of these jobbers in favor of marquee fights to increase their tv ratings			2
it was 1993 when @entity33 first appeared on television			0
almost 20 years later , they 've done it 997 times			0
so , there 's a big milestone coming up			0
to celebrate the upcoming 1,000th episode , @entity31 has been sending @entity129 " @entity132 " @entity130 into the ring each week to compete against past @entity31 legends			1
this week , they brought back @entity7			1
@entity7 lost the match within minutes , and most people online seemed to think it was a rather lackluster performance			2
alas , on this warm summer night , an old , sad clown was just doing his " job			0
" and perhaps somewhere a @entity97 's was missing its night manager .			1

" @entity147 " is our *skewed* look at trending *social* - media topics
this week , @entity149 figures out why " @entity7 " was trending on @entity6
@entity7 's @entity31 *highlights* *include* beating guys named " @entity115 " with a prosthetic limb
even with a loss , at least @entity7 was n't stuck on the night shift at @entity97
