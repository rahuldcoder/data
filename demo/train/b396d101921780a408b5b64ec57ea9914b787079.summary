-- @entity1 kicked up a firestorm with her letter last week to the editor of @entity5 urging female students to find a man to marry before they graduate because " the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry , and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you			1
" if only the @entity19 alum 's advice had come out 30 years earlier when i was in college , perhaps i could have avoided the costly mistake of focusing on what makes me come alive and then pursuing it for a living			1
perhaps if i 'd focused instead on nailing down a man by the time i was 22 , i could be going to cocktail parties and co-opting my husband and children 's successes , bragging about them as if they were my own , rather than being forced to talk about the current state of politics or what we can do as a society to engage the next generation in the struggles of today			2
perhaps , if i 'd had ms. @entity1 's wisdom and foresight about what really matters in college , i would n't have taken so many pesky classes , and instead concentrated on designing my hair , makeup , attire and personality to create the perfect man - catching machine			1
perhaps it would have all worked out exactly as ms. @entity1 implies -- the perfect house , kids , husband and future			1
and yet i 'm skeptical			0
i made a lot of stupid decisions in college ; i 'm really glad the choice of life partner was n't one of them			0
how many people , do you think , could choose a tattoo at 22 years old and still be happy with it by the time they are 50 ? let 's be generous here : maybe a quarter of all people ? and tattoos do n't even talk			0
choosing a life partner requires a maturity and self - awareness that i ca n't imagine more than a small fraction of college students have			2
i know i did n't			0
not only that , but people change			0
who you are at 22 is not who you will be at 35 , and in my experience , the decade following college is the interval where the rate of change is the greatest			0
so while it may be tempting to imagine the white picket fence and 2.5 children i could have had with my hastily chosen college boyfriend , i ca n't help but think a divorce at 28 or 32 would have been more likely , had i chosen that route			0
what then , ms. @entity1 ? i find it refreshing that as the same - sex marriage debate swirls through society , ms. @entity1 remains untouched in her heteronormativity			1
does it even occur to her to question the premise that " the cornerstone " of a woman 's future is finding a husband ? no ! of course not ! it simply must be			0
i have n't heard regressive rhetoric like this since i mistakenly tuned in dr. @entity107 on the radio			0
i have to ask , what are lesbians supposed to do ? must they also find mates while in college , or are lesbians the only privileged group of women allowed to search for self - fulfillment before partnership ? that said , ms. @entity1 really must be commended for what has to be her grasp of satire			1
she knows the stereotype of @entity19 is that it 's filled with self - satisfied , conceited , bloviating jerks , and she captures that tone perfectly to make her point			1
without such bold elitism -- an op - ed that took the perfectly defensible position that college is a target - rich environment free from the awkwardness of bars , set - ups or online dating -- there would have been no stir			0
certainly it would n't have crashed the servers , and the women of @entity19 might have spent another day thinking the future is filled with untold adventure and opportunity , rather than simply another day closer to their expiration date as a desirable partner			1
i applaud ms. @entity1 for her bravery			1
there are n't a lot of well - educated women who would be courageous enough to completely sell out the feminist movement responsible for securing women 's equal social , political and economic rights ( to the degree that we have them ) in favor of the 1950s ' mentality that a woman 's worth is determined by her marital status			2
also , to come out with it while her youngest son remains unmarried ? brave			0
though the " universe of women he can marry is limitless , " the universe of women who would be willing to be her daughter - in - law is finite			2
in all this advice to " the daughters ( she ) never had , " there is one point on which i can not disagree with ms. @entity1 : " it 's amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman 's lack of erudition , if she is exceptionally pretty			1
" perhaps @entity19 should forgo academic requirements for its female students and instead teach " @entity180			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : if only @entity1 had *offered* her man - catching advice earlier
then , says @entity183 , she might have chosen to live through a man instead of her own goals
she says @entity190 successfully satirized the @entity19 stereotype with her retro advice
@entity183 : maybe @entity190 thinks @entity19 women should be taught how to be pretty ?
