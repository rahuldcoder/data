-- it might not be the term that @entity4 leaders prefer , but sen. @entity5 had a choice word about the @entity4 's brand : it " sucks			1
" while in @entity9 on wednesday spreading his message about building a more inclusive party , @entity5 -- as he has many times before -- acknowledged that @entity4 need to collectively improve their image			1
" remember @entity15 ? they admitted , ' hey , our pizza crust sucks			0
' the @entity4 brand sucks and so people do n't want to be a @entity4 and for 80 years , african - americans have had nothing to do with @entity4 , " the @entity19 @entity4 said , according to @entity20			1
his comments came in remarks at a @entity4 field office in a predominantly black neighborhood in @entity29			2
the @entity15 's analogy is a staple in his speeches about broadening the party 's appeal , but he has n't been quite as candid in his use of language			0
earlier this month , @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity37 that " the biggest mistake " republicans have made in the past several decades is not aggressively courting @entity41 votes			2
it 's a message he 's been carrying for the past year as he lays the groundwork for a likely presidential campaign			0
he told @entity45 recently he thinks @entity4 can win a third or more of the @entity41 - @entity41 vote in 2016 if the party embraces his method of advocating for education and criminal justice reform among other efforts to address poverty and unemployment			1
" we 're also fighting 40 years of us doing a crappy job , of @entity4 not trying at all for 40 years , so it 's a lot of overcoming , " he said wednesday			2
" you got to show up , you got to have something to say and really we just have to emphasize that we 're trying to do something different			0
" following @entity62 's 2012 presidential loss , in which he carried only 6 % of the black vote , the @entity60 has also attempted to retool its outreach by opening up multiple offices in urban areas and hiring more staff specifically tasked with targeting @entity41 voters .			0

@entity5 says the @entity4 's brand " sucks "
he says the party makes african - americans feel *unwelcome*
