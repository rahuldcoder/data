@entity0 -- @entity2 shares pictures of some of his most cherished memories : the first time he saw the beach , a @entity8 race and a party from his childhood when all his friends dressed as clowns			1
and yet he has lived the last 43 years -- almost his entire life -- in @entity16 's biggest hospital			1
as an infant , he contracted polio and was left paralyzed from the waist down			1
he breathes with the help of a respirator			2
it was the 1970s , before vaccines eradicated polio in @entity16 , and @entity2 was sent to live in the polio ward with eight other children			1
" it was a wonderful time			2
i 'll never forget it , " he said during a recent interview from his hospital bed			1
" even though most of our friends are no longer with us , i never stopped dreaming about them			2
" his mother died two days after he was born and the rest of @entity2 's family soon stopped visiting			1
he points to a black and white picture of a boy in a pointy hat and clown makeup curled up in a wheelchair			2
" that 's @entity44 , " he says			2
" back then , it was him and me , we were very close			2
" over the years many of the children died , including @entity44			1
" it was december 26 , the day after @entity50 , " he says			2
" everything that i planned with my friend , life did n't have the same meaning			2
but it made me stronger			0
" the children were given little chance of surviving past the age of 10 , but two people did : @entity2 and his lifelong friend and roommate @entity59			1
they still live together in a room tucked inside the @entity63 of @entity0 's @entity64			1
" we 're like brother and sister and we look after each other , " @entity2 says			1
@entity59 suffered paralysis caused by polio when she was a baby			1
she has lived in the hospital for 38 years			1
" i 've been here since i was 1 year and 9 months old , " she tells us			0
" i learned to write , to paint , to use a cell phone , a computer , things i like			0
" they were both encouraged to push beyond their physical limitations			0
more polio cases confirmed in @entity82 , @entity80 says @entity59 recently wrote a book about her experience growing up in the hospital			1
she also discovered painting , patiently dabbing at the canvas with a brush taped to a tongue depressor			0
the wear and tear on her teeth meant she had to limit herself but she has n't stopped			0
@entity2 trained as a computer animator and wrote a screenplay for an animated series			1
with the help of crowd - funding and a group of animators , the series is coming to life			0
" they 're inspirational , " says dr. @entity102 , a physician who has worked in the @entity63 since 1988			0
he says that when they have patients who have been paralyzed in car accidents they take them to spend some time with @entity2 and @entity108			1
" they 're examples to show it is n't the @entity111 , " he says			0
still , they both wish they could visit , or even live , in the outside world			0
" when i turned 10 , the hospital tried to convince my relatives to take me in , " says @entity2			1
" but that 's not what happened			0
" @entity2 's biggest passions are movies and videogames , opportunities to escape his own world			1
" i like to live outside my reality , " he says			0
" to get out of reality i play games , because in the games i can go where i want without suffering any pain			0
" there was a decade of freedom when @entity2 used an electric wheelchair to come and go with relative ease			1
but then post-polio syndrome set in , causing gradual weakening in muscles that were affected by the original infection			0
it became impossible for him to straighten his legs enough to sit in a wheelchair -- so travel is now only done lying down in hospital beds			2
but that has n't stopped him			0
on one of our visits he invites us to join him on an outing to a big videogame convention			0
moving around is complicated -- he travels in an ambulance with medical technicians paid for by donations			0
another complication : the respirator			0
@entity2 does n't need it 24 hours , but he feels more secure , having it just in case			2
but once inside the videogame convention , we enter @entity2 's world			2
he laughs with excitement as a group of medical technicians and friends roll him around on a mobile hospital bed			1
then he tries his hand at a few games			0
" you do n't pay attention to anything else around you , " he says			0
" it 's great , you just want to discover more			0
" for a day , at least , the tubes , the respirator , the hospital bed , they all fade into the background , and @entity2 becomes invincible .			1
