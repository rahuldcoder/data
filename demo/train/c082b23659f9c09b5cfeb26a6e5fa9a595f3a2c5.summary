-- six @entity3 leaders in @entity4 were seized and imprisoned this week , the religious group said			1
the act prompted condemnation and concern from the movement and a top @entity10 religious freedom panel			1
a @entity10 panel says attacks on @entity4 's @entity3 have increased since @entity13 became president			1
@entity4 intelligence agents searched the homes of the six on wednesday and then whisked them away , according to the @entity3 's @entity18			2
the report said the six are in @entity21 and that the arrests follow the detention in march of another @entity3 leader			0
the @entity25 could not immediately be reached for comment , and the incident has not been mentioned in @entity4 's state - run media			1
" their only crime is their practice of the @entity3 faith , " said @entity29 , the principal representative of the @entity3 international community to the @entity31			1
the @entity36 issued a statement friday " strongly " condeming the arrests , which it said were " a clear violation of the @entity4 regime 's international commitments and obligations to respect international religious freedom norms			1
" we urge the authorities to release all @entity3 currently in detention and cease their ongoing harassment of the @entity4 @entity3 community , " the @entity10 statement said			2
the group -- regarded as the largest non-muslim religious minority in @entity4 -- says the arrests are reminiscent of roundups and killings of @entity3 that took place in @entity4 two decades ago			2
" especially disturbing is how this latest sweep recalls the wholesale arrest or abduction of the members of two national @entity4 @entity3 governing councils in the early 1980s -- which led to the disappearance or execution of 17 individuals , " @entity29 said			0
" the early morning raids on the homes of these prominent @entity3 were well - coordinated , and it is clear they represent a high - level effort to strike again at the @entity3 and to intimidate the @entity4 @entity3 community at large , " she added			1
the @entity68 -- a government panel that advises the president and @entity70 -- condemned the wednesday arrests , as well as another in march			2
the commission chairman called the acts the " latest sign of the rapidly deteriorating status of religious freedom and other human rights in @entity4			1
" the commission said the seven were members of an informal @entity3 group that tended to the needs of the community after the @entity4 government banned all formal @entity3 activity in 1983			1
the commission chairman , @entity87 , echoed the fears that the " development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in @entity4 in the 1980s when @entity3 were routinely arrested , imprisoned , and executed			2
" the @entity3 are regarded as " apostates " in @entity4 and have been persecuted there for years			0
" since 1979 , @entity4 authorities have killed more than 200 @entity3 leaders , thousands have been arrested and imprisoned , and more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs , " the commission said			1
the commission said that since president @entity13 came to power a few years ago , @entity3 " have been harassed , physically attacked , arrested , and imprisoned			0
" " during the past year , young @entity3 schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools increasingly have been attacked , vilified , pressured to convert to @entity102 , and in some cases , expelled on account of their religion			0
" the commission said other groups in the predominantly @entity111 country of @entity4 , such @entity107 and @entity108 , are subject to intimidation and harassment			0
@entity13 's inflammatory statements about @entity119 have " created a climate of fear " among the country 's @entity116			0
the @entity3 say they have 5 million members across the globe , and about 300,000 in @entity4			0
the @entity3 say their faith " is the youngest of the world 's independent religions " and that its basic theme is that " humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society			0
" they say their founder , @entity131 ( 1817 - 1892 ) , is regarded by @entity3 as " the most recent in the line of messengers of @entity134 that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			0
