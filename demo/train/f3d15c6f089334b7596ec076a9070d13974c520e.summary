with a long - held ethos of non-interference in other countries ' affairs , risk - averse @entity0 is perhaps an unlikely ally in president @entity7 's pledge to " degrade " and " destroy " @entity8 in @entity9 and @entity10			1
but with @entity13 's growing unease about terrorist threats by @entity16 extremists at home , analysts say @entity0 -- a @entity19 permanent member - is unlikely to oppose plans to build a " broad coalition " to go after @entity8			1
" i think @entity0 in principle will quietly support this idea to curb @entity8 , " says @entity22 , an assistant professor of government at the @entity24			1
" @entity8 has openly listed @entity0 as a major threat to them and if they gain more influence , it 's likely they will target @entity30 and even other parts of @entity0 , " he added			1
earlier this month , @entity9 news reports showed pictures of what they said was a captured @entity0 national fighting for @entity8			2
@entity0 's foreign ministry said it could not confirm the reports			1
many domestic observers assumed the man was @entity41 , a mainly @entity43 minority group that lives in @entity30 , an ethnically divided region in @entity0 's north west			2
it remains unclear whether the captured man was actually uyghur , but @entity47 , a professor of political science at @entity49 , says that there is " deep concern " among security analysts and commentators			0
" if these groups have cells in @entity30 , if it can be confirmed that @entity8 members were recruited from @entity0 , if we are already becoming a ground for recruitment for these people then @entity0 has a stake in keeping @entity8 away from its borders , " said @entity47			0
while @entity0 , along with @entity63 , has blocked @entity19 action on @entity10 during the three - year civil war , both @entity22 and @entity47 said that @entity0 would likely support a generic resolution that condemns terrorist atrocities and authorizes an international force to target @entity8			1
" this is not going to be a resolution that @entity0 will veto			0
this is not about sovereignty or ( @entity10 president ) @entity74 , " said @entity47			0
in response to a reporter 's question on whether @entity0 would join @entity81 efforts to combat terrorism , @entity75 , @entity0 's foreign ministry spokesperson , said that @entity0 hoped that " with joint efforts of the international community , the countries involved will soon restore stability and order , achieve reconciliation , peace and development			1
" " abiding by the principles of mutual respect and equal cooperation , @entity0 is willing to enhance anti-terrorism communication and cooperation with the international community so as to safeguard international security and stability , " she added			2
criticism the @entity81 has been critical of @entity0 's reluctance to get involved in international security issues given its expanding global interests			1
in august , @entity7 called @entity0 a " free rider " for its reluctance to contribute to international security while importing oil and other resources from places like @entity9			0
@entity0 has sent a special envoy to the @entity108 to help facilitate dialogue between @entity110 and @entity111 but changes to its traditional non-interventionist foreign policy have been limited in scale			0
last week , national security adviser @entity115 made her first visit to @entity0 , reportedly conveying hopes that @entity0 might join an international coalition to collectively combat terrorism			0
but its support is likely to symbolic rather than substantive , says @entity47 with scant chance of @entity0 combat troops on the ground			2
" we 're not really ready to take that leap			0
