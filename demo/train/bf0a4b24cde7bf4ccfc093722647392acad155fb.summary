-- a decision by @entity3 prosecutors to subpoena the @entity5 records of an @entity7 activist , as well as records linked to two @entity5 hashtags , has free speech advocates up in arms , calling the move a violation of the @entity14			1
@entity16 prosecutors demanded that @entity5 hand over information posted on the social media website by user " @entity20 , " whose @entity5 handle is @ @entity23 , as well as information from the user behind @ @entity26 and those who tweeted # @entity28 or # d0xcak3 , according to the document			1
the @entity31 gave @entity0 a copy of the subpoena			2
" there is a constitutional right to write things on the @entity39 , " said @entity34 , an attorney with the @entity31 who is representing the person using the @entity5 handle @entity20			1
" there is a constitutional right to do that anonymously			2
" a @entity44 judge held a private hearing thursday and impounded all documents pertaining to the case , according to @entity34 , who said he could not divulge what happened during the session			1
@entity34 said he had requested that the meeting be open to the public			0
" secret court proceedings , particularly proceedings involving @entity14 issues , are troubling as a matter of both law and democracy , " said @entity52 , executive director for the @entity31 of @entity3 , in a statement			1
@entity16 district attorney spokesman @entity60 said that , since thursday 's court proceeding was not public , prosecutors could not comment on the hearing			1
" we investigate and prosecute criminal acts , " @entity60 said			0
" we have no interest in investigating political speech or political opinions			0
" in the subpoena , which was issued on dec. 14 , prosecutors requested that @entity5 release to them " all available subscriber information , " including ip address logs for the time period between dec. 8 and dec. 13 as part of an " official criminal investigation			1
" those dates coincide with clashes between protesters and police in @entity81 's @entity80			0
dozens of protesters were arrested after refusing to leave the public space after being ordered to do so by @entity81 's mayor , @entity84			0
@entity60 would not elaborate on the nature of the criminal investigation , but said thursday that " no charges have been brought against any individual			0
" prosecutors had requested that @entity5 keep the subpoena confidential , but it was posted online last week and has been viewed by more than 20,000 people , @entity34 said			1
subpoenaing @entity5 records is becoming more common , according to lawyer @entity93 , of the @entity95 law firm in @entity96			1
@entity93 , who specializes in intellectual property litigation , said the practice could have " a chilling effect on free speech			0
" " we are in this information - accessible age where we can post anything and everything from anywhere on any device , " @entity93 said			0
" because it 's so easy i do n't think that people put the thought into how this might affect them personally , professionally or legally			0
" @entity111 of @entity112 , an intellectual property law firm in @entity113 , said the most troubling part of the case is that prosecutors are subpoenaing hashtags , meaning that anyone who tweeted or @entity119 or # d0xcak3 could be exposed during the investigation			2
" it looks like authorities are trying to build lists of protestors by using hashtag information , as opposed to going after actual criminals -- which would have been the proper focus of such an investigation , " @entity111 said			0
@entity34 called the subpoena " wildly over-broad , " pointing out that requesting records of two @entity5 handles -- @ @entity23 and @ @entity26 -- could affect thousands			1
" that 's not just subscriber information for those accounts , but presumably followers , " he said			0
@entity5 did not respond to requests for comment			2
a posting on its website says : " we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law , regulation or legal request ; to protect the safety of any person ; to address fraud , security or technical issues ; or to protect @entity5 's rights or property			2
