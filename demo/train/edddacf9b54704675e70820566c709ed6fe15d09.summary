-- he was loved and admired all over the world for helping to end apartheid and heal the scars of a divided nation			0
but in his fight for total freedom , the liberation leader also devoted himself to another cause -- the empowerment of women			0
here are five things @entity13 did to advance female equality in his quest for justice			2
gender agenda although @entity13 made tremendous strides in his battle to bring down apartheid , he recognized early on in his presidency that no major success was possible without gender equality			1
at the opening of the first parliament in 1994 , president @entity13 declared , " freedom can not be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression ... our endeavors must be about the liberation of the woman , the emancipation of the man and the liberty of the child			1
" with the representation of women in @entity42 's parliament jumping tenfold from 2.7 % during apartheid to 27 % after the first democratic elections of 1994 , @entity13 took action by appointing over a third of women to his cabinet			1
and today , females make up 44 % of the country 's politicians -- not far off from the government 's goal to reach " @entity54 " by 2015			0
one of the most prominent appointments was @entity56 as the @entity57			0
she secured this position throughout his presidency as well as the first term of president @entity62			0
women of anti-apartheid era in his celebrated autobiography " @entity65 , " @entity13 acknowledged men were n't alone in the anti-apartheid movement			1
in fact , the @entity68 played a critical role			0
one of the most memorable moments came on august 9 , 1956 , when 20,000 women marched to the @entity73 in @entity74 to protest legislation requiring black women to carry passes in urban areas			1
" the women were courageous , persistent , enthusiastic , indefatigable and their protest against passes set a standard for anti-government protest that was never equalled , " @entity13 wrote in his book			1
almost 40 years after the protest , in 1994 , he honored those women by declaring august 9 @entity86 , a national holiday			1
constitutional justice for @entity13 , democracy and gender equality were far from separate issues			2
in 1995 , at the time of drafting @entity42 's constitution , he said , " as a tribute to the legions of women who navigated the path of fighting for justice before us , we ought to imprint in the supreme law of the land , firm principles upholding the rights of women			1
on @entity104 in december 1996 , @entity13 signed the final draft of the country 's constitution granting @entity42 's women one of the most comprehensive set of rights in the world			1
@entity42 's @entity113 , states " the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds , including race , gender , sex , pregnancy , marital status , ethnic or social origin , colour , sexual orientation , age , disability , religion , conscience , belief , culture , language and birth			0
" it even called for the establishment of the @entity135 , with the vision to create a " society free from gender oppression and all forms of inequality			0
@entity141 in 1993 , a year before @entity13 became @entity42 's first democratically - elected president , the country signed the @entity144 convention to end all forms of @entity146			1
two years later , the rainbow nation later ratified the treaty while he was in office			0
often referred to as an ' international bill of rights for women ' , the convention set out to end all forms of discrimination against women and still is yet to be ratified by the @entity156			2
speaking up for women in 1996 , @entity13 gave a compelling speech on @entity42 's @entity86 , calling for full equality and an end to sexual violence against women			1
not blind to the challenges ahead , he remarked : " as long as women are bound by poverty and as long as they are looked down upon , human rights will lack substance			2
" " as long as outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a meaningful contribution to society , progress will be slow			0
as long as the nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself , it is doomed to failure			0
" but @entity13 also went beyond rhetoric and took political action to improve the lives of women			2
during his presidency , he introduced free prenatal and postnatal care to mothers in the public health system as well as free health care to children up to the age of six			0
though he was a firm believer in advancing women 's rights , today @entity42 faces many challenges , in terms of violence against women			1
in fact , over the years , @entity13 often expressed his dismay over the struggle to achieve equality for women			2
however , this hurdle did n't stop @entity13 and his third wife @entity202			0
the pair continued to work on this issue after he retired from office			0
and , while the rainbow nation has not yet fully lived up to @entity13 's vision , he will remain an inspiration for all working towards social justice .			1
