-- after moving from @entity2 to @entity3 five years ago , @entity1 started noticing something odd when exiting grocery stores			2
her hands and forearms felt hot , looked red and were swollen			2
after a few errands , she identified the irritant : plastic bags			0
" there are some plastic bags that do it , and there are some that do n't , " @entity1 said			0
" all grocery bags pretty much are bad			0
" she started noticing other irritants , too : she began to have a similar response to fragrances as she had to plastic bags			0
now , when she hugs someone wearing certain perfumes or colognes , her face turns red and swells			0
dermatologist @entity27 says skin reactions to fragrances and perfumes are common , but to have a reaction from finished plastic products like plastic bags is extremely rare , though not undocumented			1
" there are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy , usually when they 're in the raw material state , and the unfinished products , " said @entity27 , co-author of a medical textbook on dermatitis , or inflammation of the skin			1
" but because the chemicals in finished products are bound so tightly , it 's awfully hard for them to penetrate to the skin and set off the allergy			1
" then again , the finished products may not be the real problem			0
a reaction to plastics like @entity1 's may have more to do with residue from the manufacturing process than the plastic itself , says materials science expert @entity57			1
" there are additives to make the plastic bags easier to process that manufacturers are putting on the outside surfaces , " said @entity57 , vice president of materials research at @entity59			1
" that could also be the problem			0
" others may react with redness and swelling to plastic bags , but they do n't necessarily have an allergy			1
a condition called dermographic urticaria , in which the skin becomes inflamed from scratching or rubbing , is far more common , @entity27 explains			1
for those with the condition , carrying heavy bags from the grocery store could be enough to cause a reaction			2
@entity1 , however , has developed allergies to some chemicals in plastics and perfumes , her doctor tells her , as well as to seasonal allergens like pollen			1
her doctor explained that allergies to just about anything can develop at any time			2
" i do n't understand how it just comes out of nowhere , because i never , never had issues , " @entity1 said			0
she wonders whether things could just as suddenly get even worse for her or for people she knows			0
it 's a notion she 's confronted with not just in her personal life but also at work , in the catered food she arranges for groups of children and preteens at big events			1
despite being 28 years old , @entity1 has worked in the food and beverage industry long enough to see a dramatic increase in the number of children with food sensitivities , she says			1
she wonders whether people are generally becoming more sensitive to things			0
" it 's amazing how many allergies these kids have			2
we 're preparing more special meals than regular meals			0
which is weird , because then when you do adult functions , you maybe have like one or two allergies			2
the chefs are becoming very well - versed in this now			0
" @entity1 's observations have some backing in peer - reviewed medical studies			0
the latest numbers -- now two years old -- draw from 40,000 children in the @entity127 and reveal that 8 % of those under the age of 18 have food allergies			1
that 's twice the number estimated by the @entity132 , using data collected in 2007			1
dr. @entity134 , who led the study finding the 8 % figure , says that 's probably a conservative number , in part because her team discounted reports by parents when the symptoms sounded more like a food intolerance , such as to gluten or lactose , than a true food allergy			1
although @entity134 and the @entity132 used parent surveys to make their estimates , hospital records show a similar upward trend			1
@entity127 hospitals discharged about 4,135 children with diagnosed food allergies each year between 2001 and 2003			1
for the period from 2004 to 2006 , that average annual number jumped to 9,537 , according to the @entity132			1
" food allergy among children in the @entity127 is becoming more common over time , " states the @entity132 website			1
whether food intolerance to lactose and gluten is also increasing is harder to determine , in part because the conditions often go undiagnosed			2
as the medical community grapples to understand the problem and what can be done about it , businesses have had to adapt and accommodate			0
" it 's a matter of life and death , especially with children			2
six or seven years ago , you 'd just say , ' sorry , that risk is too much to take			0
i ( would ) suggest they bring something with them , or they do n't come , ' " said @entity174 , president of the @entity175			0
" now , today , it 's a standard way of doing business			0
entire menus are designed around that			0

" there are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy , " dr. @entity27 says
reaction to plastics may have more to do with leftover residue from the manufacturing process
