@entity0 -- the cast and directors of the upcoming " captain america : the winter soldier " appeared this weekend at @entity5 in @entity0 to preview the film and reveal new footage			1
the movie , scheduled for release on april 4 , was directed by brothers @entity11 and @entity13 and is meant to bridge the gap between " @entity15 " and its 2015 sequel			2
the footage screened to fans in @entity19 reveals the superhero adjusting the modern world and presents @entity4 with some new and dangerous challenges compared with the original " @entity4 " film , which was set in the 1940s			1
" the movie is very different in tone from the first one , " @entity13 said during a news conference after the panel			0
" the first 's one is kind of a love letter to the captain of that time period			0
the captain is now in the modern world and the film is a political thriller			1
in order to be germane to that tone , we wanted the movie to be modern and edgy and aggressive			2
" you ca n't have thrills in the thriller unless the characters are in a real state of jeopardy			0
so captain goes through a lot in this film			2
it 's action - heavy and a very intense movie			0
" the directors wo n't reveal too much of the plot , but there are several new characters			2
@entity57 plays @entity58 , an ally of @entity4 ( @entity59 )			1
details : the @entity15 and their sequels " @entity4 is looking for a friend in the modern world , " @entity63 said			1
" he 's sort of lost			0
" @entity69 , playing a mysterious @entity68 agent , appeared in the footage screened on saturday , and @entity71 was on hand to ( sort of ) discuss her character , agent 13			1
" i ca n't reveal too much about the character , " @entity71 said			1
" i think people have a certain idea of what i 'm meant to be playing , but i think you 'll be surprised at how we use this character			0
compared to other characters i 've done , it was certainly a challenging experience and an exciting experience			0
" the central point of the film seems to be a friendship between @entity4 and @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , who initially joined forces in " @entity15			1
" " the hurdle of @entity4 is that his nature is to put himself last , " @entity59 said			1
" the first @entity4 film is about getting the opportunity to serve , the opportunity to lead , to a soldier			1
i think he 's so determined to do what 's right			0
the conflict with this modern society as opposed to the ' 40s is in the ' 40s , it was easy to say ' the @entity107 are the bad guys			2
' today it 's a little bit harder to know ' who am i serving ? ' " it 's not about doing the right thing , it 's about ' what is the right thing ? ' we get to see captain struggling with that			0
that 's where his relationship with @entity89 comes to fruition			0
she 's someone who has had to compromise her morals and not live in black and white , and i think as a result -- i ca n't say too much -- something happens			0
these two people from different worlds need to rely on each other			0
" ' agents of @entity68 ' debuts pilot @entity130 plays the titular winter soldier , an altered version of his character @entity134 from the first " @entity4 " film			1
here @entity130 is now the villain			0
the actor said the character deals with similar challenges as his foe in dealing with the modern world			1
" in a sense , he 's very similar to ( @entity4 ) , " @entity130 said			1
" he 's another lost man in this new world			2
as we know , the journey for him is then just discovering his own identity and his role in this new world , in his own way			0
