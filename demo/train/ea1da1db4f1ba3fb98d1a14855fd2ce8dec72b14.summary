@entity0 , @entity1 -- variously described as a genius and a maverick , for six decades @entity5 has created beautiful , pioneering design -- a perfect marriage of form and function			1
a true visionary , he says he has designed thousands of objects -- everything from cameras , to tea pots and sunglasses			0
but it is his transport designs that are most famous , bearing his trademark of streamlined forms inspired by nature			1
" nature had hundreds of millions of years to refine their things , we have only stupid 100 years of aerodynamics , " he says			1
" so nature is not better -- there 's only nature			2
our laws are stupid ... they are not ready yet			0
" studying aerodynamics at @entity30 in the late 1940s , @entity5 considered how birds were able to fly and then used those postulations in aircraft design			1
he did the same when it came to designing ships , this time taking inspiration from the sea creatures he had watched while scuba diving			0
a man with the foresight to realize that environmental sustainability would play a key role in future product design , in 1971 he turned his efforts to changing the design of trucks , which he felt were not aerodynamic or eco-friendly			0
" twenty - five or 30 years ago i designed streamline trucks that consume less fuel , " he says			1
" the industry , stupid as they are , they did n't get this message ; they consumed gasoline by the billions ... if they had adopted my thing , the air would be better today			2
" look at the trucks -- they are square and push an enormous amount of air in front of them so they are not aerodynamic			0
" i started with my knowledge of aerodynamics to design streamlined trucks and i 'm world champion at the moment because my latest model is consuming 50 % less fuel without changing the engine , just through the shape			0
" to promote his streamlined design , @entity5 says he plans to take his trucks on tour around the world next year			1
but despite environmentally friendly principals much of @entity5 's work has remained in the conceptual stages -- an inspiration for other designers rather than a commercial product			1
@entity5 believes that engineers and manufacturers these days are too conservative			1
he says the financial crisis is stopping companies taking chances on innovative designs and argues that with all the new technology and materials available , people need to take creative risks			0
" all kinds of transport must be done but better , " he says			2
" we have the knowledge today , we have the technology today , we have the materials today			0
but we do n't have the brains and the companies who should say yes to good ideas			0
" there are too many conservative brains in positions where they should not be conservative			0
they should go ahead to give the youngsters jobs , ideas and freedom to think			2
" now aged 83 , and retaining his flair for the flamboyant and futuristic , the @entity108 designer does n't look like he is planning to slow down anytime soon			1
" i sat yesterday night , all night through , and i designed the most sensational supermarket in the world , " he says			0
" it 's nonstop -- sometimes it 's a simple lamp for the desktop , for the table , and sometimes it 's a high - speed train or super car			2
" he is a professor at several @entity118 universities and , as befits his belief in young people , says he is to begin the world 's first biodesign professorship in @entity0 next year , giving him the chance to share his knowledge and unique outlook with aspiring designers			1
but despite the generation gap , @entity128 has no fear of being left behind when it comes to the latest trends and technologies			0
" i have done everything , but everything changes every five years , " he says			2
" we have new wisdom , new electronics ... ( it 's not that ) i 'm not up - to - date -- i am 20 years ahead , mamma mia ! people need at least 20 years to come up to my level that i have at the moment ! "			1
