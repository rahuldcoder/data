@entity1 , @entity2 it 's on			1
and it even has its own twitter hashtag , # itson			0
after a week of torrid speculation about the future of the @entity2 prime minister @entity9 , a member of his ruling @entity10 says he will seek a motion on tuesday to declare the country 's top job vacant			1
western @entity2 lawmaker @entity15 says @entity2 have stopped listening to @entity9 and if no one 's listening , @entity9 ca n't lead the party			1
if tuesday 's vote is successful , then a call will be made for nominations for the position of prime minister and deputy leader of the @entity10			1
the prime minister however is defiant			1
in a bombshell announcement , @entity9 declared he and foreign minister @entity26 , the deputy leader of @entity9 's party , stand united and will urge the party not to declare their positions vacant			1
@entity26 has been widely tipped to be a possible aspirant for the top job			1
" we are not the @entity35 , " @entity9 told a hastily convened media conference , in a reference to the turmoil between 2010 and 2013 when the then ruling @entity35 ousted two leaders amid unseemly leaks and constant threat of leadership change			2
" we are not going to repeat the chaos and the instability of the @entity35 years , so i have spoken to deputy leader @entity26 and we will stand together in urging the partyroom [ party ] to defeat this particular motion and in so doing , and in defeating this motion , to vote in favor of the stability and the team that the people voted for at the election			2
" @entity9 's insistence that the people elected him has angered some in his party			2
under the @entity57 system to which @entity2 adheres , @entity9 holds the prime ministership by the vote of his colleagues			1
and a growing chorus of them has been rattled by what they see as a series of poor decisions , back flipping on policies , broken promises and the government 's failure to sell an austerity budget widely seen as hitting the poorest harder than the wealthy			0
the bizarre honoring of the @entity74 's husband , prince @entity73 as a @entity75 of @entity2 on @entity76 , the country 's national celebration of its independent identity , was the tipping point			1
but cabinet ministers have been lining up to publicly support the prime minister over the past week			2
those who 've spoken since the leadership challenge was announced , say they will be voting against declaring the top leadership posts vacant			1
untested and critical will be the views of the government 's backbench where the parliamentary revolt started			0
the position of deputy party leader and foreign minister @entity26 remains murky			1
throughout the week , she has declared her support for @entity9			0
however , she has n't declared whether she would be a contender for his job if the position were to be declared open			0
indeed , even when declaring she would vote against the leadership challenge , she did so on technical grounds			2
" i agree with the pm that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as deputy ... there should be support for the current leadership in a spill motion , " she said in a statement			0
there was speculation during the week that @entity26 would stand on a unity ticket with communications minister and former opposition leader @entity112			2
a man with enormous ambition , @entity112 was ousted from the party 's leadership in 2009			0
a climate change believer and supporter of same sex marriage , @entity112 is a hugely popular figure in the so - called " latte sipping " strata of @entity2 society and in particular amongst voters who traditionally vote for the opposition @entity35			0
whilst @entity112 has said he supports @entity9 , he has not ruled out standing for the position in the event of a leadership challenge			1
undoubtedly , the phones will be furiously worked over the weekend			0
both @entity112 and @entity26 will be testing the waters			0
in the meantime , government members will be weighing whether the effort is worth the risk			0
ringing in their ears might be the words of the trade minister @entity136			0
" i think it 's totally unnecessary and it will make us look like a bit of a circus frankly , " he said			0
since federation , @entity2 has experienced six party room coups that have toppled the prime minister			1
if @entity9 's head rolls , he will have been in power for the shortest period of them all .			0
