-- when she was a public health administrator for the state of @entity4 , @entity1 found that her greatest challenge was paying for babies who were born sick			1
" the figure we were working with at that time was about $ 300,000 ... to stabilize a baby for the first 90 days , " said @entity1 , who worked for the state from 1976 - 1991			2
at the same time , she said , it cost just $ 2,000 to ensure pregnant mothers received all the care they needed for a healthy pregnancy and proper delivery			2
the staggering disparity , along with troubling rates of infant mortality in @entity20 , compelled @entity1 , 62 , to find a solution			2
" it occurred to me that one of the things that we could do that would cost hardly anything was to make sure that moms who were at risk ... [ were ] really connected to care , " she said			2
what @entity1 came up with was @entity31			1
since 1988 , the nonprofit organization has been battling high infant - mortality rates by pairing soon - to - be moms with volunteer " sister friends " who provide guidance and support through the pregnancy and first year of the baby 's life			1
of every 1,000 babies born in the @entity20 , at least six ( 6.14 ) do not survive their first year of life , according to the @entity45			1
that gives the @entity20 only the 45th best infant mortality rate in the world , trailing top - ranked @entity49 ( 1.78 deaths per thousand births ) and countries such as @entity53 ( 2.79 ) and the @entity54 ( 4.78 )			2
and @entity60 - @entity20 babies , regardless of the mother 's age , income or educational level , are more than twice as likely to die before the age of 1 than @entity63 babies , according to the @entity20 @entity64			1
it is this at - risk group that the @entity31 primarily targets			1
" by the act of going back and saving what we consider to be our little sisters at risk , we have found out that we 're also saving our own lives , because we need this kind of information and ... support , regardless of where we are on the socioeconomic ladder , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 started the project as an experiment while working for the state in 1988			0
she paired 10 young , pregnant @entity60 - @entity20 women who had little access to financial , educational and emotional support with more experienced black women who had further education and more stable income			1
the idea was to have the pairs work together to ensure positive birth outcomes			2
this became the founding " sisterhood " that has since been replicated thousands of times			0
@entity1 participated in the experiment as a " sister friend " herself			0
but just days after delivery , the baby of her " little sister " died from complications			0
" i used the words infant mortality ... every day of my working career			0
but until i held @entity103 in my arms , i never realized that that meant counting dead babies , " she said			2
" [ that ] was ... enough to really change my life			0
" the experience moved @entity1 to quit her job and work on the @entity31 full time			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity114 since its inception , the @entity31 has welcomed more than 12,000 babies in 94 community chapters in the @entity20 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			1
" we 've been doing this long enough now that you can hear a child -- 20 years old -- say , ' i was born into the @entity31 , ' " @entity1 said			1
" that means more to me than anything that i may have given up , because in return i have received a whole community			0
" @entity1 and veteran chapter leaders train women who step up and create chapters in their own communities			0
together , they identify local partner organizations that provide the support services needed for maternal and child health , such as parenting classes and transportation to doctor appointments			1
the volunteers then help connect their pregnant sisters to those resources			0
" all of us want to see our babies born as healthy as possible to families who are prepared to care for them , " @entity1 said			1
@entity146 , 36 , and her " little sister , " @entity145 , 20 , are part of the group 's newest chapter in @entity151 , @entity152			0
the two were paired together in april , at the end of @entity145 's first trimester			0
@entity146 has played a key role in @entity145 's pregnancy			0
she not only helps make sure @entity145 is eating right and attending her prenatal appointments , but she also helps @entity145 budget her money and find access to affordable , stable housing			1
" i wanted a big sister that [ has ] kids , [ has ] accomplished a lot in life already to teach me things i do n't know , " @entity145 said			0
" i could tell she cares about me			0
" for @entity1 , seeing the difference the @entity31 is making is " magical			1
" " we can do something to help save the world , " she said			0
" all these women prove me right			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity31 website at www.birthingprojectusa.org and see how to help			1

the goal of the mentoring *program* is to *prevent* babies from being born sick
@entity187 came up with the idea while she was a public health administrator
