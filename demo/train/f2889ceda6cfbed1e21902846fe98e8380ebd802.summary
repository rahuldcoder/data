after 15 years of being addicted to drugs , @entity0 was ready to turn his life around , but he soon realized there were others that were still being controlled by addiction			1
having been through the cycle of jail and drugs , starting with marijuana and ending up with heroin , he decided to start his own rehabilitation center in @entity14 , a city just south of @entity16 's capital @entity17			1
now , 18 years later , he is the director of the @entity18 , one of the only non-governmental drug rehabilitation services in the country with locations across in @entity16			1
spreading drug problem " i saw an article about the only drug recovery center in the country at that time , at the government hospital , " explains @entity0			1
" i went over as a volunteer and saw the problem immediately			2
i sat with 22 young people , 21 were heroin addicts			2
" i had never seen that many heroin addicts in one place at one time , and i 'm an old junkie			2
that was the day that all of this began			0
" @entity0 started the foundation in 1996 , alongside his wife @entity38 , who brought in her knowledge from working with non-governmental organizations ( @entity41 )			1
in the mid- 1990s it was difficult for drug addicts to get clean as there were few drug programs and help centers			1
" in 1996 heroin was running wild			0
it had spread so quickly people did not recognize the severity of the problem , " says @entity0			1
" i thought the best way to begin was to start the narcotics anonymous program in @entity16			1
it was already well established worldwide , but nothing was translated			0
so my wife @entity38 translated the alcoholics anonymous book and the narcotics anonymous basic text			2
" educational solutions @entity0 and @entity38 's first program lasted six months , they taught 156 modules over that period , teaching five hours a day and checking on the progress of each individual student			1
" the offering was a complete program , " says @entity0			1
" we had programs that dealt with prevention , intervention , detoxification , and the beginnings of a basic aftercare program			0
we created a school with an above university level of education			0
" it gave them a basic understanding that they had a choice			0
if you 're going to relapse at the end of six months , choose it			0
giving them the choice is what a real program will do			0
" family support however , the pair have come up against some problems , family support being one of them			2
" aftercare is a big problem across the country , " says @entity0			1
the sense of shame prevents some families from being involved in the aftercare programs , which could make a huge difference			2
in addition , the drug problem in the country is growing faster than the foundation can possibly work			1
despite this setback , the @entity18 wo n't quit			0
" i keep going for the same reason i started			0
" i remember a long time ago somebody put their hand out to me when i had no hope and showed me these programs			0
i started with a 12 - step program and they gave without taking anything			2
" that was a very long time ago now and i do it for the same reason			0
i see people who have no hope			0
