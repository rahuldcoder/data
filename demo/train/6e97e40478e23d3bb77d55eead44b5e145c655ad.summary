@entity0 -- the conspicuous absence from public view of @entity5 's presumptive next top leader is adding new uncertainty to the succession plan for the normally secretive @entity9 leadership			1
for ten days , vice president @entity10 has dropped off the radar of state - run domestic news media , which usually meticulously record official activities of senior leaders			1
@entity10 is widely expected to succeed president @entity15 as the head of the ruling @entity17 next month before assuming the presidency early next year in a once - in - a - decade power transition			1
party chiefs jockey for power ahead of leadership jamboree the mystery of what is keeping him out of the spotlight at such a time has provoked growing speculation in a political atmosphere already rife with intrigue following the scandal that brought down the high - profile party official @entity32 earlier this year			2
@entity10 's absence was first noticed september 5 , when he abruptly canceled meetings with visiting @entity35 secretary of state @entity36 , as well as other foreign dignitaries including the @entity40 prime minister , @entity39			1
@entity35 officials said their @entity5 counterparts had blamed a " scheduling conflict " for the cancellation			1
@entity5 officials declined to provide an explanation			1
then @entity47 , a @entity49 newspaper in @entity50 , reported that @entity10 would meet the @entity52 prime minister , @entity51 , on monday and journalists were invited to cover the occasion			2
when @entity1 called the @entity55 to inquire about the event , a displeased official , who declined to be identified , said , " if you do n't see an event listed on our website , then it 's not public and there is no need to call			2
" monday has come and gone -- and @entity10 remains nowhere to be seen , adding fuel to an internet firestorm running on rumors and gossip			2
despite the @entity5 censors ' best efforts to ban discussion of the subject , unsubstantiated theories have proliferated online , with wild plot lines ranging from a car crash to an assassination attempt			2
who are the next generation of @entity5 leaders ? less fantastical are suggestions by some observers and media reports that @entity10 's absence from the public eye is the result of a health problem such as a back injury or a mild stroke			1
rather than deflate the speculation with an official explanation , the @entity5 authorities have so far remained silent			1
a spokesman for the @entity55 , @entity92 , has dodged questions on the subject several days in a row			0
major news websites like @entity96 dug up week - old photos of @entity10 on monday and republished official accounts of his last public appearance on september 1			1
sporting a dark suit and a purple tie , the 59 - year - old leader looked well and was seen addressing students of the @entity104 in @entity0			0
regardless of the cause of his subsequent absence , some analysts say the current frenzied speculation highlights the shortcomings of the @entity5 authorities ' stonewalling approach to the subject			1
" in most countries including in @entity121 , people are entitled to know the health of their leaders , but in @entity5 this is still regarded as state secrets , " said @entity114 , a longtime @entity5 watcher who teaches politics and history at universities in @entity50 and @entity118			2
" the @entity5 leadership is worried about social stability , " echoed @entity126 , a seasoned @entity5 observer and a professor at @entity128			0
" but nothing creates greater social instability than this kind of lack of information about the leadership			0
" already , @entity5 's leadership transition this year has been marred by extraordinary twists and turns			0
in april , @entity32 , once considered to be among party royalty and a fast - rising star within the party , was stripped of his leadership positions for an unspecified " breach of party discipline			0
" he has not been seen publicly since			0
disgraced party chief looms large over @entity5 's leadership @entity32 's wife , @entity148 , was convicted last month of murdering @entity149 , a @entity150 businessman , and received a suspended death sentence			0
and @entity32 's former police chief , @entity152 , whose attempt in february to seek asylum in a @entity35 @entity155 triggered the scandal , was charged last week with defection and bribe - taking			0
although most analysts agree the all - important 18th @entity161 -- the meeting where a new generation of leaders , headed by @entity10 , is expected to be confirmed -- will be held in the middle of next month , the authorities have not announced the dates for the gathering of some 2,200 party delegates from around the country			1
" more questions are now being asked about the transparency of @entity5 politics since everything is in a black box , " said @entity114			0
observers say the official silence could also signal last - minute negotiations among senior political figures before they present a facade of unity to the public			0
the current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining a united front since 1989 , when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with pro-democracy protests in @entity0 's @entity188			0
" @entity10 is already projected to be a weak leader because he does n't have a power base of his own , " said @entity114 , who predicted @entity15 will remain the head of the @entity5 military for two to three years after relinquishing his party and state titles to @entity10 " @entity15 could be the ultimate winner here -- he will be the power behind the throne			1

@entity10 has n't been seen in public for more than a week and speculation is growing
he is expected to succeed president @entity15 to become the next president of @entity5
his absence , including missing a meeting with @entity36 , has stoked rumors
@entity5 officials declined to give an explanation and refuse to discuss the matter
