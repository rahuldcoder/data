@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is taking a page from @entity5 's counterinsurgency playbook in trying to win the hearts and the minds of those who might otherwise join @entity10 militants or @entity0 nationalists against its military			1
@entity0 province -- @entity1 's largest and one of its most troubled -- is home to a nationalist insurgency and an increasingly violent @entity10 presence			1
the sight of @entity21 troops marching in the @entity1 army might have been unimaginable three years ago , but recruits are now training to fight for the army , not against it			1
more than 3,500 such troops have been recruited since 2007 , commanders say			0
" the whole exercise is to integrate the @entity21 youth , " said gen. @entity27 , a @entity1 army spokesman			1
" if you encourage people all over the province to join the army and the state system ... that is going to diffuse whatever insurgency is left in these parts			1
" part of that encouragement includes education			2
at an army engineering school , free courses are given to hundreds of civilian students			2
the coursework includes time in a computer , filling an education gap the government ca n't			0
" we are established since the inception of @entity1 and we have more expertise and variety here , " said @entity47			0
the army also has made inroads by opening schools			2
when earthquakes hit the province two years ago , the army rushed in to help , but then stayed and boosted their popularity with a rebuilding program in the absence of government reconstruction			1
the army said its soldiers gave up a day 's pay , more than a million dollars , to build a school			1
the sum of their efforts have built 25 schools , 12 mosques and four health clinics			0
after nearly a quarter century , the army has reopened mines that were closed , while warring tribes fought because the central government was keeping the profits			2
the alienation led to calls for independence -- the @entity0 nationalist movement			2
with the mines open , $ 75 million dollars worth of coal has been extracted so far , with $ 16 billion dollars worth still underground			0
" it is being spent overwhelmingly -- over 80 to 90 percent -- on the area itself , " for residents , for the children and for future generations , said @entity27			0
but siding with the military can come at a cost			0
tribal leader @entity93 said he 's been attacked 18 times for supporting the army			1
he blames other tribal chiefs			0
" if you want schools , you get shot , " he said			0
" they say we do n't need health centers and roads			0
" while the counterinsurgency is making progress , the military acknowledges that it will take many more years of its best efforts to turn the tide and make the @entity10 and nationalist ambitions a thing of the past .			1
