author @entity0 hopes you like his new book , but if not , an apology is built right into the title			1
" @entity9 " is his new collection of mind - bending , moving and sometimes melancholy stories arriving in bookstores july 24			1
@entity0 's 2010 novel , " how to live safely in a @entity11 , " was named one of the best books of the year by @entity13			1
it dealt with a fictional version of the author , another @entity0 , a lonely time machine repairman stuck in a time loop			1
in his new book , @entity0 returns to skewer more science fiction concepts , including the multiverse , time travel , video games and zombies			1
while he pokes fun at pop culture , @entity0 also finds the human moments in what he often portrays as an increasingly isolated and sterile existence			1
@entity0 's quirky mix of science fiction and social commentary has attracted a loyal following among discerning readers and critics			1
he has been favorably compared to writers like @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
when he 's not writing , @entity0 is a lawyer living in @entity38 with his wife and their two children			1
@entity42 recently interviewed @entity0 by e-mail			1
the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity42 : where did the title come from ? yu : the title comes from the last story in the book			2
it was originally a piece that i actually wrote onto a cocktail napkin , as part of @entity56 's @entity55 , and which i expanded for the collection			1
a lot of the stories in the book are about different universes , some big , some small , some of which already exist today , and some of which are not hard to imagine in the near future			2
these are artificial environments created or enabled through technology , and i was interested in how people communicate , in these environments , about how people talk to each other , about what limitations there are in language as a medium to express our desires , how technology might remove some of those limitations , but create new ones we 've never had before			2
" @entity81 " seemed appropriate as a title , being words for concepts that , if not universal , are found in a great many languages and cultures			1
see the story @entity0 wrote on a cocktail napkin that inspired his latest book @entity42 : was this book any harder or easier to write than your last ? yu : it was harder			1
this is my third book , and each one has been harder than the last			2
i 'm not sure i like the way this trend is going			2
... @entity42 : where do you find your ideas and inspiration ? yu : i go looking for them in a bunch of places , and they 're never where they are supposed to be			2
so i take a break , sit down , gaze off into some corner of the room , and there it is : an idea			2
the problem is , the next time i will start by looking in that same corner , and of course there 's nothing there anymore			1
so i start the process over again			2
@entity42 : do you think multiple universes exist and are there alternate @entity124 out there ? yu : i 've been fascinated by the idea of a multiverse ever since i first learned of it , from my alternate self			2
ok , no , not from my alternate self			0
from a book by @entity131 , who i have raved about elsewhere			0
and now , i 'm fascinated to be reading about all of these other speculative hypotheses about different kinds of multiverses			0
it 's a really mind - scrambling idea , the kind of idea that , once it 's in your head , it 's hard to remember what it was like before you 'd ever been exposed to it			1
i personally hope there are no alternate universes ( except in the sense that @entity131 uses the term ) , though			0
this one is strange enough , and if it turns out to be the only one , that would make it even more mysterious			0
@entity42 : the future you write about often feels sad and lonely			0
with that in mind , do you think new technology is making us more isolated ? yu : with , say , social media , in the short term , i think it 's a multiplier and an aggregator and an accelerator			1
it does n't change who we are , it just enables us to say things faster , and to more people -- but at some point that quantitative effect shades into a qualitative change in how we relate to each other			0
and some aspects of social media make us more connected			0
but other aspects reduce the need , and to some extent , desire , to talk to people face - to - face , and it 's easy to understand how those aspects might be making some people feel more lonely than ever			1
but social media is just one part of technology			0
there are so many other incredible things being developed now			0
for instance , i watched that video a few weeks ago , of the woman , a quadriplegic woman , who moved a robotic arm with her mind			0
so that she could take a sip of her drink			0
the look on her face as she did it ( and the look on the face of the researcher who was with her ) -- it was unbelievable and moving and i could not stop watching it , over and over again			0
here is a person who is , in some ways , more isolated than anyone -- her desire , her will to move is trapped inside of her unmovable body			0
and technology and human ingenuity has brought her will back into the world , reconnected her with the objects and people around her			0
@entity42 : you 've been described as a science - fiction writer and compared to writers like @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
what do you think of these labels and comparisons ? yu : those are all ludicrous comparisons			0
and i welcome them wholeheartedly			0
but seriously , the three writers you just named are on the very top shelf of my personal pantheon , along with a few others			0
i go back to them over and over again for inspiration and , of course , to steal whatever i can from them			0
as for the label science - fiction writer -- i 'll take it , and wear that label with pride			0
but there 's plenty of room on my shirt for other labels , too			1
@entity42 : what does your family think of your writing ? yu : they 're very supportive			0
and my daughter , who is 4 , is starting to tell people that her dad is a " book writer " which makes me feel the strangest kind of pride , for some reason			0
i think it 's the way she says it -- matter of fact , like , you 're dad 's a fireman ? oh , that 's cool , mine is a book writer			1
