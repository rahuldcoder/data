-- after deliberating for nearly two hours , a @entity2 jury found 18 - year - old @entity4 guilty friday of multiple charges , including felony murder , for shooting and killing 13 - month - old @entity8 during a robbery			1
@entity4 was also convicted of aggravated assault and other charges for shooting pastor @entity12 during a separate mugging 10 days before the baby was shot			1
his mother @entity14 , who was tried along with her son , was convicted of tampering with evidence for her role in trying to cover up the shooting			1
both @entity4 and his mother showed no sign of any emotion as the verdict was read			1
they sat silently , staring straight ahead as they have throughout the entire trial			1
@entity4 could be sentenced to life in prison for his convictions			1
he was spared from the death penalty , because he was 17 when the baby was shot			2
a @entity2 law prohibits anyone who is under 18 years old at the time of involvement in a crime from being executed			1
@entity37 ' mother could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for her conviction			1
@entity40 , @entity8 's mother , wept on the stand during the trial as she recounted how @entity4 shot her son in broad daylight in @entity44 , @entity2 , on march 21 , after he and another teen tried to mug her			1
" i told him i have a baby and i have expenses and i did n't have ( money )			2
he asked me if i wanted him to shoot my baby			2
i told him , ' please do n't shoot my baby			2
' he shot a warning shot into the ground , " @entity50 said , weeping			2
" i asked him , ' why are you doing this ? please do n't do this			2
' it felt like he shot me in the ear			2
then he shot me in the leg			2
" @entity50 said one of the teens then did the unthinkable -- he aimed for the baby			0
" i tried to stop him			0
i put my arms over my baby but he still shot him , " she said			0
" he walked over and shot my baby			0
" during his closing argument friday , @entity4 ' attorney @entity66 attacked @entity50 's recollection of the shooting , saying she could n't confidently identify @entity4 as the shooter			1
he also accused her of plotting her baby 's death to profit from a life insurance policy			1
" @entity40 is a woman who was very distraught , who was very emotional			0
but also who acted in a rather bizarre way			0
you saw the video of where she is laughing and cutting up with officers , and making jokes with them just after her child was murdered , " @entity66 said			0
" incidentally , does anybody know what the protocol is for how you are supposed to act when you watch your child get shot in the face , " prosecutor @entity83 said during her closing argument			0
@entity83 called the defense 's accusation that @entity50 planned her baby 's death a " grand conspiracy " and an attempt to distract from the reality that his client is guilty			1
" we have a defendant who preyed upon the weak			0
he preyed upon the weak when he was looking for @entity100 to rob , because he knows lots of times they ca n't speak @entity104			0
they might be here illegally			0
they may not even report to police , " said @entity83			0
" they do n't see any more @entity100 that morning			0
they see something even better , something even more weak , something even more vulnerable , a mother and a child			1
" @entity83 ended her closing argument with an emotional plea to the jury to find @entity4 guilty of murder			1
" this case cries out for ( determining ) malice , " @entity83 said			0
the teenager accused of being @entity4 ' accomplice is @entity123 , who was 15 at the time of the shooting			1
although @entity123 is a minor , @entity0 is identifying him because he is charged as an adult , and media outlets have been naming him since his arrest			0
@entity123 has also pleaded not guilty to the multiple charges against him , which include felony murder			1
he will go on trial later , separately from @entity4 , and also faces life in prison			0
@entity123 testified against @entity135 earlier in the trial , identifying him as the shooter .			0
