@entity0 -- @entity4 authorities have moved perhaps hundreds of detainees to military sites to hide them from @entity7 monitors assessing whether the government is upholding a commitment to end its crackdown on protesters , @entity2 said tuesday			1
" @entity4 has shown it will stop at nothing to undermine independent monitoring of its crackdown , " said @entity12 , @entity13 director at @entity2			1
" @entity4 's subterfuge makes it essential for the @entity7 to draw clear lines regarding access to detainees , and be willing to speak out when those lines are crossed			1
" @entity4 foreign minister @entity23 told @entity24 last week that the international monitors could move around the country " under the protection " of the government but would not be permitted to visit sensitive military sites			1
@entity2 said it was told by a @entity4 security officer in @entity31 that his prison director had ordered him to transfer about 400 to 600 detainees from his detention facility to other places			1
" the transfers happened in installments , " the official said , according to @entity2			1
" some detainees were moved in civilian jeeps and some in cargo trucks			0
my role was inside the prison , gathering the detainees and putting them in the cars			0
my orders from the prison director were to move the important detainees out , " the official said , according to @entity2			1
he said that officials told him the detainees were being taken to a military missile factory in @entity54 , outside of @entity31			2
other witnesses corroborated his account , @entity2 said			2
the @entity4 security officer also said the government has issued police identification cards to military officials , according to the human rights group			2
@entity2 said it has a document that appears to be from the @entity63 ordering the transfer of personnel from the @entity66 to the @entity67 , which oversees the police			2
" dressing soldiers in police uniforms does not meet the @entity7 call to withdraw the army , " @entity12 said			2
" @entity7 needs to cut through @entity4 government deception by pushing for full access to anywhere @entity4 is holding detainees			1
" @entity78 , a member of the @entity80 @entity79 , said he is part of the @entity7 mission			2
he said @entity7 secretary - general @entity90 had " emphasized the importance of neutrality , objectivity and transparency of our work " during the fact - finding mission			2

" they saw an opportunity prior to these @entity7 monitors arriving , " he said			2
" we obviously look to these individuals to be intrepid in their search for the truth of what 's happening on the ground , and we would ask , or demand rather , that the @entity4 authorities allow them full access to the @entity4 people in order to carry out their mission			1

the monitors arrived amid what opposition members said was a military siege in recent days against protesters in @entity31 , @entity4 's third - largest city			1
the observatory called the reported withdrawal of government forces a deceptive " show " for the @entity7 monitors			0
it said at least 11 tanks had repositioned themselves inside government centers in the city from where they could return quickly to their previous positions			0
" it shows its ( the @entity227 regime 's ) attempt to circumvent the @entity7 mission in order to give credibility to its false stories and deny the crystal - clear fact that there is a huge political crisis and a ' popular revolution ' , by all the standards , by the @entity4 people who are trying to regain power , freedom and dignity , " the observatory said on its @entity250 page			1
the @entity7 observers " will have access to any place they want , freely , " said a senior official in the league 's advance group			1

the unrest in @entity4 began in march when protesters , emboldened by democracy movements in @entity314 and @entity80 , called for open elections and an increase in political freedoms and demanded an end to brutal regime actions			1
