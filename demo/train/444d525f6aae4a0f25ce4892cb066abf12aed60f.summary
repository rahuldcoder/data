before you dismiss president @entity3 's proposal of two years of free community college as frivolous government spending , let me toss a number out at you : 500 %			1
that 's roughly how much college costs have increased between 1985 and today			1
compare that with wages , which have increased by about 140 % over the same time period and you begin to understand why @entity14 owe $ 1.4 trillion in student loan debt			1
had the rise in college costs stayed in line with the inflation , the $ 10,000 to send your kid to school in 1985 would have been $ 21,947.12 today			1
instead it 's over $ 50,000			2
if college was still a luxury , like say a @entity25 , then sure , dismiss the high price as a personal problem			2
but it 's important to point out that while much of the 2012 presidential debate focused on the economy and job creation , employers were sitting on 3 million unfilled jobs because @entity14 did n't have the skills needed to fill them			1
by 2020 , one third of all new job openings will require some postsecondary education , according to a study conducted by @entity39			1
if you still think a proposal to make community college free is just a liberal handout , then you 're living in the past			1
the reality is bachelor degrees are the high school diplomas of the 21st century			0
and whether you like president @entity3 or not is irrelevant , because the skills gap that has been a drag on our economy is not go away after 2016			1
neither will the postsecondary sticker shock that discourages people from trying to get the skills necessary to be employable in any field beyond those found in the low - paying service industry			2
any @entity59 hopeful who talks about creating jobs at a campaign stop but fails to mention the cost of a college education is just a windbag looking for applause			1
president @entity3 's domestic policy has n't been perfect , but he 's quietly pushed through a number of measures that have made college more affordable			1
for example , his administration doubled the money for @entity73 , capped new loan payments at 10 % of income and expanded education tax credits , providing up to $ 10,000 for four years of college tuition			1
his latest proposal does not address the problem of runaway college costs			1
and it will take a degree of fiscal gymnastics to pay $ 3,800 in tuition for each of the 9 million students the administration is estimating would take advantage of the program			0
but it is a mistake to immediately shoot holes into the k - 14 conversation and allow all the good it could do sink into the abyss of partisan gamesmanship			0
the administration compares the long - reaching impact of free community college with that of the compulsory laws , which made school attendance mandatory , and the progressive era , which made high school more accessible			1
these were seminal moments in this country 's workforce history			2
shifting the thinking around postsecondary education from a luxury to an integral part of citizenship would not only provide financial relief -- especially for families who are too rich to receive traditional aid and too poor to pay out of pocket -- but would keep our workforce competitive			2
it would also help our economy			0
despite the addition of 252,000 new jobs in december and an unemployment rate of 5.6 % , we know there are hundreds of thousands of people who have stopped looking for work because they do not believe there are jobs for them			0
we know there are millions who are working part time involuntarily			0
and we know there are 500,000 unfilled jobs in manufacturing alone -- good paying , full - time work waiting for workers with the right skills			2
it is unlikely the newly christened @entity138 @entity137 will debate , let alone pass what @entity3 is proposing if for no other reason than he 's the one proposing it			1
they will say if the president wants to create jobs he should green light the @entity147 pipeline , as if the 35 permanent jobs projected to come from it will impact the unemployment rate			2
such is life in @entity153 , i guess			0
if we 're lucky , this proposal would open the door to a substantive debate that will unfold as @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and other presidential hopefuls look for ways to differentiate themselves from the pack			0
or maybe common sense would win out			0
by 2025 , 55 % of new jobs in @entity165 will require at least a two - year degree			0
currently , only 32 % of state residents have one			0
in response , gov. @entity169 introduced the " @entity172 " scholarships last year , becoming the first state to make community college free			1
all students need to do is prove they are state residents , maintain a 2.0 gpa and do eight hours of community service per semester			0
@entity169 , a @entity138 , understood that for his state to be competitive with the rest of the country , he had to address the looming skills gap			0
this is the model the president hopes to replicate to keep the country competitive with the rest of the world			0
paying for it will no doubt be a major sticking point for his critics			0
however , skirting this topic altogether will undoubtedly cost us all a lot more .			0

@entity194 : president @entity3 's proposal of two years of free community college is smart
*soaring* college costs take a toll on @entity14 ' education and skills , as well as our job *market*
