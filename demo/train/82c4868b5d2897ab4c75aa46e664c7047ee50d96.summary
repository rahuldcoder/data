-- @entity1 was playing a round of golf with a friend on april 6 , 2001 , when he received news of the kind every parent fears : his 18 - year - old daughter , @entity8 , had been in a car crash			1
" what they did n't tell me is she 'd been dead an hour , " said @entity1 of @entity10 , @entity11			1
twenty minutes after receiving the call , @entity1 was at the emergency room talking to a grief counselor			1
" a few weeks later , i went to thank the firemen who tried to save her , " he said			2
" they told me she never knew what hit her			0
" @entity1 said he can not begin to imagine the pain that the loved ones of the victims from friday 's @entity26 theater mass shooting are experiencing			1
" it was so violent and there was no reason , no cause for it , " he said			0
" those who lost spouses , siblings , boyfriends and girlfriends -- they 're going to spend the next few years and most of their lives trying to make sense out of something that makes no sense			1
" victims of massacre remembered with poignant stories @entity1 believes that getting bereavement and trauma experts to victims ' families is the best support possible			1
when his daughter died , @entity1 was running his own company , and could take personal time to grieve			1
however , extended time off is not a reality for many @entity54			2
" people have sent me their stories , " @entity1 said			1
" one woman lost a child and her boss showed up at the funeral and said , ' i 'll see you at work on monday			0
' " in january 2011 , @entity1 partnered with another grieving father , @entity63 , to draft a proposed amendment to the @entity65			1
according to the @entity54 @entity71 , the current act " entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid , job - protected leave for specified family and medical reasons			2
" three months of leave is allowed for the birth of a child or to care for a sick family member , among other things			2
yet the death of a loved one is not covered by the act			0
a weekend at grief camp : ' it 's never going to be the same ' " you have 12 weeks off to have a child , " @entity1 said , " but three days off when a child dies			1
it does n't make any sense			1
" in summer 2011 , after receiving letters from @entity90 who had also signed @entity1 's initiative , sen. @entity87 , @entity88 , proposed the @entity93 , which would amend the @entity65 to incorporate extended , job - protected leave for the loss of a child			1
" the senator was struck by it and , like most people , surprised the law was n't already taken care of , " said a spokesman from @entity87 's office			2
" we want to see it pass but we do n't have a lot of time left this year			1
" the average bereavement leave for a person who loses a child is three days , according to dr. @entity111 , a researcher at @entity112 and the founder of the @entity114 , which provides support to grieving families			1
@entity117 has been studying the emotional , social , cognitive , and economic impact of child death on individuals , families and society for almost 20 years			0
" the death of a child is one of the most traumatic experiences a human being can endure , " @entity111 said			0
" i can not express to you how incredibly devastating this is to people			0
" experts like @entity117 explain that without giving parents sufficient time to grieve for their loss , companies and corporations will pay for it in the long run			1
researchers at the @entity141 , a nonprofit foundation , measured how situations like death and divorce affect @entity54 businesses			0
according to @entity148 , executive director of the institute , the current estimated annual loss due to reduced productivity as an aftereffect of grief is around $ 225 billion			0
" when someone we love dies , we lose the ability to concentrate or focus , " @entity148 said			0
" your brain does n't work right when your heart is broken			2
that 's why businesses lose money			0
" three months for bereavement leave is a more realistic standard than three days , according to @entity111			1
after 12 weeks , " people are usually past the stage of being stunned and paralyzed by the loss , " she said			0
" now they can understand what this loss means			0
" while a person can take extra time off for mental health reasons , @entity111 said this creates an ethical dilemma			2
if someone needs to mourn , having to declare depression for time off work is an unnecessary label that could also affect future employment opportunities			2
" grief is not a mental illness			0
it is a normal response , " she said			0
a walk to pound grief into the ground			0

@entity1 has heard from parents who do n't get time to grieve
three days of leave " does n't make any sense , " he says
