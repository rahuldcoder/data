-- flu vaccine myths can confuse people trying to decide whether to get a shot			1
here are five common myths and , based on information from the @entity6 , the truth			2
the shot can give you flu not so , says the @entity6			1
the viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine , which means they can not cause infection			2
the vaccine batches are then tested , with a group of people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or salt water			0
" the only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot , " the @entity6 found			1
" there were no differences in terms of body aches , fever , cough , runny nose or sore throat			0
" still , some people feel bad after a flu shot			2
soreness at the injection site is one reason , but it usually dissipates within two days			0
it 's caused by the immune system making antibodies to the killed viruses in the vaccine that help a person fight off the flu			2
the @entity50 says symptoms , in rare instances , include fever , muscle pain , and discomfort or weakness , which also typically go away after a day or two			0
and , though a flu shot wo n't give you the flu , its protection does n't kick in for two weeks from the time of injection			1
during that time , you are vulnerable			0
in addition , it 's easy to confuse seasonal flu for an illness caused by a number of other pathogens , including rhinovirus			0
or you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the vaccine			2
finally , the flu shot does not always work -- particularly among the elderly and people with weak immune systems			2
but even among these high - risk groups , the vaccine can prevent complications			0
it is better to get the vaccine later in the season to limit the risk that its efficacy will wane no. the shot lasts an entire flu season , except for some children who may need two doses			1
the @entity6 recommends that all people older than 6 months get a flu vaccine			1
the flu shot might adversely affect my pregnancy no. the flu vaccine is " an essential element of prenatal care " and is recommended for all pregnant women , according to the @entity93			1
pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia , infections and dehydration			1
though babies can not be vaccinated until they have reached 6 months of age , antibodies they received in utero from their mothers may help protect them			0
but note that the group recommends against the nasal spray -- the live , attenuated version -- for pregnant women			1
the @entity6 says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies			1
i 've had the flu before and it was no big deal , so bring it on no. seasonal flu exacts a bigger toll in some years than in others : between 1976 and 2007 , the flu was linked to a low of 3,000 to as many as 49,000 fatalities in the @entity122 , with more than 200,000 hospitalizations			0
there are two main reasons : the viruses that circulate in one year may differ from those that circulate in another			0
and , of course , people change from year to year , meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another			0
the flu shot does n't work it does n't work all the time , but it does confer some level of protection			0
for example , the @entity6 says preliminary data for the 2010 - 2011 season show that it was about 60 % effective for all age groups combined , and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to 90 % .			1

the flu vaccine can not give you the flu , according to the @entity6
the shot lasts for an entire season , except for some kids who may need two
the vaccine is essential for pregnant women to protect their infants
