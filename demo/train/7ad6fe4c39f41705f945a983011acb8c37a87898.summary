-- the @entity2 government has announced plans to establish the world 's largest protected marine area in the @entity6			1
the proposed @entity7 will cover 989,842 square kilometers ( around 380,000 square miles ) -- an area roughly one tenth the size of the @entity10 " @entity2 's vast oceans provide a source of food and resources , and are a place of recreation			1
but we can not afford to be complacent , " @entity2 's environment minister @entity17 said			0
" in the space of one lifetime , the world 's oceans have gone from being relatively pristine to being under increasing pressure			2
" the environmental significance of the @entity6 lies in its diverse array of coral reefs , sandy cays , deep sea plains and canyons			2
it contains more than 20 outstanding examples of isolated tropical reefs , sandy cays and islands , " he added			0
the @entity6 is located off @entity2 's northeast coast and stretches from the @entity37 to @entity38 in the north and the @entity40 in the east			1
its shallow reef systems , say the @entity2 government , support tropical ecosystems abundant in hard and soft corals , sponges , algae , fish communities and other creatures such as nautilus and sea stars			1
the largely uninhabited islands also support critical nesting sites for green turtles and a range of seabird species			0
watch @entity57 on @entity0 's @entity58 @entity59 -- a environmental campaign group supported by several conservation organizations -- described the announcement as " a good start , " but said the plans fall short of full protection for coral and marine life			0
" only the eastern half of this ocean treasure has been set aside as a safe haven for marine life			0
the western half contains most of the species - rich coral reefs and critical spawning sites for black marlin and threatened tuna , " @entity72 from the @entity73 said in a statement			1
there now follows a 90 - day public consultation period which the government says will assist in finalizing the proposals .			0
