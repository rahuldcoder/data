" we 're racist , we 're racist , and that 's the way we like it , " chanted a group of @entity3 football fans as they shoved a black man off a @entity6 train			1
again and again the black passenger attempted to board the waiting train , only to be pushed back onto the platform by a torrent of limbs and hateful words			1
the man went home to his wife and three children and , having lost his phone in the melee , was initially unaware the incident had sparked a global debate about racism that spilled far beyond the sports stadium			1
the ugly scene , caught on camera by a horrified onlooker , showed racism is very much alive and kicking -- and it 's not just football 's problem			1
" there 's a strand of male culture you see in the @entity35 , and to some extent other @entity40 societies , prevalent among 20 , 30 and even 40 - year - olds , which is : you go abroad , you drink a fair amount , you sing songs and engage in banter , and pick on someone who is different to you , " said @entity36 , executive director of @entity37 ( @entity37 )			2
" there 's this pervasive sexism and racism			2
the idea that ' anyone who is n't like us , we 're going to sing about them and insult them and it 's part of the lad 's day out			2
' " it 's a culture absent from women 's football			1
" the fastest growing participation sport in the @entity35 , and many countries around the world , is women 's football , " explained lord @entity60 of football equality group , kick it out			2
" and i have to tell you we do n't get such incidents in women 's football			2
or such incidents in disabled people 's football			1
but we get it in men 's football			2
" it 's part of that lad 's culture and the stick - together mentality that goes with it			1
and it does n't just have to be on the issue of race			0
it embodies sexism , homophobia and @entity87			0
" racism and football have a long relationship , says @entity36 , pointing to the strong sense of tribalism within the sport			1
" @entity95 football in particular is rooted in a white , working class community , " he explained			1
" when the country started to experience mass migration from the colonies in the 50s , 60s , and 70s , then the racism that was prevalent on the streets and schools and workplaces , was being amplified inside football stadiums			1
" and then at some point racism in football stadiums was actually more prevalent than in the streets and schools -- it was more consistent , heard more often , and more virulent			2
" @entity37 's " dark days " of racial abuse in 1970s and 1980s are behind well behind us , he says			0
though there is still some way to go in stamping it out completely			0
" even 10 years ago , the chances of an ethnic minority hearing something racially offensive in the football stadium , was commonplace			2
" but now i think there 's an acceptance that a line has been drawn , that it 's not acceptable , and that we revere many black players			0
@entity3 fans themselves voted @entity129 , a black player , as being one of their all - time heroes			1
" strangely enough , the same @entity3 ' fan ' who shoved the black passenger in @entity134 supports a team with some of the most talented black players in the league and which has just signed the talented @entity139 winger @entity138			1
in recent years football has suffered a spate of high - profile racial abuse cases , notably involving @entity143 , who is now at @entity144 and @entity3 captain @entity145			1
while @entity147 's @entity146 was racially abused while playing in @entity149 's @entity148 over the last decade , @entity150 's governing body @entity150 have prosecuted over 120 incidents of racism -- sanctions included player suspensions , matches played behind closed doors , and fines			0
back in @entity35 , the @entity157 created a 92 - point inclusion and @entity159 in 2012 , including confidential hotlines for players to report discrimination , ethnic quotas for referees and coaches , and state - of - the - art cameras to catch racist abuse in the stands			0
following the incident in @entity134 this week , @entity3 has now suspended five people from its home ground @entity173			1
depending on the evidence , they may also be banned from the club for life			0
" in @entity95 , our stadiums are far safer , they 're better stewarded , there are policing operations which are quite sophisticated , " said @entity36			2
" and actually some would argue that it 's gone too far			0
some would argue that those stadiums are quite sterile , that they lack the passion they once did			0
" away from the stadia and away from the @entity6 another kind of prejudice is in action			0
@entity189 estimates that just 3 % of those in professional coaching and management positions are from ethnic minorities			0
" the boardrooms are almost exclusively white and male -- and senior administrative positions are the same way , " said @entity60			0
" we 're seeing some progress , but it 's slow			0
at the start of this season there were no black managers -- now there are five , including one in the premier league			0
" @entity206 boss @entity205 is that one black manager in the @entity208 and he insisted blame for the incident in @entity134 should n't be left at football 's door			1
" i do n't believe they are @entity3 fans or fans of football , " said @entity205			1
" i believe they are acting in a manner which we all think is a thing of the past , " he said			0
" those views are intrinsic in everyday life			0
i 've been saying for a long time these are social issues which manifest themselves in the football world			0
" and as the incident in @entity134 showed , racism in football need n't be confined to the playing field .			1
