-- @entity1 started the 2014 season off slowly , which might have been predicted given he had back surgery last fall			2
he picked up his game at the @entity5 only to suffer a bewildering loss to @entity7 at @entity8 as the defending champion			0
things almost got worse for @entity1 on the opening day of the @entity12 , as he suffered from cramps throughout his body before seeing off @entity16 @entity15 6 - 3 7 - 6 1 - 6 7 - 5 on monday			1
despite @entity1 being in distress , @entity15 could n't serve out the fourth set and also squandered a break chance in the final game when he netted a fairly routine forehand volley			1
for much of the last two sets , @entity1 struggled with his movement , did n't get pace on his serve and clutched at his body			2
@entity15 was " incapable of taking his opportunity , " @entity25 , the coach of world no. 1 @entity26 who was analyzing the match for @entity28 , said			2
" @entity1 was presented to @entity15 on a silver platter in that fourth set but @entity15 did n't like it			1
" @entity1 , known for his endurance , said he began to cramp after an hour and 45 minutes			2
that was n't " normal , " he added			0
" and then i did n't really know what to do in that third set , because my quads were cramping and then i started to get it in my lats so when i was throwing the ball up to serve , and then in my forearms , " @entity1 told @entity28			0
" i did n't know whether to conserve energy or to try and finish it in three sets , but then i got broken at the beginning of the set			0
i just tried to hang around			0
i was trying to play without using my legs much			0
" @entity1 -- taken to five sets by @entity15 in @entity47 in 2011 -- was also left wondering why his body let him down			1
" i need to work out why that happened today because it should n't happen after an hour and 45 minutes regardless of the temperature , " he said			0
" it was hot but it was n't particularly humid and we did n't play loads of long rallies in the first couple of sets , either			0
" if it was only down to cramps , @entity1 could very well make a complete recovery and the 2012 champion caught a break in the draw because his next opponent is @entity66 , not tricky @entity68 @entity67			1
@entity66 upset @entity67 in straight sets			0
in the women 's draw , second - seed and @entity5 finalist @entity70 survived a scare , too , eventually overcoming inexperienced @entity76 @entity75 6 - 7 6 - 1 6 - 2			1
there were victories for fourth - seed @entity79 , sixth - seed @entity81 and 19th - seed @entity82			1
@entity82 , 34 , beat the nearly 44 - year - old @entity83 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3 .			1

@entity1 begins his @entity12 by *toiling* past @entity15 in four sets
2012 champion @entity1 is *hoping* to find his form after *slumping* since july
women 's second - seed @entity70 rallies to beat a *young* @entity76
