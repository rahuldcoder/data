@entity0 -- @entity2 has been a longtime critic of @entity4 military policy and for 17 years has protested around @entity5 in @entity6			1
" it 's completely immoral what 's happening there , " he says			2
" i 'm not the threat " to anyone on the government reservation or its mission			0
" they think what i have to say is the threat			0
" his message of peace and the conflict it has created with @entity22 administration officials have now taken @entity23 and his case all the way to the @entity4 @entity26			1
at issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for " peacefully protesting " on a public road easement along the enclosed high - security facility			1
while some on the court expressed concerns about the government 's claims , a majority of justices at wednesday 's lively hour of oral arguments appeared to offer little support for @entity2 's free speech and jurisdictional claims			1
" if you look at the easement " agreement between the @entity4 and the county , justice @entity44 said , " it makes it very clear that the military commander has authority to exercise control over the easement property			1
" " you 've got a public school and a public highway " on the base , justice @entity54 said			1
" i 'm not quite sure how you can keep a person off of lands that the military is not using in its operations			0
" the appeal presents a fact - specific inquiry into such issues as " concurrent " government jurisdiction , public forums and the limits of " exclusive control " asserted by the military			1
a ruling from the court in coming months could offer clearer guidelines for those like @entity23 seeking to protest on public land , where location is integral to their message			1
the 63 - year - old man and his wife , @entity80 , founded @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity6 , about a half - hour away from the base , which is along the scenic @entity84 , northwest of @entity85			0
the high - tech facility launches military satellites , operates aeronautical and space surveillance missions , and tests a variety of sophisticated weapons systems , including intercontinental ballistic missiles			0
running through its eastern boundary are state highways 1 and 246 , open to the traveling public			0
the federal government owns and operates the base , but the state and county have held a " use easement " for more than a half - century , and they maintain the roads			1
concurrent jurisdiction gives a measure of control of the narrow strip of land to all three entities			0
the @entity108 and their supporters from @entity110 , a group that opposes nuclear weapons , had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open " protest zone " created along the @entity114 bisecting the base			0
a special green line is designed to mark an off - limits area			0
@entity5 's commanding officer in 2003 issued a " barment order " against @entity2 after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism , including throwing blood on a base sign			1
a second " bar letter " was given four years later , after another trespassing incident			0
in 2010 , with the ban still in effect , @entity23 again entered the protest zone on repeated occasions , was told to leave , and was then escorted off the property			0
he says he has been arrested about 15 times			0
he sought to block the misdemeanor counts on free speech and other legal grounds			1
a federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor , saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military 's " exclusive right of possession			1
" the @entity143 then asked the @entity26 to intervene			2
at wednesday 's arguments , several conservative justices rebuffed the efforts by @entity148 attorney @entity147 to make this a predominately @entity150 case			0
" when an easement goes towards a public road , that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities , " he said			1
justice @entity44 said the issue was mainly about property ownership : " you 're back on the @entity150 case			0
it may or may not			0
if the commander wants to close the base for a rocket launch , he certainly can			2
" @entity147 : " the @entity4 wants it both ways			2
they want the benefits of having an easement there , in the sense that the state is responsible for maintaining the road , the state is liable for any harms on the road , and the state enforces crimes on the road			2
but they also want to claim that they have all of the control over that public road as they would within the base			1
" but justice @entity188 interjected : " they 're entitled to have it both ways			0
and if that 's the deal , take it or leave it , state : ' we 'll give you this easement , but the terms are what we have said			2
' what 's wrong with that ? " chief justice @entity203 agreed : " it 's been ceded by the @entity4 for the convenience of the traveling public			1
... the military commander has given permission to use the easement			1
" and @entity203 said that even though there has been a protest zone in place since 1989 , @entity2 can still be banned at the commander 's sole discretion			1
" he does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who 's vandalized the base in the past			2
" justice @entity221 , to @entity147 : " your argument is sort of a ' use it or lose it ' argument , is that correct ? that the government has this commanding authority , and unless it uses it to its full extent , every day of the week , it loses it ? one of the arguments that the government makes is , look , what the military wants to do here is something very sensible			2
it keeps tight what it needs to keep tight , but it allows to be more open areas that it does n't have an interest in securing entirely			0
and that 's for the convenience of military personnel and for other people who live around the base			1
what 's wrong with that ? " as for @entity23 , he told @entity1 after the arguments that he was hopeful of prevailing , and continuing his vigils at @entity5			0
" they 're denying my right to dissent on their base , " he said			0
" they 're systematically trying to keep me out there , but i 'm not going away			0
" the case is @entity4 v. @entity2 ( 12 - 1038 )			2
@entity26 appears split over frequent flyer case			1

lawyer for @entity4 military policy critic calls conviction for " peacefully protesting " *invalid*
he 's *accused* of trespassing at base ; his *defense* is that he was on a public road easement
@entity26 appears to offer little support for his free speech and jurisdictional claims
chief justice @entity203 : he can be banned from base at the commander 's sole discretion
