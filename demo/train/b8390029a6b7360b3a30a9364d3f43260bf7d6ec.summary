@entity0 -- @entity2 did n't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it			1
@entity2 was so impressed by a cappella groups ' performances of his songs , he made a record with them			1
the singer - songwriter says he was beyond impressed when he stumbled across videos of university a cappella groups singing covers of his songs on @entity18			1
" i was really moved , " he says			2
" i thought it was better than what i had done when i first heard it			2
that 's how it struck me because it was so fresh			2
" and so an idea was born : @entity2 would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers			1
the @entity29 native picked 15 ensembles from 250 submissions for " @entity2 presents : @entity32 ! " ( @entity33 ) , which came out tuesday			1
and to give the music a " field recording " feel , he kept the process simple : each performance was recorded using six wide - range microphones , and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes			1
" it 's a completely different point of view , " says @entity2 , 42 , of the students ' renderings of his tunes			1
" they 're not signed singers and artists that have their egos to contend with			2
and sometimes they 're not thinking about the song that much , which i think is kind of cool			2
" but not wanting to have the thunder completely stolen from him ( and probably to entice his loyal fans to shell out for the album ) @entity2 sings two a cappella tracks himself : " boxing " from his @entity59 days , and " @entity61 " from his 2008 solo album " @entity61			1
" " it was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up , " he says			2
" we did n't have a bunch of people to work with and i just about gave up			2
" @entity2 spoke to @entity1 about his youthful - sounding new release , why being married four times is n't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			1
@entity1 : is this the one and only @entity2 greatest hits album ? @entity2 : i think it naturally kind of is			1
i mean i was looking for something like that -- to possibly do a live orchestral album where the best material would kind of float to the top			1
but then again , someone 's going to want to release a greatest hits soon , so this is the other greatest hits			2
@entity1 : did you learn anything from the students ? @entity2 : yeah			1
i relearned a lot of stuff			2
... this is all so old school			2
i mean these guys , they 'd just do a live take and they just do n't know that the pros do n't do it that way			0
i mean , professional singers are a nightmare			0
you 've got ta tune every syllable , they have to do it 10,000 times			0
these guys just did it			0
@entity1 : and you went around each campus to record each track ? @entity2 : we kept them in what i would say is their natural habitat			1
i was really into the field recording idea			0
when you start messing with it and putting everyone on separate tracks you 've lost the event and you 've gained some sense of maybe perfection , but when it comes to the human voice , even - tempered piano tuning sounds incorrect to me			0
i think that people have a natural tuning mechanism			0
@entity1 : you 've always been very @entity130 savvy			0
do you @entity132 ? @entity2 : i 'm not sure what that is			1
there 's always something new			0
i think that my fans knew how to use computers before most people 's fans			0
i remember when everybody was talking about the possibility of downloading , and i was already having kids walk up with cds they had burned for me to sign			0
i was signing burned cds more than i was signing my own			0
so i think they get it			0
@entity1 : why did you decide to leak a fake version of your 2008 album " @entity61 ? " @entity2 : well , i think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there 's a process , an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record , mostly			1
and it also has to do with people 's general take on music and how it 's framed			0
i felt if something went out that was a joke and it was riding on the press of a new album , that we would be forced to go in and do something so quickly that we could n't monitor ourselves			1
so while i thought it was funny , i really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day			1
so we wrote and recorded six songs in a day , mixed that day while we played our gig that night			1
and then it was mastered the next day			0
and then we leaked it the third day			0
so in three days we wrote , recorded , mixed , mastered , distributed and did press on an album			2
i think things were kind of cool			0
@entity1 : you 've been married four times			0
is that helpful for singer - songwriter purposes ? i mean , that 's a lot of drama			2
@entity2 : well , it was n't a lot of drama , really			1
... everyone 's life is different and i think the pace at which i 've lived and the way that i tend to take a risk all contributes to the way that i write			0
... if you 've got kids it is a drama			0
but it 's the kind of drama you want to not write a song about			0
because one , the kids will hear it and secondly , i do n't like country music			0
@entity1 : how has having kids changed your outlook on music ? @entity2 : i have to work more quickly and more efficiently			1
@entity1 : who are you listening to at the moment ? @entity2 : i 'm in a habit of buying old 78 [ rpm ] records and i 've got a little record player i 'm carrying with me			1
@entity1 : that 's heavy			0
@entity2 : yeah , that 's heavy , dude			1
@entity1 : i meant physically heavy -- to carry around a record player			0
@entity2 : oh , that too			1
i would n't know about that with my ( jokingly flexes muscles ) -- it does n't really occur to me , those things .			0
