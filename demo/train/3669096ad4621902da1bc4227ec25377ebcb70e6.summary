@entity0 -- imagine that some member of @entity3 back in the 1990s had devoted himself or herself to toughening @entity6 against terrorism			1
he or she had introduced legislation to require airlines to harden their cockpit doors			1
after years of work , he or she at last prevailed and the new law went into effect sometime in early 2000			1
the 9/11 plot would have been thwarted without any @entity6 ever knowing that the plot had existed			1
question : would we now remember that imaginary member of @entity3 as a person of wisdom and foresight who averted a national disaster ? hardly			1
in a world in which 9/11 never happened , the people who prevented it would have gone unremembered and unthanked			2
it 's very possible that they would have been laughed at as tedious people who invested ridiculous amounts of energy against a probably imaginary threat -- the way , say , some laughed at the people who solved the @entity38 problem about that same time			2
of all the unfairnesses in politics , the greatest unfairness is how little we reward the supreme public service : " to provide against preventable evils , " in the famous phrase of the @entity46 politician , @entity47			2
the politicians who act after disaster reap the gratitude of the nation , like @entity53 amid the rubble of @entity55			1
officials whose warnings are ignored at least gain the credit of their prophecy if the warnings come to pass			1
but those who successfully mobilize public action in good time ? how would we even know who they are ? how do we separate the wise from the unwise , the genuinely visionary from the cranks and hysterics ? for every @entity70 urging early action about subprime mortgages , there are a hundred @entity73 urging @entity6 to stockpile nonhybrid seeds against the coming global apocalypse			2
the saddest fate of all , however , befalls the official who saves the country from a greater disaster by incurring or accepting some lesser damage			2
the politicians who supported the financial rescue in 2008 get no applause			1
sen. @entity84 of @entity85 lost his @entity87 primary in 2008 in large part due to his emphatic support of @entity90 , the @entity90			2
voters see politicians rushing money to rescue high - flying bankers from the bankers ' own irresponsibility and , naturally , the voters do not like it			1
the politicians insist that they acted to save the country from an even greater disaster			1
but who believes them ? for that matter , who even knows what such a " greater disaster " would possibly look like ? suppose for example that @entity108 and his administration had taken all the most exactly correct possible steps in response to the crash of 1929			0
suppose they had rapidly infused the banking system with emergency credit , gone off the gold standard when @entity46 did in 1931 , and organized the mutual forgiveness of the enormous debts and reparations left over from @entity120 suppose that -- thanks to this wise action -- the world economy had begun to recover in late 1931			1
in such a case , the worst year of the @entity125 -- 1932 -- would have been a year of slow economic improvement worldwide rather than radical economic collapse			0
in such a case , @entity129 might well never have come to power			0
( the @entity132 won their biggest political victory in the @entity135 parliamentary elections of july 1932 , when they won 37 % of the seats			0
when @entity135 next voted , in november 1932 , the @entity132 dropped 2 million votes			0
but by then the democratic system had nearly terminally collapsed			0
) timely effective action in 1929 - 30 might thus have prevented @entity140 yet the timeliest and most effective action in 1929 - 30 would still have left the @entity6 much worse off in november 1932 than in november 1928			0
@entity108 would still have presided over the worst recession in 20th century history and would still have lost the 1932 election to @entity145			0
no doubt @entity145 , that supreme opportunist , would have slammed @entity108 for his " bailouts " and " giveaways " to banks and foreigners			0
and who would ever have known what lay behind the door we did not open ? think of that limit on our knowledge , the next time you are inclined to a hasty judgment of political leaders and their measures			0
we know what we see			0
what we can not see may be what matters most			0
