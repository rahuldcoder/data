-- facing mounting criticism over the alleged behavior of one of his players , @entity2 head coach @entity1 says the buck stops with him			1
" i am in charge of the workplace atmosphere , " he said at a news conference			1
@entity1 said he was unaware of alleged misconduct by @entity13 against fellow offensive lineman @entity14 until @entity14 's representatives informed the team sunday evening			1
" we immediately took those concerns very , very seriously , " and informed @entity20 commissioner @entity19 to request a review , @entity1 said			1
@entity22 also reported that @entity14 never brought his concerns to @entity1			1
but many who know the ins and outs of pro football say @entity1 should have known what was going on in his ranks and taken action much sooner			1
" the recent developments in the @entity14 - @entity13 situation ( have ) shown us one thing : @entity1 is to blame for the turmoil in the @entity2 ' locker room , " writes @entity34 of @entity35			1
" first and foremost , an @entity20 head coach needs to know what 's going on within his own locker room			1
if there 's a player bullying another player , sending him threatening voice mails and text messages while making him feel uncomfortable on a daily basis , the head coach has to be aware of it			1
" the central allegation against @entity13 involves messages to @entity14 , including a voice mail in which @entity13 allegedly used racial slurs , threatened physical violence , and used the words , " i 'll kill you			2
" @entity14 's representatives have turned materials over to the @entity20 for an investigation			2
@entity13 allegedly also got @entity14 to contribute $ 15,000 to help finance a trip to @entity59 by a group of @entity2 even though @entity14 preferred not to travel with them			1
@entity14 gave @entity13 the money , fearing the consequences if he did not , @entity22 reported			2
@entity13 , on @entity64 , accused a news organization of " attaching my name to false speculation , " but that tweet and others were later deleted , according to @entity70			2
@entity13 has been suspended ; @entity14 left the team			2
it 's unclear what lies in store for either of them			0
@entity13 said tuesday he is " weathering the storm right now			2
" @entity13 , @entity14 , and the @entity20 's future @entity1 " is ultimately to blame here , " @entity78 writes at @entity79			1
" ... @entity1 either actively neglected his team culture ( his claim ) or he knew and did nothing ( which would be worse )			2
let 's give him the benefit of the doubt -- at best , he is an appallingly ineffective leader			0
" the @entity87 reports that @entity2 coaches had asked @entity13 to toughen up @entity14 -- orders he may have taken too far			1
the report does not say whether @entity1 himself made the request			1
@entity1 did tell players each year to " cut out " rookie hazing , the paper reports			2
but how much are @entity20 coaches really expected to police their teams ? by and large , they " let their players , and especially their seasoned veterans , maintain harmony in the locker room , " @entity98 writes in the @entity99			1
" in the crudest sense , they are hired to build a winning team , and as long as players do their jobs well , what happens elsewhere is largely immaterial			0
" " to some extent , the inmates run the asylum , " @entity109 , a defensive end who spent 14 years in the @entity20 , told the @entity99			1
" the coaches have a lot of other things to deal with			0
" no organization speaks for all @entity20 coaches			1
the @entity119 " represents the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches , " according to the website of its executive director , @entity121			0
he was not immediately available wednesday to discuss this issue			0
@entity125 , who played with @entity13 in @entity126 , said he believes a coach should only step in if behind - the - scenes behavior affects play on the field			1
" the locker room , we keep coaches out for a reason			0
it 's our space , " @entity125 told @entity134 in @entity135 , according to @entity20			2
there is " a lack of leadership in that locker room , " he said of the @entity2			0
some coaches have been credited with taking disturbing behavior seriously			0
" hall of famer @entity144 's coaching tree never tolerated any form of hazing or harassing			0
@entity148 does n't allow it in @entity150			0
@entity151 and @entity152 have said they 've never witnessed bullying to the extent that is alleged in this circumstance , " @entity20 reports			0
as the conflict between @entity13 and @entity14 spirals into a time of reckoning for the entire @entity20 , league officials face the task of laying out in clear terms just what coaches are responsible for -- and how to punish coaches when their players cross the line			1
@entity1 has compared running a team to running a school			0
when his two children go to school each day , " i have certain expectations that the administration , the teachers and the staff are going to create a safe atmosphere where my children can learn and develop as people , " he said at his news conference monday			0
" this is no different , " he added			0
" i take this responsibility very seriously			0
" but even if @entity1 shoulders blame for what allegedly transpired in his team , he 's not alone , says columnist @entity187 of foxsports.com			0
she points to others in the team 's leadership and the players themselves			0
" ( @entity194 ) t is every person who saw what was happening to @entity14 and did nothing who deserve our condemnation			0
