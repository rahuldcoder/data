@entity3 former @entity2 gov. @entity1 's death leaves @entity6 liberalism with one fewer voice , but his former colleagues say his words and deeds as governor of @entity2 will echo long after his passing			1
@entity2 rep. @entity13 , who worked with him as assistant secretary of state before she was elected to @entity15 , said part of his power was how he couched the liberal ideal of government as a helping hand for the needy in relatable terms			0
" what was so important to my development was his absolute conviction that people wanted a hand up , not a handout , " @entity13 said			0
@entity2 @entity30 strategist @entity29 said much of his appeal and legacy — and why he remains a rarity in politics today — is that he was unapologetic in his ideals and beliefs			1
" he did n't need any spin doctors			0
he did n't need to be told what to do			0
if he had something on his mind he said it , he told you exactly how he felt , and he did n't regret any of it , " @entity29 said			0
related : former @entity2 gov. @entity1 dies at 82 ; we 've ' lost a giant ' still , his allies admit that his soaring oratory was at times constrained by the earth - bound realities of a difficult economy and partisan opposition in the statehouse			1
former @entity2 @entity30 assemblyman @entity53 said that he was often met with disappointment by teachers ' unions and other constituencies in the state with a budget that might have been balanced but did n't do enough for them			0
" there were some difficult conditions in the late 80s , early 90s , in terms of fiscal conditions of the state and i think he realized that , " @entity53 said			0
" it 's never easy satisfying all of your constituencies			2
" he remembered that in the early 90s during a year when the governor had promised a certain level of funding for education that he ultimately could n't deliver on because of the state 's financial difficulties , @entity1 admitted during his subsequent state of the state address that " he was disappointed in himself because as an executive he had failed			1
" many of his accomplishments were " prosaic , " said @entity82 , one of his spokesmen			2
@entity1 passed the nation 's first mandatory seatbelt law , vetoed the death penalty for the dozen years he was in office and supported an assault weapons ban			1
related : @entity1 and @entity89 : a complicated , but mutually beneficial , relationship at a time when crime was rampant in @entity93 in particular , @entity1 built more jails in @entity2 than any other governor in the state 's history , hardly an accomplishment many liberals would tout but one his contemporaries hailed as fruitful and necessary			1
@entity1 also named the 90s the " decade of the child " and worked to encourage more investment in early childhood education , though many of his efforts on that front did n't bear fruit until he was out of office			2
@entity82 said , however , the little things mattered to the governor			2
" the seatbelt law and requiring deposits on bottles seem prosaic , but he liked the nitty - gritty things , " @entity82 said			2
but the disappointments of his tenure might be overshadowed by his use of a lofty rhetorical talent to defend and promote his unapologetically liberal beliefs			0
@entity1 's value as an " eloquent voice for the voiceless , " @entity82 said , was " difficult to discount , " at a time when many of the liberal beliefs he espoused were taking a pummeling in the public sphere by @entity129 , led by then - president @entity130			1
related : @entity131 on death of @entity1 : he was a ' determined champion of progressive values ' " his impact was reminding people of conscience that there were issues left to be addressed , " he said , remembering his 1984 @entity135 speech -- and landmark public event			2
it was a voice that " brought morality into the public sphere and kept it there , " @entity29 said , by issuing a fiery and convincing speech defending legal abortion , despite his deep @entity151 beliefs , in an address to @entity153			2
" it took tremendous courage as a @entity151 to stand up at @entity153 and take on his church on abortion , " @entity29 said			0
it was a voice that brought the parties to the table for a measured and substantial discussion on the issues , many of his contemporaries said			0
rep. @entity165 remembers that " those of us in the legislature always have problems with the executive , " but that @entity1 was still effective			2
" what we 're talking about here , though , is a man that had the intellect and ability to work with @entity30 and @entity129 and get the ball moving forward , " @entity165 said			0
when @entity1 campaigned in @entity53 's conservative @entity180 - district , where it was " much more conservative , " he said , @entity1 would still take up the debate on less popular issues			1
" the governor was very good at articulating his position and using substantial arguments to support his position , " he said			0
his death leaves one clear inheritor of his legacy , both " literally and figuratively , " @entity13 said — @entity190 , his son who was sworn in to a second term as governor shortly before the elder @entity1 passed away			1
" @entity190 , as governor , because of his pragmatism has been extraordinarily successful in actually putting in policies to implement @entity1 's vision , " @entity13 said			1
in some ways president @entity131 , also known for his oratorical skills , is another inheritor of his legacy — but like @entity1 , @entity131 faced the same constraints of governing at a time of recession and austerity , in the face of an often unwilling and intractable legislature			1
related : @entity2 area republicans praise liberal icon @entity1 in others , the resurgence of the liberal left may have its roots in @entity1 's tenure as governor			1
@entity93 mayor @entity216 's unabashed commitment to liberal ideals against a skeptical city echoes in many ways the governor 's commitment to criminal justice reform , civil rights and other and sen. @entity224 , another rising liberal star , may echo @entity1 in her fiery speeches on @entity226 and the middle class			1
but in many ways the conditions that created @entity1 , and made him such a valuable figure in liberal politics , have passed			2
even then , @entity1 was aware that words can only go so far , and that @entity6 ' patience for the careful phrasing and nuanced argument he was so apt at delivering had already begun to wear thin			1
" i 've learned that the only way to communicate successfully " as a governor , he told a group of reporters during an exit interview with reporters , " is simplicity and reiteration			0
constant reiteration of simple ideas			0
" and he acknowledged , " i have also decided i 'm not capable of doing it			0
" @entity165 said that today 's often toxic atmosphere of partisanship makes it difficult for anyone to have the sort of conversation with the public that @entity1 revered and did so well			1
" i do n't think anyone could get out of the billions and trillions of dollars that have been poured in for [ the parties ] to negatively attack each other , " he said			0
" but if there 's anyone that could do it , it would 've been @entity1			1
" people we lost : 2014			0

gov. @entity1 's most lasting legacy remains his " eloquent voice for the voiceless "
while his accomplishments as governor were often more " prosaic , " he moved @entity6 with his speeches
his son , supporters say , is a clear inheritor of his legacy
