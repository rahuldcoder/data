@entity0 -- summer excursions seem out of reach to many struggling young professionals , and the faltering economy is n't helping			1
but one @entity0 company , offering trips aimed at the young and thrifty , is capitalizing on the urbanite 's desire to get away -- and finding success despite the downturn			1
a group of @entity14 hikers stops for a snack during an expedition in @entity0 's @entity17			1
as a slightly broke young professional myself , with a taste for adventure but living in a very expensive city , the idea behind @entity14 was intriguing			1
the company offers an array of activities -- from short hiking , sky diving or canoeing trips to international journeys that combine various activities			1
on the company 's user - friendly web site , i scrolled through the offerings			1
there were trips ranging from one - day hiking or fruit - picking excursions priced at around $ 60 to $ 800 weeklong international expeditions			1
the average trip includes ground transportation , the cost of the activity , guide fees , equipment rental and meals			2
jumping out of planes put the company 's founder and ceo , @entity50 , 25 , on the path to becoming a business owner			1
while attending @entity53 , @entity50 developed a passion for sky diving			2
to pay for the pricey dives , she began to lead trips for her friends and her friends ' friends			1
soon she realized that the people she was guiding were outside of her original social network , and an idea began to emerge			0
after graduating from @entity53 and working as a trader on the @entity65 , @entity50 decided working in the concrete jungle was not for her			1
at 24 , @entity50 started a business out of something she had been doing for years during college -- leading outdoor adventure trips			1
the company launched in early 2008 , just months before the economy tanked			1
" i started to wonder if this is really going to work , " @entity50 said			0
but with trips designed with budget and value in mind , the suffering economy did not stunt the business			2
@entity50 said the company was able to break even within six months			1
the business relies on social networking avenues for promotion , and word spread rapidly			0
it also quickly developed a reputation as a great way to meet people and make new friends			0
" i was the market , " @entity50 explains , " my friends were the market			0
anyone just out of college working on @entity95 did n't have the time to plan and research the trips			2
there is no shortage of those kinds of people in @entity0			1
" after perusing the site , i rather nervously picked a $ 59 six - mile hike			2
this may not sound so cheap , but after factoring in the planning of the trip , transportation , gas , experienced guides and a post-hike discount at a local restaurant , the value becomes apparent			0
i had n't been hiking in years and still am sadly out of shape			0
my imagination ran wild with images of young , sporty folks racing up high peaks as i huffed and puffed behind			2
after a rainy start to the morning , our upbeat guides for the day , director @entity120 and guide @entity121 , drove a group of 12 north of the city to @entity17			1
they encouraged us to get to know each other and joked that we would be quizzed on it later			0
waiting to get into the van , i asked a man standing next to me why he was on the trip			0
" i moved from @entity136 a year ago , " public relations professional @entity134 said			0
" i need some trees			0
" after an hourlong drive , we arrived at our hiking destination			0
@entity120 and @entity121 checked our sneakers , water supply and told us a bit about how the day was going to unfold			2
and then we began the hike			0
throughout the day , there was lots of laughing , squealing and helping each other over rocks and through slick patches of mud			2
i was surprised how quickly a team mentally developed among the group			0
we were all strangers , but after a day of hiking , i knew everyone 's name , profession and a good deal more			2
and this was no accident -- the guides were deliberately networking and bonding us together			0
@entity159 , a city transit planner , was on her third trip with @entity14			1
" i went by myself my first hike , " she said			0
" it was fun to get away and do something different			0
" she said she still keeps in touch with people she met on the other excursions			0
" i made some good friends out of it , " she said			0
at the end of the day , sweaty , sore and smiling , i realized why @entity14 was defying the recession			1
with a plethora of affordable outdoor excursions , cheerful guides and a youthful mindset , the company was the ideal destination for an urban professional with a slim wallet .			1
