" a @entity5 would help me to begin this campaign for girls ' education , " she told @entity42			2
in the long run , @entity3 plans to hold out for an even bigger award			2
" but the real call , the most precious call , that i want to get and for which i 'm thirsting and for which i want to struggle hard , that is the award to see every child to go to school , that is the award of peace and education for every child			2
and for that , i will struggle and i will work hard			2

@entity3 would have been the youngest recipient of any @entity8
