-- a clinical second half strike from @entity2 sealed a famous @entity4 victory for @entity5 over @entity6 to cap a triumphant return to @entity8 for their coach @entity9			1
the @entity12 striker seized on a fine through pass from @entity14 to score the only goal of the second leg in the 78th minute to give the @entity18 champions a 3 - 1 aggregate victory			1
it was no more than @entity9 and his men deserved after having several excellent chances to put the tie beyond @entity6 's reach			1
@entity5 led the last 16 clash 2 - 1 from the first leg in the @entity27 , but many were expecting @entity30 title challengers @entity6 to overturn the deficit			1
but they reckoned without the tactical wiles of their former manager @entity9 and @entity36 's men scarcely created a chance throughout the 90 minutes as the prolific @entity38 and strike partner @entity39 were blunted			1
to cap a dismal evening for @entity41 international @entity38 , he was sent off five minutes from the end for a stamping incident on @entity44 in the @entity5 penalty area			1
former @entity46 star @entity2 had begun his evening by wasting an opportunity to put his side further ahead in the opening skirmishes as a @entity51 mistake left him to head tamely at @entity52 from close range			0
a feature of the first half was a number of last - ditch blocks by @entity5 defenders , the first by @entity60 as @entity38 was left with a clear sight of goal			2
@entity63 also denied @entity64 and @entity6 appealed in vain for a penalty when @entity44 tangled with @entity67 after a corner			0
@entity6 ended the half besieging the @entity5 goal and their prospects looked bright for the second half , but it was @entity5 who proved the more dangerous on the break			2
@entity14 exploited gaps on the @entity6 defense and from his pass the best chance fell to @entity80 @entity79 but he scuffed his shot wide of @entity52 and the goal			0
@entity44 also headed wide from close range , but when @entity2 was given the same opportunity he showed his quality and might have added another but for a fine save by @entity52 after @entity38 had left @entity6 with 10 men			2
@entity9 said his team had given the " perfect performance " but was growing concerned after they had wasted several excellent chances			0
" when we did score , @entity6 were completely out of the game			0
i thought everything was superior , not just our tactics but our attitude on the pitch , " the @entity95 coach told @entity96 .			0

@entity5 beat @entity6 1 - 0 at @entity8 to win last 16 tie 3 - 1 on aggregate
a 78th minute goal from @entity2 *settles* @entity4 clash
@entity6 's @entity38 is sent off five minutes from time after stamping incident
@entity5 coach @entity9 guided @entity6 to two @entity30 titles
