@entity1 state television reported @entity20 , a longtime member of parliament who has served in several administrations , was selected			2
the candidate served as @entity9 's textile minister			1
@entity23 is considered a @entity24 likely to adhere to the party agenda if elected			0
the @entity27 declared @entity9 disqualified retroactive to april 26 , the day he was convicted of contempt charges stemming from his refusal to call on @entity32 authorities to reopen old corruption charges against @entity13			1
" since no appeal was filed against this judgment , the conviction has attained finality , " said the ruling , read in the court by chief justice @entity36			0
" he has also ceased to be the prime minister of @entity1 with effect from the said date ( april 26 ) , and office of the prime minister shall be deemed to be vacant accordingly			1
" the speaker of @entity1 's @entity47 had 30 days from the day of the april verdict to ask the @entity49 to pursue disqualification proceedings if she viewed @entity9 's conviction as cause for dismissal			1
in a five - page decision released last month , speaker @entity54 said she did not believe the prime minister 's refusal to follow the @entity27 's order justified disqualification			1

the @entity109 and the @entity107 government have been concerned that the warfare and instability could hurt the government			0
but the crisis and a possible departure of the prime minister would n't have a seismic effect on the nation 's stability and political system because the country 's civilian government is dominated by the @entity17			1
a new prime minister would simply take the place of @entity9 as a representative of the party			1
