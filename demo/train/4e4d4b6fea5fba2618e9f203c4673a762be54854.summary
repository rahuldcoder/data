@entity0 -- new disclosures that the @entity3 targeted liberals as well as conservatives in assessing applications for tax - exempt status have reshaped perceptions of the scandal , shifting the focus away from @entity12 claims of political villainy			1
@entity3 targeting included liberal groups investigations by the @entity17 , congressional committees , the @entity21 inspector general 's office and the @entity3 continue , but monday 's revelations bolstered assertions by agency officials and @entity25 that the problem was egregious mismanagement instead of intentional misconduct by the @entity30 administration			0
shifting polls contradict key deposition @entity34 @entity33 of @entity35 told @entity1 on tuesday that the priority now should be to ensure that laws and regulations prohibiting political groups from getting tax - exempt status are properly enforced , regardless of whether organizations are on left or right			1
" these groups are in some ways giving the appearance that their primary purpose is the common good , the common welfare ... when they are actively engaged in political activity , for which they should n't be getting a tax deduction , " @entity33 said			1
however , rep. @entity53 of @entity54 argued too many questions remain unanswered to stop investigating whether politics played a role in the controversy			1
" what we still do n't know is who ordered this kind of targeting , why did it take so long for them to clean it up ? " @entity53 , the 2012 @entity12 vice presidential nominee , told @entity67			2
asked if the claim of political motivation now seemed less valid , he responded : " i do n't know the answer to that , so we 're going to let the facts take us where they take us			0
" in particular , @entity53 said he wanted more details on why conservative - oriented groups had their tax - exempt applications stalled and experienced harassing behavior by the @entity3 , such as having to answer inappropriate questions about the beliefs and activities of members			1
at the same time , he sounded like @entity33 in saying the bigger question involved the practice of targeting , rather than who specifically got targeted			1
@entity1 poll : did @entity86 order @entity3 targeting ? " we know that the @entity3 did target people based upon their political beliefs , " @entity53 said			1
" who cares whether they 're right or left ? ... the fact that they 're targeting people for harassment based upon their political beliefs should be cause enough alone for outrage			0
" that 's a big change from inferences by @entity12 leaders in recent weeks that the @entity30 administration was likely behind the targeting that started in 2010 in an effort to subdue political rivals			0
with no evidence to date of any such connection , it was unclear how hard congressional committees would continue pushing the issue			0
the @entity12 - led @entity108 has scheduled a hearing on thursday on an initial review of the @entity3 targeting by the agency 's temporary leader , @entity111			2
president @entity30 appointed @entity111 to clean up the @entity3 mess last month after an inspector general 's audit uncovered targeting of applications that contained conservative - themed words such as " tea party			2
" the audit by @entity121 only cited the targeting of conservative groups , which it said ended in may 2012			1
read @entity3 watchdog 's report in his first substantive report on the agency , @entity111 said monday that its tax - exempt unit used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax - exempt applications until earlier this month , more than a year later than previously revealed			1
the " @entity141 " or bolo lists included liberal - themed words such as " progressives " and other politically oriented terms such as " occupy " and " medical marijuana " in alerting @entity3 workers to check for unacceptable political activities , according to copies made available by @entity25 rep. @entity139 of @entity140			2
@entity111 said he has suspended the use of @entity145 lists in considering tax - exempt applications for now			1
a statement by @entity139 questioned why @entity149 's audit focused only on @entity145 lists that contained conservative labels			0
the inspector general 's report " served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations , and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way , " @entity139 's statement said			0
a spokesperson for @entity149 later responded that the report focused only on @entity145 criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax - exempt status			1
@entity12 have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration , an accusation denied by the @entity86 and the @entity3			2
@entity175 : @entity30 administration a ' culture of intimidation ' in response to @entity139 's statement , @entity108 chairman rep. @entity179 , @entity140 , said the inclusion of " progressives " on a bolo list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general 's report			1
the release of @entity149 's audit last month ignited a political firestorm in @entity0 while fueling conservative mistrust of @entity30 's administration as an example of big government gone wild			2
@entity111 noted monday that his internal investigation , while still incomplete , found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by @entity3 personnel or involvement by anyone outside the @entity3			0
he also said no evidence had emerged that in appropriate targeting extended into other areas of the agency			0
five @entity3 managers have been replaced , from the previous acting commissioner whom @entity111 succeeded to the head of the unit based in @entity209 that handles tax - exempt applications			1
in addition , @entity111 created an @entity212 to recommend within 60 days " any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible " for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general 's report			0
@entity86 spokesman @entity216 said monday that @entity30 believes @entity111 's report " is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately , identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen , and takes a forward - looking systemic view at the agency 's management			2
" in his audit that disclosed the misconduct , @entity149 said there was no evidence of a political motive			0
however , he is continuing to investigate the matter , along with the @entity17 and the congressional committees			0
as part of his review , @entity111 said 80 groups awaiting @entity3 action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self - register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations			1
at the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax - exempt status			1
regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities , while political groups are considered ineligible			1
confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the @entity3 , @entity111 said			0
an @entity3 statement on monday said the " safe - harbor " option for self - certification would apply to groups that " certify they devote 60 % or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare			2
" " at the same time , they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40 % or less of both their spending and time , " the statement said			0
applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self - certification , it said			2
earlier : what 's a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) ? @entity111 said the @entity3 would continue checking on tax - exempt groups to ensure they were following the law			1
separately , the @entity282 , which has been aggressively investigating the @entity3 matter , plans to meet on friday to consider a resolution aimed at resolving questions about whether a key agency official must testify			0
@entity286 was the director of exempt organizations when the agency filtered applications for tax exempt status			1
she appeared before the committee in may and said she had broken no laws or regulations and then invoked her constitutional right not to answer questions			0
@entity286 pleads the 5th several committee @entity12 questioned whether she waived that right by making her opening statement , and @entity299 chairman @entity298 said she could be called back at a later date if that were the case			0
@entity1 's @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
