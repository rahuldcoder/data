is the glass ceiling in @entity1 finally beginning to crack ? a new report on the gender makeup of @entity4 company boardrooms suggests that just might be the case -- but not all the experts are convinced			1
women now account for 20.7 % of @entity4 executive board members , an increase of 12.5 % since 2011 , according to @entity15 's @entity14 report released wednesday			1
@entity16 , a former @entity1 trade minister who has been tasked with improving gender equality in @entity1 's boardrooms , described the findings as " impressive " but only part of the journey toward gender fairness at the top of the country 's leading firms			1
" we are finally seeing a culture change taking place at the heart of @entity1 business , " @entity16 said			1
real progress ? there are now only two members of the @entity4 -- copper mining company @entity34 and natural resources group @entity36 -- with no female board representation , compared to one company in five in 2011			1
at the other end of the spectrum , drinks firm @entity39 and business process outsourcing company @entity39 , are setting the pace with 44.4 % female representation on their boards			0
@entity1 has set itself a target of having women make up 25 % of @entity4 board members by 2015			1
this objective will be met with a further 48 appointments of women to boardroom positions within @entity4 companies in the next year			2
but while these headline figures may cast @entity1 's progress on this issue in an impressive light , a closer inspection reveals a far more complex picture			2
according to the @entity62 study , there are 48 companies in the @entity64 ( which lists the 101st to 350th largest firms on the @entity7 ) with no female board representation			0
many of the new boardroom positions taken up by female @entity4 directors in recent years , meanwhile , are non-executive positions which do not form part of the executive management team and where power and influence is limited			1
" over the past year there were 52 new female appointments to @entity4 boards -- representing 27 % of all appointments , " said professor @entity75 , one of the report 's authors			2
" of these , only five were executive director positions and the remaining 47 were non-executive @entity83			2
" @entity85 's leaders the @entity1 government has looked to pressure publicly limited companies into addressing the issue of female board representation in recent years without legislating on the matter			2
other @entity92 nations , however , have introduced legally binding quota systems to help ensure female representation is guaranteed on the boards of leading publicly listed companies			0
the likes of the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have all regulated to varying extents in recent years , witnessing an improvement in female representation at non-executive boardroom level as a result			0
overall there are eight nations within the @entity107 -- including @entity99 ( 26.8 % ) and the @entity98 ( 23.6 % ) -- that have a greater number of women at boardroom level than the @entity1 , according to figures on board representation gathered by the @entity113 last year			1
outside the @entity107 , @entity114 was the first country to introduce boardroom gender quotas in 2006 and can now count as many as 40.5 % of executives in public limited companies as female , according to @entity119			0
but in all of these countries , as in @entity1 , women are still more likely to occupy non-executive roles as opposed to executive director roles			1
' it takes time ' @entity125 , co-author of the @entity62 study , says pressure must be brought to bear on firms to encourage them to genuinely foster female talent rather than just perform a gender box ticking exercise			0
" in order to close this gap and generate a sustainable talent pool , companies must invest more effort in developing the pipeline of female talent , " @entity125 said			0
others , such as @entity141 , executive director for @entity85 , an organization that promotes women in business , suggest that all change is good change even if it does n't have the desired impact straight away			2
" our research has actually shown that if you have three women on the board ( in non-executive positions ) this translates over a period of four to five years into 21 % more women in executive positions			1
" the executive positions are appointed by the board or at least approved by the board			0
if you have more women on the board then you will have a more diverse executive thought , " she added			0
" there is a correlation but it takes a bit of time			0

a new report shows women account for a fifth of @entity4 board members
@entity16 : " culture change taking place at the heart of @entity1 business "
*critics* say the figures mask reality as many of the roles are non-executive positions
