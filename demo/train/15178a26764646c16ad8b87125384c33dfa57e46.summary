-- this week , the world is learning that on august 21 , @entity4 's @entity3 regime attacked civilians living on the outskirts of @entity7 , killing at least 355 of them , including many small children			1
according to vice president @entity10 , there is " no doubt " that chemical weapons were used by the regime -- and not , as the @entity3 government has claimed , by rebel forces			1
the victims suffered terrible and painful deaths			0
many experts are concluding that most likely a nerve agent such as sarin was deployed			1
@entity21 is a type of organophosphate ( @entity24 ) , a class of chemicals used for making herbicides , insecticides and nerve gases			1
the effects of sarin and other ops on the human body are profound , shocking and can be long lasting			2
some exposures have left the surviving victims paralyzed for weeks , with perhaps permanent liver malfunctions and lingering neurological dysfunctions			0
ops disintegrate in a matter of hours			0
but during their comparatively brief period of volatile danger , the deadly molecules can pass through human skin , nostrils , lungs and eyes to enter the bloodstream and then the brain			0
if enough of it gets inside the brain to saturate the nervous system , an agonizing death follows			0
i first learned about sarin gas in 1978 when i was hired by the @entity56 to assess the human health impacts of 33,000 pesticide formulations used by farmers and pest eradication companies			1
obviously the state was n't serious about this			0
who hires a 26 - year - old graduate student immunologist to , by herself , evaluate so many chemicals ? what i found was that among the tens of thousands of chemicals used by growers and pest eradicators around the world , the most potent and popular were , and still are , the organophosphates			2
they kill insects by blocking proper regulation of the key chemical used by nerve cells , acetylcholine			2
( @entity32 became popular for agricultural use after @entity79 and some other chemicals were banned because they persist almost indefinitely in the environment			0
) but now and then , a farmworker might inhale the odorless , tasteless @entity24 chemicals when unknowingly downwind of a large pesticide spraying , and the ghastly neurological symptoms and deaths would ensue			0
to understand how and why such dangerous compounds had come into common use , i dug backwards in the scientific literature , landing on the 1938 invention of the first member of this chemical family , sarin , developed by @entity95 chemist @entity94			1
though @entity94 started down the sarin path in search of agricultural chemicals , he recognized its utility as a nerve gas and aided his military in its development and use during @entity105			1
during the @entity106 , the @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 all developed deadlier forms of @entity32 , including vx gas			1
in 1993 , the @entity113 's @entity112 banned sarin , @entity115 and other nerve gases			1
the @entity112 also targeted compounds used to make deadly gases , such as methylphosphonyl difluoride -- a harmless chemical until mixed with rubbing alcohol , creating sarin			1
the @entity112 was signed by 162 nations , including the @entity107 and @entity109			0
but @entity4 has never signed it , and the regime of @entity3 has stockpiled ready - to - mix methylphosphonyl difluoride in vast quantities			1
three decades ago , i found it shocking to learn that so much @entity24 pesticides used annually in the @entity107 to control insects were , chemically , close siblings to those deployed for genocidal purposes			2
but then it came back as a weapon of war			0
on march 16 , 1988 , the @entity138 government of @entity139 showered the @entity141 village of @entity142 with multiple chemical agents , including sarin , killing several thousand civilians			1
this was the largest - scale chemical weapons attack in modern history			1
seven years later , the first terrorist use of sarin occurred in @entity151 , carried out by the strange religious cult @entity152			2
on march 20 , 1995 , the group released sarin in the city 's subway system , killing 13 people and injuring more than 6000 , with many requiring hospitalization			2
more recently , an apparently corrupt principal in @entity161 fed children in her school cheap , @entity24 - contaminated lunches , killing at least 25 youngsters			0
witnesses described the children 's hideous deaths as the pesticides caused their nervous systems to send signals to their muscles , leading to spasms and seizures			2
and then , in response , their lungs became paralyzed and the terrified children gasped and suffocated until they died			0
in december , the @entity178 and @entity179 magazine reported that the @entity3 government was moving some of its chemical weapons in an apparent preparation for an attack			1
the deadly stockpile was stored in a safe form			0
a launchable shell is divided in half by a thin membrane			0
on one side is rubbing alcohol , on the other , methylphosphonyl difluoride			0
divided , the chemicals pose no hazard and can easily be transported and stored			0
but upon detonation , the membrane bursts , the chemicals mix , sarin gas is made and it showers upon those unfortunates below			2
in march , sarin was used in @entity4 in a small attack			1
@entity113 investigators have testimony that rebel forces may have used it			0
this month 's attacks outside of @entity7 , however , was clearly carried out by the @entity3 regime , according to the @entity107 and @entity108			1
a year ago on august 20 , president @entity206 made his now - famous " red line " remark , stating : " we have been very clear to the @entity3 regime , but also to other players on the ground , that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized			1
that would change my calculus			0
that would change my equation			0
" that was the diplomatic line in the sand for the @entity107 in october of the same year , @entity219 , @entity220 's foreign minister at the time , addressed the @entity223 in @entity224 and drew his line			0
i asked him , " if the @entity4 government makes use of its well - known stockpiles of either biological or chemical weapons , and the wind blows said weapons across your border , claiming @entity220 lives , will this be considered a national security threat ? " " certainly , that situation is a situation that will end everything , " @entity219 said			1
@entity220 is the key ally of the @entity3 regime			1
but what if powerful winds were to carry sarin or other chemical weapons from @entity4 to the @entity220 border ? @entity219 added , " that is the end of the validity , eligibility , legality , whatever you name it , of that government			1
weapons of mass destruction , as we said , is against humanity			2
it 's something that is not at all acceptable			0
and therefore , if your hypothesis , @entity261 forbid , ever materializes , i think nobody can justify it anymore , nobody can go along with anybody who has been involved in such act of -- i would say inhuman act			0
" the @entity3 regime is playing with regional fire			1
while the possibility of a wind carrying sarin to far - away @entity220 might be ridiculous , the @entity269 border is merely 15 miles from @entity7 and @entity273 's is 70 miles away			2
a " new normal " has descended over the @entity274 since the 2011 @entity275 , pushing ever more dangerous boundaries of instability and brutality , mass refugee exoduses , tough military crackdowns , suicide bombings , demolition of mosques and coptic churches and spread of diseases			0
it would be nightmarish in the extreme were use of chemical weapons -- deployment for purposes of mass asphyxiation -- to join the awful " new normal " litany of despair			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity298 .			2

@entity4 's @entity3 regime is *accused* of using chemical weapons on civilians
@entity298 : @entity21 probably was deployed ; those who die from it suffer terribly
she says sarin was developed in @entity105 era as a potent form of destruction
@entity313 : it would be nightmare for @entity4 to experience toxic gas in a litany of despair
