the @entity1 is cutting funding to the @entity5 education and science agency @entity3 after the agency voted to accept a @entity8 bid for full membership , the @entity0 said monday			1
" today 's vote by the member states of @entity3 to admit @entity13 as member is regrettable , premature and undermines our shared goal of a comprehensive just and lasting peace in the @entity18 , " said @entity0 spokeswoman @entity10			1
" the @entity1 will refrain from making contributions to @entity3 , " she said			2
the @entity1 was going to make a $ 60 million payment in november , and will now not do so , she said			0
some @entity1 lawmakers had called on the @entity23 administration to withhold funding to @entity3 if the measure was approved			2
how the @entity1 decision could be counterproductive the lawmakers cited @entity1 law , which states that funds must be denied to any organization granting the @entity30 " the same standing as member states			0
" a spokeswoman for the @entity33 to @entity3 -- the @entity3 -- said the @entity1 contributes $ 80 million a year			2
the @entity1 contribution comprises 22 % of the agency 's funding in its regular budget , a spokeswoman for @entity3 said			2
the vote , which required two - thirds approval by @entity3 members , passed with 107 in favor , 14 against , and 52 abstentions			1
it was the first such vote by a part of the world body			0
the vote is separate from the @entity8 bid for full membership in the @entity3			1
representatives of several countries pointed out that currently that bid is being discussed by members of the @entity55			0
huge applause broke out at the meeting in @entity58 when the results of the vote were announced			0
@entity3 director - general @entity61 , speaking after the vote , said she is concerned for the financial stability of the organization			1
" i believe it is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that @entity3 does not suffer unduly , " she said , specifically citing concerns about losing funding from " our largest contributor , the @entity1			2
" @entity61 said the " admission of a new member state is a mark of respect and confidence			0
" @entity5 secretary general ban ki - moon addressed the concern as well , saying " we will need to work on practical solutions to preserve @entity3 's financial resources			1
" @entity81 said he had no further comment , although he noted " the urgency of a negotiated solution of the @entity18 peace process			0
" @entity89 , the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity3 , posted on her @entity91 account : " today 's vote to grant @entity8 membership in @entity3 is no substitute for direct negotiations , but it is deeply damaging to @entity3			1
" @entity3 , which is headquartered in @entity58 , works to promote peace and sustainable development through education , the sciences and culture			1
@entity100 spokesman @entity99 said the vote " is premature and undermines the international community 's shared goal of a comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the @entity18			0
today 's vote distracts us from our shared goal of direct negotiations that results in a secure @entity107 and an independent @entity13 living side by side in peace and security			1
" @entity8 leaders celebrated the vote			2
" this is a significant victory and sends a clear message to those who are trying to hold history and deny the rights of @entity8 that there are a majority of nations with conscience who refuse to be intimidated and blackmailed , " said @entity114 , a member of the @entity30 's @entity115 , speaking by phone from @entity117 , in the @entity118			1
" the ones who voted negatively are isolating themselves along with @entity107 on the wrong side of justice and the law			0
and if the @entity1 continues to threaten to boycott or withdrawal from organizations that recognizes @entity13 it might find itself outside most global institutions with diminishing influence and standing , " she said			0
@entity140 , adviser to @entity8 president @entity141 , said , " this is a historic moment , a moment of jubilation on route to full recognition of @entity8 independence and self - determination , that 's equally a call for reconsideration of positions to those wavering on the @entity55 vote			1
" it is also a foundation stone for what 's to come at the ( @entity55 ) and other international organizations			0
today 's experience is a manifestation of ability of the international community to defy occupation and practically work towards ending it			0
" the @entity107 representative , @entity165 , addressing the meeting after the vote , called the decision " a tragedy for @entity3 " and " a great disservice to international law			1
" @entity3 has now " adopted the science fiction version of reality by admitting a nonexistent state to the science organization , " he said			0
in a statement , @entity107 's @entity176 said , " this is a unilateral @entity8 maneuver which will bring no change on the ground but further removes the possibility for a peace agreement			1
this decision will not turn the @entity184 into an actual state yet places unnecessary burdens on the route to renewing negotiations			0
@entity107 believes that the correct and only way to make progress in the diplomatic process with the @entity8 is through direct negotiations without preconditions			1
" @entity107 prime minister @entity194 referred to the vote during remarks at the start of the @entity199 winter session			2
" instead of sitting around the negotiating table , " @entity194 said , @entity8 leaders " have decided to make an alliance with @entity202 and are carrying out one - sided endeavors in the @entity5 , including today			1
we will not sit with folded arms against these measures which are hurting @entity107 and are violating bluntly the most basic obligations the parties took in the peace process , to solve the conflict between us through negotiations			2
sadly , during the time we are trying to form a @entity8 state with a peace agreement they are trying to form a state without an agreement			2
" @entity217 , the @entity1 permanent representative to @entity3 , said the @entity1 " can not accept the premature @entity8 admission for membership in a @entity3 specialized agency such as @entity3			1
" " despite the challenges ahead , we pledge to continue our efforts to find ways to support and strengthen the important work of this vital organization , " he said , addressing the @entity3 meeting after the vote			2
@entity217 did not say what could happen to @entity1 funding for @entity3			0
the @entity231 representative called the decision " momentous			0
" " for over six decades , @entity8 have proven to be superb human beings but have regrettably remained without their rights , " she said , adding that " today this wrong has been righted			0
" she referred to the longtime @entity8 leader @entity236 as an " inimitable hero			0
" the representative from @entity239 said that with its vote , @entity3 " acted precisely as the conscience of the world community			2
" " i think that by showing @entity13 's independence is an idea whose time has come and that this has brought recognition in the world community , we have in fact bolstered all the efforts which with respect towards a negotiated peace and towards the recognition that is sought in the @entity55 , " he said			2
earlier , as the vote was under way , applause broke out after some countries voted in favor of the bid			0
there was laughter in the room after @entity107 voted no. in september , @entity184 president @entity141 launched the bid for the @entity3 to recognize a @entity8 state			1
@entity3 is the first agency the @entity8 have sought to join			1
the @entity184 - run @entity268 news agency reported late on monday that @entity13 is preparing to apply for full membership in the @entity270			1
since @entity8 leaders made the request for membership in @entity3 earlier this month , @entity1 lawmakers have urged the agency to reject it			1
" any recognition of @entity13 as a @entity282 would not only jeopardize the hope for a resumption of direct @entity107 - @entity8 negotiations , but ( it ) would endanger the @entity1 ' contribution to @entity3 , " said an october 13 letter signed by members of the @entity277 on @entity278 and @entity279 , which appropriates @entity3 's @entity1 funding			1
rep. @entity287 , @entity288 , who chairs the subcommittee , said she will " advocate for all funding to be cut off			0
" " this is consistent with current law , and i will consider additional actions as needed , " she said this month			0
" there are consequences for short - cutting the process , not only for the @entity8 , but for our longstanding relationship with the @entity3			1
" she was referring to a provision of @entity1 code which states : " no funds authorized to be appropriated by this @entity301 or any other @entity301 shall be available for the @entity3 or any specialized agency thereof which accords the @entity30 the same standing as member states			0
" rep. @entity305 , @entity306 , chairwoman of the @entity307 , slammed monday 's vote			0
in a statement before the @entity0 announced it was cutting funding , @entity305 said , " today 's reckless action by @entity3 is anti-israel and anti-peace			0
it rewards the @entity8 leadership 's dangerous scheme to bypass negotiations with @entity107 and seek recognition of a self - declared ' @entity8 state , ' and takes us further from peace in the @entity18			1
" " existing @entity1 law mandates that we cut off funding to any @entity5 body that approves such a request			0
the administration must stop trying to find ways not to fully implement this law , and instead cut off funding to @entity3 immediately , " she said			0
" and @entity329 must pass pending @entity5 reform legislation to cut off funding to any @entity5 entity that grants any upgraded status to ' @entity13			1
' such strong action is the only way to deter other @entity5 bodies from following in @entity3 's footsteps , and to prevent @entity1 taxpayer dollars from paying for biased entities at the @entity5 "			1
