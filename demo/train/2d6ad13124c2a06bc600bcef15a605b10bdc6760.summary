-- @entity4 schools superintendent @entity2 has told the @entity6 district to stop teaching its controversial @entity7 or face losing $ 15 million in annual state aid under a new law , he said tuesday			1
@entity2 told @entity0 he was backing this week 's decision by exiting state superintendent @entity13 giving the state 's second largest district 60 days to comply with a new 2011 law banning certain ethnic studies programs in public schools			1
@entity13 is now @entity4 's new attorney general , and @entity2 was sworn in monday as the newly elected @entity4 schools superintendent			1
the new schools law is the latest controversy in a state already roiled by an immigration crackdown law , known as @entity26 , that is being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court			2
the @entity4 - @entity30 border is considered the nation 's busiest for illegal immigration			1
@entity6 school board member @entity33 charged that the new law provided no due process and was unconstitutional			1
she said the new law was part of an anti-immigrant political climate in the @entity4 statehouse			2
she and @entity2 said they expected this new law to also end up in court			0
" people of color in the state of @entity4 are under attack , " @entity33 told @entity0			2
" we 're basically going from one battle to the next			0
" the law authorizes the state superintendent to stop any ethnic studies classes that promote the overthrow of the @entity52 government , promote resentment toward a race or class of people , are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals			1
in written findings monday , @entity13 said the @entity6 program violated all four criteria			2
@entity2 said the @entity6 program is " in clear violation " of the new law because they 're designed for pupils of a particular ethnic group			1
@entity6 educators who have challenged the constitutionality of the new law in court have defended the @entity7 as no different than @entity74 or native american studies classes			1
added @entity33 : " what we 're doing is teaching a course that is a history course with a @entity79 - @entity74 perspective			1
i do n't understand what is so scary about that concept			0
" @entity2 , who was a state legislator for 18 years and was the chairman of the @entity84 education committee , said he was serious about enforcing a $ 15 million - a - year penalty that both sides agree would devastate @entity6 schools , if the district does n't end the ethnic studies program			1
that penalty is 10 percent of the state 's aid to the @entity6 system , whose total operating budget is $ 450 million a year , officials said			1
" make no doubt about it			0
they should n't be under any illusion on this thing , " @entity2 told @entity0			0
" we 're going to proceed forward			0
" the @entity105 's governing board has told the state in a letter that it " supports " the classes , which it says complies with the new law			0
" @entity105 administration supports its ethnic studies programs , and we are encouraged by the real and lasting impact that these programs provide to all @entity105 students , " the letter stated , according to the board 's website			1
also monday , @entity6 superintendent @entity118 told administrators and employees that he would n't tolerate any student walkouts protesting the state superintendent 's actions			2
@entity118 also encouraged principals to arrange a time in the school gym for students to " express their view and discuss the pros and cons of the new law in a constructive manner , " he said in a letter that was posted on the system 's website			2
" if a student leaves campus to participate in a protest or walkout , there will be consequences in accordance with school procedure and governing board policy , " @entity118 said			0
@entity2 said he observed one of @entity6 's ethnic studies classes last year			1
" when i came into a classroom , they were portraying @entity148 as a racist , " @entity2 said			0
" @entity148 was the president of the @entity150 in @entity151			0
... so they are vilifying @entity148 in this classroom , and up on the wall , they got a poster of @entity157 , and the historical record is that he helped direct the communist death camps in @entity160 by killing many dissidents			0
" we just have a lot of concerns about the classes , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 said he was going to broaden his public discussion about the @entity6 district to include how some @entity6 public schools , particularly those serving low - income minority students , are among the worst in the country			2
he said he was planning a new accountability system measuring the performance of each school district			0
" when we do our rankings and compare the data , a number of the schools in the @entity105 are among the bottom three in the nation , " @entity2 said			0
" in their failure to serve these kids academically , we see the same failure in their response to the community concerns about these ( ethnic studies ) classes , " @entity2 added			2
" i 'm a fan of @entity189 and he primarily relied on persuasion			0
i want to use the energy associated with this one issue to get the @entity105 to examine itself			0
" @entity6 's ethnic studies program , created in 1998 and initially called " @entity197 , " has been effective in reducing dropout rates among @entity200 students , as well as discipline problems , poor attendance and failure rates , teachers said			1
in october , 11 @entity6 teachers sued the state board of education and superintendent over the new law , calling it an " anti-hispanic " ban on @entity79 - @entity74 studies .			1

a new 2011 @entity4 law bans ethnic studies programs that " advocate ethnic solidarity "
the @entity6 school system has been teaching @entity79 - @entity74 studies since 1998
@entity4 's new superintendent *threatens* to *withhold* $ *15m* a year from @entity6 schools
