-- @entity2 ' return to golf proved to be short - lived when the former world no. 1 pulled out of the prestigious @entity5 after only nine holes of thursday 's opening round			1
the @entity8 was making his comeback after suffering knee and @entity12 injuries during the masters at @entity14 last month , but those problems recurred from his first shot at @entity17			1
the 35 - year - old , trying to win his first tournament since the scandal over his extra-marital affairs broke in late 2009 , sent his tee drive wide of the fairway and bogeyed the hole			0
he dropped three more shots at the fourth hole and another at the fifth , and walked off the course in @entity30 's @entity29 after a bogey at nine left him six over the card			2
injured @entity2 faces ' weeks ' on sidelines " the knee acted up and then the @entity12 followed after that and then the calf started cramping up			2
everything started getting tight , so it 's just a whole chain reaction , " @entity2 told the @entity38 's website			2
" this morning i felt fine during the warm - up , and then as i played , it progressively got worse			0
" @entity2 had been confident after playing nine holes on tuesday , his first on - course action since finishing fourth at @entity14			1
" oh yeah , the knee is much better , no doubt			0
the @entity12 is better as well			0
so i 'm here playing , " he said after that practice effort			0
woods also pulled out of the $ 9.5 million tournament last year in the final round , due to a neck injury			0
he won it for the first and only time in 2001			0
@entity5 is the most lucrative on the @entity38 and is often referred to as golf 's " fifth major " outside the masters , the @entity8 and @entity57 and the @entity58			1
the continuing injury problems mean @entity2 is battling to be fit for the second major this season , the @entity61 at @entity62 in @entity63 from june 13 - 19			1
he has been revamping his swing under the tutelage of coach @entity66 , but is still having problems with the same left knee that required surgery after he seriously injured it during his triumph at the @entity71			1
meanwhile , @entity72 claimed a one - shot lead at the @entity5 , shooting eight - under - par 64 in his opening round on thursday			1
the 30 - year - old @entity8 , seeking his second title this year and fourth @entity38 success overall , birdied his first three holes after starting at the 10th tee then gave back two shots at the par - four 14th			2
he immediately bounced back with another birdie , then an eagle three at the second preceded a run of four birdies in five holes before he bogeyed at his penultimate green			0
however , his ninth birdie at the last gave @entity72 a slim advantage over compatriot @entity87 , who won the @entity88 at @entity89 on sunday			0
veteran @entity90 shared third place with fellow @entity8 @entity92 after both shot 66 , while world no. 2 @entity94 was tied for fifth on 67 with @entity61 champion @entity96 , @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99			1
world no. 3 @entity101 was in a big group tied for 13th on 69 , while fourth - ranked @entity104 was back in 44th after a 71 .			2

@entity2 withdraws from @entity5 after only nine holes
former world no. 1 was six shots over the card after struggling from his opening shot
@entity8 had returned to action for the first time since the masters early last month
he has problems with same left knee that required major surgery in 2008
