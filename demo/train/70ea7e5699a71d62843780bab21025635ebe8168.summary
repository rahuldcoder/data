for several days after receiving a letter from the @entity3 president rejecting his plea for clemency , @entity0 could n't paint			1
" i felt really sorry for him , " said award - winning @entity8 artist @entity7 , who has been mentoring @entity9 , a convicted drug smuggler , in @entity11 's @entity10 since late 2011			1
" but i also said , ' @entity0 , what are you doing ? are you just going to sit around and wait for this ? you 've got nothing else to do , go back to work and start making paintings			2
' " so he did			0
in the last week or so , @entity0 has thrown himself into his painting and the prison art classes he set up and leads five days a week			0
he knows that in the days or weeks ahead , he could be led out of his cell with @entity23 , his co-conspirator in a failed 2005 drug plot , blindfolded and shot by an @entity3 firing squad			1
the men , now aged 33 and 31 , can only wait and hope that a final legal bid succeeds in saving their lives			1
later this week , the men 's @entity3 lawyers hope to file what 's known as a @entity32 to request a second judicial review			1
@entity8 lawyer @entity34 said there 's a " strong basis " for another review to be granted			1
" the first @entity32 was filed four years ago and was eventually rejected , however , so the next step was the clemency process under the clemency law and the constitution , " @entity34 said			1
however , he said that while the matter was being considered by the offices of the previous and current president , the law changed to allow for a second judicial review			1
he said , " it 's not appropriate to file a second judicial review while the matter is sitting with the president			2
now , that the letters from the president have rejected clemency , that enables the second judicial review to be brought on			1
" lawyers will be pointing to evidence of the men 's rehabilitation in prison			2
during their time behind bars , they 've said to have become respected inmates who have built a support network for others around them			0
" they 're both behaving in a very dignified way , " @entity34 said , who visited them in prison as recently as wednesday morning			0
" they 're looking after their families who are visiting and they 're both working hard on the same things they 've been doing for years ; @entity74 running an art class and @entity23 running a prayer service			0
" president @entity77 has made it clear he wo n't be stepping in to save the pair -- the only two of the drug gang known as the @entity82 who were sentenced to death			1
@entity77 told @entity6 's @entity85 earlier this week , " every day we have 50 people die because of narcotics , of drugs			1
in one year , it 's 18,000 people who die because of narcotics			0
we are not going to compromise for drug dealers			2
" the last time @entity7 visited @entity96 in his prison art class , he said the talented painter had already worked out a succession plan so the classes would continue without him			0
" last time i felt like he wasted an hour with me just talking through the logistics about how the classes would run if he 's gone , which was very upsetting , " @entity7 said			0
" he pointed out to me in the class quietly who the strong artists were , with the most future in the art practice			0
" and he also introduced me to the two young @entity3 men who he 's basically mentoring to take over his role if he 's gone			1
" last weekend , the families of both men made a public appeal for their lives to be spared			2
" i 'm confident that if ( the @entity3 president ) knows what they 've done and how much they have changed , i 'm sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed , " @entity0 's mother , @entity118 , said tearfully			1
the men were arrested in @entity11 in 2005 after @entity126 told @entity3 authorities that they 'd received a tip - off			1
four couriers with heroin strapped to the bodies were arrested with @entity23 as they tried to leave @entity3			2
@entity0 was detained in a @entity133 hotel with three others who had been enlisted as mules			0
on thursday night , a candlelight vigil organized by @entity7 will be held in @entity138 's @entity137 as a show of support for the two prisoners			0
musicians will perform in a concert called " @entity144			0
" @entity7 said it 's not an attempt to convince the @entity3 authorities to spare them -- " that 's out of my hands " -- but a personal tribute to his friend , and to show @entity0 that he and @entity23 are not alone			2
" it seemed like there was a very dark inevitability about what was going to happen to @entity0			0
and i thought , what can i do ? " " i thought i can actually show the boys that there are people who care for them , just to give them a sense of dignity , i guess			0

final legal *challenge* to be filed to save @entity8 on death row in @entity3
supporters say the convicted drug smugglers are changed men who *deserve* a second chance
