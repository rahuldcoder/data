-- voters in @entity2 have elected a new president , but it remained in question monday whether the international community would recognize conservative candidate @entity7			1
@entity9 's legitimacy remains in doubt because sunday 's elections were held under the rule of interim president @entity13 , who assumed power after a june 28 coup ousted president @entity16			1
many nations said before the election they would withhold recognition if @entity16 were not returned to power			1
the @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 said they would recognize @entity9			1
@entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 said they would not			1
@entity16 , who had called for an election boycott that apparently failed , said he would not recognize the results			2
the @entity22 on monday urged @entity2 to take the next steps toward resolving the crisis , such as having the nation 's @entity35 vote on whether to restore @entity16 to power			1
that vote was one of the provisions of a pact that representatives for @entity16 and @entity13 signed in late october			2
" while the election is a necessary one , it is not a sufficient one , " said @entity43 , the assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs			2
the @entity48 has not made the election results official , but the vote showed that opposition @entity50 candidate @entity9 defeated @entity51 of the @entity52			1
@entity16 and @entity13 are @entity52 members , and their rift splintered the party and may have hurt @entity51			2
@entity9 vowed monday to bring the divided nation back together			1
" nobody wins with this situation , " he said in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity58			2
it 's unjust to maintain a polarized country			0
" @entity9 said monday he had not talked with @entity16 but had indicated earlier he was willing to meet with the deposed president			1
@entity16 , who had been flown to @entity24 on the day of the coup , has been staying at the @entity27 embassy in @entity2 ' capital since returning secretly to the country september 21			1
asked if he would meet with @entity16 , @entity9 said , " i will do all that is necessary to bring peace to @entity2			1
" some analysts say @entity9 has little choice , given the isolation @entity2 has been under since the coup			1
" @entity7 will probably move to create a unity government and grant @entity16 political amnesty in order to end the political conflict following @entity16 's ouster , " said @entity74 , an analyst for the @entity76 consulting firm			1
@entity9 's victory sunday was a political redemption			1
he narrowly lost the presidential election to @entity16 in november 2005 , winning 46 percent of the vote			0
" four years is a short time , " he said jubilantly at his victory speech early monday			0
@entity16 supporters said this year that @entity9 was one of four presidential candidates who supported the coup			1
@entity9 , whose name means " wolf " in @entity28 , has an easy and toothy smile and intense eyes			1
he turns 62 later this month , has been a member of @entity35 since 1990 and was its president from 2002 to 2006			2
he earned a bachelor 's degree in business administration from the @entity102			0
" i am a simple type , originally from @entity106 , @entity107 , " he says on his @entity104 page			0
" i am of few words but much action			0
my parents inculcated in me a love for work since i was very young			0
i have been a cattleman , a farmer , a businessman			0
" in addition to the presidency , at stake in sunday 's election were three vice presidencies , 128 congressional seats and posts for mayor and other municipal seats			0
the other three presidential candidates were @entity123 of the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , @entity125 of the @entity126 ( cd ) and @entity128 of the @entity129 ( @entity130 )			0
a sixth candidate , @entity131 , withdrew in early november			0
the @entity22 issued a statement sunday , commending @entity2 for the election			1
" turnout appears to have exceeded that of the last presidential election , " the statement said			0
" this shows that given the opportunity to express themselves , the @entity2 people have viewed the election as an important part of the solution to the political crisis in their country			0
" the @entity150 , the @entity147 , the @entity148 and most nations -- including the @entity22 -- had condemned the coup over the summer and demanded that @entity16 be reinstated immediately			1
it looked like a solution to the crisis had been reached october 29 , when @entity16 and @entity13 agreed to a deal brokered by the @entity22			1
the pact said @entity35 would vote on whether to reinstate @entity16 to power after consultation with the nation 's @entity159 and other bodies			1
that vote is scheduled for this week			0
the @entity159 ruled last week that @entity16 could not return to office without first facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits			0
the @entity159 had ruled that the vote was illegal and @entity35 had forbidden it			0
the coup came on the day that the term - limits vote was to have been held			2
@entity13 and his supporters have insisted that @entity16 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup			1
some leaders of large @entity177 countries , particularly those that have been ruled under dictatorships in recent years , are concerned that allowing the election results to stand could embolden other " adventurers " to try to stage coups			0
@entity26 president @entity185 said monday the election was " a mockery " carried out " in the most absolute illegality , " the state - run @entity183 news agency reported			1
@entity26 was ruled by a right - wing dictatorship from 1976 to 1983			2
@entity13 stepped down temporarily last week to try to distance himself from sunday 's elections			0
