-- the unsavory issue of racism in @entity4 football could be tested like never before following the news that former @entity7 international @entity6 is to take charge of @entity9			1
even though @entity9 has yet to formally confirm his appointment , the 37 - year - old is in line to become the first black manager in @entity14 in nearly two decades			1
the last black coach to guide a leading @entity4 side was @entity18 @entity17 , who took joint control of @entity20 in the 1994 - 95 season alongside @entity22			1
@entity6 announced his appointment at a news conference in @entity18 while simultaneously retiring as a player following a stellar career -- with @entity28 's @entity27 proving to be the well - traveled midfielder 's last club			1
" all the experience i have gained in this year and a half at @entity27 is going to help me in my next venture , which will be as coach of @entity9 , " @entity6 told reporters in @entity18 on tuesday			1
he takes the @entity9 job despite boasting no previous coaching experience			0
the former @entity40 and @entity41 star 's agent said a two - and - a - half - year contract has been signed to replace @entity43 , who was fired on monday following a dismal run of results			2
at the halfway stage of the @entity14 season , the seven - time @entity47 champions stand eleventh in the table -- six points off the relegation zone and a worrying 30 behind league leaders @entity54			0
@entity6 , who won two @entity55 and two @entity14 titles with @entity9 as a player , must not only try to arrest the team 's worrying slump but also run the potential gauntlet of racism in a country whose football has been plagued by it in recent times			1
in 2013 alone , leading sides @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 were all sanctioned following racial abuse by their own supporters			0
the incident that attracted the biggest headlines came twelve months ago as @entity72 led @entity9 in a walk - off after the @entity75 international was subjected to racist abuse in a friendly against lower - tier side @entity78			2
@entity54 president @entity79 recently told @entity0 that @entity4 was some 40 years behind a country such as @entity81 in terms of its attitude towards black people			0
however , @entity6 had more immediate challenges to wrestle with as he took a phone call from @entity9 chairman @entity88 on monday			2
" the call came in the middle of the training session			0
obviously , it 's a place where i spent 10 years of my life and i have a very close relationship with the president so when he asked me i could n't say no , " explained the @entity7 , who said he pondered overnight the wrench of retiring from playing			2
" after 22 years , it was a difficult night			0
but i am very satisfied with what i 've done in my career			0
" the powerful midfielder made his debut for local side @entity41 way back in 1992 , prior to joining a host of @entity105 's top sides : @entity106 , @entity40 , @entity67 and @entity9			1
during this time , he became the first man to win @entity55 titles with three different clubs - triumphing with @entity41 in 1995 , @entity40 in 1998 and @entity9 in both 2003 and 2007			2
in 2012 , he left @entity9 to join @entity27 as the veteran @entity7 international sampled football outside of @entity105 for the first time in his career -- going on to further embellish his trophy cabinet with a @entity28 league crown			1
his displays helped @entity27 qualify for the @entity118 for the first time in 17 years , as one of @entity18 's most famous clubs finally returned to form			0
@entity122 return on tuesday , a man with over 400 appearances for the @entity9 rejected the idea that he would find it difficult to lead players alongside whom he once lined up			1
" being in charge of former teammates wo n't cause a problem -- on the contrary , i know them , " said a man chosen above former striker @entity129 , with @entity9 's youth coach having been linked with the job			1
" i am very happy to have this dream chance to go back			0
" the @entity139 - born star had reportedly been working on his coaching badges while in @entity18 and will need all his years of experience to turn around a club that has lost the likes of @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity6 himself in recent years			0
the trio were all part of @entity9 's last @entity149 , delivered by @entity43 in his maiden season in charge in 2010 - 2011			1
@entity6 must now improve the 18 - time @entity4 champions ' chronic form , with the likes of @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 having won just five of their 19 league games this season			0
next month , a man who once dominated the @entity55 on the pitch must negotiate his first match in charge as @entity9 meet high - flying @entity165 @entity164 in the @entity166 .			0
