, no one dares to argue in favor of gender - based salary discrimination			1
no one , that is , except for " pro-family " activist @entity9 , who has made a long career of telling women their place is in the home			1
in case you 're not familiar with @entity9 , she 's a veteran right - wing activist and founder 44 years ago of the @entity19 , a conservative interest group that , among other things , opposes abortion , vaccines and working mothers			1
on tuesday in the @entity24 , @entity9 declared that equal pay is bad , widening the wage gap is good and that the entire institution of marriage depends on men continuing to earn more than women			1
providing women with equal pay for equal work , she wrote , would lower their chances of finding a " suitable mate , " since , as @entity9 argues , women prefer to marry men who earn more than they do while men prefer to marry women who earn less			1
but do they ? or is it that neither gender has had very many choices to the contrary ? talking about the salary gap between partners is the least romantic thing in marriages			2
but the truth is that women have long married men who earned more than they did for one main reason : men have long earned more than women			0
it 's not about desire			0
@entity9 says that " men do n't have the same preference for a higher - earning mate			1
" maybe that 's because until very recently , the chances that men meet higher - earning women were pretty rare			2
@entity9 does n't stop there , though			2
she argues that beyond the case for " saving marriage , " women do n't actually deserve equal pay because they " work fewer hours per day , per week , per year			1
" while men work more than women in paid work , women work more than men if you account for unpaid work			0
she goes on saying that women " place a much higher value on pleasant working conditions : a clean , comfortable , air - conditioned office with congenial co-workers " -- as if @entity82 and friends to eat lunch with were not things that men like as well			2
she also ignores the reality that professional men and women do not receive equal treatment or consideration in the workplace			2
women earn less than men -- about 84 cents to men 's dollar			0
although @entity9 proposes that the best way to empower women is to make job prospects better for men , that only works -- if it works at all -- for women who are able , or want , to marry			1
what about the rest of them ? what about other choices ? simply put , even if every @entity109 man and woman wanted to marry , there are more women than men			0
@entity9 's math does n't add up			1
she also says , " suppose the pay gap between men and women were magically eliminated			0
if that happened , simple arithmetic suggests that half of women would be unable to find what they regard as a suitable mate			0
" that is , the more men that out - earn women , the more men there are from which those women might choose			0
reducing opportunity and financial independence for women does not empower them			1
in fact , the result is quite the opposite			0
of course , @entity9 's latest manifesto is n't about making logical arguments			1
she has long been known for courting controversy with her anti-feminism , anti-liberalism , anti-equal rights advocacy -- it 's no surprise that she 'd latch onto equal pay to further her own platform			1
the truth is that a more likely deterrent to marriage is the higher tax burdens that married couples face			0
under current tax codes , two - wage earning couples face higher taxes if they marry			0
this might be tolerable for middle class couples but is less so for those who earn less			0
economically speaking , there 's greater incentive for young couples of modest means to forgo marriage entirely in favor of what @entity9 might regard as ( gasp ! ) living in sin			2
@entity9 's message is immensely disempowering for women , but what else would we come to expect from a woman who has made a career of telling women that their place is at home ? perhaps more importantly , @entity9 's just got the whole " what women want " thing all wrong			1
studies show that women are increasingly marrying men who are less educated and who earn less , too			0
could it be that these women are just taking what they can get ? or could it be that there 's a new norm in town ?			0

conservative activist @entity9 says equal pay is bad for women
@entity193 : her case that equal pay hurts women 's odds of marrying is *flawed*
@entity193 says reducing financial independence for women does n't empower them
we need to reduce gender - based salary discrimination , @entity193 says
