@entity1 @entity0 used to make crowds cheer as a rising @entity5 star on the gridiron			2
now , both fans and foes will again be focused on @entity0 as he steps into the courtroom to go on trial on murder and weapons charges			1
jury selection begins friday , as attorneys begin to whittle down a pool of more than 1,100 potential jurors to the small group that will decide whether @entity0 is guilty of murdering semipro football player @entity18			1
that pool is about 10 times larger than usual , largely because of concerns over finding an impartial jury			0
attorneys will select 18 jurors , including six alternates			2
@entity0 , 25 , has pleaded not guilty			2
his friends @entity26 and @entity27 have also been charged with murder in @entity18 's death			1
they have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately			0
@entity0 's downward spiral so far , the state 's evidence against @entity0 , partially laid out in pretrial hearings , appears to be largely circumstantial			1
a magistrate previously described it as " very strong			0
" but it could be stronger			0
in the months leading up to jury selection , @entity0 's defense attorneys , who insist @entity0 will be exonerated , have been trying to chip away at the prosecution 's case			1
@entity0 's legal team , led by @entity42 , @entity43 , and @entity44 , has won some important rulings			1
@entity18 's texts to his sister : for example , the jury wo n't hear about text messages between the victim , @entity18 , and his younger sister , sent just minutes before @entity18 's death			1
the judge has blocked them			0
at about 3:20 a.m. on june 17 , 2013 , prosecutors say , @entity18 was in a car driven by @entity0 with @entity26 and @entity27			1
at 3:07 a.m. , according to prosecutors , @entity18 texted his sister @entity59 a question : " u saw who i 'm with ( ? ) " her phone was off , which delayed her response			1
at 3:22 a.m. , @entity18 texted , " @entity5			2
" a minute later , at 3:23 a.m. he sent his last text , " just so u know			0
" minutes later , witnesses heard shots fired at an industrial park about a mile from @entity0 's home , they told prosecutors			1
but superior court judge @entity73 ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant @entity18 feared for his life , legally called " a dying declaration			2
" the defense has argued the messages are innocuous , suggesting @entity18 could have been bragging about being with @entity0			1
some legal experts are surprised those texts were ruled inadmissible			0
" they appear relevant , " said @entity84 law professor @entity83			0
" they signal what the victim was thinking before he was killed and they arguably refer to the defendant as well , " he added			0
if they had been admitted , @entity83 said , the defense and prosecution could have debated the meaning and let the jurors weigh the arguments @entity0 's texts to @entity18 : jurors will , however , be able to see texts between @entity0 and @entity18 from earlier that night when the football player invited @entity18 to hang out			1
who 's who in the case against @entity0 the weapon : it 's never been found			2
that could be a problem for jurors			0
in court papers , prosecutors have suggested the gun may have been thrown away by @entity0 's fiancee , @entity110			1
she 's on the prosecution witness list but has denied any knowledge of the weapon , believed to be a .45 - caliber handgun , according to documents			0
she has been accused of lying to a grand jury and has pleaded not guilty to the perjury charge			0
the surveillance video : prosecutors will be able to show @entity0 on his home surveillance video system walking toward his basement door holding what prosecutors say appears to be a gun			1
the authorities say the video was recorded shortly after he returned home the night in question , minutes after witnesses reported hearing gunshots in the industrial park			2
investigators say a vehicle that appears to match the description of a car rented by @entity0 is seen on security cameras driving through the industrial park , allegedly with @entity0 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity18 inside			1
but it 's unclear who fired the fatal shots			0
at this point , prosecutors have not publicly presented their theory			0
was it @entity0 , @entity26 or @entity27 , or some combination ? prosecutors have said they plan to argue @entity18 's murder was a " joint venture			1
" under @entity151 state law , prosecutors do n't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger			0
under joint venture , says @entity158 , " anyone who actively participates in the murder can be held guilty for murder			0
" the law will be explained to jurors , but will the state present enough evidence to prove it ? as late as november , with the trial around the corner , the state was still looking for more proof			2
in a surprising move , investigators got a warrant to search @entity0 's home again , more than a year after their last entry			1
in court papers , detectives said they were looking for three pairs of sneakers photographed in a closet during their original 2013 search			0
they said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where @entity18 was fatally shot			2
but detectives left empty - handed			0
the shoes were not there			0
one of the unanswered questions : why were n't the shoes seized during the original search ? other accusations : prosecutors also wo n't be able to bring up other accusations against @entity0			2
for example , if former @entity0 friend @entity189 testifies , he wo n't be able to mention he 's suing @entity191 for allegedly shooting him in the right eye a few months before @entity18 's death			1
the shooting is inadmissible , @entity73 ruled			0
nor will the jury be able to hear that @entity0 has been indicted for shooting to death two men in @entity198 after leaving a nightclub in 2012			2
he 's pleaded not guilty in that case , too , and the trial is pending			2
@entity73 ruled that the @entity189 shooting in @entity203 and the @entity198 double slaying are far too prejudicial and that @entity18 's case must stand on its own			1
will a show and tell help ? prosecutors have permission from the judge to take jurors to see @entity0 's home , as well as the shooting site			1
they will also be shown the location of some cell phone towers			0
prosecutors suggest cell tower " pings " could connect @entity0 to the scene of @entity18 's death			1
inside @entity0 's home , jurors will see the layout and its multicamera video security system			1
@entity73 ruled that a trophy case and @entity225 jersey inside the home will remain in view			0
the prosecution had requested the memorabilia be covered up or removed so jurors could n't be swayed by @entity0 's celebrity			1
but first , a jury must be chosen			0
how hard will it be to find 18 people , including alternates , who can put aside whatever opinions they might have and view the evidence with open minds ? with @entity0 and his family watching , as well as the family and friends of victim @entity18 , we 're about to find out			1
@entity2 's @entity243 and @entity244 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 is going on trial , charged with murder in the shooting death of of @entity18
prosecutors can not tell jurors about texts from victim to his sister shortly before his death
prosecutors can take jurors to @entity0 's home and the slaying site
