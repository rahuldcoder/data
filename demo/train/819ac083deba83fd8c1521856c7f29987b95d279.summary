-- more than three out of every 10 smartphone owners do n't have a password on the device that could give easy access to their e-mail , bank account , credit card information and other sensitive info			1
that 's one of the findings of a recent worldwide survey by web security company @entity14			1
on top of that , 15 % of people surveyed said they save password information on their phones to apps and websites they use and more than half ( 55 % ) who do have passwords said they 've shared those passwords with others			1
" the unfortunate reality is that everyone loses things , and our devices can get stolen , " @entity29 , an identity - theft specialist at @entity14 , wrote in a blog post about the findings			1
" and when that happens to your smartphone or tablet , it can be devastating			0
" in all , 36 % of respondents said they do n't have a phone password			2
and women are slightly less likely to password - protect their phones			1
some 54 % of those who said they do n't were women			2
guys are n't blameless , though			0
out of all the respondents who said they " hide " passwords to websites and apps in the @entity53 app on their phone , 62 % were men			0
" many of us use upwards of 10 apps on our devices during a typical week , " @entity29 wrote			2
" the majority of these apps are logged into our most critical accounts including e-mail , text , banking , social media , payment apps and others that are linked to our credit cards			0
" and because mobile app developers know that we are more apt to use their programs if they are easy to access and convenient to use , a lot of apps are programmed to automatically keep you logged in for days , weeks , months or until you manually revoke access			0
" he offered some basic tips for protecting data on your phone			0
among them : -- password - protect all your devices and do n't use easy ones such as " 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 " or " 1 - 1 - 1 - 1			1
" -- never use the " remember me " function on sensitive apps or your web browser and remember to log out of those apps when you 're done with them			1
-- consider not sharing your password , even with family members			0
" this might be a tough one , " he concedes			0
-- predictably , use a mobile security product -- such as @entity14 's .			2

survey : three out of 10 of us say that we do n't password - protect our phones
@entity14 security says more than half have shared their password with others
*advice* : never use the " remember me " function on apps , web browser
