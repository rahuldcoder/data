another member of state - funded @entity1 made waves on wednesday -- not by standing behind @entity3 , as the news network is wont to do , but by bucking it			1
from the anchor chair , @entity6 closed a show -- as seen in video which she later tweeted -- talking about the " ethical and moral challenges " she faces working for @entity1 , also known as @entity1 she spoke of being from a family who fled to @entity14 to escape @entity16 forces during the 1956 @entity18 revolution , being the daughter of a @entity21 military veteran and being the partner of a physician who works at a @entity21 military base			1
" and that is why , personally , i can not be part of a network funded by the @entity26 government that whitewashes the actions of @entity25 , " @entity6 said , referring to @entity26 president @entity25			1
" i 'm proud to be an @entity21 and believe in disseminating the truth , " she added			2
" and that is why , after this newscast , i 'm resigning			0
" not that she would 've necessarily lasted much longer , after her comments			0
in a statement , @entity1 said , " when a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization , the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor , and , if they can not be resolved , to quit like a professional			0
" " but when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision , it is nothing more than a self - promotional stunt , " said the network			0
talking wednesday night to @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity6 said the idea she did this " for personal gain ... could n't be farther from the truth			1
" she said she 'd " hesitated to speak on this for a while for fear of repercussion , " but decided to act now based on her belief " the propagandist nature of @entity1 ( had come ) out in full force " over its coverage of the @entity68 crisis			0
" rt is not about the truth ; it 's about promoting a @entity71 agenda , " @entity6 told @entity54			1
" and i can tell you firsthand , it 's about bashing @entity14			1
" @entity6 , who characterizes herself as a @entity76 - @entity75 and @entity14 correspondent on her @entity78 feed , became the second personality from @entity1 to defiantly , publicly challenge the government that effectively signs their paychecks			1
her resignation announcement did n't explicitly mention the crisis in @entity68 , though she mentioned it later in her @entity54 interview			0
backed by @entity89 diplomats , officials in that eastern @entity87 nation claim that @entity26 troops have violated their sovereignty by effectively invading the @entity93 peninsula			2
@entity25 , meanwhile , has denied sending any more of his country 's troops into the country , or that any of the up to 25,000 troops who are stationed there have played any part in the standoff , according to the state - run @entity102 news agency			1
but that situation is central to @entity1 's coverage , which leans toward @entity3 's point of view			2
on wednesday , for instance , its website featured stories with headlines such as " @entity112 snipers hired by @entity114 leaders , " " ' @entity116 stereotypes ' : @entity26 condemns @entity118 plan " and " questions on @entity68 the @entity89 chooses not to answer			0
" two days ago , another @entity1 personality -- @entity121 -- referred directly to " @entity26 's military occupation of @entity93 " while seemingly going off this @entity124 script at the end of her " @entity127 " program			1
news anchor : ' what @entity26 did is wrong ' " i ca n't stress enough how strongly i am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation 's affairs , " said @entity130 , a @entity131 native who , like @entity6 , is based in @entity132			1
" what @entity26 did is wrong			0
" while @entity130 refused to " defend military aggression , " she did n't leave @entity1 in fact , she returned to the air the following night and was n't even reprimanded , according to the network			1
as @entity1 noted in a statement , @entity130 called it " kind of a sad commentary that " -- while she 's regularly spoken out against military intervention -- " my only criticism of @entity26 's actions was picked up " by the media			1
on wednesday night , @entity6 said she 'd recently become upset over portions of one of her interviews being cut , what she called a " very dangerous " segment on neo-nazi elements among the @entity68 opposition and " very , very loaded " questions being planted by @entity1 's management			1
" i felt that i could no longer work here and go on television and tell the @entity21 people that this is what 's happening and have it pose as news , " @entity6 said			2
" it 's something that i do n't feel comfortable with			0
" leaked call raises questions about who was behind sniper attacks in @entity68 both @entity6 and @entity130 's remarks shined a spotlight on what exactly @entity1 is -- in terms of its purpose and its viewpoint , especially for its @entity21 - based , @entity175 - language programming			1
the @entity26 foreign ministry 's website points to the network as a top media source			2
and the @entity180 says it is best " known as an extension of former president @entity25 's confrontational foreign policy			0
" in its statement on @entity130 , the network said that " rt journalists and hosts are free to express their own opinions			2
" what makes @entity130 's comments different from those of @entity6 , according to @entity1 , is that the former " spoke in the context of her own talk show , to the viewers who have been tuning in for years to hear her opinions on current events , the opinions that most media did not care about until two days ago			1
" " for years , ms. @entity121 , has been speaking out against @entity21 military intervention only to be ignored by the mainstream news outlets , " @entity1 added			2
" but with that one comment , branded as an act of defiance , she became an overnight sensation			0
" the network then seemed to suggest that @entity6 -- who cheered @entity130 as " my girl " after her commentary -- paid attention to all the hoopla			2
" it is a tempting example to follow , " @entity1 said			0
@entity6 said many who do follow the lead of network management -- the senior members of which are in @entity3 -- are young , " inexperienced " and " eager to please " their bosses			0
" eventually , you learn what management likes , what management dislikes , " she said			0
" ... they kind of make sure the narrative is delivered in one way or another			0
" @entity228 : how @entity68 is divided			0

@entity6 says @entity1 is about " promoting a @entity71 agenda , " bashing @entity14 "
@entity6 quits state - funded rt on - air , saying she believes in " disseminating the truth "
fellow rt personality @entity121 had *slammed* " @entity26 's military occupation of @entity93 "
but @entity130 is still with @entity1 , having made her remarks " in the context of her own ... show "
