-- last week world no. 1 @entity1 wanted to win this year 's @entity2 to complete his collection of grand slam titles , now he wants the trophy for a more pressing reason -- to honor the death of his " second mother "			1
@entity10 , who coached @entity1 for five years from when he was just six , died on saturday			1
the potential impact of the 77 - year - old 's death on her @entity15 compatriot was deemed to be so great that @entity1 's management team kept the news from him until after he had beaten @entity18 in saturday 's third round			1
@entity1 's reaction backed up their assessment as the 26 - year - old canceled his post-match news conference , issuing an apology to the media as he did so			1
on monday , he paid tribute to his mentor shortly after seeing off @entity29 4 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4 to reach this year 's quarterfinals at @entity2			1
" she 's one of the most incredible people i ever knew , " he told reporters			2
" @entity10 was my first coach and was like my second mother			1
" we were very close throughout my whole life and she taught me a lot of things that are part of me , part of my character today			2
i have the nicest memories of her and these will stay with me forever			2
" i think it was the right thing to give me the news after the match ( against @entity18 ) , " he added			2
" regardless of the timing , it was still a shock			0
" a beaten finalist in @entity50 last year -- when he lost out to @entity2 record breaker @entity51 -- @entity1 last saw @entity10 in february , shortly before the start of the @entity54			1
yet his last conversation with a woman who also helped develop the talents of grand slam champions @entity59 and @entity60 came far more recently			0
" i remember the last conversation we had two weeks ago about @entity2 , and she told me , ' listen , you have to focus , you have to give your attention to this tournament			1
this is a tournament you need to win			0
' " she was giving me this kind of inspiration and motivation even more			0
so now i feel in her honor that i need to go all the way			0
" but it 's not about me only			2
there are so many great players still around in the tournament			0
it gives me that inner strength to push even harder			0
" in a recent interview , @entity10 said she spotted @entity1 's potential almost from the moment she first met him in @entity83			1
" when i met him i knew immediately that he was different			0
i told his father that he was an exceptional talent and that one day he will be a big champion , " said a woman who represented the former state of @entity87 at both tennis and handball			0
after he won @entity92 for the first -- and to date -- only time in 2011 , @entity1 visited @entity10 as part of his celebrations			1
and the world number one says @entity10 , who was recently battling breast cancer , has inspired him to work with young tennis players in the future			1
" she was 77 years old , and before she passed away two days ago , last week she was giving lessons to kids , " he said			0
" i hope to follow on from where she stopped			0
she gave so much knowledge and i feel i have a responsibility to carry on that work			0
" she never married , never had children			0
she was dedicated to tennis , the kids and coaching			0
" " i know that her spirit will be always with me and always on the tennis court , because this is what she always loved to do			0
it 's her favorite place in the world and i 'll make sure that her legacy continues			1
" if the @entity15 is to provide his perfect send - off for @entity10 by winning @entity2 for the first time - and thus become only the eighth man to achieve the career grand slam - he must first beat @entity119 , who is also chasing history			1
when the number 12 seed beat @entity124 's @entity123 , the @entity121 became the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals of a grand slam since @entity128 in 2005 and the oldest to do so in @entity50 since 1971			1
once ranked number two in the world , @entity119 , 35 , missed the entirety of the 2013 season after twice undergoing should surgery -- but is now one of four players over 30 in the quarterfinals along with @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
" i think we all just are smarter about how we train , about how we eat , about how we do recovery , " he said			0
" the physical and fitness areas have improved a lot in sports in general			0
i think that 's why you see maybe more people also in the early , mid- 30s doing well			2
" at least one man over the age of 30 will reach the semifinals , since @entity138 and @entity139 meet in the quarters , while @entity137 will take on local hope @entity154 , a relative strapling at the age of 28			2
age was also on the minds of those watching @entity51 on monday , with the @entity50 crowd singing ' @entity162 ' to a man who celebrated his 27th birthday in style			1
bidding to become the first man in tennis history to win eight titles at the same major championship , @entity51 won 6 - 4 6 - 1 6 - 3 against 13th seed @entity170 , the first @entity172 man in the fourth round since @entity174 in 1938			1
" it 's a very special moment , " said @entity51 of the crowd 's decision to break into song			1
" @entity170 is a great player and he is getting better every season			2
but today i think i played my best match of the tournament			0
" @entity51 will play @entity182 in the quarterfinals after the @entity184 beat @entity186 @entity185 in a thrilling match , with the ninth seed rallying from two sets down to win 6 - 7 4 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 5 8 - 6 .			2

@entity119 makes history as oldest @entity2 quarterfinalist since 1971
@entity51 is *serenaded* on 27th birthday by @entity50 crowd as he beats @entity172 's @entity170
