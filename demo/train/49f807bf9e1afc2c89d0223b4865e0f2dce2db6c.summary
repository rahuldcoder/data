-- i had many conversations with @entity3 , although i had not met him			1
in my family 's tiny shack in @entity9 's @entity8 slum , my one - way exchanges with the great man kept me going			1
@entity3 survived 27 years of prison ; maybe i would make it out , too			1
@entity3 became @entity14 's first black president in 1994 , when i was 10 years old			1
in @entity8 , people celebrated and talk circulated the streets about this man , but i did n't see how his story connected to mine until much later			1
i was struggling too hard simply to survive			2
at 10 , i was on and off the streets			1
i flitted from house to house , unable to live at home with my mother because my stepfather had threatened to kill us both if i tried to come home			2
i knew i was born poor , and believed i was fated to die poor			1
i needed a role model , but in @entity8 , these were in short supply			2
at 16 , i felt the pressure from gangs and drugs -- while fighting the temptation to drink my misery away and to find temporary comfort with women , like i saw my friends do			1
opinion : a white @entity14 's memories of @entity3 even as the shadow of @entity45 spread , i saw no reason not to die young , because i had nothing to live for			1
our lives in the slums seemed to take a friend every day			2
police shot my friend @entity53 ; they thought he looked like a criminal			0
my childhood friend @entity55 hanged himself			0
his suicide note said what i felt : " i just ca n't take it anymore			0
" both of my sisters were raped and impregnated as teenagers			0
people seemed to fade and disappear			0
to live was the exception			0
i am now 29 , and all but two of my closest childhood friends are dead			0
it was @entity3 who saved my life			1
a visiting @entity69 gave me two books			2
i had never gone to formal schools , but i had learned to read and write with the help of a kind priest			2
the @entity69 gave me a collection of speeches by the rev. @entity76 and @entity3 's " @entity77			1
" it was @entity3 's book that spoke to me			1
i could n't put it down			0
here was someone whose life i could somehow picture			2
for the first time in my life i saw i had a choice			2
i could either submit to the degradations of poverty , to the prevailing hopelessness , or i could start my own long walk			0
i started small , using 20 cents from my pay at a factory job to buy a soccer ball			0
i organized young people to work together in an organization that has grown to include a school for girls , a health clinic and a community services project			0
this year we will serve 50,000 people			0
yet as i look at the larger structural problems of urban poverty in my country , i feel my work has just begun			0
despite my doubts and concerns , i would begin and end every day with a private conversation with @entity3			1
i 'd ask him what he 'd do when his problems seemed insurmountable			0
i shared with him my triumphs , and i read every speech of his i could find			2
but as i grew older i began to wonder about the power and perils of being a living hero			0
@entity3 was , for me and for my continent , more than a person			1
he is the emblem of progress			0
he came through poverty and struggle yet did not allow it to embitter him			0
instead he seemed emboldened by a sense of urgency			0
why @entity3 has six names my fear is that we become too comfortable with his legacy -- content with honoring what @entity3 has stood for that we forget to carry forward his sense of urgency			1
the journey to freedom in my country , @entity138 , and in @entity3 's own country , @entity14 , is far from over			1
on a recent visit to @entity141 , i spoke for an hour with three young men about the crushing challenges of their lives in one of @entity14 's burgeoning slums			2
@entity3 accomplished so much , but worldwide an ever - growing gap between rich and poor and mounting inequality threatens all for which he fought			1
i will still talk to @entity3 , and will wonder what he might do			1
how he might have organized another movement to take @entity14 forward			0
these are conversations we must all begin to have			0
we have lost him , and must recognize the need for a next generation of selfless and driven leaders			0
for me , @entity3 's example will always stand as a reminder of what is possible when conviction faces injustice , of the work that still remains unfinished , and of the long road ahead			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

at 10 , @entity167 was on and off the streets in a *sprawling* @entity9 , @entity138 , slum
he was *extremely* poor and believed he was fated to die poor -- this was his prison
@entity167 's life turned around when he read @entity3 's books and speeches
he would " speak " to @entity3 , whose *inspiration* led him to achieve , excel and help others
