@entity0 -- it may seem counterintuitive , but federal aviation officials said wednesday they will make the skies safer for air travelers not by punishing @entity7 employees who report making mistakes , but by protecting them from punishment			1
@entity7 officials announced that as part of a new " safety culture " at the agency , they would fully embrace nonpunitive reporting systems , in an effort to generate information that could expose bigger dangers			1
" make no mistake about it : we do n't condone ( errors ) , " said @entity20 , the @entity7 's chief operating officer			1
" however , we presume the good intent of our controllers and are more interested in the free flow of information than we are in punishing for errors			1
" the @entity7 took a half - step in that direction in 2008 , creating a nonpunitive reporting system for air traffic controllers			1
on wednesday , the @entity7 said it was expanding the program to employees who maintain radar installations and other systems			1
and it changed longstanding @entity7 nomenclature			2
from now on , " operational errors " -- for instance , when an air traffic controller brings two planes too close together -- will be known as " operational incidents			1
" @entity43 experiments with lighter screening of elderly the change will reduce the " stigma " associated with errors , @entity20 said , thereby increasing information and allowing the agency to make life - saving changes			1
the new system , paradoxically , will mean an increase in reported " operational incidents " in the short term , officials said			2
incident reports " will certainly go up in the next few years with all of our additional reporting systems , " @entity20 said			0
but risk will be going down , he said			0
safety advocates have long touted the benefits of nonpunitive systems , and some welcomed the @entity7 's announcement			0
" it 's a good , positive step , " said @entity66 , a former @entity7 chief of staff who now heads a consulting business in @entity0			1
" mistakes happen and we need to learn from our mistakes			0
" @entity66 said the @entity7 was correct in expanding the system to include the agency 's technicians			1
" the technicians are the forgotten part of aviation , " he said			0
" they 're the ones out there 24/7 keeping things working			0
they do n't get the attention the air traffic controllers do			1
" in announcing the new reporting systems , the @entity7 cast itself as a victim of its success			0
@entity7 officials said they used to be able to measure risk by counting accidents			1
the fewer crashes , the better the agency was doing			0
but with the commercial aviation accident rate at historically low levels -- there has not been a fatal commercial crash in three years -- the agency needs to look at other data to identify risky behaviors and incidents , and to address them			0
one measure has been " operational errors , " or instances in which controllers deviate from established protocols			0
currently , 99.9 percent of operations occur completely according to procedures , @entity20 said			0
@entity20 said the @entity7 is activating sophisticated software that will monitor operations and will bring more errors , or incidents , to light			1
the @entity7 said the voluntary reporting system for controllers has provided nearly 10 times the data during the past three years compared to the traditional reporting system			2
it also led to the @entity7 's issuing scores of corrective actions , making aviation safer in the @entity123			2
it also helped the agency to identify the top hazards , and to focus on those hazards			0
officials said there are safeguards to protect employees from abusing the nonpunitive reporting system			2
after a mistake is reported , the incident is reviewed by a three - person panel , with representatives from management , the union and an oversight organization			0
the panel can ask for additional information , launch an investigation or take other action as appropriate			0
if an error was intentional , the @entity7 can take action , officials said .			2

@entity7 officials say the agency wo n't punish any employees who report making mistakes
change will reduce " stigma " of errors , says @entity7 chief operating officer @entity20
@entity156 : " we do n't condone " errors , but " we presume the good intent of our controllers "
@entity7 is expanding a system already in force with air traffic controllers
