the car 's driver wielded a gun , apparently pointing it in the air and then at a photographer , who was following them and captured the shot , according to @entity67 it is unclear if the gun was real or fake			2
lawyers told @entity1 that @entity6 was unlikely to face charges unless it could be proved she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets , but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm if @entity11 authorities wanted to do so			1

" part of her enjoys the attention : she 's always mixed with high - society characters and she loves partying but she 's not off the rails by any means			0
" this prank in a @entity26 street will come as a real wake - up call for @entity6 , " the correspondent , who declined to be named , told @entity1			1
" she must now realize that it just takes one person waving a gun around to seriously dent her public image			0
she 'll be gutted by how badly this has reflected on the royals			0
" but the correspondent said he believed @entity26 authorities would have no choice but to investigate the incident , while @entity6 would be forced to issue a public apology			0

some think she has also been riding for a fall			0
