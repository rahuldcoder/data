@entity1 , @entity0 -- even a new , high - profile coach could n't help @entity4 figure out @entity5			1
@entity4 had n't beaten @entity5 in seven years in a grand slam -- and on a chilly night in @entity1 the world @entity7 kept the streak alive , improving his record over the @entity11 to 23 - 10 overall as he advanced to the @entity14 final			1
the @entity15 pulled out a tight first set and then cruised to a 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 3 6 - 3 victory friday to set up an encounter with @entity4 's compatriot , @entity19			1
" i played a lot of times against @entity4 , and a lot of times i played great against him , " @entity5 told reporters			1
" so probably that 's why i had this success against him			0
" if @entity5 wins sunday he would rise to 14 majors and tie @entity31 @entity30 -- in attendance at @entity33 during a rare foray to a grand slam in retirement -- for second on the men 's all - time list behind @entity4			1
the odds are heavily stacked in his favor given he is even more dominant against debutant grand slam finalist @entity19 , not losing a set in their 12 encounters			1
@entity19 progressed thursday by downing @entity47 @entity46			0
@entity4 sought the services of @entity49 in an effort to regain his old form and the 32 - year - old , troubled by his back in 2013 , duly produced big wins over former @entity14 finalist @entity55 and @entity57 champion @entity56 this fortnight			1
but @entity5 's transition from defense to offense thwarted @entity4 , as he continued to enjoy success employing his heavily spun forehand to the @entity4 backhand and he served impeccably			1
@entity5 , who won the @entity65 and @entity66 last year in a successful return from knee problems , was broken only once -- in the middle of the third set			2
blog : honor in defeat for @entity4 " playing @entity56 or @entity5 is day and night , " @entity4 told reporters			1
" it 's just every point is played in a completely different fashion and i have to totally change my game			0
" @entity49 was a serve - and - volleyer who triumphed at @entity57 twice , and @entity4 was n't afraid to approach the net			2
however , he has used the tactic in the past against @entity5 and on friday won only 55 % of net points			1
indeed @entity5 did n't think @entity4 tried much new -- saying he perused @entity83 and watched some of their 2012 @entity1 semifinal , which he also won before losing the title match to @entity88			1
" i think he tried to play very aggressive , taking the ball very early , " said @entity5			2
" but if you go to @entity83 and you see the video of the 2012 match , you will see that he was playing very , very aggressive , too , especially the beginning of the match			0
" so nothing is completely new			0
" @entity5 's passing shots left the crowd gasping , especially a forehand down the line in the final game			1
" coming into the match i thought we would have a chance today but the way the match came about , @entity5 played very , very well and @entity4 did n't have that many chances , " @entity49 told a small group of reporters			2
" playing against @entity5 at this level is very hard , " he added			0
" it was n't enough today , but i think he 's made a lot of progress over the last three months			0
" it 's looking good for the rest of the year			0
he still has a way to go before he is back to the level where he can be			0
" @entity49 said the match might have turned out differently had @entity4 broken early in the first set			0
he likely was referring to the fourth game , when @entity5 escaped a 0 - 30 hole			2
@entity5 raced to a 5 - 1 lead in the tiebreak , closed out the set and broke on his eighth chance of the match to take a 4 - 2 stranglehold in the second			2
by that time @entity5 took a medical timeout for a lingering blister on his left palm and @entity4 complained to the chair umpire -- not for the first time in his career -- about the left - hander 's grunting			1
despite the loss , @entity49 remained upbeat about @entity4 's chances of achieving an 18th major			1
" @entity4 had a tough year last year , " said @entity49			0
" at least now he feels healthy , which is no. 1			2
no. 2 he needs to put in a lot of work , which he is doing			0
" he just needs to gain a bit more momentum , a bit more confidence			0
that will come with time			0
i think in a few months you should see him even better than what we 've seen this week			0
" @entity5 , who won the tournament in 2009 but was absent last year , is doing fine at the moment .			2
