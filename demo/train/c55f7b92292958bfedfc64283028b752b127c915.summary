-- it seems everyone -- except perhaps the die - hard @entity4 fan -- agrees that the most important event scheduled for next week is the first presidential debate			1
i say " scheduled " because you never know what the news cycle will kick in			0
snickers might have a new chocolate bar			0
the pundits and politicians and the news media and the late - night comedians are salivating over the debate			1
maybe the football fans should be jealous , because the debate is being " played " like a game -- who will win , and by how much , rather than as a serious exchange of ideas or contrast of visions			1
yes , the debates are important , but the political and economic conditions of the times are probably more important			1
some debates have helped decide elections ; others have just clarified the electoral winds			1
usually , the challenger has the advantage			0
he ( and perhaps someday she ) can go on the offensive			0
being on the same stage with the president , who also has to defend his record , results in an automatic elevation of stature -- regardless of who 's taller			1
overall , an incumbent president has more to lose			1
still , whether a debate alone can win or lose an election is itself open to debate			1
every debate produces a gaffe and a few lines for the late - night comedians			1
whether that 's enough to change the momentum of a campaign is n't so clear			1
most experts agree that the very first televised debate , that between @entity58 and @entity59 in 1960 , did change the momentum and direction of that election			1
opinion : how can president @entity65 win the first debate ? @entity59 certainly learned his lesson , refusing to debate in 1968 or 1972			1
in the second presidential debate of 1976 , @entity68 of the @entity69 asked president @entity71 about the @entity73 influence in @entity74			1
@entity71 said , " there is no @entity73 domination of @entity74 , and there never will be under a @entity71 administration			0
" astounded , @entity68 gave @entity79 a chance to modify his response , but @entity79 elaborated , saying , " i do n't believe that the @entity82 consider themselves dominated by the @entity73			1
" or the @entity83 or @entity84 , he added -- two countries whose rebellions the @entity73 had crushed			0
that was a jaw - dropper , and @entity88 said the debates gave him credibility			2
but just two years earlier @entity59 resigned in disgrace and the country remained torn by the @entity94 legacy			0
so perhaps @entity79 's odd declaration only highlighted an inherent political weakness			0
in 1980 , @entity97 , thanks to several decades of acting experience , looked presidential , selling himself to the @entity101 people as he had earlier sold them @entity102			2
when @entity88 said @entity97 would cut @entity103 , @entity97 , who 'd been complaining that @entity88 had been misrepresenting him , quipped , " there you go again			0
" and he ended with the now famous , " are you better off than you were four years ago ? " but @entity88 did n't help his cause when he ended by saying he 'd asked his teenage daughter , @entity108 , to tell him the biggest issue of the day ( the answer concerned nuclear weapons )			2
and inflation was at 13.5 % , the country was in an energy crisis and the @entity116 hostage situation made @entity88 look weak			0
in 1984 , @entity97 's zinger about own age -- " i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign			1
i am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience " -- cost @entity123 the election , according to @entity123			0
but with the economy turning around and @entity97 's popular " cowboy " stance against the @entity73 apparently restoring @entity101 prestige abroad , the president already had a commanding lead in the polls before the debate			1
in 1988 , we had @entity139 ' convoluted , wooden response to a hypothetical question about whether he would impose the death penalty if someone raped and murdered his wife			0
but @entity139 was done in by @entity97 's legacy , his own pr ineptness and a " dirty tricks " campaign worthy of @entity59 ( see @entity147 )			2
in 1992 , viewers thought if anybody won the debates , it was third - party candidate @entity153 , but president @entity154 looked detached at times when he looked at his watch			1
opinion : @entity160 's laughable case for @entity161 by 1996 , the incumbent @entity157 had a commanding lead over the 73 - year - old war veteran @entity163 , who looked tired			2
given the disputed results of the 2000 cycle , it 's hard to say what impact the debates had			2
but i will never forget the expectations game			0
@entity172 , then @entity173 's chief strategist , pronounced that @entity174 was the " world 's most pre-eminent debater			0
" expectations were exceedingly high for us			0
@entity174 was prepared , but perhaps too prepared			0
he was anxious , and the split screen did n't do us any favors			2
we lost the debate on body language and sighing , not substance			2
@entity59 's revenge , i guess			0
in 2004 , @entity154 was a wartime president			2
while the challenger , sen. @entity186 , got under his skin in the first debate , @entity154 still managed to keep his cool under intense rhetorical fire			2
in 2008 , revulsion against @entity154 's economic and foreign policies , the @entity192 and the candidacy of @entity194 overshadowed the debates between @entity196 and @entity65			0
so a good debate performance or a poor one can make a difference , but conditions in the country and how voters perceive the candidates probably matter more			1
the debates this year will certainly have their moments			0
but both candidates are already so well - known , the memorable lines will probably reinforce , rather than change , voters ' perceptions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : the hype is starting for the first presidential debate *wednesday*
she says debates can make a difference but often do n't change *dynamics* of a campaign
most debates since 1980s have n't swung the elections , she says
@entity212 : an incumbent president usually has more to lose , and debates elevate challengers
