-- @entity2 's @entity1 exerted a tactical stranglehold on hosts @entity4 to earn a goalless draw in the first leg of their @entity8 semifinal tuesday			1
if the expectant capacity crowd in the @entity11 were anticipating a night of free - flowing football then they would have quickly become disillusioned as @entity2 's men restricted @entity4 to few chances			1
@entity1 , who entertain the @entity17 leaders in the return leg in @entity19 next wednesday , also had to cope with losing goalkeeper @entity20 and captain @entity21 to injury in each half , but @entity4 were unable to take full advantage			1
after central defensive lynchpin @entity21 limped off , @entity4 had their best spell with @entity27 forcing a fine save from @entity20 's veteran replacement @entity29 while @entity30 and substitute @entity31 headed wide from @entity32 crosses			1
@entity1 's @entity40 , returning to the club where he spent six successful years , cut a lone figure up front for the @entity38 side and aside from one fine run and shot had barely a sight of goal			2
@entity40 ' @entity4 counterpart , @entity43 , who has been linked with a big money move to @entity1 , was also largely frustrated aside from two late headers , the first blocked by @entity46 , the second , better chance , headed straight at the excellent @entity29			2
the 41 - year - old @entity49 told @entity50 after the draw that it had been a job well done			0
" we knew if we could match their determination , that our quality could come through			0
we did n't create too many chances , but we did a good job tonight , " he said			0
" it 's very tough for the second leg but we 've got to take each game as it comes			0
before that , we 've got a massive game at @entity64 on sunday			0
" @entity1 , who must win at league leaders @entity64 to revive fading @entity38 title hopes , will be hoping to reach a second @entity8 final in three years with their home leg against @entity4 still to come			1
but they will have to do without @entity20 , who dislocated his shoulder after falling awkwardly in tipping over an early corner , and @entity21 , who limped off in the 72nd minute			2
the bad news was confirmed by @entity2			0
" @entity20 's season over			0
do n't ask me technically , but season over , " he said			0
" and @entity21 ( @entity21 ) -- we have to play the final for him to play with us			2
" @entity1 will also be missing midfielders @entity79 and @entity81 for the second leg after picking up yellow cards , the same fate also befalling @entity4 's @entity27			1
@entity4 , who were beaten finalists to @entity86 in the 1974 final of @entity89 's premier club competition , will return to league action with a match against @entity92 sunday as they bid to hold off @entity93 and @entity94 in @entity17			1
their city rivals @entity93 play reigning title holders @entity86 in the @entity99 capital wednesday in the second semifinal of the @entity8 .			1

@entity4 and @entity1 play to scoreless draw in @entity8
few chances in semifinal first leg tie in @entity11 in @entity4
@entity1 lose @entity20 and @entity21 to injuries
@entity93 host @entity86 in second semifinal wednesday
