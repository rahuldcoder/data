@entity0 -- if you 're a @entity2 woman , the @entity2 wants you			1
to run for @entity5 , that is			2
the @entity2 holds a majority of seats in the @entity8			1
yet of 234 @entity2 members , only 19 are women			1
in an effort to boost that number , the @entity8 @entity2 campaign committee is launching " @entity14 , " a program largely led by the party 's female members designed to bring more women into the fold			1
@entity1 's chief congressional correspondent @entity20 spoke exclusively with three sitting @entity8 @entity2 female members spearheading the effort , and one @entity2 woman hoping to score a @entity8 seat			1
to a person , they recognize that at the very least , @entity2 have an image problem -- especially after studying the results of the 2012 election			2
according to @entity1 's 2012 exit polls , 55 percent of women voted for @entity32 , a stark leap over the 44 percent who voted for @entity2 candidate @entity35			2
and @entity36 made gains in both the @entity38 and the @entity8			1
" we saw that as @entity2 , even though we were talking about the issues that affected @entity45 , women across this country felt we were not connecting with them , " rep. @entity39 ( r - @entity40 ) said			2
rep. @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , serving her first congressional term , said she and her colleagues need to talk to women " in a way that 's going to make their life better and easier			0
" " you know , i told my colleagues close your eyes , say that you 're speaking to that 37 - year - old single mother of two who 's trying to make it to the 15th and the 30th of the month , " said @entity54			0
" what do we have to offer her ? how do we make her life easier , better , more manageable ? these are the kind of messaging things we need to do and i think we 've got ... real opportunities here , both to motivate women in the electorate , but also to motivate women to run for public office			0
" indeed , women make up a mere 8 % of the @entity2 @entity8 caucus			1
@entity8 @entity36 women comprise a staggering 29 % , by comparison			1
the @entity2 women agree it boils down to encouraging more @entity2 women to run			2
curiously , " women who are going to run for office , they almost need to be asked , " @entity39 said			0
" they need to make sure there 's a place for them			0
" male @entity2 members , who do n't traditionally seem to need such encouragement , are involved in recruiting women as well			1
in fact , @entity14 also involves educating elected @entity2 men " about connecting with women and doing a better job and going out and meeting with women			2
" rep. @entity96 ( @entity97 ) said			0
" women business owners , women volunteer organizations -- just doing a better job connecting with where they are , with things they care about , " @entity98 said			0
@entity106 , an @entity107 fighter pilot who flew combat patrols over @entity109 and @entity110 , is running in a rematch for @entity113 ' old seat in @entity114 , which she just barely lost to @entity116 @entity115 last year			1
she is exactly the kind of political recruit these @entity2 women say they 're looking for			2
" the @entity36 have been effective in attacking us and branding us in a way that 's just not accurate , " @entity106 said			1
" so in my race ... my opponent , a white man , was trying to lump me in the war on women , she said , pointing to a @entity36 attack line during the 2012 election accusing @entity2 of waging a " war against women			1
" " and here i am a pioneering military woman , the first to fly in command in combat			0
i sued @entity133 for making our servicewomen wear burkas over in @entity137			0
i mean , i am not a part of the ' war on women			0
' i 've been fighting for women my whole life , " she said			0
@entity106 said she does n't know why women make up only a small percentage of the @entity2 caucus			1
" i can only say that in my experience , running that when i engage with @entity2 , independent and @entity36 women in my community , and you talk about the issues that matter to them , " she said			1
" if we you connect with them , and we 're real , and we show our leadership , we show we 're solution oriented			0
" meanwhile , the top @entity8 @entity116 recruiter told @entity1 her party does n't need a special project to attract women candidates to run with our party			1
" @entity160 ( @entity161 ) , the chairman of the @entity162 charged with adding more @entity36 members , said @entity2 have a " wholly unappealing agenda " that alienates women and discourages them from affiliating themselves with the @entity2			1
she says republicans are " wrong " on the economic , healthcare , cultural , and education agendas " that are important to women			0
" " i think acronyms are nice , but at the end of the day women voters in this country and potential women candidates are going to continue to choose the @entity36 party because we value the input and feedback from women , and we 're the party that grows leaders , " she said			1
rep. @entity183 , @entity185 - @entity184 , who as head of the @entity187 is working to elect @entity36 to the @entity8 , told @entity1 " the difference between @entity2 and @entity36 is that they have to work hard to recruit women to run for @entity5			1
all i have to do is answer my phone			0
" @entity2 have their work cut out for them			0
@entity14 's website says the effort will focus specifically on recruiting , messaging , polling , candidate training , fundraising , a strong digital presence , and other things " to increase female participation			0
" at the end of the day , @entity39 believes that , despite appearances , women voters largely lean @entity2			2
" that 's why in @entity14 , we 're going to be focusing on listening , and recruiting , and engaging and motivating , " she said			0
" because we want women across this country to be involved in @entity2 beliefs			2
we believe most women are conservative			0
" @entity20 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
