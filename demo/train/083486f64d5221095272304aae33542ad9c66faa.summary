-- cat poop could be a " vast and underappreciated " public health problem , according to drs. @entity3 and @entity4			1
the pair on tuesday published a paper on the dangers of @entity9 oocysts , which are found in cat poop , in the journal trends in @entity12			1
in the journal article , @entity3 and @entity4 call for better control of the feral cat population and more research on the parasites			2
in the meantime , @entity0 asked the doctors how we can keep our families safe			0
@entity3 and @entity4 responded to the questions via e-mail			0
@entity0 : we 've heard that cat poop can be dangerous for pregnant women			1
should other people be wary , too ? drs. @entity3 and @entity4 : it is true that some cat poop contains @entity9 , a parasite for which cats and other felines are the definitive host			1
this parasite can affect the fetus if a woman becomes infected while pregnant			2
that is why pregnant women are warned against changing cat litter			0
it 's also well - known that @entity9 can cause major brain infections in individuals with @entity39 and other conditions associated with immune deficiency			2
chain of cat feces can harm humans , sea otters so what 's new ? recent studies suggest that individuals with disorders such as schizophrenia , obsessive - compulsive disorder , rheumatoid arthritis or brain tumors are more likely to have @entity9 antibodies than other people			1
there are also suggestions that @entity9 can affect memory and other cognitive function in people who are not otherwise ill. in no way have we established @entity9 as a cause of these disorders , but it has led us to rethink the possible risks of cat poop			1
@entity0 : how big of a risk are we talking about ? @entity3 and @entity67 : there are an estimated 82 million owned cats and another 25 million to 60 million feral cats in the @entity71 , and their numbers have increased markedly in recent years			0
based on studies done in @entity75 , it is estimated that these cats deposit 1.2 million tons of cat poop into the environment each year			1
at any given time , approximately 1 % of cats are infected with @entity9			2
the infective form of @entity9 deposited in cat poop are called oocysts ; a single infected cat can deposit millions of oocysts , each of which may survive in moist soil for 18 months or longer			1
it 's thought that it only takes one oocyst to infect a human , which is concerning			0
@entity0 : so what can people do to protect themselves ? @entity3 and @entity67 : it is important to note that cats that are always kept indoors are usually not a problem			0
almost all cats that become infected , and thus deposit infective oocysts , are outdoor cats			0
keep in mind cats are no respecters of property lines so a neighbor 's cat could deposit toxoplasma gondii oocysts in your garden or children 's play areas			1
weird science : kitty litter increases risk of suicide ? to stay safe , follow these suggestions : cat litter should be properly disposed of in the garbage , not flushed down the toilet where it can enter rivers and lakes			0
children 's sandboxes and play areas should be covered when not in use			1
cats selectively relieve themselves in areas with loose soil or sand			0
in the studies we reviewed , we found very high concentrations of @entity9 oocysts in these areas			1
if a sandbox has not been covered , the sand should be replaced and then kept covered			0
gardeners should wear gloves since gardens are another favorite place for cats to relieve themselves			2
one study reported that gardeners may have as many as 100 oocysts in dirt under their fingernails			0
vegetables from gardens should be thoroughly washed			0

some cat poop contains the parasite @entity9
new studies suggest it can affect memory , cognitive function in people who are not ill
doctors : *guard* kids ' sandboxes and play areas and wear gloves when gardening
