-- on wednesday , the @entity1 heard arguments in my case challenging the discriminatory @entity5 , widely known as @entity5			1
i was honored and humbled by the opportunity to have my case considered by our nation 's highest court			0
i have also been overwhelmed by the love and support i have received from people all across the country			0
to be honest , i never could have imagined that this day would come -- the day that i would be " out " as an 83 - year - old lesbian suing the federal government			1
my late wife , @entity18 , was , and is , the love of my life			1
although we could n't live openly for much of our relationship , we became engaged in 1967 with a circular diamond brooch that symbolized the rings we were n't able to wear on our fingers			0
and we stayed engaged for the next 40 years , caring for each other , sharing all the joys and sorrows that came our way			0
@entity30 years after longtime partner 's death we lived through good times -- with jobs that we loved , great friends and a lot of dancing			0
but we also depended on each other for strength through the vicissitudes of aging and illness			0
in 1977 , @entity43 was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis , which became debilitating over time			1
first , she had to use one cane , then two crutches , then a wheelchair			0
in @entity43 's last years , she was quadriplegic			1
we were lucky that the @entity47 never affected her brilliant mind or her cognition , and that she was able to continue seeing patients as a psychologist until the day that she died			0
in 2007 , we learned from @entity43 's doctors that she had only one year to live			1
when we realized that we were running out of time , we decided to marry in @entity55			1
that marriage was recognized in our home state of @entity58			0
we wanted to be married for the same reason most people want to marry : to publicly and legally express our love and commitment to one another			2
when our wedding announcement ran in the @entity65 , we heard from hundreds of people from every stage of our lives -- playmates and schoolmates , colleagues , friends and relatives -- pouring out love and congratulations because we were married			2
that 's why marriage is different -- it 's a magic word recognized by everyone as a demonstration of commitment and love			2
when my beautiful @entity43 died two years later , i was overcome with grief			2
over the next month , i was hospitalized with a heart attack , and , in the midst of my grief , i realized that the federal government would not recognize our marriage			1
@entity5 restricts federal marriage benefits and state - to - state recognition of marriages only to unions between a man and a woman			1
because of @entity5 , i was required to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes that i would not have had to pay had i been married to a man instead of @entity43			1
this was not only painful , it was wrong			2
i knew that @entity43 would want me to stand up for our marriage -- and for so many other gay couples and their families who are harmed by this unjust law			1
i believe that all marriages should be treated equally by the federal government in accordance with the @entity106			0
we won our case in two lower courts , and have now made it all the way to the @entity1 -- which is a monumental feat in itself			0
i know that @entity43 's spirit was with us wednesday at the oral argument			2
but our journey is not yet over			0
if , through my case , our story can help to ensure that the federal government treats all marriages equally , that will be the best possible final chapter in our love story			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity18 .			0

@entity18 : i never thought i would be an 83 - year - old " out " lesbian suing the government
she and @entity18 married in @entity55 , but @entity5 means @entity127 does n't recognize it
@entity18 : @entity5 is painful and wrong and @entity43 would want me to stand up for our marriage
she says marriage equality would be " best possible final chapter in our love story "
