@entity0 is helping young people who have to take care of an ill , disabled or aging family member			1
through her nonprofit , the @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity0 has provided assistance to more than 550 child caregivers in @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity11 asked @entity0 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity14 of 2012			1
@entity11 : what was your reaction when you found out that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity14 ? @entity0 : it was awesome			1
we 've really been hoping that would happen			2
this meaningful opportunity will help us reach even more children and families , and get more support for the kids			1
... it means the possibility of raising more awareness and being able to achieve our ultimate goal that no child should have to drop out of school because of caregiving responsibilities			2
@entity11 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to the @entity4 of @entity5 ? @entity0 : i hope it will help people understand that the kids are a part of the health care delivery system and that they should be recognized			1
we 're not advocating that children should do this or be in this position , but they are			1
so we want to make it as safe as possible and arm them with the knowledge base that they need			0
( this recognition ) will help us continue the path that we are taking , to provide continued and expanded services locally and to replicate our work in other parts of the @entity57			1
right now we have affiliates with signed agreements in four states , and we 're talking with others			0
the model is to partner with existing nonprofits who would like to reach this population of children and who 'd like to make a difference in the lives of these kids , who are in situations through no fault of their own			2
@entity11 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity14 ? @entity0 : it will be solely used by our organization to fulfill its mission			1
we provide professional support to the children in school , out of school and at home			1
we provide tutoring ( and ) respite to give kids and families a break			2
we 've provided computer support			0
we do a home visit to link families to resources			0
we provide sponsored activities and transportation to and from them			2
so all these things work together to strengthen the child , to give them more confidence and the skills that they need to go on to become healthy , productive adults			0
we have lots in the hopper			0
we have so much to do ; we 've only scratched the surface			0
@entity11 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity0 : it 's really a joy to see the lives of children and their families be transformed , and for them to know that someone out there cares about them			1
that it does n't take a whole lot to make a difference			0
and everyone can do it			0
the kids do n't have a voice , so they need somebody to be their voice , to be their advocate			0
... when these children receive the recognition they so deserve , along with the academic and skills support they need , they are able to remain in school and have confidence in themselves and what they are doing so they can become healthy , productive adults			2
plus , having the chance to participate in fun activities allows them to experience a bit of childhood otherwise lost			0
