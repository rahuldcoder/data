the @entity0 will hold a hearing on the increasingly political debate over the government 's handling of the @entity6 outbreak -- but not until after the midterm elections			1
@entity9 chairwoman @entity8 will hold an @entity6 hearing nov. 6 , two days after @entity11			1
that will mark the first hearing in the @entity14 - led @entity0 since the first three @entity16 cases of the deadly virus were diagnosed in @entity18 , according to a committee release out monday			1
the @entity21 - controlled @entity20 held a hearing last week to grill @entity23 officials over the @entity6 response			0
the @entity6 outbreak is quickly emerging as a top issue in the midterms , scrambling the political calculus in several races in the final stretch of campaigning			0
@entity32 from @entity34 - leaning states are under growing pressure to join @entity21 calls for a ban on travel between west africa , which is the epicenter of the @entity6 outbreak , and the @entity16			1
@entity41 sen. @entity40 is the latest @entity42 to back a travel ban , though she initially questioned the effectiveness of such a move and said it only made sense as one part of a broader strategy			1
sen. @entity50 of @entity51 and @entity53 @entity14 candidate @entity52 are also supporting a travel ban			0
those defections are ratcheting up pressure on other @entity32 -- both vulnerable incumbents and hopeful challengers -- to support a ban that top @entity16 and world health officials have said would not be effective and could harm prevention efforts			0
the @entity21 issued a statement friday attempting to goad @entity14 sen. @entity64 into supporting a travel ban after her opponent , rep. @entity62 expressed his support			0
it 's @entity40 's endorsement of the ban , though , that most clearly reflects the political pressure democrats are feeling as a result of the threat of @entity6 -- largely because it came just days after she 'd expressed reservations about a similar call from her @entity21 opponent , state house speaker @entity75			1
" that 's not going to solve this problem , " @entity40 said at a press conference early last week			0
" that 's not going to contain the epidemic that we see happening in @entity82			0
" but in a statement friday @entity40 said she had " said for weeks that travel restrictions should be " part of the plan to contain @entity6			2
" a temporary travel ban is a prudent step the president can take to protect the @entity16 people , and i believe he should do so immediately , " @entity40 said in the statement released friday afternoon			2
@entity40 , @entity50 and @entity52 are all facing tough challenges from the right and their campaigns are crucial to @entity32 ' chances of holding on to the @entity0 .			2

a @entity0 panel plans a nov. 6 hearing on the @entity6 threat .
democrats are increasingly calling for travel bans between @entity82 and the @entity16
*endangered* sen. @entity40 was the latest to do so , *reversing* her previous position .
