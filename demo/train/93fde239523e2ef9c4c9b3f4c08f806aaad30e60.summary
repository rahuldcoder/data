-- @entity1 and his partner , @entity2 , lost just about everything in their second - story @entity5 apartment , but they 're not dwelling on that -- they 're just glad to be alive			1
" i thought we were going to collapse and end up on the first floor , " @entity10 said , recounting the few minutes the two of them spent huddled in the corner of their bathroom			0
" i still think i 'm a little in shock			1
i 've had some tearful times			1
" it 's hard to even fathom how someone could return to work the day after a tornado like this , but particularly for someone with a job like @entity10 's : he works as a crisis counselor , helping people cope with disasters			1
" [ sometimes it 's ] a little difficult hearing other stories , " @entity10 admitted			2
" but it just feels normal to help other people , and it kind of helps me not focus on everything [ at home ]			0
" " but you just go through it , try to breathe and focus on what you can do for them , " he said			0
" you kind of have to compartmentalize things , you know ? this [ here at home ] is different than what i 'm having to do at work			1
" @entity10 works at @entity46 , the area 's largest behavioral health care provider , where @entity49 supervises crisis intervention services			2
she said now that the initial shock is starting to subside , more people are seeking professional help for their mental well - being			2
" it 's been the toughest four or five days of my entire career , " @entity55 said , adding that this wednesday , they saw four times the normal customer volume			1
" really , all anyone wants is a happy life , and right now , i do n't think there are very many in @entity5			1
" " most of them are searching for a loved one or have lost everything			2
" difficulty sleeping , an inability to focus or concentrate , and a lack of ( or increase ) in appetite are all signs that it may be time to meet with a counselor			0
" the effects emotionally on even the rescue workers and those still searching are just so overwhelming for everyone , even those of us trying to help them cope , " @entity55 said			0
case in point : @entity10 said that even he wanted the tables turned on him and asked colleagues for a debriefing session of his own			0
it kind of helps me refocus and get back in the game			0
" @entity90 's toll - free hotline is 800 - 247 - 0661			2
the center prefers that customers call before visiting , but walk - ins are welcome			0
the building where the counselors typically work was destroyed in the tornado , so @entity90 is operating its crisis prevention facility in @entity99 's third - floor patient education room			1
counseling services are free .			0

" i still think i 'm a little in shock . i 've had some tearful times , " he said
but he returned to work the day after the city 's *devastating* tornado
he says it can be tough to listen to others ' troubles , but doing so takes his mind off his own
