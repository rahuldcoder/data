-- @entity1 is admittedly a big guy , but more than a few super-fit cyclists in @entity3 have been left wondering how that dude just went flying by			1
@entity1 calls his electric bike a " hill eraser " because he can ride it to work without breaking a sweat			1
and then his wife , @entity8 , comes motoring past			2
" they stare , like how can a girl go past me , " she says , laughing			2
it takes the other riders a few seconds but then they figure it out			2
the @entity17 , who live in @entity18 , @entity3 , used to drive everywhere , except when they used their bikes for recreation			1
that changed when they got their new e-bikes , made by a company called @entity24			0
now , they ride to go shopping and to go to breakfast -- but mostly they ride to work			1
@entity1 says the couple has cut 50 percent of their car - use since they started electric biking			1
and there are other benefits			0
@entity1 dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure fell 10 points in the first six months he owned the bike , he says			0
the @entity17 do n't exactly classify themselves as " environmentalists , " although @entity8 said it is important to have a positive effect on the planet			0
" i learned that the worst amount of smog that you put out [ in an automobile ] is in the first mile , so if we can make even some of those shorter trips on our bicycles , it makes a big difference , " she says			0
who wants one ? @entity51 , director of sales for @entity52 , says electric bikes attract different types of buyers			1
many are looking to make a green imprint			0
some are " active adults " who have ridden bicycles for years who -- as they get older -- are unable to do the same kind of riding they did when they were young			1
other buyers want to ride their bikes to work quickly -- and avoid a sweaty entrance into the office			1
oddly -- or perhaps not -- @entity52 sees its strongest sales when the price of oil skyrockets , says @entity51			1
two wheels , a motor and 100 million riders electric bikes are still somewhat of a novelty in the @entity79 , but in @entity80 they 're everywhere			1
in fact , @entity80 electric bikes number more than 100 million -- which is about four times the number of @entity80 private cars , according to @entity85			1
the bikes are popular in @entity87 as well			2
sales figures for the @entity79 are hard to pinpoint			0
in the @entity79 , about 200,000 electric bicycles were sold last year , said @entity90 of the @entity91 -- about twice the number sold in 2005			1
but the industry has hit a bump in the road from the recession , as sales were down about 10 percent in 2009 , he said			0
e-bikes are mostly made by specialty companies , but the growing sales trend has been noticed by the big boys			0
@entity102 , a worldwide leader in bike sales , has been making electric bikes for three years , but only introduced them in the @entity79 in the past year			1
other well - known companies like @entity107 and @entity108 are increasing their presence in the e-bike field			1
at @entity112 , the biggest bicycle industry convention in the @entity79 , there were more than 20 companies displaying e-bikes this year			0
@entity51 said only a few years ago , it was about five			0
prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the @entity119 costs $ 398 at @entity120 -- to more than $ 13,000 for @entity122 's top - end model			1
prices increase as battery technology and components get better			0
@entity126 of @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity3 , said most buyers he sees do n't balk at the price , which can be as much as a good road or mountain bike			0
they are mostly concerned with how far they can go on a battery charge and how fast			0
what 's an ' e-bike ' ? by law , electric bikes must have no more than 1 horsepower and go no faster than 20 mph ( on motor power alone )			1
basically they are much like traditional bicycles with small motors that power the bike or assist a rider with pedaling			1
many have gears like a regular bike			0
" it 's just adding the throttle aspect , other than that it handles like a regular bicycle , " @entity1 said			2
he says he uses the throttle all the time , choosing one of two modes -- eco [ half power ] or fast [ full power ]			1
he says he once tried a regular bike for his 4 Â½ - mile ride to one of his music studios where he teaches jazz improvisation			2
but the hills nearly got him			0
he calls his electric bike a " hill eraser			2
" it also makes the ride to his farthest studio -- 22 miles away -- seem much closer			2
he says he gets about 35 miles on his primary battery and has an additional one for long rides			0
shifting views but as they tout the virtues of electric bikes , advocates also realize that there will have to be a shift in the way @entity79 view them before they become as popular as they are in @entity87 or @entity80			1
" there are two possible sides to the equation , " @entity126 said			0
" one would be a change in the way people view transportation			0
there are still a lot of suvs out there			0
... people still have a hard time thinking about riding a bicycle unless they are 10 years old , it seems			2
so there needs to be a little shift in mentality			0
" " but having said that , i think there is a growing awareness about health and transportation and environmental issues so it could be that we are just reaching a juncture where things will change [ for e-bikes ]			0
" @entity51 says people also have a preconceived notion about electric bikes			1
some view them as expensive or poor quality or uncomfortable			0
and @entity51 admits , e-bikes are not for everybody			0
as @entity126 says , people who live in @entity220 will probably always prefer a really good road bike and hard - core city cyclists may well stick to their fixed - gear bikes			1
@entity51 says @entity224 , which sells its bike for $ 2,700 , is n't for those kinds of people			0
" that 's not our customer , " he says			2
" our customer is someone who wants some form of electric transportation , green transportation , that can get them from @entity235 to point b comfortably			2
" the @entity17 say taking a test drive will change a skeptic 's attitude			2
" if you ride one , it will blow your mind , " @entity1 says			1
" when you get on one it 's like being in a flying dream you 've had			1
it 's like everything you 've dreamed your bicycle should do in your wildest dreams -- it 's doing it			1

electric bikes can run either on pedal - power or their tiny motors
" it 's like being in a flying dream ... it will blow your mind , " says rider
e-bike *commuters* like *saving* gas and arriving at work without breaking a sweat
@entity80 has more than 100 million electric bikes -- four times the number of cars
