@entity0 -- the @entity2 has again cast aside an appeal that raised doubts about president @entity7 's @entity6 citizenship , a grass - roots legal issue that has gained little legal or political footing , but continues to persist in the courts			1
the justices without comment monday rejected a challenge from @entity15 , a @entity16 man who sought a trial in federal court forcing the president to produce documents regarding his birth and citizenship			2
@entity15 's attorney , @entity22 , had argued in a petition with the @entity2 that @entity7 did not fit the definition of a " natural - born citizen " required for the nation 's highest office , as defined by @entity28 of the @entity29			1
that clause states , " no person except a natural born citizen , or a @entity34 , at the time of the @entity31 , shall be eligible to the office of president ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty - five years , and been fourteen years a @entity40 within the @entity6			1
" @entity15 , a retired military officer who describes himself on his website as a " genetic genealogy pioneer , " argues the framers of the 1789 document intended a " natural - born " citizen to mean someone born in the @entity6 to parents who were both @entity6 citizens			1
the high court and other courts had dismissed earlier , unrelated lawsuits from individuals questioning @entity7 's citizenship			1
state birth certificate records show he was born august 4 , 1961 , in @entity56 , @entity57			0
his mother is a native of @entity59 ; his father was born in @entity61 , which at the time was a @entity63 colony			2
" a person gains allegiance and loyalty and therefore attachment for a nation from either being born on the soil of the community defining that nation or from being born to parents who were also born on that same soil or who naturalized as though they were born on that soil , " said @entity22			0
" it is only by combining at birth in the child both means to inherit these two sources of citizenship that the child by nature and therefore also by law is born with only one allegiance and loyalty to and consequently attachment for only the @entity6			0
" he said it was " undisputed fact " @entity7 's father was a citizen of the @entity63 crown			1
the @entity7 administration did not file , and the high court did not demand , a formal government response to this latest legal claim			0
the high court will often insist the @entity96 weigh in with its views on a particular constitutional issue , or when it is being sued , and that is a sign the justices are seriously considering accepting the appeal			0
@entity7 and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate when he was running for president in 2008 , and have previously dismissed questions over his citizenship			0
other legal claims on the citizenship question whether @entity7 was in fact born in the @entity6 , and whether his birth documents are authentic			2
among the issues the high court has refused to fully address in these appeals involves " standing , " whether individual @entity6 can bring such a lawsuit , by first establishing personal , direct " harm " or " injury " from having @entity7 occupy the @entity117			2
overcoming that legal hurdle would allow such suits to proceed on the merits in courts			0
some of the claims of various " birther " movement organizers insist the president was born in @entity61 or @entity127 ; that his birth certificate is a forgery ; and that he had dual @entity6 - @entity63 citizenship at birth because of his father 's @entity61 heritage and therefore is not a " natural born " citizen			1
the case is @entity15 v. @entity7 ( 10 - 446 ) .			0

the @entity2 rejects latest appeal without comment
the challenge contends both a president 's parents must be @entity6 citizens
it says @entity7 's father was a @entity63 citizen
