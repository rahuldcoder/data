the scope and legality of the government 's warrantless electronic surveillance programs was discussed tuesday as a federal appeals court reviewed a lower @entity7 court 's injunction that would block collection of data from two plaintiffs who are suing activist @entity11 , an attorney who heads the group " @entity13 , " filed suit last year based on published reports of wrongdoing from whistleblower @entity17			1
the former contractor with the @entity19 accused authorities of misusing some of the capabilities he observed , and acting without a judicial or statutory basis			2
@entity11 , using himself as an aggrieved party from the surveillance , used the lawsuit to accuse the government of conducting " a secret and illegal government scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of domestic telephonic communications , " along with communications " from the internet and electronic service providers			1
" tuesday he said he has the standing to bring the suit as a customer of @entity37 , one of the companies known to be cooperating with warrantless surveillance			2
but when the appeals panel asked him for documented proof he had been targeted , @entity11 said only that the broad scope of the surveillance made it likely			0
the other plaintiff is @entity46 , whose son @entity47 was an @entity19 cryptologist and @entity48 in @entity49 in 2011 when he was killed in the downing of his helicopter by insurgents			1
the father told reporters he has been the target of secret intelligence gathering because he 's been asking questions about the circumstances surrounding his son 's death			0
both men late last year won a preliminary injunction that would have barred the government from collecting data on them , and it ordered authorities to destroy any data already gathered			1
but the @entity69 judge immediately stayed his order pending the appeal that was heard tuesday , because of " significant national security interests " that could be affected			0
@entity76 attorney @entity74 , defending the government , asked the appeals court judges to reverse the injunction , saying a phone company 's business records are not protected by the @entity81 against unreasonable searches			1
@entity83 said there was no documentation that any records gathered were " intrusively acquired			0
" he said @entity87 passes laws to protect privacy , such as for hospital records and banking , and that the government 's surveillance is constrained by the provisions of the @entity95 , with activities judged by the secret @entity97			1
@entity11 responded by pointing out the government 's admission of as many as 2,000 errors in how @entity19 conducted warrantless surveillance			2
" it 's false to say ' we do n't get into peoples ' underwear , ' " @entity11 said , asserting the indiscriminate collection alone is an intrusion he considers unconstitutional			0
after the hearing , @entity11 told reporters on the courthouse steps that he expects a ruling early next year , and that he expects the case to go the @entity113			2
he called warrantless surveillance by the government a case of monumental importance			1
" just the inception of acquiring that information -- they 're not entitled to it -- without any showing of probable cause , or reasonable suspicion of contact with terrorists , that 's the problem			0
and that 's a constitutional violation under our @entity81 and our @entity129			0
" @entity11 acknowledged in court he 's been a controversial figure over the years			0
a judge asked him if he feels he is being personally targeted			0
" i 'd be surprised if i 'm not , " he replied			0
among his recent lawsuits is one filed in october accusing the @entity136 administration of supporting terrorism because of what he considers " reckless and grossly negligent " handling of the @entity141 crisis			1
@entity11 , in that lawsuit , said the lack of travel restrictions from areas affected by the @entity141 crisis provides an opportunity for terrorists to use the disease for germ warfare .			1

@entity76 says *safeguards* *ensure* *compliance* with the law
case *descended* from *revelations* by whistleblower @entity17
one plaintiff has also sued the government for handling of the @entity141 crisis
