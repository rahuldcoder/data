" @entity0 , " and it 's the new face of comedy , too			1
since its debut in july 2013 , the original @entity4 series has become the poster child for the way many of us now watch tv -- in large doses , on our own time , and often on something other than an actual television set			0
but before " @entity0 " became the hottest topic for anyone with internet access , it was a languishing concept from " weeds " producer @entity17 , who was struggling to find a home for the series based on a book by @entity22			1
as viewers learned in season one , " @entity0 " follows a well - bred @entity28 named @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , who gets sent to a @entity32 women 's prison on an old drug charge that involved smuggling money for ex-girlfriend @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , who just happens to be serving time in the same facility			1
while there , @entity29 gets indoctrinated into prison life with a series of scenes that have become infamous , like a bloody tampon given to her in a sandwich and a cellmate urinating on the floor			2
@entity29 , along with characters like @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , a grim @entity49 cook ; @entity51 ( @entity50 ) , a transgender former firefighter ; crazy eyes ( @entity53 ) , who 's initially fixated on @entity29 ; and @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , a disturbed drug addict , bring this dark comedy to life in a way that would n't have been out of place on pay - cable networks like @entity63 or @entity64			1
except neither network wanted it			0
and then , in walked @entity4			0
with the company 's image changing from being a source of mail - ordered movies to a streaming hub of entertainment , the service happily snapped up @entity17 's dark comedy			1
as the writer / producer recalled to the @entity80 , @entity4 " pretty much bought it in the room			0
" the company 's eagerness has paid off in full , as " @entity0 " has become the service 's most - watched original series , according to an october letter to shareholders , and is already renewed for a third season			1
but first , we have to prepare for season two 's arrival on friday			1
though cast members and @entity17 are tight - lipped about what 's to come , here are a few tidbits on what to expect : 1			1
" i love graphic sex , the more sex the better , " @entity17 said at an industry lunch in april			0
and the show has certainly put some of its performers on display right from showering get - go			1
this year may include male nudity , @entity17 said , with a caveat : " i do n't think it 's going to be erect			2
you know that romantic triangle between prison guards @entity112 ( @entity113 ) and @entity114 ( @entity115 ) and @entity116 ( @entity111 ) ? it 's going to get messier			1
" there 's kind of a tectonic shift happening between @entity121 , @entity114 and @entity116 by the big point of the second season , and i think you might be surprised who you may be siding with in that triumvirate , " @entity113 told @entity118			2
@entity128 's had some success with his column about having a fianc√©e in prison , but his relationship with her is under strain			2
" if you 're going to keep @entity128 involved , there needs to be some sort of change , and there are some in store , " @entity136 , who plays @entity128 , told @entity118			0
more romance and back story			0
@entity145 ( @entity146 ) and @entity147 ( @entity148 ) are going to have a " sex contest , " reports tv guide			0
we 'll find out more about @entity47 's ( @entity48 ) @entity49 gangster past			2
and watch out for a key insect			0
a change of the guard ? a number of " @entity0 " stars have commitments to other shows			2
@entity148 ( @entity147 ) is doing an @entity161 show produced by @entity162 , and @entity113 is working on an @entity63 comedy			0
@entity36 ( @entity35 ) told the @entity164 she will be in just four episodes in season two , though she 's indicated she 'd be willing to come back full - time for season three			1
@entity17 is already thinking ahead			0
" if i could keep cycling people through and bringing in new people , the show could go on forever , " she told @entity118 .			0
