-- one of the busiest travel weeks of the year is upon us			0
with the uproar over the @entity5 's new airport security measures reaching a fever pitch , @entity0 has put together a short q&a to separate fact from myth and answer basic questions about what to expect if you 're flying this holiday season			0
q ) what exactly are the new @entity5 rules ? a ) when you arrive in the airport security checkpoint , you will be directed to either a traditional metal detector or one of the new advanced imaging technology ( @entity19 ) machines			1
passengers directed to the @entity19 machines can instead opt for an " enhanced " pat - down			1
@entity24 ) will the checkpoint look very different when i arrive ? a ) no. the only noticeable difference may be the presence of the @entity19 machines , which are larger than metal detectors			2
@entity24 ) does every airport have the @entity19 machines ? a ) no. there are approximately 400 @entity19 machines installed in 69 airports nationwide			2
the rest of the country 's roughly 450 commercial airports still only use metal detectors			0
@entity24 ) does everyone go through the @entity19 machines ? a ) @entity40 noted above , most airports in the @entity39 do n't have the @entity19 machines yet			2
and even if your airport has them , you may still be asked to go through a metal detector instead			1
@entity24 ) what sorts of images do the @entity19 machines show ? a ) they show a somewhat blurred outline of the passenger 's body			2
clear facial features are not shown			0
@entity24 ) is anyone exempt from the @entity19 machines ? a ) yes -- working pilots			2
q ) is advanced imaging technology dangerous ? a ) there are actually two types of advanced imaging technology -- backscatter x-ray technology and millimeter - wave technology			1
backscatter technology has raised concerns among some experts because it uses small doses of ionizing radiation			0
radiation experts say millimeter - wave technology poses no known health risks			2
the @entity5 says travelers are exposed to less radiation during an @entity19 scan than they would from two minutes of an airline flight			0
in other words , according to the @entity5 , it 's safe			0
q ) is the use of advanced imaging technology a violation of my rights ? a ) it depends who you ask			1
several lawsuits have been filed			0
one public interest research group is seeking a suspension of the body scanning program , arguing that the measures violate the @entity85 and the @entity86 , among other laws			0
courts , however , have traditionally given wide leeway for airport screening under the @entity85 , according to @entity91 , a @entity92 law professor who specializes in @entity39 constitutional law			0
q ) does everyone get the new enhanced pat - down ? a ) no. fewer than 3 percent of the flying public are subjected to the enhanced pat - down , according to the @entity5			1
pat - downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the @entity19 machine or the metal detectors , and those who opt out of the @entity19 machine			1
a few randomly selected passengers will be subjected to a pat down even if they clear the metal detector or ait machine			1
q ) what 's included in the enhanced pat - down ? a ) the @entity5 does n't provide an exact description of the new pat - down procedure			1
passengers subjected to the screening , however , have indicated that @entity5 representatives have probed their entire body , including the posterior , crotch , and chest			0
@entity24 ) why is the enhanced pat - down necessary ? a ) " it just makes good security sense , " the @entity5 says on its website			1
" the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we 've found during pat - downs speak to this			2
" q ) am i going to be subjected to a pat - down in front of fellow passengers ? a ) you can request to have the pat - down conducted in a private room with a passenger witness of your choosing			1
q ) i have a metal implant in my body			0
am i more likely to require a pat - down ? a ) no. in fact , if you go through an ait machine , you may be less likely to require a pat - down			1
a metal detector will be set off by the presence of metal inside the body -- potentially leading to a pat - down			1
the @entity19 scans the exterior of the body , and should therefore not detect the presence of metal inside the body			2
q ) are kids exempt from enhanced pat - downs ? a ) children under the age of 12 requiring additional screening will receive " a modified pat down , " according to the @entity5			1
q ) what happens if i refuse to go through a complete screening ? a ) passengers who refuse complete screening wo n't be allowed past security and could face civil penalties , according to a @entity5 statement			0
q ) will all airports have the new @entity19 scanning machines in the future ? a ) that 's the goal			0
@entity0 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report			0

the new rules require passengers to go through a regular metal detector or a new @entity19 machine
if you set off the detector or machine -- or refuse to go through them -- you will get an " enhanced " pat - down
the new advanced imaging technology machine is *generally* considered safe
only 3 percent of the flying public will likely need an enhanced pat - down
