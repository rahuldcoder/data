@entity0 -- hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded @entity0 's streets sunday , shortly after the city 's new chief executive was sworn in during a ceremony with @entity8 president @entity7 on the 15th anniversary of @entity0 's return to @entity8 sovereignty			1
despite the humid weather , organizers reported that 400,000 protesters turned out for the annual july 1 protest against what they say is the ever - encroaching hand of the @entity8 central government in the city 's affairs and freedoms			1
it was the largest turnout since the estimated 500,000 protesters who marked the same date in 2003			0
police put the figure at a much lower 63,000 people			0
the march capped a weekend of opposition to the appointment of chief executive @entity31 â € ” also known as @entity31 -- who was voted in by an electoral college of 1,200 influential figures in @entity0 with @entity35 's approval , as well as the suspicious death of @entity38 dissident @entity37			1
these recent flashpoints topped the list of ongoing grievances about the lack of universal suffrage , soaring housing prices , worsening pollution and a growing wealth gap			0
amid megaphone - led chants for @entity31 to " step down " and myriad banners and costumes mocking @entity31 as a cunning " wolf , " some protesters waved the former @entity0 flag used under @entity54 rule -- a gesture used to symbolize the erosion of the city 's freedoms following the 1997 handover			1
other protesters used images of the @entity63 cartoon to mock @entity31 's claim that @entity63 stickers in his home showed that previous tenants were responsible for his home 's illegal â € ” and highly controversial -- building structures , which came to light last week			0
draping a @entity63 sash across his chest , @entity0 artist @entity71 steered an all - pink army tank labeled as the " cultural bureau , " mocking @entity31 's proposed new government department			1
see photos of the july 1 march significantly , @entity31 's swearing - in ceremony on sunday was fully conducted in @entity79 rather than the local @entity81 language , a move that did not go unnoticed by citizens sensitive about the encroachment of @entity8 's national language in @entity0			1
if we have to watch a leader we did n't elect get sworn in , we could at least have it conducted in our own language , " tweeted user @ supercharz , @entity87			0
@entity31 ignored reporters ' requests for comment about the protests as he exited the ceremony			0
the carefully orchestrated ceremony was interrupted during @entity7 's remarks by a heckler who shouted slogans calling for a redressing of the @entity103 massacre and the establishment of a democratic @entity8 nation before he was bundled out by security			0
the ceremony capped @entity7 's three - day visit to @entity0			2
@entity7 left the city before the july 1 march commenced at 3 p.m. local time			1
however , hundreds of protesters gathered outside @entity7 's hotel on saturday , where they were enclosed within unusually high barricades that towered more than 2 meters high , which had not been used in @entity0 since @entity118 protests in 2005			2
several protesters and journalists were pepper - sprayed in the scuffle			0
during @entity7 's tour at the @entity128 cruise terminal the same day , an @entity123 reporter who yelled out a question about the @entity103 massacre was removed by police from the press area and questioned under a stairwell			0
meanwhile , the @entity0 protests went unmentioned in the extensive coverage of the handover anniversary presented by @entity8 state - run television station @entity137 and news agency @entity135			1
@entity1 's television broadcasts about the handover anniversary in @entity0 were blacked out in mainland @entity8 on sunday and monday , while @entity142 's coverage was also censored after it veered from @entity31 's inauguration remarks to mentioning concurrent protests			2
a photo circulating widely online sunday picturing fireworks exploding in @entity147 over the heads of protesters captured the divide between the government 's representation of the sentiment surrounding the handover anniversary and the discontent brewing amid many citizens			2
in a statement addressing the july 1 march , the @entity0 government said it " fully respected people 's rights to take part in processions and their freedom of expression and would listen to their views in a humble manner			1
" it went on to say that the government will " uphold the core values of @entity0 and protect the freedom and rights of the people			0
