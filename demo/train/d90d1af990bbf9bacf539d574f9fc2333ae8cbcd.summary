@entity3 @entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 believes that rapes resulting in pregnancy are " something that @entity7 intends to happen			1
" do you ? it 's a relevant question as we enter the last two weeks of this election , because @entity0 's comments are not isolated			2
the statement comes from the same rigid ideology behind conservative @entity1 candidate @entity16 's musings in august , when he said women 's bodies have the ability to " shut down " pregnancies that result from what he called " legitimate rape			1
" @entity0 and @entity16 were both trying to explain their determination to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest , a position consistent with the @entity2 platform , which calls for a constitutional ban on abortion			1
@entity35 and some other leading republicans repudiated @entity16 's comment			1
but as i pointed out in a @entity41 column at the time , the problem seemed to lie with the politics and optics rather than underlying policy			0
republicans are desperately trying to close the gender gap with women , and one way to do it is to insist that this election is only about economic issues			2
but many conservative candidates for @entity1 harbor deep - seated social conservative views , an absolute opposition to abortion among them			2
it 's a position that vice-presidential nominee @entity56 has long held			0
most @entity57 believe that abortion should be " safe , legal and rare			0
" and a stunning @entity59 taken earlier this month in 12 swing states found that 39 % of women who are registered voters said that abortion was the most important issue for women in this election			0
with the @entity67 likely one vote away from overturning @entity68 -- a goal that @entity35 has reaffirmed on the campaign trail -- this issue is real and relevant			0
that 's why @entity0 's centrist @entity73 @entity1 opponent @entity72 said , " the @entity7 i believe in and the @entity7 i know most @entity74 believe in does not intend for rape to happen â€” ever			1
... what mr. @entity0 said is shocking , and it is stunning that he would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape			2
" the case against electing a right - wing ideologue like @entity0 to the @entity1 goes deeper than social issues			1
when @entity0 took on the senior @entity1 statesman @entity83 in a @entity2 primary with @entity86 support , he specifically attacked @entity83 's record of bipartisan problem - solving , saying : " the time for collegiality is past ... it 's time for confrontation			1
" that 's the kind of change a tea - vaneglist candidate like @entity0 represents for the @entity96 , the @entity2 and the nation -- more hyper - partisan fighting , more absolutism and more religion influencing public policy			1
there 's nothing libertarian about government forcing a woman to carry her rapist 's baby to term			0
let 's be clear -- @entity0 's attempt to square his religious beliefs with his public policy beliefs is what led to the tortured statement			1
but what @entity0 said was not a mistake or a misstatement			0
it 's what he truly believes			0
combined with his commitment to be an obstructionist and absolutist in the @entity1 , instead of a bipartisan problem - solver , it presents a clear choice with national implications because he 's the only @entity1 candidate running for whom @entity35 took the time to cut a tv ad			0
@entity3 voters will get to decide if @entity0 's comments are consistent with their common sense approach to politics and problem - solving			2
voters across the nation will need to decide whether they want to empower his extreme vision of politics in @entity136 over the next four years .			0

@entity2 's @entity0 says " @entity7 intends " any pregnancies that come from rape
@entity141 : this is like @entity16 's assertion that women do *n't* get pregnant from rape
@entity0 urges confrontation , wants to *justify* extremist positions on social issues
@entity141 : electing @entity0 means hyper - partisan fighting , absolutism , religion in policy
