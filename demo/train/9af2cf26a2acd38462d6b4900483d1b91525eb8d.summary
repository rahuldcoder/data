-- it took more than 3Â½ decades , but @entity3 @entity2 has finally recovered the remains of her father , and in doing so , her identity			1
the @entity9 mother of three , who lives in @entity10 , this week received confirmation that a body found in a @entity14 cemetery is that of her father , @entity15 , who disappeared in 1976 when she was just a few days old			1
it 's a story about the depths of repression reached during @entity9 's so - called @entity19 from 1976 to 1983			1
thousands of people , mainly leftists , trade unionists , students , marxists and their sympathizers , were targeted by the military regime that took power in march 1976 and even before then			2
some were executed ; many others simply were never heard from again			0
@entity3 @entity2 had been seeking the truth about her father since she learned in the year 2000 , when she was 24 years old , that the military couple who raised her were not her biological parents			1
" i was appropriated , " @entity15 says , using the term given to children whose parents were killed or disappeared during the @entity19 and were given to other couples			1
the organization known as @entity41 ( may @entity42 ) , helped her find the truth about her identity			0
the organization helps people , who were taken away from their politically persecuted parents as children , reconnect with their past			0
@entity51 , a spokesman with @entity52 , says that for @entity2 , learning the truth was n't easy			1
" it took a long time for her to accept it ; but when she did , she was then ready for the next step , which was finding out how her parents died , " @entity51 said			2
the @entity60 ( @entity61 by its @entity63 acronym ) announced this week that forensic and dna tests prove that human remains found in a @entity14 cemetery are those of @entity2 , known as " @entity68 , " who went missing in february 1976 when he was 20 years old			1
@entity70 , president of @entity61 , said that identifying the remains of @entity2 was a process that started 10 years ago in @entity73 , @entity14 , across the @entity74 from @entity10			1
" in 2002 we exhumed eight unidentified bodies from the cemetery in @entity73			2
at that time , we had no hypothesis as to how the bodies ended up there , " said @entity70			2
@entity61 took dna and forensic samples from the bodies			0
in 2007 , the independent organization started taking blood and @entity81 samples from people in @entity9 with missing relatives			0
@entity3 @entity2 was one of 8,500 people who left samples over the following four years			1
finally , a match was made this year			0
but how did the body of a man kidnapped in @entity10 end up in a different country ? @entity70 believes @entity15 was killed during the so - called " death flights , " a series of military flights in which political prisoners were thrown alive into the sea			1
@entity15 's body probably washed ashore on the @entity14 coast			1
a nameless tombstone was placed over his grave in @entity73			0
for @entity107 , seeking the truth about her origins has been a slow and painful process , but she says knowing what truly happened has given her some closure			0
" recovering my true identity was paramount , " @entity15 said			2
" having a true identity is a human right			0
recovering the remains of my father has been important not only to understand how he died , but also to bring some justice to @entity9 and the victims of the regime			0
" @entity15 says her rendezvous with her past is only halfway done			2
her adoptive parents , whom she calls " my appropriators , " told her both of her biological parents had died in a @entity10 shootout in february 1976			0
she has no knowledge or clues about what happened to her mother			2
her adoptive parents are deceased			0
she called it " a miracle " that the @entity135 organization found her and , " with a drop of my blood , was able to identify the remains of my father , buried in @entity14 since 1976			1
" now with a son who , at 20 , is as old as her father was when he disappeared , @entity15 said she hopes the episode shines a little more light on a dark past			1
" as painful as it may be , we need to find the truth about our history , " she said			0
" by exhuming and identifying our loved ones after all these years , we give them back their dignity			0
