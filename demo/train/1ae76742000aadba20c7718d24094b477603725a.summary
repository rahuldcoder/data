a strong @entity1 military is indispensable to our national security			0
as retired military officers , we have dedicated our careers , on active duty and retired , to that end			0
we have been involved in crafting and teaching national security strategy , of which military strategy and use of military force are vital components			2
in the debate over the @entity19 budget and with threats of deeper cuts coming , the president , @entity14 , governors and the entire defense community are rightly concerned about sequestration , which cuts both domestic and defense spending indiscriminately			1
it is agreed that overall spending reductions are necessary , but the " fiscal cliff " crisis reflects a lack of political will , not rational planning			2
too often , the @entity19 spending debate is ensnared in the outmoded ideology of past wars and driven by legions of lobbyists for parochial interests in the military - industrial complex			1
@entity1 's power is more than a massive force structure and numbers of ships , tanks and planes			2
a national security strategy must be based on current and future threats , not past war doctrines			1
in 2008 , a @entity47 declared the economic crisis , not terrorism , as the greatest threat to national security			0
former chairman of the @entity55 adm. @entity54 , along with other senior military leaders , endorsed that assessment			0
@entity57 : will we get big fiscal deal , or small ? it is doubtful that future threats will call for many of the expensive weapon systems advocated by parochial interests and some political leaders -- a system such as the f - 35 joint strike fighter			1
developing this plane has cost more than was spent on veterans in the last 20 years			1
today , the use of manned aircraft is more and more limited			0
our leaders must have a serious debate about priorities : @entity1 needs political resolve to kill unnecessary and expensive projects			1
our nuclear weapons policy is based on @entity79 conditions that no longer exist			1
the @entity19 is expected to spend more than $ 700 billion on nuclear weapons over the next 10 years , for little added security			1
the former @entity1 strategic command chief gen. @entity82 has called for a drastic cut in nuclear weapons , saying the @entity1 has a stockpile " beyond our needs			0
what is it we 're really trying to deter ? our current arsenal does not address the threats of the 21st century			0
" the program is based more on ideology than security			2
sadly , defense spending is driven by political interests , not necessity			2
in his 1986 book " @entity102 , " @entity97 argues that great powers fall by bankrupting themselves to rule extensive empires			0
after the invasion of @entity104 , @entity97 published an op - ed , " @entity108 , " suggesting @entity1 may furnish material for another chapter			0
in the last decade , @entity1 fought two expensive wars and @entity14 has yet to pay for them ; that policy has contributed to our precarious economic position			0
sequestration is not an effective means of excising wasteful @entity19 spending ; it is the result of political gridlock and special interest intransigence			1
as @entity14 attempts to undo its own mess and prevent sequestration , the @entity19 budget needs to be on the table			2
reducing wasteful spending on unneeded programs and outdated strategy will save money and enhance national security			1
the political argument that cutting defense spending will cost jobs is spurious			0
@entity19 spending purchases one item and does not provide greater economic benefits			1
the f - 35 program is slated to cost $ 1.5 trillion over its lifetime ; these are resources that are desperately needed elsewhere or could pay down the national debt			1
after more than a decade of wars of dubious value , @entity1 will receive a greater return on investment by investing in our troops and veterans returning from @entity104 and @entity146			0
every dollar wasted on unnecessary programs could be caring for and training our servicemen and women			0
instead of building new toys that are kept in the garage , let 's provide education and job training to veterans			1
recent congressional refusal to approve such a jobs program is a disgrace			0
cutting @entity19 spending recognizes that national security is more than military power			1
the @entity1 is stronger with a strong economy , sustainable jobs , investment in education , renewal of our infrastructure and a sensible energy strategy			0
continuing to waste money when our nation should have other priorities is bad policy and bad for security .			2

***writers*** : @entity19 spending is based on strategies from old ideology and driven by lobbyists
generals : strategy must be based on today 's and future threats , not @entity79 doctrines
***writers*** : unnecessary f - 35 strike fighter costs more than money spent on vets in 20 years
***writers*** : instead of building expensive new toys to keep in the garage , let 's *rethink* priorities
