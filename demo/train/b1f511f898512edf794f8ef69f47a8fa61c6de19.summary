the moment he stepped aboard the @entity3 airliner , @entity0 felt like he 'd entered a @entity6 time machine			1
for an aviation enthusiast like @entity0 , it was nothing short of thrilling			1
after years of anticipation , @entity0 , a real estate investor , finally snagged a seat on a rare 1980s @entity16 - built @entity15 airliner			1
patriotic military music filled the cabin			2
flight attendants handed out communist propaganda magazines			0
as @entity0 put it , that 2012 flight on @entity23 airlines from @entity24 to @entity25 was an experience " beyond belief			1
" that 's high praise			2
@entity0 may rank among the most accomplished " avgeeks " in the world			0
he said he 's flown on at least 50 kinds of aircraft and racked up an estimated 2 million air miles			2
" the @entity15 - 62 , by @entity37 standards , was quite old , but it was actually one of the newer planes i flew on while i was there , " @entity0 said			1
only a handful still fly in commercial service worldwide , he said			2
its interior decor might have been inspired by a waiting room inside a 1970s @entity16 doctor 's office , @entity0 joked			1
upholstery : saggy and blue			0
@entity50 : a kind of speckled linoleum			0
but also spectacular and well - kept			2
the 28 - year - old @entity55 native who lives in @entity56 , @entity57 , has @entity59 - like avgeek skills , which he 'll show you -- if you prompt him			2
" when i get on a plane , i can not only tell you where it was manufactured , i can also tell you when it was produced , " @entity0 said			0
his expertise has earned him appearances as an aviation analyst on @entity55 's @entity67 , the @entity68 and the @entity69			1
@entity0 also shares his avgeek adventures as a correspondent for @entity72			0
how to travel to @entity3 a police state that 's largely cut off from the world may run its national airline a bit ... differently from the @entity77			1
crew members appeared to be " thoroughly inspected before they get on the plane , " @entity0 said			0
neither a hair nor a button out of place			0
@entity0 was surprised when the flight attendants began speaking to him in @entity85			0
" you got the feeling that -- in @entity3 society -- aviation ranks among the most prestigious career paths , " he said			1
" it allows them the extremely rare experience to explore their own country and to experience a bit of the world outside their borders			0
" flight attendant says ' nut rage ' ex-airline exec cursed and shoved after barreling down the @entity24 runway , the powerful @entity15 rocketed into the sky like a fighter jet , @entity0 said			0
when it leveled off , it was time for meal service -- @entity3 style			1
entree : cold chicken , warm potato curry , cold ham and a bun dessert : fruit salad " it was n't terrible , " @entity0 said			0
at other times during @entity0 's @entity3 tour , in - flight meals may have been served with a side of paranoia			1
he and other passengers said they saw " metallic glints a couple hundred feet above or below " their plane			0
they suspected these " glints " were reflections from unseen military aircraft shadowing them nearby			0
" you ca n't really be too scared , " @entity0 said			0
" but you realize that if the pilot ever went crazy enough to make a run for the @entity134 with you on board , the aircraft would n't be airborne for very long			0
that 's only mildly disconcerting			2
" fear is relative , he reminds himself			0
" i mean , remember , you 're on a 30 - year - old @entity141 aircraft in @entity3 , " @entity0 joked			1
" you kind of get weirdness fatigue after a certain point			0
" opinions about @entity23 have been mixed			1
a 2014 review by @entity147 - based @entity146 gave it only one star out of five , for poor service			2
but flying enthusiast @entity150 , who said he 's traveled on @entity23 a dozen times , disagrees			1
" they provide decent service , " @entity150 said			0
" they 're just using some different equipment , which , as a flight enthusiast , you totally enjoy			0
" just like its airplanes , @entity3 's airline roots are planted in @entity161			1
in 1950 , authorities formed an airline called @entity164 , which linked @entity25 and @entity165 , according to flight global			2
in 1955 , @entity3 's national carrier @entity23 formed , according to @entity23 's website			1
the government renamed it @entity23 in 1992			1
efforts to modernize @entity23 's fleet have been stymied by longstanding international economic sanctions against @entity3			1
among jet - setting avgeeks , @entity150 reigns as the " arch - duke of aviation photography , " @entity0 said			1
@entity150 said he has flown 111 types of aircraft and logged more than 2.4 million miles			0
he fell in love with aviation while growing up in @entity179 , watching spectacular takeoffs and landings at the now - defunct airport known as @entity183			1
years later , @entity150 had turned into a full - fledged avgeek , flying on the world 's rarest aircraft and scoring seats on new types of planes			1
to pay the bills , @entity150 , 34 , works as a financial markets investor from his home base in the @entity194			0
he figures the money he 's spent over the years would have bought him " a couple more houses			2
" @entity150 's bragging list includes : farewell commercial flights on a @entity201 and a @entity200 one of the last flights of the supersonic concorde first test flight of the world 's biggest airliner , the @entity207 inaugural flight of the sleek new @entity209 bragging rights create " a healthy element of friendly rivalry " among his fellow avgeeks , @entity150 admits			2
" but aviation is big enough for everyone to enjoy			2
" enthusiasts gather at conventions like a @entity220 - area event co-sponsored by @entity72 called @entity221 , which has quickly gained popularity since it launched in 2009			1
a self - described " @entity224 " for enthusiasts is @entity226 , hosted this june in @entity223			1
these are the places where avgeeks will be writing their bucket lists of planes they most want to fly on			1
for @entity0 , there seems to be no shortage of determination			0
his holy grail is a four - engined @entity141 bomber nicknamed " @entity237 , " many of which are still in service at @entity141 and @entity241 military bases			2
" there has to be some sort of quasi-legal way to get on one , " @entity0 said			0
" so i 'm gon na keep working at it			0
