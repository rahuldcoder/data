-- while there has been much discussion about the heartburn the new @entity5 rule on carbon emissions is causing @entity7 in this year 's midterms -- especially those from energy producing states -- the person who should be most troubled about the president 's decision is @entity14			1
the administration 's new coal rule could singlehandedly give the @entity18 nominee in 2016 a path to victory in an @entity21 that has been getting more and more difficult for the @entity18			1
states that have trended @entity7 can flip back red			1
@entity24 , the @entity18 has certainly missed your 18 @entity21 votes			1
@entity27 ( 20 votes ) and @entity29 ( 16 votes ) had all but turned blue , but with higher utility bills coming to voters before 2016 , both are right back in play for the @entity18			1
win two of those three states and the @entity18 wins the @entity37			1
@entity39 's 13 electoral votes just got a lot more winnable , too			2
there is a reason the president did not act so aggressively on his environmental agenda until after his re-election			2
it would have doomed his campaign			2
his political advisers responsible for his re-election would have never allowed it			2
the political folks are gone now and the president does not have to think about things in a political context anymore ; he gets to think about himself and the history books			2
but what 's a legacy issue for @entity57 may not be a good thing for @entity14			0
to achieve the president 's goal of a 30 % emissions reduction will cost money , a lot of money			0
much of the money will come from working families paying higher utility bills in an already difficult economy			0
jobs will also be lost as businesses grapple with higher energy costs			0
the @entity5 itself estimates electricity costs will increase up to 7 % by 2020 , critics say it will be far higher			0
the critics will be right on this one			0
in 2014 , the debate for @entity78 candidates will be about the prospect of higher utility bills			0
in 2016 , the debate will be about actual higher utility bills			1
it will be interesting to see the first presidential poll in @entity83 after utility bills spike			1
if i 'm a @entity87 adviser , it is already giving me nightmares			0
when voter 's utility bills go up , they get mad			0
just ask the @entity92 in @entity93			0
they got decimated last year for passing a carbon tax			1
just five days before @entity97 in 2010 , @entity92 prime minister @entity96 vowed at the @entity98 , " there will be no carbon tax under the government i lead			1
" that promise was not kept and a carbon tax went into effect in 2012			1
as a result of the carbon tax , @entity93 utility bills went up over $ 500 per household a year			1
public opinion turned on a dime			0
@entity96 was removed from the 2013 ballot by her own party before a sure defeat and was replaced by former prime minister @entity112			0
now , on behalf of his legacy and place in history , president @entity57 and his @entity5 are going to make things difficult for the left in @entity120 in 2014 and beyond			0
and all @entity14 can do about the @entity5 rule that is creating an electoral minefield for her 2016 bid is applaud			2
@entity87 can not be critical of the @entity5 rule or she could risk alienating her base and losing a second nomination fight			0
the environmentalists are a powerful force in @entity7 primary politics , especially on the money side			0
the 2016 presidential campaign just got a lot more interesting			2
@entity29 and @entity27 , welcome back to presidential politics , you are now again swing states			1
the path to 270 electoral votes for the @entity18 nominee just got a lot easier			1
and president @entity57 may have just denied @entity14 the @entity37 , for a second time			1
join us on @entity142 / @entity141 .			0

@entity144 thinks the new carbon emission *standards* could work against *democrats*
the rules could push swing states over to the @entity18 in the 2016 election , he says
@entity144 : states like @entity83 , @entity27 and @entity29 could switch from blue to red
win two of those three states and the @entity18 wins the @entity37
