@entity0 , a @entity1 veteran , wanted help			1
and he knew where to get it -- through the @entity5 -- or so he thought			2
again and again , starting in december 2012 , @entity0 would try to schedule with -- and would even show up to see -- doctors at @entity8 medical facilities in @entity9 about his shortness of breath , according to his daughter			1
he thought he had gotten confirmed appointments ; even toting cards with a specific date and time			2
" he 'd have the card in hand , go to check in , and they 'd tell him , ' mr. @entity0 , you do n't have an appointment in the computer			1
we have no idea what you 're talking about , " his daughter @entity22 told @entity23			0
in october 2013 , @entity0 showed up at his daughter 's house after going in for another appointment that never happened			1
his daughter set out then to make sure @entity0 had a firm time in the @entity5 computers , not just written down on a card			1
the next available slot he could get , after all that effort , was in three months , on january 6 , 2014 , according to his daughter			2
on @entity36 2013 , he struggled for breath and was rushed to a private hospital			0
@entity0 was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure ; " he was only breathing at 50 % , " according to his daughter			1
the next day , he was in intensive care			0
and six days later -- on january 7 , a day after he was to finally see a doctor at the @entity5 -- he was dead			1
@entity22 remembers her dad as a man who " made it out of a gruesome , gruesome , gruesome war , " who dutifully worked in construction , who raised three children on his own and who never put himself first			0
more than anything , she remembers him as her " best friend			0
" she believes that the system that was supposed to care for him -- a man who 'd risked his life for his country -- instead let him down			0
" they took a man and broke him down and kicked him when he was down , when he needed them , " @entity22 said			2
" ... these people who were supposed to take care of him are able to live freely			0
" the @entity0 family is not the first to levy accusations against the federal agency charged with overseeing health care and benefits of veterans and their dependents			2
@entity23 first reported six months ago about allegations of alarming shortcomings within the @entity5 medical care system that , according to the @entity5 , led to 23 deaths			1
the @entity5 's troubled history the allegations include the possible destruction of a secret waiting list for care at the @entity79			1
there have also been claims of delayed care and cooked books at @entity5 facilities nationwide			0
the @entity5 did not respond to a @entity23 request for a response to the @entity0 family 's specific allegation			1
and because of privacy laws , it is hard to know if @entity0 was on anyone 's list at the @entity5 , secret or not			1
@entity79 officials deny there 's a secret wait list the @entity5 's @entity96 is now investigating these various allegations at 26 @entity5 facilities , and there have been hearings on @entity101			1
@entity22 has been among those speaking up ; @entity23 first learned of her family 's story after she appeared at a forum in @entity106 featuring sen. @entity107 in the wake of the scandal			0
much of the focus has been on the @entity5 's management back in @entity112 , including calls for secretary @entity114 to be fired			2
yet @entity22 says no one looking into this matter can fully comprehend the frustration and the torment experienced by families like hers , who just want their loved ones looked after in a fair , responsible , humane way			0
" i do n't think anybody clearly understands what 's going on , " she says , " unless you actually lived it and you 're going through it			0
" @entity5 investigating @entity130 hospital wait lists			0

@entity0 repeatedly tried , failed to get appointments with @entity5 , his daughter says
he ended up being hospitalized before seeing a @entity5 doctor ; he died in january
the @entity5 has n't responded to this specific claim , but is looking into general allegations
@entity0 's daughter : the @entity5 " kicked him when he was down , when he needed them "
