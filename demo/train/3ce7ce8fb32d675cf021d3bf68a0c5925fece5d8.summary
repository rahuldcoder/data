-- life has its share of both stormy and sunny moments			0
there are clouds ( your car broke down ) and then there are silver linings ( but at least it 's a nice day for a walk )			0
while most of us would classify the recession as the mother of all clouds it , too , has a silver lining			0
the current recession has sparked a big upswing in entrepreneurial pursuits , and small businesses are cropping up around the country			2
according to a recent study by the @entity30 , " rather than making history for its deep recession and record unemployment , 2009 might instead be remembered as the year business startups reached their highest level in 14 years -- even exceeding the number of startups during the peak 1999 - 2000 technology boom			1
" although the highest spike in startup rates was among people ages 35 - 44 , the entrepreneurial bug has n't only bitten those established in their careers			1
many young people are also turning toward owning their own businesses as an alternative to finding a full - time , entry - level job			1
" young people are keenly aware of the recent economic downturn , and have seen parents , relatives or friends lose their jobs , " says @entity44 , executive director of the @entity46 chapter of @entity47			2
" they understand they can not count on the same job -- or even the same career -- for an extended period in the future			1
for growing numbers , this means ' making their own job ' as entrepreneurs			0
" below , how three young people are doing just that : @entity64 , editor - in - chief , @entity66 @entity64 started @entity67 as a sophomore at the @entity69 , when she noticed a lack of fashion publications directed at college students			1
although it only took her only a few hours to create her blog , " it kind of took off from there , " she says			0
currently , @entity66 gets around 1.5 million page views per month			0
" by the beginning of my senior year , i was already earning more money from the site than i would have at an entry - level management job , " @entity77 says			1
" the idea of giving that up to search for a 9 - to - 5 job did n't seem very attractive			1
in addition , i have always really enjoyed working on the site -- i thought , ' so long as i 'm still having fun and can afford to work for myself , why not stick with it ? i can always get a job later if it does n't work out			1
' the poor state of the job market only made me feel more confident in my decision			0
" after working for herself since graduating college in 2009 , @entity77 doubts she could ever begin working for someone else			0
" i know i work 10 times harder for myself than i ever would for someone else , so i 'll be more successful long - term as a self - employed person			0
the self - employed lifestyle really suits me ; it 's a great fit for my personality and i am very happy with my choice , " she says			0
@entity101 , founder , @entity103 " one night while watching tv , i saw an infomercial that caught my attention and i thought it would be a good idea if i could test out products before i had to buy them			2
with a little tweaking of that idea , the @entity114 concept was born , " says @entity101 , who will be a senior at @entity111 in @entity112 this fall			2
@entity103 is @entity101 's daily contest website , where he promotes companies by giving away their products to his audience			1
" i started this business in january 2009 at the age of 19 as a hobby just to review products and give them away , but since january 2010 , i have been selling days on a calendar to companies and so far have sold close to 200 of 365 days this year , " says @entity101			1
companies he 's worked with include @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity135 clothing			0
@entity101 has no plans to trade @entity103 for a full - time job after graduation next year			1
@entity139 , ceo , @entity140 in the year and a half since @entity139 started @entity140 , the company has sold more than $ 4 million in real estate and rented over 100 apartments			0
@entity139 started his business while still a student at @entity147 , but says it never crossed his mind to do anything but grow his business when he graduated this past may			2
" as the ceo of my own company , i learn diverse skills and take on responsibilities that i would never be able to get in a traditional entry - level job , " he says			1
although @entity139 says the economy played little role in his decision to pursue his business ( " i was already determined to continue growing the @entity161 business rather than pursue a job search , " he says ) he certainly understands the plight of his peers that were forced to enter the job market			2
" this has certainly been a hard year for the graduating class of my undergraduate business school			0
many students had a difficult time finding jobs , and many people are still looking			1
i was lucky enough to have a successful business that allows me to support myself financially , and i try to do whatever possible to help my friends as they continue their job searches , whether in helping them to network with business associates of mine or making them a part of the @entity140 team , " he says			2
to those who might be having a hard time finding a job after graduation , @entity139 says : " young people should keep in mind that starting your own business is always an option -- if you feel comfortable with your abilities and have an idea that you can realistically build on after graduation			1
