in september , the @entity20 released a report by noted @entity23 jurist @entity22			0
the report concluded that both sides committed war crimes during the conflict , which killed about 1,400 palestinians and 13 @entity4			1
but @entity30 chief @entity29 said last week that the world body has not made a determination on whether both sides have done enough to investigate allegations they committed war crimes during the three - week conflict , which began at the end of december 2008			1
in a report , @entity29 outlines steps @entity4 and @entity28 have taken to fulfill a @entity30 demand for credible and transparent inquiries into civilian casualties			2

" @entity4 handed @entity29 a response outlining the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of the offensive in @entity6 , which was aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into @entity4			1
the @entity4 military has " launched investigations into 150 separate incidents , including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far , " according to the report			2
for its part , the @entity60 said it had created a commission to look into various charges of abuses , but made clear that it did not view the potential wrongdoing on the @entity60 side as seriously as that allegedly committed by the @entity4 military			0
" there is absolutely no symmetry or proportionality between the occupying power and the occupied people " wrote @entity68 , @entity60 ambassador to the @entity20			0
