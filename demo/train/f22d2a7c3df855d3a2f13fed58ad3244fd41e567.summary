@entity0 , @entity1 -- there are n't many people who would voluntarily be pepper - sprayed , but at @entity0 in @entity1 young @entity5 are doing just that			1
it 's part of their training to protect @entity10 embassies around the world			1
after they get a face full of pepper spray , the @entity5 must immediately complete a course that includes various defensive obstacles			1
" we need to have an understanding of what it does , " 21 - year - old cpl. @entity16 explained to @entity2 about 20 minutes after having been sprayed directly in her eyes			2
" if we were to spray someone and we are contaminated with it as well , we need to know how to contain ourselves , " she said			0

the @entity35 , which president @entity36 signed in january , approves the addition of 1,000 @entity5 to the current force of 1,200			1
plans to increase the size of the force were under way at the time of the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity10 diplomatic compound in @entity46 , @entity47 , resulting in the death of ambassador @entity49 and three other @entity10			2

the @entity77 will consist of approximately 100 guards that can be dispatched on a moment 's notice			0
they will be on a " quick tether , " according to @entity67			0
" so instead of requesting through the normal military channels ... they would come directly to us , and we would be able to provide this security augmentation unit to help reinforce that particular embassy or consulate , " he said			1

instead , local guards provided from the host country are designated to protect the e ( s )			0

although most of these enlisted trainees are young -- typically 20 or 21 years old -- security guard is not an entry - level position			1

" no sir , still alive , sir , " the young @entity5 responded			2
