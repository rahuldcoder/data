-- a first - class return ticket from @entity2 to @entity3 for $ 43 and four air miles sounds too good to be true			2
and when @entity6 purchased such a fare -- which usually costs about $ 11,000 -- using @entity9 's online ticketing system last week , he knew that 's exactly what it was			1
but he also knew from first - hand experience that " error fares " -- rock - bottom fares mistakenly issued by carriers -- can sometimes be recognized as good for travel by airlines			1
having booked two fares at rock - bottom prices on the site , @entity6 , who runs an advice website for frequent flyers called @entity25 , alerted his readers to the " amazing deal " on his website , encouraging them to take advantage of the offer before @entity9 corrected the glitch -- then waited to see if the ticket would be honored			1
" everyone knew this was a mistake -- a huge one			0
one of the biggest i 've seen an airline make , " he said			0
airlines regularly make errors resulting in mispriced fares being issued , sometimes honoring them but often not			1
" i 've been on a lot of crazy mistake fares in the past that did work out , the airlines did honor them , " said @entity6 , who recounts how he recently flew round trips from @entity2 to @entity44 and @entity45 on three consecutive weekends for $ 138 a trip			1
see also : ' @entity54 ' airline charges just dirty tricks ? @entity6 said he was optimistic that although the fares were clearly issued in error , @entity9 would be required to honor the tickets following a recent ruling on " mistake fares " by the @entity62 @entity61			1
the rule means that a purchase occurs once the customer pays the full amount -- and that once the purchase is confirmed , whether through an email or credit card transaction or other means , " then the seller of air transportation can not increase the price of that air transportation to that consumer , even when the fare is a ' mistake			2
' " @entity6 had received a confirmation email from the airline , suggesting the fare should be valid under the new rules			2
but @entity9 contacted him and others to tell them that the incorrect fares had been issued due to a " programming error			1
" customers who wished to retain the fares would be charged the full amount , or could cancel the purchase and have any fees waived			2
@entity9 spokesman @entity89 said it would have been clear that the fare was a mistake as the correct amount was displayed on the same screen			2
on website @entity95 , @entity9 said the fact that the correct price was displayed was a " unique circumstance " unlike " other widely reported ' mistake fares			1
' " however , for customers who had already begun their travel by the time the glitch was detected , the airline would honor their return fares			1
the airline would not say how many people booked flights for the incorrect price , or how many actually managed to travel on the cheap fares by commencing their travel before @entity9 took action			1
@entity6 said although he " would have liked the airline to have honored " the fare , he was n't going to lose any sleep over missing out			0
but he said it would have provided a good test case for the @entity61			0

" if we find a carrier violates our rules , we can issue fines and cease - and - desist orders , " he said			2
airline responses to pricing mistakes are unpredictable			0
in 2010 , @entity133 refused to honor first - class return tickets from the @entity62 to @entity135 , worth up to $ 20,000 , it had sold for the coach price of $ 1,100			0
but it offered $ 200 vouchers as compensation			0
the previous year @entity140 also failed to accept $ 40 flights to @entity142 , offering $ 300 vouchers instead			0
but in 2008 @entity144 honored some $ 0 flights booked between @entity146 and destinations in @entity148 and @entity142 , while refusing others			0
@entity6 polled his site users and asked them if they thought taking advantage of such mistakes was unethical			0
while about a quarter thought those who booked the tickets were " bottom feeders trying to ruin a poor airline , " he said , the majority was comfortable with opportunistically capitalizing on the mistakes of airlines			0
what do you think ? would you knowingly book an " error fare " with an airline ? @entity163 is doing so unethical ? let us know in the comments section below .			0
