it 's starting to feel like @entity1 for women in corporate @entity3			1
another year , another story of zero growth for women when it comes to holding corporate board seats and executive office positions , according to a new report by @entity12 , a nonprofit focused on women and business			1
for the eighth year in a row , the group found no significant change in the number of female members of corporate boards , with women holding 16.9 % of board seats in 2013 versus 16.6 % last year			1
and while there was big news earlier this week when @entity24 was named @entity26 's new chief executive officer -- the first woman to head a major @entity3 automaker -- there has been no uptick in the total number of female executive leaders for the fourth year in a row , according to @entity12			1
last year , women had 14.3 % of executive officer positions , and this year the percentage is nearly the same , 14.6 %			1
" i would look at the numbers and say , for those companies who are not making the advancement of women to leadership a priority , they should really be embarrassed , " said @entity37 , @entity12 's chief operating officer , who will take over as president and chief executive officer in january			1
" there is absolutely no excuse in 2013 to continue to have women underrepresented to this degree in the leadership of @entity54 companies			2
" consider @entity55 , where women were n't just underrepresented on the company 's board -- they did n't exist			1
that is , until earlier this month when the company , after criticism of its all - male board , named its first female board member : @entity65 , the former chief executive officer of a @entity68 - based education and media conglomerate			1
why no change for women at the top ? the big question is : why so little movement for women ? why -- at a time when women make up half the labor force , when there has been plenty of research on how a diverse board and leadership team of men and women improves a company 's bottom line and when women have been thinking more about " leaning in " through marriage and motherhood -- are we finding absolutely no change for women at the top ? @entity93 is chairman and chief executive officer of @entity95 , one of the 20 % of companies where women hold one - quarter or more of executive officer positions			1
in fact , at @entity95 , four out of 10 executive officers are women and 25 % of the board 's seats are held by women			1
in his view , the issue is n't about equity or fairness , but attracting the best talent , which benefits a company 's bottom line			2
" @entity114 tells a very simple analogy , " said @entity93 , a @entity12 board member , during a phone interview			1
" if you and i were going to pick an all - star team and we had a room with a hundred people in it and you got to pick your share of the team from the whole hundred people and i only got to pick from 50 people on the right side of the room , who would have a better team ? you would , " he said			0
" for some reason , i think lots of management teams are n't seeing it that way			0
they 're picking the best athlete for a role , but they are not really insisting on a diverse slate and looking broadly to make sure they 've got talent from all the best pools that are available to them , " said @entity93 , a 30 - year company veteran			2
what stands in the way of women @entity149 @entity148 is executive director of @entity150 , a national advocacy organization focused on getting 30 % of board seats in the @entity3 to be held by women by the end of 2015			1
one big stumbling block for women , she said , is the length of term limits on boards , which , on average , are about 10 years			0
" if you are not renewing your board , regardless of who your candidates are , except for every 10 to 20 years , then you are obviously not going to bring any new candidates in			2
" @entity148 also said the composition of many boards is a problem : " if you take a board ( where ) the leadership is only considering sitting or former ceos of their industry , which i think most corporate governance experts would agree ... is not a healthy approach ... obviously , you are not going to get women because it goes all the way down the food chain			1
" part of the challenge , too , is convincing male leaders there 's not a limited supply of strong female candidates			1
men and women see different reasons for why there are n't more women on corporate boards , according to a survey of more than 1,000 board members from around the world in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 by @entity196 professor @entity195 and researcher @entity197			1
" when it came to trying to understand ... why we are not making as much progress having more women on boards , you had male board directors who basically said , ' you know what , there 's not enough supply , ' " said @entity195 , who created a class at @entity196 focusing on ways to get more women on corporate boards			1
" then you have another side -- you have female boards of directors who are basically saying it has nothing to do with supply			2
what 's happening is that it 's impossible to get on boards			0
so you have two very different explanations , " he said			0
@entity93 , the ceo , shared a story from an executive many years ago who wanted to hire a female sales rep on his team			1
" his group that was doing the hiring came back and said , ' you know what , we 've looked and looked and we just ca n't find good female sales reps			2
can we just hire from our usual sources ? ' " " he said , ' well , i 'll tell you what : i want to first interview all the females that you 've rejected			0
' so guess what ? they went out and found some female sales reps			0
" what works to add female leaders while the story for women in corporate @entity3 has n't changed much over the last several years , there 's a completely different narrative for women in many other countries			1
" the bottom line is countries around the world are paying attention , " said @entity250			0
" the key is , they 're saying this is a priority and we need to act now			0
" in @entity259 , the country launched a " @entity260 , " which , among other measures , includes having companies publicly disclose their gender diversity targets			0
since then , women 's share of executive officer positions jumped from 8.3 % in 2009 to 16.6 % in 2013 , @entity37 said			2
in @entity279 , after a call for companies to voluntarily increase targets for the number of women in leadership , women 's representation in the @entity269 or the " footsie " -- the 100 companies listed on the @entity272 -- jumped to almost 19 % from 12.5 % in 2011 , according to @entity12			1
some @entity281 countries , like @entity282 , have gone further , mandating controversial quotas , requiring a certain number of seats of every company 's board be filled by women			1
@entity148 of @entity150 likes much of what other countries are doing , but said she believes quotas would n't be effective in the @entity3			0
" quotas basically force companies to bring in candidates just to achieve ( a ) goal , and i 'm not sure that 's necessarily the most healthy way to put a board together , " she said			2
the key , @entity148 said , is getting the commitment and engagement of corporate leaders themselves			0
" if corporate leaders engage and work together and try to determine tactically how we do this , i think that we will be successful , " she said			0
putting diversity on the agenda @entity93 , who has been leading @entity95 for 10 years , said he probably did n't put enough emphasis on the issue of advancement for women early in his tenure as ceo			2
" i had women on my team			0
i was supporting the diversity , but it was n't enough on my leadership agenda			0
i was n't pushing hard enough on it so my board pushed me to say , ' hey , you 've been going sideways for a couple of years on this			0
what are you going to do to get it on your agenda ? ' " @entity195 's new class at @entity196 focuses on what women can do to build their careers , what organizations can do to create more inclusive cultures and what governments can do to help			2
for many reasons , he sees a personal stake in the future			0
" i have four children , two are girls and they 're pretty young , " he said			0
" i am going to do everything in my power to make sure that i helped to build companies in 10 years that will be much , much more receptive to my daughters than the companies that i know exist in 2013			0
" follow @entity346 on @entity55 and like @entity347 on @entity348 .			0
