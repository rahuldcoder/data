-- a new study on healthy women with genetic mutations that sharply increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer supports the old adage : an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure			1
the report , published online monday in the @entity13 , studied nearly 5,800 women with specific genetic mutations called @entity16 and @entity17			1
researchers found that women with @entity16 and @entity17 mutations who protectively had their ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian , fallopian tube , or peritoneal cancer by 80 % , and their overall risk of death by 77 %			1
@entity17 stands for breast cancer susceptibility genes , a class of genes known as tumor suppressors			1
mutations of the @entity16 and @entity17 genes have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer			1
according to monday 's study , women with @entity16 mutations should have preventive ovarian surgery -- known as prophylactic oophorectomy -- by age 35 , as waiting appears to increase the risk of ovarian cancer			2
in contrast , women with @entity17 mutations can safely delay surgery until their 40s , the study suggests , as their risk of ovarian cancer is not as strong			1
the new research provides doctors with additional information to support the risk - reducing surgery , said ovarian cancer expert dr. @entity56			0
removing the ovaries in these patients " provides more benefits than just the reduction in ovarian cancer because this study shows there 's a survival benefit that has not been shown this clearly before , " she said			0
7 questions on cancer gene testing @entity70 is an assistant professor in the @entity71 and @entity72 at the @entity73 in @entity74			0
she was not involved in the study			0
according to the @entity78 , previous studies have shown that removing the ovaries of a premenopausal woman with @entity17 mutations can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 % to 95 % , and the risk of breast cancer is cut by 50 % to 60 %			1
but monday 's study is the first study to show an overall mortality reduction benefit			0
" to me , waiting to have oophorectomy until after 35 is too much of a chance to take , " said @entity88 , professor of medicine at the @entity91 in @entity92 , and the study 's lead author			0
" these data are so striking that we believe prophylactic oophorectomy by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with @entity16 mutations			0
" @entity17 mutations grabbed national headlines last year when actress @entity104 announced she carries a mutation of the @entity16 gene and had underwent a preventive double mastectomy at age 37 to reduce her risk of breast caner			1
@entity104 's mother , actress and producer @entity112 , died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56			2
" my doctors estimated that i had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer , although the risk is different in the case of each woman , " @entity104 wrote in a @entity116 op - ed article in may			1
" once i knew that this was my reality , i decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much i could , " she said			0
" i started with the breasts , as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer , and the surgery is more complex			1
" dr. @entity133 , an associate professor of @entity134 at @entity135 of @entity136 , said another important aspect of the study is how it breaks down the differences researchers saw between @entity16 and @entity17 2 carriers			2
" in most of the guidelines , we do n't distinguish between the two , but this study separated the two groups for potential age for prophylactic oophorectomy , " said @entity133 , who was not involved in the research			0
he said the study tells women with the @entity17 mutation they can probably wait until they are 50 to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed			2
" these results could make a real difference for women with @entity17 mutations , who face tough decisions about whether and when to undergo a prophylactic oophorectomy , " @entity153 , a member of the cancer communications committee at the @entity155 , said in a statement			2
" importantly , for women who will be undergoing this surgery early in life , it 's reassuring to see that it carries long - lasting benefits , substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk , " he added			0
why more women are choosing double mastectomies @entity0 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
