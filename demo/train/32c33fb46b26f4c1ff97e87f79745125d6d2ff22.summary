@entity0 appears to have gained more ground in @entity3			1
@entity5 fighters surrounded one of @entity3 's largest air bases tuesday , a police captain in @entity10 province and other security sources told @entity1			1
the militants are preparing to launch an attack on @entity15 military airbase , which is halfway between @entity16 and @entity17 , said @entity10 police capt. @entity18			0
@entity10 has been largely overrun by @entity0 , which has been waging war for months in order to establish a caliphate -- or a society run by strict @entity25 law			2
it has also taken over large swaths of @entity28 , near the border with @entity30			1
coalition forces have been trying to battle back , but @entity0 is getting into position in @entity3 with rocket launchers and tanks in villages to the south and east of @entity15 , @entity31 said			1
president @entity38 said he is focused on the fighting taking place in @entity10 and vowed airstrikes will continue there and elsewhere			1
" this is going to be a long - term campaign , there are no quick fixes involved , " he said tuesday at @entity42 , during a meeting of military leaders from 22 countries who are part of the coalition fighting @entity0			1
" we 're still in the early stages , " the president said			0
" as with any military efforts there will be days of progress and there will be periods of setback , but our coalition is united behind this long - term effort			0
" nearly 60 countries are now part of the effort to stop @entity0			2
opinion : why we must talk to bad guys -- even @entity0 two deadly car bombs exploded in @entity68 on monday and one on tuesday			0
the militants claimed they were behind the blasts			0
one targeted the police checkpoint in the @entity75 neighborhood of @entity76			0
four people were killed and 12 others were injured when a car bomb being driven by a someone on a suicide mission exploded in an area called @entity83			0
the target was a security checkpoint at one of the entrances to the predominately @entity75 neighborhood , police officials told @entity1			0
@entity0 released a statement on its media site claiming that the @entity93 attack killed a member of the @entity3 @entity95 , @entity96 , who was a member of the @entity98 , a main @entity75 bloc in the government			1
on the surface , @entity100 remained calm tuesday , despite @entity0 advances from the west			0
@entity105 , who sells fish at a market , noted that @entity0 has taken control of even more territory since the coalition airstrikes began			1
nearby , @entity111 , who sells fruit and has two sons in the @entity3 army , said the airstrikes are " like theater			2
" the @entity3 army 's track record in fighting @entity0 is not good			1
it has lost control of @entity121 , @entity3 's second largest city , and is now struggling to keep control over @entity10			1
@entity38 on @entity0 : expect ' long - term campaign ' @entity0 advances in @entity28 in @entity28 , @entity0 fighters bombed and blasted their way through the strategic city of @entity127			1
columns of smoke rose as the sound of gunfire erupted			0
coalition airpower -- aided by @entity133 -- has been focused intensely on @entity28			2
@entity134 said tuesday that it had bombarded @entity0 near @entity127 , using bomber and fighter aircraft to fire 21 airstrikes that destroyed two @entity0 staging locations , a building , a truck and two vehicles and damaged other @entity0 property			1
another @entity144 strike near the @entity28 city of @entity146 struck a modular oil refinery and initial indications are that this strike was successful			0
the strikes are meant to prevent the extremist @entity152 group from resupplying and massing combat power on the @entity155 - held portions of @entity127 , @entity134 said in a release			0
all coalition aircraft used in missions against @entity0 departed the space safely , the military said , and analysis of the strikes suggests that they slowed @entity0 ' advance			2
but @entity134 warned that " the security situation on the ground there remains fluid " with @entity0 attempting to gain territory and beat back the @entity155 military , which is putting up a fierce fight			2
opinion : why we must talk to the bad guys -- even @entity0 @entity30 in or out ? the fight for @entity127 brings @entity0 right to the border with @entity30 , but @entity30 's contributions to the fight against @entity0 remain unclear			1
after @entity144 national security adviser @entity177 said sunday that @entity30 had agreed to allow the @entity144 and its partners to use an air base and territory for training , @entity30 officials said monday that they had not decided whether to allow use of the @entity184 airbase			2
on tuesday , secretary of state @entity185 said that @entity30 is still committed			1
" i mean , @entity30 has agreed to host and train and equip people			0
it certainly has allowed the use of certain facilities , and we do n't need to get into the specifics except to say that i do n't believe there is any discrepancy with respect to what they will or wo n't do			0
" " @entity127 is caught in between the @entity144 and @entity30			1
it 's a pawn right now , " retired col. @entity196 , the former special adviser to @entity198 gen. @entity197 , told @entity1 's @entity200			0
@entity30 is still focused on removing @entity28 president @entity201 and has been fighting it 's own battle with @entity155 separatists inside @entity30 , @entity196 said			1
@entity30 even launched strikes against @entity155 positions within @entity30 in recent days , according to its military			0
@entity127 is an example of the fissures that exist within the coalition about the overall strategic goal , @entity196 said			2
