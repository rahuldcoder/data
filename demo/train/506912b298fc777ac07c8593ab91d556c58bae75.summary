a little more than two years ago , @entity0 felt his left leg weakening , and he found himself quickly running out of breath			1
doctors first thought he had asthma , but in may 2010 they told him he probably had @entity5 , or @entity7 's disease			2
in august 2010 , doctors confirmed @entity0 , then 38 , had the fatal disease , and he knew it was progressing			2
" every month they [ doctors ] could see deterioration , " @entity0 said			2
@entity5 patients lose muscle function in the lungs until they can no longer breathe			1
most people with @entity5 die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms , according to the @entity18			1
the disease causes nerves to wither and the lungs to stop working			2
about 10 % of @entity5 patients live 10 years or longer			1
@entity0 joined a clinical trial at @entity23 in @entity24 , where doctors were injecting neural stem cells -- the precursors to nerve cells -- into the lower spinal cord of @entity5 patients			1
before the procedure , @entity0 walked with a cane and would get winded just by walking to the mailbox			2
he had to quit his job as a manager for a shredding company			2
he was so tired he could n't play with his three children			0
he was too weak to pick up his youngest child			0
he could n't even open a @entity39 bag			0
@entity0 hoped the treatment would help , but he did n't expect it to			0
however , two weeks after getting the stem cell injections in march , he says he started to feel better			1
" it 's been nothing short of miraculous , " he says			0
" i can not begin to explain the difference it has made			0
" he has n't touched his cane in months , he says , and his breathing has improved			0
" i was afraid i would wake up and the improvements would be gone , " @entity0 said			0
dr. @entity50 , who is overseeing the clinical trial at @entity23 , and dr. @entity52 , who invented the surgical procedure used to inject the stem cells , explained to patients that participation in the trial would not cure or even benefit them personally , but it would help doctors learn more about how to treat als in the future			1
the first phase of any clinical trial is to prove that a treatment wo n't injure patients , not that the treatment works , said dr. @entity65 , who designed the clinical trial at @entity23			1
the first part of the @entity5 study , sponsored by the @entity69 - based biotech company @entity68 , is designed to show that the surgical procedure to inject the stem cells into the spine is safe , and that the patients ' bodies wo n't reject them			1
according to researchers , the cells did not harm any of the 12 patients in the @entity23 study , nor did they accelerate the progression of their als			1
" i need to temper my excitement because it 's a very small patient population , " said @entity65 , president of the @entity79			0
but the facts are not discouraging			0
she presented early data from the study monday at the neurological group 's annual meeting in @entity87			0
" we have cautious optimism that a few of the patients may have slowed in their progression of lower extremity weakness , and one patient may have improved , " her report said			1
of the 12 patients in the trial , two have died			1
@entity99 's disease had progressed further than @entity0 's by the time he received the stem cell injections in 2010			1
he was already in a wheelchair , and he knew participating in the clinical trial would n't cure him			1
but he told @entity103 in april 2010 that the only way doctors were going to figure out how to cure @entity5 was to have people willing to participate in clinical trials			1
" for me it just seemed like the right thing to do , " he said			0
@entity99 died of @entity5 in may			0
another patient in the study , a 39 - year old man , died of a heart attack			0
@entity65 said the conditions of eight of the remaining 10 patients have not changed			1
based on these results , she and her team in @entity116 are asking the @entity118 to allow them to move to the next part of the trial : injecting stem cells higher on the spine - into the cervical spinal cord , which is in the neck			1
@entity0 is optimistic that research like this will give other patients hope and lead to treatments in the future			2
he realizes he has n't been cured , but it 's like his clock has been set back , he says			0
he feels like he did when symptoms first started to appear in 2009			2
" i know i still have @entity5			0
i am so grateful for this gift regardless of how long or short it lasts , " he said			0
" i can go through most days without thinking i have @entity5			0

most people with als die from respiratory failure within three to five years of first symptoms
patients in @entity23 clinical trial have neural stem cells injected into spinal cord
first part of trial is designed to show injecting neural stem cells into the spine is safe
