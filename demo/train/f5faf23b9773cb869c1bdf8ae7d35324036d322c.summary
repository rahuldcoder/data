the world champions again lost their way in the middle overs , losing eight for 27 at one stage as they wilted against @entity1 's spin			2

@entity4 's reply always looked on track with @entity32 hitting 48 at the top of the order before @entity35 anchored the innings with an unbeaten 30 from 68 balls			2

@entity62 gave them hope with a thumping 48 before holing out , and @entity65 posted 50 , but with precious little support from their team - mates their efforts proved in vain .			0
