-- federal judges tentatively ruled on monday that @entity2 must reduce the number of inmates in its overcrowded prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners ' rights			1
@entity2 must cut the number of inmates in its prison system by up to 40 percent , judges have ruled			1
" overcrowding is the primary cause of the unconstitutional conditions that have been found to exist in the @entity2 prisons , " the court concluded			1
@entity2 state officials , including gov. @entity18 , immediately promised to appeal the case to the @entity21 @entity20 , if necessary			1
" the governor and i strongly disagree with this ruling , " said @entity22 , @entity2 's corrections and rehabilitation secretary			0
implementing the court 's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released , @entity27 said , describing it as a threat to public safety			2
he disputed the court 's contention that the prisons are unsafe the way they are now			0
but in 2006 , @entity18 declared a state of emergency because of " severe overcrowding " in @entity2 's prisons , saying it had caused " substantial risk to the health and safety of the men and women who work inside these prisons and the inmates housed in them			1
" in court documents , the judges said the state 's prison system was at about 200 percent of capacity			2
the ruling is the result of two class - action lawsuits on behalf of @entity2 prisoners who said medical and mental health care in the state 's prisons are so inadequate that they violate the federal constitution 's @entity63 ban against cruel and unusual punishment			0
the judges said their ruling is tentative so that the parties involved can plan accordingly , essentially giving them an opportunity to work things out themselves before an official ruling is rendered			2
the court suggests a two - to three - year window for reducing the number of prisoners in the system			0
those who would be released would be very low risk , according to @entity79 , director of the @entity80 , a group that provides free legal services to @entity2 prisoners			1
he said the ruling would affect those in jail for three or four months because of parole violations , those getting early release dates , and those who might qualify for early release for taking part in rehabilitation programs			0
a final ruling also probably would reduce the number of people entering the prison system , with many being diverted through the courts and into rehabilitation programs instead of going to jail , @entity79 said .			0

overcrowding has created unconstitutional conditions , judges conclude
gov. @entity18 immediately promised to appeal the case
