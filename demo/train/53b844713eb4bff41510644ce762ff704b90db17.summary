so many hours of talks , so little progress			0
despite two days of intensive negotiations , @entity5 and six world powers " remain far apart " on @entity8 's controversial nuclear program , @entity3 foreign policy chief @entity2 said saturday in @entity9			1
her words dashed hopes that the deadlock might be broken after what had seemed more promising talks back in february , also in the @entity9 city of @entity16			0
@entity5 's top nuclear negotiator , @entity18 , acknowledged there was " some distance " between @entity5 and the six powers but seemed more positive in his assessment			1
" good negotiations " had taken place in this round of talks , @entity18 said , which he described as " substantive , expansive and comprehensive			1
" but in a sign that progress was limited , no date or location has been set for new talks			1
this round was just the latest in a decade - long attempt to resolve differences between @entity5 and the international community over @entity8 's nuclear ambitions			1
the first day of talks proved inconclusive			0
by the end of saturday , despite " long and intensive discussions , " the two sides were no closer on agreeing on confidence - building measures , @entity38 told reporters			0
" it became clear that the positions of ( the world powers ) and @entity5 remain far apart on the substance , " she said			1
" we therefore agreed all sides will go back to their capitals to evaluate where we stand on the process			2
" @entity38 said she would be in touch with @entity18 " very soon in order to see how to go forward			2
" while @entity38 said these were the most detailed discussions that the two sides had had , with " a real back - and - forward between us , " she also made clear that she was disappointed by the lack of progress made			2
a senior @entity63 administration official said @entity18 directly engaged him in a 30 - to 40 - minute question - and - answer exchange in the middle of saturday 's plenary meeting			1
" the quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth , this q and a , " the official said			0
" we just went back and forth with him			0
" still , the official expressed disappointment , saying that @entity5 had " put forward some minimal ideas and expected great return , and quite disproportionate return			2
" @entity80 , too , took a hard line after the talks			2
" the @entity80 went to @entity9 ready with our partners to negotiate in good faith with @entity5 , " @entity80 foreign secretary @entity83 said in a statement			1
" @entity5 's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough			1
" when negotiators from the diplomatic bloc of six nations -- the @entity63 , @entity94 , @entity80 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 -- last sat down with @entity5 's envoy in @entity16 in february , they delivered what they characterized as a " fair and balanced offer " to defuse tensions over the @entity5 nuclear program			1
instead of delivering the " concrete response " @entity105 governments had expected , @entity5 announced it was making its own proposal to the negotiating parties			2
' two - way street ' @entity18 said @entity5 had tabled a proposal based on the discussions in @entity16 and a previous meeting in @entity112 -- and that it is now down to the six world powers to respond and show their " willingness to take appropriate confidence - building steps in the future			1
" he repeated @entity8 's position that @entity5 has the right to a peaceful nuclear program			1
" creating confidence is a two - way street , " he said			0
now , after many proposals put forward by @entity5 , it 's the turn of the six world powers to respond , he said			1
@entity18 's comments on @entity5 's enrichment of uranium -- one of the most contentious issues at stake -- reaffirmed @entity8 's right to pursue that track but also appeared to leave the door open to some kind of negotiation			1
" enrichment is part of the rights of the @entity5 people , whether we 're talking about 5 % or 20 % ... however , this can be an issue that can create further confidence , " he said			2
@entity18 added that " hostile behaviors " directed toward @entity5 were detrimental to building confidence			1
this was presumably a reference to the draconian sanctions imposed by @entity105 governments against @entity8 , which are crippling the @entity5 economy			0
oil exports have plummeted over the past several years , as has the value of @entity5 's currency			1
" the purpose of any sanctions is to put pressure in order to get this process to work , " said @entity38			0
" and i believe we should continue to work as hard as we possibly can to make sure we are successful and we reach a satisfactory resolution			0
" questions fly around any plan to attack @entity5 the so - called p5 +1 governments are demanding that @entity5 come clean about its nuclear program , which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons			0
@entity5 consistently denies those charges , arguing it is enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs			2
details of last february 's offer from the six countries represented across the negotiating table from @entity5 have not yet been made public			2
last month , technical experts from @entity5 and the p5 +1 countries met for more than 12 hours in @entity178 to discuss the proposal			0
@entity5 's deputy chief negotiator said the @entity5 proposal tabled friday was based on a previous powerpoint presentation that the @entity5 delegation submitted during a round of talks in @entity112 in june 2012			1
" the @entity189 of @entity5 proposed a practical method to implement the @entity112 plan in a smaller scale , " @entity186 said in a statement issued to journalists friday			0
the offer , he said , was aimed at establishing " a new bedrock of cooperation			0
" a call for ' concrete actions ' @entity198 has vowed it will continue to put pressure on @entity8			0
" as long as @entity5 does not take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community about its nuclear program , the dual - track process continues			0
and that pressure only will increase if @entity5 does not begin to take concrete steps and concrete actions , " said a senior @entity63 administration official in a telephone briefing to journalists this week			2
the official spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity5 argues that as a signatory to the @entity215 , development of nuclear technology is an inalienable right			0
on the eve of the two - day talks in @entity9 , @entity18 repeated this position in a speech given at a university in @entity16			1
" it is the right of the @entity5 people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment , " @entity18 said			1
a report recently published by the @entity230 concluded that sanctions are unlikely to force @entity8 to give up its nuclear program			0
the report , titled " @entity5 's @entity233 , " highlighted the fact that @entity8 's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century , beginning under the rule of the pro-american shah , @entity238 , and continuing under the revolutionary @entity240 republic that overthrew him			1
" the program 's cost -- measured in lost foreign investment and oil revenue -- has been well over $ 100 billion , " @entity230 said .			0

" @entity5 's current position falls far short of what is needed , " says @entity80 official
@entity5 has the right to enrich uranium , but negotiation may be possible , @entity18 suggests
it 's clear the two sides " remain far apart " on substance , @entity3 foreign policy chief says
no date or location is agreed upon for new talks between world powers and @entity5
