@entity0 -- @entity2 : the @entity4 bank robber @entity3 once famously answered the question on why he robbed banks with the reply , " because that 's where the money is			1
" the same should be said for @entity0 and the issue of inequality			1
it may stick in @entity13 's throat but it is an undeniable truth that it is the people who are attending @entity0 who can make changes			1
frankly , no amount of shouting and protesting will make any difference if those in charge of policy and agendas are n't persuaded by the arguments and decide to do something			1
and frankly , when it comes to getting all the right people in the same place at the same time , @entity0 is unique			1
in @entity0 during the @entity0 we have government heads like @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
these are the people who can actually get something done			2
there is a reason why @entity38 sent his @entity39 to @entity0 , and who gave us the quote of the day when he said we must ensure " humanity is served by wealth and not ruled by it			1
" this was not a quixotic message ... he knows that if he wants to create the change of greater fairness and equality , those who have power must be on board rather than just bleating about unfairness and hoping someone might listen			1
this is all about reality rather than fantasy ... from the corporate world , there are @entity61 here like @entity63 of @entity64 , @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 and @entity70 's richest man			2
between them they employ hundreds of thousands of people all across the globe			2
their companies set working conditions and wage standards for whole sectors of industry , frequently amongst the low paid			2
where they lead others will follow , creating a multiplier effect out of proportion to their individual company			2
then there are the extra governmental groups like the @entity89 and @entity90 like @entity91 who push these agendas hard			0
@entity91 's conclusion that the 85 richest people own half the world 's wealth generated huge interest			0
the director told me @entity91 came to @entity0 to warn if we do n't break out of this power and wealth privilege and opportunity then it " is dangerous			1
" @entity13 , with all the players in the same place , at the same time this is the perfect venue to raise such issues			1
of course there is the risk that leaders and @entity61 choose to ignore these calls for greater equality			0
if they do that they will be closing their eyes to the warnings from groups like the @entity0 itself			1
in its latest @entity120 @entity0 says inequality is now the greatest threat to global stability			1
" income disparity is also among the most worrying of issues			2
it raises concerns about the @entity127 and the squeezing effect it had on the middle classes in developed economies , " opines the @entity0			1
bearing in mind most companies rely on the middle classes in developed countries to sell goods and services throughout the value chain , dealing with inequality is a matter of brutal enlightened self - interest			2
it 's simple economics : global stability equals global growth equals profits			2
so -- @entity13 -- you tell me a better place where you can advise , consult and ultimately warn those with so much at stake of the risks of doing nothing			2
or perhaps you would like to stand out in the cold			0
i think i would prefer to talk to those who can actually do something			0
@entity157 : from 1,500 meters above sea level you get a great view of the world 's big issues			1
and if you occupy the lofty upper echelons of the ladder -- which many @entity0 attendees do -- the picture 's even clearer right ? wrong			1
you see , @entity167 , while you may consider yourself at home among the world 's 1 % , the very attributes that make a @entity0 guest so ideal -- power and money -- often clash with some of the subjects those very delegates are here to tackle			1
that 's especially true when it comes to this year 's " theme du jour " : inequality			2
of course getting so many of the world 's decision makers in the same room affords its opportunities			0
but when they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo , you have to ask what appetite -- if any -- they would have for change			1
also how credible would their views actually be ? take a look at the thorny subject of executive remuneration , which helps feed today 's inequality spiral and should keep the corporate crowd on their toes this year			2
in the @entity203 , for instance , the average blue chip boss can earn up to a staggering 185 times the salary of their ordinary worker			0
and in the @entity4 , the chasm looms even wider			0
i was surprised to hear the ceo of accountancy firm @entity210 confess to me on air that he had never investigated the gap between his compensation and that of his more junior staff			0
" should you know this ? " i asked			0
he protested that he created jobs all around the world			0
as if that , somehow , makes it okay			0
job creation is a valid argument but it does n't detract from the fact that some @entity0 attendees are so high up the food chain they are either divorced from reality or willfully blind to what does n't affect them			1
until it costs them money or votes , which is why , as you point out @entity167 , the " squeezed middle " has made its way up the agenda , arguably decades too late			0
pope @entity38 ' decision to send a papal envoy to @entity0 was a game changer this year			1
but his message -- read out by @entity242 -- was n't just about lobbying those in power , it was also about making sure those suffering hardship and financial strain are also represented among the @entity0 elites			1
you see recessions and recovery have a habit of treating the " haves " and the " have nots " differently			0
and while those further down an organization are more likely to face the ax when times are lean , they do n't benefit as much as their bosses when business is better			0
but do n't take my word for it , @entity167			0
let the figures speak for themselves			0
@entity91 's report about the top 85 fortunes having a stranglehold over the world 's riches has certainly captured public attention but the trend was already well known			0
a few years ago @entity275 of the @entity276 estimated that between 1988 and 2008 , around the world , the highest earners saw their income rise by 60 % while the lowest 5 % have n't witnessed any uptick at all			0
and that 's just income			0
do n't get me started on the wealth gap , where inheritances , better access to capital and contacts amplify the trend			0
@entity167 , you say you would prefer to talk to " those who matter " but i caution you , one can learn a lot from the 99 % who actually staff their firms and fund their government 's trips to @entity0			1
they do the doing rather than the talking			0
and guess what ? they count just as much			0
global economic recovery feeds growing inequality opinion : will global elite listen to @entity38 of poor ?			1

@entity1 *anchors* @entity304 and @entity305 disagree as to whether @entity0 can make a difference to inequality
quest argues this meeting of power players is the best forum to make big decisions about global issues
@entity316 argues it is *ironic* this is where the *super-rich* are *gathering* -- and wonders if they will create change
do you believe @entity0 can make a difference to global inequality ? tell us in the comments
