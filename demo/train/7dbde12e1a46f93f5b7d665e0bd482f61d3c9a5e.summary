the sweat - stained sheets of @entity5 , the first person diagnosed with @entity6 in the @entity7 , still on her bed , a woman quarantined in a @entity2 apartment said thursday that she desperately wants her family 's nightmare to end			1
" we ca n't wait to be over with everything , " the woman , who asked to be identified only by her first name , @entity12 , told @entity14 's @entity13			1
" we ca n't wait			1
" while @entity5 is in isolation at @entity17 , his partner and three others have been stuck in a @entity2 apartment since his diagnosis this week			2
@entity12 told @entity14 that authorities had her sign paperwork stating " if we step outside , they are going to take us ... to court ( because ) we 'll have committed a crime			2
" so there she has stayed , along with her 13 - year - old son and two nephews in their 20s			0
but it has n't been easy			2
@entity12 told @entity14 's @entity13 by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour , and based on that and everything else , is n't sick			1
she expressed frustration being confined nonetheless , since people are only contagious with @entity6 if they are symptomatic			1
@entity5 's girlfriend has been frustrated in other ways as well			2
she said no one brought food thursday to four people who ca n't leave to get it themselves , at least until later in the day			1
there was also the matter of their power going out , which was likely related to strong storms that rolled through the area			0
then , of course , there 's the idea of living in a place that -- just a few days ago -- was home to an @entity6 sufferer			1
her 35 - year - old daughter brought over @entity58 to help clean the house , and she sealed up @entity5 's dirty clothes and towels in a bag			2
" but ( authorities ) said we should n't throw anything away until they can get back with me , " @entity12 said			2
that had n't happened as of thursday evening			2
men in trucks from @entity70 , a company that specializes in hazmat and biohazard cleaning services , was turned away for lack of the necessary permit to transport hazardous waste on @entity77 highways , it said			0
once everything is cleaned up , even if plenty of food arrives , @entity12 's ordeal is far from over			2
first off , there 's the fact @entity5 -- who flew from @entity85 to visit her and family members -- is still in the hospital , fighting a disease that 's already killed thousands in @entity89			1
and @entity12 , her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when @entity5 first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment			2
that 's because @entity6 can be in a person for that long before it manifests itself , and someone starts to feel sick			1
reflecting on it all , @entity12 said thursday , " i 'm just hanging in there , depending on @entity100 to save our lives			0
" county official : quarantined four should be relocated if it were up to the @entity107 director of homeland security , the four people quarantined should n't be stuck in the apartment at all			1
judge @entity109 , also director of the county 's @entity111 and @entity113 , said officials are working on that relocation after @entity5 's partner told @entity14 of being forced to live with distressing living conditions			1
@entity109 acknowledged " some hygiene issues " in the apartment			0
" i would like to see those people moved to better living conditions , " @entity109 told @entity14 's @entity120 on thursday afternoon			1
" we are working on that			0
i would like to move them five minutes ago			0
" @entity109 acknowledged problems with @entity12 's apartment but defended the overall government response			2
" we have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment , " @entity109 said earlier in the day			0
" those people in the apartment are part of @entity107 , and they 're going to be treated with utmost respect and dignity in this unusual situation			2
" we are working to get the response , which has been a good response , strengthened every hour of the day , " the judge said			2
partner : hospital staff told @entity5 from @entity85 @entity12 , a caregiver , sometimes refers to @entity5 as her husband -- even though they 're not legally married -- @entity14 's @entity13 said			1
when @entity5 arrived in the @entity7 on september 20 , " he did n't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with @entity6 , " @entity12 said			1
nor was he showing any signs of the virus			0
but things changed three days later , when @entity5 got a headache and a fever , according to his partner			2
on september 25 , she took him to @entity17 where , @entity12 said , hospital staff were told twice that @entity5 had come from @entity85			0
but " they did not ask " him anything about @entity6 , including whether he 'd had contact with anyone with the disease in @entity89 , according to @entity12			1
@entity5 was taken by ambulance to the hospital on sunday , september 28 , after @entity12 's 35 - year - old daughter saw him " shaking really hard " and with a fever when she came by to give him tea			0
@entity12 said she went to the hospital herself soon thereafter , seeing @entity5 " through the glass			0
" it was then that health officials first told her that medical officials first told her that her partner may have @entity6			1
" i was so ( scared ) , " @entity12 said			0
your @entity6 questions answered did authorities drop the ball ? so , too , is @entity173			1
but @entity173 does n't want his 13 - year - old son , who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother , @entity12 -- to know that what he 's feeling			1
so every time they talk on the phone , @entity173 said he want " just to encourage him , " not to frighten him			0
" i believe he knows everything , " said @entity173 , who is no longer with the boy 's mother but is still pulling for her			1
" ( there 's ) no need for me to just go and talk about @entity6			1
" @entity188 , @entity5 's half - brother , said his 21 - year - old son is also among those quarantined in @entity12 's apartment , where he lived			1
he said that @entity5 had come to @entity77 to " help his son " and visit his family			0
asked about health authorities have handled the quarantine , including the sweat - stained sheets and lack of food , @entity188 conceded that he 's " skeptical			1
" " that worries me now , yes			0
" he 's not alone			0
dr. @entity200 , a professor at @entity202 's school of public health , called the handling of the quarantine " hair raising			1
" " if , in fact , there was a health worker there every day , what exactly were they doing other than just taking her temperature and leaving ? " @entity200 said			0
" it should have been a whole lot more that ( @entity217 ) should be expecting			0
" @entity6 only spreads through infected bodily fluids			1
and it 's distinctly possible that no one around @entity5 got exposed to his			0
( @entity12 said she did n't think she had			0
) still , @entity14 's dr. @entity220 said the continuing presence of the sheets , on which @entity5 may have transmitted the virus through sweating , are disturbing			0
" we 've talked about the fact that this virus can live outside the body , can live on surfaces			0
it 's unlikely for it to be transmitted to someone else that way , " @entity220 said			0
" but why take a chance ? " @entity220 said that " it is hard to believe ( the oversight ) and there are n't good explanations here			0
" one @entity6 expert , dr. @entity237 , also said the federal response to the first @entity6 case on @entity7 soil seemed troubling			1
" so far , we do n't seem to reacting as well as we could , " he said			0

@entity243 says he does n't want quarantined boy to know that he 's scared
expert : it 's " hair raising " quarantined people were n't told more
partner of man with @entity6 says " we ca n't wait " for quarantine to end
judge wants to see quarantined family " moved to better living conditions "
