@entity0 -- a @entity5 man sentenced in an @entity7 court to a 16 - year prison term in absentia over deaths of about 2,000 workers who prosecutors said were exposed to asbestos will appeal the ruling , his lawyer said tuesday			1
@entity15 , the @entity5 owner of the fiber - cement firm @entity16 , was sentenced monday alongside @entity18 former executive and investor @entity21 @entity20			1
the pair were accused of failing to protect workers in the company 's four @entity7 factories before they were shuttered in 1986			1
@entity15 's lawyer , @entity26 , told @entity1 tuesday that his client did not accept the sentence handed down by the court in @entity30 , an industrial hub in northwestern @entity7			1
" the sentence is certainly a setback , we lost the first battle			0
( it 's ) a defeat that we do n't accept and we will present an appeal , " the lawyer said			2
he said @entity15 had invested large sums in the 1970s in restructuring the plants ' production process and had never set foot in @entity7			1
" the sentence is dangerous because if in @entity7 we affirm the principle that the major shareholder of a multinational company is responsible for what happens in each peripheral plant , no one will invest in @entity7 any longer , " he said			2
@entity15 and @entity51 were also ordered to pay a total of â ‚ ¬ 80 million ( $ 105 million ) to more than 6,000 people , including former workers and residents who lived near their plants			2
@entity57 , the leader of @entity7 's asbestos victims association , said more than 1,500 people attended monday 's hearing -- including some who were suffering from asbestos - linked illnesses			1
" it was a very emotional moment , " @entity57 said			0
" people were crying because of tension and then of happiness			0
" @entity67 , @entity7 's health minister , called the sentence " historic			2
" the @entity7 eternit company was declared bankrupt in 1986 , when the @entity7 plants were shut down , and the company 's ownership changed in the 1990s			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 @entity16 company , @entity75 , said it was independent from the @entity7 firm of the same name			0
" neither eternit ( schweiz ) ag nor its owner had or have any relationship with @entity82 , @entity83 , and thus with the subject of the criminal proceedings in @entity30 , " @entity75 said			0
asbestos was once widely used as a fireproofing material and was included in roof shingles and siding for decades			0
though now banned in @entity7 and most western countries , asbestos is still used in developing countries , mainly in @entity93 and @entity94			0
exposure to its tiny fibers , particularly over a period of time , can lead to asbestos - related diseases that include lung cancer , asbestosis and mesothelioma , according to the @entity103 .			1

@entity15 will appeal his sentence in an @entity7 court , his lawyer says
@entity15 and a @entity18 *colleague* are accused of failing to protect workers from asbestos
@entity15 's lawyer says the sentence will deter other big firms from investing in @entity7
