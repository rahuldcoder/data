@entity0 -- a custody battle involving the " best interests " of a 3 - year - old @entity5 girl will be taken up by the @entity7 @entity6 , an issue spanning the rights of adoptive parents and the desire to preserve @entity13 families within tribes			1
the justices announced they will hear an appeal from @entity17 and @entity18 , who legally adopted little @entity19 in 2009 , shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child			1
oral arguments in the case will likely be heard in april with a ruling by late june			1
the @entity25 in july ruled for the biological father , who had sought custody shortly after the child 's birth			1
he is a registered member of the @entity30 and is raising the child in @entity32			0
@entity33 had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption , but his attorneys say the father did not understand the extent of the waiver , and that the birth mother misrepresented the child 's @entity43 heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized			2
at issue is whether @entity33 , as the onetime non-custodial father , can gain parental custody , after the @entity51 mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe			2
a special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions , since the current 556 federally recognized tribes all fall under @entity58 oversight , giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights			2
lawyers for the @entity63 say federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a " parent			1
" the adoptive couple was excited that the high court will hear their case			1
" we were n't sure what to expect , " @entity18 told @entity1 's @entity70			2
" it was a low chance and we just feel really extremely happy that they decided to hear it			2
" her husband , @entity17 , added , " it restored some hope and a little faith in the judicial system			0
" the federal law in question is the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) of 1978 , a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families , in many cases to @entity51 homes			1
who 's a @entity13 ? it 's complicated the legislation was designed to " promote the stability and security of @entity5 tribes and @entity5 families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of @entity5 children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of @entity5 families are followed in child custody proceedings			1
" @entity33 's relationship within the " federally recognized government " of the @entity30 means @entity19 -- named in court papers as " @entity111 " -- is a member of the tribe and subject to their jurisdiction			2
" it 's not anyone 's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home , " said @entity116 , the @entity117 , @entity32 - based tribe 's attorney general			0
" but we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be @entity5 homes first			2
" still , the @entity63 argue that the little girl 's real home is with them			0
" @entity19 was always a part of our home from birth and we just felt like she was in a happy place and that those kinds of needs could have been met through us , " @entity18 said			0
" i just do n't think that was what @entity138 was thinking about when that act was passed			0
" as with many custody fights , there is wide factual disagreement over the circumstances of both the couple 's breakup and subsequent adoption of the child			1
opposing sides even disagree on what legal issues the high court should address			1
the @entity63 think the issue should be about whether the @entity82 law can improperly block adoption proceedings voluntarily initiated by a @entity51 mother who had sole custody of her child , due to what the adoptive parents say is the @entity5 father 's failure to establish a legal parent - child relationship under state law			1
but @entity33 argues he successfully established paternity under state law , and qualifies as a " parent " under the @entity82 , thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter			1
opinion : should race be a factor in adoption ? he said in legal papers that the child was conceived when the couple was engaged , and " excited " he would be a father			0
but @entity33 claims the biological mother broke off the now - strained relationship by text message			0
he agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support , but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption			0
and @entity33 claims the biological mother tried to " conceal " his @entity5 heritage during the adoption process with the @entity63 , who live in @entity192 , @entity193			1
establishing such heritage would normally make it very difficult for the @entity30 and state social services to agree to any @entity51 adoption and removal from the state			0
by this time , @entity33 was deployed to @entity200 on a one - year deployment in the @entity202 , making it hard to press his custody claims			0
@entity19 lived with the @entity63 for two years before the high court in @entity193 ruled for the father			1
@entity33 took his daughter back to @entity208 , @entity32 , on @entity209 2011			0
the state 's top court that ruled in his favor said @entity33 had " a deeply embedded relationship " with his @entity43 heritage , in which @entity19 will be raised			2
but the @entity63 point to another part of the state court 's conclusion : that despite a ruling against them , they were " ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment			1
" that court said its hands were tied , and that federal law trumped state law			1
" courts in seven states have held that @entity82 does not bar courts from terminating the parental rights of a non-custodial father under state law when the father abandoned his child to the sole custody of a @entity51 mother , " said @entity226 , attorney for the couple			1
she says the father 's initial agreement to give up his parental rights meant he forfeited any subsequent efforts to establish custody , when the child was already in a happy , stable home environment			1
the @entity63 argue @entity33 had refused to offer any financial assistance to the biological mother until they were married and " wanted nothing to do " with the pregnancy			0
as a single mother with two other young children , the biological mother felt she had no choice but to give her daughter up for adoption , said a legal brief filed by her lawyers			2
they say she complied with the adoption laws in both states and with the tribe			0
the couple also says they long wanted to be parents and had seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization			0
she is a child developmental psychologist and he is an automotive body technician			0
they were in the room when @entity19 was born , and had an " open " adoption , meaning the biological mother could and did maintain a relationship with @entity19			0
the case is @entity274 , a @entity275 ( 12 - 399 ) .			0

new : @entity193 couple says it is happy that the high court will hear their appeal
@entity5 man won custody of his biological daughter
@entity6 couple 's appeal will be heard by high court
a federal law meant to *protect* @entity5 family breakup is key to the case
