@entity0 -- this is not worksafe			0
it 's a hyperlink to @entity4 , the pornographic fiberglass creation of @entity7 contemporary artist @entity6			1
to spare you the mouse click , here 's the description			0
@entity4 is an anime - type character with monstrously huge lactating breasts that are spilling out of her bikini			2
she is both sick and ridiculous , a sculpture that -- i will admit -- makes me wince and laugh at the same time			0
this supersized fantasy figurine sold at an auction in 2002 for $ 427,500 and helped transform @entity6 into a globally recognized art - world rock star			1
so when i sat down to interview the artist at the @entity24 in @entity0 , i had to ask him what the hardcore @entity4 was all about			2
was it a work of social satire ? was he criticizing anime culture by exposing its often lustful portrayal of women as objects ? not at all , says @entity6			1
it 's just a celebration of his teen years as a self - described otaku			0
" i became an otaku when i was in high school and absorbed many different things from anime like its erotic and fantasy elements ... that very process resulted in that work , " he says , adding that his art is about finding his true self			1
@entity6 is one of @entity49 's hottest contemporary artists and an international art - world phenomenon			1
he 's known for an approach called " superflat " -- a technique that combines high art and anime , while employing flat planes of color			1
the superflat movement propelled @entity6 to fame in the 1990s and eventually caught the eye of designer @entity61			1
in 2002 , @entity61 , as creative director of @entity63 , collaborated with @entity6 to update the traditional @entity63 logo			1
the handbag collection became a defining accessory of the decade			0
@entity6 made his mark in a decade of excess marked by bling , botox and @entity72			2
but even in that era of gloss and luxury spin , he used his superflat language to bare his innermost feelings and urges			0
there 's an honesty to his work , however plastic or shiny they appear			0
so @entity4 , along with his other otaku fantasies in fiberglass like @entity84 , is what it is -- an adolescent wet dream made real			0
even @entity6 's dazzling use of color comes from a true awkward moment of his past -- a teenage desire to please the hot girl in class			1
" when i was doing painting as a freshman in university , an older female student came and told me that i severely lacked a sense of color , " says @entity6			1
" it just so happened that her boyfriend was known for his outstanding sense of color			0
" " you can imagine , as i was hoping to make a living as a painter , how upset that comment made me ! from that day on , i started studying the fundamentals of color			0
" a desire to please led to a love of dazzling color and his signature psychedelic color palette			1
a geeky love of sci - fi led to his universe of superflat creations like mr. @entity116 , smiley - faced flowers and colorful mushrooms			0
and a willingness to bare his anime - fueled fantasies -- no matter how grotesque -- led to his super-sized figurines			2
if you happen to be in @entity0 , you can get up close and personal with @entity6 's work at his latest exhibition , " @entity126 , " at the @entity127 now until february 9			2
( just look out for all the carefully - rendered nose hairs in his superflat self - portraits featured in the video above			0
