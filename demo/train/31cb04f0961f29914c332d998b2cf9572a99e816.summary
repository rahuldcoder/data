@entity1 " @entity0 acted like he 'd been here before , like jumping from a plane is as easy as falling off a log			1
maybe that 's because he had -- 70 years ago			0
" i 'm feeling fine , " @entity0 told reporters moments after landing in a @entity7 field			1
" ... it was wonderful , absolutely wonderful			0
" @entity0 was part of the @entity11 @entity10 that parachuted down over @entity12 in their bid to retake @entity7 and , eventually , the rest of @entity16 from @entity17			1
they actually touched down in enemy - controlled territory a night before what 's referred to as @entity21			2
his jump thursday in the same area was different and -- despite his being 93 years old now -- a whole lot easier			1
" it did n't ( compare ) , " @entity0 said , " because there was n't anybody shooting at me today			1
" every year , every day it seems , the number of surviving @entity31 veterans like @entity0 dwindles			1
he estimates there are only a few dozen members of his unit who took part in the now historic d - day invasion who are still around			1
share your family 's d - day stories it 's ironic , in a sense , because @entity0 was among the oldest of his bunch in june 1944 -- at 23 years old -- surrounded by others who were mere teenagers			1
together , they parachuted onto @entity7 's northern coast in the dark of night not knowing what awaited them			2
whatever it was , it would not be friendly or easy , they expected			0
" everybody ( was ) scared all the time , and if they tell you anything differently they are full of crap , " the former paratrooper recalled			0
" but you just do what you had to do regardless of it			0
" and they did n't stop			2
according to a @entity68 page he regularly updates , @entity0 fought for 43 days as part of the @entity71 campaign before moving onto invade @entity72 , fending off @entity17 fighters during the @entity74 and finishing off by taking @entity75 , site of @entity78 's " @entity80 " redoubt in the @entity79			1
none of it was easy , but @entity0 insists , " i do n't ever have flashbacks			1
" all these years later , he has become a celebrity of sorts -- as evidenced by a mob of reporters who greeted him after his parachute landing thursday			0
@entity0 says he feels " kind of humbled and embarrassed at the adulation because i do n't feel we did anything that we were n't supposed to do or anything exceptional			1
" he adds : " we just did what we trained to do			0
" seven decades later , @entity0 did it again -- not fighting a bloody war but at least reliving his role in a military campaign that changed the course of history			2
others joined him in this now daytime jump , though he was the only one from his generation			0
this time , he said that he was n't scared because , " once you get in the plane , you forget everything			2
" bored would be more like it			0
as he told reporters afterward , " to tell you the truth , riding around in the plane is boring			0
it 's when you get off the plane , that 's when it gets exciting ... but there 's no fear to it			0
it 's just something you do			0
" @entity0 admitted that he was motivated by " a little bit of ego , ( to show that ) i 'm 93 and i can still do it			1
" " and also i just want to show all the people that you do n't have to sit and die just because you get old , " he added			1
" among those things he 'd like to do is another jump in the same plane , one year from now			2
" if i come back next year , i 'll make a jump next year			0
you can bet on it			0

@entity0 was in the @entity11 @entity10 , and parachuted into @entity71
he parachutes from a plane again into the same area again , at the age of 93
it did n't compare to his d - day jump " because there was n't anybody shooting "
@entity0 wants to show " you do n't have to sit and die just because you get old "
