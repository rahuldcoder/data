the saying goes : " @entity1 heals all wounds			0
" and for most former @entity5 presidents , that appears to be true			2
after leaving the constant scrutiny of the @entity9 , a president 's legacy begins to take shape as professors , biographers and presidential historians start to take long , reflective looks at the president 's time in office			1
and that prism generally makes them look better			0
. " history has a way of making presidents , in most cases , look better than they looked during their administration , " said @entity20 , director of the @entity21 at @entity22			2
@entity29 , whose library opened on thursday , is in the middle of that sort of mini-renaissance -- the number of people who see his presidency as a failure , according to a recent @entity41 / @entity40 poll , is down 13 points since he left office			1
and he 's not unique in that sense -- a @entity46 poll released thursday showed presidents @entity47 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 all with an improved approval rating in retirement			1
five presidents on hand for @entity29 library ceremonies but why does this happen ? historians say a number of factors -- from the way the president left office to the human tendency to forgive -- contribute to how the former leader is viewed			1
and while all of these factors do n't apply to every president , the historians say a combination of these factors play into how a retired commander - in - chief is perceived			0
how did you leave the @entity9 ? when president @entity76 exited the @entity9 in 1933 , the country was in the midst of the @entity78			2
when @entity80 left after one term , his polices to maintain peace between the @entity83 had failed and the @entity84 was imminent			2
and when president @entity87 resigned the @entity9 in 1974 because of the @entity88 , the former @entity86 lawmaker left as a disgraced public figure			1
according to @entity90 , a presidential historian and expert on president @entity92 , the way a president exits the @entity9 plays a big role in how their leadership is remembered			1
" if something cataclysmic happens just before they leave office , they end up having a tough time recovering , " @entity97 said			2
most people , said @entity97 , have very little recollection of the specifics of a former president , so the most memorable moments are what stick			0
although @entity87 may have helped normalize relations with @entity112 when he became the first president to visit the @entity115 country , and established the @entity116 , @entity97 said , what people remember is his resignation speech , his final wave to the @entity9 and the phrase " i am not a crook			2
" " in many respects , if you look at @entity87 's record , he was a fairly successful president , " @entity97 said			0
" the problem for @entity87 was the way he left the presidency			0
" @entity29 43 reflects on his presidency what did you do after the @entity9 ? two years after having lost the @entity9 to @entity50 , @entity49 established the @entity129 in @entity130 in 1982			1
dedicated to democracy and human rights , the center has helped @entity49 's reputation so much that @entity135 , professor of history at @entity136 , said that @entity49 may have more respect now than he had when he lost the @entity9			1
" it matters how you handle your post-presidency , " @entity135 said			0
" @entity49 is the ace figure to that			2
@entity49 had very low approval when he left office but sort of transformed himself			1
" a report by @entity145 at the @entity146 notes a similar phenomenon for @entity49			2
though @entity49 was the first incumbent president to lose the presidency in half a century , " to many people , @entity49 has provided @entity5 with an ideal model of post-presidential life			2
" " in fact , some consider him to be the nation 's greatest former president , " the report said			0
the successful former president is a more modern tradition , when presidents have a longer life expectancy than their predecessors			0
two other modern presidents who have benefited from life after the @entity9 : @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity52 left office beleaguered by the monica lewinsky scandal but reinvented himself into a @entity165 kingmaker of sorts			1
with his wife now a former secretary of state and his support of president @entity171 through the 2012 election , @entity52 's image has benefited from life after the @entity174			1
and the first of the two bushes elected to the @entity9 has also seen his image improve , @entity135 said			1
" when he was defeated in 1992 , his legacy looks unclear			0
now he seems like this compassionate guy and his image improved during his son 's presidency , " he said			1
remembering 43 : ' @entity29 tended to ... follow strong people ' libraries also make the president look good ever since president @entity188 donated his personal and presidential papers to the federal government in 1939 , the tradition of the presidential library has blossomed			1
part library , part museum , part tribute , each presidential library is a testament to the time each former president spent in the @entity9			1
and according to @entity20 , libraries help rehabilitate a presidential image			1
" these libraries , i think , are bias , " @entity20 said			0
" they want to protect the history , but they also want to make the president look good			0
" one of @entity20 's examples : " if you go to the @entity206 , there is only one small newspaper article that describes the fact that he was the one who decided to use the atomic bomb			0
that is probably the most important thing in his administration and it is sort of hidden			0
he and those protecting his image do n't want that to be the major thing			0
" so far , there are 13 official presidential libraries in the @entity5 with a handful that are not recognized by @entity225			1
@entity97 echoed @entity20 by saying " the presidential library undoubtedly helps			2
" the reason : the public tends to be more forgiving when they see the accomplishments of a presidency laid out in front of them			0
" historians just love to tell good stories , " @entity97 said			0
" outside of @entity237 and a few other people , historians hate to make people just sound awful			0
" he concluded : " it is almost in the interest of people in my profession to find good things about people and underline and them			0

image of most recent presidents improved after they left office
how they left the @entity9 plays a large part in image rehabilitation
one historian thinks @entity49 's image is better now than when in office
presidential libraries are part library , part museum and part *booster*
