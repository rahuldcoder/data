on thursday , the @entity0 released its " @entity5 " to integrate drones into civilian airspace by 2015 , and it provoked strong reactions from privacy advocates			1
i 've been a vocal critic against the creation of lethally autonomous combat drones , so you might expect i 'd be concerned about the vague civilian privacy protections the @entity0 proposed for their six domestic drone test sites			1
but actually i think their approach is a good one			2
@entity0 administrator @entity14 rightly pointed out that his organization is focused on maintaining aviation safety and not proposing new privacy regulations			1
the 74 - page @entity0 civilian drone road map focuses a lot on developing " sense and avoid " technology to enable civilian drones to operate safely in skies already crowded with manned aircraft			1
but each of the test sites will come up with its own drone privacy policies and make them public , to ( as the @entity0 put it ) " help inform the dialogue			1
" consider that last statement the starting gun for what promises to be a vociferous and active debate on robotic vehicles in an open society			2
this is a debate that needs to happen , and with the @entity0 establishing these six " sand boxes " in which to practice various drone privacy approaches , we 'll see the good , the bad and the just plain ugly well before regulations are more widely adopted			1
that might sound messy , but this is how an open society should ingest revolutionary technologies -- by arguing like hell about them			2
and make no mistake , there will be a constituency speaking on behalf of drones			0
that 's because in the next three years , civilian drones -- that is unmanned aerial systems -- could be a $ 10 billion industry ( with part of that presumably spent on public relations )			1
and on both sides of this struggle , the first combatants will be legions of lawyers arguing drone law and establishing legal precedents in local , state and federal courts			0
few will remember that at the birth of aviation , property laws were such that landowners owned the air above their heads , too -- theoretically all the way up into space			0
and landowners were not happy with the idea of aircraft noisily " trespassing " over their property , and yet it was difficult for aviators to fly only over public right - of - ways , especially in poor weather conditions			0
what followed were legal battles , with one railroad trying to stop rival airmail by claiming " aerial trespass " if aviators followed their rail lines			0
there was aviation litigation about wrongful deaths , noise pollution , canceled flights , air crew working conditions , deferred maintenance , etc. eventually all that debate , legal precedent and working knowledge was boiled down into a regulatory framework that became the @entity0			1
few would argue that @entity0 regulation has harmed the aviation industry or society			2
just ask yourself if you 'd be willing to step on an unregulated commercial aircraft			0
those regulations made a level playing field for airlines and allowed the entire industry to prosper while simultaneously benefiting the public			0
but getting there was n't pretty			0
and so it will be with civilian drones			1
it will take the passionate debate of civil rights activists , entrepreneurs , hobbyists , aerospace engineers , farmers , environmentalists , ethicists and many more for society to arrive at a stable legal framework to safely and equitably integrate robotic aviation and autonomous vehicles into our society			0
there is no agency or bureau that will do this for us , and these are thorny issues			0
for every privacy activist i agree with on the subject of drones , there is also someone with a compelling vision of how they could be used for good , such as entrepreneurs who envision precision agriculture drones that could reduce pesticide use through surgically precise and infinitely patient ministering to crops			2
agriculture alone could represent 80 % of the civilian drone industry			2
and as one drone industry executive put it : " corn does n't mind if you watch it			0
" in case you missed the starting gun for the civilian drone privacy debate , it 's just been sounded .			1

@entity170 : @entity0 releases road map for drones in civilian airspace by 2015
he says privacy advocates complain but believes @entity0 's approach is sound
he says civilian drones *inevitable* and useful ; we must hash out best *guidelines*
@entity170 : outcry over aircraft *resulted* in formation of @entity0 ; drone debate is necessary
