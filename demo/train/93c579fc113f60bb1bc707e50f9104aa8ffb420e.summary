@entity0 -- pounding his fist on the witness stand thursday , real - estate developer @entity2 , 73 , described the day he came face - to - face with @entity0 's alleged @entity7 mob kingpin @entity6			1
@entity6 is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades			1
he also faces charges of extortion , racketeering and money laundering			2
he had called @entity14 to a meeting to discuss the positioning of a fence on a property bulger associate @entity18 wanted to buy , @entity2 said			1
he said they had barely sat down when @entity6 banged on the table and told @entity2 , " you know @entity22 , sometimes you should just keep your mouth shut			1
you know @entity18 is like a surrogate son			2
" @entity2 's opinion on the positioning of the fence was not favorable to weeks			1
raising two fingers to his mouth to demonstrate , @entity2 said @entity6 " takes a shotgun off the table and sticks it in my mouth			1
then he took it out , punched me in the shoulder and said , ' @entity2 you 're a stand - up guy			1
i 'm not going to kill you			2
" but then , he said , @entity6 " puts a 45 to my head " and demands $ 200,000 in 30 days , " threatening to kill me and my family			1
" @entity2 said he cut a check for the 200 - grand , which @entity6 's henchman , @entity40 cashed days later			1
@entity2 said he had to give a @entity45 bank teller verbal permission to cash the gargantuan check			1
@entity40 finished up his six days of testimony thursday			2
he described a decades - long journey that included extortion , meetings with @entity53 agents and slayings			2
@entity40 testified he was by @entity6 's side for most of it , saying both were @entity53 informants			1
he described hundreds of occasions when he and @entity6 met with @entity53 agents			1
the defense suggested wednesday that @entity40 would say anything to sweeten his deal with prosecutors and possibly get out of prison , even though the government has never raised that as a possibility			2
@entity40 was arrested in 1995 , was found guilty and was sentenced in 2001 to 10 years in prison for extortion and money laundering			0
in 2003 he pleaded guilty 10 murders and was sentenced to life in prison			0
@entity6 attorney @entity73 asked @entity40 whether he hoped to get out of prison one day , and @entity40 said , " i 'm still alive			1
" @entity73 also highlighted @entity40 's relatively comfortable living conditions			0
" it 's like the @entity79 of federal facilities , " he said			0
" you really think so ? " @entity40 responded , apparently incredulous , about the undisclosed prison			0
@entity73 also asked about an apparent delicatessen on the premises serving salmon , steak , and smoked oysters			0
@entity40 denied such a place exists , saying , " if i fed some of that food to my dog , he 'd bite me			0
" he then complained about the @entity93 prison meal saying disgustedly , " the hotdogs were burned			0
" @entity40 was spared the death penalty on the 10 murder charge after agreeing to testify against @entity6 and his disgraced @entity53 informant handler , @entity98			1
authorities say @entity98 accepted thousands of dollars from @entity6 and his crew in payoffs and , in turn , tipped them off to law enforcement activity			1
@entity98 was convicted of federal and state crimes and is serving 40 years in @entity107			0
under @entity40 's plea deal , the government allowed him to keep numerous properties including a home , at least four condos and a coin laundry			0
despite @entity98 's conviction and @entity40 's testimony , @entity6 's lawyers have argued in this trial that he was not an @entity53 informant			1
authorities say @entity98 , who was raised in the same housing projects as @entity6 , cut a deal with the alleged mob figure in 1975			1
@entity6 would give information about the @entity125 mob -- the @entity53 's prime target -- while @entity6 , authorities said , got names of rival gang members and other informants who had dirt on him			1
he is accused of killing those people			0
without that @entity53 protection , prosecutors say , @entity6 and @entity40 's reign of terror would not have been as successful or lasted as long as it did , from the early 1970s through the mid- 1990s			1
@entity6 rose to the top of the notorious @entity138 gang , prosecutors say , before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after the crooked @entity53 agent told him in december 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges			1
he was captured in @entity143 , @entity144 , two years ago , living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city			0
the girlfriend , @entity149 , was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture			0
at his arraignment in july 2011 he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts			0
through his lawyers , the 83 - year - old defendant had argued he was given immunity by the @entity53 and a former prosecutor			2
the judge dismissed the claim , saying any purported immunity was not a defense against crimes @entity6 faces			1
prosecutors plan to call two more witness friday , and expect to rest their case on the 30th day of trial			0
the defenses amended witness list , which was cut virtually in half to 32 witnesses last week , was whittled down to a potential 16 witnesses after judge @entity173 ruled some witnesses irrelevant and the defense withdrew a handful			0
the list is subject to further change			0
among those virtually certain to testify are four @entity53 agents who the defense says will testify @entity6 was not an informant for @entity53 in @entity0			1
the government argued that @entity6 is not " charged " with being an informant and the testimony could confuse jurors			1
but @entity186 said that , " given the centrality of the government 's allegation of @entity6 being an informant to all of the matters in this case , i think those are proper witnesses			1
" also on the stand thursday afternoon was bar owner @entity193 , one of the @entity194 in " @entity195 , " an establishment that doubled as one of @entity6 's many headquarters in the 1970s and ' 80s			2
@entity193 said he had @entity200 on the payroll , but he was never an employee			0
when prosecuting attorney @entity202 asked why he was on the payroll , @entity193 responded , " he asked			0
" @entity202 : " why did n't you say ' no ' " ? @entity193 : " i did n't think it was smart			0
" @entity193 testified that in @entity207 of 1994 he got a call from @entity98 , who said , " get ahold of the kid because his friend has a problem			0
" in rapid - fire questioning , @entity202 asked , @entity214 ? -- " @entity18 " ; the friend ? -- " @entity200 " ; the problem ? -- " i believe indictments			2
" @entity193 testified that he then saw @entity98 talking to @entity18 shortly after that call			0
@entity193 said he never saw @entity200 again after that day			0
prosecutors say @entity98 tipped @entity6 off to a 1995 indictment , causing @entity6 to go on the run , landing himself on the @entity53 's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in @entity144			2
besides the slayings , @entity6 is accused of using violence , force and threats to shake down @entity0 's bookmakers , loan sharks and drug dealers			2
the @entity7 mob allegedly laundered its ill - gotten gains though liquor stores , bars and other property it owned in @entity0			2
@entity1 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

real - estate developer @entity2 says " @entity6 put a gun to his head
he says it *happened* as part of a *dispute* about the placement of a fence
@entity2 : @entity6 demanded $ 200,000 , " threatening to kill me and my family "
