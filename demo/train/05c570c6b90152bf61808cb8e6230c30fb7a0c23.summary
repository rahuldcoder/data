@entity0 , @entity1 -- getting to @entity1 , a tiny country wedged in the mountains between @entity5 and @entity6 , is no easy feat. no airport , no train station , and the nearest city @entity11 is at least a 2 hour drive away			1
@entity1 , a beautiful mini-country in the @entity14 , offers its residents a peaceful life			1
perhaps that 's part of the secret of this tiny principality high up in the @entity14 : that its quiet isolation has created a relatively stress - free life - style which has made them the world champions in the global longevity sweepstakes , at least according to the latest @entity26 @entity25 estimates			2
the average @entity1 today can expect to live at least 85 years -- longer than anywhere else on the planet			1
meeting @entity1 from all walks of life , it soon becomes clear that the concept of living longer was not on everyone 's mind , but the idea of living well and living healthy came up in nearly every conversation			1
from doctors in town to the elderly shepherd in the mountains , they speak of eating good natural food and of the exercise which comes naturally in walking up and down the hillsides			0
dr. @entity46 , director of @entity1 's @entity47 , is convinced that living in the mountains is , in general , healthier both for mind and body : " it 's because we have this natural environment that we have such a balanced health , " he told @entity2			1
watch a report on the secrets of long life in @entity1 Â» elderly @entity1 have a daily routine that would put much younger people in the shade : outside their @entity60 , a group of about 30 senior citizens in their 80 's and 90 's out for a cold morning 's walk went slowly but surely and easily negotiated two or three flights of stairs built into the mountainside			2
after that ' warm - up ' most of them headed for the gym for stationary bike riding and exercise class			0
diet and nutrition awareness also seems to play a role in keeping @entity1 alive and healthy			1
nestled in valleys between @entity5 and @entity6 , there is very little cultivatable land and strangely enough , tobacco seems to be one of the few crops raised on the little farmland in the country			1
but meat , vegetables and fish from its larger neighbors make their way to the dinner tables in @entity1 , resulting in a high - altitude version of the @entity93 diet so many strive for elsewhere			1
but even in this land - locked little country , times are changing and the older generation worries that the slow invasion of fast food and the passivity of video games and the like , may have a negative impact on the life expectancy of the young			0
seventy - six - year old farmer @entity106 remembers the days when just taking his herd of cattle to pastures and back home again would easily mean hiking 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) up and down the mountain trails each day			0
a new lifestyle has come to the principality , the old farmer told @entity2			0
skiing and tourism are the country 's new profit centers , life is getting increasingly stressful , more people are eating fast food instead of the traditional diet and not getting enough exercise , he added			2
it would seem that the secrets to long life in @entity1 are not really secrets at all			2
good health care , clean water , proper diet , plenty of exercise and a low - stress , positive life however , there 's one other thing to consider when trying to understand the @entity1 's penchant for life and living long : the feeling of community and an unusual closeness to friends and family			1
filming at an elderly care home , it was full of families including young children spending an hour or two on a weekday with an aged parent or grandparent			0
and even to stop to ask a question or a direction , people seemed to know about everything and everyone else in the country			0
some might find that intrusive , or even boring			0
but there seemed to be a marked sense of peace in the way people here see life			0
dr. @entity46 thinks there is a specific reason for that sense of happiness in @entity1 : " we do n't have any violence			2
i think it 's one of the safest countries in the world			0
" " and after all , " one @entity1 told @entity2 , " unlike the rest of @entity177 , we have n't been touched by a war in more than 700 years			1

the average @entity1 lives 85 years , longer than anywhere else on the planet
