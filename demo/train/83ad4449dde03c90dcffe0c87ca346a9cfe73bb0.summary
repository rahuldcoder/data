-- several prominent civil rights groups filed a class action lawsuit friday challenging @entity4 's new anti-illegal immigration law , the latest such legal effort aimed at similar bills passed in various states			1
the suit claims the recently passed @entity16 56 " endangers public safety , invites the racial profiling of @entity11 , @entity12 and others who appear foreign to an officer , and interferes with federal law , " according to a press release friday sent by the @entity18			1
that group allied with several other groups , including the @entity21 , @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity23			2
their lawsuit was filed in the @entity25 for @entity26			0
@entity27 , the @entity18 's legal director , told @entity0 that she believed the law is " radical " -- even more so than similar bills enacted in @entity31 and @entity32 , for instance -- and sent a clear , unwelcoming message to immigrants			1
" we hope the law never goes into effect , " said @entity27			0
the @entity4 legislation , known as @entity16 , was passed and signed by gov. @entity40 last month and is set to take effect on september 1			1
@entity40 's spokeswoman , @entity42 , issued a statement friday standing behind the bill			1
" gov. @entity40 campaigned on the need for a strong immigration bill , " said @entity45			0
" the legislature passed that bill , and the governor signed it			1
" @entity51 , a spokeswoman for @entity4 attorney general @entity52 , said by e-mail friday afternoon that her office had yet to get a copy of the complaint , and thus had no comment on the specifics			2
regardless , she said the attorney general planned to defend the controversial measure			0
" under state law , acts of our legislature are presumed to be constitutional , and it is the duty of this office to defend them , and we will do so , " said @entity60			0
while immigration had long been a federal responsibility , other anti-illegal immigration measures have been passed in recent months in @entity31 , @entity70 , @entity32 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
parts of those laws have been suspended in four of those states , pending resolutions to the lawsuits			0
last month , a federal judge struck down a key part of the @entity32 law in deciding police can not inquire about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations			1
@entity4 's law has a similar provision			1
according to a fact sheet presented by @entity89 , the bill requires law enforcement officers " to attempt to determine the immigration status of a person who they suspect is an unauthorized alien of this country			2
" the legislation also makes it a criminal offense to transport or house to an illegal immigrant			2
the state will have to check the citizenship of students , and any business that knowingly employs an illegal immigrant will be penalized			0
@entity107 state rep. @entity106 told @entity0 in june that the legislation is " good for @entity4 " because it will reduce illegal immigration to the state and " provide equal opportunities for all people who want to come to @entity4 legally			2
" he rejected suggestions the law is discriminatory , saying he is confident it was drafted in such a way that it will survive legal challenges			0
but several civil rights advocates called the @entity4 bill unconstitutional and unfair , vowing in the @entity18 's press release to fight it in court on a number of grounds			1
@entity123 , an attorney with the @entity22 , called it the " harshest version " of the laws that have followed @entity31 's pioneering measure			2
among other aspects , the measure will " turn teachers , landlords and community members into de facto immigration enforcement agents , " claimed @entity128 of the @entity20			0
@entity135 , the executive director of the @entity21 in @entity4 , said the bill marks a big step backward for the state , which had been central in the civil rights movement			1
" in the nearly 50 years since the historical and worldwide movement for civil and human rights began in our state , real progress has been made , " said @entity135			0
" but this law threatens to pull us back to a dark and shameful past -- and one in which all @entity149 were held back			0
" @entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
