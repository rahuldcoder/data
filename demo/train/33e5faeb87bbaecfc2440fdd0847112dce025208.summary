allegations of endemic doping within @entity3 athletics revealed in a @entity5 documentary are to be investigated by the @entity6			1
the @entity8 documentary broadcast by @entity10 / @entity9 alleged @entity3 officials covered up positive drugs tests in return for financial reward , that athletes traveled under assumed names to avoid doping programs and if they had failed tests they would n't be allowed to compete in major events			1
according to the @entity21 transcript , provided by @entity8 , former @entity3 discus thrower @entity22 -- currently serving a 10 - year doping ban -- alleged in an interview for the program that " most of " @entity3 athletes were doping			1
she told " @entity29 : how @entity3 produces its winners : " the greater part			2
and you get absolutely anything			0
and the shorter the period it can be detected , the more expensive the product			0
" the @entity6 , or @entity38 , said it had seen the allegations and " will ensure that all matters raised are fully investigated			1
" @entity6 has in fact already received some information and evidence of the type exposed in the documentary , " the anti-doping organization said in a statement			1
" all of that information has been passed to the appropriate independent body within the international federation , the @entity49 , " added the @entity6 statement , referring to the @entity49 , the governing body for athletics			1
" we will await the outcome of that independent body 's deliberations			2
the anti-doping body promised that if " action is warranted , @entity6 will take any necessary and appropriate steps under the @entity59			2
" the @entity60 ( @entity61 ) announced it would also be launching an investigation into the allegations friday			2
however , the day before @entity3 athletics federation president @entity64 , who is also the treasure of the @entity49 , told @entity67 news agency the documentary 's allegations were a " pack of lies			1
" @entity3 came top of the medal table at the winter olympics in @entity75 this year and of their tested athletes none provide positive tests			1
one of the athletes interviewed in the one - hour documentary , @entity81 -- a former @entity83 and @entity84 marathon winner -- alleges she paid the @entity85 hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover up " abnormal blood values " and as a bribe to compete in the @entity88			2
" it all started at the end of 2011 , in december , " @entity81 tells the program on camera , according to the transcript sent to @entity92			2
" the @entity85 approached us			0
they told us that we could have problems -- that participating at the @entity96 was endangered			0
" and now we would have to pay 150,000 euros to solve these problems			0
then i could take part in the @entity100			0
i have dedicated my whole life to preparing for the @entity100			0
" by the next summer , @entity102 says she paid a total of 450,000 euros in bribes , according to the documentary			2
earlier this year the @entity85 handed @entity81 a two - year ban after her biological passport -- a method used to monitor any potential doping violations -- showed " abnormal haematological curves			0
" many of the claims made within the program come from @entity115 , a former official at @entity61 and his wife , @entity116 , a former runner who was banned for doping			1
@entity118 worked for @entity61 between 2008 and 2011 , but he and his wife have now left @entity3 , according to the documentary			1
" in a training camp in @entity126 , our athletes simply lived under false names , " @entity116 told the documentary , according to the transcript @entity92 has been given			2
" they have taken banned substances , they undertook a course of doping , and to ensure that foreign control officers did not come and test them , they provided false names			0
" when we were in @entity135 in a training camp , i was supposed to start a course of tablets on 15 november			0
a coach asked me , ' have you got clean urine ? ' i said to him : ' no , you should have told me about that before			0
' " then he said : ' fill some in here in advance , so that you have some if the control officers come here			0
' i then did what he had said and i had a container in the freezer with clean urine			0
however @entity151 , the director of @entity153 's doping control lab , told investigative journalist @entity154 , who worked on the documentary : " you should be very careful to believe cheaters			1
because they have the catastrophe of their life			0
" the @entity3 government funds and oversees the @entity85 , @entity61 and the national doping test laboratory			1
the @entity164 told @entity92 that it is now awaiting a report from the @entity49			1
" these are very serious allegations and the @entity164 will not hesitate to take all necessary steps , " an @entity164 spokeswoman told @entity92 in a statement			1
" the @entity170 has already been in contact with @entity49 independent @entity170 which has begun an investigation			0
the @entity173 has asked to be kept fully informed of any issues that could fall under its jurisdiction and for which future action may be necessary			0
" according to the latest @entity49 report , @entity3 currently has 68 athletes banned for doping offenses			1
in a statement on its website , the @entity49 revealed that its ethics commission would be examining the allegations			0
" the @entity49 has noted a number of grave allegations regarding doping activities related to the sport of athletics in @entity3 , which have been broadcast on the @entity5 tv channel @entity10 / @entity9 on 3 december 2014 , " read the statement			1
" an investigation by the @entity194 is already ongoing with respect to some of the allegations made in the documentary			2
" we would like to underline that the @entity194 is completely independent of the @entity49 and has full powers to investigate and issue sanctions when relevant			0
" a transcript in @entity21 of the @entity5 tv documentary has been forwarded to the @entity170			1
" with regard to matters revealed in the documentary related to anti-doping and , therefore outside the scope of the @entity170 , these will be studied carefully and dealt with according to the relevant @entity49 rules and in full co-operation with @entity6			1
