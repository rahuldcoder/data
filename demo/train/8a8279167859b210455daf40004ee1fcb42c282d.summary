editor 's note : @entity2 is the founder and principal of the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , and author of " @entity8 : nobody is coming to @entity10 , " which offers solutions to problems in the black community			1
@entity2 says a question from a parent started his journey to creating a top - performing school			1
@entity5 , @entity6 ( @entity20 ) -- " why do only rich kids get good schools ? " i was the founder and director of a part - time out - of - school college preparatory program			1
the questioner was a parent ; herself a victim of a dulled urban education			1
the statement was more of an indictment than question , and i had no answer			1
" well , why ca n't this program be a school , " she offered			1
the program sent 100 percent of our graduates to college			1
we served poor students who were the first generation in their families to attend college			1
we provided college preparation through a six - week summer program , after - school tutoring and in - school academic advising			1
that single mother 's question came at the end of the summer program			1
this was always a tough time			0
as the kids said goodbye to their friends and the program 's high expectations , we all looked at the school year with great trepidation			1
we knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match			1
like that mom , i too wondered why wealth and whiteness are too often linked to quality education			1
her question connected to a discussion that i 'd been having with some colleagues during the summer program			1
all of the teachers in that program worked in failed urban schools			1
many had tried to reform traditional urban schools			1
they 'd started formal and informal programs , identified groups of kids and connected to parents			1
each had had some success with some kids , but the conditions that led to the need to do something went unchanged			1
the question was raised at the end of our 2002 summer program			1
my first instinct was to begin down the path of opening an all - male minority charter school			2
in @entity6 , charter schools are publicly funded and privately run , with no teachers ' unions , no school board influence and no centralized curriculum			1
there was only one minus : there was no money			0
the charter idea was dead as soon as it began			0
i assembled an all - black team			2
my plan was to put black educators together , and we would show ' em. brothers and sisters were gon na open a successful charter school			2
black educators serving black kids			2
this was my first major mistake			0
talent and commitment have no color			0
kids do n't care what color their teachers are , and i should n't have either			2
after almost a year of stops and starts with a team that was not effectively assembled , i realized that i failed in my judgment because i did not keep my eye on the goal , which was to build a school that sent kids to college regardless of their hue or economic status			1
i have never made that mistake again			0
i doubled back and went into the schools and found the teachers who stayed the latest and arrived the earliest			2
i looked for the most ambitious teachers who had a reputation of being the most talented , and we started a second team			1
i am a social worker			0
i knew that i could run an organization , but was n't sure about developing curriculum			0
when i created @entity139 2 , my first pick was the best teacher i could find			0
@entity141 is the perfect complement , or opposite , of who i am			0
he 's meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum			0
he is an operations genius			0
he was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach			0
i 've never been an assistant and do n't want to be one			0
our team was composed of a white guy , a @entity151 , a black woman and a black man bound by a single commitment : to send kids to college			1
in 2003 - 04 , @entity6 was settling a desegregation case			0
a component of the agreement was to open eight magnet schools in @entity5 in two years			2
magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme - based schools , complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board			1
the part - time college preparatory program was hosted in a community college			2
the college 's president was an impulsive visionary			2
on a friday afternoon elevator ride from the 10th to the seventh floor , he said , " @entity2 , we 're gon na start a high school , you should run it			1
" i told him i would and got off on the seventh floor			0
first thing that following monday , i was in his office with the dead charter school application			2
over the next few months , we tweaked it until it became a magnet application			0
with the help of some of the program 's parents , we submitted it to @entity5 's mayor , superintendent , and then the board			0
the process was anything but smooth			2
the district could not conceptualize what @entity192 would become			0
a year - round college - preparatory uniform school for grades six to 12 was the absolute antithesis of the district 's offerings			1
@entity5 was either the worst or second - worst school system in @entity6 , with a high dropout rate and three failed traditional high schools			1
at first , @entity192 was a poorly received idea			0
it became real , in large part , because of the state 's settlement and our team 's determination to answer the question			1
after receiving school board and state approval in december 2004 , we were expected to open for august 2005			2
the problem was that while we had a " team , " @entity192 did n't have a single employee			2
since we were becoming @entity217 employees , we all had to apply for our jobs			0
my hire was relatively painless			0
@entity141 , the team 's operations genius , was turned away as an " internal " candidate			2
after two years of working 30 hours a week to turn an idea into a reality , he became our first central office / union casualty			2
i promised to resign if he was n't hired			0
finally , the district relented and gave him the job that he had designed			0
this was to become an ongoing theme in the school 's first few years : ridiculous actions focused on maintaining the failed status quo			2
we worked through the summer with the rest of the team			2
the district stumbled and stalled until , with less than two weeks before our first day of school , @entity192 only had two staff members : @entity141 and me			0
we were not allowed to hire a single teacher			0
even though we had had a team that had worked for years researching and designing the school for no money , we were told that none of them could be hired because union rules dictated who and when we could hire			1
this meant that our last employee for year one was hired 14 hours before the first day of school			0
in the years that have followed , the struggles with the union and central office 's narrow , regressive policies have tested our commitment to answer that mother 's simple question			1
the complexity of the answer is rooted in @entity192 's relationship to the failed policies of the once highly centralized district and educators ' union			1
in recent years , a new superintendent has come on board -- the third in our first three years			0
his approach has been absolutely aligned with what we need to exist			0
he leaves us alone as long as we get results			0
he ca n't shield us from the unions , but he has supported our creativity and commitment to our kids			0
he lets me run the school , and our teachers teach what works			0
that 's all we 've ever sought			0
answering the question of " why only the rich kids get good schools " has set our team on an odyssey			1
seven years later , we have an answer that we are proud of			0
rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools , because @entity192 's 80 percent black / @entity151 , 60 percent poor students attend one of @entity292 's top high schools , according to @entity293			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : a parent asked why only rich kids get good schools
he says question started process of building a quality school
@entity2 says his team fought *bureaucracy* , union to try something new
he says his school is highly rated and sends all graduates to college
