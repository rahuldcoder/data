@entity0 -- former @entity4 rep. @entity3 's semen was found on underwear belonging to @entity6 , according to an @entity8 biologist testifying wednesday in the trial of @entity10 , who is accused of murdering the @entity0 intern in 2001			1
the panties were retrieved in may 2001 by investigators searching @entity6 's apartment in the days after her parents reported her missing			1
her body was found over a year later in @entity0 's @entity19			0
the testimony addresses the question of whether @entity3 , a sitting congressman from @entity22 at the time @entity6 vanished , was having an affair with the intern , who had just turned 24 when she disappeared			1
the biologist , @entity25 , testified for prosecutors that no dna was recovered from a separate pair of underwear and sports tights recovered from the crime scene			0
regarding lab tests of the underwear recovered from @entity6 's apartment , @entity25 said that " the sperm dna profile was compared to and matched to @entity3			1
" @entity3 , who testified in the trial on november 1 , has refused to address the question of whether he had sex with @entity6			1
" we 've lost our feeling for common decency , " @entity3 told prosecutor @entity38 when she asked in court if the two had been intimate			0
" i did n't commit any crime			0
i did n't do anything wrong			0
" the disappearance of @entity6 , then an intern for the federal @entity46 , drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with @entity3			2
the congressman was never a suspect in the case , but was questioned intensively for details as to @entity6 's whereabouts			1
prosecutors believe @entity10 , a reputed member of the @entity56 gang @entity55 , attacked @entity6 while she was jogging and then killed her when she began to scream			1
@entity10 denies that he attacked @entity6			2
there has been no physical evidence linking him to the assault , leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on @entity10 's alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern			2
partly as a result , prosecutors on wednesday asked the trial judge to drop two of the six counts against @entity10 , including a count of first degree sexual assault			0
he is still , however , facing first degree murder , kidnapping , and robbery charges			0
the judge rejected a defense motion to acquit @entity10 on the remaining counts .			0
