@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 sleeps with a t - shirt tucked in her pillowcase			2
it carries the scent of her father 's cologne while he 's on patrol in @entity12			1
her younger sister , @entity13 , sleeps with her @entity15 -- a stuffed soldier that displays a photo of her father across its face			2
at 14 and 10 , the two girls try to maintain normalcy			2
they 're active in school , they help with dinner , they rally around their mother			2
and they show no mercy for @entity28 over the @entity29 he earned by saving several comrades whose armored humvee was shredded by a roadside bomb			2
they tease him about a photo of the burned - out vehicle			2
" how did you take this picture ? were n't you supposed to go get them and help ? " @entity13 says			2
as much as the two laugh , in an instant , the giggles can turn into tears			2

while army sgt. 1st class @entity59 serves his third combat tour , the lives of his two young girls -- like the tens of thousands of other children with a parent deployed overseas -- are being changed and shaped by a war that is already the longest in @entity63 history			1
for them , at tender ages , the war is personal			2
heading to ' @entity67 ' four weeks earlier , the girls escorted their father across @entity0 to say goodbye			2

after tearful goodbyes , the soldiers headed to a gym			2
in their hands , they carried soldier readiness packets detailing their medical history , their dental records -- and their wills			2
the men represent the epitome of the @entity63 soldier -- hulking guys of all races with closely cropped hair , square jaws , and arms the size of pythons			2
they have an intensity on their faces , steeped in thought , many having to transition from fathers to warriors in an instant			2
by week 's end , they will arrive in @entity12 , ready to battle members of @entity148 and @entity150 fighters after an exhaustive series of flights with stops in @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 along the way			1
before shipping out , the soldiers gathered around lt. col. @entity159			2

" do you want these potatoes in a bowl ? " she asks her mother			0
@entity3 does n't ask her dad about details from the war zone			1
