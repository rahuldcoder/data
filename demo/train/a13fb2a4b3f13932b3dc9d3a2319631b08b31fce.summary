@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was two weeks after d - day , a few miles from the bloody shores of @entity6			2
an airstrip had been carved out of the @entity9 countryside , costing the lives of 28 @entity12 engineers at the hands of @entity15 snipers			1
a lone sniper still remained in the nighttime distance			2
despite the risk , capt. @entity18 felt compelled to play his trumpet			1
that afternoon , his p - 47 fighter group had caught up with a retreating @entity15 @entity22			1
as the @entity24 descended on their targets , they saw @entity27 women and children on top of the tanks			2
after an initial fly - by , the order was given to attack anyway			2
" we were told those human shields were expendable , " @entity18 said			1
back at the airstrip , @entity18 took out his trumpet			1
he 'd used it on many a starlit night to entertain the men of the 508th @entity38			0
" i was told , ' captain , do n't play tonight ; your trumpet makes the most glorious sound , ' but i was stressed , " he said			1
he was so troubled that he was willing to take a chance the sniper would n't fire			2
" i thought to myself , that @entity15 sniper is as lonely and scared as i am			1
how can i stop him from firing ? so i played that @entity15 's love song , ' @entity48 , ' made famous in the late ' 30s by @entity49 , the famous @entity15 actress			1
and i wailed that trumpet over those apple orchards of @entity9 , and he did n't fire			2
" the next morning , the military police came up to @entity18 and told him they had a @entity15 prisoner on the beach who kept asking , " who played that trumpet last night ? " " i grabbed my trumpet and went down to the beach			1
there was a 19 - year - old @entity15 , scared and lonesome			1
he was dressed like a @entity27 peasant to cloak his role as a sniper			2
and , crying , he said , ' i could n't fire because i thought of my fianc√©			0
i thought of my mother and father , ' and he says , ' my role is finished			0
' " he stuck out his hand , and i shook the hand of the enemy , " @entity18 said			1
" [ but ] he was no enemy , because music had soothed the savage beast			0
" " boy , you have strong lips " @entity18 had learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in @entity79			1
his mother , a nurse , died at 29 , and his father , a bartender and alcoholic , left the next day -- leaving @entity18 and his brother , @entity83 , orphans			1
they left their home in @entity87 to live with an aunt in nearby @entity89			0
she gave @entity18 his first trumpet , and he quickly discovered he had a musical ear			1
" in 1939 , i was playing in @entity93 in a dance band of 22 musicians at @entity96			2
the famous trumpet player @entity97 came up to the band during intermission and said , ' you sound pretty good for white cats , ' " @entity18 recalled			1
he asked @entity97 what advice he would give a young trumpet player			1
" he said , ' always play the melody , man			1
look at them , see their age group , play their love songs , and you 'll carry all the money to the bank			2
' " @entity18 enrolled at @entity114 , where he met his future wife and fellow trumpeter , @entity117			1
" this beautiful brown - haired gal with luscious lips said , ' did you play the trumpet solo at the freshman assembly ? ' and i said , ' yes , ma'am , i did			1
' she said , ' boy , you have strong lips			0
' being a sophomore , i said , ' would you like to try me ? ' she nodded , and i went over and kissed her			0
" in 1941 , as war clouds gathered , @entity18 enlisted in the @entity12 and was sent to fighter school because he was an " individualist , " he said			1
" i wanted to fly it , fire it , navigate it , shoot the guns			0
" he once flew his plane through a dirigible hangar at @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137			0
the commandant was fuming mad			0
" he stood me in a brace , then he kind of smiled and says , ' we do n't want to quell spirit like that ... but do n't do it again ! ' " when d - day arrived on june 6 , 1944 , @entity18 was in the air , flying five missions			1
" i witnessed the invasion from a ringside seat			0
we saw 2 million men , 10,000 ships			0
and we just shot at everything , " he said			0
" we tried to help those men trying to get off the landing craft at high tide , where a lot of them were drowned			0
" i remember feeling pride and sadness as i saw the bodies of 4,000 killed in two hours			0
" @entity18 credits common sense and his first flight instructor , a crop duster , with his survival that day -- and the rest of the war			1
" i learned to love low - level flying			2
i never came off enemy targets high			0
i 'd lay it down a row of trees 400 knots , a foot off the ground , so all the flak would go over my head			0
they 'd wonder where i 'd gone			0
" trumpet in the cockpit @entity18 managed to fly 140 missions without taking a single bullet hole to his airplane -- the name of his infant daughter , @entity184 , painted on the side			1
" everyone wanted to fly it ; they thought it let a charmed life			0
" and on each mission , @entity18 carried his trumpet in the cockpit			1
" i took it in a little canvas bag attached to my parachute			0
i figured if i ever got shot down , it would go with me , and if i survived and got put into a prisoner of war camp , i could get an extra bar of soap from the guard			0
" his tour of duty ended just before his fighter group left for @entity204 and the @entity205			0
three months later , his plane was shot down and destroyed			0
@entity18 went on to fight in the @entity209 and @entity210 wars , and served in the @entity211 during the @entity212 and the @entity213			1
he retired in 1966 as a colonel , having earned the @entity215 , almost two dozen air medals and two @entity217 , the nation 's highest peacetime award			0
now 89 , @entity18 takes care of @entity117 , his wife of 68 years , who has alzheimer 's disease			1
as @entity223 approaches , he has a word of advice to veterans : " when you become a veteran , it 's my opinion that you should do everything to make people realize the wonderful life that you really have			0
" he still has his trumpet of 70 years and still performs at schools , family get - togethers and church functions			2
he has a stereo system installed in the back of his family van , where he inserts a cd of big band music and begins playing the melodies of a bygone era			2
" i was an unruly child , " he said			2
... my ambition as the last action on my part as a veteran is to hit high c and fall right into the grave			0
what a way to go ! "			0
