-- count @entity1 is being an awfully good sport			2
he 's opened his home to tourists , guided them through its grand halls and pointed out the exquisite frescoes , the work of 18th - century @entity10 painter @entity9			1
his visitors , in turn , are forcing him to pose in an antique clerical hat			1
the relic is one of many possessions on display in the villa			1
@entity1 smiles amicably as his guests snap away			2
sequins , silk and lace earlier , the count gave me , and a group of 20 like - minded travelers , a tour of his estate -- @entity28 ( @entity29 13 , @entity30 , @entity31 , +39 049 9350340 ; apartment rental : $ 5,427 a week ; tours from $ 7 )			1
the space seems entirely too grand to simply house the count and his son , @entity36			0
the ballroom is plastered with 18th - century frescoes painted by the one of the most famous @entity31 artists of that century , @entity41			1
mirrors are framed with eerily placid faces made from stucco			0
@entity1 and his son live in the villa , constructed by their ancestors in the 1500s			1
but in many ways it resembles a museum of bygone riches instead of an actual home			0
one room features mannequins clad in sequinned , silk and lace gowns that once belonged to the matrons of the @entity61			0
relics from another era -- including antique century hair pins and opera glasses -- speckle the home			1
visitors can explore the surrounding 18th century park and garden ; more than 968,000 - square - feet of land presided over by an array of statues			1
if that 's not grand enough , you can rent a grand , 3,860 - square - foot , four - bedroom apartment located in one of the villa 's wings			1
those who really want a taste of the aristocratic lifestyle can book private meals with the @entity84 , avail themselves of the cook , or pluck fresh produce from the garden and make their own meal in the private kitchen			0
and the counts are not only are they willing to wear funny hats , they 'll also help arrange travel bookings around the @entity10 countryside			1
cash - strapped counts so why is the @entity84 , with a noble history that dates back 2,000 years to the @entity97 , turning their 400 - year old estate into a glorified @entity99 ? the answer is simple : money			1
" we 're not wealthy enough to live in this place as a home , " admits @entity102			0
" we need this activity to maintain it			0
because of our visitors , we 're able to do restorations year by year			1
" @entity109 is one of nearly 150 villas in @entity31 's @entity111 -- which includes @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 -- to have opened their doors to paying guests			1
last year , the group joined forces in a tourist - led cooperative called @entity121			0
the initiative was founded by count @entity123 , a distinguished aristocrat with a well - trimmed white beard			0
i met @entity123 at his home in @entity127 , the 16th century @entity128 ( 31030 @entity129 , @entity127 , @entity31 , +39 0422 39 77 90 ; tours from $ 7 , advanced booking required )			1
clad in a dapper smoking jacket and custom - made loafers , he resembled a rather posh @entity134 , especially as he was brandishing a jar of homemade quince jelly -- the ingredients sourced from his 3.2 million square feet landscaped garden			0
he is n't the sort of man you 'd imagine renting out his rooms to tourists or selling a place at his dinner table for a paltry â ‚ ¬ 30 ( $ 40 ) a head			1
after all , he too heads up one of @entity31 's most respected clans -- one which recently celebrated its 1,000 - year anniversary and whose family tree can be glimpsed painted on a wall inside the villa			1
" our money is finished , " he admits , referring not just to himself but to the @entity111 's many landed gentry			1
aristocratic barista i ask @entity160 -- the owner of the 17th - century @entity162 ( @entity163 8 , @entity115 , @entity31 , +39 0444 321 803 ; apartment rental from $ 678 per week ; tours from $ 7 ) -- what would happen if she did n't open her home to lodgers and tours			1
she admits it 'd be a predicament			0
" these houses are so expensive to maintain			0
i actually know a friend that wants to sell it and she ca n't , " she says			0
" they 're very expensive and big and old -- people do n't want to buy them because they do n't know what to do with them , " she says			0
@entity102 admits that if he did n't inherit his stately home , it would n't be something he 'd invest in			0
" i would n't buy a place like this nowadays because it 's enormous , " he says			2
" the spaces are really grand , and we 're just two people living in 9,000 square feet			0
in that way , it 's a strange life , but it is also a unique kind of life			2
" a few years ago , the countess decided to add a cafe and bar to the heritage status property and even took a degree course to qualify as a barista			2
for the most part , she seems nonplussed about opening her historic home , which is adorned with baroque frescoes by celebrated father and son duo @entity205 and @entity204			0
" we have two apartments that we sometimes rent out to guests , but it 's not like we 're desperate to rent them ; we like to do it			1
we have nice people that come to stay , people that are into art and love to be here			0
" taxing times so why are members of @entity31 's aristocracy struggling to afford the upkeep of their grand homes ? the counts have a number of theories			1
@entity223 says his family 's woes started after the @entity226 , when nationalization stripped their land assets from 4,000 to 600 acres to support reconstruction and demobbed soldiers			2
" things changed , principles changed , " he says			0
" now the aristocracy is just part of a big machine and every one of us needs to have a job to have a normal life			0
" @entity239 says a 2012 end to tax breaks for heritage homes also had a dramatic effect			1
" our taxes have gone up six-fold , " she laments			0
" though we do get rent , it all goes back into the house			2
" to ensure their preservation , the countess has to climate control the rooms in her house and complete constant repairs such as fixing a recent ceiling crack			2
" the roof was n't holding the four main doors properly , " she recalls			2
damage can endanger the frescoes , which already expensive to maintain			0
@entity123 had a similar issue with a roof collapse at his villa			2
he insists the money he makes from visitors is not lining his pocket , but goes solely into the upkeep of his estate , which , he points out , is n't merely his home , but an @entity31 landmark			1
" i 'm trying to protect this house , and the richness of our history , our roots , but it 's expensive , " he says .			2

hard times are forcing @entity31 's counts and countesses to throw open their doors to tourists
sixteenth century @entity28 villa among many now *offering* rooms to rent
@entity31 's aristocrats say cash from visitors will help preserve their homes and @entity31 's heritage
