-- should young children be able to use @entity2 ? and if so , under what conditions ? those are the questions bloggers and @entity6 users are batting around the internet on monday following a news report saying @entity2 is looking into ways it could let kids under the age of 13 use the site with parental consent			1
currently , @entity2 bans children younger than 13			1
data from @entity16 and @entity17 , however , show that many kids use the site anyway , often with their parents ' knowledge			1
a 2011 @entity17 survey found 7.5 million people younger than 13 use the site ; nearly a third of 11 - year - olds and more than half of 12 - year - olds use @entity2 with their parents ' knowledge , according to a 1,007 - person survey supported by @entity16			1
proponents of lifting @entity2 's under - 13 ban say letting young kids on @entity2 with the help of adults would allow them to use the social network more safely			1
" whether we like it or not , millions of children are using @entity2 , and since there does n't seem to be a universally effective way to get them off the service , the best and safest strategy would be to provide younger children with a safe , secure and private experience that allows them to interact with verified friends and family members without having to lie about their age , " @entity37 writes at @entity38			2
@entity37 says @entity2 for kids should not have ads and there need to be " extra privacy protections " that would involve parents helping their kids to use the social network safely			2
others say @entity2 is trying to profit from the under - 13 crowd			0
@entity61 , an advocacy group , compared @entity2 to " @entity62			0
" poll : should kids younger than 13 be allowed to use @entity2 ? " with the growing concerns and pressure around @entity2 's business model , the company appears to be doing whatever it takes to identify new revenue streams and short - term corporate profits to impress spooked shareholders , " the group 's ceo , @entity65 , said in a statement			1
" but here 's the most important issue : there is absolutely no proof of any meaningful social or educational value of @entity2 for children under 13			0
indeed , there are very legitimate concerns about privacy as well as the impact on the social , emotional and cognitive development of children			0
what @entity2 is proposing is similar to the strategies used by @entity62 in appealing to young people -- try to hook kids early , build your brand , and you have a customer for life			2
" what 's next ? facebook for toddlers ? " the @entity99 on monday published a front - page report saying @entity2 is looking into ways to give younger children access to the social - networking site , which has more than 900 million users around the world and which made its lackluster stock market debut last month			1
" mechanisms being tested include connecting children 's accounts to their parents ' and controls that would allow parents to decide whom their kids can ' friend ' and what applications they can use , " the newspaper said , citing anonymous sources who are familiar with the dealings			0
" the under - 13 features could enable @entity2 and its partners to charge parents for games and other entertainment accessed by their children , the people said			2
" in a statement issued to @entity0 and other news outlets , @entity2 did not deny looking into the issue but said it does not have anything formal to announce : " many recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to enforce age restrictions on the @entity134 , especially when parents want their children to access online content and services			0
we are in continuous dialogue with stakeholders , regulators and other policymakers about how best to help parents keep their kids safe in an evolving online environment			0
