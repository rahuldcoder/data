but the rain did n't fall and june brought blistering heat			2
now , as punishing drought grips the @entity11 , @entity1 , 61 , walks his hard - hit 4,000 acres in southwest @entity4 in utter dismay			1
where there should have been tall , dark green , leafy plants , there now stand corn stalks that are waist high or , at best , chest high			1
they are pale in color and spindly			2
pull back an ear 's husk and you find no kernels , he says			2
with temperatures rising above 95 degrees , the pollen starts to die			1
" it 's emotionally draining , " he said			2
" the crop got out of the ground very well			2
but maybe a few of us were counting our eggs before they were hatched			2
" the costs of @entity37 's worst drought in 24 years is obvious to @entity1 , who has been farming for four decades			1
they are not so apparent to @entity37 consumers -- at least , not yet			0
but down the line , people are certain to be paying more for food this year			0

the parched conditions come after some areas of the @entity37 suffered record - setting heat waves , killer storms and blazing wildfires			1
in @entity37 's @entity74 , the prognosis for farmers is grim as fields and pastures become drier by the day			1
@entity1 says the drought is already larger in scope than in 1988 , and he fears it will intensify to become worse			1
many areas in the southern @entity11 are reporting the poorest conditions for june since 1988			0
corn prices pop after lower production forecast " in the hottest areas last week , which were generally dry , crop conditions deteriorated quickly , " writes @entity83 , author of the @entity66			1
he says 30 % of the corn crop in the 18 primary corn - growing states is now in poor or very poor condition , up from 22 % the previous week			1
half of @entity37 's pastures and ranges are in poor or very poor condition , up from 28 % in mid-june , he says			2
think it 's hot ? imagine living here the sizzling conditions have also led to a dramatic increase in wildfire activity since mid-june , shortly after the @entity98 ignited near @entity99 , @entity100			0
during the past three weeks , acres scorched by wildfires went up from 1.1 million to 3.1 million			0

" i 'm about 50 percent short of needed moisture , " he said			0
" in parts of southern @entity4 , southern @entity137 , they have been much drier for a longer period			1
we looked good , compared to them			0
" at this stage , @entity128 needs 2 inches of rain right away to carry his corn crop as well as his soybeans , which will start aborting pods without adequate moisture			1
it will be challenging for many farmers , who often pay $ 800 to $ 1,000 per acre to plant a crop			2
consumers will be hurting as well down the line when they feel the drought in their pocketbooks , says @entity128 , who is also the director of research and commodity services at the @entity156			2
corn prices have climbed 45 % already , @entity128 says ; soybeans , 22 %			1

in fact , he said , meat prices could fall at first if farmers slaughter more animals to decrease the cost of buying feed			2

@entity1 , the @entity4 farmer , says he must wait now until the fall of 2013 before he can hope for a full harvest			1
@entity188 weather affects everyone , but farmers are especially at the whim of @entity192 , he says			2
