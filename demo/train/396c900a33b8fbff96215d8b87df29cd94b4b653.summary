-- when you think of potentially fatal threats at the beach , you probably think of sharks or riptides			1
you probably do n't worry about the sand			1
but that unexpected killer has now claimed at least three lives in the @entity9 this summer			1
nine - year - old @entity11 died at a @entity13 , @entity14 , beach on friday , when a hole she was digging in the sand caved in and buried her , authorities said			1
" we heard screaming , " @entity17 , who was staying at a nearby hotel , told @entity0 affiliate @entity19			1
" at first we thought , you know , it was just kids			0
but it was like screaming and screaming and screaming			1
" " her and her siblings were digging a big hole in the sand , " @entity13 police sgt. @entity26 said			1
" she was sitting inside , and the hole collapsed			0
we believe she was under the sand around five minutes			1
" @entity36 , her family and friends were visiting the beach from @entity38 , @entity14			1
police and firefighters dug her out			0
she was unconscious and not breathing			0
emergency crews performed cpr on her and transported her to a hospital , where she was declared dead			0
mourners left flowers , candles and notes near where she died			1
before the emergency workers arrived , beachgoers had frantically tried to dig her out , but the sand kept collapsing back into the hole , @entity26 said			2
that 's a common problem when someone gets buried at the beach , @entity55 of the @entity56 said sunday			1
" once the sand starts collapsing , digging out becomes a technical rescue , " @entity60 said			2
" it 's difficult because the sand keeps collapsing back into the hole , and the more people gathering around , the more difficult it is			2
" " it 's not unusual for kids to build holes and sandcastles in the sand , but a lot of people do n't understand it can collapse , " @entity26 said			2
" it 's difficult for people to understand how hard it is to get people out			0
" dry sand weighs 100 pounds per square foot , and wet sand weighs 120 pounds per square foot , according to a 2004 study from the @entity83 , entitled " @entity84 in @entity85 : a @entity86			2
" " dry sand burial can totally engulf and compress a person ... with no air pocket for breathing , " the report said			1
" depending on the age and strength of the child , just 1 foot of sand may overwhelm respiratory and diaphragmatic force , " but according to the @entity99 study , airway obstruction is an even bigger concern than sand stifling lung and diaphragm expansion			2
" although accidental sand burial has its own set of clinical problems , clearing the airway is the main focus of treatment			2
airway management at the scene of the incident may be crucial and lifesaving , " the @entity99 report said			0
the hole containing @entity36 was big enough for a crouching adult to fit in , witnesses told @entity19			1
@entity60 said no national standards exist to restrict the depth of holes , though local jurisdictions often set their own rules			0
for example , in @entity124 , @entity125 , the @entity56 's home base , beach visitors are n't supposed to dig holes deeper than knee - level , even for small children , @entity60 said			2
there 's also no national database of fatal sand collapses , @entity60 said			2
they do n't happen often , @entity60 said , " but often enough that we try to make people aware			0
" articles in scholarly journals over the past decade , including the @entity99 report , have called for public health and safety officials to be more aware of sand dangers			0
in june 2007 , the @entity139 published a letter to the editor entitled " @entity142 from @entity143 , " from dr. @entity144 of @entity145			0
@entity144 counted " 52 documented fatal and nonfatal cases , occurring primarily in the past 10 years , in which persons were submerged after the collapse of a dry - sand hole excavated for recreational purposes			0
" he said 31 of those 52 people died , and " the other 21 survived by virtue of timely rescue involving extrication from the sand ; many of them required cardiopulmonary resuscitation , performed by a bystander			1
" @entity144 's study concluded that collapses were inadvertently triggered by a variety of circumstances , including digging , tunneling , jumping , or falling into the hole			0
@entity168 children like @entity169 are n't the only age group at risk			0
the two sand - related fatalities earlier this summer were both grown men			1
a 49 - year - old @entity125 man died on the beach at @entity177 's @entity176 on june 23 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity178			1
@entity179 of @entity180 , @entity125 , had to be extracted from a hole approximately 5 to 6 feet deep			0
a bystander was unable to revive him			0
and on july 21 , in @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity184 was buried alive while tunneling under the sand , @entity0 affiliate @entity183 reported			1
fire officials said @entity184 was standing in a 10 - foot - deep pit when the sand rushed in around him			0
@entity0 's @entity192 contributed to this report			0

@entity11 , 9 , died friday , buried in sand at an @entity14 beach
" we heard screaming , " a witness says
@entity36 is at least the third person to die in beach sand in the @entity9 this summer
