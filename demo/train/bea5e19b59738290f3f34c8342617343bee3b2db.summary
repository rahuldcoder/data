-- women have been badly let down by the men they stood with during demonstrations that toppled tyrants in the @entity5 and @entity6			1
shot at , tortured , assaulted and detained -- they were equals at the point of protest but now , as new governments extend their grip , we can see that , as citizens , women remain firmly in the second class			1
so , as we celebrate the role of women on @entity18 , let us not forget that the struggle for equality is far from won			1
even when progress seems to be a given , the pendulum can swing back leaving fresh challenges to defend progressive values			0
in @entity27 , it did not matter that women had played a critical role in the uprisings that ousted the tyrant @entity31			2
it did not matter that they had suffered equally from repression and lack of economic opportunity along with the men			2
it did not matter that they were subjected to the additional burden of discrimination because they were female			0
it did not matter that the @entity44 tried to discredit women protestors by arresting them and subjecting them to forced virginity tests			2
when elections finally came after so many years of dictatorship , @entity47 asked political parties in @entity27 to make commitments to basic human rights principles : principles such as freedom of expression and assembly , religious freedom , non-discrimination and gender equality			1
most of those seeking political power through the parliamentary elections fell short of meeting even these minimum human rights commitments			0

the @entity72 , which came second with 121 seats ( 24 per cent ) declined to promote women 's rights or abolish the death penalty			2
so 71 % of the new parliament is unwilling to commit to promoting women 's rights and gender equality			1
there have been some chinks of light			0
@entity82 of @entity83 was named as one of three women @entity86 for peace , in an important , though , belated recognition of the role women have played in the protests dubbed the @entity92			1
during those heady days , women were a powerful voice , a compelling presence in the protests			0
they took the same risks as men when exposing human rights abuses committed by the state and calling for accountability ; as leaders and agents of change in the uprisings they have not been exempt from the worst of the violence			1
many women protesters were harassed , arrested , tortured and otherwise ill - treated in gender - specific ways just because they are women , defying convention and exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly			1
in @entity114 , where thousands of women took part in anti-government demonstrations , dozens were arrested and some were reportedly tortured or otherwise ill - treated			1
in @entity83 , women taking part in protests and women activists have been killed , harassed , arrested and in some cases beaten for their participation in protests			1
in a desperate attempt to sideline women , @entity83 officials demanded that male relatives assert control over the women in their family and stop their activism			0
read also : women prisoners find freedom behind bars however , women 's protest is not new in this region : women were demanding their human rights long before the start of the uprisings of the last year -- in @entity144 and elsewhere			1
in @entity147 , 20 years after women first sat at the wheels of their cars and challenged the restriction on females driving , the ban remains in place			0
any woman who dares to challenge the ban faces arrest and attacks on their character			0
@entity147 religious clerics have claimed that allowing women to drive would lead to moral decline in the kingdom			0
the demands of the women are clear			0
women want a seat at the table and a voice in the debate and a vote in the decision making			0
more specifically , women are calling for equal rights to political participation and decision - making , equal rights in law , including in relation to marriage , divorce , child custody and inheritance			2
women must have legal protection from gender - based violence , including domestic violence and marital rape , and sexual harassment			1
@entity18 is an opportunity to recognize the courage and stamina of the women living in the @entity5 and @entity6			0
they will not be pushed back to the kitchen			0
we must all take a stand today in solidarity with them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198			2

@entity198 says women took the same risks as men during the @entity92 .
however , women are treated as second - class citizens in *post-revolution* politics , says @entity198 .
using cases from the region , @entity198 argues that the struggle for gender equality is far from won .
