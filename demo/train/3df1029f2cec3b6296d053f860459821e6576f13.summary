@entity1 , @entity0 -- with irresponsible banking practices taking the blame for bringing about the global economic crisis , there has been a surge of interest in @entity10 finance			1
@entity10 finance is estimated to be worth $ 700 billion and has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year			2
now , a slew of academic courses are springing up to meet the demand of those wanting to break into an expanding market			2
according to ratings agency @entity17 , the global @entity10 finance sector is worth $ 700 billion and has the potential to be worth $ 4 trillion			2
what 's more , the ethical principles underpinning @entity10 finance are seen by some as offering a more sustainable alternative to profit - oriented conventional banking			1
the result is that academic institutions are lining up to offer formal training in the area			0
" there is a huge demand for @entity10 finance courses now , so large that it 's difficult to cope with , " professor @entity31 , @entity32 chair in the school of government and international affairs at @entity36 , @entity0 , told @entity2			1
@entity38 will launch a masters degree in @entity10 finance from october , becoming one of a number of @entity43 institutions to offer @entity10 finance programs			2
" @entity10 finance has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year for some time and there is a lot of interest at the moment			1
people are looking for alternatives after the economic crisis			0
" " @entity10 economists believe that if the principles of @entity10 finance were followed the crisis would n't have happened			1
we are seeing a lot of @entity59 countries , including the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 encouraging @entity10 finance , " he said			2
there are many differences between @entity10 and conventional banking practices			0
one fundamental difference is that @entity10 banks do not charge interest			1
rather than borrowers and lenders , the system is based on buyers and sellers			0
" conventional banking is biased to the seller			0
@entity10 finance is trying to level the ethics between the two parties , " @entity78 , an @entity10 finance scholar who writes for @entity79 , told @entity2			2
" people think the @entity10 system is based on faith , but it 's based on justice			0
the system is based on justice for the two parties and how you get to the justice is extracted from @entity10 faith , " he said			0
@entity78 said that there are similarities between " ethical investment " schemes and @entity10 finance , in that the @entity10 system does not allow investment that harms people or the environment			1
he credits the rapid growth of the @entity10 finance sector on the success of " sukuk " -- @entity10 bonds			2
in the @entity109 , banks including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 all offer @entity10 finance products , catering to a niche market of @entity113 borrowers			1
but while @entity10 banks allow @entity113 to take advantage of financial services that are consistent with their religious beliefs , it is the ethics underpinning @entity10 finance that are attracting the interest of conventional finance institutions keen to learn lessons from the banking crisis			1
although @entity10 banks have suffered from the global repercussions of the economic downturn , they emerged largely unscathed from the initial banking meltdown that brought about that financial turmoil			1
@entity31 told @entity2 that is because @entity10 banks are not allowed to deal in mortgage - backed securities or credit - default swaps , two of the practices accused of helping bring about the banking crisis			1
@entity78 said that although it 's too early to say if @entity10 finance has dealt with economic downturn better than conventional finance , the @entity10 system has many more layers of risk assessment and management , which could help protect it from the problems afflicting conventional banks			1
but the growth of @entity10 finance has brought its own problems			0
critics say some banks use @entity10 finance to package what are essentially conventional products			2
" @entity10 banks are also driven by the profit motive and sometimes that can dominate the ethics , " @entity31 told @entity2			0
while @entity43 is catching up with the demand for these banking products , the @entity149 is lagging behind			0
@entity31 says that regulatory and legal changes are needed for @entity10 finance to grow in the @entity149 , but he adds there are signs that @entity156 may become a @entity158 center for @entity10 finance			0
the lack of @entity10 finance services in the @entity149 is reflected in a relative lack of demand for @entity10 finance courses , but in the @entity60 there is the opposite problem			1
with students coming from @entity167 and the @entity168 to get the qualifications that will help them take advantage of the @entity10 finance boom , @entity31 says it is difficult for universities to find qualified teaching staff			0
" most people with phds in @entity10 finance are working in the industry , making a lot of money , " he told @entity2			0
he added that @entity10 finance products have the potential to appeal to the @entity59 market , pointing out that in @entity185 the majority of customers for @entity10 banks are n't @entity113			1
" if people look at the principles they 'll see something beneficial in terms of economics , rather than just religious reasons			0
it 's a type of ethical finance that may be attractive to a lot of people			0

there is an increase in demand for academic courses in @entity10 finance
some believe @entity10 finance principles would have *avoided* banking crisis
@entity10 banks do not charge interest or deal in mortgage - backed securities
some principles are similar to those used for ethical investments
