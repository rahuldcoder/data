-- @entity1 reached settlements over the past few months with what it calls 26 victims of former assistant football coach @entity5 -- settlements that will cost the university a total of $ 59.7 million , the school announced monday			1
of the 26 settlements , 23 are signed and three are agreed in principle , with final documentation expected within the next few weeks , the school said			2
the school also indicated a few other settlements still could come			0
" there was no happiness , " said @entity17 , the attorney for a man known as @entity19 from @entity5 's criminal trial			1
" for my client , there was relief			2
" @entity5 was convicted in june 2012 of 45 counts relating to the sexual abuse of young boys			1
he 's serving a 30 - to 60 - year prison sentence			0
he has always maintained his innocence and has plans to appeal , his attorney has said			0
in all , 32 men have come forward to @entity1 with claims of abuse			1
some of those were rejected for lack of merit , @entity1 said			1
" we hope this is another step forward in the healing process for those hurt by mr. @entity5 , and another step forward for @entity1 , " university president @entity39 said in a statement			1
" we can not undo what has been done , but we can and must do everything possible to learn from this and ensure it never happens again at @entity1			2
" as part of the agreement , this settlement ends the civil litigation for these 26 men			0
@entity17 said these victims will not be able to sue anyone else , including @entity5 's charity , @entity57 , where prosecutors say he selected most of his victims			1
however , @entity1 can go after the charity to recoup some of its losses , @entity17 said			2
although the criminal trial involved only 10 victims , more allegations surfaced in the months that followed @entity5 's november 2011 arrest			1
abuse as far back as the 1970s has been reported to authorities			0
@entity17 praised @entity1 lawyers in regard to the settlement process , saying they worked methodically through each claim , making it possible to settle in just about 13 months			2
not all the settlements are equal of amounts , @entity17 said , but were evaluated separately based on when the abuse allegedly happened			0
prosecutors have said that @entity1 officials -- former president @entity78 , former vice president @entity79 , and former athletic director @entity80 -- all knew about two allegations against @entity5 in 1998 and in 2001			1
the 1998 incident was investigated and dismissed by prosecutors at the time , but the 2001 incident was never reported to police by university officials			0
victim 5 was abused six months after that 2001 incident , and so his settlement and others who say they were abused after 2001 had more negotiating power , @entity17 said			0
@entity80 , @entity91 , and @entity78 are all facing trial this @entity93 on charges including perjury , conspiracy , obstruction , failure to report suspected abuse and endangering the welfare of children			0
they also maintain their innocence			0
the scandal has so far cost @entity1 tens of millions of dollars , including a $ 60 million @entity105 fine , and millions more in crisis management .			1
