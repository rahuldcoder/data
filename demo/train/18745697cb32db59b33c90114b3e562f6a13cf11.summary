@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 first saw the devastation in @entity5 while watching the 5 o'clock news with her father			1
seeing so many people in need after the january 12 earthquake , the determined girl from the @entity10 suburbs wanted to help			2
" when i saw those pictures , i realized those kids in @entity5 did n't have a future unless someone would help them , " said @entity3 , 14			1
" i knew i had to be that someone			2
" @entity3 , who is active in her school 's theater , says she got some inspiration from @entity22			1
" @entity24 builds houses in @entity26 , @entity23 adopts kids from other countries -- that selflessness inspires me			2
i wanted to give people hope like they do , " she said			2
her goal was to raise $ 90,000 by this week , which marks 90 days since the earthquake			2
but to do that , she had to act quickly			0
she immediately called her friends at her church youth group , who were eager to help			0
" we had ideas coming out in every direction , " she said			0
with @entity42 approaching , the group decided to bake heart - shaped cookies and sell them to make money for the quake survivors			0
they also settled on a name for their group : student @entity50 for @entity5			1
" i 'm not the best baker in the world , but we were determined , " @entity3 said			1
with the help of their church 's industrial - sized oven , the teens baked 2,000 cookies , selling them to people heading to and from the train stations in the @entity10 suburb of @entity0			0
" i 'm absolutely not a morning person , and it was freezing , but we knew our mission was urgent , " @entity3 said			1
the cookies were a huge hit			0
even people trying to stick to a diet would drop in their change			0
by the end of the first day , student @entity50 for @entity5 had made $ 3,200			1
they sold the remaining cookies at @entity3 's father 's office in downtown @entity10			1
there , a @entity79 delivery man decided to buy 10 bags of cookies			0
he told @entity3 he was from @entity5			1
his mother still lived there , running an orphanage that was badly damaged			0
" he gave me the biggest bear hug and told me how proud he was that i was helping , " @entity3 said			1
" that gave me an idea			0
" the group sent the donations from the cookie sales to the @entity92 and @entity93 for immediate relief			1
but if her kid - run organization wanted to continue , @entity3 thought , it should provide a way for kids in the @entity10 area to directly help the kids in @entity5			1
" i thought after we all saw what we did on tv , other kids in my area would want to help , " she said			0
" student @entity50 for @entity5 could give them the tools to do that			1
" so with her father 's help , @entity3 set up a @entity113 page and started calling local schools			1
they also partnered with @entity116 , based in @entity117 , @entity118 , to rebuild a school in @entity5			1
other fundraising ideas came pouring through the @entity113 page : a boy whose father ran a wristband factory donated " @entity50 " wristbands			1
@entity3 's high school , @entity126 , donated the proceeds from its @entity129 dance			1
another boy turned his 15th birthday party into a fundraiser			0
local merchants in @entity0 and @entity134 put out donations buckets , and so did many of @entity3 's teachers			1
and 12 local schools started their own efforts			2
one of those schools was @entity141 's			2
@entity141 , 12 , had also been affected by the images of suffering in @entity5			1
shortly after the quake , she had reached out to her friends at @entity145 , and they approached the school 's principal to ask if they could help			0
" these kids in @entity5 had lost everything			1
i thought , ' how are they going to succeed in life if they do n't have a school ? ' " @entity141 said			0
" we hear all the time at our own school that we should help others when they are in need -- i thought here 's our chance			0
" while sympathetic , the principal told them the school was already committed to several service projects			0
she was n't sure if there 'd be time			0
but a couple of days later , the principal got a call from @entity3 's father , who convinced her to help student @entity50 for @entity5			1
" i was so excited when the principal called to ask if i was still interested in helping raise money for @entity5 , " @entity141 said			1
@entity3 's father gave the @entity145 students t - shirts and wristbands , and @entity141 and her friends spent the next recess planning how to sell the donated items			2
they put posters up on every floor and used the morning announcements to ask students to help			0
the group kept a big heart poster in the main office to track their progress			0
they 'd color in a little more each time they 'd raise $ 500			0
when the heart was full , the principal let the whole school know with an announcement on the @entity191			0
on the school 's dress - down day , students wore their @entity50 for @entity5 t - shirts and wristbands			2
" it was so cool to see all those kids in the halls wearing our t - shirts , " @entity141 said			0
" i 'd never done anything like this before			0
" in the end , the 672 - student school generated more than $ 5,500			2
that amount was doubled when student @entity50 for @entity5 got a matching grant , which meant that @entity145 's effort was enough to build and furnish one classroom in @entity5			1
with the matching grant from the @entity213 , which was founded by @entity215 pitcher @entity214 and his wife , @entity216 , the group has raised more than $ 80,000 so far			0
@entity3 says she still hopes to reach her goal of $ 90,000 , and after that , she has no plans to stop there			2
" i want to rebuild as many schools as we can , " @entity3 said			1
" we 've had rival schools helping ; we 've had kids from the public schools and the catholic schools , kids who do n't normally talk to each other working together on this			2
" i think this has helped kids realize it feels good to be a part of something bigger than just you			0

@entity3 wanted to do more for @entity5 than send donations from a cookie sale
she used @entity113 , phone calls to organize " student hearts for @entity5 " to help rebuild schools
more than a dozen schools have *joined* the effort , raising tens of thousands of dollars
