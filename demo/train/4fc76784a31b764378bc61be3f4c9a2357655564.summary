-- when the january 12 earthquake hit @entity3 , i watched hour upon hour of coverage on @entity0			1
like everyone else in the world , i saw images that were among the most horrifying caused by a natural disaster in our time			1
i had never been to @entity3 at the time			1
like many , i have friends and even family members of @entity3 descent			1
but what occurred to me and most others were the questions : " how could this happen and be so destructive ? " " why the lack of infrastructure ? " " why the lack of preparation for disaster ? " no country could be totally prepared for that kind of disaster , but @entity3 and its people seemed to be particularly disadvantaged against @entity27 's might			1
click to find out more about @entity0 documentary " rescued " i immediately got on my computer and began doing research , reading about @entity3 's history			1
admittedly , my @entity33 history dates were a bit foggy , so i tried to give myself a brief refresher			1
in school , we learned very early on about the abolition of slavery and @entity40			2
but i was never taught that there was a small black nation in the @entity43 that had defeated @entity45 's army in 1803			1
that was the same year the @entity47 decided to sell their only other colony in the @entity50 : @entity51			2
had the slaves , led by @entity53 , not overthrown the @entity54 in @entity3 , would the @entity47 have sold @entity51 to the @entity33 ? the @entity55 instantly doubled our country 's size			1
now , i have spent my time in @entity51			2
but i never linked these two events			0
i am sure historians do , but does the average @entity33 know that the @entity3 revolution possibly played a large role in the @entity64 ? so , i ask myself , had @entity53 not lived , would @entity33 be the @entity33 it is today ? if his army and the slaves had not defeated the @entity47 , would the @entity47 have wanted to sell their only other colony , so close to @entity3 ? so , the earthquake made me begin to read about history and look at events a little more closely			1
i do not understand why a country so close to some of the richest economies in the world could be in this position			0
i am not a political person by nature			0
but it does make you wonder how politically and historically , @entity3 's own government and those of nearby countries have shown no accountability			1
that same day , i began to get calls from many organizations , people i do business with , friends asking for financial assistance and donations			0
i kept responding : " get back to me on what to do for the children			1
" " call me on what we can do with the schools			0
" " can someone find me someone dealing with the orphan situation ? " " are these kids going to be out on the streets being sold into @entity101 knows what ? " i continued to be overwhelmed with requests , and to be honest , was very concerned about people taking advantage , or looking for their " moment in the spotlight to look like a savior , " or that conversations seemed premature or were losing focus on the big picture			0
you could not be human and look at the images and hear the stories and not feel helpless and complete empathy for those who were suffering			1
amid the chaos of what was unfolding on television , i tried my best to put myself in the place of the people and children who were living this reality			1
what does it feel like to lose a family member , or many family members and friends all at one time ? parents ? children ? what does it feel like to be trapped inside a building that has fallen around you , in many cases for days , waiting for someone to find you and dig you out			2
what does it feel like to be hungry and without water for days at a time , not knowing if you will ever taste anything again ? now , months later : what does it feel like to be abandoned ? what does it feel like to have a leg amputated , no parents , and live in a tent outside an orphanage that you can not go inside ? i can only imagine			0
i can not walk in the shoes of those who lived it			0
i also realized that i know nothing about emergency response , foreign aid or medical care			0
what i do know is that i can be effective in keeping the light on a problem -- a problem that will not be solved for a long , long time			0
this is a country full of young children who will be permanently affected by this catastrophe			2
it is our responsibility to help @entity3 solve this problem , as long as it takes to do it			1
we must not only rebuild the country , its roads , its buildings and its government			0
we also have to rebuild its children			2
it is an emergency to get these children back in schools			2
it was already an emergency before january 12 , when a large percentage of children were not in school			2
it is an emergency to protect their human rights , it is an emergency to give them health services and prevent diseases that have long - term impact			2
we must treat these children like children			2
they need music and arts and sports			0
they need trained teachers who can educate and protect them during the school day			0
they need to have safe places to play			0
they need access to computer labs , technology and modern education tools			0
i decided this is what i would focus on			0
how could i lead in contributing for immediate needs -- but also for those that linger ? a bed to sleep in and a roof over their heads			0
our team traveled to @entity225 and @entity226 over the past few weeks , and we are returning again this month			0
we have joined in partnership with the @entity228 of @entity3			1
the team met with the most amazing woman , @entity230 , who has been serving the children in her homeland of @entity3 since 1981			1
@entity233 has led the foundation in developing a full spectrum of services for the growing number of children brought into her care			2
we will support her organization and work to support @entity244 les @entity243 , a nonprofit and nongovernmental @entity3 organization			1
our foundation @entity248 , along with @entity246 , will support the ongoing need to rebuild the infrastructure and buildings for @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 , which both serve @entity3 orphans in her care			1
@entity248 and i will also be working on a partnership with @entity259 and @entity260 in @entity3 to help provide infrastructure and quality education , teacher training and supplies the children need to succeed			1
so many people have already given so much			0
but this effort is just beginning			0
it has been four months since that horrible day			0
one - third of a year			0
thousands of children are sitting in tents each day , with nowhere to go and nothing to do			2
it is easy to forget about what is no longer on the front page or staring you down on your tv or computer			0
we get back to our normal lives			0
but remember , these children can not resume their normal lives			1
we must not forget that in order to rebuild @entity3 , we must rebuild its youth			1
we must not leave them behind			0
their lives can not end at the hands of an earthquake			2
let 's find the light in the storm , and build a future for the children			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity296 .			1

@entity296 saw images from @entity3 earthquake and asked " how could this happen ? "
@entity296 : he and others knew little about @entity3 and its slave revolution 's impact on @entity33
it 's essential for @entity3 's future to remember its children , make sure they thrive , @entity296 writes
