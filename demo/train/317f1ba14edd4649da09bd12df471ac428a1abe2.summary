-- some of my most memorable travels have been abroad			2
but i can forgo the passport , lack of @entity5 , wading through customs and calculating currency exchanges and still experience all my favorite international elements right here in one city : @entity11 , @entity12			1
with @entity11 around , there are few reasons to leave the continental @entity15 for a worldly experience			1
@entity11 has a wine region that , according to @entity18 , is reminiscent of the @entity19			1
the brewery scene proudly earns the title " beer capital of the world " and the nickname " @entity23 on the @entity26			0
" and if you 're in the mood to travel to the @entity30 , there 's the @entity31 , an authentically built @entity33 - style garden			1
for the more domestically minded , there is terrific , tax - free shopping in the @entity36 and along @entity37			0
the @entity36 is known for cutting - edge art galleries , designer boutiques and @entity40 , the largest independent used and new bookstore in the world			0
on @entity37 , you can find independent boutiques and a variety of welcoming , low - key yet scrumptious restaurants and bars			0
speaking of restaurants , to talk about @entity11 and not mention the food would be a travesty			1
my top three culinary takeaways from the city : 1			0
veggie variety : a foodie 's nirvana , @entity11 restaurants offer outstanding farm - to - table dining options , and i personally reveled in the volume of vegetarian fare on @entity11 menus			1
@entity61 : " where the magic is in the hole ! " @entity61 is a little slice of heaven on @entity66 , at least for those of us who never outgrew breakfast cereal and lunch pail food and still fantasize about having sizable helpings of it heaped upon our baked goods			0
farmers market : be sure to check out the amazing @entity76 at @entity77			0
i ca n't think of a better way to start a saturday than an outdoor market filled with fresh - brewed , caffeinated beverages , delicious fruits and nuts and aromatic baked goods			0
and since no dining experience would be complete without liquid pleasures , it 's worth mentioning that many restaurants employ top mixologists to hand - craft cocktails with seasonal fresh ingredients and house - infused spirits			2
the proverbial icing on the cake is that , while @entity11 makes it easy to indulge , it also makes it easy to do so without guilt			1
the city is active and facilitates walking , jogging and biking , providing a plethora of areas and paths to do so			0
my favorites are those along the @entity26			0
plus , there 's endless potential for more adventurous outdoor activities , given the proximity of @entity110 , the aforementioned @entity26 and the @entity111			2
( you can only imagine my delight at spotting the rock from " the @entity115 " along the coastline ! ) if you 're more of a city person , you can use public transit to get around town			2
@entity11 has dedicated bus lanes in the clean downtown area , which stays immaculate partially as a function of the " waste cans " that not only accommodate trash , but recyclable disposables			1
it 's the most charming of places , and when you visit , you 'll think you 've died and gone to , well , @entity11 .			1
