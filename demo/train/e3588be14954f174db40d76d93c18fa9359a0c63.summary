-- women run a lower risk of having babies with certain birth defects if they eat a diet rich in fruits , vegetables , and whole grains during their childbearing years , a new study suggests			1
women who followed healthy @entity12 - style diets in the year before pregnancy were up to one - half as likely as those who ate diets high in meat , fat , and sugar to have a baby with anencephaly , a neural - tube defect that blocks the development of the brain and tends to result in miscarriage			1
compared with fat - and sugar - heavy diets , healthier diets -- which included plenty of folate , iron , and calcium -- were also associated with up to a one - third lower risk of cleft lip , a one - quarter lower risk of cleft palate , and a one - fifth lower risk of spina bifida , another neural - tube defect			1
" diet quality matters , and it was protective , " says @entity39 , @entity40 , the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics at the @entity44 , in @entity45 , @entity46			0

they have become less common since the 1990s , when government health officials led a campaign to increase folic - acid intake among pregnant women through supplements and fortified grain products			2
deficiencies in folic acid -- the synthetic form of folate , a b vitamin -- have been linked to both neural - tube defects and cleft lip and palate			1
@entity39 and her colleagues took into account whether the women in the study were taking folic acid , which suggests that a healthy diet provides protection against birth defects over and above that provided by folic acid			1
women of childbearing age should , however , still take folic - acid supplements , says @entity81 , @entity40 , a professor of community health services at the @entity83 , in @entity84			2
" folic acid has made a difference , " says @entity85 , who was not involved in the study			2
" in countries that have used fortification levels higher than the @entity91 , it has made an even bigger impact			0

@entity39 and her colleagues took a different approach by looking at overall diet quality -- a method that has become common in cancer and heart - disease research			0
the government - funded study , which appears this week in the @entity110 , compared the diets of 3,824 mothers whose children experienced birth defects with those of 6,807 mothers of healthy children			1
the researchers collected detailed questionnaires about the women 's diets in the year before they became pregnant , and used that data to score their diet quality on two indexes , one modeled on the @entity91 @entity125 dietary guidelines and another based on the @entity12 diet			1
both indexes considered fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and " good " fats to be healthy , and saturated fats and sweets to be unhealthy			0
@entity0 : good fats , bad fats : how to choose across the board , women with the healthiest diets were far less likely to have had children with birth defects than the women with the poorest - quality diets			1
high scores on both indexes were associated with a reduced risk of defects , although the association was stronger for the @entity125 score			0
seventy - eight percent of the women took supplements containing folic acid during early pregnancy , but higher - quality diets were protective regardless of whether the women took folic acid			1
the study authors and other experts strongly recommend that pregnant women continue taking folic - acid supplements			2
but the study does raise the general question of whether " eating the right foods " can provide health benefits that supplements do not , says @entity166 , @entity40 , a professor of public health at the @entity168 , in @entity169			0

" if you would like to be healthy , the better way to do that is by getting what you need from food rather than isolated compounds			0
