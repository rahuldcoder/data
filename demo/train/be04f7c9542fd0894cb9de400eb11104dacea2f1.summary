-- in the internet age , we have no choice but to entrust our data with private companies : e-mail providers , service providers , retailers , and so on			1
we realize that this data is at risk from hackers			2
but there 's another risk as well : the employees of the companies who are holding our data for us			1
in the early years of @entity18 , employees had a master password that enabled them to view anything they wanted in any account			2
@entity23 employees occasionally snoop on their friends and partners			2
the agency even has a name for it : @entity28			0
and well before the @entity33 , people with access to police or medical records occasionally used that power to look up either famous people or people they knew			0
the latest company accused of allowing this sort of thing is @entity40 , the @entity33 car - ride service			1
the company is under investigation for spying on riders without their permission			1
called the " god view , " some @entity40 employees are able to see who is using the service and where they 're going -- and used this at least once in 2011 as a party trick to show off the service			1
a senior executive also suggested the company should hire people to dig up dirt on their critics , making their database of people 's rides even more " useful			0
" none of us wants to be stalked -- whether it 's from looking at our location data , our medical data , our emails and texts , or anything else -- by friends or strangers who have access due to their jobs			2
unfortunately , there are few rules protecting us			2
government employees are prohibited from looking at our data , although none of the @entity28 creeps were ever prosecuted			1
the @entity78 law protects the privacy of our medical records , but we have nothing to protect most of our other information			0
your @entity18 and @entity40 data are only protected by company culture			1
there 's nothing in their license agreements that you clicked " agree " to but did n't read that prevents those companies from violating your privacy			2
corporate databases containing our data should be secured from everyone who does n't need access for their work			1
voyeurs who peek at our data without a legitimate reason should be punished			0
there are audit technologies that can detect this sort of thing , and they should be required			0
as long as we have to give our data to companies and government agencies , we need assurances that our privacy will be protected			1
moreover , we need legal limits on what can be done with our data			0
companies are starting to analyze our personal data and publish the results , sometimes in an effort to get positive press			1
and while it may be fun for @entity40 to publish data on riders heading off to one - night stands and hookups with prostitutes ( @entity40 recently deleted both posts ) , or for @entity125 to publish their users ' sexual preferences and habits , this is very intimate information			1
were @entity40 or @entity125 a university , this analysis would have to be approved by an ethics board entrusted with protecting the subjects ' privacy			1
private companies ' research is n't overseen in any way , meaning that no one reviews this research with an eye towards protecting the subjects			1
making these changes does n't require an act of @entity143			0
it 's something that the @entity145 can do under the auspices of consumer protection			0
as long as companies are collecting and storing our data , they need to be held to standards of security and professionalism			1
the general problem of our data being accessible wo n't go away			0
there are huge benefits in putting your data in the cloud , and that 's not going to change			0
companies like @entity163 and @entity18 need to be able to work on the computers and networks that contain your data , so engineers will need access			2
unless your data on these other computers is encrypted -- and in many cases it will never be because that renders it useless -- interested people will be able to access your personal information			0
we 're now living in a world where a lot of intimate data is stored in some third - party database somewhere -- the emails and texts we send and receive , our location data from our cell phones , the things we purchase , the web pages we look at , and the search terms we use			0
this data is bought and sold , and used to manipulate us with personalized advertising			0
but there 's something extra-creepy about people using it to stalk us or analyze our lifestyles			0
corporate collection of our data has long outpaced the laws protecting us			1
we need to rewrite those laws for the information age .			0

@entity40 is under investigation for spying on riders without their permission
@entity208 : *increasingly* , employees of companies can look at our private data
even the *federal* trade commission can ask companies to *increase* standards of security
