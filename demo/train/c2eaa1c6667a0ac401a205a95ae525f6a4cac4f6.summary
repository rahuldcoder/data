when vulnerable @entity1 fled president @entity2 this year , they left on the table a national midterm message that voters say is often the top issue for them : their wallets			1
the national unemployment rate is at its lowest since 2008 and the stock market continues to break record highs -- not universal indicators of widespread wealth , but prominent signals that the economy is recovering from the @entity15			0
and at a much more granular level , gas prices have hit their lowest level in nearly four years , the national average creeping below $ 3 a gallon and putting more money back into the pockets of nearly every voter with a car			1
but you do n't see vulnerable @entity1 trumpeting those economic gains in ads this fall as they try to keep @entity1 seats blue			1
instead , vulnerable candidates have focused on women 's issues ( see sen. @entity31 in @entity32 ) and have spent most of their time trying to deflect attacks and set themselves apart from @entity35 and @entity2			0
the lack of messaging on the improved economy is also because economic indicators do n't always translate into voters ' minds , @entity36 , director of the @entity38 's @entity37 , said			2
" people do n't feel the recovery and they are still worried about the economy , " @entity36 said			0
" a candidate who in essence says you have n't had it so good -- even if backed up by the facts -- seems out of touch			0
" economic gains are also a hard sell for the president 's party in a midterm election , he added			1
and in @entity61 while gas prices have even fallen below the national average , sen. @entity58 is an example of vulnerable @entity1 who have avoided talking up economic gains			1
@entity64 , spokesman for the coordinated @entity66 effort in @entity61 , said positive economic news has largely stayed off the campaign trail because " a lot of @entity70 are still having a tough time			1
" " i 'm sure everyone appreciates being able to gas up their car for a little bit less this month , but there 's still a lot of work that remains to be done on the economy , " @entity64 said			0
but when there 's bad news at the pump , it 's almost always a campaign issue			0
republicans wasted no time blaming @entity2 and @entity1 when gas prices shot up to nearly $ 4 a gallon in 2011			1
" if they were at a four year high i think you 'd be hearing a lot more about them , " @entity88 , a political scientist at the @entity89 , said			0
" i think @entity1 have had a hard time wanting to run on these positive national indicators in part because the president is still relatively unpopular and if they try to nationalize the election in some way by focusing on these positive indicators , basically they would just be reminding people that the election is about @entity2			1
" and that 's exactly what @entity85 did this cycle : turn the election into a mandate on @entity2 's presidency and weaving a narrative of what they see as the @entity2 administration incompetency			0
and that crisis of confidence has kept @entity1 from touting the lowest unemployment rate in six years as well as low interest rates , increased consumer spending and gdp growth that have economists feeling glib			1
and from @entity120 to @entity121 , other issues have also overshadowed @entity1 ' attempts to keep on their key issue points of raising the minimum wage and fighting for equal pay			1
" @entity121 has sucked the oxygen out of the room , " said @entity126 , a former @entity128 @entity127 correspondent and the @entity129 and public affairs at @entity131 said			0
" other noise , other stories just dominated the news and made it difficult for any @entity138 , including the president , to break through			2
" and the crises helped compound the @entity85 argument that the country is headed on the wrong track -- even a dangerous one -- and that the @entity2 administration and @entity1 are responsible			2
nearly two - thirds of @entity70 believe the country is headed in the wrong direction , according to the latest @entity150 / @entity149 poll			2
" [ @entity121 and @entity120 ] have added a vague sense of menace , a vague sense of anxiety and unease , " @entity126 said			2
" they add to a sense that things are out of control			0
that this administration is reacting -- following not leading			0
" and while @entity2 has consistently reminded the public that his " policies are on the ballot " -- chagrining @entity66 operatives -- it seems his economic policies have n't made the cut .			2

despite good economic news and record - low gas prices , @entity1 have still struggled this cycle
an unpopular president has kept *democrats* from talking up economic gains
and with many @entity70 still *hurting* , it 's difficult to boast economic growth
plus , crises like @entity121 and @entity120 have *crowded* out @entity66 talking points
