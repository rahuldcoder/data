@entity0 -- " @entity2 , so far from @entity3 and so close to the @entity4 , " is something i heard a lot growing up in @entity8 in the 1980s			1
how that saying , first coined by president @entity10 around the turn of the 20th century , resonates today			0
with the @entity4 election next door , @entity8 seems not only far from @entity3 , but forgotten			1
in the past six years , 60,000 people have died in drug - related violence			1
some say the death toll could be as high as 100,000			0
yet the violence here did n't make it into the last @entity4 presidential debate between @entity22 and @entity23			1
we may share a 2,000 mile border , but the view from here -- notwithstanding our trade relationship and the hunger for drugs in the @entity4 that is fueling the bloodshed and flooding my country with weapons -- is that we 're truly off the radar			1
map : @entity37 weighs in on @entity4 election " we ca n't blame the @entity4 for the violence in @entity8 , " says @entity39 , an investigative journalist who has put her life on the line writing about @entity8 's drug lords			1
" we have to look at our own corruption , the terrible impunity and lack of justice			0
we have to fix these problems ourselves , not wait for @entity22 or @entity23			0
but that @entity8 did n't even warrant one line in the last debate , when we have thousands dead , and even two @entity52 agents nearly killed in an ambush recently -- that tells you that the @entity4 -- @entity8 relationship is not going to change			1
" so much has happened in @entity8 since outgoing president @entity56 of the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) declared war on organized crime in 2006 that it 's hard to keep pace with how much the country has changed			1
hard to come to grips with the pain of families i 've met during my years covering the drug war -- whose fathers , mothers , brothers , sisters , sons and daughters have come to an untimely and tragic end			1
postcard : is @entity22 still @entity76 's favorite son ? because it is hard to understand how we got here , i think back to the time when i was a child here -- back then , the @entity83 , or @entity83 , dominated @entity8 -- and miles of walls across the country had the @entity83 logo painted in @entity8 's flag colors of green , white and red			1
one party , one ideology			0
one powerful broadcaster that fed us party propaganda			0
that was just the way it was			0
very early on , during family trips to @entity100 , i learned that the @entity4 meant choice			2
in the @entity4 you could get a whole range of shoes , not just the boxy and nerdy @entity106 shoes available to schoolchildren in @entity8			1
it meant playing @entity109 , watching the film " @entity112 , " not being spoon - fed soppy telenovelas			2
but the best , in my view : snickers and @entity115 , not the slim , omnipresent @entity117 chocolate bars available back home			0
postcard : @entity120 enjoy election soap opera the electoral process in @entity8 back then was just like its chocolate , not only insipid but worse -- a foregone conclusion			1
what we looked forward to was the " dedazo , " when the president would figuratively wag his finger in the direction of his successor thereby naming his replacement			0
meanwhile in the @entity4 , elections seemed much more colorful			2
one of my first memories of a @entity4 election was of @entity138 , the peanut farmer from @entity139 who talked about human rights vs. @entity141 , the actor from @entity142 who talked about the " @entity143			1
" here were two very different men with two very different ideologies			0
in contrast , the stream of gray men running @entity8 endured			2
this period was marked by a couple of national tragedies -- the nationalization of the banks in 1982 , and the calamitous 1985 earthquake , which rocked the @entity83 to its core			0
postcard : @entity22 finds support among @entity158 in 1994 , on the eve of the @entity161 rebellion , @entity8 joined the @entity162 and for better or for worse , you could eventually get @entity165 bars in nearly every shop corner			2
at the same time the media was becoming freer and more robust			0
in @entity8 we have tended to see the @entity4 elections through the prism of trade , as with @entity162 , or through immigration , as one out of every 10 @entity8 lives in the @entity4 the 9/11 terrorist attacks shifted @entity176 's focus from immigration to waging war in @entity179 and @entity180			1
@entity8 , understandably , was not a priority			2
fast forward to 2006 , a little over five years into our nascent democracy with the @entity57 in power after 71 years of autocratic @entity83 rule : five severed heads were rolled into a nightclub in @entity187 , @entity188			2
this sort of thing did n't happen under the @entity83 , and the violence has continued unabated to this day			2
postcard : why @entity193 , @entity4 are kindred spirits " there have been 30,000 killed in @entity197 and 60,000 killed in @entity8 , many of whom the government says belonged to criminal groups			1
yet @entity8 did n't figure in the debate			1
it 's shocking , appalling and disturbing , " says @entity202 , a political analyst here			0
" if @entity8 had been mentioned it may have been in the ' failed state ' category along with @entity211 , " counters @entity206 of the @entity207			1
" so a mention is not always a good thing			0
" in recent years i 've travelled back and forth to the front lines of the drug war , but i always return to the safety of @entity0 , which so far seems to be cocooned from the bloodshed			1
postcard : war - scarred @entity220 has little faith in election but despite living in @entity0 today , it 's hard not to see everything -- including the @entity4 election -- through the very dark spectacles of the drug war			1
" that 's exactly the problem , " says @entity0 mayor @entity228 , from the left - of - center @entity229 ( @entity230 )			2
his government says it has significantly decreased crime in the last six years -- an improvement from when @entity0 used to be a hotbed of crime			0
today victims of the drug war are taking refuge here , and even journalists from violence - ridden states are seeking exile in the capital			1
there is no denying that @entity0 is going through some sort of renaissance			0
not only are the days of rampant kidnappings behind us , the capital 's also become more liberal , more culturally rich and more tolerant			0
postcard : @entity22 's ' hope ' a mirage for hostile @entity211 yet , i tell @entity228 , @entity0 only seems safe because we 're comparing it to a level of violence we never had in the rest of the country			2
" imagine if we had a different strategy -- the tactic of confrontation -- to get rid of crime , " @entity228 told me			0
" we 'd have more blood			0
" as i write surrounded by boxes before an impending move to @entity267 , i see the @entity83 's comeback with president elect @entity269 as a direct result of the @entity57 's failure			0
and i see @entity0 as a reflection of what the rest of the country can one day become			0
as for @entity3 , he 's still very far away from here			0
and the @entity4 elections ? largely irrelevant to most @entity8 , except for @entity280 , a @entity0 taxi driver who put it this way : " it does n't matter who wins the @entity4 elections , they just better send the loser to sort things out here ! "			1
