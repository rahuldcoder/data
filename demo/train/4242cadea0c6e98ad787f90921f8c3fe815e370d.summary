@entity2 @entity0 , one of @entity4 's longtime confidants and former policy adviser , dropped whatever coyness was left regarding the former secretary of state 's all - but - certain presidential run at an event on tuesday night			1
addressing an audience of about 150 people at an @entity13 event , @entity0 -- president of the @entity15 -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			2
" i am really exited for these next two years			2
with any @entity22 adventure , it is a roller coaster			0
it is going to be very exciting , " @entity0 said			0
" she is really going to need all of us to step up , step in , be involved , fight for her , be a voice for her			0
" @entity0 closed the speech with a call to action for the crowd by referencing @entity22 's failed 2008 campaign			1
" i look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail , in @entity17			0
i still have ptsd , " she said , referring to the fact that @entity22 finished third in the caucus			0
" so maybe i will be spending my time in @entity18 , @entity19			0
i will say one thing about @entity4 , she always remembers , she always remembers her friends , in good times and in bad , so i know it will be an adventure , but i am glad we will all be doing it together			0
" @entity0 , who has worked with @entity22 since 1997 , is very close with the former first lady			1
the two regularly speak and because of their relationship , @entity0 has been sheepish in the past to comment on her possible 2016 run			2
when @entity22 ran for @entity48 in 2000 , @entity0 was her deputy campaign manager and issues director and went on to serve as legislative director in @entity22 's @entity48 office			1
when @entity22 ran for president , @entity0 served as policy director and adviser			1
" when you are making decisions , whether you are secretary of state , or senator , first lady , or future president , it matters who is at that table , " @entity0 said at the event			0
" i can tell you , we will be at that table if she is president			0
" @entity69 , a spokeswoman for the @entity15 , said that @entity0 was " kidding about spending time in those states â€” she 's not going anywhere			1
" see also : @entity22 prepares for 2016 with staff picks , meetings " @entity0 was n't saying [ @entity22 ] would run , but what it would be like if she did run , " she said			1
of course , it is the worst kept secret in @entity2 that @entity22 is running for president			0
in the past two months , the former first lady has hired a number of top staffers and been meeting with advisers to chat out a strategic course for a presidential run			1
@entity0 has not said whether or not she would leave the think - tank and join the likely @entity22 campaign			1
the @entity89 reported in 2013 that @entity0 would not return to a hypothetical campaign			0
@entity92 , on the other hand , reported that @entity0 was " likely to play an informal role if she [ @entity22 ] runs			2
" the think - tank president has been equally coy about whether or not @entity22 will run at all			2
" i honestly believe that whoever runs for president , " @entity0 told the @entity89 , " is going to have to have a vision of how to grow this economy in a way that 's more shared than it has been			2
" @entity102 , founder of @entity103 , reflected on @entity0 's comments to his organization by saying this : " we are always as ready for @entity0 as we are for @entity4			1

one of @entity4 's closest confidants hinted at likely presidential run on tuesday
