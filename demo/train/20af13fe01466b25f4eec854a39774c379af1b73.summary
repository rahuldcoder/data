-- @entity2 's security can only be assured when its neighbors believe that it is no longer oppressing the @entity6 people but instead living in peace and harmony with them			1
the de facto strategy of past and present @entity2 governments of seeking security through domination and by pushing @entity6 out of their homes , or allowing right - wing religious fanatics to create settlements throughout the @entity16 to ensure that no @entity6 state could have contiguous parts , has not and can not work to provide safety for @entity2			1
@entity2 's fate and its well - being are intrinsically linked to the well - being of the @entity6 people			1
it 's time for the powerful to show generosity to the relatively powerless			1
so those in the @entity26 and @entity2 who want @entity2 to be secure should welcome the @entity28 's decision to seek observer status as a nonmember state in the @entity31			1
the authority has agreed to return to negotiations with @entity2 without conditions once that status has been granted			0
the goal is creation of a state living in peace with @entity2 in borders roughly approximating those of the before than 1967 war , with minor border changes mutually agreeable through negotiations			0
so who opposes this ? @entity46 , @entity2 and the @entity26 opinion : @entity6 move at @entity31 wo n't solve anything why @entity46 ? because @entity46 ' strategy is to keep their area so powerless that the @entity6 people will turn away from support for the secular and peace - oriented and nonviolence - committed @entity28			1
so the last thing @entity46 wants is for the @entity28 to win popular esteem by being seen as having " delivered " a real tangible accomplishment to the @entity6 people in the form of statehood			1
to the extent that even observer status is a step in that direction , powerful elements in @entity46 want to undermine it			2
in fact , @entity46 consistently tries to undermine the @entity28			2
that explains why it has been so unwilling in the past years to stop its war crimes against @entity2 civilians by sending ( thankfully , mostly inefficient ) missiles toward @entity74 and other parts of southern @entity2			0
but even as they fall short of their targets , @entity46 manages to create fear and trauma for millions of @entity2			2
why @entity2 ? because the @entity80 dominated government does not want a @entity6 state to emerge that would limit the ability of the @entity2 settlers to expand their hold on much of the @entity16			2
so while they sometimes talk about a two - state solution , they have in mind a tiny state that would not be economically or politically viable			0
its strategy : insist that it can not negotiate seriously with the @entity28 on creation of a state because the authority can not control @entity46			2
with that reasoning , they ask how can @entity2 be expected to work with the authority on terms for a peace treaty that would actually be viable ? and then simultaneously , @entity2 strengthens @entity46 in various predictable ways			0
@entity6 @entity31 bid explained its first move in this direction was to pull out of @entity107 militarily without negotiating for the @entity28 to take over control there , de facto leaving @entity107 in the hands of @entity46			1
if the pull - out had been done in cooperation with the @entity28 , there would have been no missiles and hence no " proof " that giving up land to the @entity6 would only increase @entity2 vulnerability			1
to keep any substantial @entity6 state from developing , the government of prime minister @entity119 has managed , in the latest @entity121 ( whose cease - fire is for the moment holding ) to strengthen @entity46			1
it allowed @entity46 to show that it can fight back against @entity2 assault in contrast to the @entity28 who , @entity46 points out , has gotten nothing in return for the past five years of complete non-violence and security cooperation with the @entity133 ( @entity133 )			1
@entity119 is not stupid , and this is an intended outcome			0
the shelling of @entity2 sites killed five people			0
@entity2 bombing killed 150 @entity6			0
yet the air raids and missiles aimed at @entity2 again stimulated the latent post-traumatic stress disorder among @entity2 that leads so many to vote for right - wing parties against their own best interests out of fear of the @entity6 people , most of whom would like to live in peace with @entity2			0
( @entity6 told me when i visited a few weeks ago that the ongoing trauma of the occupation is so present it ca n't become post-traumatic )			0
palestinians again take status case to @entity31 as long as @entity46 is seen as the main face of @entity6 , even centrist and left - wing @entity2 will support militarism rather than peace compromises			1
why the @entity26 ? the @entity159 administration gave a green light to @entity2 's attack on @entity107 , refused to support calls for an immediate cease - fire and has now joined @entity2 in opposition to upping @entity6 status at the @entity31 the most charitable explanation is the @entity159 team believes the @entity119 government will never negotiate a reasonable deal with the @entity6 and so has turned its attention to trying to gaining leverage with @entity2 to stop it from dragging the @entity26 into a war with @entity173			1
and for that , it 's willing to ditch the @entity28 , even though it certainly knows that the authority might soon collapse unless it can deliver something real for its people			0
in my recent book , " embracing @entity2 / @entity186 " ( @entity187 , 2012 ) , i show that @entity2 will be safe when it becomes famous not for its power but for its spirit of generosity and open - hearted caring for the @entity6 people			1
i 've outlined how a @entity188 to eliminate poverty in @entity2 and the surrounding states would totally change the political dynamics and create the preconditions for lasting peace			0
a similar path would make the @entity26 far more popular and far more powerful around the world			0
but this strategy of generosity will take a major paradigm shift in the consciousness of @entity26 and @entity2 , and for the moment , that seems unlikely			2
but it 's worth fighting for			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rabbi @entity205 .			2

rabbi @entity205 : @entity2 can not achieve security by dominating @entity6
he says the powerful should show more generosity to the relatively powerless
@entity2 , @entity26 should support @entity6 move for nonmember state status at the @entity31 , he says
@entity205 : @entity46 serves @entity119 's aim of *marginalizing* the @entity28
