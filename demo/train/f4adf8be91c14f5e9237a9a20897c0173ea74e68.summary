lots of stern - faced @entity2 politicians and so - called experts have been asking : what is @entity7 president @entity6 's endgame in @entity8 ? the presence of @entity7 troops in @entity11 has sent alarm bells ringing in @entity2 capitals , with some people predicting that it is basically a prelude to a full - blown invasion of predominantly @entity7 speaking eastern parts of the country , with @entity7 tanks rolling in			1
calls were also made for the " world community , " whatever that means these days , to punish @entity7 economically and diplomatically , although no one is talking about any military response			2
very hard to see though how @entity2 countries can exert serious economic pressure on @entity7 , considering the state of their economies and possible huge losses they will incur			1
symbolically , yes , they can , say , cancel some business conferences and maybe even refuse to sign a deal or two			0
but that would be all			0
we have already found out the @entity37 government is not considering any military options or trade sanctions after a cunning cameramen picked up an official carrying a policy document near 10 @entity43 , zooming in on the relevant paragraph			0
although , as a former @entity47 adviser , i can tell you that such things do n't happen by accident and usually have all to do with sending out a signal to those who are watching carefully			2
other countries have also signaled their lack of any desire to resort to sanctions			0
opinion : @entity6 's @entity8 endgame @entity60 president @entity59 and secretary of state @entity61 have been warning @entity7 about costs and punishments , if it does not withdraw its troops back to the @entity66 naval base in @entity67			1
the @entity68 has been saying that economic sanctions against @entity7 are in the making and that all military programs between the two countries are on hold			1
other suggested punishments being looked at include boycotting the @entity76 summits in @entity77 in june and even banning @entity7 altogether from this gathering , which , incidentally , has been losing its relevance in the past decade or so			2
i mean , who is going to treat seriously the supposed group of the biggest industrial nations if it does n't include @entity84 and @entity85 but has @entity86 and @entity87 in it , no offence to these two great nations			0
the thing about the crisis in @entity8 is that the @entity92 has greatly misjudged the way @entity7 would respond to the possibility of its neighbor sliding into chaos and anarchy , with the so - called interim unity government in @entity99 failing to establish its authority in the east and south of the country			1
not to mention that the children of the @entity105 revolution of 2004 , which , by the way , eventually ended in tears for most of them , have swallowed more than they can chew when they toppled president @entity110 , and then made a crucial mistake of making all the wrong noises from day one , demonstrating open hostility to @entity7 and to the ethnic @entity7 living in @entity8			1
and when the dust began to settle in @entity99 and news emerged that out of the 98 people who died , at least 16 were police officers , the image of a glorious people 's revolution somehow lost its initial appeal			0
and with the failed attempts by some extremists to spread the influence of the interim government to the east and south , using intimidation and violence , it became clear that a prospect of a civil war looked very real indeed			0
opinion : how @entity6 carries out power grab so here 's the deal then : as @entity8 was slipping into anarchy and chaos , with all sorts of radicals causing mayhem , president @entity6 's endgame became obvious			2
he needed to do anything in his power to prevent @entity8 from becoming another @entity145 , with a possibility of a civil war breaking out and violence spreading to @entity7 at some point			1
we should learn the lessons of @entity145 where the delicate balance , which had existed there before the @entity60 - led invasion of 2003 , was undermined and no one now knows how to resolve it			2
the same outcome happened as a result of the so - called revolution in @entity99 that has now opened up old wounds and awoken historical animosities that had been kept in check			0
so @entity6 has chosen to use the 25,000 @entity7 troops based at @entity67 , reinforcing them with another 16,000 soldiers , to prevent clashes between radicals on all sides erupting and provide stability in @entity11 where about 60 % of the population are ethnic @entity7			1
without a shot being fired , so unlike the rest of the country , law and order have been established			0
all the @entity8 military installations in @entity176 were surrounded by @entity7 troops with one purpose : to prevent undesirables arming themselves , like it happened in @entity181 and some other cities , with disastrous circumstances			1
up to now the plan has worked			0
but any suggestions that the @entity47 is actually ready to start a full - blown invasion of @entity8 are way , way off the mark			1
this would be very dangerous for @entity7 itself , considering it close links with @entity8 on all levels			1
so the hysteria surrounding the @entity7 involvement in @entity11 at the moment is either caused by ignorance or is a result of the deep suspicions that the @entity92 still has about @entity7 , @entity199 or no @entity199			1
a sudden regime change that has happened in @entity8 could never result in a swift and peaceful resolution			0
we saw that during the @entity203 and , less recently , in the fall of @entity205 in @entity206			0
that is why all sides in the @entity8 crisis need to keep a cool head and refrain from one - sided propaganda and provocative , inflammatory statements			2
if one thing that we have learned for history it 's that it does n't take a lot for a big war to erupt in @entity206 , dragging the rest of the world in it .			0
