-- @entity2 's time as " @entity3 " has finally come to a close , and despite the season 's weird and fairly unsatisfactory ending , it actually provided us with a few solid " @entity9 " options			1
if i 'm being honest , my first choice for the next " @entity9 " was single mother @entity12 , a.k.a. the most refreshingly normal " bachelor " contestant in the show 's history			1
but after she revealed her current " situation " of happiness during the " women tell all " special , i jumped to my second choice : @entity22			1
that being said , i also would 've watched a season that followed the adventures of @entity26 and @entity27 , and after last night 's finale , i actually would n't mind watching @entity29 search for love			2
( yes , i said it			0
) and lastly , @entity32 is just so weird that i 'd watch her season as well			0
' @entity9 ' : see full coverage but as we all learned last night , @entity22 is the lucky lady about to embark on her own adventure to find love ( and a worthwhile visit to the fantasy suite )			1
some people love the choice â € ” me â € ” and others hate it			2
then there are those who just do n't know what to expect			2
here 's how i think @entity22 's season will unfold ( and why it will be entertaining to watch ) : @entity45 , meet @entity46 : for starters , if i had to compare @entity22 to previous " bachelorettes , " i 'd say we can expect something along the lines of a mix between @entity45 and @entity53			1
@entity22 is smart , and she seems to have her feet planted firmly on the ground			1
most importantly , she 's also very strong			0
honestly , leaving @entity2 post-fantasy suite is one of the reasons i like her so much			0
she knows what she wants , or at least what she does n't want , and she 's not hesitant to act on that			2
i keep thinking back to that time @entity45 all but chased @entity62 down until he would confront her about having a girlfriend back home			0
@entity45 was n't taking any crap , and i think @entity22 will approach this season in the same way			1
' the bachelor ' : see full coverage no more drama ( for the most part ) : from what we 've seen of @entity22 's fun side , she 's got a great sense of humor			1
what i liked most about her relationship with @entity2 early on was how they made fun of each other			0
and we can also assess her personality from the fact that all the women in the house seemed to love her			0
the only drama surrounding @entity22 involved her decision to leave , which was valid			1
@entity90 for the win : but let 's not forget the thing that 's going to play a big role in her season : her father			0
confession time ? i love @entity22 's dad			1
he was the perfect mix of total softie and tough guy			0
i can not wait for @entity22 to introduce these new fellas to her family			1
andi - isms : looking back on @entity2 's season , i love that @entity22 was the girl who brought a one - piece to the house			1
she 's also the girl who brought @entity2 to a shooting range			0
no matter what , she 's going to be herself , and she genuinely does n't seem to be on television for the press â € ” she 's an attorney , for goodness sake			2
horrible dancing : you know that some guy is going to make her dance with him , and we all know how awful ( yet charming ) that will be			0
honestly , i think @entity22 is the type of person i would be friends with			1
i think she 's relatively easygoing , and i am going to thoroughly enjoy watching her facial expressions when , inevitably , some guy tries to win her over with a cheesy line or a striptease or something			0
all in all , i foresee it being a normal , perfectly pleasant season ... so long as she does n't slowly start offending the entire country with off - camera conversations			2
