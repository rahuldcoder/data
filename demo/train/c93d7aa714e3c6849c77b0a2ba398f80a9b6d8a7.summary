it also enjoys a major tourism industry and @entity61 is a regional hub , providing financial and other services and is a continent leader on telephone banking			0
if significant oil reserves are found , this could be transformative for its economy			2

@entity29 has already been positioning itself to develop regional oil facilities for exports of oil from @entity52 and @entity91			1
@entity92 started in march on building a huge deep - water port in @entity94 , to service a pipeline across northern @entity29 to connect to the port			0
the @entity97 sees @entity29 as a regional anchor state although its reputation as a stable democracy , took a knocking with the surge of violence that followed the presidential elections in 2008			2
new presidential elections are scheduled late 2012 or 2013 , and oil will additionally raise anticipation of the spoils of billions of future oil dollars for the victorious			0
the stakes in these elections have just risen , and the resilience of @entity29 's institutions to ensure a fair election , but also its politicians to gracefully accept defeat is critical			2
