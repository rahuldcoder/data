@entity0 -- when i tell people our cat takes an antidepressant , i usually get a funny look			1
i might as well add that i worship @entity8 , am romantically involved with a @entity9 ( let 's call it @entity12 ) , and drive a car that i knitted myself out of gnu fur			1
putting your pet on psychotropic medication tends to suggest to others that it is you , not your cat , who needs help			1
to be fair to those i told this to , who perhaps thought my husband and i were escaped mental patients , i would have thought the same thing a few years ago			2
before she lived with us , our cat @entity31 resided in a garbage area			1
after we adopted her , every time we went away , @entity31 would succumb to extreme urinary tract infections , at which point through no fault of her own our whole apartment morphed into one big litter box			2
antibiotics , and even surgery , failed to address this problem			1
finally , after a particularly aggressive infection that spread to the cat 's kidneys , our vet recommended the happy pills			1
" she is internalizing her anxiety and it is affecting her bladder , " he explained			2
" she thinks when you leave the apartment , you 're leaving forever			0
she thinks she 's going back to the dump			1
" by this time , i was several thousand dollars worse off , maxed out on pet insurance and had spent four disconcerting days watching @entity31 refuse to eat or move			0
any remaining reservations i had about forcibly medicating an animal went out the window			0
so i fed @entity31 happy pills			0
several months later , after the amitriptyline the vet had prescribed had truly taken hold , @entity31 was a noticeably different beast			0
departure - related hysteria , puddle creation and the delightful nights of screeching all subsided			0
we felt guilty about forcing pills down her throat , which she often tried to hide and then spit out			0
but we were relieved that she was n't getting sick anymore , though she did seem floppier			1
apparently , our situation is not all that rare			0
dr. @entity72 , founder of the @entity73 , said many animal dysfunctions mimic human psychological issues			0
excessive grooming can be a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder , aggression and violence can indicate anxiety , and a refusal to eat can suggest depression in an animal			0
as with humans , these behaviors often can and should be first treated by adjusting the animal 's environment and behavior			1
but animals do n't speak , and they ca n't lie on a therapist 's sofa plumbing painful puppyhood / kittenhood memories for the roots of their neuroses , so there are limits to the scope of therapy for them			1
additionally , some issues are rarely treatable except with drugs -- for example , " urine - marking " in cats or thunderstorm phobia in dogs			0
dr. @entity109 , professor for primary care at @entity111 , said many pets ' troubles can be traced to human owners			1
we trap them in our homes , expose them to fireworks or force them to live with other animals they may intensely dislike			0
to you they may be @entity125 and @entity126 ; to them it might be @entity129 and @entity130			0
the question of what kinds of feelings animals have and whether those feelings can , or should , be effectively treated with medication is , as you might imagine , controversial			1
@entity72 said that while it 's fairly evident that animals experience primary emotions such as fear , what has been more hotly debated is whether they have secondary emotions like jealousy and guilt			2
those require the animal to have a sense of its own existence			0
it 's easy to laugh at the idea of @entity153 taking an antidepressant and to dismiss owners who medicate their pets as urban nut cases who probably also kit their pooch out in @entity161 sweaters and tote them around in a birkin bag			1
but i think it 's a huge disservice to animals to discount a medicated approach			2
i do n't believe @entity31 thinks like a person , that she feels self - conscious about her saggy undercarriage or remorseful about waking me up by meowing in my face			2
but i know she was unhappy			0
antidepressants may not be a cure - all for every ailment or behavioral issue , but they 're a step to discuss with your vet if you 're at the end of your leash			2
" if you 're really stuck and on the point of surrender , " @entity72 said , " do n't give your animal up before you try a course of medication			1
if all else fails , you may have to put aside your inner skeptic , swallow your pride and have your pet swallow some happy pills			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : i was advised to give my cat antidepressants after she had *recurrent* illnesses
@entity192 : antidepressants were a last resort , after antibiotics and surgery did n't work
she says her cat 's behavior and *health* *improved* after taking medication
@entity192 : people think giving pets psychotropic medication is a joke , but it has real *benefits*
