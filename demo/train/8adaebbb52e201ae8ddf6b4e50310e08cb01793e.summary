you 're settling into your tiny coach seat on your next business trip , and the person next to you starts coughing			0
in the past , you might have grumbled about him flying with a cold			0
but now travelers may want to know : does your seatmate have @entity8 ? probably not			0
but given the news of the past week , it 's hard not to worry			2
affected passengers may not show symptoms for up to 21 days , said @entity14 chief medical correspondent @entity13			0
case in point : @entity17 , the first @entity8 patient diagnosed in the @entity18 , was screened for the virus before departing @entity20 for the @entity18 on september 19 , but he did n't show symptoms until he had been in @entity22 for a few days			1
people who came into contact with him in the @entity18 are being tracked down for monitoring			1
how can air travelers stay calm ? travel blogger @entity28 , reached on thursday at 35,000 feet flying from @entity30 to @entity31 via @entity32 , takes a few additional steps to keep calm			2
@entity28 , who visits 20 countries and flies about 150,000 miles annually , knows how @entity8 is transmitted and is n't concerned about catching it			0
but he refuses to read stories about the disease to avoid panicking			2
@entity39 also carries surgical masks , which he will wear and offer to travelers " coughing and sneezing on me			0
" several airlines report they are following all @entity18 @entity45 protocols for keeping people with contagious diseases off their aircrafts			1
but a handful declined to give specifics about whether they 're now doing anything differently on @entity18 domestic flights			1
airplanes are given light cleanings between flights , a much heavier daily cleaning and even more on down time , experts tell @entity14			0
this is done to prevent transmission of common diseases , like the flu , via surfaces such as armrests			2
and it is much tougher to catch @entity8 than the flu			0
how @entity8 spreads in one @entity45 study , the ebola virus lived in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days			1
but the environment at an airport , for example , is not perfectly suited to support viruses			0
it 's unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person 's bodily fluids , said dr. @entity81 , director of @entity45 's @entity82			1
" this is not an airborne transmission , " @entity81 told @entity14			2
" there needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood			2
" your @entity8 questions answered guidance for travelers it 's no surprise that the @entity18 government recommends that travelers avoid areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with @entity8 patients			1
most people who have become infected with @entity8 lived with or cared for an ill patient , said @entity101 , deputy director of @entity45 's @entity102 for emerging zoonotic and @entity103			1
" it 's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers , " he said			1
ebola symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat ; followed by vomiting , diarrhea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and at advanced stage , both internal and external bleeding , according to the @entity120			0
" it is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel , " the @entity121 said in a statement			0
@entity17 flew on @entity126 for two legs of his journey , and passengers on those flights are not in danger , said a @entity126 spokesperson , noting the @entity45 advice on symptoms			1
" the ill person did not exhibit symptoms of @entity8 during the flights from @entity139 and @entity45 does not recommend that people on the same commercial airline flights undergo monitoring , as @entity8 is contagious only if the person is experiencing active symptoms , " advised the @entity45 , in a statement			1
the @entity45 is advising people to avoid all non-essential travel to @entity20 , @entity147 or @entity148			1
in addition , everyone leaving those three countries has their temperature checked before they 're allowed to board a plane			0
