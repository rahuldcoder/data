@entity0 -- while snow and ice continued to fall in parts of the northwest , others in the region struggled with the aftermath of the same winter storm -- including floods , slick roads , power outages and avalanche warnings			1
the system itself remained a threat , with winter storm warnings from the @entity18 in effect thursday night for parts of eight states -- @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
yet fresh precipitation was just one of many continuing concerns			1
chief among them was flooding , particularly in western @entity23 and southwest @entity22			1
@entity23 's capital city , @entity36 , which is situated along the @entity37 , issued an emergency declaration thursday afternoon			1
by then , at least 35 roadways had flooded and the @entity40 had set up a shelter amid fears that the situation will worsen			1
" water levels are projected to continue to rise , " the city said in a statement , noting that the @entity37 is projected to crest in the city at 30 feet around 4 p.m. on january 20			1

the city of @entity55 was evacuating about 50 families , including 30 to 40 elderly people , said @entity58 , spokeswoman for the @entity59			1

one car full of people drove into deep water and was swept into a canal			2
an adult and child were rescued , and a child 's body was recovered , @entity1 affiliate @entity72 reported			2
fire officials still have n't said how many people are missing			2
@entity79 told the station that he and a friend saw the driver steer into a swollen creek , perhaps thinking it was a road			2
" i did what i thought i could			2
i tried to open the doors			2
the doors were obviously locked			2
when he broke the window , i assumed the child in the back was old enough to get out through the window , " @entity79 said			2
" apparently , it was just an infant			0
" people in some mountainous areas were told to be on guard for avalanches			0
the @entity18 noted that " heavy new snow " falling on top of a " weak snowpack " heightened the threat in sections of @entity22 , @entity29 , @entity28 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
in more populated sections around @entity22 , many restaurants closed , hotels full and roads cluttered by fallen trees thursday			1
around @entity111 , south of @entity110 , dozens of cars were parked on steep hillsides -- evidently stranded there by drivers			0
and @entity1 affiliate @entity114 showed images of overturned vehicles and carports and awnings that collapsed under the weight of the snow			0
even after the worst of the snow and ice had passed , electricity outages remained a major headache			0
approximately 230,000 @entity127 customers were without power as of 4 p.m. thursday , the utility said on its @entity130 feed			1
the company said it had over 750 workers on the job , adding that " an additional 140 power line crews from other parts of the country will be assisting ( with ) repairs and restoration work			1
" " we ca n't make full estimate of how long the restoration effort will take until the ice and snow storm -- and the damage it 's causing -- ends and our crews can make a comprehensive assessment of the damage , " the utility wrote			1
" but right now , we think it will be 3 to 4 days ... maybe longer			0
" around @entity0 , city spokesman @entity149 said that about 2,200 households did n't have power late thursday afternoon			1
but he said he expects all those to have electricity again by midnight			0
@entity154 reported only minimal outages in @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity23 , including about 600 around @entity156 , @entity23 , who were expected to have their lights on again by midnight			1
roads remained perilous in large parts of @entity22 late thursday , though the situation had improved markedly since earlier in the day			1
the @entity163 noted , on its website , that disabled vehicles and collisions had caused back - ups on many major highways including @entity169 , @entity170 and i - 405			0
" collisions and tree limbs are piling up on state highways , " the @entity163 reported at midday thursday on its website			0
@entity1 ireporter @entity175 said the @entity178 area of @entity0 , where she lives , received more than 4 inches of snow			0
" the streets are not very drivable , " she said thursday			0
" most businesses are closed again today			0
most hills near me have turned into places to sled instead of drive			0
" the storm also stranded scores of air travelers thursday at @entity190 , which got 6.8 inches of snow on wednesday , shattering a 1954 record of 2.9 inches , officials said			1
by late thursday afternoon , all three of the airport 's runways were open -- after two of them had been closer earlier -- spokesman @entity193 said			0
but he noted that some flights then were still being canceled , because ice was being removed from 70 to 80 planes that had been parked overnight wednesday at the airport			0
even though the state had n't received requests for assistance " so far , " @entity22 gov. @entity202 proclaimed a state of emergency thursday " purely ( as ) a precautionary measure			1
" the step would allow for the activation of @entity211 troops and give state agencies more options to help cities and towns			0
" i want to make sure we have every resource available to ensure our communities are safe , " @entity202 said in a statement			0
the governor took action to ensure the delivery of dairy products with " a brief waiver of the restrictions on truck drivers ' work hours			0
" the measure " is needed now to avoid shipment delays that could mean the loss of nearly $ 1 million a day for the state 's dairy industry , " @entity202 said			0
@entity1 's @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
