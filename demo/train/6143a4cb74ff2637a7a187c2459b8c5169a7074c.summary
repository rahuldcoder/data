@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the @entity4 student convicted of killing her @entity6 roommate @entity7 in @entity1 , faced a surprise accusation monday from another man behind bars for the murder			1
@entity7 refused to say @entity12 was not involved -- and prosecutor @entity13 read out a letter saying @entity15 thought the @entity4 and her then - boyfriend had killed @entity17			1
@entity15 wrote to a news website in the spring of 2010 , after the three were convicted , referring to " a horrible homicide of a splendid young girl , @entity7 , by @entity3 and @entity22			1
" @entity13 produced a copy of the letter on monday during @entity12 's appeal against her conviction			2
defense lawyers said they did not know of the existence of the letter before @entity13 read it in court			0
@entity12 took the stand for emotional testimony after @entity15 spoke , saying she was " shocked			1
" " the only time that @entity7 , @entity22 and i were in one room together was in a court room ...			2
he knows what the truth is			0
i do n't know what happened that night , " she said			0
monday 's appeal hearing was the first time the three people convicted of the crime appeared in court together since a preliminary hearing years ago			2
@entity17 was found stabbed to death in 2007 at the house she shared with @entity12 in @entity0 , the central @entity1 town where both were students			1
she was semi-naked and her throat had been slashed			0
@entity12 , 23 , and her then - boyfriend @entity22 , 27 , were convicted of the murder in 2009			1
@entity15 was found guilty in a separate fast - track trial and sentenced to 16 years			1
defense lawyer @entity52 and @entity12 's mother @entity53 both rejected @entity15 's testimony monday			1
her father @entity12 , speaking to @entity2 from @entity55 , said it was " very disappointing that he will not own up to his responsibility			2
" under cross-examination , @entity15 said he had written what he always believed , but that it " was not up to me to say who was the killer			2
" @entity63 said @entity15 's letter was based on " a feeling " and that his accusations are not based on facts or events he witnessed			2
@entity53 said @entity15 " continues to lie about @entity3 and that 's unfortunate			1
" " he did n't say much			0
he refused to answer most of the important things , " she said			0
" @entity3 wanted to be able to confront him and she was denied that			0
" @entity53 said she had suffered watching her daughter testify : " it 's devastating to watch your child in pain			0
it 's horrible to see her go through that			0
" she said before the hearing she can not understand why @entity15 might spend only seven years behind bars if he is released early for good conduct , while @entity12 could serve 26 years			1
@entity22 said monday he and @entity12 had been behind bars for nearly four years , their lives destroyed based only on suppositions			0
@entity88 , the lawyer for the @entity17 family , said @entity15 's testimony was the first time he has said " clearly that the two defendants were present in the scene of the crime that night			1
" the hearing is now adjourned until july 25 , with further hearings on july 30 and august 1			0
the appeal hearing has heard a confusing array of stories from a range of convicted criminals this month			0
@entity15 had been called as a witness to corroborate the story of another convict who told the court just over a week ago that @entity15 had said @entity12 and @entity22 were not involved			1
but on the stand , he did not back @entity110 's version of events			0
as part of the appeal , forensic experts are retesting evidence that was used to convict @entity12			2
that evidence includes a knife found in @entity22 's apartment with @entity12 's dna on the handle and what @entity0 prosecutors say is @entity17 's dna in a tiny groove on the blade			1
the prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab @entity17 in the neck and that it had been cleaned			0
the dna matter attributed to @entity17 consists of flesh , not blood , they say			0
the sample , however , was so small that forensic scientists investigating @entity17 's murder were not able to double - test it in accordance with international forensic science norms , which @entity12 's legal team says raises doubts about its validity			1
the second piece of evidence the forensic experts are testing is the tiny metal clasp from @entity17 's bra , which was cut from her body after her slaying			2
an independent forensics study on the dna evidence is due thursday , @entity12 said monday			1
" we 're hopefully going to hear good news that it 's incompatibale to @entity3 and not useful , " @entity12 said			1
forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that @entity22 's dna is present on the metal clasp			0
the clasp was identified on an investigatory video the same day @entity17 's body was found			1
but it was not collected until nearly six weeks later , giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated			0
@entity2 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity12 hopes @entity153 report due thursday will help her defense , her father says
@entity3 says she is " shocked " by the testimony of @entity7
@entity15 , convicted separately of killing @entity7 , denies another convict 's story
@entity12 and her former boyfriend were found guilty in 2009 of killing @entity17 in @entity0
