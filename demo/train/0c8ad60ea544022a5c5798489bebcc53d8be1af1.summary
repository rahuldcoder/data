@entity0 , @entity1 -- another person has been added to the list of suspects in the january killing of a @entity9 leader in a @entity0 hotel , bringing the number of identified suspects to 27 , two sources told @entity2 on monday			1
twenty - six of the 27 were carrying @entity16 and @entity17 passports , authorities have said			0
the sources , an official familiar with the investigation and a police source , did not say which nation issued the passport the suspect used			2
@entity25 , a founding member of @entity9 ' military wing , was found dead january 20 in his @entity0 hotel room			1
police believe he was slain the night before , allegedly by the secretive @entity30 foreign intelligence unit @entity29			1
earlier monday , sources in @entity0 said two of the suspects ultimately entered the @entity34 after @entity25 's death , confirming a story originally reported by the @entity37			1
but a national security source in the @entity34 cast doubt on that report			2
federal authorities ran the two names -- @entity44 and @entity45 -- through databases and found no indication that anyone with those names or using those names entered the @entity34 after the @entity0 killing , the @entity34 source said			1
the @entity0 sources said the suspect identified as @entity45 , carrying an @entity54 passport , went to @entity55 , @entity56 , immediately after the slaying , then entered the @entity34 on january 21			1
the suspect identified as @entity44 entered the @entity34 on a @entity61 passport on february 14 , the sources said			1
both should have been required to provide fingerprints and a picture upon arrival in @entity34 , the sources said			1
on sunday , @entity0 's police chief said he is " 100 percent sure " that the secretive @entity30 foreign intelligence unit @entity29 is behind @entity25 's death			1
" the @entity29 needs to be ashamed of its actions , " said lt. gen. @entity70			2
" they sent 26 , 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two @entity30 soldiers			1
" @entity9 has said @entity25 was behind the 1989 deaths			2
@entity30 has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement			2
foreign minister @entity82 , however , told @entity83 earlier this month , " there is certainly no reason to think that the @entity29 and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there			1
" @entity82 has also said only " media reports " link @entity30 to the slaying			1
asked about the case saturday by @entity2 's @entity92 , @entity30 defense minister @entity90 repeatedly declined to comment			2
earlier sunday , police said toxicology results showed that @entity95 was injected with succinylcholine , a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic , before he was suffocated			0
signs indicated that @entity95 resisted as he was being suffocated , police said			0
family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow			0
authorities have also said the killers left some of @entity95 's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural			2
but " the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing , " @entity70 said sunday			0
however , authorities have recovered evidence including @entity122 , he said			0
" the dna evidence is quite important and will help us with the investigation			0
" the 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to @entity0 for the killing , then scattered to several far - flung locations afterward			1
@entity70 said sunday not all the suspects have fraudulent passports -- " we know some of the names are real			0
" the total of 27 does not include two @entity134 previously arrested in @entity135 and returned to @entity0			0
@entity70 said one is not believed to be directly involved in @entity25 's death , but " he is wanted by one of the @entity134 factions in the @entity134 territories and he is sentenced to death and that 's why we will extradite him			0
" he declined to discuss anything about the other @entity134			0
twelve of the suspects used @entity61 passports , police said			0
six suspects used @entity54 passports , four used @entity153 passports , three used @entity17 and one used a @entity156 passport			0
also monday , the sources said the @entity1 central bank is working with other nations to track funding and 14 credit cards -- issued mostly by a @entity34 bank -- used by the suspects in different places , including the @entity34			1
@entity2 's @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

27th person added to list of suspects in killing of @entity9 leader in @entity0 hotel
@entity0 police chief " 100 percent " sure @entity30 intel unit is behind @entity9 slaying
@entity30 says only media reports link it to killing and there 's no reason to blame @entity29
sources : two of the suspects ultimately entered the @entity34 after death
