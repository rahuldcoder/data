president @entity0 says he 's postponing executive action on immigration until after november 's elections because it would be " more sustainable " then			1
speaking to @entity5 's @entity4 , @entity0 said the immigration debate was affected by concerns over the large number of unaccompanied children from @entity10 flocking to the @entity12 border			1
" the truth of the matter is that the politics did shift mid-summer because of that problem , " he said			0
" what i 'm saying is that i 'm going to act because it 's the right thing for the country , " @entity0 said			2
" but it 's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration , what we 've done on unaccompanied children and why it 's necessary			1
" the decision to postpone means any political repercussions for trying to reform the immigration system by himself would come after the congressional midterm contests			1
@entity0 still " will do something before the end of the year " on the issue , a @entity35 official told @entity36 on saturday			1
people on both sides of the immigration debate criticized the postponement , including pro-immigration reform groups that are impatient for action			1
@entity0 has been weighing executive action on immigration -- including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers -- after congressional action on the issue stalled			1
the options could include expanding a deferred deportation program for children of immigrants			0
but he decided to delay any move to " take this issue away from those who would use it to score points as a kind of grandstanding issue , " the @entity35 official said , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
" it 's too big of an issue to allow it to be used as a tool for people trying to get votes , " the official said			2
" it is n't about votes for any particular candidate ; it 's about dealing with this issue in an environment that avoids the grandstanding we 've seen in the past			0
" another reason to wait : should the @entity83 retain control of the @entity85 in november , @entity82 may feel it necessary " to try a different strategy " and compromise on immigration , the @entity35 official said			1
@entity90 criticizes move @entity82 @entity90 , the former @entity12 senator from @entity92 who is now running for @entity85 from @entity93 , ripped the move , saying it was a cynical ploy to protect @entity0 's fellow @entity83 for the elections			2
after @entity0 threatened to take executive action this summer , republicans pushed back , saying among other things that the president should n't remove @entity100 from the equation			1
some @entity82 lawmakers had suggested holding up a bill funding federal agencies -- thus forcing a government shutdown -- if @entity0 took unilateral action			2
" president @entity0 's decision to delay executive action to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants until after the election is of little comfort to people like myself who believe in the rule of law , " said @entity90 , who faces sen. @entity107 in november			1
house speaker @entity117 said saturday there was " never a ' right ' time " for the president to take action by himself			0
" but the decision to simply delay this deeply controversial and possibly unconstitutional unilateral action until after the election -- instead of abandoning the idea altogether -- smacks of raw politics , " the top @entity35 @entity82 said			1
the @entity126 blasted the @entity82 criticism			0
" the @entity82 , the party that has blocked meaningful comprehensive immigration reform at every turn and sued the president for acting , is now outraged that he has n't taken steps that many in their party deemed impeachable offenses , " the committee said in a statement			2
but pro-immigration reform groups were n't impressed with the delay			1
the website of one group , united we dream , displayed a message saturday that @entity0 " has further cemented his legacy as the @entity146 by delaying the usage of his executive authority to stop the deportation of millions of immigrants			2
" @entity153 of @entity152 said : " the president 's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the @entity158 and immigrant community			0
" the immigration challenge an estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the @entity12 , many of them for years or even decades			0
the @entity0 administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people			2
last year , the @entity85 passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long - term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security			0
the legislation would have required immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government , pay a penalty , learn @entity174 and begin the process of applying for legal status			0
it had the backing of the business community , organized labor and religious organizations			0
however , @entity35 @entity82 refused to consider the @entity85 bill , which @entity0 and @entity83 claim would pass if put to a vote			1
conservatives say the @entity85 plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers , arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with @entity12 citizens for jobs			0
@entity83 want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible , allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship			0
what @entity0 has been considering among the actions that @entity0 was considering as recently as august , according to reform advocates involved in conversations with the @entity35 : an expansion of the @entity205 program			1
it allows immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria			0
so far , some 660,000 young people have taken advantage of the program , according to a report by the nonpartisan @entity217			0
that 's 55 % of the 1.2 million who were immediately eligible			0
advocates said the administration also has been considering expanding the program to cover the parents of @entity12 citizens or all undocumented parents			0
the @entity35 could also decide to cover undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming , or it could expand deportation relief based on how long a person has been living and working in the community			2
while there are many different mechanisms that could be used to provide relief , using the existing program as the template is an attractive alternative because that process has been running since 2012			0
many republicans have called for immigration reform that includes tighter border controls			2
before for august recess , the @entity82 - controlled @entity35 passed a bill that would have prevented @entity0 from granting new deferrals -- or even renewing previously granted ones -- under the @entity205 program			1
the @entity85 has not taken up the bill			0
