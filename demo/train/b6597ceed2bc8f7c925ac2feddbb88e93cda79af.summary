-- the @entity1 has a " winning strategy " to defeat @entity3 , the chairman of the @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity6 in an exclusive interview on wednesday			1
he added that he " ca n't foresee " sending " large ground combat forces into @entity10			1
" gen. @entity11 also touched on his concerns about the spread of the ebola virus and what 's more to come in the coalition battle against murderous @entity18 extremists			2
@entity3 has inched closer to the @entity10 capital @entity20 this week and continued fighting in strategically important @entity21			2
is it possible that @entity3 could gain control of @entity20 ? " i do n't see that happening , " he said			2
" i 'm confident we can assist the @entity10 to keep @entity20 from falling			2
" however , @entity10 forces , some of whom abandoned their posts when @entity3 began its assault on @entity10 , need more training , @entity11 said			1
still , they have " established a fairly formidable defensive perimeter around @entity20 " that @entity11 characterized as " a very thick and deep defense			0
" @entity11 repeated what he said before @entity37 weeks ago , stressing that does n't see a need to put troops on the ground in the fight against @entity3			1
he was firm on the controversial notion that @entity1 troops could once again head back into @entity10 to fight after being involved in a conflict that stretched from 2003 to 2011			2
and yet he also told @entity0 that " war is discovery " and that if the situation evolves to the point where ground troops are necessary , he will evaluate that and make recommendations to president @entity52			1
there are 12 teams of military advisers in @entity10 now , he said			0
@entity11 said the @entity1 got a " significant commitment " from other members of the international coalition to add advisory teams			0
@entity11 said the plan is to set up three bases where the @entity1 and others can train @entity10 security forces who are battling @entity3 on the ground , along with @entity67 fighting forces			1
he then reiterated that " war is discovery , " stressed that @entity3 is a " national security threat " and said that airstrikes alone will not beat @entity3 though they have forced the group to change " the way it 's moving			2
" fighting @entity3 is going to take " patience , " @entity11 said , so it 's critical that the @entity1 and the coalition show progress soon			2
for now , " we 're on the right path			0
" @entity11 also revealed that the international coalition 's operation against @entity3 has a name : " @entity82			1
" the name , to him , means that " we need to be able to be credible and sustainable over time in order to accomplish the mission that we 've been given			0
" ' we gave @entity10 a chance ' the chairman put much of the blame for the growth of @entity3 on the @entity10 government			1
despite airstrikes and international outrage , the terror group is overrunning @entity10 forces and making significant strides in @entity96			0
" we gave @entity10 a chance -- an opportunity , " @entity11 said , talking about the war			1
" they failed to take that opportunity			0
" " the coaching , and teaching , and mentoring , the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of @entity10 that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population , which created an environment in which @entity3 could return and could flourish , " he said , using an alternative acronym for @entity3			1
when asked who in the @entity1 government underestimated @entity3 , @entity11 said : " i think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the @entity10 armed forces had eroded and would n't stand and face @entity3			1
i think we all missed that			0
" @entity11 alarmed about @entity120 months ago the chairman said he has been concerned about @entity120 as a global threat for at least 90 days			1
" i 'm worried about it because we know so little about ( @entity120 ) , " he said , adding that his worry is stoked by seemingly conflicting information about how the virus can be spread			1
the @entity127 has said that the deadly virus , which originated in @entity129 , can be passed only through direct contact with bodily fluids when a person suffering from it exhibits symptoms			0
" if you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room , one will say , ' no there is no way it will ever become airborne , but it could mutate so it could be harder to discover , ' " and another might say something completely different , @entity11 said			0
he said he is alarmed by the @entity144 's warning that @entity120 cases could increase and the virus could mutate			0
" then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem , " he said			0
" i do n't know who is right			0
i do n't want to take that chance , so i am taking it very seriously			0
