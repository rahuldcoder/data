@entity0 , @entity1 -- the " reward " sign being nailed above the convenience store counter takes on a little more meaning here in @entity7 , @entity1			1
at the @entity9 , it 's personal			2
in 1992 , this is where @entity11 , the man whose photo is on the reward poster , gunned down a store clerk			1
he was sent to prison for life , and no one imagined they 'd hear from him again			2
in this small town , south of @entity21 , his picture is back up and people are wondering how someone who committed such a brutal crime could be pardoned by their former gov. @entity26 -- and law enforcement authorities ca n't seem to find @entity28			1
" it 's just an every minute , constant , in the back of your mind , where is he , what is he doing ? " said @entity33 , the sister of @entity34 , the store clerk shot to death by @entity28			1
he 's a cold - blooded murderer to do what he 's done and if he thinks that he may go back to prison , what 's he got to lose ? " she said			2
@entity1 authorities are looking for @entity28			1
he received one of more than 200 pardons issued by @entity26 during his final days in office			1
@entity1 attorney general @entity47 is challenging the validity of the pardons			1
he said @entity28 and three other murderers did not meet the constitutional requirements to be granted a pardon , and he wants to see the men put back in jail to finish their life sentences			1
a @entity57 , @entity1 , judge will hear the case next week			1
in the meantime , she has issued subpoenas , commanding all the men to appear in court , but @entity28 has yet to be found to be served his subpoena			1
he was picked up by his mother on january 8 from the governor 's mansion , where he was a trusty , serving his time			1
he has n't been seen since			2
" he 's avoiding service			2
all of his relatives know , " @entity47 said			2
" we 've been to all of their houses knocking on doors			2
i know he 's gotten the word and he 's trying to run and avoid service , " @entity47 said			2
@entity47 has announced that a reward is being offered for anyone who can help locate @entity28			1
police ca n't arrest him because he has been pardoned , and he has committed no new crimes			2
if he does not comply with a subpoena , a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt , the attorney general 's office said			0
authorities said they believe @entity28 may be in northern @entity1			1
one of the men who worked the murder case in the early 1990s said the latest developments are incredibly troubling			0
" @entity28 already proved he ca n't live in our society , by our rules , " said @entity95			1
" he committed the ultimate act by taking somebody 's life , so , no , he should never be out , " he said			0
champion was a young assistant district attorney working his very first case in the office			0
today , he is the district attorney			0
he was there in court when @entity11 pleaded guilty to murder in the case and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
according to a transcript of @entity28 's confession to police , @entity11 admitted being part of a robbery so he could have " @entity121 money			1
" he entered the convenience store with a friend who shot the clerk , @entity125 , three times			0
@entity34 crawled from around the counter and @entity28 looked at him and shot him twice			1
" i did n't want him to identify me or the other guy , so i shot him twice			0
... i shot him in the head , " @entity11 said in the police confession			1
@entity11 said his share in the robbery was " between 50 and 60 dollars			1
" " when he was shot , and he fell to the ground , they said he was begging for help			0
... you ca n't imagine how that feels , " said @entity33 , @entity34 's sister , as she began to cry			0
" and then for him to shoot him in the head ... to know that he was all alone			0
that 's the worst feeling , to know that you ca n't help someone that you love , " she said			0
@entity147 said he remembers the day well			0
he said he passes the convenience store every day on his way to work and remembers the brutality and cold - bloodedness of the crime			0
he said he never dreamed he 'd see the day that @entity11 walked free			1
" all of the healing that 's done over the last 18 years is all for naught			0
and all of the work that we did , all of the work that law enforcement did on this case , is all for naught			0
why were we there ? " he asked about @entity26 's pardon			0
@entity26 has defended his pardons			2
on friday , he appeared live on @entity2 's " @entity165			0
" he told @entity166 that @entity28 and the others have been rehabilitated			1
" he has no obligation to do anything			0
he 's a free man , " said @entity26			2
but that 's not the kind of thing a sister who lost a brother wants to hear			0
" its just the pain that we have to live with every day and now we 're doing it all over again , " she said			0
kind of like the reward poster			0
no one ever dreamed they 'd need one again .			0
