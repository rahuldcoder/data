a controversial @entity1 article began a heated conversation about rape on college campus after a student the magazine called " @entity7 " described being gang raped at a @entity10 fraternity			1
now some advocates worry where that conversation is headed after the magazine flagged possible flaws in the article			1
" i 've had a lot of our members , especially sexual assault survivors , emailing me , asking if this is going to distract from the broader , bigger problem of sexual assault on campus , " said @entity15 , president of the @entity16 to end @entity17			0
" they 're worried that fallout from one story is going to give people a reason to believe campus sexual assault is n't a real problem or it 's been overhyped			1
" one in five women are sexually assaulted during college , according to a @entity36 task force report issued this summer			2
last month , @entity1 published @entity7 's story , a harrowing retelling of how she was allegedly raped by seven men at a @entity41 party in 2012			1
the article sparked international outrage and placed the @entity10 in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault			2
students protested , and university officials banned @entity51 activities for the semester and vowed change			0
then the @entity53 identified holes in the story			2
also on friday , @entity1 posted an apology on its website			1
editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on @entity7 , nor did the magazine attempt to contact any of the men @entity7 claimed participated in the attack for fear that that could bring retaliation against the college student			1
editors regretted that , the note said			0
the note went a step further , saying : " in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in @entity7 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced			1
" a day later , @entity1 amended that note			2
it removed the reference to trust being misplaced and added this : " these mistakes are on @entity1 , not on @entity7			1
" the magazine offered no explanation for the update			2
victim blaming ? @entity1 has been accused of victim blaming when it said that its trust in @entity7 was " misplaced			1
" on @entity92 's " @entity91 , " writer @entity90 spoke about the peril of focusing blame on @entity7			2
@entity1 's initial apology that said its trust in @entity7 was misplaced " essentially said this is @entity7 's fault but , you know , @entity7 is not a journalist , " @entity90 said			1
" she does n't know the rules of journalism			0
she 's just telling her own story			0
it 's on us to know that you have to trust but verify			0
you have to check the sources			0
you have to figure out with the story is true because if not you end up in a mess like the one we 're in now			0
" @entity15 said that by focusing on the telling of one survivor 's story , it can have the unintended consequence of holding that experience as the " true " rape experience			2
" it can imply to a survivor , ' well , my experience was n't as bad as that one , so maybe i was n't raped , ' " said she said			0
would all of that actually make it less likely survivors might come forward ? " a survivor will see the way this young woman in the @entity1 article is being attacked from all sides -- from the media , from the school , from the @entity51 system -- and think it 's not worth coming forward , " said @entity123 , an @entity124 professor who was an assistant dean at @entity10 from 1998 to 2002			1
he has devoted much of his career researching sexual assault in college and military culture			0
are discrepancies really that ? @entity123 says the " noise " around the @entity1 editors ' apology will probably mean survivors are going to be less willing to share their stories with journalists			1
some advocates feel that keeping those stories in the dark only makes survivors feel more alone and it takes away from the public 's education about preventing and reporting sexual assault			0
as far as perceived discrepancies in @entity7 's story , @entity123 said that could simply be symptom of the trauma she endured			1
" someone who experiences such extreme stress will talk and remember the stress in different ways at different times , through each telling			0
the assumption is that it did n't happen or she 's lying			0
" that is not in line with the way post traumatic stress presents itself , he said			0
@entity10 @entity172 professor @entity171 also worries that the attention paid to the @entity1 story will detract from the bigger picture at the school			1
" there 's a broader desire to make sure that adjudication of rape cases are handled fair , " she told @entity92			2
even after the @entity1 article published , there was more fallout from @entity10 regarding campus sexual assaults			1
associate @entity185 @entity186 , who guides women through their options when they report they 've been assaulted , recently told @entity189 that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault , even when the accused admitted it			0
@entity186 told @entity189 that there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year .			0

@entity1 told story of " @entity7 , " who alleged she was gang raped at @entity10
the magazine published an apology for the story and said it had misplaced trust in @entity7
advocates worry that fallout will mean a distraction from rape on college campuses
