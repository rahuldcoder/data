my parents , @entity2 and @entity3 , met only twice before their wedding 30 years ago in southern @entity6			1
" @entity8 " is a stretch			1
my mother was 21 and had no say in the pairing			2
it was a shock to her when the man who came to see her was my father			2
she did n't understand why her brothers and her father would set her up with a man 11 years older , from a family that was so different from hers			2
he was a city boy , had traveled to and lived in various parts of @entity6			2
he enjoyed cheese puffs , knew how to eat with chopsticks and the names of different types of alcohol			2
she had never ventured too far out of her town of @entity32 , had never heard of these foods and alcohol was an unspeakable word			2
whether it was a desperate match to stop a few town boys from pursuing her , or whether their horoscopes were perfectly aligned , she does n't know			2
but her brother had a great feeling about it , and the match was made			0
they had no choice but to trust that their parents knew what they were doing , and they went with it			1
they were thrown into a relationship , their first and only one , and slowly learned everything about that person -- raw and true -- from the beginning			0
they grew together because it was new and awkward and special for both of them			0
and no matter what came their way -- scraping for dowries , moving countries , a heart attack , the death of a child -- they stayed together and they dealt with it			1
they did n't even know that it could be any other way			0
i think there 's a beauty to that			1
@entity6 parents are n't the best at expressing love , in my experience			1
they do n't think the words are necessary when you support each other for ... well , forever			0
but over the past few years , my parents have individually divulged their fondness for one another to me			1
and maybe because i 'm older now , i catch them looking adoringly at each other in the temple			0
stealing smiles in the kitchen			0
one discreetly stroking the other 's head			1
my father does n't like talking about his feelings , but a year ago , he told me my mother is his favorite person			0
when we tease him about their age difference , he says he likes taking care of her			0
he thinks she 's innocent , has a good heart and deserves to be taken care of			1
my mother says she and my father are 99 % made for each other			0
they are on the same page for all the things that matter			1
they are opposites in many ways			0
she does n't share his love for cricket or @entity115 , and he does n't engage in her discussions of @entity118 literature			1
but they are perfectly complementary			0
often my mother jokes and tells me even if she searches the heavens and @entity122 , she ca n't find a husband as great as hers for me			0
if that is n't love , i do n't know what is .			1
