-- with up to 300 rainy days per year , the @entity1 are n't set to become the next big summer vacation spot			1
but the unscathed landscape , idiosyncratic architecture and a calming simplicity is attracting tourists more than ever			1
situated in the @entity7 in the @entity8 , midway between @entity9 and @entity10 , the 18 islands that make up the @entity1 have 600 miles ( 965 kilometers ) of roads and a population of sheep that significantly outnumbers the people			1
many arrive , just like i did , with a limited knowledge of this remote archipelago			2
travel guides mention the @entity1 only in passing			1
but the islands , a territory of @entity23 with a total area smaller than @entity25 and just 49,000 inhabitants ( and 70,000 sheep ) , are becoming more than a refreshment stop for travelers on their way to @entity10			2
as soon as i arrive , i meet @entity31 , an intern with the local tourist board			2
over one of the most expensive beers in my life ( $ 10 for half a pint ) in a hotel bar in the capital @entity40 , he briefs me on the local must - sees			2
@entity42 is the northernmost village on the main island of @entity45			2
" from there , you 'll see where the @entity10 giants hurled a rope to tow the @entity1 toward their island , " says @entity46			1
mythological creation according to local myth , creatures from @entity10 were so jealous of the raw beauty of the @entity1 that they wanted to have the islands for themselves			1
but two giants that swam during the night across the ocean struggled to move the islands			0
when the sun rose , they turned to stone			0
that 's how @entity66 and @entity67 ( " @entity68 " and " @entity69 " ) , two sea stacks north of @entity72 island , each about 230 feet ( 70 meters ) tall , were created , the legend goes			0
despite the comparatively small size of the @entity1 , distances here appear surprisingly large and public buses run infrequently			1
a camper van brought across via ferry or a rental car hired locally makes traveling the islands much easier			0
driving around the @entity1 is a thrilling experience			1
smooth , often narrow , one - lane roads wind through the @entity84 - like surroundings , making for a perfectly picturesque road trip			0
such is the case with the road to @entity42 -- a patch carved in rock on top of a nearly vertical cliff with narrow passing bays and sheep wandering the roads			0
the road to @entity95 , just few miles south of @entity42 , is less demanding , but equally unforgettable			0
seven miles of gentle bends in a juicy green valley lead to a lonely church overlooking a fjord and surrounded by waterfalls			0
green roofs scattered along these roads are many grass - roofed houses			1
these started life as a pragmatic solution for dwellings ( see gallery ) , but have since become a symbol for the islands			0
houses have been built like this for more than a thousand years , providing protection from rain and thermal insulation			0
long hours of daylight ( though rarely direct sunshine ) in the summer allow for a thorough exploration of the northern @entity1			1
the main islands are connected by underwater tunnels and one bridge : " the only bridge over the @entity8 , " jokes @entity46			0
driving on another otherworldly road from @entity125 , known for its natural harbor in a gorge , it becomes clear that while the @entity1 are a wonder for a fleeting visit , life here is difficult			1
as i await the never - coming dusk of the almost polar day , the beautiful islands start to feel monotonous			0
lack of perspectives , loneliness and remoteness are problems for young @entity1 and many leave to study abroad			1
but not all is bad , say those who return			2
" you have close family and people to help you here , and the environment is very anti-stressful , " says @entity143 , a @entity1 woman from the island of @entity72			1
despite weather so volatile that , according to a local saying , @entity150 could have composed " @entity153 " in one day here , the @entity1 can easily enchant a tourist with their unusual beauty			1
getting there the sole carrier offering regular flights to the only @entity1 airport , @entity157 connects the archipelago mostly with @entity162 and @entity163 in @entity23			2
some flights depart to @entity9 and @entity10			0
in summer there are also rare connections to @entity25 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
a weekly ferry is another option for those willing to endure three days on the typically rough @entity172			2
@entity173 is a @entity175 freelance writer publishing both in @entity175 and in @entity176 .			0

@entity1 have up to 300 rainy days a year , but the landscape gives them special appeal
grass roofs in the @entity1 are the most *conspicuous* element of the local architecture
many young @entity1 leave to study abroad to escape the remoteness of home , but often return
