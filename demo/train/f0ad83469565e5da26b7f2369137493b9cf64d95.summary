-- @entity2 's record breaking run continued saturday with @entity3 crushed 7 - 0 by @entity6 's @entity5 champions who are making @entity9 history every week			1
it was an unprecedented 40th unbeaten league match for last season 's treble winners and @entity2 equaled their own club record of 26 away matches without defeat			1
but more than just mere records , it was a graphic demonstration of their goalscoring potential , with the returning @entity19 at the heart of the attacking prowess			2
the @entity23 international has not played for nearly a month in the @entity9 through a rib injury but in the 21st minute it was his cross which was turned into his own goal by @entity3 defender @entity27			2
@entity29 defender @entity28 doubled the lead six minutes later before @entity19 scored his first of the afternoon before halftime			2
@entity19 supplied the assist for the fourth from @entity33 on the hour and a fine finish from @entity35 made it five			2
@entity19 's second and a @entity37 with the seventh with the last kick of the match wrapped up the rout in front of a stunned capacity crowd at the @entity44			1
@entity3 continue to hover above the drop zone in a disappointing season , but @entity2 have a four point lead over @entity48 , who beat third - placed @entity50 in a crunch match later saturday			1
@entity53 striker @entity52 grabbed the 18th - minute winner after a mistake in the @entity50 defense			1
both sides finished with 10 men with @entity48 losing @entity60 defender @entity59 while @entity50 , who trail @entity2 by 10 points , had @entity61 dismissed for a second yellow card late on			1
fourth placed @entity65 kept up their bid for a @entity68 place with a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity71 , their sixth in a row			0
but it is difficult to see who can stop @entity2 , who last lost in the @entity9 in october 2012 and have scored 39 goals in 15 league games this season under new boss @entity6			2
@entity19 's display will help press his claim for the @entity83 honor , which will be announced next month			0
meanwhile , @entity84 opened their defense of the @entity86 with 4 - 0 win at minnows @entity89			1
a double from @entity90 , flanked by goals from @entity92 and @entity93 , gave the holders a comfortable advantage ahead of the second leg of the last 32 tie			0
@entity98 went four points clear in @entity23 with a 5 - 0 thrashing of lowly @entity101 as @entity102 scored twice and laid on two others			1
it was a good response from @entity98 , who lost their first league game of the season in midweek to @entity108			0
@entity109 can close again to within a point if they beat @entity111 sunday with third placed @entity113 meeting @entity114			0
in @entity116 , @entity115 scored twice to earn @entity117 a 2 - 2 away draw at @entity118			0
he put them ahead in the eighth minute before @entity120 equalized for the home side			0
@entity118 went ahead through @entity122 then @entity115 leveled with a stunning late free kick			0
the sixth draw of the @entity126 league campaign left @entity117 in eighth place ahead of sunday 's games .			0
