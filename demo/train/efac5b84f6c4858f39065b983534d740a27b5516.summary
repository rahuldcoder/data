-- from minibars to pillow menus to 24 - hour butlers , today 's hotels have turned every indulgence and convenience into a standard necessity			1
but this was n't always the case			0
not long ago , those little shampoo bottles that people now love to swipe did n't even exist			0
nor did in - room @entity13 or fingerprint recognition technology			2
oh , the humanity ! thankfully , over the last 100 years some innovative hotels have helped pave the way for these modern accommodation marvels			0
because of their foresight and progressiveness , these ground - breaking properties forever changed the future of the industry , enabling guests to expect -- and demand -- increasingly more			1
@entity27 tree : @entity28 , @entity29 currently celebrating its 125th anniversary , this scenic beachside resort made jaws drop back in december 1904 when it unveiled the world 's first electronically lit , outdoor christmas tree			2
back then , candles were still commonly used to don yuletide trees and electric @entity38 lights were a rarity			0
@entity28 's extravagant holiday display amazed guests at the time and set the stage for the lavish hotel light exhibitions we now see today			2
@entity28 , 1500 @entity46 , @entity28 , @entity47 ; rooms from $ 321 ; +619 435 6611 en - suite bathrooms : the @entity50 , @entity51 renowned for having hosted various members of the royal family throughout the years ( @entity54 even stayed here the night before her wedding to @entity56 ) , the @entity50 is widely considered one of the top luxury hotels on the planet			1
however , when it first opened back in 1910 , what really wowed the travel industry was that each bedroom was fitted with en - suite bathrooms -- something that had never been seen before at any other accommodation property			1
needless to say , the @entity68 's early guests were delighted not to have to queue up for the toilet any longer			2
the @entity50 , @entity71 , @entity51 , @entity72 ; rooms from $ 455 : +44 ( 0 ) 20 7396 9000 in - room radios : @entity75 , @entity76 when this @entity76 property opened back in 1927 , it was the first hotel to provide guest radios in each room , a feature that had never been offered on such a wide scale before			1
to put this in perspective , the radio in the late 1920s was extremely popular among @entity86 and was increasingly becoming a main source for news , entertainment and music -- similar to what the tv and @entity92 would become for later generations			0
it was n't until 1933 that two - thirds of @entity86 would own a radio set at home , so to have one available in one 's hotel room in 1927 was quite a prospect			2

but what truly revolutionized the hospitality industry was its introduction of room service in the early 1930s			0
the novelty of such a convenient 24 - hour service was an instant hit amongst the @entity107 's high - end guests and it was n't long before other properties across the globe begin following suit			1
as a result , lodgers everywhere can now comfortably chow down in their bathrobes without having to do much more than push a button			0
the @entity107 , 301 @entity131 , @entity108 , @entity132 ; rooms from $ 288 ; +212 355 3000 @entity134 : @entity136 @entity135 countless thirsty travelers saved and their wallets thinned -- all thanks to one @entity136 executive and @entity141 , the @entity143 company that invented the refrigerated minibar in the 1960s			0
in 1974 an executive from @entity147 ( closed in 1995 ) was inspired to stock overpriced liquors in all 840 rooms , and lo the loved / hated minibar was globalized			0
the minibar invention was said to have led to a 500 % increase in room - service drink sales and a 5 % boost to the company 's net income that year , according to the @entity157			2
though the @entity136 closed , the company has a presence in @entity135 with the @entity160			0

in - room air - conditioning for warm climate hotels has since become a commonplace comfort			1

prior to 1970 , however , hotel guests would have been out of luck			0
it was n't until the @entity51 at @entity183 opened its doors that lodgers were first introduced to the concept of bathroom amenities such as shampoo			1
and even then , the very first shampoo offerings at the @entity202 @entity183 were plastic little sachets that were difficult to rip open			1
do n't take those handy little hotel bottles for granted again ! @entity51 at @entity183 , @entity205 , @entity51 , @entity72 ; rooms from $ 639 ; +44 ( 20 ) 7499 0888 carbon neutral : @entity208 , @entity209 as the first carbon neutral - certified resort in the world , this high - end , multi award - winning getaway in @entity209 's @entity213 single - handedly introduced the concept of responsible luxury travel to the world in october 2009 , proving that green , eco-friendly accommodation could also be indulgent			1
