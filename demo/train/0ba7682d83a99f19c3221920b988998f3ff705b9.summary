for members of @entity3 , the @entity1 debate is getting personal			1
this week , lawmakers can begin their sign - up process for health care , and a @entity8 survey shows that while most senators and representatives plan to participate in the @entity1 exchanges , a sizable group is walking away from the government - coordinated exchanges and instead getting their healthcare in the private marketplace			1
the chart : who has signed up for @entity1 in @entity3 enrollment for the @entity19 and @entity20 opened monday and ends in early december , forcing lawmakers to make two big decisions : will they personally get coverage through an exchange -- either in @entity27 as part of their workplace or in their home state -- and if they sign on to the exchange as part of their job , will they take the thousands of dollars a year the federal government gives employees to help with premiums ? of the 118 members of @entity3 who responded to @entity8 , the clear majority plan to get coverage on the exchange as members of @entity3 , taking the employer contribution that comes with it			1
but nearly 20 % of those responding indicated they would not go onto the exchanges			0
some , like rep. @entity50 , @entity51 , are on @entity52 ; a few others rely on pension plans from previous jobs			0
related : @entity19 tech expert says @entity57 getting better but many are choosing to stay out of the exchanges , making a politically sensitive decision that removes them from the process @entity3 created			1
most are republicans who see it as a statement about @entity1 and fiscal responsibility			2
" she came to @entity3 to fight @entity1 , not to enroll in it , " wrote a spokesman for rep. @entity67 , @entity68 , who is going directly to the private market for her health care			1
" he feels the taxpayers should n't have to shoulder those personal costs for him , " explained a spokesman for rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , who is also heading into the private markets			0
but it is not just republicans			0
" ( @entity85 ) declined the employer health - coverage ( on the exchange ) as part of his commitment to fiscal responsibility and saving taxpayer money , " reads a statement the office rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , sent @entity8			2
@entity83 will get health coverage through his wife 's plan			2
related : @entity19 officials get earful from @entity97 on @entity1 the politics are tricky			2
if they stay in the exchange , they could be accused of backing @entity1 and taking federal money for their health care			1
but if they leave , they could be accused of not participating in the system @entity3 invented and , as part of the @entity1 , decreed that lawmakers should personally experience			1
several swing - state and closely watched senators have found a possible political middle ground by joining an exchange as individuals , not as members of @entity3			2
under the current system , @entity3 essentially acts as a small business employer on the @entity27 exchange			0
thus , all members of @entity3 who want coverage and federal contribution dollars through their job have to enroll on that one exchange			1
but five senators are instead signing up as individuals through their home state , going through the exchange system but forgoing the federal dollars that would be attached if they signed up with their job in the @entity27 exchange			0
" i want to have the exact same experience and go through the same steps as other @entity134 when it comes to signing up for health care , " wrote sen. @entity130 , @entity131			1
@entity138 senator @entity137 is planning on doing the same in his state , as are fellow democrats @entity141 of @entity143 , @entity144 of @entity145 and @entity147 @entity146 of @entity148			0
no @entity19 members responded that they were moving to their state exchange			0
one rare category of lawmakers consists of those who are signing up as members of @entity3 , going through the @entity27 exchange , but who are nonetheless rejecting or returning the federal dollars that come with it			2
related : ' @entity1 girl ' said she felt bullied the office of rep. @entity158 , @entity159 , told @entity8 , " the congressman will return the federal contribution money to the @entity162			0
" same for sen. @entity163 , @entity164			0
rep. @entity165 , @entity166 , is still deciding exactly where he 'll get his health care , but if he goes with a plan as a member of @entity3 , his office told @entity8 , he will donate to charity the thousands of dollars in premium help from the government			1
still unknown is whether sen. @entity174 , @entity175 , who launched a fiery protest against the federal contributions to congressional health care plans , will take the money			1
his office told @entity8 that he does plan on entering the exchange as a member of @entity3 , but his staff did not respond to our repeated questions about whether he would take the contribution			0
members have until december 9 to decide if they want to get employer - backed coverage as part of their jobs .			0

members of @entity3 will select their health care coverage starting this week
most say they will participate in @entity1 exchanges
but many will *opt* out in *favor* of private plans or other *opt*ions
