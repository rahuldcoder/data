-- the family of @entity2 -- the south @entity4 teen found dead in his high school gym a year ago -- has filed a lawsuit against the funeral home that handled his remains , alleging negligence and fraud			1
the lawsuit revolves around what the owner and employees of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity4 , knew about the state of the young man 's body			0
@entity2 's parents were shocked to learn in june , when they ordered a second autopsy , that the young man 's organs were missing and had been replaced with newspaper			2
an investigation by a state board found that the handling of the body by the funeral home did not violate the law			1
@entity31 , a lawyer for @entity14 and its owner , @entity32 , said his client had not been served as of wednesday and could not comment on something he has not seen			1
in the lawsuit , filed january 31 and amended wednesday , the family alleges that not only did the funeral home mishandle the organs , it disposed of them to thwart an investigation into @entity2 's cause of death			1

it was a fraud intended to mislead and make it difficult to establish the manner and cause of death , the lawsuit alleges			0
the @entity53 has repeatedly stood by its original determination that @entity2 died by accident after getting caught up reaching for his shoe that fell inside a rolled - up gym mat. @entity0 examined the 522 - page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people , including 18 on the day @entity2 's body was found			1
but the disbelieving @entity2 family pushed in court , leading to a judge 's decision may 1 to grant their request to exhume their son 's body for an independent autopsy at their expense			2
it was during that second autopsy that the missing organs were noticed			0
the doctor who carried out that autopsy determined that @entity2 suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues , " consistent with inflicted injury , " challenging the authorities ' ruling that the death was accidental			2
