-- although women the world over have been doing it for centuries , we ca n't really blame a guy for being a guy			2
and this is especially true now that we know that the male and female brains have some profound differences			1
our brains are mostly alike			1
we are the same species , after all			0
but the differences can sometimes make it seem like we are worlds apart			2
the " defend your turf " area -- dorsal premammillary nucleus -- is larger in the male brain and contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males			1
and his amygdala , the alarm system for threats , fear and danger is also larger in men			1
these brain differences make men more alert than women to potential turf threats			1
meanwhile , the " i feel what you feel " part of the brain -- mirror - neuron system -- is larger and more active in the female brain			1
so women can naturally get in sync with others ' emotions by reading facial expressions , interpreting tone of voice and other nonverbal emotional cues			0
perhaps the biggest difference between the male and female brain is that men have a sexual pursuit area that is 2.5 times larger than the one in the female brain			1
not only that , but beginning in their teens , they produce 20 to 25-fold more testosterone than they did during pre-adolescence			2
if testosterone were beer , a 9 - year - old boy would be getting the equivalent of a cup a day			1
but a 15 - year - old would be getting the equivalent of nearly two gallons a day			2
this fuels their sexual engines and makes it impossible for them to stop thinking about female body parts and sex			1
and so begins the ' @entity73 ' all that testosterone drives the " @entity73 " -- that glazed - eye look a man gets when he sees breasts			1
as a woman who was among the ranks of the early feminists , i wish i could say that men can stop themselves from entering this trance			2
but the truth is , they ca n't			0
their visual brain circuits are always on the lookout for fertile mates			2
whether or not they intend to pursue a visual enticement , they have to check out the goods			0
to a man , this is the most natural response in the world , so he 's dismayed by how betrayed his wife or girlfriend feels when she sees him eyeing another woman			1
men look at attractive women the way we look at pretty butterflies			2
they catch the male brain 's attention for a second , but then they flit out of his mind			1
five minutes later , while we 're still fuming , he 's deciding whether he wants ribs or chicken for dinner			2
he asks us , " what 's wrong ? " we say , " nothing			2
" he shrugs and turns on the tv			0
we smolder and fear that he 'll leave us for another woman			0
not surprisingly , the different objectives that men and women have in mating games put us on opposing teams -- at least at first			1
the female brain is driven to seek security and reliability in a potential mate before she has sex			1
but a male brain is fueled to mate and mate again			1
until , that is , he mates for life			0
despite stereotypes to the contrary , the male brain can fall in love just as hard and fast as the female brain , and maybe more so			1
when he meets and sets his sights on capturing " the one , " mating with her becomes his prime directive			0
and when he succeeds , his brain makes an indelible imprint of her			2
lust and love collide and he 's hooked			2
the ' @entity143 ' a man in hot pursuit of a mate does n't even remotely resemble a devoted , doting daddy			2
but that 's what his future holds			2
when his mate becomes pregnant , she 'll emit pheromones that will waft into his nostrils , stimulating his brain to make more of a hormone called prolactin			1
her pheromones will also cause his testosterone production to drop by 30 percent			1
these hormonal changes make him more likely to help with the baby			0
they also change his perceptual circuitry , increasing his ability to hear a baby cry , something many men ca n't do very well before their wives are pregnant			2
and a word to the wise for all the young mothers who are reluctant to let your husbands hold and care for your newborn			0
the more hands - on care a father gives his infant , the more his brain aligns with the role of fatherhood			1
so , hand over the baby			0
his emotions run deep although men have earned the reputation for being more stoic than women , they actually have stronger emotional reactions than we do			0
they just do n't show it very often			0
studies of men 's faces show that the male brain 's initial emotional reaction can be stronger than the female brain 's			1
but within 2.5 seconds , he changes his face to hide the emotion , or even reverse it			0
the repeated practice of hiding his emotions gives men the classic poker face			0
it 's his poker face and his analytical response to personal problems that can put him in the doghouse			0
she 's crying as she talks about what 's wrong with the relationship , and instead of hugging her , his mind is racing to find a way to resolve the problem as soon as possible			0
with practice and because of the way their brains are wired , men use their analytical brain structures , not their emotional ones , to find a solution			1
they enjoy this advantage , but women often take affront to it			0
when you 're telling your husband your problem and he tries to solve it instead of hearing you out , you may think he 's being insensitive			0
but that 's not what 's going on in his brain			1
he 's working to solve the problem so he can relieve your pain as quickly as possible			0
not because he does n't care or does n't want to listen , but because he loves you			0
' @entity234 ' and ' @entity235 ' as men age , the male brain hormones change and the male brain and body goes into the stage of life called andropause			1
the king of male hormones -- testosterone -- goes down and the queen of female hormones -- estrogen -- goes up			1
whether @entity249 is your kids ' hero or the grouch they hate to visit depends a lot on how he handles these hormonal changes			1
for example , if his testosterone levels drop to an abnormally low level , he can feel tired , irritable and even depressed			0
some men in this condition seek hormone replacement therapy and others find relief in exercise , more frequent sex , and spending more time with other people			0
the grandpa that kids ca n't wait to see is the one who 's feeling the effects of the hormone oxytocin , often called the " cuddle hormone			0
" he 's fun and playful and likes to hear what his grandchildren have to say			0
he 's much more patient with your children than he was with you , when you were growing up			0
the love circuits of the mature male brain can be hijacked by his grandkids , even more than they were by his own children			1
the ' @entity280 ' not only is the mature male brain more receptive to closer bonds , but it 's also more sensitive to loneliness			1
nobody thrives when they 're lonely , but it seems to take a major toll on older men			0
sixty percent of divorces in couples over the age of 50 are initiated by women , leaving their husbands shell - shocked and devastated			0
once his wife leaves , unless he makes a point of socializing more with other people , his brain stops getting the social workout it needs to make him feel good about himself			1
if he becomes a loner , his social - approval circuits do n't get activated			0
in brain scan studies of older males researchers have found that the brain 's pleasure and reward areas , the @entity311 and the @entity312 , remain more active in men who are social			1
so do n't begrudge the divorcee or the new widower some socializing and seeking female companionship			0
the bottom line the human brain is the best learning machine on the planet and human beings are capable of making major changes in our lives			0
but there are some things that the male brain and female brain are not likely to change anytime soon			1
and it makes more sense to deal with these brain realities , than to argue with them or ignoring them			0
the best advice i have for women is make peace with the male brain			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity343 .			2

@entity343 : male and female brains mostly alike , but some profound differences exist
men 's sexual pursuit area 2.5 times larger than the one in the female brain , she writes
she says testosterone drives the " @entity73 " -- or a glazed - eye stare at breasts
@entity343 : a wife 's pheromones cause " @entity360 . " later , " @entity249 " or " @entity361 " ?
