he 's still accused of racism and he remains a lightning rod for criticism			2
but in the end , he told @entity0 , there 's only one judge who matters			1
" @entity11 , " @entity1 said in an interview broadcast on @entity0 's " @entity10 " on monday			1
" i know that ultimately , he 's the only judge that i have to answer to			2
" he knows what happened			0
so i 'd leave it up to him			0
" it 's been seven months since a @entity18 jury acquitted @entity1 of second - degree murder and manslaughter charges in @entity22 's death			1
@entity1 thought his life would go back to normal			2
troubles often follow high - profile acquittals " i was hoping for that , " he told @entity26			2

" at the time , attorneys for @entity22 's family called the courtroom apology a self - serving act by a man facing a life prison sentence			1

this time , @entity1 called 911 , to get his side of the story out			2

@entity1 says the whole thing was a misunderstanding -- and that there were never any racial overtones when he signed on to do the event for charity			2
" it was going to be an unknown person and be a smaller event , " he said			0
" if i went out there and got beat up , the charity was still getting paid , " he said			0
" i do n't want to get beat up , but i saw it as an opportunity			0
i never expected it to be , to turn out the way it did			0
" even though his name since the trial has repeatedly made the news , do n't expect @entity1 to comment on current events			1
asked by @entity26 to weigh in on the case of @entity139 , a @entity18 man who killed an @entity141 - @entity75 teen after a dispute over loud music , he said he did n't know enough details			1
" i do n't watch news anymore , " he said			1
" i watch comedy shows , home improvement shows			0
so i 'm not well enough informed to give you exacts			0
" a new hobby during his interview with @entity0 , @entity1 's girlfriend and her young daughter would n't leave his side			1
neither , it seems , will controversy -- thanks , in part , to his new hobby : painting art , and selling it			0

... it provided a tremendous release for me , " he said			0
' they do n't know me ' @entity1 says he still gets death threats			2

" i realize that they do n't know me			0
they know who i was portrayed to be			0
" people who accuse him of being racist , he said , do n't understand that he was raised by @entity196 family members and that some members of his family are black			2
" before the trial , during and after , i 've learned that the majority of people , when they sit down with me one - on - one or with my family , they get a completely different perspective on me , " he said			0
but that does n't change the anger that many people feel about his case , @entity26 told @entity1			1
" this case became a metaphor , an example			0
your face became the face of , ' this is the guy who gets away with killing a black kid , ' " @entity26 said			0
