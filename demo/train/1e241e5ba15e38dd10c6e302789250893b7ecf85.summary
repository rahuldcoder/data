@entity0 -- @entity1 ca n't forget what they did to him			2
though he is standing in the morning sunlight , surrounded by giggling teenagers and chirping birds , his face is twisted by grief			0
@entity10 @entity9 talks to a @entity11 about his country 's violent past			1
he is reliving the moment when he escaped death in the " land of blood and tears			0
" " in 1990 , i was a very small , and i saw so many things , " he said			0
" the war took us away in the forest , and we started running			2
" @entity1 could have easily become just another anonymous victim of war in @entity11			1
at least 200,000 @entity11 were killed in a series of conflicts between 1989 and 2003 that transformed the tiny nation on the west coast of @entity36 into a wasteland			1
but @entity1 found a way to preserve his pain			0
his story was captured on film by a skinny 27 - year - old @entity10 college student who is using an interactive video system mounted on a suv to show others how nations emerging from war can come to terms with their violent past			1
' it really feels like the @entity51 ' @entity9 , a graduate of @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , is a " post-war correspondent			1
" he is part of a school program called @entity57 , or @entity58 , that dispatches people through @entity11 to record the experiences of war victims like @entity1			1
the @entity52 program is n't just concerned with the past ; it 's preparing @entity11 for the future			1
the collected stories will be sent to @entity11 's @entity66 , a group formed to rebuild trust among @entity11 by identifying war crimes and encouraging victims to come forward			1
the commission is holding its final hearing this month and is expected to release its final report soon			0
@entity11 is trying to move away from its violent past			1
it elected @entity74 , @entity36 's first female head of state , as president in 2006			2
and the country 's former notorious warlord , @entity76 , is being tried for war crimes			1
but @entity9 says the country still feels on edge			1
streetlights have bullet holes in them , roads are n't paved or free from bandits , and there 's no electricity in many cities			2
" it really feels like the @entity51 , " @entity9 said			1
" it 's an eerie , surreal feeling to know that this was a war zone five years ago , and people were dying here			1
" now @entity11 are trying to learn how to live again			1
part of that journey begins with listening to one another 's stories			1
that is part of the rationale behind @entity11 's commission : a nation that can confront its violent past will have a better shot at a stable future			1
" it 's necessary for people to talk and share their stories and engage in debate , " @entity104 said			1
the @entity52 professor says @entity57 uses a cartoon character who looks and speaks like a typical @entity11 to show war survivors how they can record their stories on the mobile video system			1
" ultimately , some transformative truths will allow people to see themselves in a new way			0
" ' land of blood and tears ' getting at those truths , though , may require @entity11 to sift through some gruesome memories			2
during its civil wars , various warlords fought for control of the country			2
the war 's savagery turned surreal at times			1
it spawned thousands of child soldiers clutching @entity131 assault rifles			0
it featured soldiers charging into battle wearing blond wigs and amulets that they thought would protect them from bullets			0
and it was propelled by men like gen. @entity140 , a warlord who fought in the nude because he thought it would terrorize his enemies			0
according to @entity145 , war crimes became routine			2
various armed factions engaged in the arbitrary killings of civilians , systematic rape , forced amputations and the abduction of children			0
@entity153 , a journalist who took a tour of the country near the end of its last civil war , said in a @entity160 essay that the psychological damage to @entity11 's war - weary citizens " can not be fathomed			1
" she spoke of the country 's white beaches , marred by corpses sticking out the sand			2
she called @entity11 the " land of blood and tears			2
" @entity9 soon learned that that the war did n't just leave its mark on @entity11 's physical landscape			1
it left its mark on its people			0
at times , he would share a joke with an easy - going @entity11 and learn later that his entire immediate family had been murdered			1
" so many people have lost someone , " he said			0
" no one is unscathed			0
" yet getting @entity11 to share these stories is n't easy , he says			1
many wanted to know whether @entity9 was going to provide them with a job when he arrived with his camera			0
they were n't eager to dredge up painful memories			0
" they 're coming out survival mode , " he said			0
" they have n't had the luxury of sitting back and discussing the war			2
their attitude is more like , what do we have to do right now to not die			0
" the tangled @entity10 - @entity11 relationship violent divisions have been part of @entity11 's history			1
the country was founded in 1847 by freed slaves traveling from @entity10			1
during the 19th century , various groups thought the best solution to slavery was returning freed slaves to @entity36 where they could create colonies			0
but when freed slaves arrived in @entity11 , many recreated the slave - master relationships they experienced in @entity10 , historians say			1
they created a caste system where they were the masters and systematically discriminated against -- and some say enslaved -- the indigenous people of @entity11			2
tribal divisions persist in @entity11 today , @entity9 says			2
he says he saw evidence of these divisions when president @entity217 was elected in november			0
many @entity11 rejoiced but were puzzled when @entity217 's opponent , @entity218 sen. @entity218 , appeared on television to graciously concede the election			1
" a lot of people thought that was amazing , " he said			0
" they said that would never happen in @entity36			0
no one would ever gracefully bow out			0
" perhaps the stories collected by @entity11 's @entity66 will help teach @entity11 how to move forward			1
it did seem to help @entity1 , the war survivor , when he shared his story with @entity9			2
when he speaks about his war experiences , @entity1 is at first so angry at losing his family that he can barely put his thoughts into words			2
the muscular young man waves his hands in frustration as he tries to explain what happened to him			0
@entity1 says he wishes he had a different childhood , where he did n't have hide for survival in the forest while soldiers hunted down his family			0
" in the forest , nothing good i learn , " he yelled			0
then @entity1 begins to talk about the needs of his country and its war survivors			1
his voice calms as @entity9 keeps the camera rolling			0
once , @entity1 may have been a frightened boy who was hunted by strangers			0
at least on this day , however , a stranger was treating him like a human being			0
" just to express yourself to someone who cares and to know that your voice is important is very empowering , " @entity9 said later			0
" if nothing else , just knowing that someone cares is important			0

@entity11 is emerging from 14 - year war that turned country into wasteland
new effort to collect stories from war survivors is under way
@entity11 is still *reeling* from *horrors* of war
@entity10 in @entity11 : ' it 's really feels like the @entity51 '
