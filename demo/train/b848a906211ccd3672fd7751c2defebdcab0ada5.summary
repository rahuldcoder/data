-- the @entity1 assaulted the city of @entity3 on may 25 , murdering 90 people , 30 of them children younger than 10			0
amateur video reveals rows of bodies , adults and children , riddled with bullet holes and filling makeshift morgues			0
earlier , reports from @entity14 described people tortured , doused in gasoline and set on fire , with the death toll including men , women and children			0
the @entity21 announced it is withdrawing its workers in @entity23 , leaving only 50 core workers , and the @entity25 @entity21 has suspended its first aid efforts in @entity27 after repeated attacks on its vehicles and facilities by the @entity32 army			2
civilian residences are shelled with artillery and tanks and bombed from planes , day after day			0
what else would it take for the civilized world to conclude that the line has been crossed and decent people can no longer stand by ? true , the atrocities in @entity32 do not compare in scope to those of the @entity45 ; however , they have one major common element : they are not the work of some gangs , like those in @entity51 ; terrorists , like @entity53 ; or foreign intruders , like the @entity56 @entity55 in @entity57			1
they are the acts of a national government , a government that is systematically using its military to hammer its own people			2
here , there are no difficulties in determining who is involved , and above all , who is in charge			0
the media sticks punctiliously to professional standards and keeps reminding us that this or that report about the last outrage is " unconfirmed			0
" the @entity73 notes that reports on summary executions by @entity32 security forces in @entity14 remain " unconfirmed			2
" although this or that detail may not be verifiable , the @entity32 authorities do not deny that most of the reported barbaric acts have taken place			2
they merely claim that they are dealing with foreign terrorists and are entitled to a free hand			0
@entity86 : what options are left in @entity32 ? the @entity88 and other democracies claim that they are stymied by the @entity92 's refusal to authorize the use " of all means necessary " to stop the carnage , leaving the blood of @entity32 civilians on the hands of @entity97 and @entity98 , who threaten to veto the kind of resolution that legalized the intervention in @entity103			1
but when the @entity107 faced atrocities on a smaller scale in @entity110 and could not gain the @entity92 's blessing , it acted decisively and effectively			1
if the @entity107 were to proceed in @entity32 , countries could point to a unanimous @entity115 resolution known as @entity116 , which states that all governments have a responsibility to protect their own people			1
the resolution warns governments that if they do not discharge this responsibility , they forfeit their right to sovereignty and the international community has not only a right to interfere , but a duty			0
we are told that the rebels include extreme islamists , even @entity53 elements , who are hostile to the @entity107 and may commit atrocities of their own			1
indeed , the rebels lined up against the wall and shot dead several @entity137 loyalists in @entity27 on august 1			0
there is also the fear that rebels might incite a civil war among @entity32 's various ethnic groups , a result that would cost many additional lives			1
our goal should be limited : pressure @entity137 's regime to negotiate with the rebels on major reforms but not to hand them victory			2
we surely do not want to repeat the mistake we made in @entity151 , in which the army and most civil servants were fired and the country plunged into anarchy and lawlessness			0
above all , we must warn the rebels that we shall cease all support for them if they commit atrocities , a step we did not undertake in @entity103 , resulting in some very distressing consequences			2
finally , we are cautioned that the @entity32 military is mightier , better equipped and more able to fight than the @entity103 one was			0
well , it is a year and half since the @entity32 conflict began , and the army so far has been unable to gain an upper hand against disorganized , poorly equipped , untrained rebels			1
it seems obvious that @entity137 's troops are hardly a match for the @entity88 military machine			1
no one in his right mind suggests that the @entity88 should invade @entity32			1
but the @entity88 could bomb the command and control centers of the @entity32 army and , above all , the compound of those who are responsible for the brutal slaughtering of civilians -- @entity137 and his inner circle			1
the goal would be to punish the leaders of this campaign , to stop the slaughtering of civilians , to force those in charge to negotiate a settlement with the rebels and to warn other tyrants who watch @entity32 from the sidelines that they should not believe that they could act with impunity if they were to follow a similar course			1
frankly , it may be too late			0
the rebels might not be ready to deal with the @entity32 regime , even if those who head it are replaced			1
and the regime might collapse and the country plunge into chaos and increased bloodshed at any moment			0
however , if @entity88 and its allies act , it will be clear that there is a limit to our tolerance -- that we will not hide behind the veto of @entity97 and @entity98 and refuse to move when large - scale crimes are committed by a government against its own people			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

@entity219 : @entity32 's government systematically brutalizing its civilians
the @entity107 stands by , he says , hiding behind @entity97 and @entity98 's vetos of @entity92 resolution
the @entity107 stopped atrocities in @entity110 without @entity230 ok and could do so in @entity32 , he says
@entity219 : @entity88 must punish those committing atrocities and get them to talk with rebels
