-- a rare combination of angelic delicacy and extraordinary power , @entity2 's voice has lent reverie and wonder to songs for nearly 50 years			1
this two - @entity10 set , lovingly curated by @entity2 himself , collects 34 examples of his best work , beginning with @entity15 classics such as " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " and moving through solo standouts like his gossamer version of the @entity22 ' " @entity21			1
" it 's a revelation from start to finish			0
one of " the @entity27 's " particular pleasures is its nonchronological sequence ; when a live rendition of " for @entity33 , wherever i may find her " surprisingly emerges between the elegant @entity35 reminiscence of " @entity36 " and @entity2 's duet with @entity38 on the @entity40 ' " @entity39 , " it hits with all its original power			2
two previously unreleased songs , " @entity42 " and " @entity43 , " stand up well in this impressive company			1
finally , " @entity47 " is a masterpiece of subtlety			0
garfunkel is obviously capable of bravura moments , as on @entity51 's " @entity50 , " but he 's a master of restraint			0
this set 's impact , then , results from the numberless graceful choices @entity2 makes as a performer , allowing his voice to serve these evocative songs while letting them serve as vehicles for his peerless voice			2
