" @entity1 " showrunner @entity0 has always been a stickler for detail , but his latest bid for period accuracy is pretty stringent even by his own high standards			2
@entity0 is changing a song used in the upcoming fifth season premiere after critics who received early copies of the episode pointed out an apparent oversight : the track , @entity14 's 1967 tune " @entity17 , " was n't released until six months after the episode takes place			1
the writer - producer will use a different song instead			1
he sent this explanatory note to critics , which also does n't exactly hurt your relationship with the press : " dear journalist : as you know , one of the things i love best about ' @entity1 ' is the passionate response i get from members of the press			2
recently a few of you have mentioned that the song " @entity17 , " used in our season five premiere episode , was not actually released until six months after the episode takes place			1
because of this we have replaced this song with one more suited to the time period and you , along with our audience , will hear it for the first time during our march 25th broadcast			0
although we take license for artistic purposes with the end - title music , we never want the source music to break from the time period we are trying to recreate			0
as someone who has a deep appreciation for details , i want to thank you for bringing this to our attention			0
it 's a privilege to work on a show that generates an ongoing dialog with you and our amazing fans so please -- keep those notes and comments coming ! all the best , @entity0 " depending how much time is covered this season , maybe they can use the song in the fifth season finale instead ? see the full article at @entity70 .			0
