" very busy lately , huh ? " @entity0 greets me one morning on my way to work			0
" what 's going on with this @entity5 guy ? " my friend , who works for a multinational company , had heard chatter about @entity5 and wanted to find out more			2
i was in a rush so i told him quickly about @entity5 , the blind activist from a rural town in @entity12 who has been mistreated for years by local officials , and how he had slipped into the @entity16 embassy in @entity17 creating a diplomatic spat with @entity19			1
many ordinary @entity19 have been in the dark about @entity5 's dramatic escape			1
@entity19 : @entity5 can apply to study in @entity16 on may 2 , six days after @entity5 had slipped into the @entity16 embassy , the state - run @entity23 news agency declared @entity19 was demanding an apology from the @entity16 for giving refuge to a @entity19 citizen " via abnormal means			1
" during a regular press briefing , foreign ministry spokesman @entity30 said the @entity19 side was " strongly dissatisfied with the move			0
" @entity16 officials ' exploring all options ' he added : " what the @entity16 side has done has interfered in the domestic affairs of @entity19 and the @entity19 side will never accept it			2
" but many @entity19 were baffled by @entity0 's protests because they knew very little about @entity5 and his story			1
for days @entity19 censors have blocked online posts that mention @entity5 's name , or words related to the lawyer like " blind			1
" they have also ordered the @entity19 media to stay away from @entity5 's story and have selectively blacked out international reports about @entity5 from networks such as @entity53			1
lawyer , friend : @entity5 wants his rights " who is this person ? " asked netizen @entity57 on @entity58 , one of @entity19 's @entity61 - like social networking sites			1
" we want the real story ! " netizens demanded to know what @entity5 did , why he wanted to go to the @entity16 embassy and how he got there			1
postings on @entity58 are eventually scrubbed , but the few we read show a range of opinions			0
some supported the official line			0
" @entity19 's internal affairs should be solved by @entity19 ourselves , no need to have @entity16 worry about these , " said @entity75			1
" one should not engage in activities incompatible with one 's job , " wrote @entity81			0
" but basic humanitarianism and universal human rights have no borders			0
" @entity16 ' mission impossible ' diplomacy but a post from " @entity91 " was scathingly sarcastic			0
" may i ask the spokesman of the nation of rule of law : what is the legal basis of deleting posts of mr. @entity5 ? " what is the legal basis of putting him on house arrest for years , for beating him up , for harassing his family , for preventing him to get medical treatment , for allowing his daughter to go to school ? " a few netizens were dismissive of @entity5 's move			1
" @entity19 who have grievances towards the government may now go into the embassy and throw themselves into the arms of the @entity114 , " wrote @entity108			2
but for many people , @entity5 had single - handedly hijacked the @entity117 ( @entity118 ) , a two - day meeting that ended friday			0
the @entity118 brings together top officials from both countries , including @entity16 secretary of state @entity122 and her @entity19 counterpart , @entity123			2
they discuss a range of complex bilateral issues , including trade and investment , cross-border crime , military and strategic concerns , as well as global issues like @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134			0
this year 's sed is particularly important , just months away from a presidential election in the @entity16 and a once - in - a - decade change of leadership in @entity19 , when " stability and smooth transition are the watchwords , " according to @entity141 , a corporate strategist and author of " how @entity19 's leaders think "			1
" although the @entity118 dealt with the most sensitive military and security matters , it was largely ignored by the world 's media because of the solitary acts of a blind human rights activist , " @entity141 said			2
the @entity5 story has shone a bright light on @entity19 's repressive practices			1
yet @entity17 is asking for an apology from @entity155			2
" they are likely asking for an apology because it diverts attention from their obvious embarrassment and shows strength in the face of severe @entity16 criticism over human rights , " said @entity141			2
" yet the fact that @entity5 is now contradicting @entity16 officials -- such that , red - faced , they are having to justify their actions in releasing him -- works to reduce @entity19 's embarrassment			1
" this strange turn of events has raised all sorts of unpleasant questions about the way @entity16 officials have handled the affair			0
the @entity178 administration risks accusations that it is kowtowing to a repressive @entity19 government at a time when democratic reform and regime change has taken place across much of the world in the last year			0
@entity155 is also vulnerable to criticism that it is furthering strategic and economic interests in @entity19 to the detriment of @entity16 's broader goal of supporting democracy and freedom overseas			1
@entity19 watchers expect a brief diplomatic standoff			0
@entity16 officials , they say , will continue to criticize " @entity19 human rights " as judged by @entity16 values , and their @entity19 counterparts will continue to condemn " @entity16 interference in @entity19 's internal affairs , " as judged by @entity19 's sense of sovereignty			1
" yet both sides will continue to reach beyond the rhetoric and deal with international stability and economic growth , " said @entity141			0
@entity17 and @entity155 , after all , have resolved serious diplomatic crises in the past two decades			0
these include the @entity208 bombing of the @entity209 in @entity210 in 1999 , and the spy plane collision in 2001			0
during these crises , @entity16 and @entity19 diplomats worked out carefully worded agreements that would allow leeway for each side to " explain " the resolution in terms that would be acceptable to their own people			2
@entity222 's forceful statements about protecting human rights and @entity19 's unequivocal assertions about protecting @entity19 sovereignty illustrate this point			0
observers regard such tough talk as a prerequisite toward a compromise solution , which could see @entity5 seeking further medical treatment in the @entity16 -- a " face - saving " way to allow the blind activist and family to leave @entity19 , as he now says he wishes .			1

many ordinary @entity19 have been in the dark about @entity5 's dramatic escape
the blind activist had escaped house arrest and sought refuge in the @entity16 embassy in @entity17
@entity23 : @entity19 seeking @entity16 apology for giving refuge to a @entity19 citizen " via abnormal means "
*analysts* say both sides may seek a compromise solution that could lead to @entity5 leaving for the @entity16
