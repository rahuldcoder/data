-- it was supposed to be a good week for the @entity2			1
president @entity3 would celebrate the passage of @entity6 reform , and @entity7 would move toward the midterms with some wind at their backs			1
but on a day the president signed the landmark legislation , the narrative from the @entity2 was more contrite than laudatory			1
@entity2 press secretary @entity14 apologized on behalf of the administration for what former @entity17 employee @entity16 had been through this week and that , to his knowledge , no one from the @entity2 ordered her ouster			1
questions about @entity16 dominated the media briefings in a week the administration hoped would be focused on the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system since the @entity25			1
@entity16 was forced to resign because of a misleading video of a speech she delivered at an @entity30 event			2
conservative blogger @entity31 posted a portion of an address she gave in which she spoke of not offering her full support to a white farmer			0
however , it was later determined that her speech , unedited , focused on how the incident changed her outlook and made her realize people should move beyond race			0
the @entity30 retracted its original condemnation of @entity16 's remarks and issued a statement saying it was " snookered by @entity48 " and @entity31			1

" @entity62 , a senior fellow at the @entity63 , said he thinks the administration 's initial reaction was spawned out of fear over how the right - wing media would cover the incident			1
he said administration officials " allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it			2
" " the @entity2 , the administration , the @entity17 , whomever ... allowed themselves to be bullied into doing something without thinking about it , " said @entity62			1
instead of summoning @entity16 , reviewing the speech and asking what happened , the administration failed to knock down the lies and disseminate the truth , he said			0
" if they had done this in ms. @entity16 's case , they would be looking pretty			1
they would have done great legislative work , and they would have scored a @entity89 coup			0
as it turns out , the legislative works gets obscured , " and they are taking a pr - hit , @entity62 said			2
@entity62 said that @entity3 's problems stem from opinions being traded as though they are facts			2
throughout @entity3 's time in office , the administration has done a weak job of quashing rumors , such as claims @entity3 was born in @entity102 , studied at a madrasa and has a forged birth certificate , he said			1
" i think if he is able to articulate an honest reaction to these nonsensical stories , they 'll be exposed for what they are -- nothing			0

@entity14 called the incident " one of those teachable moments " and said that while he was unaware of plans for a broader discussion , he would n't rule it out			0
@entity148 , professor of marketing at @entity149 , said that though the administration should have avoided this situation in the first place , the damage control has been rapid and effective			0
as for a national discussion on race , @entity148 said it 's not an issue the administration is interested in addressing in a high - profile manner right now			1
but , he said , the @entity2 now must balance " the need to cope with emergency distractions versus the desire to stay on course with the longer - term agenda			2
" " obviously the objective is to remove this unscheduled story from media coverage in order to highlight the landmark financial reform legislation , " he said			2
by friday afternoon , @entity3 was trying to get back on message before the weekend			0
in an event added to the president 's schedule friday morning , he tried to remind @entity172 what had been overshadowed during the week			0
