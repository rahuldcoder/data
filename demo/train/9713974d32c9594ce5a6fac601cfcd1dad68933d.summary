@entity0 , @entity1 -- a suspected @entity5 drone strike in @entity1 's tribal region killed six suspected militants on wednesday , intelligence officials told @entity2			1
two @entity1 intelligence officials said the suspected drone fired two missiles on a militant hideout in @entity12 , one of the seven districts of @entity1 's volatile tribal region bordering @entity16			1
the intelligence officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media			1
wednesday 's strike is the first since march 17 , when a drone strike in @entity23 killed 44 people -- most of them civilians , two @entity1 sources said			0
such strikes have inflamed tensions between @entity1 and the @entity5			1
@entity1 has formally asked the @entity5 for an apology for the march 17 strike			1
the @entity5 does not officially acknowledge the @entity31 's secret drone program that targets @entity33 militants , but it is the only country operating in the region with the capability to carry out such strikes			2
a senior @entity1 intelligence official told @entity2 drone strikes carried out by @entity5 -- once widely believed to have the tacit approval and cooperation of @entity1 intelligence -- are now carried out autonomously by the @entity31			1
" it 's unilateral action , " he said			0
the official expressed dismay after wednesday 's strike			0
" what is this ? a message ( from the @entity5 ) that it 's business as usual , irrespective of what we ask of you ? if it is , it 's a crude way of getting your message across , " he said			0
the official added that @entity1 had asked the @entity5 to curtail its drone strikes in remote tribal areas			1
" we are not necessarily saying stop			0
what we are saying is irrespective of tactical games , this is not useful in the long run , " he said			2
" we need a relook and to not be too trigger happy and be selective			0
" the drone strike came just two days after @entity1 's intelligence chief , lt. gen. @entity67 , met with cia director @entity68 at @entity31 headquarters to voice his government 's complaints about @entity31 activities in his country			0
in addition to the aerial attacks , the @entity1 are angered by what they say is the lack of transparency about the number of @entity31 operatives and the extent of @entity5 intelligence activities within their country			1
although the @entity5 - @entity1 relationship has been on rocky ground for some time , it came to a head when @entity31 contractor @entity89 was arrested after killing two @entity1 men in @entity91			0
although the @entity5 said @entity89 was a security officer assigned to protect @entity31 officers , the @entity1 maintained he was actually a spy whom they had been unaware of prior to the shooting incident			0
@entity1 officials insisted this week that the @entity5 give them details about other @entity31 contractors in the country			2
a @entity5 official who is not authorized to speak for attribution said there is a " desire to expand cooperation across a wide range of joint activities with the @entity1 , " but would not elaborate on what steps the @entity5 is taking			1
the official would not talk specifically about the drone strikes , but did say @entity68 made it clear in his meeting with @entity67 that " his fundamental responsibility is to protect the @entity5 people and there will not be a halt to operations that support that objective			1
" the official said the @entity5 has " an obligation " to protect @entity5 troops fighting militants on the @entity16 side of the border			0
" if on the @entity1 side of the border there are bad people planning bad things against our troops , the @entity5 would be remiss if it did n't take steps to thwart those activities , " said the official			2
the official raised the questions : " what do the @entity1 's expect ? if foot soldiers are carrying bombs across the border , do they expect the @entity5 to sit idly by ? " the official said if the @entity1 do n't take action against extremists operating in their territory , than the @entity5 will			1
" @entity1 needs to talk more about what they 're doing and less about what they think the @entity5 is doing , " the official said			2
based on a count by @entity2 's @entity0 bureau , wednesday 's suspected drone strike was the 19th this year , compared with 111 in all of 2010			0
@entity2 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
