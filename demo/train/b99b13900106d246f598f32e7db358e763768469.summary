-- welcome to the brutal realities of @entity4 football @entity2			1
last summer , when arguably @entity7 's most talented youngster was bought by @entity8 for $ 50m , the future looked so bright			1
the newly crowned @entity10 champions made a blistering start to the @entity13 season , with the @entity14 the focal point for @entity8 as they wowed critics and fans alike with some wonderfully inventive football			1
fast forward six months and the 22 - year - old hazard , who earns a reported $ 270,000 a week , was reduced to kicking a ball boy as @entity8 's season took another turn for the worse			1
it had been a frustrating night for @entity2			2
for more than an hour he had tried but failed to get his team @entity8 out of a big hole as the @entity28 team desperately attempted to turn their season round in a cup match against @entity32 side @entity31			1
but when a 17 - year - old ball boy decided it was time to engage in some time wasting -- he lay on the ball after it had gone out of play -- the red mist descended over @entity2 the @entity14 , whose modus operandi as a player is more sumptuous flicks and stepovers than sly skullduggery , aimed a kick at the youngster 's midriff			1
hazard , who had previously never been sent off in his professional career , was red carded by the referee , @entity51 briefly contemplated pressing charges and @entity8 -- not for the first time this season -- were facing a public relations disaster of their own making			2
" the boy put his whole body onto the ball and i was just trying to kick the ball and i think i kicked the ball and not the boy , " @entity2 told the @entity8 website			1
" the ball boy came in the changing room and we had a quick chat and i apologised and the boy apologised as well , and it is over			1
the @entity74 media and social media website @entity71 had already gone into overdrive			0
" @entity87 's fresh shame , " was the verdict of the @entity77 -- a reference to @entity4 football 's continuing ability to attract the wrong headlines -- while @entity83 defender @entity82 tweeted : " i 'm not the authorities but in my eyes it 's a red for all those asking			0
us players do put refs in bad spots at times unfortunately ! " immediately after the sending off , @entity2 did find support -- from @entity8 's official @entity71 account			1
" has football gone mad ? hazard is sent off for kicking the ball under a ball boy attempting to smother the ball rather than return it , " the club wrote on the account , which has over 1.79 million followers			1
however , @entity8 quickly sent a more diplomatic tweet : " apologies for earlier ballboy tweet			2
hazard has now met with the ballboy and has said sorry			0
" if initially @entity2 was condemned for actions , he also won plenty of support , with the ball boy -- reported by the @entity74 media to be the son of millionaire businessman who sits on the @entity31 board -- coming in for plenty of criticism			1
" after reviewing last nights footage , i 've come to the conclusion that the games gone , " tweeted @entity116 midfielder @entity115 , who has nearly two million @entity71 followers			0
" @entity121 aged 17 , time wasting , then rollin round like			0
. they 've been shot			0
he was actually claiming to be best time waster in the world on twitter yesterday ! what 's that all about ? ... hazard only crime is he has n't kicked him hard enough			2
" after the game @entity2 apologized to the 17 - year - old ball boy , who also said sorry to the @entity8 forward , though the @entity14 is likely to be banned for a minimum of three games by the @entity135 for lashing out in the way he did			1
more woe for @entity8 boss @entity139 the ball boy furore is the last thing under pressure @entity8 interim manager @entity139 needs just now			1
hazard 's kick and red card is just the latest in series of setbacks following the club 's exit from the @entity150 and its dismal league form which has seen the @entity28 team fall 11 points off the lead , leaving @entity8 to focus on cup competitions -- the @entity156 and the @entity157			1
the @entity2 incident overshadowed @entity31 's achievement of reaching a first major cup final in its 100 - year history after their 2 - 0 aggregate win over @entity8			1
the @entity32 club , which almost went out of the @entity164 10 years ago , will now face fourth - tier @entity165 in the @entity167 final at @entity168 on february 24			2
" over two legs @entity8 had the ball more than us , " said @entity31 manager @entity169			1
" that is normal , that is @entity8 , but today they did n't really have any good chances			2
we had some good chances			0
" they had to score at least two but to be honest we deserved it			0
they did n't score once in 180 minutes			0
minnow @entity165 in fairytale triumph " what @entity165 has done - there are no words			0
they have beaten three @entity13 teams , it is marvelous			2
if i had a hat on i would take it off			0
" in the @entity13 , @entity189 thrashed @entity190 5 - 1 at @entity191			1
@entity192 scored twice , while @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 were also on target for the @entity197			0
@entity199 's men are now four points off fourth place which holds the coveted prize of @entity150 football			0
in @entity205 , @entity204 booked its place in the last four of the @entity207 , despite being reduced to nine men during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity210			1
leading 2 - 0 from the first leg , @entity204 opened the scoring a minute before the break through @entity214			0
@entity216 's 52nd minute strike brought the home side level before @entity218 and @entity219 were sent off			0
@entity221 's side will play @entity222 or league leader @entity223 in the next round			0
in the night 's other tie , @entity226 cruised past nine - man @entity230 4 - 0 thanks to two goals from @entity232			2
@entity233 inspires @entity204 @entity230 lost defender @entity234 to a straight red card after 26 minutes before @entity236 followed him down the tunnel 40 minutes later			0
@entity205 striker @entity232 fired his side ahead after 36 minutes before @entity239 doubled @entity226 's advantage			0
@entity232 netted his second from the spot before @entity243 completed the rout to set up a last - four clash with either @entity246 or fierce rival @entity247			0
in @entity249 , @entity248 claimed a 2 - 1 win over @entity251 in the first leg of its @entity254 semifinal			1
@entity255 headed home @entity258 ' cross on 13 minutes with @entity259 adding a second			0
@entity251 pulled goal back just before the break when @entity263 latched on to @entity265 's free - kick and fired into the net			2
@entity31 star helps the homeless			2
