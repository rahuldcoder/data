-- a lone blonde woman , wrapped in nothing but a sarong , leads four camels and a little dog across one of the most uninhabitable environments on @entity8			1
startlingly beautiful , with skin roasted a deep chestnut from the desert sun , the petite 26 - year - old in flimsy leather sandals appears the unlikeliest adventurer for a nine - month expedition across the @entity17 outback			1
in 1977 , @entity19 trekked 2,700 kilometers from @entity20 to the @entity21 , armed with little more than a map and a rifle , in a landscape which had destroyed many a hardened explorer before her			1
adventurers are often asked why they push themselves to the human body 's limits			1
" it 's only in hindsight that there 's any psychologizing of it , " @entity29 tells me in between bites of her croissant , at a trendy inner - city @entity35 © on a humid spring morning			1
" at the time it just seemed like a perfectly sensible , good thing to do			1
above all else , it was pleasurable			2
" and in an age of instant communication , where you are never far from a text message , tweet or @entity51 post , perhaps @entity29 has a lesson for us all			2
" i disappeared but i 've never felt so alive , " she says in her soft @entity17 accent			1
making tracks it 's no coincidence these punishing red plains are nicknamed the country 's " dead heart			1
" a place where temperatures can exceed a scorching @entity63 and the nearest town is often hundreds of kilometers away			2
the @entity66 called @entity29 the " desert woman , " and her epic journey caught the attention of @entity71 photographer @entity70 -- who became both her documenter and lover			1
his intimate images of the intrepid young woman -- tenderly feeding her camels , or swimming in a rare watering hole -- helped make it one of the most popular photo essays in the magazine 's history			1
it plunged the girl who grew up on a cattle station in remote @entity88 into the international spotlight -- her outback odyssey became the toast of @entity92			1
@entity29 's book detailing the marathon mission , called " tracks , " has since sold over one million copies , bringing to life the beauty and brutality of a landscape mysterious to many outside @entity17 -- and indeed to the majority of people living in the country 's coastal cities			1
the book has now been turned into a feature film , with actor @entity108 possessing an unnerving resemblance to the real - life desert woman			1
a literary life wearing a crisp white shirt , @entity29 's broad face remains unmarked by a lifetime in the sun. at 63 - years - old , she is still as quietly striking as those images of a fair - haired girl on camel - back staring fiercely into the camera three decades ago			1
how do you follow an expedition of such epic proportions ? in her late 20s , @entity29 moved to a shoe factory in @entity127 's @entity126 , of all places			1
she fell in with a literary circle that included housemate and celebrated author @entity132 , and boyfriend - of - three - years @entity133			2
a nomad at heart , @entity29 lived across the world , shifting like the sands of her impressive landscapes			2
now she 's back in the @entity141 capital to write her memoirs -- about as far away as you can get from her extreme pilgrimages , including two years traveling with nomads in north - west @entity146 in the 1990s			2
pleasure and pain " why not ? " has become @entity29 's enduring response to why she ventured into @entity17 's great unknown in the 1970s an era before			1
where other people might see a vast expanse of arid nothingness , @entity29 saw the desert as a " limitless garden , " a place " teeming with life			2
" it was a desert she traversed without @entity164 trackers and high - tech camping kit			2
learning bush skills from the aboriginal communities she met along the way , @entity29 ate witchetty grubs -- which to the easily - queasy might resemble enormous maggots			2
she quickly learned not to trust her maps in this unchartered landscape , and instead followed animal tracks towards water			1
not bad for the girl who police initially would n't register a rifle to , because they thought they 'd have to go chasing after her when she got lost			2
real - life romance even @entity70 -- the 27 - year - old photographer who spent three months with @entity29 at intermittent points throughout the journey -- was convinced that each time he looked back at her in his rear view mirror , it would be the last			1
" there were herds of wilds animals , crazy people out there , " he says over the phone , the sound of traffic blaring in the background of his native @entity92			2
" her camels could have thrown her , she could have broken a leg , she could have gotten lost			2
it 's the kind of place where if you take the wrong road , after three weeks you come to a fence and find you 're out of water			0
" much is made in the film of the pair 's romantic coupling , but in the searing heat it was a relationship tempered by more complex emotions -- some still raw for @entity70			1
" i was resistant to @entity70 because i felt i 'd sold out to @entity71 , " says @entity29 , who never intended to write about her personal pilgrimage at all			0
" he 's a sweetie , but hopeless in the desert			0
but when you are forced to deal with somebody , you either kill them or you learn tolerance			0
and we 're still very good friends so ... i think it forged a very deep friendship actually			0
" @entity70 has a different take : " it was much more of a romance -- at least on my side -- then it was in the movie			0
" " i was pretty smitten and you can see that in the photographs , " he says of the " intense and fascinating woman who did n't want me there			1
" " she had no idea how beautiful she was			0
several times i developed my pictures and brought them out to show her , thinking i could win her over -- because most women like it when you show them how beautiful they are			0
and i remember being really stunned that the more beautiful my pictures where of her , the more she hated them			0
" she just said : ' i 'm not some god dammed model out here			0
" four - legged family was @entity29 's real adoration for her faithful dog diggity and four camels , a type of ramshackle circus family inching across the desert together ? " the love story of the movie is much more between her and the dog , than her and me , " says @entity70 , chuckling good - naturedly			0
" this little dog was like her protector			0
if there were snakes , if there were intruders ... diggity had her back			0
" but why camels ? " they 're the perfect form of transport , " explains @entity29 matter - of - factly in her book			1
" one sees little by car , and horses would never survive the hardships of desert crossings			0
" this was not about conquering nature , she says , bristling at the suggestion			0
instead , @entity29 wanted to meld into the environment , her skin slowly turning the same reddish brown as the ancient lands she walked			0
" maybe for men it 's a longing to conquer something			0
they conquer the mountain , they conquer something in themselves			0
i never felt that way			0
for me it was more of a merging into , entering into , becoming part of			0
" tough love she 'd see other travelers " hurtling through the desert in a four - wheel drive , with two - wave radios , and iceboxes , and think -- why bother ? " " my procedure across that desert was about getting rid of stuff -- both physically and metaphorically			0
" did that include the memory of her mother 's suicide when she was 11 - years - old , as suggested in the film ? @entity29 sighs , and you get the feeling it 's a diagnosis she 's heard many times before			1
" it kind of seems to say that for a woman to have done anything extraordinary , she has to be a bit strange , or have something to work out , or there has to be some sort of dark thing in her past			1
" i do n't think my mother 's death had much to do with it at all , frankly			0
" myth and memory these days , where even @entity333 astronauts can tweet every step of their missions to millions across the world , @entity29 's slow and deeply personal journey feels all the more rare -- and mysterious			1
" it 's a tale with mythical elements , " she says , her gray eyes revealing the only hint of sun damage on her serene face			0
" if you think of all the enduring stories in the world , they 're of journeys			0
whether it 's @entity352 or @entity353 , there 's always this sense of a quest -- of a person going away to be tested , and coming back			0
" how lucky we are she did			0
