@entity10 , 69 , is the 11th @entity2 literature prize winner born in @entity12			1

" born in 1945 , @entity10 has published some 30 books , mainly novels -- for which he is chiefly known -- but also some children 's books and movie scripts			1
his novels tend to be short , often 130 to 150 pages in length , and written in simple language , @entity20 said , but they are refined and elegant in nature			0
" they are always versions of the same theme -- about memory , about loss , about identity , about seeking , " he said			1
@entity10 , who published his first novel in 1968 , has previously been recognized with some of the most prestigious prizes in @entity5 literature , including the @entity41 in 1978			1

" after each novel , i have the impression that i have cleared it all away , " he told @entity52			0
" but i know i 'll come back over and over again to tiny details , little things that are part of what i am			0
in the end , we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born			0
" sticking with familiar themes , he also made the 1974 movie " @entity83 " with director @entity84 , which was set during the occupation			0
his latest work is the novel " @entity89 , " published this month			0
the @entity2 in literature has been awarded 107 times since 1901			2
