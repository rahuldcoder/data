@entity0 -- following an investigation , @entity3 apologized to @entity5 this week over an august incident in which five @entity5 border guards were killed , the @entity3 @entity2 said			1
the apology , issued tuesday , was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of @entity3 soldier @entity12 , who was captured by the @entity14 group @entity13 more than five years ago			2
however , it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional @entity5 government , as relations between @entity3 and @entity5 have become strained in recent months			1
on august 18 , militants crossed into @entity3 from @entity5 territory to attack @entity3 civilian targets			2
eight @entity3 citizens were killed in the attacks , which @entity3 has said were the work of a jihadist group based in @entity26			0

for security reasons , the ministry said , the results of the probe remain sealed			0

the overture , however , was deemed insufficient by many in @entity5 and days later , angry protesters ransacked the @entity3 embassy in @entity47			0
the entire staff was hastily withdrawn after @entity50 president @entity49 personally intervened with the @entity5 to secure their safe passage , but the sequence of events dealt a blow to @entity3 - @entity5 relations			0
in the wake of the embassy incident , @entity3 prime minister @entity56 said @entity3 would stick to its 1979 peace agreement with @entity5			1
