for @entity4 , at least one element of her parents ' culture was something of an acquired taste			1
@entity7 -- a pungent blend of fermented vegetables and spices -- is a staple of the @entity13 table , and is typically offered amid a series of banchan , or free side dishes that are meant to accompany and complement the main dish			1
but for @entity19 , it was a dish that made her feel removed from the dominant culture , not included			2
" i actually rebelled against my parents by refusing to eat kimchi sometimes , and i 've actually found out that that 's a super common experience among second - generation koreans , " she says			2
" i got made fun of for all the foods i ate , " @entity19 , a second - generation @entity27 , recalls			0
" i did n't want to invite my friends over to my house because my house smelled like kimchi and @entity13 food , and it was really embarrassing for me			1
" bridging generations and cultures , one blistering bowl of bibimbap at a time after her grandmother , the family kimchi maker , passed away , @entity19 found she longed for the taste she once so adamantly rejected in her youth			2
so @entity19 decided to start making her own version , and relied on her experience of working in several top @entity47 restaurants to find the right formula			2
now , @entity19 considers herself a " kimchi missionary " and has turned her craving into a full - fledged commercial operation called simply @entity51			1
@entity54 is the most widely used kimchi vegetable , but as the popularity of fermentation and @entity13 food grows in the @entity60 , makers are experimenting with other leafy vegetables like collard greens as well as @entity64 radishes and @entity66 sprouts			1
commercial production has not always gone perfectly for @entity19 , who once during the development phase had to throw away about 50 jars because she 'd gotten the salt measurements wrong			0
but now that she 's mastered the making ( and offers varieties including white @entity75 , cabbage , cucumber , radish and more ) she still has one hurdle to clear			0
the kid with the stinky lunch " @entity7 has a bad rap out there , " she says			1
" people have tried kimchi for the first time at @entity13 restaurants where they cut costs			1
they do n't have the time to dedicate to make real kimchi -- and it 's pretty untasty			1
" because of the difficulty involved in producing a high - quality product , she saw the perfect opportunity to fill that niche and offer people a perception - altering taste of a misunderstood dish			0
from there , it 's all about letting the average consumer know what @entity104 have known for centuries : nothing else packs the same combination of sour , spice , texture and funk in one package			0
stall confessions : life lessons from my lunch box the author offers these tips for the optimal kimchi experience : -- open jars over or near a sink			0
the contents are under pressure from gas created by fermentation and can rise out of the jar after it 's open			0
-- many kimchi enthusiasts opt to keep a second refrigerator in the garage for kimchi storage , so the funky smells are kept away from the other food and living areas			0
-- kimchi sold in stores may be as fresh as a week - and - a - half old , but the flavors will continue to develop in the jar			0
@entity19 says the flavors of kimchi deepen even more after six months or so			0
-- @entity7 most often accompanies @entity13 food , but also goes well with burgers , tacos , hot dogs or even on eggs for breakfast .			1
