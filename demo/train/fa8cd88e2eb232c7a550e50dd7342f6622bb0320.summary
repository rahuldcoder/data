-- after 14 years , @entity1 has confessed to the @entity2 that @entity3 " probably does need " a new mission statement			1
back in 1999 , @entity3 came up with " ten things we know to be true " that defined the then - little @entity7 start - up			1
so here are some suggested tweaks to make the @entity3 's original mission statement more relevant in 2014			1
ten things we still know to be true			1
original mission : focus on the user and all else will follow tweak : follow the user and all else will come into focus @entity3 , of course , relies on knowing everything about its user to make money			1
its " free " service is n't really free for us , since @entity3 has become the preeminent " big data " company , mining our personal information to sell advertising			1
indeed , as former @entity3 ceo @entity28 boasted , @entity3 follows us so closely that it not only knows where we 've been , but also where we are going			2
original mission : it 's best to do one thing really , really well tweak : it 's best to do many , many things really , really well @entity3 started as just another search engine			1
but today , the $ 372 billion leviathan , one of the world 's three most valuable companies , not only dominates the world 's advertising industry , but is also increasingly powerful in the publishing , movie , automotive , education and mapping industries			0
@entity3 does many , many things really , really well			2
so well , indeed , that the company has grabbed the attention of anti-trust regulators in @entity52 and @entity53			0
original mission : fast is better than slow tweak : fast is worse than slow as the @entity58 critic @entity57 famously asked : " @entity59 ? " in his 2011 @entity62 nominated best - seller , @entity60 , @entity57 concluded that yes , @entity3 is indeed making us stupid			1
it is shortening our attention spans and making us more and more reliant on links			0
through @entity58 companies like @entity3 , @entity57 says , we have become information skimmers , snacking continually on unedifying links and other superficial content			2
original mission : democracy on the web works tweak : democracy on the web does n't work last week , @entity77 spy chief @entity76 said that terrorist groups like @entity79 are exploiting the web to successfully peddle their radically anti-democratic message			0
describing social media as " a terrorist 's command - and - control network of choice , " @entity76 warned that unless companies like @entity3 actively cooperate with security services , the web will become an increasingly effective bastion for anti-democratic forces and messages			1
original mission : you do n't need to be at your desk to need an answer tweak : you do n't need to be at your desk or in your car or at a @entity97 © or in bed to need an answer @entity3 , of course , now has many , many more ways of following users than its traditional search engine			1
from @entity107 to @entity3 self - driving cars , the view from the @entity106 is increasingly ubiquitous			2
wherever we are , @entity3 is coming up with devices to track our behavior			2
the desk is so 1999			0
today , @entity3 is transforming the whole world into a desktop environment where all our movements and thoughts can be tracked and analyzed wherever we are -- from our cars to our bedrooms			2
original mission : you can make money without doing evil tweak : you can make a lot of money without doing good okay			0
so @entity3 is n't any more evil than @entity125 , @entity126 or @entity127			0
but it is n't morally better either			0
@entity3 was founded on the hubristic notion that one could simultaneously become very rich and do good			0
but this , of course , is the ultimate @entity7 conceit			0
ten years on from its original mission statement , @entity3 has emerged as one of the most powerful and profitable multinational corporations in the world			1
its mission is making money for its shareholders , not improving the world			0
rather than a public service , @entity3 is -- with @entity141 -- the most successful for - profit company in today 's global capitalist system			1
original mission : there 's always more information out there tweak : there 's always more and more information out there see # 5 8			0
original mission : the need for information crosses all borders tweak : the need for information crosses all borders ( except @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 ) for a mixture of idealistic and self - interested reasons , @entity3 has branded itself as the information platform for the world			1
but , of course , the world is n't a @entity165 - style high school project and countries like @entity156 , @entity155 and @entity157 are increasingly making it hard for its citizens to use @entity3			1
indeed , this is @entity3 's greatest challenge in its second decade : how to compete against state - supported search companies like @entity171 and @entity172			1
original mission : you can be serious without a suit tweak : you can be serious with a suit one of @entity3 's most remarkable accomplishments over the last 14 years has been to disrupt traditional corporate culture			1
disruption now is business orthodoxy			1
everyone -- from @entity182 to @entity183 -- wants to " do a @entity3 " and disrupt entire industries			0
the @entity3 way -- of encouraging play and creativity -- has become the new corporate conformity			2
if you want to rebel these days : wear a suit			0
everyone else is trying to look like @entity1			0
original mission : @entity194 just is n't good enough tweak : @entity3 just is n't good enough @entity3 was originally conceived as a way of reinventing the world			2
" ultimately , our constant dissatisfaction with the ways things are becomes the driving force behind everything we do , " the company wrote in 1999			0
but today , @entity3 has become the standard operating system for the world - the way things are			2
its real challenge over the next 14 years is to convince its billions of users that we can trust a company that relies on mining our personal data for its massive profits			1
currently , @entity3 just is n't good enough			0
let 's hope by 2029 , this will have changed .			0

@entity3 's @entity1 admits @entity3 " probably does need " a new mission statement
@entity219 suggests tweaking the internet *behemoth* 's " ten things we know to be true "
@entity219 : @entity3 - style disruption of traditional corporate culture is now business orthodoxy
" can we trust a company that relies on mining our personal data for its massive profits ? "
