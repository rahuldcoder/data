@entity0 -- the murky abduction account of an @entity3 -- who no one appeared to even know had gone missing in @entity6 until he resurfaced -- is raising questions about everything from his name to the circumstances surrounding his reported kidnapping			1
the @entity3 @entity13 in @entity0 announced in a statement sunday that @entity15 was in the compound , having been transferred there by @entity18 officials the previous day			1
the statement described @entity15 as a " private citizen " who was in @entity6 " on private business , " and " not an employee or contractor of the @entity3 government			1
" this characterization differs sharply from that offered in a bizarre , pre-taped news conference saturday conducted by members of a @entity30 militia loyal to radical @entity6 cleric @entity31			1
reporters who had been hastily convened for the news conference , which took place outside the heavily fortified @entity35 where the @entity3 embassy is located , learned that the militia was releasing a man they said was @entity3 soldier @entity39			1
one @entity41 lawmaker said that the man had been captured in battle nine months earlier			0
the man , himself , did not identify himself by name though he did say he was a former soldier who was working as a civilian when he was abducted			2
amid @entity46 tensions , @entity6 seeks alternative oil routes a @entity49 official insisted all active duty @entity3 troops have been accounted for and no civilian was recently reported missing , and even the man 's ex-wife said she did n't know he had been kidnapped			1
a @entity3 official , who had knowledge of the man and had seen the video from the @entity60 - linked militia , identified the man as @entity62 -- a former @entity63 soldier who served in @entity6 shortly after the 2003 invasion and later returned as an " entrepreneur			1
" the account by the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the case , is supported by interviews the man gave to an @entity6 television stations in 2010 in which he identified himself as @entity15 and detailed his business ventures			1
during saturday 's news conference , the man was wearing a @entity3 military uniform and accompanied by two members of @entity31 's political party			2
the uniform , which did not feature a rank or a last name , was devoid of unit and combat patches			0
the man said he had been abducted in @entity0 on june 18 , 2011 , by " @entity85 under the direction of @entity87 , " also known as the @entity88			1
while @entity31 had disbanded his notorious @entity63 in 2008 , a small group of hand - picked fighters -- known as the @entity88 -- continued attacks that primarily targeted @entity3 troops , the @entity3 military has said			2
@entity15 said he was held in various locations across the @entity6 capital by @entity88 members			1
" it was explained to me that my release has been for more of humanitarian reasons and that there was no exchange involved , " he said			0
@entity15 also told reporters that he deployed as a soldier to @entity6 in june 2003 and then " moved to a civilian capacity			1
" during the news conference , the lawmakers produced what appeared to be the man 's @entity3 military identification card and @entity3 contractor id card			2
@entity111 , a lawmaker and a member of the @entity113 , said at the news conference that the man had been in captivity for nine months , consistent with the reported june 2011 abduction date			0
@entity119 's party was a middleman between the @entity88 and the @entity18 to facilitate the man 's release , according to @entity111			0
the @entity123 simply said two lawmakers -- @entity125 and @entity126 -- handed over an @entity3 citizen , who was then transferred to the @entity3 embassy			1
@entity129 , the head of @entity31 's @entity131 political bloc , said the man was " captured in battles " but had no further information			0
he called the release a goodwill gesture to the @entity3 people following the withdrawal of @entity3 troops			2
besides the fact the @entity49 says no @entity3 troops are missing in @entity6 , the website of the @entity143 and @entity144 on saturday listed three @entity49 contractors as missing			2
@entity15 was not among them			0
@entity15 's ex-wife , @entity147 , did not immediately return a @entity1 telephone call seeking comment			0
but she told the @entity150 on saturday that she knew he was in @entity6 but had little contact with him and did not know what he was doing			0
" he just disappeared , " she said			0
another @entity3 official with knowledge of @entity15 , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he returned to @entity6 in 2006 as a civilian contractor			1
the official was not authorized to speak to the media			0
sometime after returning to @entity6 , @entity15 moved into private business			1
according to a 2010 interview with @entity163 television station , @entity15 described himself as the chief economic officer of @entity0 - based @entity165 , an investment and financing group also known as the @entity168			2
@entity165 , according to the reports , signed a number of contracts to assist the @entity172 and construction firms to build houses and other buildings			0
as ceo , @entity15 met with some of @entity6 's powerful political players , including former prime minister @entity178			2
photos of the two men and details of a march 2010 meeting in @entity0 were posted online by various business news groups			0
the @entity165 website was unavailable sunday afternoon , and the @entity0 telephone numbers associated with its various online press releases were either disconnected or went unanswered			0
as to @entity15 , by sunday he 'd been provided " all necessary consular services , including a medical check - up and debriefing , " according to the @entity3 embassy			1
diplomats were helping @entity15 " as he considers his plans			0
" " @entity13 reminds all private @entity3 citizens living and working in @entity6 to register with the @entity13 at travel.state.gov and to pay heed to the @entity6 country - specific information , including the current travel warning for @entity6 , " the @entity3 government said in its statement			1
@entity202 reported from @entity0 and @entity203 reported from @entity204 ; journalist @entity205 and @entity1 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
