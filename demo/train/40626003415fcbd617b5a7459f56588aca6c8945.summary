-- in a ruling that could reverberate nationwide , the @entity1 upheld the state 's voucher program , which gives poor and middle class families public funds to help pay for private school tuition , including religious schools			1
@entity9 has the broadest school voucher program available to a range of incomes , critics say , and could set a precedent as other states seek ways to expand such programs			1
supporters say it gives families without financial means more options on where to educate their children			1
however , opponents of the @entity9 program had sued to block it , describing it as unconstitutional and saying it takes money from public schools			1
@entity32 , the vice president of the @entity33 and one of the plaintiffs , said she was " very disappointed in the ruling			0
" unanimous ruling as many as 9,000 students statewide are part of the voucher program and more than 80 % use the funds to go to religious schools , according to @entity32			1
but in its unanimous 5 - 0 ruling , the @entity1 said that was not an issue			0
it said it did not matter that funds had been directed to religious schools as long as the state was not directly funding the education			0
the tuition , the court said , was being funded by the parents who chose to pay it with their vouchers			0
" whether the @entity9 program is wise educational or public policy is not a consideration , " chief justice @entity55 wrote			1
the public funds " do not directly benefit religious schools but rather directly benefit lower - income families with school children			2
" expanding the program unlike other states , @entity9 's program is considered especially extensive because the vouchers are not limited to low - income students in failing schools			1
a family of four with an annual household income of $ 64,000 is eligible for vouchers worth up to $ 4,500 per child , according to the program			0
@entity9 @entity74 gov. @entity74 has pushed to expand the program			1
" i welcome the unanimous decision by the @entity1 to uphold our school choice program , " @entity74 said			2
" i 've long believed that parents should be able to choose where their children go to school regardless of their income			0
" the state senate education committee will hear a @entity85 bill wednesday that calls for expanding the voucher program to include children with special needs and those in military families if their household income is as high as $ 85,000 for a family of four			1
@entity32 calls the timing " interesting , " saying she feels the schools are getting hit twice			0
she believes the @entity1 ruling will sway lawmakers who were undecided on the issue before tuesday 's ruling			0
she is concerned about the future of the public school system and says other districts nationwide that have voucher programs should watch where the dollars are going and sound the alarm quickly when they see the negative fiscal impact as a result of students transferring to private schools			2
a nationwide debate private school tuition vouchers are a hot political issue nationwide			0
they began in @entity115 in 1990 , according to the @entity116 , and were followed by two other voucher plans in @entity118 and @entity119			0
in 2002 , the @entity120 @entity1 upheld a challenge to the voucher program in @entity118 using logic similar to tuesday 's ruling in @entity9			1
courts in @entity126 and @entity127 have also upheld voucher - type laws , according to the @entity129 , a pro-voucher group			0
a voucher case is in appeal to the @entity132 and another one is awaiting ruling at the @entity135			2
she is not a fan of the voucher system , but in her role in the school system , she was named as one of the defendants			2
" as state superintendent , i will follow the court 's ruling and faithfully administer @entity9 's voucher program , " she said			1
" however , i personally believe that public dollars should go to public schools , and i encourage @entity150 to send that message to their representatives in the statehouse			0
