-- clich√© trailers and unimpressed movie reviews aside , " @entity7 " was still expected to perform decently at the box office last weekend , some guessing a gross in the neighborhood of $ 25 million			1
in reality , the predictions were n't far off -- the actual box office gross came in at nearly $ 21 million , which @entity12 editor @entity11 described as a solid opening weekend , if a little on the low side			1
the true surprise , @entity11 said , was @entity17 's " @entity16 " coming out of nowhere and edging past it with an opening weekend gross of $ 22 million			1
" it 's a situation where there 's a movie with no stars aimed at a very specific age group -- teenage boys -- and it beat a movie with two stars , " he said			2
yet , @entity11 added , @entity26 has never been really reliable to open a movie on her own , and she was the bigger star in " @entity28			1
" @entity29 , her co-star , is gaining prominence but does n't have the years of recognition that @entity26 has			2
the actress was nearly inescapable in 2005 as the media tracked her divorce from actor @entity35 , but her thriller " derailed " and romantic comedy " @entity38 " performed modestly at the box office			1
@entity26 then came back with a hit in 2006 with " @entity41 , " co-starring @entity42 , himself riding a wave of popularity from " wedding crashers			2
" that success -- $ 39 million opening weekend and $ 118 million grossed domestically overall -- was immediately followed by " @entity47 , " which grossed $ 36 million its first weekend , and " @entity48 , " which @entity26 starred in along with a number of other @entity51 actors			2
yet 2009 brought the flop " @entity54 , " which grossed $ 8 million when it opened in little more than 1,500 theaters in 2009			0
by all accounts , " @entity7 , " beaten by a movie about middle school kids or not , is a step in the right direction			2
judging from her ups and downs at the box office , she 's been " far too hit or miss " to be a safe bet at the box office , @entity11 said			1
" the moral of the story is that you ca n't bank on her			0
" yet @entity26 's public perception would lead one to believe otherwise , said film critic @entity71			1
" in general , there 's a disconnect between @entity26 's cultural popularity and her movie star popularity , " @entity71 said			1
" there are certain people -- and you could make the case for @entity80 as well -- given how rampant tabloid culture has become who are much more famous for that stuff than they are for the actual movies or tv shows			0
" if anything , said @entity88 's senior movie editor @entity87 , @entity26 's cultural popularity is the reason " @entity7 " got the dollars that it did , despite its current 8 percent fresh rating on @entity94			1
" despite terrible reviews , people still wanted to go , " @entity87 said			2
" @entity26 is still a movie star			1
" @entity26 is one of the top celebrities that @entity88 covers , @entity87 said , and while her press attention may have something to do with her box office draw , @entity87 does n't think it 's the total sum			1
" @entity101 is covered a lot but she does n't have box office power			1
@entity105 , we cover her a fair amount and her movies have a spottier track , " @entity87 said			0
" there 's something about @entity26 -- they love the hair , the body , the clothes and they 've shown that they 're willing to pay money			1
" @entity26 , @entity71 believes , is indeed capable of carrying a movie			2
she just has n't shown it yet			0
" @entity26 has n't proven herself to be a reliable box office draw on her own , but she is a huge star			1
i think people like @entity26 , and if there 's a movie that looks appealing , it 'll do well , " @entity71 said			1
" but , she 's been a bit overrated in the public conscious because of the extracurricular stuff , and that does n't necessarily translate to her wanting to see her trade barbs with @entity29			0
" which , @entity71 adds , is really the more pressing point : " @entity7 " was n't great , and not even the brightest star can mask that			2
" i think she 's chosen poorly for the past few years , " said @entity134 senior editor @entity133			0
" if you look back before that she had ' @entity138 ' and ' @entity41 , ' and her indie at that point was ' @entity140 , ' which was a critical success			0
" " @entity7 , " on the other hand , " seems like a retread of ' @entity143 ' from last year			2
audiences did n't really care , " @entity133 said			0
he added that while " the amount of hype that we get for @entity26 is always going to exceed the amount of box office she 's going to bring , " she 's still one of the @entity148 actresses			1
" she can command an audience , but she has to be in the right vehicle			0
" the other industry reality to consider , @entity12 's @entity11 said , is that none of the a-list actors , save for a few , are consistently opening with huge numbers anymore			0
" i think there 's a misconception that for a movie to open , it has to have major stars -- nothing could be further from the truth , " @entity11 said			0
" if you look at 2009 , some of the biggest hits of the year did n't have major names -- with ' @entity172 , ' character actors opened the movie based on the concept			0
it was the same with ' @entity176 ' and ' @entity177 , ' which is the golden standard of this argument			0
" @entity133 agreed that these days , audiences care more about the content than which actor is headlining			0
" in the ' 80s and ' 90s , there were a dozen stars you could count on to open a movie , " @entity133 said			0
" the days for any actor , male or female , opening a movie based on their name alone are numbered			0

@entity26 's " @entity7 " performed just *shy* of expectations
" @entity16 " took the *no.* 2 spot without any star power
" bounty " received poor reviews ; @entity26 not proving to be a box office draw yet
audiences seem more *interested* in a fresh concept with *unknowns*
