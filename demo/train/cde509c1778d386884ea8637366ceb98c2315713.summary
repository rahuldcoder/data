-- it 's not often supermodels are selected for their social awareness -- unless , of course , you 're flipping a fashion and photography status symbol on its head			1
@entity10 , a tire company best known for outfitting the world 's speediest race cars and superbikes , also has a reputation for publishing calendars featuring stunningly beautiful women in the raciest of poses			1
the formula for 40 years has been simple : start with the world 's top models ( @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 ) , subtract most or all of their clothes , add backdrops from the most scenic locales ( @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ) and multiply it all through the lenses of the best fashion photographers ( @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 )			1
voila ! you have the world 's most sought - after calendar , the @entity42 of pinup collections			1
well , @entity10 has decided to scrap this high - performance model for something more sensible			2
it 's still sexier than a minivan but quite a departure from years past			2
" in tough times , like the one the world is going through ... the idea was to find positive images and transformations in the world , " said @entity48 , executive president of @entity49			2
it 's not that the @entity60 tire maker 's executives have n't heard the adage , " if it ai n't broke ... , " but rather , they decided it was time for a change , dal @entity48 said			0
instead of a fashion photographer , @entity10 brought in @entity66			1
the self - described " street photographer " is renowned for his image of an @entity70 teen in a ragged burgundy scarf , whose peridot eyes peered out from the june 1985 @entity74 cover			0
@entity66 acknowledges he was surprised to get the call but said he was n't daunted because it is n't so dissimilar to the shots he considers his forte			2
" i think a lot of what i do is portraiture , and it did seem to me that could be why they called me , " he said			0
curiosity inspires iconic photographer as for the models , social consciousness was considered more of an , ahem , asset than what might slip out the sides of a string bikini or loosely draped serape			1
@entity96 and @entity97 , for instance , were chosen less for their perfect physiques than for their work to bring health care to the underprivileged			0
@entity104 was n't selected for her hypnotic hazel eyes but for the more than five dozen schools constructed through her @entity107			0
" they 're there not only for their fantastic beauty but also their social commitment , " dal @entity48 explained			2
@entity113 was chosen , he said , because of the economic transformation experienced there over the last 10 years , which by some estimates has lifted as many as 40 million people out of poverty			1
@entity113 : the ' perfect @entity120 stage ' oh , and it does n't hurt that @entity122 is one of the world 's most colorful and soulful destinations -- and a familiar haunt , as @entity10 staged shoots there in 2005 and 2010			1
@entity10 began speaking to @entity66 in february , dal @entity48 said , and the photographer drove around @entity122 before arriving at his blueprint for the project			1
" i wanted @entity113 to be a presence , " @entity66 said			1
" i wanted a sense of the place to be part of the pictures			0
" the shutterbug said he was pleased with the freedom he , the models and staff had to roam the city 's favelas , many of which were considered unsafe for visitors just a few years ago			1
today , there are football / soccer fields and recreational centers under construction in these once - destitute parts of @entity122 's second - largest city			1
@entity152 noted that showing the development in these onetime shanty towns was integral to depicting the social transformation in @entity122			2
" the fact we were able to photograph freely ... demonstrates that some of these places are getting built up , " @entity66 said			2
" that , hopefully , is evident in the work			0
" @entity66 sought to capture the country 's essence , not only through its vivid settings , but also through its people			2
in addition to the philanthropic temptresses , he photographed slices of @entity122 , whether it was @entity170 - born actress @entity169 ´ nia @entity171 , pop singer @entity172 or simply a @entity173 § ade bearing one of @entity113 's elaborate street art installations ( the city actually differentiates between street art and graffiti " tagging , " with the former permissible by law )			1
he also wanted everyday people			0
so where 1995 's calendar featured @entity190 model @entity188 with bare breasts propped atop a metal corset , hands bound at her side , the 2013 shoot brings you images of the @entity195 practicing their dance - based martial art that dates back to 16th - century slaves			1
and where 2010 's calendar pictured @entity122 beauty @entity200 , licking a rooster she clutched by the throat , @entity66 's calendar contains an image of a vegetable vendor with an arresting gaze , her halter - top blending in with the peppers at her produce stand			1
( because we 're intuitive enough to know you 'll be off to hunt for some of these images , we 'll save you the trouble , but be forewarned : as artistic as the photos are , they absolutely and unequivocally are 100 % nsfw			0
) yet the biggest difference between @entity66 's vision and past @entity10 calendars was the clothes			1
that is , the models wore some			0
clothing did n't make them any less beautiful -- " i think they 're still sensuous , and the sexuality comes through , " said @entity66 -- but he was going for a certain elegance in the portraits			2
he wanted to take these top models , who know the cameras and themselves so well and who are so skilled at their craft , and portray them in a natural setting , to " let them be photographed the way they wanted to be photographed , the way they wanted to be seen , " he said			1
he further explained , " these are women that are making a difference in the world			0
let 's photograph them the way they are without it being too dramatized , without it being too campy			0
" and what bespeaks natural and beauty more artfully than @entity122 bombshell @entity251 -- pregnant ? " when i heard she was pregnant , i thought , ' well , great			1
we can work with that			0
' it 's who she is , natural , " @entity66 said			2
" i saw it as a plus			0
i never questioned whether it might be appropriate			0
this is fundamental to life			0
" @entity251 gave birth to her second daughter , @entity265 , in september , but not before @entity66 captured her against a stone wall , lips and belly in full pout , lifting her hair back from her neck			1
though @entity66 has shot fashion models in the past , the bulk of his more - than - 30 - year - deep portfolio focuses on what he calls " conflict journalism " : the ravages of war , refugees ' desperation , a spate of " vanishing cultures , " as he puts it			1
asked if tapping him for the @entity10 shoot was akin to yanking a fish from water , he humbly demurred			2
" i think it 's possible to kind of walk and chew gum at the same time , " he said with a chuckle			0
so , to the question that many are asking after catching wind of the calendar : how does one acquire a copy ? the answer , sadly , is you probably ca n't without dropping some coin			0
back issues of the calendar can be purchased on @entity301 for anywhere from $ 20 to $ 150 , but the auction site , as of thursday afternoon , had only three copies of the 2013 edition			0
they were commanding between $ 600 and $ 1,000 plus shipping			0
@entity10 made only 20,000 of this year 's calendar , and they 're handed out as gifts to @entity10 's clients , certain members of the press and fashion and art societies , dal @entity48 said			1
the @entity10 executive believes this year 's calendar will be embraced , despite its departure from naughty tradition , and he does n't see any backlash to this year 's inclusion of clothing			1
" we do believe that this ( backlash ) is not going to happen , " he said			0
" we do believe many people will say , ' it 's about time			0
' " see more great photography on @entity327			0

for 40 years , @entity10 calendar has featured world 's top models , often nude , in racy poses
this year , instead of fashion shooter , conflict photographer @entity66 was chosen
supermodels still included , but they were selected for social consciousness over curves
@entity122 beauty @entity251 was photographed pregnant , posing against stone wall in @entity113
