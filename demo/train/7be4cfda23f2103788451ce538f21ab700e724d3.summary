@entity0 -- it 's september 11 , 2012			2
and an estimated 1.5 million people are on the streets of @entity6 waving banners " @entity8 -- the next state in @entity10 " and " @entity11			1
" @entity12 are calling for sovereignty from @entity14 and the rule of the conservative @entity16 , led by prime minister @entity17			2
losing 20 % of the economy is the last thing the @entity21 government needs right now			0
but if those calling for independence get their way , that could be exactly what happens when @entity12 go to the polls this weekend			1
@entity8 -- a region in the northeast of @entity29 and home to global brands and tourist attractions including @entity33 and the @entity34 -- represents one fifth of the @entity21 economy			1
the @entity8 issue comes at an inconvenient time for @entity17 's government , which opposes any talk of independence			1
@entity29 , part of the eurozone mainstay , is grappling with unsustainable borrowing costs and a soaring public deficit while trying to placate public anger over a lack of jobs and stringent austerity			2
out of the hardship , regional disputes in northern @entity29 have started to resurface , particularly in @entity8			1
economists at @entity52 say the political turmoil in such a prosperous region could be the catalyst that forces the @entity21 central government into seeking aid from @entity10 's permanent bailout fund , the @entity59			0
as the industrial heartbeat of the eurozone 's fourth largest economy , @entity8 is the most important economic region in @entity29			1
situated on the @entity65 and bordering @entity66 , the area is home to seven million people and made up of four provinces : @entity6 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
calls for independence the debate over @entity77 independence is not new			1
strained tensions between @entity14 and @entity8 have been around for centuries			1
but @entity80 , sociologist and president of the @entity82 , told @entity1 the vehemence of the debate fluctuates depending on the political and economic zeitgeist			2
@entity87 , head of the @entity77 government , has announced a snap regional election on november 25			1
if his nationalist @entity92 win , a referendum on @entity77 independence is expected to follow shortly after , according to @entity94 , co-head of @entity10 economic research at @entity52			1
@entity80 told @entity1 that a victory for @entity97 and @entity92 should be considered a certainty			1
he said : " the socialist party in @entity8 is in disarray			1
he [ @entity97 ] knows that he 'll win hands down			0
" however , @entity102 , a professor in economics at @entity104 , says that @entity97 is simply " following the crowd " on calls for sovereignty			2
he said : " up until september 11 his strategy was to go to @entity14 and ask for a better financial deal or " fiscal pact " as he called it			0
i guess that the massive demonstrations convinced him that his people no longer want a better financial deal from @entity29			0
and he joined the bandwagon ... @entity97 does n't lead			0
" @entity8 's nearby regions , the @entity123 country , and @entity124 in the @entity125 of @entity29 also have self - governance mandates under the @entity127			1
and while not wholly independent from @entity21 state law , they are still considered autonomous			0
on october 21 , both the @entity123 country and @entity124 held regional elections			0
@entity17 received a boost in his home region of @entity124 where his centre - right party won a majority of the parliamentary seats against two nationalist groups and a socialist party			2
the win represented support for @entity17 's government as it tries to reduce @entity29 's deficit through a rigorous austerity program			0
the @entity123 elections presented a very different outcome			0
the nationalist party -- known as @entity147 [ @entity147 ] won 27 seats while the pro-independence party , @entity149 , secured 21 and @entity17 's @entity16 won just 10 seats of the 75			0
for over 50 years , the @entity123 region was home to a paramilitary group known by the acronym " @entity155 " and in @entity156 " @entity155			0
" the terrorist group -- formed in 1958 -- carried out a number of attacks on @entity21 citizens in the name of sovereignty and but declared a permanent cease - fire last year			1
@entity80 says their activities failed to help the @entity123 's cause and he would like to see @entity77 independence achieved peacefully			0
he told @entity1 : " i believe full sovereignty for @entity8 is absolutely possible and we can achieve this in a civilized manner , without the use of terrorist groups			1
" @entity29 's austerity drive today , @entity29 is suffering			0
the @entity14 - based @entity16 is introducing deeply unpopular policies			0
these include a fiscal cocktail of severe budget cuts and rising taxes on a population already afflicted by the highest rate of unemployment in @entity10 at 25.1 % , according to @entity183 figures			0
the @entity92 is raising the debate on sovereignty at a time of public frustration over taxes in @entity8			1
@entity94 said in a note that the @entity92 blames the central government for disproportionate taxes levied at @entity12 -- with the wealth then re-distributed to @entity29 's poorer regions			1
@entity80 says he understands the need for @entity21 solidarity and to help struggling regions , but says a large proportion of the revenue generated from taxes is not being reinvested in @entity8			1
he added : " @entity12 are fed up with the current situation on taxes			0
@entity8 gets back only about 19 % to 21 % of our contribution to the central government			1
" according to @entity102 , taxes and regional distribution of wealth are a large part of the problem for @entity12 -- but the biggest tensions are steeped in the country 's modern history			1
@entity8 's past after the country 's military dictator , @entity214 , died in 1975 , @entity77 thought that they could be part of a country that recognized its different cultures , languages and nations , @entity102 said			1
initially , that looked possible			0
but then : " in 1981 , after the military coup attempt , the monster woke up , " the @entity104 professor added			0
" all the @entity21 institutions reinterpreted the constitution in ways that did not allow @entity8 to feel comfortable within that country			2
" in 2010 , the @entity21 constitutional courts ruled that although the term " nation " could be applied to @entity8 , the description had no legal validity			2
the recession and financial crisis of 2008 then exacerbated the tensions between @entity8 and @entity14 , @entity102 said			2
this forced the @entity77 administration to make a plea to the central government in @entity14 for a regional bailout of five billion euros from an 18 billion euro credit line set up for debt - ridden @entity21 regions			0
employment in @entity8 is also causing a political headache for the @entity92 and the national governing @entity16			1
according to a report by the @entity250 [ @entity251 ] , unemployment in @entity8 has jumped by 8.6 % to 16.3 % , since the collapse of the housing market and the global financial crisis began in 2008			2
@entity80 says the unemployment rate is in part due to immigrants -- largely from @entity29 and @entity258 -- settling in the region			0
the situation has been aggravated by an extended period of low economic growth			0
the @entity77 people are becoming steadily disillusioned with the economic management from @entity14 , says @entity102			0
he said : " if @entity29 came back today with an offer to solve the financial problems , most @entity12 would still like to be given the right to vote for independence			2
