@entity1 , @entity0 -- on the court they have unparalleled balance , grace and power			0
unfortunately , for too many @entity11 stars , life away from the game can be a far trickier proposition			1
on target : @entity14 was one of the stars on the program			1
this can be particularly the case when it comes to money , despite the stratospheric salaries on offer , currently averaging more than $ 5 million a year , higher than in any other @entity24 sport			2
some players , it seems , are as adept at signing checks as they are shooting hoops			2
a report earlier this year cited an internal @entity32 ( @entity31 ) study as showing that more than half ex-basketball pros are broke within five years of retirement , many struggling to maintain expensive lifestyles without the regular salary payments to match			0
but now one business school hopes to help at least some of the current crop of @entity11 stars become as business savvy as they are athletic			1
@entity43 - based @entity42 's @entity41 has just hosted its first intake of basketball stars for a four - day executive education program covering topics including business leadership , negotiations , brand building and investing			1
jointly developed by the @entity31 , the scheme follows a similar program , run for several years by @entity41 and several other schools , which teach business skills to @entity57 stars ( covered previously on @entity58 )			1
while their team mates enjoyed some downtime in the summer off season -- or at least those who were n't winning the men 's @entity68 basketball gold in @entity70 -- players including @entity60 of the @entity61 , @entity14 of the @entity62 and @entity63 of the @entity64 headed to the classroom for sessions with some of @entity41 's top professors			2
" it sounds kind of boring , but it 's really not , " @entity60 said afterward			0
" there 's a lot of interaction and discussion			0
" " as pro athletes , we 're approached all the time with people saying , ' you can do this or that , just give me the money			0
' now maybe we 'll be a little better equipped to handle the situation , to know whether the person is serious or not , or whether they have really thought it through to see if it really makes sense			0
" mindful of the fact that the average professional basketball career lasts less than five years , the program is intended to both make the most of their earnings while they play and also consider what they might to subsequently			0
" we realize that business education is helpful in preparing a person for a career move , especially for professional athletes , " said @entity100 , professor of entrepreneurship at the school , who devised the syllabus , adding that the course does not " dumb anything down " for the sports stars			1
" the program is optional for these @entity11 players , so their commitment level is high and they want to learn these business principles			1
" @entity100 now hopes to devise similar programs for other pro sports players in hockey , auto racing and other fields .			0

new business school program teaches business to @entity11 stars
