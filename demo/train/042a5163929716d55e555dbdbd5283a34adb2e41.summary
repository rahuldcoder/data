-- despite reports this week of a return to normalcy on the @entity7 street , the situation on the ground is anything but : protests continue while statements from the nation 's leaders have served only to maintain or even stoke the tinderbox status of negotiations			1
demonstrations , which @entity16 says have killed more than 300 people , continued for a 16th day in @entity20 's @entity19			2
" nothing will make this regime go unless we keep on coming and keep on coming , " said @entity21 , a protester there who did not give her last name			0
another group of protesters tried to prevent the army from breaking up a demonstration at the parliament building in @entity20 , and in the northern city of @entity34 , state - run tv reported that @entity7 upset over the distribution of land and houses attacked a governor 's building			1
what the protesters want is simple : the end of a regime that has ruled them sternly for three decades			1
president @entity44 has refused to step down but has reshuffled his cabinet and promised he would not run for re-election			1
vice president @entity47 has said the government will address press freedoms and the release of detainees			2
also , he said on state tv , a committee has been authorized to hammer out constitutional amendments that will permit free , fair and competitive elections			0
the @entity56 , @entity7 's largest opposition group , responded that the concessions fell short and that the government was attempting to divide the opposition with its announcements			1
watch what might be the ' new normal ' in @entity7 " that 's not good enough , " @entity62 , a leader of the @entity56 , said of @entity47 's announcement			1
" the first thing that the regime should do is for the president to leave			0
" the group , which is officially banned in @entity7 because of its religious agenda , has rejected the notion of a religious state , saying it wants to participate in forming a democratic government			2
" we are not seeking power , " said @entity73 of the @entity56 's media office			1
observers say that while @entity44 's ouster is one of the protesters ' key demands , the constitution would need a massive overhaul -- not a few tweaks -- because it is seen as a tool for keeping @entity44 's @entity86 in power			1
@entity89 would also need to be dissolved because the 2010 elections were widely viewed as illegitimate , analysts say			0
anti-government protesters do not trust the process , said @entity93 , an @entity7 - @entity94 protester who feels that @entity47 and @entity44 's promises are " a false act of contrition on behalf of what 's effectively the same government it was two weeks ago			1
" watch another @entity7 - @entity94 's take on the crisis police who had largely stood down when the military hit the streets last week are again arresting and harassing protesters , creating a climate of fear , @entity93 said			2
" i think that this is simply a change of tactics on behalf of the regime , to move from just violence toward the everyday repression that 's been going on for years and years and years , and they 're hoping to just asphyxiate the protests that way , " he said			0
disappointment with @entity47 and @entity44 was also evident in @entity118			1
vice president @entity119 has told his @entity7 counterpart that he wanted to see " immediate , irreversible progress " and said the government should quit beating and harassing journalists , lift the country 's emergency law and bring a wide range of opposition groups into the national dialogue			1
watch why the @entity94 is growing frustrated @entity130 press secretary @entity129 also expressed concern that @entity47 would not rescind the martial law that has given @entity44 sweeping powers for years			1
@entity129 took particular issue with @entity47 's claim that @entity7 was not ready for democracy			0
" i do n't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress , " he said			2
@entity144 , @entity7 's ambassador to the @entity94 , said the emergency decree would be lifted " when it was possible in terms of the security dangers that exist			0
" watch how the reports from media , government do n't always jibe there are now growing concerns that @entity47 is not on the same page as the @entity130 , said @entity155 , a @entity156 expert at the @entity157			2
" up till now , the @entity159 administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition that the @entity7 government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner , so to speak , in this transition , " she said			2
" what @entity47 is offering now is not that at all			0
" as the @entity56 has alleged , there are signs that the opposition groups are splintering			1
most notably , @entity170 , the @entity171 secretary general , who stood with the protesters last week , now says @entity44 should be allowed to stay until his term ends in september			1
read how the @entity56 sees itself participating in democracy " the danger at the moment is that this opposition , which a few days ago seemed to unite , is now being divided , " said @entity20 - based analyst @entity175			1
" the regime is using its tried - and - true tactic of divide and conquer			0
" if nothing else , this week brought the matter of who might lead the opposition into better focus			0
the question was continually raised when the protests first erupted			0
and despite heavy media focus on @entity191 , it 's unclear whether the former @entity193 chief wields the necessary influence			0
now , not only is the @entity56 , which held 88 seats in parliament before boycotting runoff elections last year , saying it wants to participate , but @entity199 executive @entity198 has emerged as a face of the revolution			1
read what @entity198 demanded of ' heroic @entity7 ' snatched off the streets of @entity20 by security forces last month and freed this week , the @entity204 - based marketing executive administered a @entity208 page in honor of slain activist @entity210 , which is credited with kicking off the demonstrations			2
@entity198 has said he does n't agree with the @entity56 's ideologies but described them as " good @entity7 " and said the group is " not as bad and evil " as it has been made out to be			1
@entity198 has shunned assertions that he is a hero and has said he is " ready to die " for change			0
though he has called for @entity44 to be treated with dignity , he has also demanded the dissolution of the president 's party			1
from a makeshift stage in @entity19 on tuesday , his words inspired protesters to began chanting his mantra			2
" this country is our country , and everyone has a right to this country , " he told the crowd			0
" you have a voice in this country			0
this is not the time for conflicting ideas or factions or ideologies			0
this is the time for us to say one thing only : ' @entity7 is above all else			0
' " @entity0 's @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
