@entity0 -- pope @entity4 's butler has been arrested on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to an @entity7 journalist , the @entity2 said saturday			1
@entity8 , 46 , was arrested wednesday for illegal possession of confidential documents , found in his apartment in @entity2 territory , the @entity2 said in a statement issued three days later			1
@entity8 , who has worked as the papal butler since 2006 , is one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff 's private desk			1
his job included handing out rosaries to dignitaries and riding in the front seat of the " popemobile , " a vehicle used for public papal appearances , as seen in many photographs showing @entity8 with the pope			2
last month , the @entity2 gave cardinal @entity28 a " pontifical mandate " to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents that have been released to @entity32 , an @entity7 journalist and author of " @entity34 , " a book that translates to " his holiness " and includes the documents			1
@entity32 would not confirm the identity of his sources , but he told @entity1 that his primary source -- who he referred to as " @entity45 " in his book -- " risked life and limb " if ever found out			0
the source worked inside the @entity2 , according to @entity32 , who refused to give other details such as the source 's gender , age and if he or she was clergy or not			2
@entity32 told @entity1 that he has not been questioned in connection with the arrest			0
the @entity2 called the publication of his book " criminal " when it was released last saturday in @entity7			1
@entity57 and @entity58 booksellers both rank the book no. 1 in sales within @entity7			2
@entity32 's book highlights an internal power struggle within the @entity2 through numerous documents including faxes , personal letters and @entity67 memos			1
he told @entity1 that he received the documents during a year of private meetings in secret locations			0
the documents show that the allegations of corruption and money laundering were a concern for a number of high ranking prelates , including @entity78 , who is now the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity80 @entity78 wrote in a series of letters to the pope that he was concerned about the spread of corruption and that his move to @entity80 would stir speculation			0
" holy father , my transfer at this time would provoke much disorientation and discouragement in those who have believed it was possible to clean up so many situations of corruption and abuse of power that have been rooted in the management of so many departments , " according to his letter which was published in the book			0
the @entity2 has not denied the authenticity of the documents , but instead says the breach of privacy is a criminal act			2
the 108 - acre city - state has its own judicial system , distinct from the @entity7 judicial system			1
@entity1 senior @entity2 analyst @entity113 pointed out that its courts normally prosecute the likes of pickpockets , " not alleged moles			0
" thus , the @entity2 does n't have facilities to incarcerate anyone on a long - term basis and the civil and criminal penalties it typically metes out are limited , @entity113 said saturday			2
he speculated that , for these and other reasons , the @entity2 may ask -- assuming that it determines there is enough evidence against @entity8 -- that any such trial occur within the @entity7 judicial system			1
" the question then would become : does the @entity7 government want to pick that ( trial ) up ? " said @entity113 , a senior correspondent for the @entity128			0
" in addition to being an embarrassing scandal for the @entity2 on its own terms , this also has the potential to become ... a diplomatic contretemps			0
" for now , @entity8 is being held in a special cell within the @entity138 , a walled enclave within @entity0 , according to @entity2 spokesman @entity139			1
@entity139 said the pope was " saddened and shocked " at the arrest			1
the @entity2 said the first phase of its preliminary investigation , under chief prosecutor @entity144 , had now ended			0
an investigating judge , @entity145 , is leading the next stage of the investigation , which could lead to a trial or acquittal			0
@entity8 has appointed two lawyers of his choice to act at the @entity153 , and has had a chance to meet them , the @entity2 statement said			2
" he enjoys all the legal guarantees provided by the criminal code and criminal procedure in force in the @entity138 , " it added .			0

new : given its limited judicial system , the @entity2 may ask @entity7 to handle the case
@entity8 , the pope 's butler , is *suspected* of leaking confidential papers to the media
pope @entity4 is " saddened and shocked " at the arrest , the @entity2 spokesman says
a book based on the documents charts an internal power struggle within the @entity2
