-- @entity1 as a building material is having a real comeback in contemporary @entity5 design			1
bent into minimalistic circular structures and sculptural forms , it is used with surprising results thanks to engineering and technical innovations			2
offering a wealth of aesthetic possibilities , timber is now being hailed as the concrete of @entity17			2
innovative architectural forms in wood was one of the central themes emerging during the @entity22 year in @entity23			1
as the planet is threatened by an ecological crisis , showcasing and promoting new eco-friendly materials was a valuable objective in the @entity22 program -- a topic also extended to the @entity30 at the @entity31			1
as exhibition designer @entity32 points out : " the young generation of architects have taken up wood with an innovative approach , thinking about all its possibilities from a new perspective			0
" in @entity23 , at the @entity42 architecture school , a studio in timber design offers students the possibility for a particular focus			1
a summer pavilion for the @entity22 events was created by a team of students from an initial concept designed by @entity51			1
" as a living material , wood is both challenging and inspiring , " @entity51 says			0
the fact that wood is the most eco-friendly building material is an obvious reason for its use , but as @entity51 explains its aesthetic qualities are being rediscovered and appreciated again			0
in public buildings , such as the @entity62 and @entity63 in @entity64 in @entity65 wooden surfaces have been cleverly used for psychological effects			1
@entity67 from the @entity30 architectural studio @entity68 explains that the concert hall was conceived to feel as a musical instrument in itself			2
the undulating form of the ceiling was built from local oak based on traditional boat construction principles			0
such a formal solution would have been impossible to make out of any other material			0
in a similar way the @entity77 is an example of exquisite craftsmanship in the treatment of timber			1
erected in one of the busiest areas in @entity23 the chapel looks like a giant wooden bowl that has accidentally landed in the heart of the city and feels almost like a piece of conceptual art -- architecture with spiritual and intellectual connotations -- as sacred buildings should , of course			1
its setting is unusual and its circular form radically breaking traditional models of architecture			0
in @entity101 countries and in the @entity102 , wood has always been part of the architectural heritage			1
weekends and holidays are still spent in waterfront log cabins and wooden cottages , but due to safety regulations -- and a disdain towards traditional materials in the 1960 's -- its use diminished in family house building			2
@entity1 has been perceived as a modest material			1
a sense of simplicity and truthfulness is still associated to all timber constructions			0
in a world where our ecological footprint is continuously considered , the reality of wood being the new concrete looks plausible indeed			0
not only does wood absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide , it also stores it in its finished form			0
the entire lifecycle of wood from construction to recycling benefits the planet from an ecological perspective			0
in countries where wood is a natural resource buildings made out of timber make perfect sense			2
" it would be crazy not to make the most of a material , which is renewable and responds to serious environmental threats , " @entity51 says			0
" producing concrete and steel takes huge amounts of energy			0
" he also believes that wooden buildings will attribute to a better society where people are more tolerant and open towards each other : " there is a warmth in wood and i do n't just mean the physical characteristics			1
