-- @entity2 @entity1 announced greater political participation for women in the conservative kingdom this week , but tuesday , a human rights group decried the promised reforms in light of a flogging sentence for a woman who dared to drive a car			1
@entity12 said a @entity2 woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for getting behind the wheel			1
the group said the harsh sentence demonstrated the scale of discrimination against women in the @entity22 nation , and it urged the dismantling of the " whole system of women 's subordination			1
" " @entity30 is a cruel punishment in all circumstances , but it beggars belief that the authorities in @entity2 have imposed lashes on a woman apparently for merely driving a car , " said @entity26 , @entity12 's @entity27 and @entity29 deputy director			1
" belatedly allowing women to vote in council elections is all well and good , but if they are still going to face being flogged for trying to exercise their right to freedom of movement , then the @entity1 's much - trumpeted ' reforms ' actually amount to very little			1
" @entity12 said a court in @entity45 handed down the sentence tuesday			1
two other women are believed to be facing charges for driving , one in @entity45 and one in @entity51			2
the @entity53 campaign said the woman who was sentenced to 10 lashes has appealed the sentence			1
she said she did not want to be identified or speak publicly about her case for her own safety			0
@entity53 also said police pulled over women 's rights activist @entity59 for driving in @entity61 on tuesday			2
she was taken to police headquarters for questioning and released after she signed a pledge not to drive and called for a taxi home , a statement from @entity53 said			0
" after the euphoria of the announcement on voting , we are saddened and shocked to hear the news today , " said @entity67 , a member of @entity53			0
no specific traffic laws make it illegal for women to drive in @entity2 , but religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers			1
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian			2
authorities stopped @entity87 , 32 , for driving a car may 21 and detained her the next day			0
she said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail			2
her case became a rallying cry for female activists			0
the @entity53 campaign on @entity95 and @entity96 encouraged women to drive as part of their normal daily activities rather than converge in one place			2
on sunday , @entity1 announced two changes for women , which would be historic for @entity2			1
he said women will be allowed to serve as members of the @entity105 , the appointed consultative council that advises the king			1
he also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections			2
it is unknown when those may ultimately take place			0
the changes do not apply to elections scheduled for thursday , which will be only the second set of elections in the kingdom since 1963			0
the @entity121 's human rights report on @entity2 , published in 2011 , noted many challenges facing women in @entity2 in 2010 : -- " by law a female rape victim is at fault for illegal ' mixing of genders ' and is punished along with the perpetrator			1
" -- " the guardianship system requires that every woman have a close male relative as her ' guardian ' with the authority to approve her travel			0
" -- " women risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative			0
" -- " women also faced discrimination in courts , where the testimony of one man equals that of two women			0
" -- " the law requires a woman to obtain the permission of a male guardian to work if the type of business is not ' deemed appropriate for a woman			0
' " @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
