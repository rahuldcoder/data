@entity0 -- a federal court panel in @entity0 wednesday ruled in favor of @entity5 's voter photo id law , but said it can not go into effect until next year because there 's too little time to implement the new law for this november 's election			1
the three - judge panel said @entity5 's law does not discriminate against racial minorities as the @entity14 and other opponents had argued			1
the ruling further clouds the issue , which has resulted in conflicting rulings on whether requiring voters to present an identification card bearing the person 's photograph is discriminatory			0
in " pre-clearing key sections of the @entity5 statute , the judges compared the law with those of other states , including @entity29 , where a federal court panel rejected a photo id requirement for voting , " wrote the opinion 's author , d.c. circuit judge @entity23			1
latino voter registration efforts running out of time in @entity36 " in sum , our comparison of @entity5 's act to some other states ' voter id laws ... strongly buttresses the conclusion that @entity5 's law has neither a discriminatory effect nor a discriminatory purpose , " he wrote			1
circuit judges @entity47 and @entity49 joined with concurring opinions			0
the judges said the new law would require voters to be informed of and educated about the law 's requirements , which would not be possible before the november 6 elections			1
therefore , the panel rejected trying to implement the provisions for the upcoming balloting			0
the judges noted that about 95 % of @entity5 registered voters possess the approved photo ids			2
that includes 96 % of whites and 92 % to 94 % of @entity66 voters			0
despite the disparity , the court found that state election officials had included a " sweeping reasonable impediment provision " that eliminates any disproportionate effect or material burden on voters			0
the judges took note of the requirement in the @entity29 law , which has been blocked in court , requiring many citizens to get a birth certificate that costs $ 22			2
and in @entity29 , unlike @entity5 , many counties lack a place for voters to obtain qualifying photo identification cards			2
the court found no comparable issues in the @entity5 law			2
the @entity14 , although on the losing end of the ruling , issued a statement expressing satisfaction with much of the opinion			0
judge blocks @entity36 voter id law for november election " the @entity14 is pleased that the court has denied " preclearance " of the @entity5 law for the 2012 elections , " said @entity14 civil rights spokeswoman @entity94			1
" with regard to future elections , the department welcomes the court 's agreement that @entity5 's law required broad modifications in order to respond to the serious concerns raised by the attorney general that the law as written would exclude minority voters			1
" @entity5 attorney general @entity110 declared victory in the case , calling the ruling " a major victory for @entity5 and its election process			0
" " it affirms our voter id law is valid and constitutional under the @entity119 , " he said			1
" we will work diligently to implement this law for all future elections			0
" @entity122 , @entity123 weigh in on voting rights at @entity0 dinner			0
