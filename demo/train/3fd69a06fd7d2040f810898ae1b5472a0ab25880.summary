" this is not a time for internal fighting , nor for tension , " @entity3 said in the televised speech			0
" any political differences should be resolved through democratic dialogue , not fiery arguments , nor violence , no matter where it stems from			0
" on wednesday , crowds protesting the earlier stabbing death of a popular anti-fascist figure in @entity19 -- allegedly at the hands a @entity5 supporter -- hurled rocks at police and burned trash bins outside their station			1
the clashes came despite police raids of @entity5 offices and the arrest of a 45 - year - old party supporter who police say admitted killing @entity32 , a well - known hip - hop artist with the stage name @entity32 @entity36 ' death inflamed already growing concerns about the rising influence of @entity5 , an ultranationalist , anti-immigration party that has been linked to street violence and neo-nazism			1

@entity0 public order minister @entity66 described the killing as an " abominable murder ... by an attacker who , according to his own statement , sympathizes with @entity5 , thus illustrating in the most obvious way the intentions of @entity42			2
" @entity66 said the government is looking to amend the country 's criminal code to make it easier to prosecute political attacks and better define what constitutes an " armed gang			0
" deputy prime minister @entity80 , whose socialist @entity82 party is part of the governing coalition , said @entity5 " must be dealt with as a criminal organization			1
" and an @entity87 member of the @entity88 , @entity89 , also urged lawmakers to ban the party " @entity5 's openly xenophobic , @entity42 hatred goes as far as murdering political opponents			2
this is shocking and intolerable by any standards , and more so in a @entity98 country , " he said			0
in his speech thursday , @entity3 called @entity57 ' death an " inhuman assassination " and said the government is " determined to not allow the descendants of the @entity103 to poison our social life , to commit crimes , terrorize and undermine the foundations of the country that gave birth to democracy			2
