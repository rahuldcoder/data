-- @entity1 , who died sunday at 93 , may have been the most unusual major star in the history of @entity3			1
why ? for one thing , at the peak of his fame , he was only a youth			0
in the late 1930s into the 1940s when he topped the @entity3 box office , earning the then huge sum of $ 150,000 a year , there were few child actors with his clout			1
in fact , unlike today , there were n't many child actors at all			1
only @entity16 and @entity17 could begin to rival him			0
then there was his size , even into adulthood			0
there were other diminutive stars in @entity3 's @entity24 , such as @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , but no one as pint - sized as @entity30 , who topped out at just 5 - foot - 2			1
we like our stars to be outsized			2
but @entity30 had something else that no other star had			1
male stars -- then as now -- were largely figures of power : not just @entity25 and @entity28 , but @entity38 , @entity39 , even @entity40			1
moviegoers were attracted to their ability to dominate , to bend the world to their will			0
@entity30 did n't exude power			1
@entity30 never played the conventional hero vanquishing forces of evil			1
he was best known as @entity51 in a series of films at @entity54 : the quintessential young man in the quintessential small town with the quintessential family and honoring quintessential @entity59 values			1
about the only things he vanquished in these movies were his own doubts or his own lovesickness or his own moral quandaries			0
@entity51 was eager , loving , decent , thoughtful -- not the qualities we ascribe to movie heroes but the very qualities @entity59 , particularly as they emerged from the @entity70 -- liked to ascribe to themselves			1
he did n't conquer through strength			0
he succeeded through sheer energy			0
" let 's put on a show , " the joking line attributed to @entity30 in those @entity1 - @entity75 pictures , expressed what @entity30 was about : not @entity59 muscle , but @entity59 determination			1
and if @entity30 did n't convey power , he did n't convey manliness either			1
( hell , he was n't even a grown man in his heyday			0
) the great male stars of his time did n't cry			1
they did n't even wince			0
they were stoics patrolling @entity59 's mean streets			1
only @entity89 among them even seemed to have a tender side			0
but @entity30 was no stoic			2
he was open and vulnerable and wounded and occasionally scared			0
think of the last scene in " @entity94 " where he stares into the night after his prisoner father is executed			0
he could n't stare down the world the way the other male stars did			1
he could only stare into it , often with wonder and pain			0
after all , he was still a boy , he could expose his heart			0
and there was one more thing about @entity30 that made him an unusual star in the @entity3 constellation			1
almost every great star then , male and female , was a cynic			0
they were hard - boiled , had learned to survive life , but lived without illusions			0
think of @entity28 in " @entity116 " or " @entity117 " or @entity118 in just about any of her pictures			0
@entity30 , again partly because of his youth , was devoid of that cynicism			2
he was hopeful , idealistic , utterly sincere			2
in a movie world of doubt , @entity30 alone was a true believer			2
in these three ways -- pluck and heart and idealism -- @entity30 may have come closer to the @entity59 ethos in depression - era @entity59 than any other star			1
he was loved not because he expressed what we could only hope to be , but because he expressed what we liked to think we actually were			0
take @entity30 in what is arguably his best role , as @entity139 in @entity141 's screen version of @entity144 's @entity143 novel , " @entity145 , " from 1943			2
@entity139 's job is to deliver telegrams , including those informing families of their sons ' death in battle -- more @entity30 sadness			2
this was @entity54 head @entity156 's favorite film because it captured the idealized way he viewed @entity59 , with @entity30 as the idealized @entity59 boy -- though the director @entity160 once recalled to me a time he found @entity156 throttling @entity30 on the lot after some transgression and yelling , " you 're @entity51 ! you 're @entity59 ! " that @entity30 was			1
his death is a reminder of an earlier time when @entity59 had a more innocent vision of themselves			2
@entity30 's persona may not have worn well over time -- it was a young man 's persona -- but in the ' 30s and ' 40s he was the personification of that innocence , and a vestige of it has passed with him .			2

@entity181 : @entity30 was very unusual in @entity3 . a child actor with enduring success
he says he had quality unlike male stars of @entity24 : not powerful , but plucky , vulnerable
he conquered through energy , determination , not strength . his image was hopeful , sincere
@entity181 : he expressed how @entity59 *wanted* to see themselves
