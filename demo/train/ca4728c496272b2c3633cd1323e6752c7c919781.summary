@entity0 -- catholic cardinals have met for a second day tuesday at the @entity3 , but have not yet set a timetable for selecting a new pope			1
a total of 110 out of the 115 cardinal - electors , those younger than 80 who are eligible to elect the pope , are now in @entity0 , @entity3 spokesman the rev. @entity6 said tuesday			1
the five cardinal - electors who have not yet arrived have been in touch with the @entity13 , and the @entity3 knows when they are coming , he said			1
he did not say when that would be , however , or give reasons for their delayed arrival			2
no date has yet been proposed for the conclave to select pope @entity20 's successor , said @entity6			1
it is not necessary for all the cardinal - electors to be present for the conclave date to be set , he said , but they do have to be given time to get there			1
another @entity3 spokesman , the rev. @entity26 , said : " there is no desire to rush things but to take this time for discernment and reflection , and that 's been evident in the meetings thus far			1
" the famous @entity34 , where the secretive conclave takes place , was closed to the public at lunchtime tuesday for preparations and will remain so until further notice , the official @entity41 website said			1
those cardinals already in @entity0 met twice monday , in the morning and in the evening , as they began a series of meetings known as general congregations			1
the group decided that congregations on tuesday and wednesday would take place in the morning only			2
the general congregations are a key step before the conclave			1
@entity52 who want to speak in the meetings sign up to do so , and can speak for as long as they want on any topic they want , @entity6 said			2
so far , 33 cardinals have spoken			2
there are 148 in the congregations as of tuesday morning , he said			2
@entity1 : betting on the new pope according to @entity66 media reports , discussions monday focused on an internal investigation into leaks from the @entity3 , the outcome of which has so far been seen only by @entity20 , and the church 's handling of the scandal over child sex abuse by priests			1
the cardinals also talked about the kind of pope they want to see at the head of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity78			2
' as long as it takes ' @entity84 @entity52 @entity83 of @entity85 and @entity86 of @entity88 - @entity87 , speaking to reporters after tuesday 's congregation , said the cardinals were in no hurry to set a date for the conclave			1
" i think this is the most important decision that some of us will ever make , and we need to give it the time that 's necessary , " @entity83 said			1
" we want to have enough time in the general congregations so that when we go into the conclave , it 's a time of decision			1
this is a time of discernment and prayer and reflections			2
" " it takes as long as it takes , " @entity86 said , adding that there were " plenty of points of view among the cardinals " about when the conclave should begin			1
" no one really wants to rush this if it ca n't be rushed , " he said			2
both laughed off speculation that they could be elected pope , although some betting agencies rate @entity83 as the most likely @entity121 to become pope			2
@entity83 was asked if he would continue to wear his brown @entity124 robe if he did become pontiff			0
" i have worn this uniform for 40 years and i expect to wear it until i die , and that 's because i do n't expect to be elected pope , " he said			0
@entity86 , who lives in @entity129 , was then asked if he would keep wearing a cowboy hat if he became pope			0
" that 's an ' @entity134 ' question			0
we 're going down the rabbit hole in terms of my being elected pope , " he said			0
transfer of power @entity20 announced his intention to step down on february 11 and resigned thursday , becoming the first pope to do so in almost 600 years			0
the transfer of papal power has almost always happened after the sitting pope has died			0
normally , the @entity13 is not allowed to select a new pontiff until 15 to 20 days after the office becomes vacant			0
however , @entity20 amended the 500 - year - old policy to get a successor into place more rapidly			1
the cardinals may to be able to do so before march 15 , @entity6 has said			0
what 's in a name ? clues to be found in next pope 's moniker this would give the new pontiff more than a week to prepare for the march 24 palm sunday celebrations			0

favorites include the archbishop of @entity165 , @entity66 , cardinal @entity166 ; cardinal @entity167 of @entity66 ; cardinal @entity168 of @entity169 , who would become the first @entity171 pontiff since @entity173 i died more than 1,500 years ago ; and cardinal @entity174 of @entity175 , who would become the first @entity121 pope			1
while @entity20 has no direct involvement in the selection of his successor , his influence will be felt : he appointed 67 of at least 115 cardinals set to make the decision			1
@entity184 ' hearts and minds ' one former cardinal who wo n't participate in the conclave is @entity188 of @entity189 , who resigned last month			1
@entity188 apologized sunday for sexual impropriety , without specifying any incident			0
" to those i have offended , i apologize and ask forgiveness , " he said in a statement			0
the @entity3 refused to answer questions monday about whether it would discipline @entity188			1
@entity196 @entity78 pine for open - minded pope to heal rifts but others did comment			2
" it looks as if the incidence of abuse is practically zero right now as far as we can tell , but they are still the victims , and the wound therefore is deep in their hearts and minds very often , " cardinal @entity200 , archbishop of @entity201 , told reporters in @entity0			1
" as long as it 's with them , it 's with all of us			0
and that will last for a long time , so the next pope has to be aware of this			0
" @entity218 , the archbishop of @entity219 and apostolic administrator of the @entity221 and @entity222 , will administer @entity188 's archdiocese until a new appointment is made			0
" the most stinging charge which has been leveled against us in this matter is hypocrisy , and for obvious reasons , " @entity218 said monday night in a sermon at @entity226 in @entity219			0
" i think there is little doubt that the credibility and moral authority of the @entity78 in @entity189 has been dealt a serious blow , and we will need to come to terms with that			0
" representatives of a support group for abuse victims , @entity239 , or @entity239 , called monday for the cardinals to elect a new pope who is not a @entity244 insider			0
the group also called for some of the older cardinals to absent themselves from the @entity248 , arguing that some have been accused of complicity in protecting priests accused of sexually abusing children			0
" their peers should push them to stay home , or they should do so voluntarily , the group feels , for the sake of the church and to avoid heaping more pain on wounded victims and betrayed @entity78 , " a statement on @entity239 's website said			0
one of @entity66 's anti-clerical abuse networks , @entity265 , petitioned senior @entity3 cardinal @entity167 on monday not to allow the participation in the conclave of an @entity66 cardinal it alleges helped protect priests who molested minors in the past			1
@entity52 must vote in person , via paper ballot			0
