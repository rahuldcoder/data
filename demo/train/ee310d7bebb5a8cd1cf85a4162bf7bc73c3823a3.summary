-- it 's not a great sign for the music industry when the year 's top - selling album is the soundtrack to a @entity7 movie			1
so far in 2014 , there has n't been a single album from a music artist that 's sold a million copies or more , according to @entity13			2
while " @entity16 's " soundtrack has done just fine , with just over 3 million units sold as of october 10 , it seems music fans have n't been as eager about albums released by artists			1
in fact , the two performers who 've come closest to reaching platinum - level success in 2014 actually released their albums last year			1
@entity26 's self - titled artistic smash has gone on to notch 776,000 units so far this year , while @entity29 's " @entity28 " has pushed 754,000			1
even the " @entity16 " soundtrack is a holdover , as it arrived last november			0
as for 2014 releases , @entity31 is so far the biggest hit			0
the country star 's " @entity36 , " which arrived in february , has sold 722,000 , closely followed by @entity35 's " @entity34			2
" but perhaps not all hope is lost : 2014 still has some major players up ahead			0
@entity40 will release her latest album , " 1989 , " on october 27 , and the @entity43 ' " @entity42 " is slated for november			0
and if all else fails , maybe someone can convince @entity26 to drop another surprise album .			0

this year has seen a lack of platinum - selling albums
only the soundtrack to " frozen " has sold more than a million units
@entity54 and @entity35 are two of the year 's bigger releases
