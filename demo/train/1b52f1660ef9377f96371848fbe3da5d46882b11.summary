a now defunct suburban @entity2 swim club has agreed to a settlement more than three years after being accused of racism and discrimination for denying children from a largely minority day - care center access to their facility , the @entity0 said			1
under the terms of the deal with the @entity0 and the @entity15 , the @entity9 of @entity10 -- which filed for bankruptcy in november 2009 and had its property sold for $ 1.46 million the following june -- agreed to payouts to more than 50 children who were part of the @entity19 , their counselors and @entity21 itself			1
the distributed money includes whatever " remaining assets " from the sale of the club 's property to @entity27 of northeast @entity2 are leftover , once closing costs and associated fees have been covered , the @entity0 said thursday in a press release			2
the settlement also sets aside $ 65,000 to create a leadership council made up of former @entity9 members , @entity21 counselors , campers and their families			0
" no one may be denied the right to use a swimming pool because of their race or the color of their skin , " said @entity38 , the assistant attorney general heading the federal department 's civil rights division			0
creative steps , a day - care center based out of northeast @entity2 , had paid the @entity9 $ 1,950 in june of 2009 so its children could access its pool over the summer			1
" i was excited , " @entity53 , founder of @entity21 , told @entity54 at the time			0
" the children were excited , and parents were excited			0
" but when the young day campers came to the club for the first time , " the children reported hearing racial slurs while enjoying the pool , " the @entity0 said thursday			1
@entity63 , who was 12 at the time and a camper with @entity21 , recalled some club members asking , " why are these black kids here ? they might steal from us			0
" " it 's kind of sad that people are still thinking like this , " @entity63 said then , with tears streaming down his face , " i thought those days were over			0
" on july 3 , 2009 , " the club refunded the day camp 's membership fee and prohibited the children from returning to swim , " the @entity0 said			1
the club later issued a response denying that race had anything to do with its decision to exclude the children , contending instead that " we underestimated the capacity of our facilities			0
" around that time , @entity88 repeatedly lambasted the club for its tepid response to the accusations and said the children in her care were " emotionally damaged " by the incident			2
a few months later , in november 2009 , the swim club filed for bankruptcy because of legal bills and liabilities tied to its decision to cancel swimming privileges for the day - camp children			1
the following january , the @entity0 opened its investigation into the racial discrimination allegations			2
the settlement detailed thursday closes a key chapter in the saga , with one @entity108 official saying she hopes the entire , public ordeal makes it less likely discrimination will happen in the years to come			2
" our hope is that this case serves as prevention for years to come and a reminder that discrimination is illegal , and has no place in @entity108 , " said @entity112 , executive director of the @entity15			0
