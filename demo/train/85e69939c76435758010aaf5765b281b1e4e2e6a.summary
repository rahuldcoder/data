-- with his heroics at the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity1 has blazed a trail through history			1
defying injury , an all - night marathon and several of the world 's best tennis players , he became the first @entity12 man to reach a @entity13 singles final			1
the 24 - year - old dredged up a seismic shock to dispatch world no. 1 @entity16 on saturday and even though he lost to @entity18 in monday 's final , there 's surely more to come from @entity1			1
" we have been waiting such a long time for a star like this so this is a very big moment , " says @entity20 of @entity22 's @entity21			2
if this suggests @entity22 tennis history adds up to a barren wasteland , it does not tell the full story			1
while the post- 1968 @entity32 has produced consistent under - performance , the @entity22 once enjoyed a golden age			1
the boom was sparked by an expatriate elite that adopted the game , known as a sport for gentlemen , on their travels in the early 20th century , particularly in @entity42			0
the aristocrats went on to establish clubs and tournaments back home			1
participation and standards climbed , and @entity22 players became a serious force during the interwar years			2
among the finest of these , @entity52 reached the @entity53 " all comers ' final " of 1920 -- a match that would decide who took on the defending champion for that year 's title			0
in the prestigious grass - court tournament 's original format , the titleholder had to play just once			0
@entity52 lost in three close sets to @entity65 @entity64 , who would go on to beat @entity67 @entity66 for the first of 10 grand slam titles in an illustrious career , but he had made his mark as a rising star			1
the @entity22 established a national association the same year , which allowed them to enter the 1921 @entity74 with a formidable two - man team of @entity52 and @entity76 , a banker by trade once described as the " best player in @entity65 " by the @entity79			2
he reached the semifinals of the 1918 @entity65 @entity81 and won silver medals in singles and doubles at the @entity85			0
the pair reeled off @entity74 triumphs over @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity67 before eventually succumbing to the @entity65 in the final			0
this remains @entity22 's best performance in the prestigious competition and was a source of great national pride			2
a @entity98 article praised the " tennis marvels ... doing as much to put @entity22 right before the world as all the diplomats put together			2
" the pair continued to enjoy success and were joined by fresh talent			0
@entity105 soared in a run of five grand slam semifinals in a little over two years			1
he beat legends of the game @entity110 and @entity111 and seemed set to claim a top title			0
but @entity105 's career ended tragically in 1934 when he leaped to his death from a ship after a @entity74 defeat , leaving a note that expressed his shame			0
@entity119 marked the end of his nation 's ascendancy , ushering in a fallow period that would endure to the present day			0
after @entity22 had recovered enough to contemplate sport , tennis remained popular with aristocrats -- including the royal family and crown prince akihito -- but public interest slipped away toward baseball and football , and the talent production line ceased			1
through the professional era , male @entity22 players barely troubled the top 100 , with @entity136 's third - round performance at the @entity137 among the highlights			1
it was not until the 1990s heyday of @entity141 that any respectability was restored			0
that period also witnessed the rise of a women 's star in @entity145 , who reached three grand slam semifinals and a high of fourth in the rankings before retiring			1
since her comeback in 2008 she has added another @entity152 title to her career haul , is the oldest player in the top 100 singles rankings and reached the women 's doubles semis in @entity4 just over three weeks away from her 44th birthday			0
@entity141 never passed a grand slam quarterfinal , but his contribution is being felt now			1
@entity1 calls him " the first " successful @entity22 men 's player , the only role model on his route to the top			1
passing his hero 's ranking of 46 was @entity1 's driving motivation until he attained it			2
now , having entered the top 10 in may and breaking new ground every season , he could be launching a new golden era			1
sponsors , publicity and funding have poured into the game off the back of @entity1 's efforts			2
public interest and attendances surged last year after he became the first home champion of the @entity181 since 1972 -- he won the title in october 2012 -- and peaked again this week due to his @entity4 success			2
not that @entity1 gets to see much of that , since he lives in @entity185			0
seven @entity22 players are ranked in the men 's top 200 -- a record in the open era -- though @entity1 is the only one in the top 100			1
however , journalist @entity20 is not yet convinced the structure is in place for @entity22 to become an elite tennis nation			2
" @entity1 grew up practicing at the ( @entity196 ) academy in @entity185 , " he said			0
" i think we still do n't have enough players or quality coaches			0
maybe more players should learn abroad			0
" @entity20 has no doubt that @entity1 's run in @entity4 represents @entity22 's greatest moment in tennis and one of its greatest in any sport			1
the jubilation sweeping the country suggests he is right			0
at last , @entity209 and @entity52 have an heir to fulfil the nation 's dreams .			0

@entity1 will play in his first grand slam inal at the @entity3 on monday
he is the first @entity22 male to reach @entity13 final
@entity1 is highest ranked @entity22 man of @entity32 , having broken top 10
his exploits have created a surge of interest in tennis back home
