i still remember sitting on the set of " crossfire " that day in 2004 as the floor manager counted down to blastoff			2
i was thinking : " @entity5 , wow			1
i hope @entity6 is watching			2
" my wife , truth be told , rarely watched " @entity3 , " but she rarely missed " @entity9			1
" by the time @entity5 finished disemboweling my show , i was hoping she was n't watching			1
from my perspective , the show that day was a debacle			1
i was unprepared for the onslaught since @entity5 had recently been on " @entity15 " ( @entity16 ' truly awful knockoff of " crossfire " ) , and had not attacked that show at all			1
but he had a different agenda this day			2
i thought his charge that a 30 - minute debate show was " hurting @entity22 " was fatuous			1
but i love direct confrontation ( obviously )			2
and i was not defensive because , as a former senior @entity26 official , i know that being a cable tv host would never be the most important thing i do in my career			2
so i was actually interested in hearing @entity5 's full critique of " @entity3			1
" i heard that full critique eventually , but the audience never did			1
the show went off the rails and @entity5 , who began by denouncing our hostile environment , was within minutes calling @entity38 " a dick			1
" so he never got to deliver his thoughtful , insightful criticism of our show -- until after the cameras were turned off			1
when the show ended , @entity5 and his executive producer , @entity44 , sat with me and " @entity3 's " executive producer , @entity46 , for 90 minutes			1
we had the kind of thoughtful , respectful dialogue that our audience deserved but never got			1
it has been 10 years , and i do not have contemporaneous notes			2
and , as we have been reminded recently , memory is a tricky and unreliable resource			2
still , this is what i remember from our chat : @entity5 thought it was absurd to pretend every issue could be reduced to a forced choice between the right and the left			1
i thought that was a good point			2
some issues have seven sides , but better to air two than none			2
how @entity5 changed politics then he said we deliberately booked the show to provoke division			1
a discussion of religion , for example , would feature a debate between , say , the @entity76			2
@entity77 and @entity78 , when the truth is most believers fall somewhere in between			2
his criticism stung because i agreed this was a major shortcoming of our program			2
@entity5 's third point , though , is where we parted company			1
i asked him how he would organize a show like ours			1
he suggested that , on @entity90 , for example , rather than two opposing politicians , we should get the nation 's foremost expert -- say , from @entity93 -- and ask him or her what should be done to shore up our retirement system			0
i told him that was silly , forgetting that this is precisely what he tries to do with his " @entity9 " interviews			0
this is not sophomore philosophy , i told him			0
there is no objective , @entity104 truth			0
some people , like me , believe retirement should be partly socialized			0
others , such as @entity38 , believe in a purely private system : if you do n't save for your own retirement , your neighbor has no obligation to bail you out			0
both arguments have roots in the @entity22 spirit : we are at once wonderfully communitarian and intensely individualistic			0
i felt then -- and now -- that rather than pretend there is not a major philosophical difference , or that there is one objectively perfect solution , we should debate our policy options vigorously			0
@entity5 's top 5 political moments i still think @entity5 's version of politics is naive			1
@entity126 is not -- and should not be -- the @entity127 , where each side each takes a turn			0
giving @entity131 control of the @entity26 on mondays , wednesdays and fridays , and @entity132 the gavel on tuesdays and thursdays would be madness			0
the founders designed the system to create conflict : that 's why we have three equal branches of government , each checking the other			0
and yet @entity5 did have a point about excessive partisanship			1
he called me a hack -- which i am , if by " hack " you mean someone who is a true believer in a particular political worldview			0
i believe deeply in the @entity153 's vision for @entity22 -- and yet i also believe there is a time for bipartisan cooperation , and was proud to work for president @entity157 as he pursued many bipartisan efforts			0
then and now i believed we needed more partisanship , not less , in the run - up to the @entity162			0
i was a vociferous , bitter opponent of @entity164 's war			0
what hurt @entity22 is that too few people were yelling about the looming disaster ; too many were cowed into going along with the bipartisan consensus that we should send other people 's sons and daughters to fight against a country that posed no threat to @entity22			0
i am proud i was a loud voice of opposition			0
as i recall it , @entity5 heard me out earnestly			1
despite the televised food fight we 'd just been in , he was gracious and respectful , curious and thoughtful			1
as he got up to leave , he left us with this moment of @entity180 : " @entity181 came to @entity126 and bashed you guys , and he got like 300 new stations			0
so i think this will work out for me			0
it also worked out for me			0
@entity1 canceled " crossfire " but has kept me on as a contributor , a role that i prefer			0
it gives me far more freedom than " @entity3 " did			1
rather than always narrowly toeing the party line , i am more free to criticize my people , for example , when president @entity195 failed to go to the @entity197 border to see the child immigration crisis firsthand			0
i have not spoken to @entity5 since that day			1
i ran into him in a hotel lobby once , and he darted away like he 'd seen a ghost			0
when i had a book i wanted to plug on his show , he would n't take my call			1
but i have remained an avid fan of " @entity9 , " and will miss his searing , satirical wit			0
even though he no doubt ca n't stand me , i stand by my introduction of @entity5 that day on " @entity3 " : he is both the smartest funnyman on tv and the funniest smart man on tv .			1
