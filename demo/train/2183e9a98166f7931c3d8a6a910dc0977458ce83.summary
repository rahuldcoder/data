@entity0 -- five former @entity3 security guards pleaded not guilty tuesday to voluntary manslaughter charges and other crimes stemming from a shooting incident in @entity7 that left 17 @entity8 dead			1
former @entity3 security @entity9 , center , leaves court after his arraignment tuesday			0
each of the former guards has been charged with 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime			1
the five defendants , seated in a row at a courtroom table , remained silent in court , and as they entered and departed the courthouse			0
a lawyer entered their plea on their behalf			0
attorney @entity31 , speaking for all the defendants outside the courthouse , predicted they will be proved innocent			0
" we want to make it clear to everyone these men committed no crime			2
they were defending themselves on a battlefield in a war zone when this occurred , " he said			1
if convicted , the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count , seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter , and a 30 - year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge			2
judge @entity54 set a trial date for february 1 , 2010			0
he agreed with defense attorneys that preparations for the complex case will require a full year , including the likely need for lawyers to travel to @entity7 to gather information and conduct interviews			1
" the @entity64 government had a year and a half to investigate the case , and we did not			2
so we need a year to catch up , " @entity31 told reporters			0
lead government prosecutor @entity68 did not comment outside court			0
the @entity7 incident , which occurred september 16 , 2007 , exacerbated the feelings of many @entity8 that private @entity64 security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for @entity8 law or life			1
it also created an extremely delicate political situation for the @entity79 administration and the @entity8 government			1
the five defendants are @entity9 , 26 , of @entity82 , @entity83 ; @entity84 , 27 , of @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87 , 26 , of @entity88 , @entity89 ; @entity90 , 25 , of @entity91 , @entity86 ; and @entity92 , 29 , of @entity93 , @entity94			0
a sixth former security guard , @entity95 , 35 , of @entity96 , has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter			0
prosecutors did not bring manslaughter charges for three of the 17 fatalities because they do not believe they have enough evidence to win a conviction in those deaths			1
the company of @entity3 does not face any charges			0
the indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of @entity111 contractors under the @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , which was amended in 2004 to allow the @entity114 to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the @entity119 overseas			1
" the attorneys for the defendants contend that @entity3 's employees in @entity8 are exempt from the provisions of @entity113 because the company has a contract in @entity8 with the @entity126 , not the @entity119			1
also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by @entity126 diplomatic security agents , who were investigating the incident before the @entity133 tried to interview them once it took over			2
the @entity126 maintains its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution , but promised only that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution			2
but when the investigation was turned over to the @entity114 to examine possible criminal activity , @entity133 agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again , complicating the @entity133 probe			2
a recently approved @entity147 pointedly specifies that @entity64 civilian contractors will no longer be immune from @entity8 prosecution for crimes committed in that country			1
