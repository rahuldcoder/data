-- the " do - nothing " @entity1 is the most misleading expression in politics			1
with the start of the final period in this congressional session , politicians and pundits have been writing one story after another about how little legislation is likely to pass in the coming months			1
" @entity1 , " " @entity13 to @entity12 , " " what the ' @entity14 ' is doing on @entity16 " and " will the ' @entity18 ' @entity19 in @entity20 ? " are just some of the headlines			1
@entity1 , they say , will sit idly and do nothing while the world burns			1
a recent @entity0 / @entity25 poll found that 83 % of @entity26 do n't approve of the way @entity1 is working			1
a stunning 65 % believe it to be the worst @entity1 of " their lifetime			1
" comparisons abound with the famous 80th @entity1 that president @entity32 lambasted in 1948			1
yes , few major bills will pass			2
but the term gives a skewed picture of the effects of obstruction			0
let 's stop calling it a " do - nothing " @entity1			1
for reporters and politicians who use it , the term is a cop - out			1
by doing nothing , @entity1 is actually doing a lot , though the consequences are not very pretty			1
inaction can make things worse			0
and that 's exactly what 's happening now			2
these are some of the problems that will worsen , thanks to @entity1 ' failure : immigration : doing nothing in this case means leaving millions of lives hanging in the balance			1
families must continue to live in the shadows , fearful of deportation and unable to gain access to the best jobs and educational opportunities			2
the @entity66 recently published a story featuring a mother in @entity69 named @entity70 who has been somberly watching the news about president @entity73 's decision to delay action on changing immigration policy since her @entity77 husband -- who has been in the @entity26 for over a decade and whose stay of deportation was canceled -- is at risk to be deported			1
climate change : the stakes of failure to act on climate continue to grow			0
respected scientists across the globe have documented the dangerous impact of our current business , environmental and energy practices and their role in enabling intolerable levels of greenhouse emissions			0
more carbon dioxide is getting pumped into the atmosphere , sea levels are rising , and more species are at risk			2
last summer , a bipartisan group of officials , including former treasury secretaries @entity102 and @entity104 , catalogued the immense environmental and economic effects			0
they urged remedies in the near future , such as the imposition of a carbon tax			0
without any change , the costs will rise			0
" @entity114 is not a strategy , " @entity102 said			0
last week , the @entity116 reported that the levels of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere are higher than ever before			0
the @entity120 gave a very specific result : half of the @entity124 bird species are at risk as a result of the new temperatures			0
presidential war power : legislators have a lot to say about @entity131 , @entity132 and military challenges overseas			1
at this point , however , they have not been voting on anything			0
@entity1 has limited itself to the safe role of being the monday morning quarterback			1
these are the exactly the kinds of conditions that create incentives and room for presidential war power to keep growing			1
indeed , @entity145 rep. @entity144 urged @entity73 to do something rather than waiting for @entity1 to act			2
" i think the president should take action and then i think the @entity1 should pass legislation supporting what the president does , " he said on @entity0			1
in no uncertain terms , @entity73 has said that he can act without congressional consent if necessary			0
historically , the biggest check to presidential war power has been when @entity1 is assertive , with its power over the military budget and oversight			1
when it is inactive , presidents use executive authority , and they do so with impunity			0
@entity165 sen. @entity164 and @entity167 congressman @entity166 have proposed bills authorizing the president to use military power for a limit of three years against @entity131			0
@entity1 should move forward with a vote on their legislation , putting a strong congressional imprint on the policies dictating what kind of military force will be used			1
agency planning : although not quite as sexy as the other issues , agencies suffer under the current legislative process			0
over the past decade , the chaotic budgeting process that @entity1 has used has left agencies constantly scrambling and uncertain about what kind of funding is ahead			2
long - term planning and strategic investments are difficult in this kind of environment			0
by holding back on spending bills and constantly raising the possibility of government shutdowns , @entity1 prevents federal agencies from carrying on the business of government			2
in this case , the " do - nothing " @entity1 places handcuffs on civil servants			1
middle - class insecurity : a lot of ink ( in printer cartridges ) has been spilled in the past few years documenting the growing problem of economic inequality in the @entity26 the rich keep getting richer , the poor keep slipping even further behind and the middle class lives in a state of peril			2
there are many factors behind this development , but government policy has been one of them			0
tax policies that give disproportionate relief to wealthier @entity26 and the failure to update and strengthen social safety net programs that benefit the disadvantaged have been major culprits			0
government investment in growing areas of the economy that could compensate for slow growth in older and failing sectors has not been forthcoming as the parties remain locked in a stalemate			0
government wo n't solve the problem of inequality and insecurity , but it can certainly make conditions much better			0
that happened during the 1930s and 1940s , when @entity234 rallied the public behind federal programs that produced one of @entity26 's greatest periods of economic growth			2
right now , @entity1 is saying no to any new solutions			2
the result is that the fabric of the country continues to become frail			0
in all of these areas , and more , @entity1 worsens @entity26 's problems by standing still			1
starting with this fall 's midterm campaigns , voters must increase pressure on @entity1 to do something different than the current path and to offer compromise solutions to these problems			1
in the meantime , the media and our political leaders have an obligation to stop using a term that obscures the impact of what is taking place .			0

@entity264 : it 's a cop - out to let this @entity1 be known as " do - nothing "
by failing to pass *significant* legislation , @entity1 is actively worsening our problems , he says
@entity264 : immigrant families are kept at risk , the economic *recovery* proceeds very slowly
he says a passive @entity1 fails to provide a check on presidential war powers
