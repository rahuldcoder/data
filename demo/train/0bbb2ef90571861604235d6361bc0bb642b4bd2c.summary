-- february 25 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : northeastern @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : i 'm @entity18 , and today , @entity0 is taking you to school ! middle school , high school , college : all of them in today 's show			1
first up , though , we 're heading to the hill			2
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : @entity28 , where a @entity30 committee is holding hearings on @entity26 recalls			1
yesterday , the company 's president , @entity33 , explained what he thinks is the reason for some of the company 's recent problems			1
@entity33 , @entity41 president : @entity26 has , for the past few years , been expanding its business rapidly			1
quite frankly , i fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick			2
i would like to point out here that @entity26 's priority has traditionally been the following : first , safety ; second , quality ; third , volume			1
these priorities became confused , and we were not able to stop , think and make improvements as much as we were able to before			1
and our basic stance to listen to customers ' voices to make better products has weakened somewhat			1
@entity27 : mr. @entity33 says he 's committed to restoring his company 's reputation			1
some people have blamed the @entity4 government for not acting sooner			0
but transportation secretary @entity62 says that is not the case			0
@entity62 , @entity4 transportation secretary : we have n't been sitting around on our hands			0
when people complain , we investigate			0
when there needs to be a recall , we do it			0
of the 100 investigations @entity74 opens in an average year , there are currently 44 open defect investigations , 5 of which involve @entity26			1
every step of the way , @entity74 officials have pushed @entity26 to take corrective action so that consumers would be safe			1
economic outlook @entity27 : meantime , a different committee was hearing @entity86 chairman @entity85 's outlook on the country 's economy			1
@entity85 heads up the nation 's central bank			1
he says the @entity4 economy is getting better , but he does n't expect it to grow too much this year ; only about 3 to 3.5 percent			0
he 's also worried about the job market			1
@entity85 says it 's still very weak			1
unemployment is around 9.7 percent			0
he predicts that 'll drop to around 7 percent , but not until the end of 2012			1
that statistic might get some help from a new jobs bill being considered by @entity99			0
the @entity100 approved a $ 15 billion version yesterday			0
senate majority leader @entity102 called it a " small but important step " in trying to pass a jobs bill			0
but some critics say the @entity100 's proposal would n't do nearly enough			1
word to the @entity109 @entity110 , @entity16 : a word to the @entity109 ... nor'easter ( noun ) a type of storm with extremely strong winds , which can produce heavy rain and cause powerful waves nor'easter @entity27 : a nor'easter is what 's on the radar for parts of the @entity4 experts think it could bring rain , snow , heavy winds			1
and these are areas that have already been hammered by severe winter weather			0
as you might guess , a nor'easter affects the northeast part of the country			0
but that 's not where the name comes from			1
@entity140 , @entity141 : @entity18 , we 'll talk about nor'easter because of the way the wind comes in with the storm			0
the wind literally comes from the @entity148			0
we talk about winds ; we talk about a @entity151 wind			0
a west wind comes from the @entity151			0
a @entity148 wind comes from the @entity148			0
and that 's the storm , that 's the wind that picks up all the moisture and dumps it right here in the form of snow across @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
some spots , before this all stops , with blizzard - like conditions , will have 24 - 36 inches of snow			0
another big storm for the @entity148 , and people digging out again , @entity18			0
hero teacher @entity27 : thanks , @entity171			0
@entity172 is being hailed as a hero			0
he 's a math teacher who tackled a gunman who opened fire at a middle school on tuesday			1
the suspect is in custody			0
two students were wounded in the attack			1
they were both treated at a nearby hospital			0
all this happened at @entity183 in @entity5 , @entity6			0
that is the same town where , eleven years ago , two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at @entity188			1
after that incident , many schools across the nation , maybe even yours , started having emergency drills			0
mr. @entity172 says that a promise he made during those led to his actions yesterday			0
@entity197 , @entity183 math teacher : whenever we had had these drills and whenever we had worked with students , i said basically , if something happens and there is something i can do about it , i want to try and do something about it			1
webcam spying ? @entity27 : around the @entity4 , technology is being used to help education			1
some schools let you take laptops home			0
one @entity162 high school included a security measure to protect against the computers being stolen			1
but a student at the school says the way the technology was used was a violation of his privacy			1
@entity223 has the details on that			0
( begin video ) @entity227 , @entity0 correspondent : this is high school sophomore @entity229			1
his school issued him and more than 2,000 other students laptops for their studies			1
what the students and families did n't know was that school officials had installed software that could turn on the laptop 's camera without notice , without warning and watch them			1
before @entity246 knew it , he found himself in the assistant principal 's office at @entity162 's @entity249 , accused , he says , of pushing drugs			1
@entity229 , @entity251 : i could n't say anything because she was accusing me of selling drugs			0
i could n't fight back , but i thought that this was terrible , how could they do this ? @entity259 , @entity246 's mom : she said that she had pictures of @entity246 that were taken on his computer of him holding up little , what she thought were pills			1
@entity266 : how could the school have seen what @entity246 was doing ? we set up a web camera in our office to show you how this all works			1
this is my laptop and it has a web camera built in to it			1
that tiny hole right there ? that 's the camera			1
so , all anyone has to do , whether they 're sitting a few feet away or maybe even hundreds of miles away , is click a button to record everything i 'm doing in front of this web camera			0
that 's exactly what @entity246 's parents say the school district did			1
they say the school remotely accessed his computer without his knowledge and snapped a photo of him			2
@entity246 's family is suing			2
@entity297 robbins : it was an invasion of privacy ; it was as if we had a @entity301 in our house			0
@entity266 : the @entity303 is investigating to see if wiretap or computer intrusion laws were violated			0
the school district says in the last fourteen months , 42 laptops were reported missing or stolen , 18 of them recovered			2
a spokesman for the school district told @entity0 they would only remotely access the laptop if it had been reported stolen or missing so they could find out who was using it			1
but @entity246 's parents say his computer had not been reported missing or stolen			2
if that 's true , why was anyone from the school accessing the camera ? the school district says these are just allegations , and " the district never did and never would use such tactics as a basis for disciplinary action			1
" in fact , it insists no school administrators could even access the cameras ; only two people in the technology department			2
a letter from the superintendent admits " ... there was no explicit notification that the laptop contained the security software			2
this notice should have been given and we regret that was not done			0
" now , school officials say the web camera security feature has been completely disabled			2
as for @entity246 and those so - called " pills " he says the school thought he was holding on camera , his mom claims they were candy ! ( @entity348 ) tuition soars @entity27 : all right			2
we 've covered a story about a middle school about a high school ; it 's time for college			1
getting there might take more money than ever before			0
( begin video ) @entity27 : the cost of going to college is skyrocketing			0
the @entity362 expects to raise tuition by 30 percent for the 2010 - 2011 school year			2
of course , it 's in a state that has a $ 20 billion budget deficit			1
but this increase in college costs is something that 's expected nationwide			2
from @entity371 to @entity372 to @entity373 , public universities are estimating hikes of between 10 and 15 percent			0
the reason : what else ? the recession			0
public schools get some of their money from states			0
states have less money to give , since they 're already in debt			0
so , schools have to make up their deficits by charging students more			1
it 's still a lot less expensive to attend a public college , though			2
average cost this school year for a public university : around $ 7,000			2
for a private school : more than $ 26,000			2
what 's interesting about all this is that there 's still more demand for education ; college enrollment continues to climb			2
for schools , that could be good news : they 'll be likely to get more of the money they need			2
for students , well , there 's always financial aid , student loans , and the value of a college degree			1
( @entity348 ) before we go @entity27 : before we go , a story that might warm your heart , and your toes , and the toes of about 200 other people			0
it is the world 's longest blanket ! this thing just keeps on going			2
more than 450 feet long ! it 's on display in @entity8 right now			2
that 's where it was made			2
then , the behemoth blanket will weave its way around the country			0
and finally , it 'll either be sold or divvied up and donated to charity			0
goodbye @entity27 : we wish there was more to tell you , but that pretty much covers it			0

consider a *controversy* that was *sparked* by a school laptop 's webcam
