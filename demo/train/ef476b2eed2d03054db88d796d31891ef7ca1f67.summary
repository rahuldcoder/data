@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a housing market plagued by one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , finding and buying a home would seem to be an easy hunt , especially if you 're armed with federal funding assistance			1
@entity11 made nearly 30 bids before she was able to buy a home with help from a federal loan program			1
the sheer mass of real estate available at a record - low price combined with a no - interest loan from the government and an $ 8,000 income tax credit for first - time buyers quickly persuaded 30 - year - old @entity11 to make the leap into home ownership			1
it was n't as easy as she thought it would be , even for someone determined to buy her first home			2
@entity11 's realtor and long - time friend , @entity31 , started compiling foreclosure listings more than three months ago , as soon as @entity33 was approved for a $ 15,000 down - payment loan through the federally funded @entity35			1
the loan program is aimed at helping would - be home buyers stabilize distressed neighborhoods while also helping banks unload foreclosures			1
the @entity0 program offers up to $ 15,000 in financial assistance toward a down payment or closing costs to approved applicants who are , in turn , required to provide $ 1,000 of their own funds toward the purchase of a foreclosed property at 1 percent below appraisal value			1
the loan has to be repaid when the home buyer sells or refinances			0
nationwide , the program has allocated $ 6 billion to 250 cities and housing markets			1
each city or market determines specific allocation amounts for locally run programs involving both home purchases and property rehabilitation			2
@entity0 received more than $ 39 million			1
however , after rolling out the home ownership assistance portion of the program six months ago , program funding has been used in the purchase of just three homes			2
@entity11 is proud to be the third @entity0 home buyer funded by the program , but she cautions other program applicants , " it 's been rough			1
it 's been a long process			0
" @entity11 endured almost 30 rejected bids placed on homes throughout northwest @entity0 before a bank finally accepted a $ 140,000 offer on a 1,100 square - foot home			1
she admits to tears of frustration and said she almost considered giving up on the program in favor of moving in with family and saving toward a conventional loan			0
she eventually decided on optimism instead			0
speculating in retrospect on why banks rejected so many of her offers , she said , " i think it 's because the program has n't been out there enough			0
" other cities are also having some slow starts or are trying a different tack with their funds			0
@entity97 , @entity98 , which received $ 32.8 million in funding , has a program similar to @entity0 's			1
four homes have been purchased thus far and two others are in escrow and pending			0
@entity104 , @entity105 , will roll out its home buyer assistance program on thursday			2
@entity108 , @entity107 -- which received $ 55.2 million , more program funds than any other @entity111 city -- is using its money in a different way			2
instead of an individual or family home buyer assistance program , it is focusing on loans to established organizations and nonprofit groups , which will then assist individual home buyers in buying lender - owned properties in the city			1
@entity122 , assistant secretary at the @entity123 , told @entity124 that the initial stage of the program has been difficult , in part , because the cities and communities involved in the program have never done this work before			0
" it 's a lot of work to implement , " said @entity132 , who feels the program is on track overall			0
@entity124 : read how the program is progressing around the country despite her many frustrations , @entity11 is being touted as a success story by @entity0 's deputy housing director , @entity142			1
bears , who compared some @entity0 neighborhoods to " ghost towns , " she said , " it 's a drop in the bucket , but if you 're in a neighborhood and you see one or two homes that are purchased , you are encouraged with each one , and so i see this as a catalyst			2
" city officials acknowledge there is still a learning curve that must take place between them , the real estate owners ( foreclosure owners are typically banks ) and lenders			1
potential home buyers must also complete an eight - hour class and participate in a one - on - one counseling session on the program to secure qualification			1
" i think we 're seeing momentum now			0
it was a little slow because we had to get a lot of people onboard , " @entity143 said			0
@entity0 housing officials hope to help about 900 home buyers before the loan program ends in october 2010			1
city officials said the goal can be met , despite what critics and @entity143 herself are calling a " slow start			1
" she said 10 qualified home sales are pending , and data provided by the city housing officials showed 72 area families have qualified for the program and are shopping			1
" we 're doing everything we can to get the word out , " @entity143 said , including a telethon last week aimed at the city 's @entity188 - speaking residents			0
critics of the program 's slow progress also blame real estate investors for showing a renewed interest in @entity0			1
its beleaguered housing market was originally created , many argue , by those very same investors			0
@entity31 , @entity11 's @entity202 , said he hears complaints from his clients who are constantly beaten to the deals by investors			2
" from a buyer 's standpoint , [ program participants ] can get outbid with a lower bid from a cash investor			0
yeah , that 's pretty frustrating , " @entity31 said			0
bears confirmed the city 's data reflects the same frustrations			0
" almost half of the resale homes that are happening right now are to investors , so we 're finding that people who are participating in our program are having to make upwards of 20 offers ... to compete with investors , " @entity143 said			2
she said cash investors " have the ability to pick the best of the properties and then sometimes buy packets of properties ... sight unseen			2
" @entity11 is enjoying a backyard view from her new patio			2
she proudly described her new abode as " small ... cute			0
" she said she still believes in the program and encourages participants to be diligent with constant bids and , above all , have patience			0
" it 's a give and take , really , but you 're more giving than taking , unfortunately , " she said			0
" hopefully , the next person wo n't go through what i went through			0

@entity11 took three months , nearly 30 bids to buy home
nearly $ 6 billion has been allocated for @entity35
investors are often outbidding potential home buyers for @entity0 properties
city officials think program is beginning to take off , hope to help 900 families
