-- fifty years ago , a @entity1 and a @entity2 -- seared by the devastation of @entity4 -- forged an enterprise with the less than exciting name of the @entity7			2
west @entity2 chancellor @entity8 and @entity1 prime minister @entity10 's modest beginning to @entity12 integration -- to tie together the coal and steel industries of @entity1 , @entity15 and the @entity17 countries -- would over the next half - century become a behemoth of 27 states , many of which did n't even exist in 1952			1
that @entity23 vision is now at an historic crossroads and could over the next months begin to shred			2
a dysfunctional legacy the @entity12 club has both expanded in number and deepened in purpose			1
beginning as a common market with expensive subsidies to farmers , it evolved into a community with coordinated foreign and trade policies , open borders among many members , a common social policy and a powerful @entity38			2
vast sums have been spent on infrastructure for poorer members			0
most notably , the @entity42 , named after the @entity44 town where it was signed in 1992 , began the process of monetary union and -- supposedly -- economic convergence among member states			0
the first part happened ; the second did not			0
a " stability and growth pact " was meant to harmonize interest rates , inflation and government deficits			0
but there were no enforcement mechanisms beyond sharp words and a slap on the wrist			0
@entity1 and @entity15 were among the first states to breach the commandment that deficits shalt not exceed 3 % of gdp			0
some critics argue that @entity12 is like the python that swallowed a goat			1
in 1990 , there were 12 members of the @entity23 ; now , the 27 members span an area from @entity72 to @entity73 , from @entity74 to @entity75			0
how @entity12 grapples with the dysfunctional legacy of both an unbalanced deepening and headlong expansion will decide whether the eurozone recovers or withers			1
the state of things now the first hurdle to overcome is the @entity84 election			1
should a working majority emerge under the leadership of the @entity87 , @entity84 may follow through with the next tranche of public spending cuts demanded by its " troika " of creditors : the @entity93 , the @entity94 and the @entity95			1
the new @entity84 government will expect in return help from the troika rather than the same diet of austerity , arguing that the @entity84 people have to be offered some incentive to endure more sacrifice			1
but if political paralysis begun by may 's vote continues , the uncertainty over whether @entity84 can remain in the eurozone will intensify			1
even if a weak pro-bailout government is formed , @entity84 is already behind on its obligations to privatize state industries and improve tax receipts			1
for @entity84 , tax evasion is a national sport ; the government is owed nearly 50 billion euros in back taxes			1
@entity84 media suggest depositors have withdrawn up to 5 billion euros from local banks in the past two weeks			1
uncertainty in @entity84 would in turn intensify the pressure on @entity122 and @entity123 , amid doubts about the whole eurozone enterprise			1
the combined economies of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity84 -- the three countries that have been bailed out -- are smaller than that of @entity122 , which has quickly been dubbed " too big to bail , too big to fail			1
" the @entity23 's willingness to help bail out @entity122 's massively indebted banking system to the tune of 100 billion euros ( $ 125 billion ) produced a " relief rally " on the bond and stock markets , but the relief scarcely lasted 24 hours			2
by the end of last week , the yield on @entity122 's 10 - year bond hovered around 7 % , the financial equivalent of being admitted to intensive care with a raging fever			2
the new @entity122 government has resisted a full bailout , arguing that it has undertaken drastic economic reform and that government finances ( not too awful ) should not be confused with the banks ' ( dreadful )			0
but the influential ratings agencies do see a link ; @entity152 's has cut @entity122 sovereign debt to just a notch above junk status , on a par with @entity157			2
unemployment is at record highs , especially among the young ; house prices are collapsing			0
the @entity123 are also getting fed up with austerity , as prime minister @entity162 acknowledged in a recent interview with @entity0 's @entity164			2
he has joined the " growth club " with new @entity1 president @entity165 but has precious little room for maneuver , as the price on @entity123 debt has also risen			0
the @entity94 has praised @entity162 's efforts to sort out @entity123 's public finances but says deregulation and labor reform require further effort , just as the @entity123 economy is forecast to shrink 2 % this year			2
from outside the eurozone , its partners look on with horror			2
the governor of the @entity181 , @entity182 , said last month , " our biggest trading partner is tearing itself apart with no obvious solution			0
" what will be @entity12 's future ? going forward ( and , admittedly , simplifying the scenarios ) , @entity12 is looking at three paths , according to political and financial analysts			1
the first and most traumatic is a disorderly collapse of the eurozone , starting in @entity84 but spreading to @entity122 and @entity123			1
this scenario begins with anything less than a clear victory for the " bailout " parties in @entity84 , followed by the virtual implosion of the @entity84 state , whose coffers are nearly empty			1
the current economy minister says @entity84 has enough money to survive until july 15			1
in this scenario , @entity15 opts to puts fiscal rectitude ahead of its pan-european principles			0
many @entity2 are already thinking this way			0
deputy finance minister @entity208 told the @entity209 on thursday that debt was a " national responsibility			0
" " i do n't see any strategies where we socialize and redistribute the bad political decisions made by some who are over-indebted , " he said			0
@entity15 has ruled out the introduction of eurobonds , which would essentially dilute its credit rating to the advantage of the peripheral economies			0
and @entity2 chancellor @entity222 has warned that @entity15 's role in saving the eurozone is " not unlimited			1
" " we must all resist the temptation to finance growth again through new debt , " she said			0
taken to its logical conclusion , this first scenario could reduce the eurozone to a @entity232 - @entity2 core , with the smaller @entity17 states attached			2
the consequences for the @entity12 economy would be calamitous , with governments defaulting on debt , capital controls imposed to prevent money from fleeing states on the verge of falling out of the eurozone and the likelihood of prolonged recession across @entity12			1
in addition , the very process of reverting to national currencies ( for which there is no road map ) would throw up a multitude of legal and contractual nightmares			0
and politically , the idea of @entity23 would be set back decades			0
the second course is that @entity12 muddles through while continuing to grope toward banking and fiscal integration			1
a compromise between @entity84 and the troika ( not so unlikely , given that 80 % of @entity84 want to stay in the eurozone ) would bring the country back from the edge of the abyss , though any meaningful recovery would be years away			1
the new @entity263 , due to come into effect next month as a permanent rescue fund , would recapitalize banks and help cool yields on vulnerable sovereign debt ( @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity74 )			0
its war chest of 500 billion euros would be bolstered as required			0
( @entity1 officials are already suggesting that it be allowed to borrow from the @entity95			0
) @entity222 would make token concessions to the " growth agenda " at the @entity12 summit in @entity275 at the end of this month			1
moves toward a banking union that would insure deposits , progress toward common tax policies , the decline of government debt and the emergence of the eurozone from recession would ease the pressure on governments struggling to find common ground			2
@entity222 has acknowledged that this is a " herculean task , " but it is in @entity15 's interest			2
very nearly 60 % of @entity2 exports stay inside @entity12 , and are competitive because they are priced in euros rather than deutsche marks			1
a collapse of the eurozone would savage the @entity2 economy			2
@entity222 has signaled her support for tougher @entity12 supervision of the eurozone banking industry , in an implicit criticism of the way the authorities in @entity305 underestimated the plight of @entity122 banks			1
that seems an important precondition for further @entity2 support			0
next year , @entity222 faces an electorate already impatient with @entity2 largesse for little return			0
until then , the argument goes , she ca n't afford to be seen to be generous			0
the third course would see a daring leap toward much closer integration : the " economic convergence " promised by @entity319 but never realized as governments allowed debt to rise and failed to liberalize their labor markets , supervise their banks or harmonize their tax systems			1
this is the mantra of @entity165 , who wants measures to stimulate growth and " imagination and creativity " to deepen financial union , such as a joint fund to pay down debt			0
there seems little prospect that such sudden and dramatic initiatives will gain the support of a @entity12 public no longer convinced of the benefits of deeper integration , nor of a @entity2 state unwilling to allow co-signers on its checking account			1
last week , @entity8 's grandson , @entity344 , said that his grandfather and @entity10 " wanted to build a strong and independent @entity12 , but now with the bailout funds and billions in rescues , we are demolishing it			1
" and he announced that he was leaving the party his grandfather had founded			0
the counter-argument of history is that the @entity12 banking crisis of 1931 " contributed directly to the breakdown of democracy " in @entity15 and across the continent , according to economists @entity357 and @entity359			2
writing in the @entity362 recently , they concluded , " the @entity23 was created to avoid repeating the disasters of the 1930s			0
it is time @entity12 's leaders -- and especially @entity15 's -- understood how perilously close they are to doing just that			1

a dysfunctional legacy hampers current eurozone woes
@entity84 will be key in determining @entity12 's future
possible scenarios include collapse or even a closer integration
