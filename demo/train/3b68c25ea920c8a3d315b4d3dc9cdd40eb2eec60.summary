-- consider for a moment how much @entity2 knows about you			0
depending on what services you use , it might have a record of every word or phrase you 've searched , locations you visit the most and where you are right now , your scheduled meetings and trips , and any other information buried in e-mails			1
some might find it unsettling that a $ 265 billion tech company in @entity18 knows them so intimately , but @entity2 is working hard to use that data to deliver more personalized products , not just targeted ads. on monday , @entity2 's predictive search feature @entity23 finally rolls out for @entity25 and @entity26 users as an update to the existing @entity29 app. the tool , which has been available for @entity32 devices since last summer , uses the wealth of data @entity2 has about an individual to serve up information it thinks he or she will find useful at the moment it 's most needed			1
on a typical weekday morning , @entity23 might automatically show the weather where you live , the traffic for your morning commute and the final @entity46 score from the night before			1
if you have a trip planned , it can display your flight status , when you need to leave to get to the airport , relevant currency conversions , directions to the hotel and nearby landmarks to visit at your destination			1
each nugget of information displayed is called a card , and the types of cards a person sees depends on what @entity2 services he or she chooses to tie into the app. your search history tells @entity2 now what you 're interested in , including what sports teams you follow , music you listen to , stocks you own and the news you are most likely to follow			1
you can train @entity23 over time by swiping away any cards that you do n't want			2
" we 're providing answers before you 've even asked the question , " said @entity74 , @entity2 's director of product development			0
using your phone 's location information , it can show train times when you get close to a station , concerts coming to a venue near you , photogenic landmarks in the vicinity , and suggest events in the area to check out			2
one of the most promising tie - ins is to @entity90			0
confirmation e-mails for restaurants , flights , hotel bookings , concerts or other ticketed events and shopping receipts are easily lost in the inbox			0
@entity2 now identifies these types of e-mails and turns them into cards , so you can track a package you 're waiting for or use your phone as a boarding pass at the airport			0
for now the most intriguing features are tied to travel , where @entity23 helps juggle reservations and also shares local information you might find in a guidebook			1
you can choose what services to use with @entity23 , so if the idea of @entity2 parsing your e-mails sounds like an invasion of privacy , you can limit it to just web history and location information			1
@entity2 already uses a lot of this data to serve ads in @entity90 and on search results			2
these types of apps are sometimes compared to personal assistants , someone working in the background to keep your schedule in check and make sure you have the information needed to coast through a busy day			0
there are other predictive assistant apps such as @entity134 and @entity135 that you can give access to your e-mail and calendar information , but for many , @entity2 products are already integrated into every part of their lives			2
according to @entity144 , @entity2 apps were four of the top five most downloaded apps across both operating systems in 2012 , coming in after @entity147			0
@entity2 is also in a unique position to know what information people are most interested in seeing and when they want it based on the giant volume of web searches processed by the search engine daily			2
according to @entity74 , only 16 % of the queries entered into @entity2 in a given day are searches it has never seen before			0
@entity2 now has been called a @entity157 competitor			0
like @entity161 's voice assistant , the @entity159 app already had voice search functions that let you ask questions in natural language , and both can answer back or show search listings when a question is beyond their pay grade			2
however , @entity157 is deeply integrated with the @entity170 operating system			0
@entity2 has been able to tie @entity23 into the @entity32 system , but it 's more limited on the @entity25 and @entity26			1
for the time being , @entity23 has no push notifications , which means you 'll have to open the search app to see what it has in the queue for you			1
@entity23 may not be the computer of the future that predicts your every need , but as people get more comfortable with their personal data being used to analyze them , predictive apps can expand their scope to collect even more data from tools such as wearable pedometers and other sensors			1
the more information they have about a person , the closer apps and smartphones can get to becoming actual personal assistants .			0

@entity23 predicts what information you are likely to want before you look it up
free update to @entity29 app uses information from your search history and e-mail
@entity23 is available for the @entity25 and @entity26 , 10 months after coming to @entity32
it shows weather , flight status , traffic estimates , scheduled appointments and sports scores
