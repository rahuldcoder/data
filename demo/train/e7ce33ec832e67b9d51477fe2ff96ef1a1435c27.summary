-- a proposed health curriculum in @entity3 , @entity4 , public schools has riled up some parents who say it starts teaching students about sex far too early			1
several hundred parents in the mountain state 's capital packed a school board meeting earlier this week to debate the 62 - page proposal			1
it includes four pages of charts listing what elements of human sexuality should be introduced at which grades			2
" ninety - five percent , if not 99 percent , is really , really good stuff , " @entity3 parent @entity20 told @entity23 's " @entity22			1
" but he added , " it 's not something we can attach 100 percent agreement with all of the committee members			0
" the proposed curriculum guide is part of a broad range of health courses that also teach nutriition , disease prevention , anatomy and environmental health			1
it would teach students as early as second grade that using anti-gay slurs is hurtful and teach children in older elementary grades about sexual harassment and abuse			2
students would be told as early as kindergarten to properly name body parts			1
the concept that people " can love people of the same gender and people of another gender " would be introduced in first grade , though homosexual relationships are n't discussed until fifth grade			0
fifth - graders also would learn that sexual intercourse " includes but is not limited to vaginal , oral , or anal penetration			0
" teachers would start discussing pregnancy , sexually transmitted diseases and drugs and alcohol with middle - schoolers , while high school students would learn about sexual orientation and the " legal implications " of some decisions			1
@entity69 , who has two elementary - age daughters and a third approaching kindergarten , said parents should be told " who decided this , when did they decide it and how did they decide it ? " " we really have n't seen where that age - appropriateness comes from , " he said			2
in addition , he said the district has not figured out how to implement the program			0
" there is n't any sort of implementation in place right now that says this is how we 're going to teach this , " @entity20 said			0
@entity91 , @entity3 's school superintendent , said the guide was drawn up by a committee that included parents , teachers and administrators			1
that committee used local practices and examined national guidelines , including those put out by the @entity101 , he said			0
" it establishes that between the ages of kindergarten through grade 4 , vocabulary would be introduced so a student has an understanding , " @entity91 said			0
" it does n't specifically say what would happen			0
" implementation plans will be developed later , he said -- and if parents object , he added , " they have a right to opt out			1
" the last school board meeting drew not only critics but supporters			0
and @entity119 , publisher of the @entity122 women 's magazine @entity123 and a former high school teacher , told @entity23 the standards sound defensible and age - appropriate			2
" it sounds like they are teaching body parts and things that are facts of life , " @entity119 said			1
" i feel more comfortable with my daughter learning about this in a classroom than from a boy in the hallway			0
