@entity0 -- @entity0 's @entity0 is well known for its dark past , from @entity3 to notorious 1960s gangsters the @entity4 , so it is no surprise that the area was also the birthplace of the creator of some of @entity12 's most famous scary movies			1
@entity13 is feted as the man behind " @entity15 , " " @entity16 , " " @entity17 " and " @entity18 " -- but before he made the move stateside , @entity13 was one of the biggest names in @entity22 's film industry , and traces of the director and his films can be found across his native city			1
the @entity27 has spent the past three years restoring nine of @entity13 's little - known -- and little - seen -- silent movies , which can now be viewed on the big screen for the first time in almost 80 years			1
to celebrate , join @entity1 on a tour of @entity13 's @entity0			1
humble beginnings @entity13 was born above his family 's greengrocer 's shop in @entity37 , east @entity0 in 1899			1
sadly , little trace remains of his early life there : his birthplace , at 517 @entity41 , was demolished many years ago to make way for a gas station and fast food outlet , though eagle - eyed visitors may notice a plaque on the spot			0
@entity13 knocks @entity49 off top film list as a young boy , an unknowing @entity13 was sent to the local police station with a note asking the officer on duty to lock him in a cell briefly to warn him what happened to people who misbehaved			0
unfortunately , the police station too has been knocked down , but information boards at the site retell the story			0
there is evidence of the director 's links with the area , though : two modern blocks of flats -- " @entity70 " and " @entity71 " take their names from his films , and a pub -- the @entity76 on the edge of @entity78 -- is named in his honor			1
but visitors wanting to catch a glimpse of the city 's most colorful tribute to the filmmaker need only step off the underground train : @entity37 's tube station -- on the @entity87 -- is decorated with mosaics featuring scenes from @entity13 's life and movies			1
@entity13 married his long - term collaborator @entity92 at @entity93 in upmarket @entity94 in december 1926			0
@entity95 is still celebrated in @entity96 every day at the imposing @entity97 near the @entity98			0
the couple lived close by , at 153 @entity100 in @entity101 , from 1926 until they and their daughter @entity103 left for @entity12 shortly before the outbreak of the @entity105			0
a blue plaque marks the building			0
the silent city @entity13 began his cinematic career as a designer , creating the title cards used in silent films , but within five years he was directing the movies themselves			1
for the rest of his life , he would use @entity0 as the setting for many of his films : some of the city 's most famous landmarks serve as backdrops to the action			1
" @entity0 was his base , even after he had moved to the @entity125 and was working in @entity12			0
it was the location for many of his films , and it was the subtext that ran through them , " said @entity126 , who runs a regular walking tour of @entity13 's @entity0 film locations			1
" he wanted to show the gory , nasty bits of the city , like the earthy cockney he always was , " she told @entity1			0
" he used @entity0 as the prism through which to show the evils of the world , just like @entity139 did			0
" @entity13 's first big hit came with " @entity141 , " ( 1927 ) the tale of a serial killer , subtitled " a story of the @entity145			2
" while many of the scenes were filmed in the studio , @entity150 , the embankment and @entity152 all make an appearance in the film			0
@entity155 , @entity13 expert at the @entity27 , recommends another location from " @entity141 " which she says crops up again and again , not only in his movies , but in his life : @entity159 , the headquarters of the @entity161 , the force responsible for the capital			1
" @entity13 was a regular visitor to @entity159 -- he would visit the ' @entity165 , ' the police 's crime museum for inspiration , to lap up plenty of macabre details for his films , " @entity164 told @entity1			1
the museum , which opened in 1875 , is home to a grisly selection of criminal evidence from notorious cases including those of @entity3 and @entity178			0
it is no longer open to the public , instead being used for police and forensic science training			0
another museum played a more direct role in @entity13 's final silent film -- and first ' talkie ' -- " @entity187 " ( 1929 )			0
the movie 's climactic chase scene takes place across the domed glass roof of the @entity193 's old reading room			0
" @entity187 " is one of @entity164 's top picks for film fans on the lookout for @entity0 links to @entity13 : other scenes take place in @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			1
tourist hotspots @entity164 also highlights 1936 's " sabotage , " one of the final movies hitch made before moving to the @entity125 in 1939			0
opening at the then - newly - built @entity208 ( now little more than a shell of a building ) , the film is a filmic feast of the city 's tourist hotspots : @entity201 , @entity214 and @entity215 all feature , alongside one of the director 's favorite restaurants , @entity220			1
the interior shots of @entity222 's were filmed in the studio			0
sadly , as with many of the locations linked to the director 's life , these have since been demolished , but at the site of the former @entity230 in @entity231 -- now transformed into an apartment complex -- a huge sculpture of @entity13 's head ( by artist @entity235 ) commemorates his time there			2
even after he had left the @entity22 , @entity13 frequently returned to @entity0 to film			2
interestingly , @entity164 points out that he was not actually present when one of the most memorable @entity0 scenes in his work was captured on film : the assassin 's fatal fall from the belltower of @entity245 in " foreign correspondent			2
" " deaths from a height are such an important hitchcockian motif , but because the war was on , @entity13 could not come to @entity0 , and so it was filmed by a second unit , " she said			2
the byzantine - style @entity253 cathedral would also play another role in @entity13 's life , some four decades later : it was the location of a memorial service for the director , following his death in 1980			2
for @entity126 , @entity13 's key @entity0 films are " @entity261 , " " the @entity262 , " and " frenzy , " all of which , she says , feature " some of the most beautiful buildings in @entity0 , " from @entity267 and the @entity268 to @entity269 and @entity270			1
" frenzy " in particular is rooted in its @entity0 location , the old fruit and vegetable market and the streets and pubs nearby : the @entity277 , in @entity278 , and the @entity279 in @entity280			0
it would be his last movie made in the city " ' frenzy ' was his homecoming film , " @entity164 told @entity1			0
" it brings him full circle , back to the @entity0 of ' @entity141			0
' " next steps if all this has wetted your appetite , then head to the @entity293 , which is currently showing an entire " @entity297 " season featuring all of the director 's surviving movies , including those early silent films			1
the @entity27 's @entity298 also offers the chance to view interviews , rarely - seen clips and other material linked to @entity37 's most famous son			1
you can also join an organized tour of @entity13 's @entity0			1
@entity126 's @entity306 , which runs three times a week and lasts for three hours , is illustrated with the original storyboards for " @entity261 " and excerpts from @entity126 's own interview with @entity13 himself			1
@entity312 also runs occasional @entity13 and @entity0 on film - themed tours -- its next " @entity314 : more than 39 steps ! " walk is planned for october 14			2
movie buffs who know where to look can follow in @entity13 's footsteps all over the city			2
just remember to check behind you once in a while ... @entity13 knocks @entity49 off top film list @entity13 : the man behind the movies @entity13 's classics remade in sticky tape			2

@entity13 is one of @entity0 's most famous *exports* : born , brought up in @entity37
little evidence of director remains in the city , but @entity0 is present in many of his movies
" @entity338 , " " frenzy " and " @entity261 " all feature key @entity0 landmarks
