-- the new @entity2 offensive in the @entity3 has both shaken the @entity4 and threatened the @entity6 minority with not only genocide , but also cultural extinction			1
in response the @entity9 early friday morning used airpower against @entity2 targets inside @entity13			1
this is the first use of force against @entity2 both since @entity2 rebranded from @entity16 in @entity13 and since the departure of @entity9 forces at the end of 2011			1
so what can @entity9 airstrikes accomplish ? airpower is incredibly potent when properly used , but nearly useless in the wrong situations			1
@entity2 will present both these alternatives in @entity13			1
put very simply , airpower is incredibly effective against an enemy who is on the offense			0
if an enemy — be it a person or a vehicle or a weapon system — is on the move and / or fighting , they create a " signature " that is easy to spot from the air			2
since there will be no @entity9 forces on the ground as target designators or air controllers , being able to see a target from the air will be crucial			1
so , a column of @entity2 trucks or — as seen early friday morning — a captured artillery piece firing against @entity4 positions , each make easy acquisition			1
against these targets , airpower is nearly invincible			0
one thinks of the devastation released over two decades ago by @entity9 airpower on the " @entity56 " ( albeit these forces were not attacking , but retreating — but the signature is the same )			1
so when president @entity59 talks about targeted airstrikes to protect @entity9 personnel in @entity62 or @entity63 , he is , in essence , saying that if @entity2 attacks toward these cities , we will use airstrikes on their then - vulnerable forces			1
note that the president did not say that airstrikes would be used to eject @entity2 forces from @entity73 or @entity74 or @entity75			2
for in densely populated cities like these , airpower has real limitations			0
an enemy in defensive positions , particularly in urban terrain , is very difficult to engage with airpower			1
even if the target can be hit , the possibility for collateral damage that causes civilian casualties is very real			0
and if the target is missed , the collateral damage can be exponentially higher , even catastrophic			0
so while mission creep is always a danger in any war , in this case the chances of it seem rather minimal			0
the president has chosen one means — airpower — and given it a mission at which it excels ; prevent enemy forces from attacking prepared positions , whether in @entity63 or @entity62			2
this mission is well within the capacity of @entity9 airpower			2
when and if unleashed , @entity9 warplanes can absolutely prevent @entity2 from moving against these two @entity13 cities			1
but reclaiming territory from @entity2 will be another matter altogether			0
this will require a unified @entity13 effort — @entity113 and @entity4 alike — under a new government with the will , legitimacy and resolve to accept the casualties that a ground offensive will require			2
we need only look at the @entity9 experience in @entity75 — almost 10 years ago now — to picture what this might look like			0
nor will @entity9 ground forces be joining in this endeavor			2
there is no — zero — appetite in the @entity9 public for such a commitment			0
to that end , we must hope that @entity13 remains on its constitutional timeline so that a new government can be formed and begin the long , hard task of regaining control over its territory			0
therefore , new @entity13 president @entity137 must charge the largest bloc in the @entity13 parliament with forming a government			0
join us on @entity142 / @entity141 .			0

@entity9 strikes @entity2 targets in @entity13 to stem the group *'s* *spread*
@entity148 : air power can be very potent when used properly
he says it works well to stop the enemy from offensive moves
@entity148 : air power often fails to *dislodge* forces from defensive positions
