@entity0 -- a top - secret program that collects phone records of @entity5 is legal , conducted properly and possibly could have helped detect a 9/11 hijacker had it been in place before the 2001 terrorist attacks , fbi director @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity2 's remarks at a @entity12 hearing led an effort by @entity15 administration officials and some in @entity16 to push back against a firestorm of criticism about domestic surveillance in the aftermath of classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs			1
civil liberties groups and legislators on the left and right are among critics condemning the secret programs under the @entity30 as government overreach beyond the intention and limits of the @entity34 originally passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			2
" it 's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state , collecting billions of electronic records on law - abiding @entity5 every single day , " rep. @entity37 of @entity38 , the ranking @entity39 on the judiciary panel , said thursday			1
claiming section 215 of the @entity34 " is being used to engage in a nationwide dragnet of telecommunications records " and that the government is relying too much to cover up what it 's doing through classified programs , @entity37 said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address " the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs			1
" two conservative republicans , sen. @entity58 of @entity59 and rep. @entity60 of @entity61 , announced plans for a lawsuit challenging whether a secret court order allowing the collection of phone records was constitutional			2
however , other legislators of both parties joined @entity2 in defending the programs that were disclosed through leaks of classified information			2
" this program does not target innocent @entity5 in any way , shape or form , " said @entity73 speaker @entity72 , an @entity75 @entity74			2
" these programs have helped keep @entity5 safe			0
they have enhanced our ability to go after terrorists who want to bring harm to the @entity5 people			0
" @entity88 sen. @entity87 of @entity89 -- emerging from a classified briefing by officials on the programs on thursday , including director of national intelligence @entity93 and @entity30 director gen. @entity95 -- said public perception of the government data mining was wrong			1
" it is misunderstood that @entity5 ' private information -- telephone calls and emails -- are being rummaged through by the government			0
that is not true , " @entity87 told reporters			0
" only when there is probable cause given with a court order by a federal judge can they go into the content of phone calls and emails in order to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot			0
" after an earlier briefing for the @entity118 , chairman @entity116 of @entity38 said it was wrong to describe the @entity30 programs as either monitoring or surveillance			2
not happening , " he said of either description			0
@entity127 chief : programs in adherence with @entity130 one of the programs , under @entity132 of the @entity34 , collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists			1
another under @entity138 of the @entity34 deals with computer activity and other information of foreigners			0
as explained by @entity2 and other security officials , the phone records only show the numbers involved and the date and duration of the call			0
any further information , such as what was said , requires federal court approval , they say			0
" if you are going to connect the dots on a 9 - 11 style event or hopefully prevent a 9 - 11 style event , you have to have dots in the box in order to connect , " @entity116 said			0
" so all of this is just that little bit of information they might need - a phone number to a phone number with no names attached			0
" @entity2 told the @entity12 that the secret programs have been conducted in adherence with the @entity130 and federal laws			0
" the legality has been ensured " by the @entity169 , and special federal courts set up to handle surveillance issues " ruled and monitored these programs and again , ensured the legality , " he said			1
he also explained how they might have helped detect 9/11 hijacker @entity175 before he and others carried out the attacks that killed almost 3,000 @entity5 in 2001			1
before the attacks , @entity175 was being monitored by intelligence agencies in the @entity180 , but they lost track of him , @entity2 said			0
meanwhile , authorities had the phone number of an @entity185 safehouse in @entity186 , he said , and learned after the 9/11 attacks that @entity175 had called it from @entity189			0
" if we had this program , that opportunity would have been there " to match the @entity186 phone number to the @entity189 number , he said			0
on wednesday , @entity95 made a similar argument at a @entity198 committee hearing , saying the covert programs helped prevent " dozens " of terrorist events			1
he was unable to provide details , but said thursday he was working on declassifying further information about the programs ' successes			0
@entity88 sen. @entity206 of @entity207 , who chairs the @entity208 , told reporters she expected @entity95 to have the additional information on monday			2
balancing boosting security , protecting privacy @entity206 also called for legislation that would prevent government contractors such as 29 - year - old @entity215 , who has admitted leaking the classified documents about the covert programs to the media , from having access to such sensitive information			1
while saying he could n't say much about a person under investigation , @entity73 spokesman @entity221 did tell reporters thursday that " the leaks themselves were very serious			1
" " they go right to the heart of our efforts to combat terrorism , to combat efforts by extremists who desire to attack the @entity5 and the @entity5 people , " @entity221 said			1
the @entity73 spokesman also reiterated @entity15 's support for programs he says have " helped thwart dozens of attacks			1
" " he believes in the tradeoffs that we have to make to pursue our security and protect our privacy , " @entity221 said of the president			1
" we have found ... we have the right balance , but ( @entity15 ) understands others may have a different opinion			1
like members of his national security team , the president has defended the @entity251 administration programs as necessary and claimed that there are more checks and balances on them than there were when he came to office in 2009			2
under his administration , legislative and judicial oversight of the @entity34 has been strengthened , @entity15 told reporters last week			2
@entity72 , however , said thursday that he was surprised the @entity73 " has n't stood up and made clear on an ongoing basis over this last week just how important these programs are			1
" @entity1 's @entity263 contributed to this report .			0

new : leaks go " to the heart of our efforts to combat terrorism , " @entity73 spokesman says
new : @entity15 believes the programs balance security , privacy issues
@entity127 director says surveillance programs possibly could have detected a 9/11 hijacker
