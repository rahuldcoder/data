the ubiquitous red envelopes will endure , but they will carry a new name			0
@entity2 is rebranding its 12 - year - old movies - by - mail service as @entity5 and adding video games to its catalog , @entity8 , the company 's ceo , announced sunday night			1
the web - streaming portion will continue to be called @entity2 , he wrote on the company 's blog			1
after the separation , people who subscribe to both services will have to log into two separate websites , @entity2 and @entity19 , to manage their movie queues and account information , @entity8 wrote			2
customer reviews and ratings from @entity2 will be ported to @entity5 for the launch , but after that , people will have to rate and search for movies on each site separately , he wrote			1
@entity5 's site currently presents a landing page that says it is " launching soon			1
" @entity31 did not offer a timeline for @entity5 's debut			1
@entity34 , the operations chief and 12 - year veteran of the company , will run the new mail - order arm			2
in addition to dvds and blu - ray discs , the new service will offer console games for @entity44 's @entity43 , @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity48 's @entity47 for an extra monthly fee			1
the change will put pressure on @entity52 , a competing service dedicated to subscription game mailings			0
" members have been asking for video games for many years , and now that dvd by mail has its own team , we are finally getting it done , " @entity8 wrote			1
responding to a question in the blog post 's comments , he wrote , " @entity65 discs will last a long time			0
" another person questioned whether @entity2 was setting the dvd business up to be sold off later and asked how long until that would happen			1
" a long time , " @entity8 replied			0
" we know the business better than anyone else			0
" @entity70 , which recently acquired @entity71 in a bankruptcy auction for $ 320 million , is believed to be unveiling a revamped movie - streaming service on friday			2
@entity2 also faces competition from @entity75 , @entity76 and an array of new entrants			2
@entity2 customers were incensed in july when the company announced that it would stop bundling the streaming service for free with dvd - by - mail plans , effectively increasing the price for some by as much as 60 %			1
@entity8 finally offered an apology , not for the price hike but for failing to clearly communicate why the change was being made			0
" it is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of dvd and streaming , and the price changes , " @entity8 wrote			0
i owe everyone an explanation			0
" @entity8 has worried for the last five years that @entity2 will fail to successfully adapt its business to growing opportunities , such as online video streaming , he wrote in a rare public admission for the savvy @entity2 co-founder			2
he said he hoped to avoid similar fates to @entity107 , the bookstore chain that filed for bankruptcy this year , or @entity110 , the dial - up internet king that is struggling to transform itself into an online media company after a nasty corporate breakup from @entity115 , which is the parent company of @entity116			0
" in hindsight , i slid into arrogance based upon past success , " @entity8 wrote			0
" both the @entity5 and @entity2 teams will work hard to regain your trust			1
we know it will not be overnight			0
" in a video explanation , he clarified the company 's reasoning for the changes , saying , " dvd and streaming were becoming more and more different , and we could do a better job for both services if we separated them			2
" while @entity2 is not going back on the price changes from earlier this summer , customers should not expect further increases , @entity8 wrote			0
in his response to a comment on the blog , he said the adjustment was designed to help @entity2 improve the quality of movies and tv shows available on the streaming service , which many say is lacking .			1
