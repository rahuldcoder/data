-- some 3.5 million people fled their homes in @entity3 , @entity4 , and elsewhere , the bone - dry landscape , blistering heat and choking dust storms unfit for growing and raising the crops and cattle they relied on to survive			2
thousands more , many of them children and seniors , could not escape , killed by an infection dubbed " dust pneumonia " and other illnesses tied not just to the extreme weather and poor living conditions but to massive , fast - moving dust clouds			1
those clouds and barren terrain across much of middle @entity21 gave this period of despair its name : the @entity25			1
there were suicides , there were bankruptcies , there were people scrapping for whatever they could find to live			2
and these were not overnight horror stories : they were repeated day after day and year after year , at a time when much of the @entity21 and world was already debilitated by the @entity36			2
" if you can imagine what 's happening now and multiply it by a factor of four or five , that 's what it was like , " said @entity37 , a @entity39 - based media producer who interviewed survivors of the 1930s ' environmental and economic disaster and penned a book , " @entity46			2
" " and it lasted for the entire decade			0
" from dry rivers to dead deer , drought 's impact felt everywhere nothing in @entity21 history can compare to that calamity of eight decades ago , including the historic drought now gripping much of the country			1
that does n't mean , though , there is n't considerable suffering and devastation now in most of the @entity21			0
or that dire conditions could well persist for several years , as they did during the 1930s -- compounding negative impacts of drought , thus ruining even more livelihoods and lives despite technological and agricultural advancements of recent years			1
" @entity77 holds all the cards , " said @entity75 , a climatologist with the @entity76			1
" you roll the dice ... every year			0
nothing will make you quote - unquote drought - proof			1
" this year , @entity83 helped alleviate the current drought in some locales , but not in most , and certainly nowhere near enough to put a big dent in a phenomenon that 's affected millions			1
is it happening again ? over 63 % of the contiguous @entity21 in early september was suffering moderate to exceptional drought , nearly twice the land affected a year ago , according to the @entity91			1
using july data , the @entity92 reported that @entity21 is in the midst of its most expansive drought since december 1956			1
the combination of dry conditions and extreme heat -- including hundreds of record - breaking temperatures this summer -- has been unbearable for many			0
the drought 's impact has been seen in ways big and small , from leaves falling early and lawns turning brown to farmers giving up and lakes drying up , exposing hundreds of dead fish			1
" it does look like a moonscape , " @entity75 said of parts of western @entity3 , where dirt drifts into mounds and soil climbs over fence posts			0
" there are some parts of the country where ( dire farming conditions ) have nothing to do with them failing to till over the soil , " as was commonly blamed for " dust storms " of the 1930s			0
@entity124 photos : @entity25 survivors , @entity127 , 1942 driving through southern @entity128 , @entity0 ireporter @entity129 saw heap after heap of chopped - down corn sacrificed by farmers who had conceded this year 's crop , hoping if anything to salvage some of the loss by selling off as cattle feed what did sprout up			1
dozens of farmers markets in @entity3 were without vendors months earlier than had been expected because their bounty was so meager , said @entity144 of the state 's @entity145 , a year after closing even earlier due to similarly hot , arid conditions			1
while consumers may be worried about rising food prices tied to the drought , many farmers have seen their incomes all but evaporate because crops wo n't grow -- finding even irrigated farmlands can not pump in enough moisture , given the rate it evaporates back into the atmosphere in high heat			1
it has n't been easier for those who raising cattle and other animals , at a time of scorched pastures and scanty , costly hay and other feed			1
ranchers have been forced to prematurely sell off their cattle , saying they had no other choice because it cost more to feed them than to keep them			0
@entity127 ranchers " liquidated " -- meaning slaughtered or sold off , without replacing them with newborns or new purchases -- 14 % of their livestock last year , said @entity176 , an @entity177 faculty member who works with ranchers and affiliated companies in that state			0
the only reason rates have n't been similarly high after this summer is because ranchers do n't have as many animals to sell , he said			0
families trying to make a living raising cattle have been especially hard pressed			0
take @entity187 of @entity188 , @entity189 , who sold 33 of his cherished cows ( leaving only a few behind ) for less than half what they might have earned before the drought			1
" they 're not just numbers on a computer , " @entity187 said			2
" they 're members of the family			2
" can it happen again ? so what can be done to prevent another @entity25 disaster ? rains from @entity83 might have made headlines , but they alone wo n't make a dent in the drought			1
ironically , the @entity25 era had wet spells , too -- including flash floods in the @entity210 -- though they did not alter the devastating equation much , according to @entity21 @entity145 meteorologist @entity212			1
what farmers and ranchers do have working in their favor , compared to the 1930s , are new tools , techniques and other developments that help them better manage droughts , storms and other harsh weather realities			1
photos : drought around the world @entity75 , with the @entity76 , rattles off several such changes -- from more effective soil preservation measures to hybrid seeds to the inception of center pivot irrigation			2
he adds , too , that things like cell phones and computers make it easier for farmers , ranchers and others to understand what 's coming , then adjust			1
and the most significant difference between the 1930s and today -- and the main reason for hope that it wo n't be as bad -- is time			0
the @entity25 era is generally defined as an eight - year stretch ; while parts of @entity3 and @entity4 are in the second year of drought , the rest of the @entity21 is in its first			1
in other words , there 's still a long way to go			2
if the precipitation picks up , " row farmers " cultivating crops like corn , soy beans and sorghum using modern farming practices should be able to recover next year			2
" if they have a normal rain pattern , it 's basically a zero recovery period , " said @entity257			0
" you are going from a ( devastated ) 2012 crop to normal			0
" but those raising livestock may feel the effects of this drought for longer , even if there 's more rain			2
some strained pastureland and hay fields may revive with above average , more sustained rainfalls than ordinary			0
but other lands may be a lost cause , with replanting the only way to save them			0
@entity176 called the next one to two months " critical , " as some rain soon may help save these lands so ranchers do not have to start from scratch			0
still , even if their pastures improve or hay prices drop , those who sold off many of their livestock in recent years likely can not afford to buy the same number back , and return to normal , anytime soon			0
" grazing and ranching are totally at the mercy of rain - fed crops and pastures , " said @entity75 , pointing especially to the susceptibility of grass and hay to a lack of moisture and excess of heat			0
" they just do n't control those factors at all			0
" if drought conditions do persist , they can have a steamroller effect			2
" the suns ' rays are more efficient ( when ) you have parched soils , " said @entity257 , the @entity145 meteorologist , adding that it becomes harder for new moisture to make an immediate impact			0
" these droughts , when they tend to go multiple years , it really starts to feed on itself , " adds @entity75			0
girl from iconic @entity25 photo : ' we were ashamed ' we have n't got there quite yet , but we could be if more precipitation does n't fall over the @entity210 and beyond			1
as they try to predict the drought 's future , meteorologists say they will look first to whether this fall and winter are wetter and cooler than last year , hoping that it will saturate soils and rivers and spur a wetter trend that continues into next spring and summer			2
as is , some states out west had two straight @entity330 winters that " tend to really suck you dry , " @entity75 explained			0
typically lasting a year or two , @entity330 is characterized by cooler than normal sea - surface temperatures in the central and eastern @entity333 that has a domino effect on global weather -- leading to more rainfall than normal in some locales and drought in others			2
" if we had a third consecutive @entity330 , there are some statistics that would be scary , " he added			0
" but the odds of @entity330 ( continuing ) are very small right now			0
" still , no one predicted practically a full decade of minimal rain , maximum heat during the @entity25 era either			1
the fact is , for all the forecasts and farming innovations , keeping one 's fingers crossed for change in the weather may be as useful as anything else			0
" right now , it 's just a question of @entity77 giving us a break , " said @entity176 , from @entity177			1
by the numbers : today 's drought vs. the @entity25 era			1

millions were affected and thousands were killed in the @entity366 era
experts say we 're a long way from a @entity25 repeat , but note major *challenges*
new tools and techniques have made it easier for farmers to adapt , with limits
as one climatologist *specilizing* in drought *mitigation* says , " @entity77 holds all the cards "
