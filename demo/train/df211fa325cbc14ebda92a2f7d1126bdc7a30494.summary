-- @entity2 's fantasy novel " @entity5 " could at last become a movie or miniseries			1
the 1987 bestseller is being developed by @entity7 as a longform project , along with a scripted drama series based on the comic " @entity10 " and two high - concept movie projects			1
the network is set to announce all the titles later today at its upfront presentation in @entity15			0
@entity16 ( " @entity22 " ) and @entity17 ( " @entity23 " ) will pen the " @entity21 " script , with @entity16 and @entity19 as executive producers			1
" @entity21 " is a rarity among @entity2 's early works : a stand - alone novel that has n't been previously adapted into a live - action feature			1
in fact , among @entity2 's pre- 1990 books that were first published under his own name , only his fantasy titles ( " @entity5 , " " @entity31 " and the " @entity33 " books ) have n't yet been adapted , though all have been in development at one point or another			1
and given @entity39 's success with its fantasy hit " @entity42 , " the timing for " @entity21 " could n't be better			1
" @entity21 " takes place in fictional realm of @entity45 and follows a teenage prince who is falsely accused of murdering his father , the king			1
imprisoned in a high tower , the prince must figure out a way to escape , clear his name , and confront the devious and powerful wizard who is responsible for his father 's death			1
though " dragon " was aimed at younger readers than most of the author 's books , the story also has plenty of characteristically dark touches			2
the tale also has some overlapping mythology with @entity2 's " @entity33 " novels , including sharing a villain ( @entity65 ) who was also in one of @entity2 's most beloved works , " @entity68			1
" in addition , @entity7 is developing a drama series called " @entity71			2
" based on the comic " @entity10 " from @entity72 , " @entity71 " is about a cop who meets a violent demise but returns as a ghost to close his last case			0
the only person who can help him is a socially awkward man who is realizing for the first time that his hallucinations may not be all in his head			0
@entity83 ( " @entity82 , " " @entity84 " ) and @entity85 ( " @entity86 , " " @entity87 " ) will write			0
@entity83 , @entity88 and @entity89 will executive produce the project from @entity91			0
another movie / mini project in the works at @entity7 is " @entity94 , " from @entity95 and @entity96 ( " @entity97 , " " @entity98 " )			1
@entity99 : " when , without warning , modern forms of power and technology become a thing of the past , @entity105 , and the world at large , becomes a place where magic rules and life as we know it is turned upside down			0
" @entity111 and @entity112 will produce			0
@entity7 is also developing a movie called " @entity114			2
" @entity122 : " when a powerful earthquake hits @entity116 and opens up a chasm bigger than the @entity118 , it reveals an enormous hidden ocean lying deep beneath the earth 's crust			2
billionaire adventurer @entity123 works with the government to take an advanced nuclear submarine down to explore it and discovers more than he ever could have imagined			2
" @entity126 ( " @entity130 " ) , @entity127 ( " @entity128 " ) and @entity129 ( " @entity131 " ) will write and executive produce this one from @entity112			0
