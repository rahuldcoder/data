editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- getting into @entity19 was one of the weirdest processes @entity9 has ever dealt with			1
after we went back and forth with their representatives for months , they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the @entity26 in @entity27			1
just before our departure , they suddenly said , " no , nobody can come			2
" then they said , " ok , ok , you can come			2
" but they already knew we were journalists , and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you 're supposed to be a tourist you go to jail			2
we do n't like jail			0
and we 're willing to bet we 'd hate jail in @entity19			1
but we went for it			0
the first leg of the trip was a flight into northern @entity45			0
at the airport , the @entity19 consulate took our passports and all our money , then brought us to a restaurant along with our tour group			1
all the other diners left , and these women came out and started singing @entity19 nationalist songs			1
we were thinking , " look , we were just on a plane for 20 hours			0
ca n't we just go to bed ? " but this guy with our group who was from the @entity60 told us , " everyone in here besides us is secret police			0
if you do n't act excited then you 're not going to get your visa			0
" so we got drunk and sang songs with the girls			0
the next day we got our visas			0
a lot of people we had gone with did n't get theirs			0
we flew into @entity19 that night			1
we were supposed to have three days before the games started , but as soon as we got on the ground they told us , " the games are happening now			0
" we went straight to the stadium , and there were 40,000 people in the stands , portraying the history of the @entity19 revolution with flip cards			1
on the playing field before them , about 60,000 people did wild synchronized - gymnastics routines			1
the 15 of us who made up the audience watched from a marble dais			1
we were the only spectators			1
fifteen audience members for a 100,000 - man extravaganza			1
see the rest of the vice guide to @entity19 the next day , our grand tour began			1
we went to the @entity94 , which comprises 2,000 rooms carved into the bottom of a mountain			0
the displays are all gifts from different world leaders			0
@entity101 gave @entity102 a train			0
@entity104 also gave @entity102 a train			0
he got hunting rifles from communist @entity108 's @entity107 and @entity110 's @entity109 and all the other eastern - bloc guys			1
@entity112 famously gave @entity113 a basketball signed by @entity115			0
perhaps the weirdest thing about @entity19 is that they genuinely do n't seem to know that the rest of the planet hates and fears them			1
they believe ( or maybe they really convincingly lie about believing ) that the whole world admires and envies them and that they 're the true light of socialism and @entity128 , which is their leader 's philosophy of @entity132 self - reliance			2
as the days went on , @entity19 presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters			1
being there was like being nowhere else on the planet			2
are we glad that we got into @entity27 and were able to document it ? yes			0
but are we even gladder that we made it out ? watch our documentary on the trip and try to guess the answer .			0

a @entity9 crew gets into @entity19 after months of *negotiation*
their " strange " tour *included* a 100,000 - man show at which they were among 15 spectators
@entity9 *founder* @entity152 says it was " like being nowhere else on the planet "
