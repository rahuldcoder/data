@entity0 -- in the third case in the last two weeks , more than 100 passengers aboard a troubled boat required rescue in the waters between @entity7 and @entity8			1
on wednesday , @entity7 authorities plucked 162 passengers from a boat in distress located south of @entity8			1
the rescued passengers were taken to @entity7 's @entity14 for initial security , health and identity screening			1
the authorities declined to say whether the people on the rescued boat were seeking asylum			2
this followed after a boat capsized near @entity14 carrying an estimated 200 people seeking asylum on june 22 , and another boat accident occurred on june 27			2
the number of deaths from these accidents are unclear , as authorities did not know how many people had been aboard the vessels			0
dozens are believed to have died			0
although it is n't clear whether the most recent incident involved asylum seekers , the issue of possible refugees boarding rickety boats to make the treacherous voyage to @entity7 has turned into an explosive political issue			1
the question for nations is what to do with people seeking help ? the world 's wealthiest nations like @entity7 or the @entity48 are not always the most welcoming for potential refugees			1
a @entity50 high commissioner for refugees report released last year described " a time of rising anti-refugee sentiment in many industrialized " countries			1
in @entity7 , the perception is that , " everyday , we 're being flooded by boat people who are cheating the system , " said @entity55 , ceo of @entity56 in @entity7			1
they 're jumping the queue			0
everyday , the news is reporting another boat has arrived and another boat has arrived			0
it 's feeding this idea that we 're being flooded			2
" the number of asylum seekers in @entity7 and @entity72 decreased by 9 % in 2011 compared with the previous year , according to the latest report by @entity74			1
@entity55 said aslyum seekers have turned into a " political football " and " easy scapegoats " without much understanding of why they embark on such dangerous journeys			1
@entity7 is not alone in grappling with the asylum issue , which is often unpopular and politically divisive			1
read how the @entity7 @entity81 voted following the @entity85 , waves of @entity84 asylum seekers journeyed in boats to @entity88 nations such as @entity89 and @entity90			1
this resulted in a 87 % increase in asylum requests in the area in 2011 compared with the previous year , according to @entity74			1
in the western hemisphere , vessels carrying @entity97 migrants have traveled across to the @entity48 -- one boat sank in the @entity100 , killing at least 11 people in june			0
but the notion that most asylum seekers flock to developed , wealthy nations differ from the statistics shown by @entity74			1
eighty percent of the world 's refugees are hosted in developing countries , which the agency described as a " deep imbalance in international support			1
" @entity112 hosts the most refugees with 1.7 million			1
the second and third leading countries to host refugees at the end of 2011 were @entity117 and @entity118			1
the 2011 report is the most recent one available by @entity74 and may not reflect the current crisis in @entity118			0
the vast majority of refugees remain within their region of origin -- 17 % live outside their home region , according to @entity74			1
" geography does play a big part of it , " said @entity55 , on why asylum seekers ended up in countries like @entity112 and @entity117			1
people are seeking the easiest and quickest escape to countries where " immigration channels are available , " he said			2
an asylum seeker is a person who wants sanctuary in another country and applies for the right to be recognized as a refugee			2
a refugee is recognized as a person who was forced to flee his or her country because of persecution , war or violence , according to @entity74			0
