-- as the car industry suffers declining sales and excess production , luxury brand @entity1 is making a billion dollar bet on a niche slice of the market			1
@entity1 , the luxury car brand owned by @entity8 , is increasing its production of premium compact cars by investing in a state - of - the - art plant in @entity12			1
@entity1 is battling its luxury brand competitors , @entity14 and @entity15 , for market share of the chic , small , car market -- a style which appeals to a younger demographic			1
the company 's @entity21 plant , an hour from @entity23 , has been rolling out production of its b - class compact car since march			1
@entity27 , the plant manager in @entity21 , said the move was a reaction to a change in the customer base : " it has become younger and they want more sporty , more attractive cars , " he said			0
" with this model i think we can meet all the demands that the customer expects from a premium brand			0
" @entity1 set up in @entity12 after looking at locations where it could increase its capacity but keep costs down			1
" there was a long evaluation process at the beginning of this project phase , " @entity27 said			0
" we had 15 different sites to select from and there were a lot of different criteria , including the logistics costs and the availability of a qualified workforce			0
" @entity1 follows @entity55 's @entity15 unit , which opened its first car plant in @entity12 in 1994			1
the country 's appeal lies in its skilled labor and low costs			1
research from professor @entity62 , head of the @entity63 at the @entity64 , shows car plant workers in @entity12 are paid a fifth of their @entity68 neighbors			2
@entity12 also has cheaper taxes and less regulation than its neighbor , according to @entity62			0
he estimates the cost of making a @entity74 in @entity12 is around $ 2500 cheaper than making it in @entity68			2
according to @entity8 , these savings per car could be even higher , with @entity27 estimating overall production costs at 30 % less in the @entity12 plant			1
@entity80 , an auto analyst and director of research at @entity83 , is unsurprised at @entity1 's move			2
" the main failing of the @entity87 industry is it has n't really adjusted its production footprint to the underlying financial or economics of the industry , " he said			0
" consumers are getting cars cheaper in real terms and getting cars with more content , but at the same time labor costs and raw materials are going up , so somewhere something has to be squeezed -- and at the moment that is the bottom line for the car makers , " he added			2
@entity8 's hope is that the plant will reduce production costs but also -- given new innovations and technologies -- improve productivity and efficiency			2
@entity80 believes it 's a good strategy for saving on production costs , " but the actual success of it is contingent on the success of the cars , " he said			0
" it 's about what the consumer wants , and the consumer wants smaller premium cars , so in that sense @entity1 is definitely doing the right thing			0
