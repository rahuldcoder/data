-- a senior @entity2 auditor has warned that local government debt is " out of control " and could spark a bigger financial crisis than the @entity6 housing market crash			1
@entity8 said his accounting firm , @entity9 , had all but stopped signing off on bond sales by local governments as a result of his concerns			1
" we audited some local government bond issues and found them very dangerous , so we pulled out , " said mr @entity8 , who is also vice-chairman of @entity2 's accounting association			1
" most do n't have strong debt servicing abilities			0
things could become very serious			0
" the @entity20 , rating agencies and investment banks have all raised concerns about @entity2 government debt			1
but it is rare for a figure as established in the @entity2 financial industry as mr @entity8 to issue such a stark warning			1
" it is already out of control , " mr @entity8 said			1
" a crisis is possible			0
but since the debt is being rolled over and is long - term , the timing of its explosion is uncertain			0
" local government debts soared after 2008 , when @entity37 loosened borrowing constraints to soften the impact of the global financial crisis			1
provinces , cities , counties and villages across @entity2 are now estimated to owe between @entity45 and @entity46 ( $ 1.6tn and $ 3.2tn ) , equivalent to 20 - 40 per cent of the size of the economy			2
last week , @entity49 cut @entity2 's sovereign credit rating , in the first such move by an international agency since 1999			2
on tuesday , @entity53 's cut its outlook for @entity2 's rating from positive to stable			2
local governments are prohibited from directly raising debt , so they have used special purpose vehicles to circumvent these rules , issuing bonds under the vehicles ' names to fund infrastructure projects			1
investment companies owned by local governments sold @entity65 of bonds in the first quarter of 2013 , more than double the total for the same period last year			2
such an increase would normally be expected to boost the economy , but @entity2 's growth unexpectedly slowed to 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2013			0
mr @entity8 said many local governments had invested in projects from public squares to road repairs that were generating lacklustre returns , and so were relying on financing rollovers to pay back their creditors			1
" the only thing you can do is issue new debt to repay the old , " he said			0
" but there will be some day down the line when this ca n't go on			0
" mr @entity8 added that he grew alarmed when smaller towns and counties discovered that investment vehicle bonds were an easy way to raise financing			2
" this evolution was quite frightening , " he said			0
" @entity2 has more than 2,800 counties			0
if every county issued debt , it could lead to a crisis			0
it could be even bigger than the @entity6 housing crisis			1
" @entity37 has taken steps to control bond issuance by the local governments ' investment companies			1
in december , the finance ministry barred them from injecting public assets such as hospitals and schools into the special purpose vehicles they use to sell bonds			0
bonds issued by government - owned investment companies almost always receive top - tier credit ratings from domestic agencies because they are seen as being guaranteed by the provinces and cities that back them			0
but mr @entity8 puts little faith in official guarantees , saying @entity9 only audited bonds if it was very clear that borrowers were able to make repayments : " when the time comes , it wo n't be the government that assumes responsibility			1
it will be the accounting firms and the banks that do			0
" @entity9 's caution is an example of how an elite group of @entity2 accounting firms are trying to establish reputations as responsible , well - managed entities capable of challenging the global @entity130 in the industry			2
@entity9 has been the most aggressive @entity2 firm in expanding abroad and is now planning a move into @entity133			2
