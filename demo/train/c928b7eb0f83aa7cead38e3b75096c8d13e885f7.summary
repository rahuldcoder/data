-- as we head into a workweek that ends with a federal holiday on friday , you can expect the usual : newspaper , television and @entity8 advertisements touting special sales and slashed prices on selected items			2
@entity12 has become an annual opportunity for merchandisers -- many of them see the holiday as a chance to get a jump on @entity20 , the day - after - @entity21 bacchanalia of bust - down - the - doors sales pushes			0
it 's hard to blame the merchants			1
the economy has been dismal			0
anything that might bring shoppers into stores is seen as a plus			0
but before the @entity12 promotions kick into high gear , perhaps we might take a moment for a different suggestion about how to commemorate the day : make a note to yourself			0
make a promise to do what you can , whenever you can , to pay a visit to an unforgettable @entity41 place : @entity42 , just across the @entity43 from @entity44			1
more than 300,000 souls have found their final resting places in that cemetery			1
anyone who wishes to visit is always welcome			1
it is a short distance from the popular tourist attractions on the @entity51			2
if you are at the @entity53 and are in the mood for a walk , all you need do is circle behind the monument to mr. @entity58 , cross the street and head for the @entity61 that spans the @entity43 , then take a stroll along the pedestrian lanes that are on either side of the bridge			0
you emerge in @entity66 , where the broad , boulevard - like @entity67 leads to the entrance of @entity42			1
once you are inside , all is still			0
the beauty of the place , and the knowledge of why it is there , can take your breath away			2
there are 624 acres of lawns , gardens and towering trees that are hundreds of years old , but as gorgeous as all of that is , they are n't what overwhelm you			2
the sight of those hundreds of thousands of headstones , each honoring a military veteran or a member of the military who died while serving , is what has the power to render you silent and humbled			2
some parts of the cemetery draw large and constant crowds : the @entity95 , the eternal flame where @entity97 is buried			0
but for me , the best way to spend time at @entity42 is just to set off on a walk along the many paths that meander through less - visited portions of the grounds			1
you can walk for hours and never pass the same headstone twice			0
to stop and read the names on those headstones , and the dates , and to think about the service each of those departed soldiers , sailors , aviators and @entity114 gave to the nation where the rest of us now live and breathe ... to do that is to remind yourself of what duty entails			0
each person who comes to @entity42 takes his or her own memories home			1
there are moments that can be surprising to a first - time visitor			0
a distance from the always - well - attended grave of president @entity97 is another resting place that seldom has many people around it : that of @entity133 of @entity134 , the only person in the nation 's history to serve both as president of the @entity41 ( 1909 - 1913 ) and chief justice of the @entity140 ( 1921 - 1930 )			1
sometimes you will find yourself the only visitor there			0
i always make a point of stopping at the grave of @entity148 , the most decorated combat soldier of @entity149 ; his headstone is no different or more ornate than the other hundreds of thousands on the grounds , a soldier among soldiers			0
and , since 2003 , there has been the grave of an old friend and wonderful , generous colleague : @entity159 , the enlisted man whose cartoons in @entity161 made him beloved to the soldiers with whom he served in the @entity149 , and who went on , after the war , to become as fine a newspaper editorial cartoonist as ever lived			0
a visitor will feel especially moved when , across a patch of grass , he catches sight of one of the between 27 and 30 new burials that take place on an average day			2
@entity42 remains a working cemetery ; it is a place , in the words of the cemetery 's own defining statement , " where dignity and honor rest in solemn repose , " and that touches you most deeply when you see the newly arrived family of a veteran standing with bowed heads at another fresh grave site			1
you may not get to @entity42 on @entity12 this week , but if you promise yourself to visit one day , you will never regret it			1
the cemetery is open to the public every day of the year			0
it opens promptly at 8 a.m. during these fall and winter months it closes at 5 p.m. , and from april through september it stays open until 7 p.m. whatever burdens you may be carrying in your own life , whatever problems may be weighing you down , a few hours walking the quiet pathways of @entity42 will remind you of the sacrifice and service of people you never met , people who wanted the country to endure so that new generations could live , and hope to prosper , and strive to enjoy			1
to visit @entity42 is to understand anew the true meaning of an ancient phrase : paying our respects			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : there 's a place in @entity44 that is n't a top tourist spot
he says @entity42 is a place all @entity41 should visit
more than 300,000 are bured at @entity42 , *including* the famous
@entity204 says to visit @entity42 is to realize the meaning of serving your country
