-- last weekend at a party , i noticed a toad - like man attaching himself to a beautiful , talented friend of mine			1
not only was she way out of his league , looks-wise , but as i eavesdropped i discovered he was one of those dudes who delivers endless monologues instead of engaging in actual conversations			1
too many women are afraid to say , " no , " says author			1
ladies , i think we 've all been stuck with that guy			1
now it was my friend 's turn			1
i could tell by her stunned look of horror that she wanted nothing to do with him , but she seemed frozen			2
my pal @entity23 and i tried to intervene			2
" let 's go get some cake , " we suggested , physically pulling her from his side			2
her relief was short - lived as he tracked her down and reattached himself to her hip			1
watching her go through this made me think back on how many times i 've been afraid to say no. maybe " afraid " is the wrong word , but i 've spent hours worrying about offending men who would 've had no problem offending me if the situation were reversed			1
so i was thrilled when a copy of the hilarious book , " @entity39 : how to keep @entity41 and @entity42 " landed on my doorstep			1
as the title suggests , @entity43 is about learning to not only say no , but to embrace no , something women seem to have an inexplicably harder time doing than men			1
i shot off an email to author @entity50 asking her why we womenfolk find it so painful to blow - off a troll			1
" the psycho - sexual - societal bulls -- t that makes women be such wimps in the face of an odious man is in our dna			1
and young women often make the dreadful mistake of thinking everyone has to like them , " she fired back			1
the @entity0 : 13 woman you 're dating is a loser " i believe that some dumb guy bugging you is a great moment to really march out a lie , " she continues			2
" i mean , really , who goes around harassing strangers ? say , ' i have herpes			2
' say , ' i am a hermaphrodite			2
' say any damn thing you want to say but get him out of your face			2
do n't give chunks of it to this kind of dude ! " the @entity0 : i 'm just not that into anyone anymore but for some guys -- and , let 's face it , girls , too -- the word " no " can have an opposite effect , acting as an aphrodisiac			1
@entity50 says , " human beings want what they do not and can not have			0
" but sometimes you mean it ! in that case , a persistent leghumper should be ignored , or reported to the cops if he gets stalky			0
it 's your door , your cell			0
and , if it gets too bad , try 911 , " she advises			0
" you would n't let anyone else harass you like that , would you ? " the @entity0 : are these dating habits cute or crazy ? okay , so how about the @entity109 -- the cute guy who wants to " hang out , " but never seems to make any plans			0
" no hanging out , ever , " @entity50 insists			0
" if the guy ca n't think up an interesting date and find $ 40.00 bucks for a burrito and movie , no go			0
dating should never be ' hanging out			0
' save that for marriage			0
" the @entity0 : how to deal with ambiguous dater how about dumping someone , i asked			0
how do you do that nicely ? " i am not the woman to ask if you want kindly , " @entity50 replied			0
" but , i do know this , keep the tone friendly			1
the less you imbue language with strong emotion , the better			1
i once said , ' dude , it was way fun and i learned lots			0
but you yelled @entity132 ! during sex			0
' that happened to me , by the way			0
" hey , wait a minute			0
i once said yes to that guy too ! the @entity0 : how to know when it 's time to dump him @entity139 all rights reserved			0
