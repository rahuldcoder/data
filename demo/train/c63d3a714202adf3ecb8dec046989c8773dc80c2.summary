-- @entity1 announced sunday that it has developed cars that drive themselves automatically in traffic , and that it has been testing them on the streets of @entity7 for months			1
it might seem like an unusual project for @entity1 , but it could actually have big benefits			2
we 're not just talking about cars running @entity11			2
this is the stuff of science fiction			0
the only accident that has occurred so far : one of the cars was rear - ended by a driver at a stop light			1
human error ! the vehicles have been tested on 140,000 miles of @entity7 road , from @entity21 to @entity22			1
each car is manned during the tests			0
one person sits in the driver 's seat , ready to take control of the vehicle instantly by grabbing the wheel or touch the brake should something go wrong with the system			0
the person in the passenger 's seat is an engineer who monitors the software operations on a computer			0
@entity1 ( @entity1 ) hired engineers who previously participated in competitions and races involving automated cars -- important turning points in the development of the technology , which has been coming into its own since around 2005 according to the @entity46			1
if your first concern is one of safety , @entity1 would argue that you 're going about it all wrong			2
safety is one of the the project 's purposes			0
@entity1 believes that the technology could nearly half the number of automobile - related deaths because computers are supposedly better at driving than humans in the right circumstances			1
there are other hypothetical pluses , too			0
the vehicles ' instant reaction time and 360 - degree awareness would allow them to drive closer together on the highway than humans can , reducing traffic congestion			1
they could be more careful when operating the gas , reducing fuel consumption			0
but the biggest benefit for @entity1 would be the hour or so of daily commute time the car owner would save			2
instead of driving , he or she could either be productive or entertained in the vehicle , doing work on a @entity82 ( @entity81 ) connection or watching television			0
@entity1 does n't say it explicitly , but @entity85 was quick to note that this time could be spent using @entity1 products and absorbing @entity1 - run advertising			1
the most optimistic projections put this technology at least eight years away from market , though			1
legal hassles are among the myriad problems ; all of the current traffic laws assume that a human driver is present in the vehicle			2
do you think this technology will eventually be deployed , or is it just a pipe dream for @entity102 and @entity103 ? let us know in the comments			0

@entity1 has developed cars that drive themselves automatically in traffic
only one accident has occurred during testing so far and it was human error
@entity1 believes that technology could half the number of automobile - related deaths
optimistic projections put this technology at least eight years away from market
