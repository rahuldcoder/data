" are you scared when you have to go back to the mountain at night ? " it 's a not a question guides at a museum would usually be asked , but it 's happened to those at the outdoor @entity7 and cultural village in @entity9 , @entity10 's northernmost and second - largest island			1
the museum is dedicated to the culture of the @entity14 people , an ethnic group that not many -- even in @entity10 itself -- know much about			1
for weary guides at the museum , who live close to the museum in @entity20 , an hour 's drive from the city of @entity23 ( but not in primitive huts on the hillside ) , being able to tell visitors about their unique heritage and language is worth the occasional muddleheaded question			0
brutal hunting methods the @entity14 people are the indigenous inhabitants of @entity9			1
they 're also present on @entity31 , the island off the east coast of @entity34 , as well as northern @entity35 , @entity10 's biggest island			1
meeting a modern day @entity14 is n't common			2
estimates put the population of @entity14 at around 24,000 , and finding any who can speak the critically endangered language fluently is harder still : the @entity40 puts the number of native speakers at just 10			1
located outside the small town of @entity20 ( itself an @entity14 word meaning " place with many horseflies " ) , the museum is a re-creation of an @entity14 village on the shores of @entity50			1
visitors are immediately greeted by a 30 - foot wooden statue of a bearded @entity14 chief			2
from this stoic totem they can stroll among a series of thatched houses and botanical gardens , getting a glimpse of @entity14 traditions stretching back about 1,000 years			0
museum staff with @entity14 heritage host regular displays of traditional mouth harp ( known as a " mukkur " ) playing , singing and dancing			0
they also explain the ways simple homes were decorated and colorful clothing was made from the natural materials of the areas , from bark to animal hide ( including some natty salmon - skin boots )			0
the @entity14 of centuries ago had an oral tradition			0
animistic beliefs and worship of fire dominated daily life and @entity14 culture			2
numerous rituals were enacted before younger @entity14 were allowed to take on the rugged landscape of @entity9 on hunts or fishing trips			0
the area 's major fauna , like bears and wolves were revered , yet hunting was the norm ( some visitors may be put off by the caged brown bears kept on the site that can be fed biscuits for 100 yen , or less than a dollar ) and deer could be hunted			0
using techniques that might seem brutal by today 's attitudes to animal rights , herds would be chased off a cliff before being clubbed to death			0
@entity106 life for @entity14 if survival in @entity9 was harsh centuries ago , life for modern day @entity14 in @entity10 has not been easy either			1
the @entity110 government did not formally recognize the @entity14 as indigenous to @entity10 , with a distinct language and culture , until 2008 , while the westernization of @entity10 in the @entity116 era from 1868 to 1912 lead to greater integration with mainstream @entity110 culture			1
" @entity14 are in difficult economic and social position , " says @entity119 , a former professor of the @entity121 of @entity10 and a scholar of indigenous ethnic groups			1
" twice the number of @entity14 are on social welfare compared to the majority @entity110 population			1
education levels are much lower and they have economic restraints			0
" while the museum and recreated village presents a vivid reconstruction of @entity14 life , @entity119 thinks that more typical museums can do better to link tradition and heritage to the modern day @entity14 life			1
" many @entity14 are also reluctant to say they are @entity14			0
it 's a problem of discrimination that lies under the surface , " says @entity119			0
@entity141 moves to raise awareness however there are signs that the @entity110 government may be making an effort to understand the challenges faced by the country 's minority groups			2
in august last year it was reported that first nationwide survey of discrimination against @entity14 people would take place in 2015			2
educating the public is part of the mission of the museum and plans are in place for a new , more modern @entity14 cultural center on the other shore of @entity50 in time for the @entity161 in 2020			0
according to @entity119 debate continues over the emphasis of the new center			0
" should it continue to highlight the @entity14 culture in a historical context and be in danger of appearing irrelevant or should it do what the @entity170 has done for @entity172 and show the situation for @entity14 today ? " he asks			2
for now visitors to @entity20 's @entity7 can get a glimpse into the rugged life lived by the area 's indigenous inhabitants while modern @entity10 tries to find a comfortable place for their cultural legacy			1

@entity7 is a re-creation of an outdoor village of @entity10 's indigenous people
there are about *25,000* ainu people but only about 10 @entity14 speakers
they lead a relatively hard life compared to other @entity110 people today
