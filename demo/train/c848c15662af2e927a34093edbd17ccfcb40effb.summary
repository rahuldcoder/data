@entity0 -- now that president @entity2 has broken his promise to take executive action on immigration , and put off the thorny issue until after the midterm elections -- and i predict , for the remainder of his presidency -- many immigration reform advocates are angry , surprised and disappointed			1
i 'm none of those things			0
here 's my take : when it comes to @entity2 and immigration , keep your expectations low			1
despite what he says , do n't make the mistake of thinking that he actually supports legalizing the undocumented			0
finally , whatever he says , do n't assume it 's the truth			0
when it comes to immigration , @entity2 has a long trail of half - truths and broken promises			1
in july 2008 , the presidential candidate told the @entity33 that , if elected , he would make the issue a top priority and address it within the first 100 days			2
@entity39 officials then moved the goal line to , well , the first term			0
that did n't happen either			0
from 2009 to 2011 , @entity2 told supporters that he could n't curb deportations because he was " not a king			1
" yet , in 2012 , eager to re-engage @entity46 voters for his reelection , @entity2 summoned his inner monarch when he unveiled " @entity49 , " which gives undocumented young people a temporary reprieve from deportation and work permits			1
in 2013 , @entity2 did another about - face and returned to his rhetoric about how he could n't act alone to stop deportations			1
he also gave half - hearted support to the @entity58 immigration bill , which would militarize the border and only legalize about half of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the @entity62			1
now , we 're in another election year , and @entity2 is back to cynically using the promise of immigration reform to get @entity46 voters to turn out			1
he dangles it like a carrot in front of a donkey pulling a cart			0
speaking in the @entity73 on june 30 , @entity2 bemoaned inaction by the @entity75 - controlled @entity39 and promised to take executive action before the end of summer			1
lawmakers urge @entity2 to work with @entity79 on immigration well , summer is over , and @entity2 is backing out of the deal			1
some on the left are finally getting the message that @entity2 is not their amigo			1
@entity86 , the managing director for @entity87 we dream , an advocacy group for undocumented students , told the @entity91 : " the president 's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the @entity46 and immigrant community			2
" for @entity2 , the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue but what the immigration issue can do for him			1
it 's no surprise that some on the left have realized that they have to do for themselves			0
just a few hours before @entity2 's retreat , i was having breakfast in @entity107 with one of the leaders of a prominent grassroots immigrant rights organization			2
he wanted me to connect his group with republicans who support immigration reform because it might pressure @entity2 to act			1
i can do one better			0
want to get comprehensive immigration reform ? elect a @entity75 president			1
@entity79 passes laws , but the president sets priorities			2
just like @entity2 did with health care reform , which is why we call the new law " @entity122 " and not " @entity123 " or " @entity124			1
" once you see through the political fog on the immigration debate , you realize that @entity75 presidents are a better bet for delivering reform			1
three reasons : first , ignore what politicians say and watch what they do			0
@entity136 campaign as soft on illegal immigrants , but they 're tough on them once in office			0
republicans campaign as tough on illegal immigrants , but they 're soft on them once in office			0
second , look at history			0
in 1986 , it was a @entity75 president , @entity143 , who signed an " amnesty " bill into law			1
twenty years later , it was another @entity75 , @entity149 , who boldly kicked off the modern debate over comprehensive immigration reform by proposing legal status for the undocumented			1
meanwhile , it was a @entity156 , @entity157 , who militarized the border with @entity159 in 1994 and signed a 1996 immigration law that made it easier to deport people and harder to return			2
now we have another @entity156 , @entity2 , who has deported more than 2 million people , roped local police into enforcing immigration law through the program known as @entity168 and shipped thousands of child refugees back to @entity170 without due process			1
third , understand human nature			0
@entity75 do n't love immigrants			2
but they love business , and business loves immigrants			0
meanwhile , @entity136 do n't hate immigrants			0
but they love unions , and unions hate immigrants			0
@entity2 : waiting will make immigration executive action ' more sustainable ' still , electing the right leaders is only half the job			1
the rest of it is holding them accountable			0
latinos should be furious at @entity2 's betrayal			2
but they should save some anger for themselves for believing the lies			0
as for @entity2 , he continues to insult @entity188 with more blame - shifting and double talk			1
now he insists that his decision to delay any executive action on immigration was n't based on politics -- except when it was			2
on sunday , during an appearance on @entity201 ' " @entity200 , " @entity2 told moderator @entity202 that contrary to earlier reports , he was not trying to help @entity136 in @entity79 keep their seats in november			2
instead , he realized that the recent surge of unaccompanied minors across the @entity62 - @entity208 border changed the political equation			2
" the truth of the matter , " @entity2 said , " is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem			2
" to summarize , the president who did n't have enough courage is blaming his ineptitude on child refugees who had an abundance of it			0
breaking his promise made the president look dishonest			0
admitting that it was about politics made him look weak			0
but blaming it all on the kids made him look pathetic .			0

@entity227 : the delay *announced* by president @entity2 is another broken pledge
he says promises that immigration reform would be a priority were not serious
history shows that @entity75 presidents , *friendly* to business , more likely to favor immigration , he says
@entity227 : @entity2 was *wrong* to blame his inaction on the surge of border kids
