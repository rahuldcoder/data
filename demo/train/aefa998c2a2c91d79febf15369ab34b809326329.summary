editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist and @entity5 political contributor , was a political consultant for @entity7 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to @entity7 in the @entity9			1
he was a co-host of " @entity10 " on @entity5 with @entity11 from 2002 to 2005			1
@entity2 says he admired @entity11 for his skepticism about authority , work ethic and faith in his beliefs			1
( @entity5 ) -- in our innumerable debates , i delighted in calling @entity11 " the finest mind of the 12th century			1
" one time , though , he scowled and growled , " i prefer the 15th century			0
" @entity11 left this world on tuesday , but he also left his mark			1
needless to say i disagreed with @entity11 about virtually every political issue , and sometimes our on - air debates continued as profanity - laced shouting matches after the show ended			1
despite our profound differences , though , we were friends			0
here 's why : @entity11 was an iconoclast			1
he loved poking conventional wisdom in the eye			0
if all the media elite were perched on the same wire , @entity11 would land on the opposite wire and gleefully squawk at them			1
@entity11 was an ideologue more than a partisan			1
one of the many sources of tension between us was the fact that i am a partisan @entity46 who believes that , from time to time , my personal ideological agenda must take a backseat to advancing a broader progressive agenda carried by my party			0
he was a conservative first , last and always , and when he felt the @entity52 had strayed from his hard - core anti-tax , anti-government ideology he would hammer the @entity52 with the same withering ridicule he usually dispensed to @entity3			1
@entity11 was deeply skeptical of authority			1
he was a lowly lieutenant in the @entity56 , and he instinctively distrusted big shots -- a rarity in a town that is often dazzled by rank			0
for a guy who said he preferred business to government , he was not afraid to show his contempt for network executives with whom he disagreed			0
@entity11 had a remarkable work ethic			1
in the predawn hours after the 2004 presidential debate in @entity68 , @entity11 slipped in the shower , breaking his hip			1
the injury was terribly painful , and @entity11 was rushed to the hospital			1
within 24 hours he was propped up in bed , working the phones and banging out a column on his laptop			0
@entity11 was an old - school reporter			1
most pundits ( your humble author included ) devour the reporting of others and regurgitate our opinions			0
while strongly opinionated , @entity11 also reported			1
his sources , especially in the @entity52 , were wide and deep			1
when i was a @entity9 official , one of my most dreaded responsibilities was dealing with @entity11			1
he did n't support much of anything we were trying to do , but he never lied to me , never broke his word , and tried his hardest to get things right			0
this will astonish some , because @entity11 could also be rude			2
but he taught me at least one lesson in civility			0
on " @entity10 , " i carried a debate over into the commercial break			0
i badgered and hectored and attacked the guest who was on the right			0
i was angry and i let him have it			0
" wait just a # * & $ @ # ^ minute , " @entity11 screamed at me			2
" you 're out of line			0
he 's come here on our show to make his case and you 're abusing him			0
we call them ' guests ' for a reason , @entity114			0
one tiny island of common ground @entity11 and i could share was a love of sports			2
when @entity121 and i joined " crossfire " in 2002 , @entity5 had a much - hyped debut planned for april 1			0
@entity124 was playing for the @entity126 basketball championship and he was going to be there			0
producers pleaded , but @entity11 was unmoved			2
he did the show via satellite from @entity131 , @entity132 , and when coach @entity133 cut down the net for the @entity124 , @entity11 was courtside			2
my brand of @entity136 and @entity11 's were as different as our brands of politics , but as a cradle @entity136 i admire anyone who , at age 67 , is still seeking the divine , still questioning , still open to a new faith			2
we spoke about faith often , and i 'm sure his catholic faith gave him great comfort as he battled the disease that claimed his life			0
requiem in pace , friend			2
or , as @entity11 might prefer : @entity154 , sweet @entity11			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity11 was a friend even though we differed on many issues
he says @entity11 was true to his conservative beliefs even when @entity52 strayed
he says @entity11 worked very hard at being a reporter as well as an advocate
