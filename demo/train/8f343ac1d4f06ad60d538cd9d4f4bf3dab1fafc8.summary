i operate the only abortion clinic in @entity3			1
for many of our patients , we are their last hope			0
a woman showed up on our doorstep recently in wrinkled clothes that she had been wearing for days			2
she told us she had traveled across three states , spending $ 100 on gas alone , before finally reaching her destination			2
after she was unable to get the care she needed at the clinic closest to her , she left her small town in the @entity18 panhandle and went to @entity19 , where she was told that her pregnancy was too far along to receive an abortion there			1
so she came to us			0
opinion : it 's a child , not a choice unfortunately for our patient , and millions of women like her , anti-choice extremists in states across the country have instituted politically motivated and medically unnecessary red tape to limit their access to basic -- and potentially lifesaving -- health care			1
the reality that these extremists fail to acknowledge is that abortion is one of the safest -- and most common -- medical procedures			1
in fact , colonoscopies are far more dangerous than abortions			0
when i hear about new proposals to further restrict access to safe and legal abortions , i see in my mind the faces of patients like ours			0
these women are forced to leave their children and jobs behind for days while they seek out a safe and legal medical procedure			1
in @entity55 , the law mandates that women receive biased information that is designed to persuade them not to have an abortion			1
among other things , patients are required to read a statement telling them they are about to " terminate the life of a whole , separate , unique , living human being			0
" then they are required to wait 24 hours before their abortion			2
for our patient , her three - day journey turned into four			0
in 2014 , many states made the process even more challenging for women seeking abortions			1
@entity74 joined a growing list of states that ban abortions after 20 weeks , well before fetal viability			2
both @entity79 and @entity80 expanded their state 's waiting periods			0
and in @entity18 , medically unnecessary legislation forced the closure of abortion clinics across the state			2
judicial hearings that began earlier this month will decide whether a component of the @entity18 law that requires all abortion clinics in the state -- even those that perform nonsurgical abortions and have excellent safety records -- to meet the costly standards of ambulatory surgery centers is constitutional			2
cases like this one are poised to have far - reaching impact on the ability of women to access safe and legal abortion care			1
unfortunately , it 's already clear that 2015 is going to be another year of long legislative battles for pro-choice advocates			0
before the year even began , a lawmaker in @entity80 proposed legislation that would require women to receive legal consent from the man who impregnated them before getting an abortion			1
when asked if the legislation would make allowances for victims of rape and incest , the bill 's author insisted that there would be an exception for victims of " legitimate rape			0
" echoing @entity122 's infamous words makes it clear that this bill intends to further strip away women 's rights in @entity80			1
while lawmakers across the country appear poised to continue this trend , what makes me hopeful is that champions of reproductive justice have taken notice and forced decision makers to protect the rights of women			1
last month , @entity138 's governor took steps to roll back politically motivated , unpopular abortion regulations that his predecessor initiated			0
in @entity74 , a judge blocked medically unnecessary legislation that would have forced the state 's last remaining abortion clinic to close			1
and in @entity147 and @entity148 , voters soundly rejected personhood measures that would have given fetuses more rights than the women carrying them			1
all these victories have one thing in common : someone stood up and said " enough			0
" enough playing politics with women 's bodies			0
enough pretending that politicians in state capitals are doctors			0
enough telling women when and how to have children			0
enough letting where a woman lives dictate her access to abortion services			0
the fight is not over for women who simply want the right to make their own medical decisions			1
this year , and as we mark the 42nd anniversary of the passage of @entity176 , i implore you to be one of the voices that says " enough			2

@entity181 , abortion *provider* in @entity55 , says some must travels days to find abortion clinic
she says some states have stepped up restrictions , not based on medical need , but *ideology*
@entity181 : @entity176 decision 42 years *ago* ; women today must take action to keep health care rights
