@entity2 , @entity3 even with a conviction , the " @entity1 " murder trial never answered the one question that still haunts the families of @entity1 and @entity8			1
why were the two men killed while trying to help @entity10 ? there have been a series of confusing and incoherent explanations for @entity10 's motives the afternoon of february 2 , 2013			1
we know @entity1 sensed tension as he and @entity8 drove the former @entity17 to a gun range for an afternoon of bonding and helping @entity10 cope with what his family members believed was post-traumatic stress disorder			1
@entity1 secretly texted @entity8 , sitting next to him in a pickup , to say @entity10 was " straight up nuts			1
" @entity1 's wife , @entity26 , " could tell something was up " that afternoon when she spoke to her husband			1
@entity1 sounded " irritated , " she has testified , then he never responded to a text asking if he was ok			1
yet @entity10 did n't reveal a clear reason in the fatal shootings			1
@entity1 was shot four times in the back and once in the face			1
@entity8 was shot five times in the back			0
instead , the jury heard a series of bizarre explanations for why @entity10 allegedly turned the guns on @entity1 and @entity8			1
@entity10 's attorneys said the @entity17 suffers from psychosis , paranoia and schizophrenia			1
prosecutors argued that @entity10 is a " troubled man " who struggles with a " personality disorder , " not insanity			1
' legend ' looms over murder trial the arguments were in direct contrast to one another			0
while dr. @entity54 , a forensic psychologist who testified as the prosecution 's medical expert , said @entity10 's heavy marijuana use caused a " substance - induced psychotic disorder , " dr. @entity53 said his opinion was that @entity10 's " psychosis was not substance - induced			1
" " it is my opinion that he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that caused him not to know his conduct was wrong , " @entity53 testified			0
one piece of evidence -- video from the police car after @entity10 's arrest -- shows the accused shooter complaining of mental problems and confusion			1
" i 've been so paranoid - schizophrenic all day , i do n't know what to even think of the world right now , " he told the officer			0
" i do n't know if i 'm insane			0
i do n't know what 's even sane in the world right now			2
" @entity82 worked as an officer in the @entity84 where @entity10 has been held since his arrest in the killings			2
@entity82 testified he heard @entity10 talk about the shootings four months after the tragedy			1
" i heard mr. @entity10 say , ' i shot them because they would n't talk to me			2
i was just riding in the back seat of the truck and nobody would talk to me			0
they were just taking me to the range so i shot them			0
i feel bad about it , but they would n't talk to me			0
i 'm sure they 've forgiven me , ' " @entity82 said			0
family : @entity10 acted bizarrely for years in may 2013 , @entity10 did a phone interview from jail with @entity104 magazine writer @entity103			2
portions of the recorded conversation were played for the jury			0
@entity10 described being annoyed with @entity1 and @entity8 as they made the 90 - minute drive from his home to the countryside gun range			1
@entity10 did n't trust the @entity112 and his friend after their first meeting , he told @entity103			2
" that 's how i felt that day , " @entity10 said on the recording			1
" it was the smell in the air that morning			0
it smelled like s * * t. " @entity10 continued , " it smelled like sweet cologne			2
i guess it was love and hate , you know			0
i was smelling love and hate			0
they were giving me some love and hate			0
" later in the phone call , @entity10 complained that @entity1 and @entity8 stopped to feed him at a fast - food restaurant on the way to the range			1
it was " strange " because he was n't hungry , and he felt the two men were trying to " force feed " him , @entity10 said to @entity103			2
@entity10 's attorneys have suggested it was the arsenal of firearms lying next to @entity10 that triggered his psychosis and paranoia on the car ride			1
" at the time of this tragedy , @entity145 was insane , " defense attorney @entity144 said			0
" not only was he suffering from a severe mental disease or defect , not only did he not know his conduct was wrong , he thought he had to take their lives because he was in danger			0
" @entity10 said that when the men started shooting pistols at the gun range , he saw it as a showdown			2
" so we 're shooting pistols here , huh ? " @entity10 recalls telling @entity1 and @entity8 during his conversation with @entity103			1
" again , that 's pretty much saying , ' duel mother * * * * er. ' " when @entity103 asked what triggered him picking up a firearm and shooting @entity1 and @entity8 , @entity10 replied that he was angry that @entity8 would not participate in the shooting			1
" i asked him a couple of times , ' hey , are you gon na shoot ? ' " @entity10 said			2
" this is n't a spectator sport			0
it 's a shooting sport			0
and that 's what got all , you know , wired up			0
" after that exchange , @entity10 said , " i took care of business and then i got in the truck and left			2
" after deliberating less than three hours , a @entity3 jury found @entity10 guilty of capital murder in the case			2
judge @entity185 immediately sentenced him to life in prison without parole			0
