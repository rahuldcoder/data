-- @entity1 is the king of football gamesmanship , but his constant declarations that @entity6 's @entity5 lead is " fake " appear to be becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy			1
saturday 's controversial defeat at @entity9 allowed @entity10 to close to within six points , with three games in hand on the @entity15 club and a vastly superior goal difference			1
@entity10 bounced back from the midweek @entity18 exit in @entity19 by winning 2 - 0 at @entity20 , despite having influential captain @entity21 sent off in just the 10th minute			1
@entity1 was also sent to the stands at @entity23 , following second - half red cards to @entity6 midfielders @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity26 's second booking seemed harsh , but -- after @entity30 put @entity9 ahead with a delightful backheel flick -- his fellow @entity29 deserved to go after a vicious tackle on @entity32			1
referee @entity33 has now issued six red cards to @entity6 players in the last eight of the club 's matches in which he has officiated -- and @entity1 was fighting to keep his feelings hidden afterwards in fear of being punished by the authorities			1
" i prefer not to speak about the decisions			0
if i speak i am in big trouble , " he said after his team 's 14 - match unbeaten run was ended by a @entity9 side that moved up to 10th place			2
" the referees do what they do			0
they go home and they do n't talk to the press , and they refuse even to exchange a couple of words , when one person like me -- that is in football for so long -- asks politely , ' can you speak with me for five seconds ? ' " i ask five seconds to make one simple question and i had no chance because i was sent to the stands			0
" it 's difficult to close the mouth , it 's very difficult but i have to do it because i do n't want to bring the game into disrepute			0
" @entity10 moved up to second place , but @entity70 and @entity71 could trim @entity6 's lead to four points on sunday with victories in crunch clashes against rivals @entity76 and @entity78 respectively			1
it was a difficult start to a big week for @entity6 , whose @entity18 hopes will be tested by tuesday 's visit of @entity83 ahead of next weekend 's home clash with @entity71			2
city host the @entity5 's bottom team @entity87 next saturday ahead of the @entity89 derby at @entity90 and a trip to @entity71			0
" i think it was a very good response from the team			0
it was a very difficult week , " @entity10 boss @entity94 said of his team 's win after @entity21 was dismissed for bringing down @entity97			0
" i thought before it was clear foul by @entity97 before @entity21 did his foul -- but the referee did n't see it , he saw the foul of @entity21 and he sent him off			0
" @entity105 closed to within two points of fifth - placed @entity78 with a 2 - 1 win at home to second - bottom @entity109 , and @entity111 's team have a game in hand on the @entity114			2
@entity115 moved up to eighth with a 4 - 2 win over @entity117 , while @entity118 dropped down after losing 1 - 0 at @entity87			1
@entity119 joined @entity9 on 34 points with a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity123 , as former @entity125 striker @entity124 scored twice			2
@entity126 stayed in the bottom three after drawing 0 - 0 with fellow strugglers @entity127 , but @entity128 moved three points away from the relegation zone by winning 2 - 1 at @entity131			2
the previous day @entity128 sacked @entity132 after the former @entity133 international said he had terminated his own contract in reaction to the club 's response to his fine and ban for performing a controversial " quenelle " gesture during a match in december .			0

@entity1 sent off along with two @entity6 players in 1 - 0 defeat at @entity9
@entity30 scores the only goal in 82nd minute after @entity26 's second booking
@entity27 also departs after a studs - up *challenge* on @entity9 's @entity32
@entity10 cut *gap* to six points despite having captain sent off at @entity20
