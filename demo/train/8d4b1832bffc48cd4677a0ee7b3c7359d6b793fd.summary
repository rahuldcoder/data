building and programing a robot from scratch may sound like an impossible task to most primary school students , but one man is changing that mind - set for a generation of @entity9			1
by showing students as young as six how robots can solve real - world problems , @entity11 founder @entity10 wants young people to develop a creative skill set they can apply to solve issues specific to their lives			1
" we have a team in northern @entity9 building an automated farming program , " explains 32 year - old @entity10			1
" the project includes an irrigation system for crops and also a temperature monitoring solution to make sure ... cow feed does n't overheat and go bad			0
the students are also working on an automatic seed dispenser to feed pigs			2
" @entity9 learning in a country where over 90 % of primary school - aged children are enrolled in classes , according to @entity36 data , @entity11 first focuses on extracurricular time slots in schools			1
as well as presentations and video - based learning , @entity11 also offers hands - on robotics training and helps keen students form weekly @entity44			1
the initiative has taken off in 15 schools spread across the capital , @entity48 , and @entity49 in the north where experienced mentors visit once or twice a month to offer ideas and encouragement			1
but tinkering with robotic parts and coming up with new ideas carries on after school too			2
during holiday camps ( which can last two weeks ) students are taught robotic concepts and then given time to implement that learning by building a robot by the end of the camp			0
@entity67 to the @entity11 philosophy is that building robots does not require a fortune			1
students are encouraged to use recycled materials or components like laser pointers and microphones that were never originally designed to be a robotic building - block			2
" one group of 13 and 14 - year - olds is creating a small remote controlled vehicle with a temperature reader on the front that could be used in fire - risk areas , " @entity10 explains			0
" their idea uses a wireless transmitter which sends data back in real - time , but they managed to keep costs quite low at around $ 130 , by using locally sourced materials like wheels from toy cars			2
" while the physical components may not command high prices , the skills students gain in the process could prove lucrative			2
according to @entity100 , the global market for robotics amounted to $ 25.8 billion in june 2014 and is expected to grow to more than $ 70 billion by 2020			2
@entity102 robots while the @entity11 ' program is showing initial signs of having an impact in @entity9 , @entity10 says that 's just the start			1
" @entity11 is based in @entity9 , but our five year mandate is to build a presence in five @entity112 countries by the end of 2020 , " explains @entity10			1
" the most promising country at the moment is @entity116 because the government is very forward thinking and very keen to develop as the @entity119 powerhouse in the region			0
" @entity11 , which held a workshop in @entity116 last october , might be the first robotics teaching program in @entity9 , but it is not the only one of its kind in @entity112			1
the @entity126 ( @entity127 ) was established in @entity128 in april 2012 to improve education around robotics			0
one way the group has worked on this goal is by organizing the week - long @entity134			0
it was during this set of workshops that a participant developed the @entity140 - a basic " mini-explorer " robot which can navigate obstacles and learn about its surroundings			0
the robot , which uses @entity145 lollipops in the design , can be built from scratch for a total cost of just $ 8.96			0
" the enthusiasm of the kids is incredible , " says @entity149 , assistant computer science professor at @entity151 and co-founder of the @entity126			0
" recognizing that a robot can be made from familiar items like a computer mouse , or game controller really demystifies robotics and electronics for them			0
" robots are also playing a more prominent role in @entity164 , the capital of the @entity165			0
eight feet tall robotic traffic wardens designed and built by a team of local engineers , have been recording and controlling traffic 24 hours a day for just less than a year			0
as the @entity9 students learn new ways to build robots , @entity10 says there 's no limit to what could emerge from the workshops and retreats			1
" when i see the students coming up with innovative ideas i really see minds are being changed			0
students are being exposed to the creative process and i look forward to seeing them come up with bigger projects in five or 10 years time			2

@entity190 is teaching @entity9 school children to build robots
@entity194 founded @entity11 in 2011 to help students develop creative problem - solving skills
@entity11 has a presence in 15 schools across @entity9 and plans to expand to other @entity112 countries
@entity204 *companies* spent over $ *335* million on robots in first *quarter* of 2014
