@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 workers rallied in central @entity1 on thursday after unions called a general strike to protest the government 's sudden decision to halt activities at the country 's state broadcaster			1
thousands gathered outside the headquarters of the broadcaster , @entity14 , whose tv channels and radio services were pulled off the air overnight tuesday to wednesday			1
government officials are defending the decision as a necessary budget - cutting move as the country struggles with a debt mountain , soaring unemployment and a lengthy recession			1
there was more bad news thursday , as new figures showed the unemployment rate rising higher			1
overall unemployment reached 27.4 % in the first quarter of 2013 , according to the @entity32 , up from 26 % in the last quarter of 2012 , and 22.6 % a year ago			1
the strike action has affected all public transportation in the capital and threatened some disruption to flights			0
the sudden shutdown of @entity14 has prompted fear among many @entity0 that other public sector employers could be next			1
inside the @entity14 building , where some journalists are still broadcasting via the @entity44 , the mood is grim			1
" we are in a state of shock			1
the news is overwhelming , " @entity48 , on the foreign desk , told @entity2			1
" we feel insulted by our government , by our prime minister			2
" we feel angry and we feel that we are being terrorized by our government			2
... for me personally i feel lost , but in a case that is not lost			0
i 've been working here for 21 years now and it feels as if my life has reached a dead end			0
it means a new beginning but i do n't know how this will be possible			0
" also i feel embarrassed			0
right now thousands of people do n't know what comes next			2
" @entity48 is also concerned about the impact on the @entity0 diaspora and those living in border areas , " who have now lost their connection with the motherland " and must rely on privately owned media for news			0
' no prospects ' in the newsroom , journalists who would normally have been working on broadcasts are turning their hands to sweeping , cleaning up and , they say , making sure that public property is not destroyed			0
@entity79 , who has worked at @entity14 for 19 years , said she never expected to see the events of the past two days -- and she fears for the future			1
" being here for 19 years is part of my existence and suddenly this comes to a grinding halt overnight , " she said			0
" we already had a 38 % salary cut since 2010 , so i have used all of my savings and now i find myself in a situation with no money and no job and no prospects of employment , when unemployment figures in @entity0 stand at 27 %			1
" the @entity97 and the @entity98 oppose the decision and called for industrial action through the day thursday			0
their support helped swell the number of demonstrators outside the @entity14 headquarters , estimated at about 10,000 by @entity1 police			1
among the protesters was @entity107 , a 21 - year - old law student from @entity108 who is studying in @entity1			0
" what the government has done is no better than what @entity111 is doing in @entity113			0
suppressing people 's voices , " he said , referring to the crackdown on protests in @entity116 and elsewhere			0
prime minister @entity119 described ert wednesday as a " symbol of waste and lack of transparency " that needed to be changed			0
but the decision to abruptly shut down the broadcaster , which has been in operation since 1938 , has sparked division within the coalition government			1
@entity119 , leader of the center - right @entity129 , is due to meet with the other two party leaders in the coalition on monday , when the question will be discussed			0
no room for ' sacred cows ' government spokesman @entity136 cited chronic corruption and mismanagement of funds as reasons the broadcaster was closed down , at least temporarily			1
" at a time when the @entity0 people are enduring sacrifices , there is no room for delay , hesitation or tolerance for sacred cows , " @entity136 said in announcement shown on the broadcaster			1
@entity14 has said the decision means 2,656 employees will lose their jobs			2
to meet its commitments to its creditors -- the @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 -- the @entity0 government has to dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014			2
@entity136 said a new television and radio broadcaster would open with a much smaller staff , with existing employees able to apply for new positions			1
a " modern television and radio broadcaster will be established that will operate as soon as possible , " he said			2
an exact time frame for the new organization has not been announced , but a government spokesman said the new broadcaster should be operational before the end of the summer			2
the @entity179 said the new state broadcaster would be called the @entity181			2
journalists dismayed the @entity158 said wednesday it had not sought the closure of @entity14 , " but nor does the @entity158 question the @entity0 @entity186 's mandate to manage the public sector			2
" it added that the commission " supports the role of public broadcasting as an integral part of @entity192 democracy			0
" @entity194 expressed dismay over what it said was a " bizarre " decision by the government to shut down @entity14 's activities while carrying out the overhaul of its services			1
" @entity0 has fallen almost 50 places in the past three years in the @entity194 press freedom index , a record fall in such a short period for a @entity208 member state , " a statement said			0
" the reasons include violence against reporters covering anti-austerity demonstrations , which goes completely unpunished , and threats against journalists and other news providers by the @entity217 's neo-nazis			0
" against this backdrop , the closure of @entity14 's tv stations has dealt a devastating blow to pluralism and freedom of information in @entity0			1
" @entity0 lawmakers agreed in april to cut thousands of government workers to secure another â ‚ ¬ 8.8 billion ( $ 11.5 billion ) in international bailout funds			2
