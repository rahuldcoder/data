-- @entity2 's economy was tarnished by a decade - long civil war , but the resource - rich @entity5 nation is now ready to bounce back , according to the country 's president			1
@entity9 said that a series of key financial reforms can help the @entity5 country transform in the coming decades			1
" i 've challenged @entity2 -- and i 'm sure they 've accepted the challenge -- that in the next 50 years , we are not only going to transform ourselves from a low - income country , but we will get ourselves to the level of middle - income country , " he says			1
" by the next 50 years , @entity2 will be a donor nation rather than a recipient nation , " @entity9 adds			1
the ambitious declaration comes as @entity2 , whose tumultuous civil war ended in 2002 , is stepping up efforts to improve its weak infrastructure -- the government is working with @entity27 company @entity26 to expand the @entity29 project in order to increase generation capacity in one of @entity34 's least electrified countries			2
@entity9 , who 's been @entity2 's president since 2007 , spoke to @entity35 about the @entity37 project and other development strategies aimed at bringing in more investors			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : as president , how do you rally a society past the trauma of war and help it keep the eye focused on the future ? @entity9 : we have had our difficult past and we do n't want to stick on the past			1
we want to focus on the future and that is why we are galvanizing the people to ensure that we learn from the mistakes of the past			0
we have opportunities , we have a great potential out there and @entity2 will transform itself			2
president : @entity2 's ' blood diamonds ' in the past i have made a pronouncement during our 50th anniversary celebrations that as a nation we have to look at our 50 years as a period of not only celebrating but reflecting on the issues of the past -- also using the mistakes of the past as lessons to ensure that our future and the next 50 years will be a future of a difference			2
and i 've challenged @entity2 -- and i 'm sure they 've accepted the challenge -- that in the next 50 years , we are not only going to transform ourselves from a low - income country , but we will get ourselves to the level of middle - income country and by the next 50 years , @entity2 will be a donor nation rather than a recipient nation			1
@entity0 : it 's been 10 years since the war , look ahead the next 10 years , where do you see @entity2 ? @entity82 : @entity2 will have developed democratic values , to the point where it will no longer be considered as a fragile state			1
with all of the opportunities that avail themselves in the mineral sector , the agriculture sector , the tourism , we should be able to transform ourselves to a medium - level country			0
i believe with these gains we have made , we are not going to rest , we are going to continue to press on and @entity2 will be the place for investment opportunities			0
and with that , i 'm sure within the next 10 years , @entity2 will be completely different			0
we will have basic infrastructures established , the road network will be up and about ; communications , we 'll be landing a fiber optic by next month and it will enhance our communication ; educational sectors are now going through a reform process and we will continue to provide leadership and @entity2 will be completely different in the next 10 years			0
@entity0 : in many fragile post conflict states , the key challenge is infrastructure and making sure the infrastructure is able to manage the rebuilding of the whole country and the whole society			2
@entity82 : we quickly agreed on prioritizing our development agenda , and we call it in @entity2 , the @entity115			2
and ( in ) that agenda we have energy , agriculture , infrastructure , health and education as the key sectors that should be given a priority and attention ... we believe that because of our agriculture potential , if we enhance our agricultural productivity , we will not only be addressing the issues of food , self - sufficiency but we 'll be addressing the issues of employment creation and also poverty reduction			0
@entity0 : @entity2 , right now , is one of the least electrified countries in @entity34 but now you have this @entity29 project -- what are the immediate benefits for the economy and for the people of @entity2 ? @entity82 : we inherited a very difficult situation in the energy sector			1
it was a sector that had less than 10 megawatts of energy provision for the whole country			0
that is why we , as a government , worked on the completion of the @entity149 , it is a project that has been well under construction for over 30 years ... and people are realizing the benefits			0
some of them have increased their domestic and economic activities because of a constant energy generation and they know that at the end of the day , " if i pay my bills , i will continue to enjoy the supply and i enjoy the supply , i will be able to provide the services that will provide me an income , " so i think it is a win - win situation .			0
