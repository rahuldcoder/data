@entity0 @entity2 poised to take control of @entity4 are already threatening to kill what could turn out to be president @entity7 's most significant second - term achievement : a nuclear deal with @entity9			1
@entity11 and @entity9 negotiators are quickly approaching a november 24 deadline to reach an agreement that would freeze @entity9 's nuclear program in return for lifting international sanctions on the @entity17			1
hopes for a deal have been rising , though @entity7 cautioned this weekend a " big gap " remains between the two sides and there are powerful constituencies in each country angling against an agreement			1
in the @entity11 , republicans -- long skeptical of the talks -- are increasingly furious that @entity7 might sideline @entity4 to finalize an accord			2
they 're especially angry that the administration might make such a move after last week 's midterm elections gave the @entity2 -- dominated by foreign policy hard - liners -- firm control of the @entity34 and @entity35			1
" like @entity38 in the 1990s , @entity9 will use a weak deal as cover to get nuclear weapons , " said @entity36 @entity2 sen. @entity2 , a prominent skeptic of the negotiations			1
given the opposition , the @entity7 administration is believed to favor a framework agreement that , at least initially , would not require @entity4 to lift sanctions			1
instead , the president would temporarily " suspend " them			0
the personal stakes for @entity7 are immense as he seeks to restore his footing following last week 's election drubbing			2
a deal would elevate his legacy , which lacks a defining foreign policy triumph , and validate his vow to talk to leaders of @entity11 enemies first made in a @entity1 campaign debate seven years ago			0
it would also mark a stunning diplomatic breakthrough after 35 years of estrangement between @entity0 and @entity61 and represent a major advance on one of the world 's thorniest non-proliferation problems			2
some of the president 's critics doubtless sense a chance to deny @entity7 a diplomatic win			2
what to expect from the lame duck @entity4 but others , including some @entity73 , worry that @entity7 is being hoodwinked by @entity9			1
they fear the mullahs will pocket sanctions relief and then cheat their way to a nuclear bomb			0
republicans could respond to what they see as a " bad " deal by seeking to impose new sanctions or drawing up punitive oversight benchmarks for @entity9 compliance			1
that could so sour already tenuous confidence between @entity0 and @entity61 that the deal could crumble			2
@entity88 @entity2 sen. @entity87 said this weekend that he would back a " good " @entity9 deal but would " kill " any agreement that he found problematic			1
on thursday , @entity87 will try to bring up a bill in the @entity35 that would require @entity7 to submit any agreement to @entity4 within three days for review			1
if he refuses , or if lawmakers vote to show their disapproval of the deal , funding for its implementation would be cutoff			0
and @entity2 has already pledged to mobilize the new @entity35 behind legislation he wrote with @entity73 sen. @entity101 which would target @entity9 's oil industry with sanctions and provide a " diplomatic insurance policy " he says would result in a " strong deal " to reverse @entity61 's nuclear program			1
some @entity7 opponents on @entity108 reject the idea they are opposed to any deal and say an agreement is possible that would address their concerns			1
but they complain the @entity34 has not worked with lawmakers to arrive at the best combination of carrots and sticks in the talks			0
they contend that a bad deal is now more likely because the administration has been too eager to make concessions to @entity9			2
the @entity34 declined to discuss its tactics			0
but the administration has long warned that new sanctions would upend its diplomacy and it denies accusations that @entity7 plans to go around @entity4			2
@entity126 steps up nuclear plans in @entity9 as talks near deadline @entity7 would be sure veto any legislation that could threaten the agreement			1
but @entity2 could draw on skeptical @entity73 to get closer to a veto proof majority of 67 @entity35 votes			0
an official with a prominent @entity136 policy group in @entity0 added : " it is not a question of doing the math. the precise change is in the leader 's office			0
that now enables sanctions legislation to move forward			0
" but other sources doubt that if it really came to it , there would be enough @entity73 to challenge the president 's veto and risk being accused of trashing a deal the rest of the world has embraced			0
but they admit the numbers are tightening			0
@entity155 , a research associate at @entity156 and an expert on @entity9 nuclear diplomacy , predicted a fierce political battle			0
" there will definitely be a fight			0
it will be a hard fight , but i think it will be a fight that the president can win because the consequences of failure are high , " he said			0
the @entity34 has already won one skirmish over @entity9			1
last year , critics sought to derail an interim nuclear deal , but failed largely because @entity73 senate majority leader @entity171 blocked sanctions bills			0
@entity7 will not have that safety net in the new @entity2 @entity35 that convenes in january , and backers of an agreement fear even the threat of tougher action			1
@entity178 , director of government affairs for @entity180 , a left - leaning @entity136 group said new sanctions would " guarantee " a fracturing of the international coalition against @entity9			1
even if opponents fail to overcome a veto , @entity4 could still stir up the kind of trouble that could embolden hardline opponents of president @entity191 who argue @entity0 can never be trusted to stick to its commitments			0
and a deal could not survive as " temporary " forever -- eventually @entity4 would have to act			0
" it is clear there is a significant problem , " said @entity194 , founder of the @entity195 , which advocates dialogue between @entity0 and @entity61			0
" at the end of the day , the president needs to lift sanctions through @entity4 in order to make a deal possible			0
" the politics on @entity9 are getting trickier for @entity7 by the day			1
@entity2 are outraged at reports last week that he wrote to @entity9 's supreme leader @entity207 , days before the @entity208 issued a barrage of tweets slamming the " barbaric , wolflike and infanticidal regime " in @entity212			1
meanwhile , a report by the @entity215 's nuclear watchdog body last week suggested @entity61 may have violated an interim nuclear deal by feeding natural uranium gas into one of its centrifuges			2
@entity9 was also accused of blocking existing inspections to its nuclear plants			0
the @entity34 has already shown it is ready to play political hardball over @entity9 , warning last year that anyone who opposes the deal is effectively backing a march to war with @entity9			1
@entity7 is also at odds over @entity9 with @entity212 prime minister @entity230 , who views the prospect of an @entity9 bomb as an existential threat to the jewish state			1
@entity230 warned in a video address to @entity237 leaders on tuesday that it was obvious @entity9 wanted to remove sanctions and it should be " equally obvious " that it is not prepared to dismantle its nuclear program in return			2
the @entity34 argues @entity212 's demand for a complete dismantling of @entity9 's nuclear infrastructure is impractical			2
instead , it wants the deal between the permanent five members of the @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity9 to lengthen the period of time it would take @entity61 to dash towards a bomb			1
" we will not let @entity9 get a nuclear weapon			0
we mean it , " vice president @entity254 said in @entity0 monday as negotiators from @entity9 , the @entity11 and @entity255 toiled in @entity257 to bridge gaps on a deal ahead of a final round of talks in @entity262 next week			2
in the event they 're successful , the pressure on key lawmakers from the @entity34 and @entity136 lobby groups will be intense			0
incoming @entity2 @entity269 chairman @entity268 will be a vital player , as he has voiced skepticism of the president 's @entity9 diplomacy in the past , while being more pragmatic than other @entity7 critics on sanctions			1
another key player is sen. @entity277 , who is staunchly pro-israel but could give fellow @entity73 cover to stick with their president by backing a deal			0
and @entity281 will increasingly be looked to by @entity73 for guidance in the event of a deal			0
the former secretary of state and potential 2016 contender has backed @entity7 's diplomacy but expressed skepticism @entity9 would sign on to a verifiable deal to halt its nuclear @entity290			1

@entity2 senator to bring up bill that would require @entity7 to submit @entity9 deal for approval
new sanctions could embolden hard - liners in @entity61
@entity34 likely to warn of possible march to war if agreement fails
