-- @entity2 is more than a year away from developing a nuclear weapon , but that does not mean the @entity5 will wait for it to become a reality , president @entity1 said in an interview that aired thursday on an @entity9 television station			1
" i have been crystal clear about my position on @entity2 possessing a nuclear weapon			1
that is a red line for us			0
it is not only something that would be dangerous for @entity9			2
it would be dangerous for the world , " @entity1 told @entity0 affiliate @entity9 channel 2 tv before a scheduled visit next week to the country			2
" ... i 've also said there is a window -- not an infinite period time , but a window of time -- where we can resolve this diplomatically			0
" @entity9 prime minister @entity30 has repeatedly called on @entity1 to establish a clear line that @entity2 can not cross with its nuclear program , if it wants to avoid war			1
@entity1 has resisted such a move , and @entity30 has shown growing impatience with what he has previously called a lack of clarity by the @entity1 administration on articulating red lines over @entity2 's nuclear ambitions			1
@entity5 intelligence officials have said they do not believe @entity2 has decided to develop a nuclear weapon , even as evidence continues to mount that the country is improving its ability to do so			1
no ' chest beating ' on @entity2 , but @entity1 issues challenge @entity2 denies that it aims to build a nuclear bomb , saying that its nuclear program is for energy and medical use			1
" right now , we think that it would take over a year or so for @entity2 to actually develop a nuclear weapon , " @entity1 told @entity53			1
the interview was conducted wednesday in @entity58 , the channel said			0
" but obviously , we do n't want to cut it too close			0
what we are going to do is to continue to engage internationally with @entity2			0
" @entity1 also said he believes that the international economic sanctions , some of the " strongest " ever imposed against @entity62 , are having an effect on the country			0
" they are not yet at the point , i think , where they 've made a fundamental decision to get right with the international community , " the president said			0
" but i do think they are recognizing that there is a severe cost for them to continue down the path they are on and that there 's another door open			0
" @entity1 said his message to @entity30 during his visit to @entity9 would be much the same as it has previously been			1
" if we can resolve it diplomatically , that 's a more lasting solution			0
if not , i continue to keep all options on the table , " he said			0
when pushed during the interview to define those options , the president responded : " when i say all options are on the table , all options are on the table			0
the @entity5 obviously has significant capabilities			0
" he said the goal is to ensure that @entity2 does not develop a nuclear weapon that could threaten @entity9 or trigger a possible arms race in the region			1
official : cyberattacks top @entity5 threats @entity5 - @entity9 relationship @entity1 's three - day visit to @entity9 next week is widely viewed as an opportunity for the president to relay the @entity5 ' commitment to @entity9 and its security			1
it is his first trip to @entity9 since being elected president			2
he has visited the country three times , the last as a @entity5 senator			0
the relationship between @entity30 and @entity1 has been reportedly tense in large part because of their differences over major issues such as @entity2 's nuclear development and the @entity9 - @entity123 peace process			1
@entity1 downplayed the tension between the two leaders but conceded that relations between his administration and @entity30 's government have not always been sunny			1
" there are conservative views both here in the @entity5 and in @entity9 that may not jibe with mine , particularly when there is an election season coming up , " he said			0
during last year 's presidential election , @entity30 and other @entity9 officials painted @entity1 's challenger , @entity137 , as a stronger proponent of @entity9 and its security			1
@entity9 's new government excludes ultra-religious @entity9 - @entity123 peace @entity1 said he plans to meet not only with @entity30 and @entity9 government but also with the @entity144 's president , @entity145 , and its prime minister , @entity146			1
@entity1 has repeatedly said he backs a two - state solution			1
" it 's not a matter of unilateral concessions			0
it 's a matter of both parties coming together and recognizing that their futures will be inextricably linked and that @entity9 will be safer , more secure , more prosperous , if the issue can be resolved , " he said			2
" and , obviously , @entity9 ca n't resolve it by itself			0
but it ca n't stop trying			0
" @entity5 commander says @entity2 sanctions not working @entity5 spy @entity1 also is likely to face questions during his visit about the possible release of convicted spy @entity163 , a @entity5 citizen sentenced to life in prison for giving @entity5 military secrets to @entity9			1
@entity163 was a civilian intelligence analyst for the @entity167 when he was arrested in 1985 on charges that he provided secrets to the @entity9			2
he pleaded guilty to one count of espionage			0
the @entity9 government , which has acknowledged that @entity163 was its spy , granted him citizenship and has been lobbying for his release			2
but while he is considered a patriot by the @entity9 government , @entity163 has been turned down for clemency by presidents @entity178 and @entity179			2
" i have no plans of releasing @entity163 immediately , " @entity1 said during the interview			1
the president also did not commit to reviewing the case other than to ensure that @entity163 , as a @entity5 citizen , is " accorded the same kind of review " given to all @entity5			2
@entity2 , world powers agree to expert talks on @entity62 's nuclear program			2
