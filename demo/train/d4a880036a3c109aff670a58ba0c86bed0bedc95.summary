-- this is no way to run a party			2
the details of the scandal sweeping the @entity5 are tawdry , sad and infuriating -- and a wake - up call to a national party that is urgently seeking to make inroads among black , @entity10 , and young voters			1
barely two weeks after @entity15 chairman @entity14 and @entity17 @entity16 chairman @entity16 held a press conference at a black church in @entity20 to launch the party 's ambitious , $ 10 million diversity campaign , @entity13 agents arrested @entity23 , a longtime black state legislator			1
according to federal prosecutors , @entity23 spent months organizing cash bribes to two top city @entity16 officials in exchange for a slot on the ballot in this fall 's @entity16 primary for mayor			1
unfortunately for @entity23 , a real estate tycoon he enlisted to make cash payments was , in fact , an undercover @entity13 agent , according to federal prosecutors			0
the criminal complaint against @entity23 and five others -- including a @entity16 city council member and the chairman and vice chairman of two @entity16 county organizations -- details mind - boggling details of recorded conversations and alleged handovers of envelopes stuffed with money			0
all the scheming , say prosecutors , was done in the hope that @entity23 might secure the @entity16 nomination and somehow win the race for mayor in a city where @entity57 outnumber @entity16 6 - to - 1			2
@entity23 will get his day in court , along with the five other men and women named -- but the damage to the party is incalculable			1
in a 100 - page plan of action , @entity14 and the @entity15 laid out a pilot project to build support among black urban voters , and specifically declared that " big - city mayoral races provide our best 2013 opportunities for these projects			2
" @entity5 can probably be crossed off that list , and the fallout will be felt in other cities as the case unfolds			0
and that 's a shame			0
@entity16 leaders are right to make their case to young , urban , black and @entity10 voters , and should be grooming candidates from all communities			0
@entity84 's two - party system ca n't function properly if the parties are racially divided			0
the flirtation with the @entity5 by @entity23 , a lifelong @entity87 -- if done honestly -- might have started a new conversation within black circles about the cost and wisdom of always supporting @entity57 candidates and policies			1
it has long been noticed that black communities contain their share of church - going social conservatives ; the @entity100 theory is that intelligent outreach to those voters could tilt close contests to @entity16			1
that 's not likely to happen now			0
@entity23 's troubles -- and the arrest of @entity16 leaders accused of taking money to advance @entity23 's cross-party ambitions -- will supply ammunition to conservative party leaders who are skeptical about the new diversity strategy			1
the scandal also weakens the argument , popular among national @entity16 , that big - city @entity57 political machines are corrupt and wasteful			0
in @entity117 , at least , the shoe is on the other foot , with @entity100 party leaders in the nation 's biggest city hauled from their homes in handcuffs and facing up to 40 years in prison or more			1
it now falls to @entity117 's @entity16 chairman , @entity16 , to straighten out this mess			2
@entity16 knows his way around a scandal : as the son - in - law of the late president @entity131 , he had a ringside seat as the @entity134 debacle unfolded			0
@entity16 must do whatever it takes to chase any crooked characters out of his party -- and try , against the odds , to continue @entity14 ' outreach strategy			0
doing so will be a challenge , because the next black or @entity10 @entity16 candidate will face the question : are you another @entity23 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			1

state *lawmaker* accused of bribing @entity100 officials to *put* him on ballot for @entity117 mayor
@entity146 : for a party trying to woo blacks and @entity156 , the damage is incalculable
louis : it could have started *discussions* about blacks always supporting *democrats*
as it is , he says , scandal will *hamstring* next black or @entity100 candidate
