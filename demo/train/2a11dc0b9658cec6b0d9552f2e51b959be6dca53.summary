-- how do you follow a phenomenon like @entity3 ? it is 18 months in april since one of the greatest horses ever to grace the planet retired in a blaze of glory , with his 14th race win from 14 starts to take his career earnings just shy of £ 3 million ( $ 5 million )			1
it led to a rating of 147 from @entity14 , making him the highest - rated horse since the records began			2
his trainer @entity18 , who passed away last year following a battle with cancer , said of the horse with a top speed of 42 mph : " he 's the best i 've ever seen			1
i 'd be very surprised if there 's ever been a better horse			1
" @entity3 was once described as a " lightning strike of genetics , which may not be repeated for 100 years			1
" jockey @entity28 was on board for the duration of his career and likens him to the " @entity32 of horse racing			1
" " really , you can compare him to any of the greats in any sport , in fact in any walk of life and that 's him			2
he was just head and shoulders above everyone else			0
" today , @entity3 stands in a luxury stable at @entity44 in southeast @entity46 county of @entity47 , fed and watered and walked out to breed with the world 's fastest and most famous horses			1
the world 's wealthiest horse owners pay £ 125,000 ( $ 210,000 ) for every impregnation , as they try to unearth the next @entity3			1
in his first season alone , he covered 133 mares			0
@entity28 admits that part of him will be excited to get the opportunity to ride these offspring in future , but he is also under no illusions about the reality of life after @entity3			1
following that last race , he asked : " everything 's going to be an anticlimax after @entity3 is n't it ? " in reality , he knew the answer			1
" no - one can compare to @entity3 , no one will ever compare to him as every moment spent on his back was a special moment , " the @entity69 told @entity0			1
" there 's different eras in different sports and inevitably people will always make comparisons			2
but i 'm a realist , i know i wo n't ever ride a horse like that again			1
it 'll be fun to ride his impact			2
i think we 'll still see @entity3 's impact on horse racing in that regard			1
i think he 'd like the idea he 's still making a mark			2
" @entity3 's temperament is not quite like that of some of the great racehorses , who are often jittery , tetchy animals , highly sprung and highly strung			1
in contrast , @entity3 has always been a fairly placid soul			2
but even a year and a half on from that moment he last delighted packed stands as he ripped up the turf at @entity101 to win the @entity102 , @entity28 can still easily recall his majesty			1
" he was just a superstar , pure and simple , " says @entity28			2
" he had an enormous amount of ability and he just dominated simply because he was far superior to everyone else			0
he had a lovely temperament and was just very professional in every way imaginable			0
" he was n't that easy to ride to start with -- he had a bit of a hold but he just got easier			2
i think part of it was down to his intelligence			0
he was such a quick learner and , by the end of it , i 'd just push a button and he 'd go			0
there was never once a time when i thought he 'd lose			0
" life after @entity3 has changed markedly for @entity28 and those around him			1
after @entity18 passed away , aged 70 , @entity28 -- who had been the official jockey at the trainer 's @entity125 stables in @entity127 -- has since opted to go freelance			1
a once great team has dissipated but @entity3 lives on , as does the memory of what he achieved			2
@entity28 's home is littered with memories of him , from the trophies to photographs of the pair 's famous victories			1
however , @entity28 has seen him just once since their final day in action together , but there remains an indelible bond between jockey and horse			1
" i know it sounds strange but we got on well , " he says			0
" i 'd chat to him a lot when racing , trying to relax him or maybe just me			0
" it seemed important as there was always such hype when we raced			0
i would n't say there was pressure as i was always happy on his back , and really i always knew the result			0
" but the issue for @entity28 is that he has achieved his career high , at least in terms of the absolute class of the horse that follows him			1
however , he now distances himself from that earlier " anticlimax " comment			0
" there 's an element of anticlimax in that they 'll never be another one like him , but then there 's two other parts , " he explains			0
" one is that i was very lucky to have ridden him in the first place but the other thing is that i have other career goals			0
" as a freelance rider , you hope to get some top rides			0
basically how it works is my agent will get contacted about certain rides and then they get lined up			0
i still want to compete in the top races immaterial of who i 'm riding , to win things like the @entity183			0
" i 'm looking forward to that and , in some ways , winning the races and championships tops what 's gone before			0
" however , one thing he is aware of is that should he ride another trailblazer of the track , the comparisons will inevitably come to the fore			0
" i know that the first question i 'll be asked about will always be @entity3 , " he says			2
" and i 'm okay with that			0

it is 18 months since wonder horse @entity3 retired from racing
jockey @entity28 admits he will never ride another like the " @entity32 of racing "
@entity28 has visited @entity3 just once but has moved on , targeting wins not horses
@entity3 's trainer @entity18 , who died last year , called him " the best i 've ever seen "
