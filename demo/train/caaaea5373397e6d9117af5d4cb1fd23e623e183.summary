-- you can not look away from the twin disasters befalling the people of @entity4 and @entity5			1
that is what president @entity7 has realized			1
more than three years after an uprising to topple @entity4 dictator @entity10 spun into a devastating civil war , @entity7 is asking @entity12 for $ 500 million to help arm and train the moderate @entity4 opposition			1
more than 150,000 @entity4 have already died			1
it 's a staggering number			2
and the situation is only getting worse			2
now @entity5 , too , has become a battleground for sectarian conflict , threatening to create an even larger regional catastrophe			1
competing groups and battling ideologies are at war , and the most extreme are fighting vigorously and making gains			2
there 's no question that this is the most complicated of conflicts			2
three - dimensional chess does not begin to describe it			2
but there is also no question that all the wrong people are winning			2
that 's partly because those with moderate ideology have not received any support while others are bolstered by outside backers			2
@entity41 , whose downfall seemed all but certain , receives military support from @entity43 and ground forces from @entity45 , @entity47 's @entity43 - allied @entity46 militia , which has helped him turn the tide in the battlefield			0
@entity7 threatened to intervene after @entity10 used chemical weapons , but backed away after a chemical disarmament deal , but @entity10 continues to slaughter civilians by the thousands			1
the rebels seeking to topple @entity10 , meanwhile , are deeply divided and are fighting each other			0
moderates have lost ground to @entity60 extremists , who receive support from @entity63 donors			2
the @entity64 , an @entity66 arm in @entity4 , has broken with @entity67 , the @entity68 in @entity5 and @entity4			1
it is @entity67 , whose brutality even @entity66 considers excessive , that has swept across the @entity4 border into @entity5			1
the more fanatical the group , the better it is doing			0
the radicals ' advances attract more support and make their ideology more appealing , which strengthens their numbers			0
and groups like @entity67 , now flush with cash , have no intention of stopping their expansion			1
now the war in @entity4 has spilled in the worst possible way into @entity5 , not only threatening the survival of that country but creating the very real possibility that a radical @entity60 state of the most extremist kind could take root across both @entity4 and @entity5 , creating a base of operations for attacks on @entity96 allies , with @entity97 first in line , and for terrorist training and planning			1
there 's no question that finding " moderates " is a very difficult task			0
and it 's certainly true that @entity7 's plan to start arming the moderate opposition is risky			1
the weapons could fall into the wrong hands , as they have in the past , and stepping even indirectly into a sectarian war is a perilous proposition			0
but this conflict has made even the most pessimistic prediction appear hopelessly optimistic			0
some experts are calling this @entity116 crisis the most dangerous one in 40 years			0
the scale of human suffering is staggering , and the stakes for long - term global stability enormous			0
the @entity122 's decision to stand on the sidelines has allowed the worst outcome to materialize			0
and it is morally indefensible			0
the @entity5 quandary now makes it all even more complicated			1
the @entity96 does not want to take sides in a @entity130 - @entity46 war			0
@entity96 's interest is a return to peace and victory for those -- in @entity4 and @entity5 -- who would protect human rights and rule of law			1
@entity139 is sending 300 advisers to work with the ( mostly @entity46 ) @entity5 army			1
now it will help arm the ( mostly @entity130 ) moderate opposition in @entity4			1
it is walking gingerly , projecting its nonsectarian position , as it should			0
the turbulent @entity116 may look like a distant , foggy disaster area , but it has a history of sending ripples that reach close to home , changing life for people in other parts of the world			0
already the war in @entity4 has attracted fighters from @entity158 countries , from @entity159 and the @entity96			1
@entity4 and now @entity5 are becoming training grounds for would - be terrorists			1
@entity159 security agencies are sounding panicked about what this means for terrorism at home			0
" the threat of attack has never been greater , " one @entity159 counterterrorism official said			0
@entity171 director @entity170 said thousands of @entity159 have traveled to @entity4 to fight with @entity172			1
dozens of @entity96 have joined them			0
an @entity96 suicide bomber -- from @entity175 -- blew himself up in @entity4 recently			1
some of those violent jihadists with @entity96 and @entity159 passports , which allow them to travel easily almost anywhere , are returning home			0
a @entity181 citizen just back from @entity4 has been charged with killing four people in @entity184 ' @entity183			1
bomb threats , like one a few days ago in @entity186 , are being treated extremely seriously			0
the @entity188 intelligence service says @entity188 jihadis are returning to the @entity188 , bringing dangerous ideological baggage , determined to commit attacks on the @entity122 and radicalize @entity188 muslims			0
@entity194 prime minister @entity193 calls the terrorist threat from @entity4 " the biggest risk we face			2
" as counterterrorism officials in the @entity96 and @entity159 try to prevent attacks , the fighting in @entity4 and @entity5 is destroying lives , creating a generation of traumatized people who may seek revenge , perpetuating this conflict and threatening to tear apart the @entity116			1
millions have been forced to leave their homes			0
each individual in @entity5 or @entity4 who has left home , each child who has been displaced by the war , has endured experiences we can scarcely comprehend			1
it may be easier to look away , to say the problem is just too complicated , and that it 's not ours to deal with			0
but the humanitarian , strategic and security ramifications have become impossible to ignore			2
@entity7 discovered he can not look away			2

president @entity7 is asking @entity12 for $ 500 million to aid @entity4 opposition
@entity223 : @entity7 realized he can not ignore the twin disasters in @entity4 and @entity5
she says the brutal @entity67 has swept across the @entity4 border into @entity5 , creating havoc
@entity230 : the violence opens the possibility that radical extremists will *spread* in the region
