-- the @entity1 is one of the most powerful tools on the planet			1
across the globe , millions of people connect every minute of every day to harness its wealth of information , exchange ideas in an open platform and foster the type of innovation and entrepreneurship that spurs economic growth			1
and today , it 's never been more at risk in the @entity18			2
earlier this year , a court decision unlocked the " pandora 's box			2
" there are now no enforceable rules to ensure small businesses , nonprofits and individuals can continue to access online content without fear of discriminatory practices or content blocking by internet service providers who own the information pipelines			0
indeed , without new rules , service providers could create fast lanes , impose new fees , and even block certain content and promote other content to bolster their bottom line			1
this would destroy the open internet as we know it			1
this is not idle speculation			0
executives at cable and phone companies have expressed a desire to engage in such activities , and in fact , have already tried to do so			0
if we permit blocking , discrimination , and tolls , we will undermine the @entity1 's low - cost level playing field that has transformed our society , created an economic boom , and provided opportunity to so many in the @entity18 and around the world			1
in the last few decades , we have seen first - hand how the open @entity1 has led to a robust startup economy where @entity18 create content , solve problems and pioneer new technologies that improve the lives of people across the globe			1
businesses like @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and more have emerged because they were able to start on an even playing field , where consumers -- not internet service providers -- determined their success			0
degrading service or forcing businesses to pay - to - play would fundamentally undermine the openness and access on which the @entity1 has thrived			2
to allow the @entity1 to become a bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers would be a mistake of historic proportions			2
instead , it must remain a place where all speakers , creators and innovators can harness its transformative power now and in the future			0
fortunately , we do not need to create new laws or a complex regulatory structure to preserve the internet as we know it			0
instead , the @entity95 can pass rules that prevent toll booths , content blocking and discrimination by simply reclassifying broadband as a common carrier service under @entity102 of the @entity103			2
all the @entity95 would be doing is applying the legal framework that @entity105 expected it to apply , and that both @entity107 justice @entity106 and president @entity108 agree is the correct approach			2
in other words , the legal tools are there and ready to use			0
some worry that this approach could be overly burdensome on internet service providers , but the fact is , the @entity95 can easily apply only the necessary parts of @entity102 regulation through a process known as forbearance			2
this flexible approach would allow the @entity95 to adopt bright - line rules that provide certainty to the market , and would keep the internet as a powerful , open platform that gives everyone -- not just the highest - bidder -- the opportunity to freely exchange goods and ideas			1
any approach that stops short of reclassifying broadband under @entity102 will not allow the @entity95 to adopt the rules we need today to protect customers and businesses , and will result in high social and economic costs			1
all other approaches require case - by - case adjudication , leading to never - ending litigation ( which , in itself , disproportionately harms small businesses and start - ups ) , market uncertainty , high costs of regulation and opportunities for regulatory overreach			0
@entity149 has already worked well to strengthen telecommunications in the @entity18			0
under @entity149 regulation , telephone service has been robust and accessible			0
mobile phone service , also a @entity149 service , continues to thrive and investment has remained steady and more and more individuals turn to mobile as their primary voice service			0
while many do not realize it , @entity102 also applies to the broadband services offered to the nation 's large businesses , known as enterprise broadband , and to the many services offered to millions of our rural @entity18			0
an open @entity1 is not only essential for the future of @entity18 's economic growth , but it is also a ladder for social and economic mobility , allowing families in rural or low - income areas to access educational and social services , participate in our democracy and contribute to the marketplace of ideas			1
this is why we have been working with our colleagues in @entity105 to encourage the @entity95 to protect the open internet under @entity181 adopting these sensible rules would give the @entity95 the power to intervene if broadband providers attempt to abuse the principles of the open internet while also creating market and regulatory certainty			1
we are proud to join more than 4 million @entity18 of all political beliefs , as well as companies in our home states and across the country , who have spoken out in favor of strong open @entity1 rules and against the creation of fast and slow lanes			1
we urge the @entity95 to act quickly to implement fair rules of the road that protect businesses and consumers and preserve the power of the open @entity1			1
the future of our democracy and economy depend on it .			0

@entity207 , @entity208 : internet is the most powerful tool in the world , but it 's at risk
@entity207 , @entity208 : if the @entity95 makes the *wrong* decision , it would kill net *neutrality*
they say fast lanes would destroy the open @entity1 , increase discrimination and prices
@entity207 , @entity208 : an open @entity1 promotes economic growth , social and economic mobility
