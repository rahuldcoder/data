desperately pursuing a nuclear deal with @entity4 , scrapping old positions and offering new concessions at a mind - boggling pace , the @entity1 administration has lost sight of what this regime represents and why the @entity12 and its allies have focused on its nuclear program to begin with			1
for more than a decade , @entity12 leaders vowed to prevent @entity4 from acquiring or developing the technology and know - how of nuclear weaponry for a simple reason : we did not want one of the world 's most dangerous regimes to possess ( and potentially use or distribute ) the world 's most dangerous weapons			2
that 's why , starting under president @entity28 , @entity27 rallied the international community around increasingly tough sanctions that would remain in place until @entity32 comes clean about its nuclear program and the world could rest assured that it would not develop nuclear weaponry			2
to his credit , president @entity1 led global efforts to further tighten the screws on @entity4 , which threatened that nation with economic collapse and coaxed @entity4 leaders to the negotiating table			0
nevertheless , the president now seems prepared to ink a deal that would put @entity4 on the cusp of nuclear weaponry and eventually lift all sanctions , raising the same specter of a very dangerous regime with the most dangerous weapons -- even though the regime has not changed its ideology , its motives , or its behavior in any significant way since the @entity52 was founded in 1979			1
as @entity1 has suggested in public comments , the administration envisions that , with a nuclear deal , @entity4 can emerge from the isolation in which the sanctions have put it and take its rightful place as a responsible player in the @entity60 , working with other nations to stabilize the region			1
from its earliest days , however , and through two @entity63 and multiple presidents , the regime in @entity32 has been expansionist in the region and beyond , destabilizing of its neighbors , murderous in its activities , and , most fundamentally , anti-american in its approach			2
" @entity79 " has remained a popular chant at parliamentary sessions and government - orchestrated public rallies			0
nothing of late suggests that @entity32 will change for the better after a nuclear deal			1
in fact , a deal of the kind that @entity12 and @entity4 negotiators are pursuing , which will delay the onset of @entity4 nuclear weaponry rather than prevent it , will give the regime greater leverage to pursue its dangerous activities			1
for starters , @entity4 remains the world 's most aggressive state sponsor of terrorism , as our @entity94 continually attests , fueling the murderous efforts of @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , and other groups that have killed @entity12 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and others			0
and according to @entity105 's @entity104 , it has worked with @entity106 since 2007 to target @entity12 interests in @entity108 and @entity109			0
under the emerging deal , @entity4 has not vowed to stop sponsoring those groups			2
indeed , nuclear weaponry will position @entity4 to even more effectively rebuff @entity12 and other outside pressure to halt its terror sponsorship , and it will enable the regime , if it chooses , to put nuclear weapons in the hands of those groups			2
meanwhile , @entity4 's leaders continue to threaten to eliminate @entity102 , the region 's lone democracy and @entity12 's closest ally , and , under the emerging deal , @entity32 has not promised to halt those threats			1
nuclear weaponry , when combined with @entity4 's growing ballistic missile program ( which the emerging deal will not affect ) , will position @entity32 to make good on its threats -- or to hold that threat over @entity127 when it seeks to confront @entity4 - backed terrorists who are launching rockets , building tunnels , or killing soldiers across its borders			1
finally , @entity4 continues to pull out all stops to protect @entity135 's murderous dictator , @entity134 , by sending forces to help @entity135 's army fight the @entity12 - backed rebels			0
it 's also extending its reach in the region by , for instance , backing the anti-american @entity143 rebels who recently overran @entity145 's capital and forced its @entity12 - backed president to resign			0
@entity4 , it seems , is unwilling to abandon its hegemonic dreams , which threaten @entity12 's position in the region			0
by better protecting @entity4 from outside pressure , a nuclear deal also will strengthen the regime at home , enabling it to further crack down on activists who seek a more democratic government			1
that , in turn , will extend the time during which the world 's most dangerous weapons will remain in the hands of a regime that 's driven by fervent anti-americanism			0
by speeding blindly toward a deal , @entity12 's leaders are , put simply , ignoring the many real dangers that @entity32 presents to @entity12 interests			0
