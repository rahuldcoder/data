@entity1 , @entity0 -- the war in @entity0 may no longer be forgotten but the true victims always are			1
having been denied healthcare and education under the @entity8 , @entity0 women are now training as midwives women and children in the landlocked @entity13 country have continuously paid the ultimate price throughout the decades of conflict and war			1
it is their lives that are considered not precious enough to save			1
a woman here dies every 29 minutes due to childbirth complications , according to the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) -- one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world			1
one in four children die before they reach the age of five because of the lack of health care and medical facilities in their cities and villages			1
but ignorance is also deadly			0
misguided cultural pride prevents men from allowing their women to see a doctor , merely because the doctor could be male			2
and in many cases , it 's not just women who die from childbirth - related issues			1
it is young girls forced into marriage before they even reach puberty			0
their still - forming bodies can not handle the complications of childbirth			2
but there are women in @entity0 stepping up within the crowds of the forgotten and pushing past the barriers			1
they are training as midwives across the country to help bring change and save lives			1
" a woman can help a woman more , " midwifery student @entity59 told @entity2			2
" we have to introduce them with what to do , what foods to eat , how to take care of themselves			0
" [ we ] tell their husbands how to treat them			0
there are some husbands who beat their wives to the point where they can no longer even get pregnant			0
" at the @entity75 in @entity1 , dozens of future midwives study and practise in the hope of bringing a brighter future to their countrywomen			1
" it 's very heartbreaking , " @entity59 said of the situation women face			2
" @entity0 has gone through so much war and most girls were not allowed to get an education , so i want to study and bring forth something new			2
" sympathy for @entity0 women is the strongest motivating force among students in this field : many know personally what is like to live in a society where pregnant women are ignored and forgotten			1
" we live in an area where we are far from any clinic or hospital and there are a lot of difficulties there for pregnant women , " @entity97 , a student and mother , told @entity2			2
" it 's very difficult for them to reach a hospital			0
this is why i was so keen in learning this profession and helping these women ; so in the future they are in less danger			2
" all the women here are training with the permission and support of their families			0
they are leading the way to a brighter tomorrow for @entity0 women -- one that may one day catch up with the rest of the world			1
" the world is moving forward and he did n't want me to sit around jobless , " said future midwife , @entity126 whose husband is supportive of her new career			0
" he wanted me to push ahead in this field , especially a field in which our people need help in			0
" there are still many obstacles left and these women are still in the minority			0
according to the @entity142 there are only about 2,000 trained midwives servicing @entity0 's population of just under 33 million			1
but that is a giant leap from just eight years ago when most women were denied an education , medical care and the basic necessities of survival under the @entity8 regime			0
it will take many years to change mindsets instilled by decades of brutality			0
but these women prove that maybe , just maybe , the next generation can fix the mistakes of the last .			0

@entity0 has one of the highest rates of maternal and *infant* mortality in the world
a woman dies in childbirth every 29 minutes , one in four children die before age 5
