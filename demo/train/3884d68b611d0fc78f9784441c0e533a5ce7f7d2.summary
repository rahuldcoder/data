-- the budget battles continue to rage			1
every time the @entity2 and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins			2
at best , the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions , temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional			1
at worst , the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or @entity2 will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks			2
the impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy			0
few dispute that our budget process is broken			1
but the nation is so buried in the weeds , trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle , that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process			1
partisan strategy is one of the main culprits			0
polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on @entity34			0
but in recent years , republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff @entity40 presidents			1
the strategy has deep roots			0
in 1966 and 1967 , conservative @entity43 and @entity45 @entity44 focused attention on the rising deficits to force president @entity48 to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end			1
in 1995 and 1996 , @entity44 shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts			1
even after the backlash helped president @entity56 regain his political standing , which had plummeted after the 1994 election , the @entity44 continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of @entity56 's term , leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands			1
since 2010 , a growing number of @entity44 have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force president @entity67 's hand on this issue			1
they have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default			2
to be sure there have been moments when @entity43 have challenged @entity44 presidents as well			1
the difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about @entity44 policies , whereas the new generation of @entity44 appears willing to follow through on the threat			1
in a recent interview with the @entity88 , @entity86 @entity44 @entity85 lambasted his colleagues , calling sen. @entity91 's recent tactics , " a form of governmental terrorism			1
" another reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because , historically , once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic , the practice can become normalized			1
the best example is the filibuster			0
there was a time when members of the @entity105 were reluctant to use the filibuster frequently			2
they reserved it for high - profile issues , like civil rights , believing that ordinarily a majority should be sufficient to pass legislation			0
but since the 1970s , the filibuster has become a routine weapon in partisan combat			2
senators have been willing to threaten or use the filibuster more frequently , and to do so on rather mundane issues			0
the result has been that the @entity105 became a chamber where a supermajority is required on most issues			0
we 're seeing a similar dynamic with the budget			2
whereas threatening a government shutdown was once seen as a highly dramatic act , in the current environment there are many legislators who seem to view it as a legitimate part of congressional debate			1
while there was a time when legislators warned that they would not vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling only when they knew that @entity2 was going to raise the debt ceiling , now more legislators are open to following through on the threat that the debt limit increase wo n't pass			1
each time that they do it , the threat becomes more familiar , and more accepted by some			2
finally , the budget wars are fueled by the 24 - hour news media , with outlets on cable television and the internet that are constantly in search of dramatic stories to win attention			2
the budget war offers great fodder			0
the possibility of a fiscal cliff offers political junkies a bit of the kind of thrill that " @entity164 " fans have felt every time @entity166 extricates himself from another bind			0
as a result , legislators such as @entity91 , who gained considerable attention over the past few weeks for his dramatic stand against @entity171 , are making a name for themselves and staying in the headlines			0
the budget process might not be good for the nation , but it is certainly a great way for a politician to receive attention			1
at some point there will be pressure to reform the process			0
the latest round of budget battles led a larger number of @entity44 , like sen. @entity187 , to be openly critical of their colleagues and call for a very different approach			1
as representative @entity85 , an opponent of the @entity171 , explained , " i still think we should try to repeal the bill			0
but you repeal it the same way you passed it			0
you get bills through both houses of @entity2 , and you get the president to sign it			0
" budget reform is possible			0
for instance , there has been some discussion about the possibility of repealing the need for a congressional vote to raise the debt ceiling			0
there have been several moments in @entity211 history , such as in 1921 and 1974 , when @entity2 overhauled the entire budget process			1
it might be time to start that debate again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : budget battles *reoccur* *regularly* , and each time seems worse
@entity44 have used the weapon of a shutdown to *cripple* @entity40 presidents , he says
@entity218 : when a tactic such as threatening to veto debt limit increase is used , it becomes the new normal
he says some in @entity44 are outraged , and now is a good time to talk about reforming budget process
