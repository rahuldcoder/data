the winter sun was low in the sky on @entity3 's @entity2 when the $ 650,000 @entity4 driven by @entity5 skidded into a tree and burst into flames			2
the @entity9 - connected tycoon and his passenger -- glamorous @entity12 tv anchor @entity11 -- were pulled out of the wreckage by passersby			1
@entity5 was badly burned and in critical condition			0
barely alive , he was flown by helicopter to a hospital in nearby @entity18 and placed in intensive care			0
the year was 2006 and that november had brought stormy skies to the @entity21 , a known playground for @entity24 's jet - setting elite			2
@entity5 survived but the incident left senior staffers at @entity27 -- a bank which does business with some of @entity12 's richest individuals and their companies -- deeply unsettled			1
now , as @entity27 ' investment banking practices come under the spotlight with inquiries into its rigging of @entity37 , the @entity5 episode provides echoes from the past			1
warnings to staff soon after the oligarch 's accident @entity42 , chairman of the firm 's @entity45 -- or @entity45 -- unit and its main powerbroker for @entity12 , put in a call to @entity5 's right - hand man @entity50			1
he wanted an update on the magnate 's health			0
the next day , around 25 staff working on @entity12 deals at @entity45 's @entity57 office in @entity58 were summoned to a meeting			2
one banker present recalls @entity42 using the @entity5 case as an example of why employees should ensure they conduct appropriate due diligence on clients			0
the banker did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks			0
" ask yourselves , " that banker says @entity42 told them			0
" who are these people ? where does their money come from ? and where is it held in the event they pass away ? " @entity27 declined to provide details of its dealings with @entity5 or its lending to @entity12 as a whole , for reasons of confidentiality			1
emails and calls to the magnate 's @entity86 went unanswered			0
soon after the @entity5 affair @entity42 spoke with @entity89 , then @entity45 president and future chief operating officer for the @entity27 group			2
@entity93 's team was ordered to minimize risks by cutting the value of the bank 's equity swaps with @entity12 counterparties			1
@entity27 's @entity12 links @entity5 -- branded the " secret oligarch " by the @entity100 -- was born in @entity101 , a republic in @entity12 's @entity102			1
two decades of heavy borrowing and investing in @entity12 blue chips have helped the 46 - year - old to chart a course from the factory floor to the @entity111 rich list			1
latest estimates put his fortune at $ 6.5 billion			0
oligarchs like @entity5 often obtain access to such leverage by pledging shares as collateral			0
the returns on such business -- called margin lending -- can be tantalizingly lucrative , but dangerous in default			0
@entity27 would not say whether it had entered into such transactions with @entity5 or other oligarchs but a person familiar with the matter said the activity was commonplace for a top - tier investment bank			1
@entity45 : loss and scandal @entity130 was @entity27 ' chief executive back in 1998 , the year @entity12 could n't pay back its debts			1
@entity130 , writing in the @entity100 this month , revealed @entity45 traders had built up a large , unauthorized exposure to the country 's bond markets , incurring the bank substantial losses and making the firm look " reckless " in the eyes of regulators			1
@entity27 declined to comment on @entity130 's statement when contacted by @entity142 but the company 's annual report for the year shows @entity45 swung to a £ 265 million loss ( $ 414 million ) from a profit of £ 252 million ( $ 394 million ) the year before			1
the publication cited the @entity12 economic crisis for the shortfall			2
@entity130 said he spoke up now because of " striking parallels " between that event and the bank 's recent " lowballing ' " of @entity37 -- a key benchmark interest rate upon which trillions of dollars of financial contracts are priced			1
@entity27 , whose admission to the @entity37 manipulation earned it a record $ 453 million penalty , took out advertisements in the @entity163 press this week to reassure people it was " truly sorry for what has happened			1
" in the message , outgoing chairman @entity166 promised the organization would not allow itself to be " distracted from what really matters -- delivering for [ customers and clients ]			0
" from @entity12 with risk when @entity27 got burned on @entity12 fourteen years ago @entity173 was running the @entity45 unit -- a job he held until being promoted to group chief executive in 2011			1
@entity130 , who has long since left the company , says he wished he had fired @entity173 when he had the opportunity , but was swayed by the latter 's insistence he was unaware of the wrongdoing			0
besides , the @entity182 swore he " loved @entity27 , " a defense repeated twice by the 60 - year - old this month during his testimony to a parliamentary committee			1
@entity173 resigned this july on the same day as @entity89 saying the external pressure placed on the bank had " reached a level that risks damaging the franchise			0
" a spokesman for @entity173 declined to comment on @entity130 's remarks			0
fast cars and football clubs @entity5 is unlikely to be the only client to have given @entity27 cause for reflection			2
but he symbolizes its close ties with @entity12 and the relationship sheds light on the intensely private world of @entity27 ' investment arm at a time when such banks -- which also manage consumer savings -- are under pressure to be more transparent			1
those ties reach to the top of the organization ; @entity42 , for example , acts as vice-chair of @entity12 's state controlled oil giant @entity215 alongside his chairmanship of @entity45			2
at the height of the 2008 financial crisis , when other @entity163 banks like @entity220 had to accept government bailouts , @entity27 turned to the emerging markets for funds			2
among the institutions it approached was @entity9 - controlled @entity225 , according to the banker			0
instead it sold a stake to sovereign wealth funds in the @entity229 of @entity230 and @entity231			0
@entity5 , a @entity232 speaker who avoids the limelight , surfaced on the international stage last year when his @entity236 soccer team bought former @entity238 striker @entity237 for a reported $ 30 million , cementing his oligarch status alongside the likes of @entity242 owner @entity241 and @entity244 's @entity243			2
off the pitch , @entity5 also plays a high - stakes game			1
his holdings -- past and present -- in some of the world 's largest companies , like @entity249 and @entity250 , have seen him make and lose billions at a time , only to resurface rich once more thanks to his propensity to convince banks to extend him credit			0
in 2008 alone , the father of three 's net worth plummeted from $ 14.4 billion to just $ 3.1 billion , according to @entity111			0
four years later his fortune had doubled again			0
at one point @entity27 even tried to tap @entity5 for money by encouraging the oligarch to buy into a placement of its shares offered to fifty select parties , according to another banker with knowledge of the issue			2
that individual says @entity5 did not make the purchase , though @entity27 ' pitch exemplifies the close links its top personnel enjoy with some of the world 's wealthiest and least - known people			1
tendency to push the limits this week @entity277 , head of the @entity163 's @entity278 , told @entity163 parliamentarians that @entity27 had a " cultural tendency to be always pushing the limits			2
" that tendency , it seems , has been there for some time			0
@entity130 stood down from the top job at @entity27 in 1998 , after clashing with the board over the " risk shadow , " he says @entity45 was exerting on the rest of the enterprise			1
a decade later a @entity163 government - commissioned report -- partially written by @entity130 - formally recommended banks separate their retail and investment divisions			0
but for all the theory , @entity27 ' detractors have yet to acknowledge that the bank 's riskier division provides the bulk of the firm 's profit			1
without the cash it generates the company 's balance sheet would look very different			0
diamond , was once described by @entity163 's former trade secretary , @entity304 , as the " unacceptable face of banking " for his generous pay packets and unapologetic stance after the credit crunch			0
he turned @entity27 into the one of the most successful financial institutions in the @entity163 and part of that plan involved bringing in @entity42 to build up its capital markets - or client funding - operations and target prospects such as @entity5			2
bereft of its investment banking veterans like @entity319 and with its top management in turmoil , the challenge for @entity27 ' new guard will be to balance its legacy as a trusted , household name with the febrile hunt for returns -- be they in @entity12 or elsewhere .			1

the 2006 crash of a @entity329 *prompted* @entity27 to reassess its @entity12 exposure
@entity27 ' links to @entity12 caused it pain when the country defaulted in 1998
despite this , @entity27 complex lending and high stakes deal - making continued
the bank is now facing further *scrutiny* after its @entity37 fixing cost it $ 453 million in fines
