-- for the 10 days of the @entity3 , @entity2 's @entity1 is transformed into @entity4			1
celebrities are gifted with everything from laptop computers ( courtesy @entity8 ) to moccasins ( @entity10 ) , headphones ( @entity11 ) , boots ( @entity14 ) and wireless chargers ( @entity16 )			0
@entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 were among the stars who picked up @entity23 products , gratis			2
and @entity24 handed out winter gear to the likes of @entity27 and @entity28			0
with so much gifting going on , it 's not uncommon on the streets of @entity1 to see celebrities ( or , more often , their assistants ) toting armfuls of goods			2
but this @entity3 has witnessed a new phenomenon : famous faces giving away the very things they 've just received for free			1
@entity39 partnered with the @entity40 on a " reverse gifting " suite on @entity42 , where stars were encouraged to donate their newly acquired freebies to benefit the victims of @entity46			1
actor @entity47 surrendered a pair of @entity50 jeans he 'd just received			0
he admitted that he did n't feel entirely comfortable accepting swag in the first place			0
" you come to a festival like this and people give you stuff , which is very lovely , " he said			0
" i always feel very guilty			0
" @entity58 , who stars with @entity59 in the @entity3 movie " @entity61 , " said she wo n't take swag as a matter of principle			1
with no freebies to donate , she instead signed a snowboard to be auctioned for @entity46 relief			2
down the street from the " reverse gifting " suite , stars could accept swag knowing they would not be the sole beneficiaries of that largesse			1
@entity73 , one of the brands featured in a gifting lounge created by @entity76 , announced that for every coat it gave to a celebrity , it would donate another coat to the charity @entity82			0
coats given to @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 ( to name a few ) resulted in items being donated to those in need			0
but in the end , only a small percentage of the swag handed out at @entity3 is likely to wind up benefiting charities , whether it 's @entity82 or the @entity40			1
a publicist for the @entity39 reverse gifting lounge conceded that donations this year were modest			1
" we did n't get too many of the high - dollar donations we were looking for , " the publicist wrote in an e-mail			0
she attributed the underwhelming response to it " being the first year ( for the reverse gifting lounge ) and an idea that came together shortly before @entity3			2
" so for charities hoping for a share of @entity3 swag -- and celebrities warming to the idea of giving up their free goods -- there may be more hope for next year .			1
