@entity0 -- the health of several of the world 's biggest banks has been called into question following the decision by @entity7 's to downgrade their credit ratings			1
in all , 15 institutions were downgraded after @entity11 closed thursday , including @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
" all of the banks affected by today 's actions have significant exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized losses inherent to capital markets activities , " @entity7 's global banking managing director @entity27 said in a statement			1
how the major banks are affected the banks were unimpressed with the move , with many questioning how the ratings agencies make their decisions			0
@entity16 called its two - notch downgrade " arbitrary and completely unwarranted , " according to @entity42			0
so how did the global economy become so dependent on the opinions of three companies ? who are the credit rating agencies ? the " big three " are @entity48 's , @entity7 and @entity49			1
all originated in the @entity51 , although @entity49 has dual headquarters in @entity53 and @entity54			0
what do they do ? before you can get a credit card , banks run a credit check on you			0
similarly , the ratings agencies run credit checks on companies , countries and financial products -- and banks themselves			1
the agencies assess their the ability to pay off loans or investments and then rate them on a sliding scale , ranging from @entity72 to @entity73 in the case of government bonds , anything that slips to bb + , as was the case with crisis - hit @entity78 , is considered a " highly speculative " investment : or " junk bonds " in the parlance of the markets			2
stocks plunge on downgrade fears in the context of thursday 's announcement , @entity7 's grouped the 15 banks into three categories based on their credit worthiness			1
@entity14 , @entity19 and the @entity26 made up the top group , which @entity7 's said had solid capital buffers and " contained " exposure to the @entity94 crisis			1
the second group included @entity13 , @entity24 , @entity18 , @entity23 , @entity22 , @entity20 , @entity25 and @entity21			0
@entity7 's said these firms had varying risk factors , from high dependence on capital markets operations to limited liquidity and exposure to @entity94			1
@entity12 , @entity16 , @entity15 , and @entity17 ( @entity17 ) made up the bottom -- and weakest -- group of banks			0
@entity7 's said these companies experienced problems with volatility and risk management , while their financial " shock absorbers " are in some cases thinner or less reliable than their peers			1
@entity20 took the biggest hit from the @entity7 's announcement , suffering a three - notch downgrade , just days after @entity116 's central bank warned it to bolster its capital			2
what does a debt rating downgrade mean ? banks could see their costs rise as it becomes more expensive for them to borrow money			0
officially they are now a riskier proposition for lenders because of their exposure to events such as the @entity94 debt crisis			0
these additional costs -- potentially billions of dollars -- could eventually be passed to the banks ' customers through higher interest rates on loans and mortgages			0
why do the agencies wield such power ? investors across the world look to credit ratings agencies to judge where to place their bets in the market			1
for governments , the ratings agencies have a lot of power over the popularity of bonds : cash given to governments like @entity78 by investors that , over time , will pay a return on the original investment -- unless the government defaults			0
the downgrade of @entity78 signaled @entity48 's belief that @entity78 has a higher likelihood to default on investments			1
it caused investors to lose their appetite to invest in bonds from @entity78 , which imperils the nation 's ability to pay down its deficit			2
how are ratings agencies paid ? historically , they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings			2
in the 1970s , however , credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings			2
in 1975 , @entity51 legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated @entity48 's , @entity7 's and @entity49 as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products			1
what are the complaints against the firms ? critics complain the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge the risk on certain investments -- especially in light of @entity72 ratings given to mortgage - backed securities that imploded when defaults on @entity51 home loans shot up , triggering the 2008 financial crisis			1
critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate , raising questions about their trustworthiness			0
lawmakers in the @entity51 , the @entity202 and other countries around the world are now reviewing regulations on the credit ratings agencies			0
credit ratings agencies , too , have revamped their procedures and have argued their ratings are merely opinions -- it 's up to the markets to decide .			2

" @entity214 " are @entity48 's , @entity7 and @entity49
critics say the agencies have lost their ability to independently judge risk on certain investments
agencies say they only give opinions on credit ; *choices* *ultimately* up to investors
15 of the world 's biggest banks downgraded *due* to exposure to global financial crisis
