-- you should n't put all your eggs in one basket , but @entity5 @entity4 are willing to put a few into a neighborhood dispute involving chickens and @entity12 @entity11 candidate @entity10 's yard			1
it should be something that went no further than a community newsletter , but one of the neighbors is @entity10 , a @entity18 congressman who grew up and owns a home in the @entity21 neighborhood			1
the others are @entity23 and her four chickens , which run freely into both backyards , sometimes leaving evidence of their cross-property line roaming			1
with primary over , @entity11 race gets ugly it 's that evidence -- chicken stuff -- that made @entity10 and his wife cry fowl			1
@entity34 said she was surprised to learn in may about a complaint the @entity37 lodged with the @entity38			2
" mrs. @entity39 was out with her lawnmower , and i thought , because i do this with all my neighbors , i 'd give them fresh , organic eggs , " @entity34 told @entity0			0
" i had offered them to her and she says , ' i ca n't accept them because i 've filed a formal complaint against you			2
' and that was the first i ever heard of it , so i just went ahead and said , ' ok , ' you know , i took my eggs back			0
" @entity34 says the chickens were approved by the homeowners association because she uses them for therapeutic purposes as a court - appointed child advocate			2
an attorney for the housing association wrote an email to the board in may , which a @entity4 media outlet obtained and printed , saying the congressman wants to avoid a " litigious situation , " but that the chickens " should not be permitted			0
" @entity0 reached out to the attorney to confirm the authenticity of the email , but he declined to speak on the matter			0
in response to the complaint , @entity34 built a pen for the chickens , though " in the evenings , yes , i do let them run in my yard , " she said			2
while she watches them as they roam , they sometimes cross onto the @entity10 property			2
@entity4 have seized on the situation , saying @entity10 , a trial lawyer , is threatening to sue @entity34 , a military veteran , which is not in true " @entity5 nice " fashion			1
@entity10 has denied the accusation , and no suit has been filed			1
first lady to campaign for @entity88 in tight @entity11 race " it 's just one of those ridiculous election - year political things that comes up , " @entity10 told @entity0			1
" nobody in @entity5 cares about chickens at @entity21 in terms of how it 's going to affect their vote in the @entity11			1
what they care about is what you do , and what you can bring to the table to make their lives better because they care about the future			0
" @entity10 may be right			0
while this issue has been in the news for months , the latest @entity0 poll from @entity5 shows him deadlocked with his opponent , @entity4 state sen. @entity110 , 49 % to 48 % , respectively , within the poll 's margin of error			1
previously polls have found the same result , or had a slight edge for @entity110			0
@entity0 has found no reliable polling on the chicken dispute			0
" what 's so strange about this story is it 's an example of where , when somebody else 's animals are in your yard , you 're the bad neighbor , " @entity10 said			1
as for @entity34 , a longtime @entity88 who says she 's voted for @entity10 in all four of his previous congressional races , the chicken dispute has n't cost him her vote yet			1
" i am weighing my options , " she said			0
" it gives me some thoughts to ponder			0
i would n't necessarily say i would n't vote for him because of just this			0
" @entity0 chief congressional correspondent @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
