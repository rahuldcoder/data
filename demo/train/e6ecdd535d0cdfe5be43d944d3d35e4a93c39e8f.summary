-- what if , instead of climbing @entity2 to receive the @entity3 from @entity4 , @entity1 had turned to the @entity6 and asked : hey , what do you guys think we should do ? considering the @entity13 ' bad behavior in the @entity14 , what with the coveting of neighbors ' wives and murdering their own brothers , that might have been a disastrous idea			1
but in our own more enlightened age , we 're perfectly capable of crowdsourcing our own commandments -- or , at least , that 's what a new project would have us believe			1
@entity26 , an executive at @entity28 , and @entity29 , a humanist chaplain at @entity30 , delivered their own 10 " non-commandments " in a book they co-wrote : " @entity33 , @entity34			1
" @entity26 said the book forced him to clarify and articulate his own beliefs , and he thought others could benefit from doing the same			2
" a lot of atheists ' books are about whether to believe in @entity4 or not , " he said			1
" we wanted to consider : ok , so you do n't believe in @entity4 , what 's next ? and that 's actually a much harder question			1
" enter the " @entity46 , " in which atheists were asked to offer modern alternatives to the famous @entity3			2
and , to sweeten the pot , the contest offered $ 10,000 in moolah to the winning would - be @entity1			1
( if it helped boost atheists ' public image and drum up publicity for his book , all the better , @entity26 said			2
) the contest drew more than 2,800 submissions from 18 countries and 27 @entity62 states , according to @entity63 and @entity29			2
the proposed " non-commandments " ranged from the quizzical ( " do n't follow your nature " ) to the quixotic ( " thriving in space is the ultimate goal " )			2
a team of 13 judges selected 10 of the more sober and serious submissions , and announced the winners friday			1
there 's nary a " thou shalt " among them -- nothing specifically about murder , stealing or adultery , although there is a version of the @entity81 , which presumably would cover those crimes			0
if they lack faith in the divine , the atheist " non-commandments " display a robust faith in humankind , as if @entity88 had replaced @entity2			1
@entity26 said humans are hardwired for compassion , and the scientific method and wisdom of crowds -- or the tribes that gather online each day -- will weed out bad ideas			0
in other words , this is an open - ended , and hopefully progressive , process , he said			0
so , will the 10 ideas form a new moral foundation for atheists or build a @entity102 ? take a look and see what you think			1
here are the " ten non-commandments " chosen as the winners : 1			1
be open - minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence			0
strive to understand what is most likely to be true , not to believe what you wish to be true			0
the scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world			0
every person has the right to control of their body			0
@entity4 is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life			1
be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them			0
treat others as you would want them to treat you , and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated			0
we have the responsibility to consider others , including future generations			0
there is no one right way to live			0
leave the world a better place than you found it .			0
