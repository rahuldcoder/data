-- can you imagine playing a single video game for 10 years ? one man did			1
and it helped him imagine something else : a bleak , war - ravaged future version of @entity7			1
a member of the social news website @entity9 who goes by the name @entity11 posted his results from a decade - long game of " @entity14 , " a turn - based strategy games in which players build their own society			1
his epic struggle pushed the game to its limits , further than developers ever imagined or planned for			1
the " civilization " franchise is a series of strategy games that allow players to grow small tribes into large , sprawling nations			2
players can manage resources , build armies and engage in diplomacy in an effort to grow their civilization into a world leader			2
" @entity14 " was released in 1996			1
but when the third version of the game was released in 2001 , @entity11 said , he was already deep into his current game and wanted to see how far he could go			1
he does n't play every day but returns to what he called a " hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation " when he has some free time			1
now in the year 3991 , his world is down to three super-nations , each competing for dwindling resources , and a planet left scarred by multiple nuclear wars			1
his celts are locked in a 1,700 - year war with the @entity52 and the @entity53			1
all other nations have been destroyed or absorbed			2
" peace seems to be impossible			0
every time a cease fire is signed , the @entity52 will surprise attack me or the @entity53 the very next turn , often with nuclear weapons , " @entity11 wrote on @entity9			1
" even when the @entity59 forces a peace treaty			0
so i can only assume that peace will come only when they 're wiped out			0
it is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum			0
" because of the continual fighting , he was forced to abandon his democracy and adopt a communist state , because his @entity69 kept overruling him when he wanted to declare war			0
also , his cities are filled with starving people ( 90 % of his world 's population died from nuclear annihilation or famine from global warming ) because , he says , he has to keep building war machines to sustain his combat efforts			1
" so you want a granary so you can eat ? sorry ; i have to build another tank instead			0
maybe next time , " he wrote			0
constant nuclear bombardment and sabotage have melted the world 's ice caps over and over again , resulting in the flooding of all terrain other than mountains			2
he said his world is full of swamp ( which is useless for farming ) and irradiated lands			0
" civilization " franchise creator @entity94 said developers never even thought about someone taking a " @entity98 " game this far into the future			2
" there 's no way we could have tested for this , so it was a surprise to us , " @entity94 said			0
" i ca n't say that we ever thought anyone would play a game of ' @entity98 ' for that long			2
it 's exciting that a fan of the series would dedicate 10 years to playing one continuous game			1
" before you think @entity11 is just an unfeeling ruler , he said he does want to find a way to end the longstanding war			1
" my goal for the next few years is to try and end the war and thus use the engineers to clear swamps and fallout so that farming may resume			0
i want to rebuild the world			0
but i 'm not sure how			0
" reddit users have been filling up his post with suggestions on how to make his world livable again			2
and a new thread has developed , called @entity127 , where players are chatting about their own experiences			0
@entity94 has a new challenge for @entity11			2
" we should probably send him a copy of ' @entity133 ' and ' @entity133 : @entity134			0
' maybe in 10 years , he can create a similar scenario			0
we applaud you for playing what 's sure to be the longest - running game of ' @entity98 ' ever			1
