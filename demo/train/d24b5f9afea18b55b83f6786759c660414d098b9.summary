-- @entity1 is the kind of place you 'd expect to find in one of @entity7 's comic novels -- a playground for @entity10 's eccentric and carefree landed gentry			1
nestled among 600 acres of lush farmland and landscaped gardens , the 36 - room house was built 300 years ago by architect sir @entity14 for one of the country 's aristocratic families			2
not only is the property one of the finest examples of @entity22 buildings , it 's unusual in that it has remained a private dwelling			1
indeed , the owner of this estate is no ordinary @entity27			1
born @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 is one of a number of @entity33 - born tycoons acquiring some of the @entity35 's most iconic buildings from old families crippled by their exorbitant running costs			1
@entity30 is coy about how much he paid for @entity1 , but @entity35 publications have reported it sold for around $ 25 million in 2005 , as its founding family were struggling to keep up with its annual $ 3 million maintenance bill			1
and while the price - tag may seem eye - wateringly expensive , @entity30 spent almost twice as much redecorating the house			2
it was painstaking process , supervised by @entity47 , a relative of former @entity35 prime minister sir @entity48 and the late @entity49 , @entity50			2
the staff were streamlined but the " old timers " left are surprisingly loyal to their newfound country squire			0
'' what did i think of when a @entity33 tycoon bought this property ? '' muses the copiously tweeded chief groundsman @entity58 , a 30 - year veteran of @entity1			1
but i was happy because i knew a @entity33 tycoon would have money and that 's what this place needs			1
'' @entity30 is less optimistic about his neighbors			2
'' i suspect the locals had low expectations , '' he says in perfect , if soft - spoken @entity22			2
read more : @entity33 billionaire 's @entity69 - era art '' come to think of it they were probably expecting a shaven - headed man in a black leather overcoat with a bunch of goons toting @entity77			1
so , i think they were a bit disappointed when they saw me			0
'' a refugee from the @entity69 regime , who has lived in @entity84 since the 70s , @entity30 is actually something of an anti-oligarch			2
yes , his story is one from the rag trade to the rich list but it is unconventional in that his fortune was made outside of the fast - growing emerging markets			0
rather , it was in the hyper - competitive @entity84 retail sector where he is best known as the man behind the @entity99 label @entity30			2
@entity30 clearly does n't shy away from a challenge			2
when we meet he has just launched his high - end clothing line @entity30 in the @entity35 , during one of most pronounced double dip recessions in a generation			1
'' yes , @entity106 is in a recession but it 's like everything , things will change , '' he says			2
'' and in the meantime , it 's a wonderful place to live ... to work			0
'' in fact , @entity30 -- who spends only part of the year at @entity1 -- has become so enamored with " all things @entity22 " that he 's relocated part of his design studio to a former real tennis court in a wing designed by sir @entity120 , famous for the construction of @entity122 in @entity123			1
'' i also get inspired by the country life here , '' says @entity30 as he dons his signature white smock and weaves between seamstresses busy at their machines			1
photo gallery : @entity33 billionaire 's collection of @entity69 - era art " in fact , we 've recently launched a new line called @entity137 , which has everything a girl needs for a weekend in the country			1
besides , it 's a wonderful place for our fashion shoots			0
'' for his part , @entity30 appears to have perfected the country look '' thanks to my tailor on @entity148			1
'' when we meet he is looking effortlessly chic in a moss - green moleskin suit , which one ca n't help noticing matches much of the furniture			0
although @entity30 avoids questions about his true wealth and the value of his business , he does concede " it 's enough to keep me in good wine ... and country houses			1
'' it also seems enough to keep him in good company as well			0
for when we meet the house is abuzz with preparations for the weekend 's big event : a shooting party , which will attract the cream of @entity35 society			1
'' shooting days are easily 5000 calorie days , '' says @entity30 , who is trim for a man in his 50s			1
the day will include : a breakfast , of eggs , bacon , sausages , black pudding and bubble and squeak			0
then there 's elevenses with pork pie and spirits , followed by a black tie dinner , champagne , port stilton and more			2
'' speaking of which , @entity14 , '' he says as he catches his trusty manservant whizzing by			0
'' what are we thinking of in terms of the wine ? say a @entity191 1996 to go with the lamb ? '' a second later the butler scuttles back off down one of the house 's endless corridors and one is left with the feeling of having met the white rabbit from @entity201 's @entity200			0
'' he may be @entity35 but he 's spent a long time in @entity202 , '' says @entity30 affectionately			1
'' he used to work for the @entity203 , then he was @entity204 's butler			0
so , i think this probably the most normal set up he 's seen so far , '' he chortles			0
the @entity203 may be famous for their massive wealth and love of art but @entity1 itself would put many museums to shame			0
the interior has been so sympathetically redecorated it 's hard to believe at first that @entity30 bought the house after it had been stripped of its contents			1
'' unfortunately , the family i bought it from ( @entity218 ) had sold the contents at auction earlier , '' he says puffing on a @entity222 cigarette			0
one thing he did manage to get his hands on though , is a huge hunting scene attributed to sir @entity226 which hangs majestically above the fireplace in the drawing room flanked by similarly impressive works by @entity231 and @entity232			0
for all the riches in the world , @entity30 cuts a lonely -- if elegant -- figure in this former baronial hall			1
the twice - divorced father of one does n't even have a dog			0
" i 'd love one but i travel so much , '' he says			0
'' they always end up being the housekeeper 's dog			0
'' would he like to find a " @entity245 " one day ? '' let 's just say i 'm interviewing , '' @entity30 replies with a wry -- if not shy -- smile and another drag on his cigarette			1
as we leave , the parlor maid is laying out the silver in preparation for an @entity255 who is coming to tea while outside the gamekeeper ensures the drives are n't flooded before the shooting party arrives at the weekend			0
flocks of sheep graze in the distance while the odd pheasant flutters between the topiary			0
but then the bucolic scene is shattered by the arrival of a huge helicopter , and our host bids us goodbye .			0
