-- getting the details out of his head and on to paper was executive producer @entity6 's most important priority of the day			1
it was the first tuesday in march , and he had been up late the night before typing out the details of life in the " @entity10 , " an innovative new world in which police detectives relied on magic , not forensics , to catch criminals			1
writing the " show bible " was @entity6 's way of conveying his vision to his cast and crew			1
until a couple of months ago , these ideas existed only in his head			2
this one document would spell out every detail of life , from the way detectives picked apart a crime scene to the way they could make evidence float off the ground for closer forensic examination			0
the concept had already taken shape at @entity35 , where executives had teamed with @entity6 's @entity37 for content			1
it was then successfully pitched to @entity40 , where executives agreed to fund the pilot			0
after that , @entity6 's professional life became a frenzied ballet of scripting , casting , coordinating artwork and setting production schedules			1
he was now just a week away from a table read with the cast , and he already had a crew scouting shoot locations in and around @entity52			0
geeky interests linger the excitement was palpable			0
in a way , it reminded him of the feeling he had as a 5 - year - old boy sitting in his @entity61 , @entity62 , living room decades earlier			0
when @entity64 took his first uncharted steps on the moon , @entity6 watched with a sense of awe			1
for him , a whole new world was unfolding			0
" i wrote letters to @entity71 in first and second grade , and then i found ' @entity73 , ' " @entity6 recalls			1
" in third grade , i discovered ' @entity75 , ' and that was the defining show of my life			1
channel 26 , four o'clock every afternoon			0
" as @entity6 got older , he explored the jock route , playing football and running track in high school			1
he eventually became a self - described " baseball fanatic , " but that sense of discovery and exploration stayed with him and led to a writing job on " @entity75 : the @entity87			1
" a stint with " @entity75 : @entity97 " followed and helped launch his budding career as well as helping him earn status with a generation of nerds , even if he never really considered himself a part of that culture			1
" i 've never really thought of myself as a nerd , which is not to say others have n't thought it of me			2
i have referred to myself as a geek from time to time , and my wife sometimes calls me the ' @entity104 , ' although considering the hierarchical status of @entity106 , @entity107 , et al. , a mere prince might be more accurate			2
" like other television writers who eventually move up to become producers , executive producers and , sometimes show runners , @entity6 was building a body of work that was gaining attention			1
running the show eventually , it would be his executive producer role in the reimagined " @entity121 " series that would draw the most critical acclaim			1
it was also the first time @entity6 had been a co-creator on a show from beginning to end			1
he and executive producer @entity125 just seemed to click			0
" @entity127 is the scariest writer i know " his former producing partner recalls			0
" i 'm not sure there 's anything he ca n't do remarkably well			2
even within the context of ' @entity121 , ' there was such a wild panoply of styles and emotions -- action , tragedy , melodrama , comedy , philosophy , even music -- all of which i watched him nail			1
" " but he 's also weirdly unpretentious , " @entity125 said			2
" we 'd argue about whether something worked , but never whether or not it was ' good , ' because if you tell @entity127 something 's not good , he does n't take it personally			1
he just says ok and then does something great			0
" @entity6 's sense of flexibility and vision were solidifying his reputation among his cast and crew			1
writer and executive producer @entity157 first met @entity6 while pitching show ideas for " @entity75 : the @entity87 " as a grad student at @entity160			1
she later joined " @entity121 's " writing team			1
" there could be a million distractions around him -- he could be on a bad phone connection , in an airport , running for a plane , and he 'd immediately grasp a complex story as five of us shouted it into a speaker phone , and he 'd have the fix , " she said			0
@entity6 was acquiring a dedicated following with the show 's success			1
he understood how much the geek culture 's acceptance by the mainstream had helped his own success as genre material had made the transformation from niche to widespread commercial viability			1
" that 's good and bad , " @entity6 said			1
" more projects get made , more material is available , but a lot of it is dumbed down for the general audience , and the intimacy of fan - run conventions is now almost a thing of the past , " he said			0
" there was a time when being a genre geek meant you were part of a secret club , and when you wore your @entity204 ball cap ( from ' @entity204 ' ) or your @entity206 t - shirt ( ' 2001 ' ) , the other club members were the only ones who recognized the colors you were flying , and it was a way of connecting			1
now it 's all commercialized and merchandized and everyone 's a geek			1
guess that 's the price you pay for success			2
" with " @entity121 , " @entity6 had success in spades			1
he had led a team that was honored with a @entity218 , and @entity6 himself was nominated for an emmy for best writing in a dramatic series , followed by an @entity224 win for the " @entity121 " webisodes			1
the show had been a true test of courage and strength and had brought with it valuable lessons in how to run a show			0
" the show runners that i know are willing to charge into the barricades over and over again , and you have to be willing to get back up again , " @entity6 said			1
" you 're constantly fighting battles every day with executives , or directors or actors			0
you are constantly fighting , and you lose a fair number of battles , but the guys just keep going			0
" but even as he accepted critical praise for " @entity121 , " there was a line from another scene running through his head			1
it came from the movie " @entity261 , " in which the famous general described victorious @entity252 returning from battle in triumphant chariots : " a slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning : that all glory is fleeting			0
" the new journey by the end of march , @entity6 was wrapping up shooting for " @entity10			1
" he was guardedly optimistic			0
he had seen strong performances from the actors , had seen some beautiful effects come to life , and had even been a little surprised by how some of the characters had popped onscreen			0
he had been in the business long enough to know that what he had in his head would seldom compare to what was actually shot			0
still , he had a feeling this was going to be good			0
that morning , he watched a scene being edited in which the cops were using magic to dissect a crime scene			0
they set up a perimeter and effectively flipped a switch , setting off the magic that literally lifted blood from the ground so that they could see it from all angles			0
there was no doubt in his mind that this show was going to be something new and memorable			0
being an executive producer had its share of tough days and moments where there seemed to be a rush of decisions and nervous energy , but mostly , @entity6 found it to be calm and enjoyable			1
everything was still new , and he felt like he was falling in love every day			0
as he returned to @entity306 for final post-production work , a deadline loomed in his head			2
he had to have the show turned over to the executives at @entity40 by may 2			0
he 'd make it , but he knew that the weeks of waiting that would follow would be nerve - racking			0
the delivery may 2 came and went			0
the show was turned over , but @entity6 and his team probably would n't hear anything until the 16th			2
two full weeks of misery , wasted nervous energy , reading tea leaves and seemingly endless speculation with his agent			2
but bad news came early			0
on may 12 , the phone rang			0
@entity40 had decided to pass on " 17th @entity10 , " and with that , nine months of @entity6 's creative vision came to an end			1
" it was an ambitious project to take on , it was something different			2
i was just so close to it			0
it 's hard after shows like " battlestar " to not have equal measures of success after that			2
that 's a personal thing i have to keep in mind			2
" so @entity6 was literally at the beginning again , already plotting a new course and determined to make the experience worthwhile			2
" there are creative lessons i 'm trying to draw from , and there were some conceptual mistakes i probably made			0
but at the same time , you kind of balance that with the knowledge that each one of these projects is unique and they are all special			0
" as he sat down to go through his drawer of untapped ideas for what comes next , @entity6 remembered that famous line : all glory is fleeting			2
but as he 's proved , it 's also attainable .			2

watching the moon landing as a child *inspired* @entity6 's work on tv shows
he 's worked on " @entity75 : the @entity87 " and " @entity121 "
@entity6 identifies as a genre geek rather than a nerd
he recently *focused* his energy on a new project : the magical " @entity10 "
