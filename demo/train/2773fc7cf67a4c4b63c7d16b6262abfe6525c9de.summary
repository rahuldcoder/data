" what 's more important , food or satellites ? " this is n't a question our smiling @entity6 official was exactly prepared for			1
suddenly , he was n't smiling any more ; a moment so carefully choreographed was in unscripted territory			2
" please will you answer the question , " i persist			2
" is n't it more important to feed your people ? " the news briefing was over ; our official turned and was ushered out of the room			2
this had been the day the notoriously secretive country was pulling back the veil on its planned rocket launch they say will put a small satellite into orbit			1
defiant @entity6 displays rocket @entity6 insists this is a peaceful launch , the satellite for scientific research			1
the @entity31 and its allies are more dubious			1
to much of the world this country , still technically at war , is taking yet another step towards perfecting a long range missile that could strike @entity31 cities			1
" i 'm very disturbed by these claims , " the head of the launch site says			1
can you deny it is a missile ? i ask			2
" look for yourself , " he replies			0
" does it look like a missile to you ? this is why we invited you here			1
" true , @entity6 has taken an historic step			1
this is unprecedented access , bringing media from around the world to a highly sensitive site that had been hidden from view			0
as i step from our train , the launch pad and rocket are clearly visible nestled against a hill in the distance			1
up close , we get the grand tour			0
not only taken to the base of the rocket itself , but to the control center and the small satellite @entity6 maintains will be fired into orbit			1
this is not the first time this reclusive nation has carried out such tests			0
there was a failed launch in 2006 and another slightly more successful in 2009			2
still , analysts say along with its nuclear program , @entity76 has continued refining its missile technology			2
a successful launch this time , warn international observers , would show that @entity6 could deliver an object anywhere on the planet			1
after the death of the so - called @entity89 , @entity89 , last december there were brief flickers of hope his son and successor @entity92 , still under 30 , may begin to reform the country			0
@entity31 envoys sat down with @entity6 officials in @entity98 in february and promptly announced a new food aid deal			1
but this launch has scuttled any optimism			2
analysis : solving the @entity76 problem as we make the five hour train journey to the launch site at @entity107 , we get a rare glimpse through the window of a country long dubbed " the hermit kingdom			1
" it is a barren landscape			0
there is little sign of livestock , the odd cow , some goats , barely even a dog			0
in the distance figures can be seen chipping at the harsh ground in a land that does n't offer up enough to keep the people fed. it takes no imagination to grasp the impact of decades of suffering on these people			0
forged in war , they have endured devastating famine and the iron grip of now three generations of @entity92 family rule			0
this is what brings me to my original question			0
how can a country that has to go to the international community for food aid afford to spend so much on satellites , missiles or nukes ? i wo n't get the answer to that here today			0
but to understand is to look to the soul of the country and its hardline military			0
in @entity6 the army comes first			1
this regime 's legitimacy does n't rest on feeding people , its survival rests on an aura of invincibility ; convincing its people it can repel any invader			0
@entity92 's fate rests on the power of his arsenal , and like his father and grandfather before him , no price is too high .			0
