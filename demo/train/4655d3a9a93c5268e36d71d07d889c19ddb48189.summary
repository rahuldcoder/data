-- the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity1 has acquired two models of the world 's first 3d - printed gun			1
the ' @entity8 ' pistol is the invention of @entity10 , a @entity11 law student whose company @entity12 caused a furore in may when it made blueprints for its firearm freely available on the internet			1
the distribution of the designs led to @entity19 naming @entity10 as one of the ' @entity21 '			2
in theory , once downloaded , the designs would allow anyone with access to a 3d printer to make their own gun			2
video shows test firing of @entity31 printed handgun a few days after @entity10 conducted his first successful test of the pistol , the @entity33 government forced @entity12 to take the plans down			1
@entity10 complied , but not before the design had been downloaded over 100,000 times			2
the @entity2 museum has two copies of the @entity8 pistol on display as part of @entity44			0
the two prototypes on display -- one extant and one disassembled to show its components -- are part of a new collection of @entity31 objects			0
according to the curators , the guns " represent a turning point in debates around digital manufacturing			0
" the @entity59 in @entity3 also has a liberator on display			2
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity10 said that he felt the museum 's curators appreciated the @entity8 pistol as a design object , but also appreciated the political ideas the weapon conveyed			1
" the curators of the museum 's digital collection understand @entity8 and our other pieces are first and foremost articles of political thought - practice , " @entity10 said			1
@entity10 says that in his view 3d printing is still in its infancy , and that it will become more significant in the future : " i see digital manufacturing playing a bigger role in our lives			2
" while he thought that the mainstream firearms industry is no longer as powerful as it once was , @entity10 said he thought that the spread of weaponry will gradually increase , and that in future it will be easy for almost anyone to get a gun : " i think gun - making culture is on an understandable decline , but the barrier to entry to this culture will be lowered			1
" @entity33 requires group to remove @entity31 gun instructions from its website considering it as a design object , @entity10 believes that the @entity8 's unusual shape has been part of its success : " looking back , i would change nothing of the design			1
it was curious , boxy , alien			0
its strangeness allowed it a better examination -- both as an article of design and as a concept			0
" alongside the @entity31 printed gun , the museum also acquired four other items which point to the future of design , including a homemade toaster constructed from odds and ends for just $ 6 and a futuristic armchair with elongated " ears " to create an artificial private space			1
@entity31 printed guns a boon for criminals ? all the items were bought through the @entity126 to benefit the @entity2			0
@entity127 , the museum 's director , said : " the generosity of supporters of the @entity126 ensures that the @entity2 is able to acquire for our permanent collections some of the best and most exciting design projects of our time			0
" this year 's acquisitions reflect an interesting combination of new technologies working with traditional crafts			0
