ever wanted to see who would win in a fight between @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity5 's @entity4 ? now you can in @entity6 , a cartoon fighting game for the @entity7			1
' brawl ' lets you pick your favorite video game character and spar against your best friend over the internet			1
as with the previous games in this popular series - 1999 's @entity16 on the @entity17 and 2001 's @entity18 on the @entity19 - this new @entity7 brawler lets you duke it out with and against popular @entity3 mascots such as @entity2 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , each with their own unique moves , abilities and special power attacks			1
but the latest version - which sold more than 1.4 million units in the @entity34 in the first week after its launch march 9 - also lets you fight against characters from other popular video games including @entity38 from @entity40 's @entity39 and @entity4 from @entity5 's @entity4 , as well as other @entity3 favorites such as @entity42 ( from @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( from @entity45 ) , @entity46 ( from @entity47 ) and @entity48 ( from the @entity50 games )			1
having all of these familiar and beloved characters in one game is a treat , not to mention it 's fun to unlock all the fighters by winning matches - as not everyone is available right from the get - go			2
depending on the mode you select , the game plays out as follows : you and a friend can select which character you 'd like to play as and then pick a desired venue from the nearly two dozen choices			2
it 's a last man - or beast - standing scenario , as you will fight , jump and block until one character falls off the edge of the screen			1
at the end of the round a winner is declared			0
that 's the gist of it , but the many moves you can execute per character keeps things fun and frantic - and with lots of colorful eye candy , too			0
special moves include @entity83 's @entity82 ( where the little green dinosaur can shoot fireballs ) , @entity26 's nasty @entity86 ( which releases deadly fumes out of his buttocks ) and @entity46 's @entity6 ( where the monkey takes flight and shoots peanuts out of dual wooden pistols )			0
also new to the series is online play , so you can play against friends on another @entity7 in another city			2
it works surprisingly well , especially considering the somewhat choppy internet connectivity in @entity100			0
plus , there 's a lengthy story - driven adventure mode called " the @entity104 , " which is essentially a full game			0
@entity6 is also fully customizable , allowing you to tweak everything from the character 's special powers , weapons and moves to the musical score to how the game is controlled ( whether you prefer @entity114 , @entity114 and @entity115 , classic controller or the gamecube controller )			2
this eagerly anticipated @entity7 game is great fun for those new to the franchise or long - standing followers			1
its pick - up - and - play accessibility also makes it perfect for players of all ages - that is , if you do n't mind the cartoon violence and somewhat crude humor , such as @entity26 passing gas			0
in a word , @entity6 is a blast			0

@entity136 is a last - man - standing style fight game
user can choose favorite @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity40 characters
internet game play much better than previous @entity7 games
users are able to set weapons , powers and controls
