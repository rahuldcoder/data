in an 85 - page report , the rights groups said those gaps include " reimbursing workers for recruiting fees , which often take months or years to repay and are the single greatest factor in creating conditions of forced labor			1
" the report also found " lapses in effectively punishing abusive contractors and following through on promises to make monitoring reports public			1
" @entity5 , a $ 22 billion cultural project , will include local branches of @entity23 , as well as the @entity24 and @entity25			0
" for too long , migrant workers in the @entity29 have toiled in abusive conditions , with private and public developers showing little concern , " said @entity26 , @entity27 director at @entity7			1
" now , finally , @entity29 developers and their international partners have stepped up to the plate on @entity5 to start to protect workers , but they will need to do more to curtail the abuses			0
" @entity7 first reported on the subject in 2009 , when they found widespread exploitation of laborers on @entity5			1
the rights group says there have been notable improvements since then , citing " commitments by leading educational and cultural bodies and @entity29 development companies to ensure regular payment of wages , rest breaks and days off , and employer - paid medical insurance , and to hire independent monitors to detect and report publicly on violations of workers ' rights on the island			2
" but today 's progress report noted that many workers still pay recruitment fees in order to obtain their jobs , adding that almost all the 47 workers interviewed reported paying between $ 900 and $ 3,350 to agents in their home countries , a practice that can trap them in debt			1
the report also found contractors are " regularly confiscating worker passports and substituting worker contracts with less favorable ones when the workers arrive in the @entity29			1
" in a response to @entity7 's report , @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , the island 's master developer , said they continue " to be deeply committed to safeguarding worker welfare on its projects "			2
in a statement @entity73 added that while the company is pleased to see @entity7 acknowledging the high standards they continue to uphold in the area of worker welfare , they also believe that " some of the findings detailed are outdated and inaccurate , as the report cites interviews conducted between october 2010 and january 2011			2
" the statement added : " moreover , the company believes the methodology @entity7 has used in the report is flawed ; we call into question the small sample of workers interviewed , as well as the limited number of contractors these workers represent			1
@entity73 therefore firmly believes that this report is not an accurate reflection of the current situation on @entity5			0
" with regard to recruitment fees , @entity73 said that they share @entity7 's concern , but that the fees continue to be a challenge			1
" this practice mainly occurs in the worker 's country of origin , " said @entity73 , " making it an extremely difficult problem to address from the @entity29			0
however , as according to @entity73 's employment practices policy , should any worker prove they have been charged fees by an agency to work on any of its projects , the company will take appropriate action under its agreement with the relevant contractor to reimburse the worker			0
by focusing solely on @entity5 , @entity7 is shifting the spotlight away from this important issue rather than trying to address it at its core			0
@entity73 therefore encourages @entity7 to take the lead role in campaigning against this damaging practice on a wider scale and will fully support it in doing so			0
" a statement from @entity131 said that " @entity7 's latest report acknowledges the major steps that we and our government partners have taken to ensure the health and welfare of the individuals who are building @entity131 's new campus on @entity5			2
" @entity140 , assistant vice chancellor , public affairs and community relations for @entity131 , added : " we also welcome any new , actionable information that will enable us to accomplish our goals on this front			0
however , whereas our third - party compliance auditors conduct worker interviews each and every month , it appears that @entity7 's latest report relies on interviews that took place between 14 and 17 months ago			2
in a number of cases , the report also fails to indicate which project an individual was working on , which makes researching and / or addressing specific claims virtually impossible			0

@entity7 says more needs to be done to improve working conditions
