-- when i asked @entity0 's readers and viewers to pick the five social - justice topics i 'll cover for the rest of the year , i never expected so many of you to select the one with the @entity8 title : " widest rich - poor gap			1
" i figured most of the country , or the world , would be sick of reading about the recession and bankers and bailouts			2
as a person with a job , it would be easy for me to say that 's a 2008 story			1
but that 's why i trust the wisdom of the crowd : you tell me when i 'm wrong			1
@entity25 's widening gap between the rich and poor -- and this country 's fast - disappearing sense of security and progress and economic stability -- is so far the top pick among the 20 subjects i presented as part of a new project called @entity35			1
that tells me that for many of you , it is the most pressing justice issue of our time			2
i would n't have seen that on my own , and i 'm glad you did			0
you encouraged me to look deeper into the issue , and i 'm excited that we might be delving into this story together			0
the vote is part of a new @entity0 opinion project that focuses on bringing attention to overlooked places and issues			1
i 'm asking you to pick stories you find most compelling or important from a list of 20 -- and i 'll report on the five winners			1
voting closes at 2:00 p.m. et on monday , so there is still plenty of time for you to influence the outcome			1
here are the top five issues as of noon on wednesday : 1			0
@entity63 - poor gap 2			0
where rape is common 3			0
conflict is never - ending 5			0
@entity25 's most endangered river about 23,000 ballots have been submitted so far , and only 916 votes separate the topics in fourth and seventh places , as of this writing			1
( while this story was being completed , " illegal animal trade " jumped into fifth place , for instance )			1
when i noticed rich - poor gap was such a crowd favorite , i was a little disappointed , to be honest			0
how could i stop an economy story from being dull and gray ? but last night i started doing some research and started to see what many of you had already noticed : that this is a broadly important and interesting topic -- an underreported story , despite the never - ending flood of financial news headlines			1
( friends at sites like @entity91 and @entity93 's @entity92 have been doing a stellar job of covering the crisis ; but does anyone want to read another jobs - report story ? and just forget about the @entity98			2
) beneath all the spreadsheets and wonkery , this seems to be a story about fairness and people			0
is it one about rich folks who caused the recession and got off clean ? about poor folks bearing the brunt of the recession ? about a return to free market ideals ? they 're fascinating issues , and i 'm undecided on them at this point			0
last night , i watched the documentary " @entity127 , " which focuses on the street in @entity118 that 's home to a building it says has more billionaires than any other -- and also a section of the @entity124 with a high rate of infant mortality			2
the stats presented in the documentary are staggering : 1 in 7 @entity25 is on food stamps ; a college degree is needed to compete , but the cost of college has soared since the 1980s ; 400 of the richest people in the @entity25 control as much wealth as the bottom 50 % of @entity25			0
i 'm glad it 's a topic you highlighted for me			2
@entity0 should continue to cover the war in @entity139 , whether or not you would vote for that			1
same goes for this @entity144 madness			0
but with @entity35 , i 'm trusting you to choose			0
you deserve to have a say in what i cover -- and in what @entity0 covers			2
not because this is a popularity contest , but because i firmly believe that stories are more meaningful for people when they 're part of them			1
no one wants be on the wrong end of a bullhorn			0
i 'm excited to explore these topics -- any of these topics -- together			2
that 's journalism in the public interest			2
think about which stories are most important , which could have the most impact and which you 're willing to be a part of			1
encourage others to do the same			0
and if you 've got a few extra econ books sitting around , send ' em my way			0
the views expressed in this column are solely those of @entity173 .			1
