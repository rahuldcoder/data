-- it began with high hopes and lofty rhetoric , as a newly reelected president @entity4 ended his @entity6 wish list with a call to action : " it remains the task of us all , as citizens of these @entity11 , to be the authors of the next great chapter in our @entity11 story			1
" but 2013 will hardly be remembered as a great chapter			1
instead , even with wednesday 's debt ceiling and government funding deal , this is a wasted year in @entity19 , one of more band - aid budgeting , polarized partisanship and @entity24 chaos			1
yes , public opinion polls suggest the government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis is more damaging to @entity24 than to the president and his fellow @entity29			2
and @entity4 gives up little in the deal struck wednesday to fund the government through january and raise the debt ceiling through early february			2
but with precious time in his second term ticking by , it is safe to say the president is losing even as he may " win " the short - term political blame game			1
in defeat , @entity37 may live to fight another day consider the priorities laid out in his february @entity6 : * a new jobs plan * infrastructure investments targeting roads and the 70,000 @entity11 bridges he noted are deemed structurally unsound * an increase , to $ 9 an hour , in the federal minimum wage * a guarantee of quality pre-school education for every child in @entity11 * new background checks for gun purchases and , the president asked , for an up or down vote on new gun restrictions , including a ban on certain assault style weapons * plus sweeping immigration reform , including , in his words , " a reasonable pathway to earned citizenship			0
" also in his address : a plea to end the budgeting by brinksmanship and crisis and a hopeful call for bipartisan negotiations on tax reform and @entity71 and other entitlement spending			0
eight months later -- as the end of that critical first year of the presidential term comes into focus -- none of those priorities has been realized			0
nine things we missed during the shutdown and @entity19 's dysfunction appears to be only deepening , as differences between @entity29 and @entity24 are often overshadowed by the internal civil war within the @entity24			1
do n't count on that environment improving once @entity19 stumbles its way past this latest crisis			2
the deal provides a temporary fix - essentially kicking the can down the road to january and february to give @entity91 and the @entity92 time to negotiate			0
a welcome respite , perhaps , but the issues wo n't get any easier over the course of those three or four months , and the politics - believe it or not - could get even more difficult because those new deadlines are early in the midterm election year			0
@entity24 shutdown pain may boost @entity29 in 2014			0

with high hopes after reelection , president @entity4 sounded call to action
but 2013 has been hardly great for the president 's *legislative* agenda
safe to say @entity4 losing even if he may " win " short - term political blame game on budget
@entity19 's dysfunction appears to be only deepening
