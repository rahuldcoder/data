as the @entity2 gets ready to blame the @entity4 hack on @entity5 , a troublesome question is emerging : just what is @entity5 capable of ? experts say the nation has spent scarce resources on building up a unit called " @entity12 " to carry out cyberattacks			1
@entity5 has been blamed in the past for attacks in @entity15 , but the @entity4 hack -- if indeed @entity5 is behind it -- would seem to represent an escalation of tactics			1
" i think we underestimated @entity5 's cybercapabilities , " said @entity19 , director of @entity20 at @entity21			1
" they certainly did n't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks			0
" @entity19 was referring to attacks on @entity15 broadcasters and banks last year			0
in march 2013 , @entity15 police said they were investigating a widespread computer outage that struck systems at leading television broadcasters and banks , prompting the military to step up its cyberalert level			0
the @entity15 communications regulator reportedly linked the computer failures to hacking that used malicious code , or malware			0
an investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by the @entity5 previously , said @entity49 , an official at the @entity50			2
a spokesman for the general staff of the @entity54 labeled the allegations " groundless " and " a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the @entity59 to an extreme phase , " according to @entity56 , the @entity5 state news agency			2
@entity5 has similarly denied the massive hack of @entity62 , which has been forced to cancel next week 's planned release of " @entity64 , " a comedy about an assassination attempt on @entity5 leader @entity67			1
but @entity56 applauded the attack			0
" the hacking into the @entity62 might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the @entity5 , " it said , using the acronym of its official name , the @entity5			2
" the hacking is so fatal that all the systems of the company have been paralyzed , causing the overall suspension of the work and supposedly a huge ensuing loss			0
" experts point to several signs of @entity5 involvement			2
they say there are similarities between the malware used in the @entity4 hack and previous attacks against @entity15			1
both were written in @entity15 , an unusual language in the world of cybercrime			0
" unfortunately , it 's a big win for @entity5			1
they were able to get @entity4 to shut down the picture			0
they got the @entity2 government to admit that @entity5 was the source of this and there 's no action plan really , at least publicly no action plan , in response to it , " said @entity19			1
" i think from their perspective , in @entity108 , they 're probably popping the champagne corks			1
" @entity0 's @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 is set to blame @entity5 for the massive hack at @entity4
it 's not the first time @entity5 would be *accused* of launching such an attack
" in @entity108 , they 're probably popping the champagne corks , " says one *analyst*
