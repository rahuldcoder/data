to kick off our coverage of young adult literature in october , we asked members of the @entity6 newsroom to share books that changed our lives			1
it was n't the ultimate list for everyone -- we left the definition of " life - changing " up to individuals , and yes , @entity9 came up more than once			2
but we also asked readers to share their top picks in the comments			1
again , we left " life - changing " open to interpretation			0
we loved the responses and reasons for your choices , from @entity24 's " @entity23 " to @entity25 's " @entity26			0
so , we complied them and created another list -- the books you read as young people that changed your lives			2
click through the gallery to see what readers came up with , and tell us about books you read as a child that influenced you .			0
