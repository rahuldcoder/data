while senior @entity2 officials say they are now less worried about @entity4 prime minister @entity3 launching a coup to stay in power , they still predict he 'll try to obstruct the political process to keep his designated successor , @entity8 , out of office			1
one senior @entity2 official compared @entity3 to former president @entity11 -- a paranoid leader who grew more mercurial as his political fortunes collapsed			0
@entity3 has vowed to fight @entity8 's nomination			1
@entity3 could bide his time and try to divide @entity4 politicians to make it difficult for @entity8 to muster enough support to form a government over the next 30 days as @entity4 's constitution outlines			1
but the officials say they do n't think he has enough backing to do that			0
a large portion of the @entity24 bloc , including most of his own party , is behind @entity8 , and that gives the @entity2 some confidence a government can be formed within the prescribed time frame			1
@entity4 's political power struggle reached a breaking point on monday when president @entity33 named @entity8 , the deputy speaker of @entity34 , to replace @entity3			1
president @entity35 publicly endorsed @entity8 , calling his nomination a " promising step forward			0
" both @entity35 and vice president @entity38 called him to express their support			0
as a further incentive to quickly form a new government , the @entity35 administration is promising additional financial and military support in its fight in northern @entity4 against the @entity46 , militants formerly known as @entity48			1
airstrikes and airdrops secretary of state @entity51 said in @entity52 on tuesday the @entity2 " stands ready to fully support a new inclusive @entity4 government			1
" despite frustrations with @entity3 's leadership , the @entity2 has increased military aid to his government over the past year to combat militants			2
that assistance has been stepped up over the past two months as @entity48 forces claimed large areas of territory in northern @entity4 in a brutal campaign			0
just last week , @entity35 ordered airstrikes against militant positions and humanitarian airdrops to aid thousands of the @entity68 minority under threat from the extremist group and trapped in the @entity71			0
on tuesday , he decided to send more than 100 additional military advisers to that region in a move the @entity2 said was necessary to look at additional humanitarian relief options			0
@entity76 has sought to separate the need for urgent support to combat militants from support for @entity3			0
the administration is also helping covertly arm @entity84 @entity83 forces battling @entity48			0
more help possible @entity51 said the @entity2 was " prepared to consider additional political , economic and security options as @entity4 starts to build a new government " noting that the aid was " very much calculated to try to stabilize the security situation , expand economic development and strengthen the democratic institutions			1
" the @entity2 has been encouraged by unprecedented cooperation between the @entity4 military and @entity84 forces in fighting @entity48 and helping the civilians in the north			2
officials said it gives them hope that @entity4 's long - divided ethnic groups are finally uniting in the wake of the @entity46 threat			1
but with its military support , @entity76 also risks fueling @entity4 's sectarian divide			2
between additional backing for a new @entity4 shia - led government and its direct support for the @entity84 , the @entity2 risks pushing @entity4 's @entity109 population toward the @entity46 , which is also @entity109 , because they will see that support as taking sides in what is widely viewed as a civil war			1
and with @entity109 already disenfranchised from the @entity24 - led government , @entity2 airstrikes are only likely to exacerbate those political differences			2
@entity118 is a @entity24 , from the same party as @entity3 , serving at one time as his aide			0
but can he unite the country and fight off the sweeping islamic state advance ? " @entity8 has never been involved in personal controversy , he is someone who really has tried to tow a straight line , " said @entity123 , editor of the newsletter inside @entity4 politics			1
" i think he is someone who will try to be inclusive and work with people			0
but at same time he 's never been someone to push for reform			0
" showing political skills while @entity8 may not be viewed as a transformational figure , the @entity2 has been impressed with the way he stood up to @entity3 politically and accumulated support of many @entity24			2
" sometimes what is needed is a good bureaucrat who can get things back on track , " one senior @entity135 official said			0
" we do n't need anymore personalities			0
" what happens , however , if @entity3 is able to keep @entity8 from forming a government ? @entity4 politicans would be back to @entity145 and the @entity2 would be forced to choose between supporting @entity3 's caretaker government , despite its stated reservations about him , or waiting until a new prime minister is designated who can form a government			1
if @entity48 continues to advance , however , neither the @entity4 nor the @entity2 will have the luxury of time			2
will @entity4 's @entity3 go without a fight ? 5 things to know @entity4 prime minister @entity3 objects as his ouster looms what to know about @entity4 's prime minister			1
