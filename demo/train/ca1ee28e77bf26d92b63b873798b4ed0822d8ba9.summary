@entity0 -- boys may soon be able to get @entity3 , the vaccine given to girls and young women to prevent infection by four types of human papillomavirus			2
@entity3 , a vaccine against human papillomavirus , would be given to boys exactly as it is to girls			0
a @entity13 advisory committee voted wednesday to recommend that the vaccine be made available to boys and young men aged 9 to 26 for protection against genital warts caused by @entity19			1
the vaccine protects against four types of @entity19 , and two of those are believed to be responsible for 70 percent of cervical and anal cancers , and @entity19 - associated penile and throat - and - neck cancers			1
the other two cause 90 percent of genital warts cases , researchers say			1
at wednesday 's advisory committee meeting , pharmaceutical giant @entity29 , maker of @entity3 , presented data from three clinical trials that the company claims supports broadening the distribution of the vaccine to include males			1
the trials included more than 5,400 boys and men from six continents and 23 countries			0
according to @entity47 , an independent scientist at @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , and the trials ' principal investigator , " the data clearly demonstrates that there was a benefit to men in receiving @entity3			0
overall , we saw a 90 percent reduction in disease -- genital warts and pre-cancerous lesions -- caused by @entity19 in men and an 89 percent reduction in genital warts incidence			1
" essentially , we have a really fantastic opportunity to extend the benefit of the vaccine to men , " @entity62 said			2
" this is a sexually transmitted infection ; if we can reduce infection and related diseases in men , we have the potential to have a much broader public health impact by reducing the overall burden of infection and disease in the community at large			0
" @entity62 said there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine			0
there were some minor side effects such as pain at the injection site and low - grade fever			0
the vaccine would be administered in boys and young men exactly as it 's been given to girls and young women : three doses over a period of six months			2
@entity29 spokeswoman @entity92 said the cost will be $ 130 per dose			0
according to the @entity96 , about 20 million @entity95 are infected with @entity19			1
there are 6.2 million new infections each year			0
the @entity96 says that at least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get an hpv infection at some time in their life			1
the @entity104 says @entity19 is the most common sexually transmitted virus and puts that number at 75 percent or more			1
the @entity96 says that although @entity19 is very common in both sexes , most men wo n't develop symptoms or serious health problems , and there is no test to detect the virus in men			1
the only approved hpv test on the market is for women , for use in cervical - cancer screening			0
the advisory committee also voted that @entity120 , a new hpv vaccine made by @entity121 , appeared to be safe and effective for girls and young women 10 to 25 years of age			1
@entity120 has been approved in @entity125			0
" this is an important step in cancer prevention for the millions of girls and young women at risk for cervical cancer , " said @entity126 , vice president and director of @entity130 vaccine development for @entity121			2
" if approved , @entity120 will provide protection against cervical cancer , a devastating disease that is responsible for thousands of deaths in @entity95 women each year			2
" still , the panel recommended that @entity121 do more studies that would monitor miscarriages and other problems reported by patients			2
in a final review , both applications will be considered by the @entity13 , which usually -- but not always -- follows the recommendations of its advisory committees .			0

@entity151 says shots could prevent genital warts in males 9 to 26
vaccine 's maker claims studies show 90 percent less hpv - caused disease
@entity19 common in both sexes , @entity96 says , but men develop fewer problems
@entity151 also *favors* @entity120 , new vaccine from @entity121
