feeling buried by work , like you ca n't find time for a few days off , like your entire work - life balance is out of whack ? if you 're an @entity7 worker , it just might be			1
a new study has found that @entity7 workers forfeited $ 52.4 billion in time - off benefits in 2013 and took less vacation time than at any point in the past four decades			1
@entity7 workers turned their backs on a total of 169 million days of paid time off , in effect " providing free labor for their employers , at an average of $ 504 per employee , " according to the study			1
titled " all work and no pay : the @entity32 , " the study was conducted by @entity27 for the @entity29 's @entity28 , which studies the impact of forgone vacation time			1
" @entity7 are work martyrs , " says the @entity29			1
" tied to the office , they leave more and more paid time off unused each year , forfeiting their earned benefits and , in essence , work for free			1
" according to the study , in 2013 @entity7 employees took an average of 16 days of vacation , compared with an average of 20.3 days as recently as 2000			1
" the economic potential of returning to the pre- 2000 vacation patterns is massive : annual vacation days taken by @entity7 employees would jump 27 % ( or 768 million days ) , delivering a $ 284 billion impact across the entire @entity7 economy , " according to the travel association			1
based in @entity49 , the association is a national nonprofit organization representing all components of the travel industry			0
does this describe you ? productivity and stress management trainer and coach @entity54 says the issue is driven by a number of factors			0
" one , workers are afraid to take their vacations in the layoff era , " @entity54 said			2
" it might mark them as less ' committed ' than coworkers			0
" it 's called defensive overworking			0
they work long hours and skip vacations to insulate themselves from cutbacks			2
" according to @entity71 , president and ceo of the @entity29 , 28 % of workers surveyed said they 've declined to take earned days off in order to illustrate their dedication to the job			1
" they say , ' i do n't want to be seen as a slacker , ' " @entity71 said			0
" ' i want to be seen as someone who is really dedicated			0
' " but it does them no good whatsoever			0
people who take more time off tend to get more raises and promotions			1
" " it 's futile , " @entity54 agreed			0
" people who do n't take their vacations get laid off just like everyone else			2
" work force cutbacks and " device addiction " are other factors			2
" lean staffing , with more and more people doing the jobs of several people , makes it hard to escape , " @entity54 said			2
" they 're not taking vacations because they have too much work			0
" " about 40 % ( of workers surveyed ) say they 're afraid of all the work they 're going to get to when they get back from vacation , " @entity71 said			1
" work pileup scares the hell out of them			0
" " another big reason people are n't taking their time is that they are caught up in ' busyness ' and device addiction , " @entity54 said			2
" finally , many people are so caught up in the performance identity , worth based on what they get done , they feel guilty when they step back			0
" reversing the trend ? a number of studies show that fewer vacation days can , perhaps counterintuitively , lead to decreased productivity			1
researcher @entity126 of @entity127 has found that the respite effect of a vacation can increase performance by 80 %			0
reaction times of returning vacationers increased 40 % in his study			0
according to @entity136 , some @entity7 companies , particularly on the @entity135 , are beginning to overhaul their vacation policies			1
" we 're seeing multiple companies -- @entity140 and @entity141 and others -- that are doing away with their vacation policies entirely , " @entity71 said			0
" they 've just said , ' we no longer have a vacation policy ; please discuss with your boss and take the time off you need			2
' " in addition , companies that have instituted " use it or lose it " policies -- which do n't allow annual vacation time to be rolled over to the next year or accrued for later use -- find that more employees take all of their earned leave			2
@entity136 reports that some companies and organizations , including the @entity29 , have begun giving bonuses to employees who use their entire allotment of paid leave			0
perhaps these companies have become convinced by a growing body of research supporting the long - term bottom - line benefits of time away from work			1
author of the books " work to live " and " @entity168 , " @entity54 is also the author of a current @entity170 story titled " @entity171 to increased productivity : taking @entity174 , " in which he states that " working without letup is a bad habit that can jeopardize business , health and the life you 're supposedly working toward			0
" have you forfeited earned time off ? are you satisfied with the time you get away from work ? share your work experiences in the comments ?			1
