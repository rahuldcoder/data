@entity0 -- @entity2 is prepared to gradually reduce the amount of oil it imports from @entity6 , finance minister @entity7 said thursday , as the @entity8 seeks to muster international support to put fresh pressure on @entity11 over its nuclear program			1
@entity2 imports 10 % of its crude oil from @entity6 at the moment , @entity7 said at a news briefing after meeting with @entity8 treasury secretary @entity16			1
the country is ready to decrease that level " in a planned manner , " he said			1
" what i told the secretary is that we have already reduced @entity6 oil imports by 40 % in the past five years , " @entity7 said , standing next to @entity16			1
" the nuclear development issue is an issue that the international community can not overlook , so we very much understand the @entity8 action			0

" we are working very closely with @entity40 and @entity2 and countries around the world to substantially increase the pressure we bring on @entity6 , " @entity16 said			1

" i think ' small victory ' is a fair categorization , " said @entity52 , a @entity54 ' expert on energy policy and national security			0
from january to september 2011 , @entity6 exported 13 % of its crude oil to @entity2 , according to the @entity60			1
@entity52 said @entity6 is likely to absorb this and find alternatives -- unless those drop out as well			0
" as long as @entity6 has a substantial set of potential buyers , it 's going to make as much money as it made before , " @entity52 said			0
@entity52 said @entity2 wants to phase out its imports from @entity6 slowly so it can smoothly transition to other sources			2
" that same slow speed gives @entity6 the opportunity to transition to other customers , " he said			0
@entity16 had made a similar push for @entity46 to reduce its @entity6 oil imports			2

@entity6 threatened in late december to block the @entity109 if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports			1
@entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 have all proposed such sanctions to punish @entity6 for lack of cooperation on its nuclear program			0
