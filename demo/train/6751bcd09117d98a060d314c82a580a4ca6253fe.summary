-- the allegations grabbed headlines across @entity3 and around the globe : hooded gunmen stormed into a beach bungalow and attacked a group of @entity10 tourists , authorities said , raping six women and tying up a group of men with cell phone cables and bikini straps			1
the high - profile case in the @entity3 resort city of @entity18 this week was a sharp reminder of significant security problems in a state that has seen violence surge even as homicide numbers in other hotspots across the country have started to dip			1
@entity3 drug - related violence : how it all started and it drew renewed attention to topics that @entity3 president @entity31 has steered out of the spotlight since he took office in december			1
as authorities investigate the alleged crime , experts say the incident shows that even as @entity3 's new government tries to paint a brighter picture and revamp the country 's image , realities on the ground remain complicated -- and , in some areas , ugly			1
follow the latest news in @entity10 at @entity46 a state plagued by warring gangs for years @entity50 state , where @entity18 sits , has ranked among the @entity3 states with the highest homicide rates , a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation			1
last year @entity50 had more reported gun murders than any other state in @entity3 , more than 1,600 , according to a federal government tally released last month			1
" while places like @entity67 have become safer , other places in the country have seen violence spike up , " said @entity61 , an associate at the @entity63 - based @entity62			1
" @entity18 is one of the areas , and in fact , the entire state of @entity50 is one of the places , where there 's been more violence recently			1
" local authorities said tuesday that the alleged rape was n't tied to organized crime but then revealed wednesday that they believe the victims bought drugs from one or more of the suspects in the days before the alleged attack			1
even if a major criminal organization like @entity86 " @entity89 's notorious @entity88 cartel was n't behind the alleged attack , it 's part of a deep - seated security problem in the region , said @entity92 , a security analyst at the @entity93 think tank			1
" it was n't @entity89 , " he said , " but i think it was one of the many gangs in @entity18			1
" fragmentation of large organizations like the once - powerful @entity102 cartel has fueled the creation of dozens of smaller criminal gangs battling for turf in the @entity107 port city and the surrounding state , @entity98 said			1
and even though many of the groups are more focused on crimes such as extorting business owners than on drug trafficking , he said , that has n't stemmed the violence			2
authorities have n't been able to get a handle on the problem , said @entity120 , who studies security at @entity3 's @entity122 in @entity123			1
" basically the government ca n't control them , " he said			0
" this is just one example of the climate of insecurity that @entity50 has been living			0
" particular regions of @entity3 -- often those near the border and along lucrative trafficking routes -- have borne the brunt of the country 's drug - related violence			1
@entity138 , official figures indicate violence in @entity3 may be declining			1
in 2012 , there were 20,568 intentional homicides across the country , an 8.5 % decrease from 2011			0
" 2012 was the first year when it fell , but we are still double where we were in 2007 , " @entity98 said			0
experts caution that reliable statistics are hard to come by			2
last year the government stopped releasing its tally of deaths tied to organized crime , which had become a measure many used to debate the success of then - president @entity156 's drug war			1
now only more general homicide statistics are released , without describing the circumstances			0
it 's unclear whether @entity3 has turned a corner , @entity61 said , but the fact that cities like @entity67 and @entity163 have seen violence drop gives some hope for the future			1
" if they can turn things around , then there 's no reason why every other city in @entity3 ca n't do the same thing , " @entity61 said			1
" we now have success stories , which we could n't say three years ago			0
" a new president changes the tone even if the numbers may be shifting in his favor , @entity3 's new president has n't been talking much about violence			1
right before he took office , @entity31 began a trip to the @entity183 in november saying that ties between the neighboring nations must go beyond the drug war			2
in @entity3 now , the once - common government press conferences presenting high - profile cartel captures seem to be a thing of the past			1
" there 's a belief that they have that the criminal groups do sort of take advantage of the media and the attention in order to create fear , basically , and therefore space to act with impunity , " @entity61 said			2
" so the government decided deliberately they wo n't parade recently arrested criminals in front of the cameras			0
" that 's a marked change from his predecessor , @entity156 , who announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office in december 2006			2
the war on drugs became a hallmark of his presidency , and the death toll from drug - related violence during his tenure had soared to more than 47,500 when the government stopped releasing updated figures in early 2012 -- his last year in office			1
in farewell speeches , @entity156 noted that 25 of @entity3 's 37 most wanted criminals had been apprehended on his watch			2
" the government of @entity31 is trying not to talk about the issue of violence , " said @entity120			1
" it 's a strategy to change perceptions			1
" the reason is clear , said @entity234 , who studied @entity3 's ruthless @entity236 cartel for his 2012 book " @entity239 's men			2
" " you do n't want to talk about your crazy aunt in the attic			0
... they want to shift the narrative , " he said			0
on the campaign trail last year , @entity31 vowed to reduce violence and said he 'd take a different tack -- an election promise that played well with voters in a country weary of a drug war with a growing body count			1
but two months into his six - year presidency , analysts say it 's still unclear how he 'll accomplish that goal			2
" what he wants to crack down on are kidnappings , extortion , what 's more likely to affect average people			0
there 's been no secret that he wants to move in that direction and use more of a scalpel than a broad sword in combating the cartels , " @entity234 said , " and he seems to have sent a subliminal message to the cartels saying that if you just conduct your business and do n't disturb civilians , we 're not going to ignore you , but you 're not a top priority			0
" @entity31 has stressed that fixing social and economic problems will foster peace in @entity3 , and he 's made some security policy shifts			1
he started his term by eliminating the public safety ministry and placing the federal police it once controlled under the interior ministry 's power			0
he 's also discussed a plan to divide the country into regions to tackle security problems and to create a new national gendarmerie force , which could eventually send @entity3 's military out of the streets and back into their barracks			2
but the time frame for those changes is uncertain			0
and in the meantime , discussing violence less does n't make the longstanding systemic problems fueling it go away , @entity120 said			2
" it is important for any government to talk about other topics , like the economy			0
but you ca n't negate what is happening , what people are still experiencing , " he said			0
' we are left with no other choice ' in some areas of @entity3 , residents are tired of waiting for the government to step in to solve their problems			1
" what we are seeing in a lot of parts of the country is a vacuum of the state ... and the proliferation of private security corps , of paramilitary groups , " @entity120 said			2
incidents like the tourist attack in @entity50 will only do more to promote that approach , @entity120 said , noting that it raises worrying concerns about abuses by vigilantes taking the law into their own hands			0
" the government is overcome			0
... that 's the tragedy , " he said			0
" there is no short - term solution			2
" as word of this week 's rape allegations in @entity18 spread , a group of people in one nearby neighborhood took a vote on tuesday			1
if local , state and federal officials ca n't track down and apprehend those responsible , they decided they 'll take matters into their own hands			0
" we are going to have to rise up with weapons			0
... we can not wait until they keep destroying the port of @entity18 with these kinds of incidents , " said @entity351 , president of a 35 - member association of restaurant and business owners in @entity18 's @entity357 beach community			1
" we think the government is very timid , very slow			0
if there is no immediate response , it leaves us no choice but to join the fight and set up checkpoints on the street corners			0
" months ago , he read about other groups in the region taking similar steps , forming paramilitary self - defense groups of masked men that patrol the streets			0
at first , it seemed extreme			0
now , it sounds sensible , he said			0
in this area where the economy relies on tourism , he said , residents are tired of waiting for authorities to take action			0
but it 's not just that a high - profile crime targeting tourists is bad for business			1
" today they were foreigners , " said @entity351 , who owns a restaurant that specializes in serving up freshly caught seafood			0
" tomorrow it could be our families			0
" @entity50 is named for a military general who fought for @entity3 's independence from @entity397			2
it 's also the @entity10 word for warrior			2
if the government ca n't protect them , @entity351 says it 's time for the state 's residents to fight back			0
more : @entity404 takes justice into their own hands @entity0 's @entity407 , @entity408 and @entity409 and @entity46 's @entity410 contributed to this report .			0
