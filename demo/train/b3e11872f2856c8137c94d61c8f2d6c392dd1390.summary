-- the @entity2 is still trying to link @entity4 leader @entity3 , his son and his brother - in - law to rapes , but it does not yet have enough evidence to do so , prosecutor @entity1 said tuesday			1
it has evidence that rapes have taken place in @entity4 's civil war , he said , but he can not prove @entity3 ordered them			1
the court issued arrest warrants monday for @entity3 , his son @entity15 , and his brother - in - law @entity16 on other charges			1
@entity15 is a close adviser to his father			0
his arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday			0
@entity21 serves as @entity3 's head of intelligence			2
the warrants are " for crimes against humanity , " including murder and persecution , " allegedly committed across @entity4 " from february 15 through " at least " february 28 , " through the state apparatus and security forces , " the court said in a news release			1
the court could file charges against " one or two other names , but in principle the first investigation focuses on these individuals , " @entity1 said tuesday			0
the court is not asking international forces operating in @entity4 to arrest the suspects , he said , explaining that @entity4 has the primary responsibility to do so as a @entity42 member			1
@entity43 confirmed in a news conference that it is not seeking to arrest anyone , as that is not part of its mission			2
lt. gen. @entity50 of @entity43 gave a mixed assessment of the mission to protect civilians , saying @entity4 were writing " thank you , @entity43 " on their roofs			1
but , he said , @entity3 's forces were using civilians as human shields , making @entity43 operations " more difficult , but not impossible			1
" and he said @entity43 had reports that government forces had " put down very severely " attempts to demonstrate against @entity3 's rule			1
" security forces continue to inflict pain and harm on the population , " @entity62 said at a briefing in @entity64 , @entity65 , where @entity66 is based			0
@entity43 struck civilian and military locations in the @entity74 area of @entity75 on tuesday , @entity4 state tv reported without further details			1
elsewhere tuesday , rebels attacked a government weapons depot some 30 kilometers south of @entity79 , an opposition stronghold in western @entity4			1
it was a location that had previously been a target of @entity43 attacks			0
two people died and four were injured in the fighting , according to @entity85 , a doctor stationed at the depot			0
rebels overtook government forces and were later seen carting away ammunition , he said			0
at the @entity2 , @entity1 insisted it is only a matter of time until @entity3 is arrested , pointing out that @entity93 war crimes suspect @entity94 was finally seized more than 15 years after a warrant for his arrest was issued			1
" the arrest warrants are not going away , " he said , noting that 161 warrants had been issued in connection with the yugoslav wars of the early 1990s -- and that 160 suspects have been seized			1
@entity4 rebels could also face arrest warrants , @entity1 said			1
but " by far the greatest crimes committed in @entity4 are committed by the @entity3 forces , " he said , explaining why the court investigation began with them			1
and he batted away questions from reporters about whether an @entity2 arrest warrant would discourage @entity3 from stepping down , saying the decision to investigate him came from a unanimous @entity113 resolution , not the court			1
it was " not our idea , " he said			0
in rebel - held @entity119 , where fighting has raged , a crowd cheered monday following the announcement of the arrest warrants			1
the announcement at the @entity125 came as fighting inside @entity4 inched closer to the capital			0
a rebel fighter , @entity128 , told @entity0 that rebel forces were 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) from @entity75 on monday			0
@entity4 is not a signatory to the @entity131 that established the international court 's authority , but @entity1 said tuesday it still had a responsibility to arrest @entity3 and his allies because it is a member of the @entity42 , which ordered the investigation			1
he said the rebels could also arrest @entity3 and hand him over			2
the court does not have the power to enter @entity4 and arrest the leaders			2
the @entity113 referred the matter to the @entity2 through a resolution february 26 , following widespread complaints about @entity3 's efforts to crush a rebellion			2
the resolution said that , while " states not party to the @entity131 have no obligations under the statute , the @entity113 urged all states and concerned regional and other international organisations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor			0
" @entity3 's backers rejected the court 's authority			2
" this court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of @entity43 , " said @entity4 justice minister @entity159			1
" it is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries			0
" @entity4 deputy foreign minister @entity168 offered a similar view			0
" both the @entity2 and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone , let alone the @entity4 people , " he said			2
@entity177 , an analyst with the conservative @entity178 , said the court 's move could damage efforts to get @entity3 to end his 42 - year reign , because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the @entity131			2
" the @entity2 's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law , " @entity177 said			0
" while the @entity2 makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law , the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that @entity3 could flee to a retirement haven outside @entity4			2
in effect , the @entity2 arrest warrant tells @entity3 to fight to the death			0
" most @entity203 countries are parties or signatories to the @entity131			0
the @entity2 website lists a total of 47 non-signatories in the world , 13 of them in @entity203 and the @entity211			0
journalist @entity212 contributed to this report .			0
