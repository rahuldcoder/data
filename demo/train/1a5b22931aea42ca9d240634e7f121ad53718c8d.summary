@entity0 , @entity1 -- a military site containing what appears to be radioactive material has been uncovered by revolutionary forces near the southern @entity1 city of @entity0			1
military forces loyal to the country 's @entity9 took a @entity2 crew thursday to the site , not far from @entity0 in the @entity14 desert			2
the crew saw two large warehouses there , one containing thousands of blue barrels , some marked with tape saying " radioactive , " and several plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape			1
the material has not been confirmed as being radioactive , but the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , the @entity27 ' nuclear watchdog agency , confirmed thursday that the @entity1 government had yellowcake stored near @entity0			1
yellowcake is processed uranium ore that can , after extensive refining , be used to produce enriched uranium for nuclear purposes			0
fighters entered @entity0 , long regarded as a @entity38 stronghold , on wednesday afternoon and met initially no resistance , officials said			0
elsewhere , revolutionaries have taken control of the southwestern town of @entity44 , chasing toops loyal to now - deposed leader @entity46 from the area as @entity1 's new leaders continued to gain momentum , @entity9 field commander @entity40 said thursday			1
in another event likely boost to revolutionary morale , @entity1 's most recent prime minister under the @entity46 regime , @entity51 , was arrested wednesday night in @entity55 , the government confirmed to @entity2 thursday			1
@entity57 was detained in @entity58 , near @entity55 's border with @entity60 , the @entity55 interior ministry said , having entered @entity55 illegally without a visa			1
he was attempting to cross into @entity60 at the time of his arrest , a ministry spokesman said			0
" i believe the @entity1 people will want to see him brought to @entity1 and put on trial here for his crimes under @entity46 's rule , " @entity65 , an @entity9 spokesman , told @entity2			1
the @entity9 has not yet formally requested @entity51 's extradition , he added			0
the @entity60 government on thursday also declared its willingness to work " closely " with the new @entity1 authorities , the official @entity73 reported			2
this cooperation would benefit both countries and " stimulate the appropriate conditions to maintain peace , security and stability in the region , " the foreign ministry said in a statement quoted by @entity73			0
@entity60 had previously declined to recognize the @entity9 as the new government in @entity1			2
a number of @entity46 family members , including his wife and three of his children , fled @entity1 for @entity60 last month			1
in another sign that stability may be returning to @entity1 , the @entity92 reopened its embassy in @entity96 thursday , in the former residence of the @entity92 ambassador to @entity1			1
the old embassy building in the center of the city was trashed by @entity46 supporters in may			2
the military site outside @entity0 , found wednesday night , is now guarded by about a dozen lightly - armed revolutionary fighters			1
it does not appear to have been left unfrequented for long			0
protective suits were found hanging in offices that appear previously to have belonged to the @entity1 government , along with rubber gloves , devices for measuring radioactivity and various military documents			2
the second warehouse at the site contains rockets and old surface - to - air missiles on which the fuses have deteriorated , making them liable to explode if they 're struck			0
a field commander for the revolutionary forces said the @entity9 wanted the international community to come in , identify the suspect material and take it to a place of safekeeping			0
the forces fear it could cause an environmental disaster if it were to explode during fighting , he said			0
@entity128 , a defense expert at @entity129 , told @entity2 the elderly rockets might pose a greater threat to safety than the suspected radioactive material			2
the discovery of the material is not a surprise , he said , as the @entity25 had established that yellowcake was at the site			2
the current status of the material is not known , however			0
a @entity141 official , who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the issue , told @entity2 that @entity1 's remaining stock of highly enriched uranium was removed from the country as of 2009			1
" we also continue to monitor @entity1 's stockpile of uranium yellowcake , " the official said			1
" this material would need to go through an extensive industrial process , including enrichment , before it could be used in building a bomb			0
such processes do not exist in @entity1			2
" the official said it was important that the @entity9 fully secured the site and that it worked to allow international monitors to return to @entity1 as soon as possible			1
@entity159 , a spokeswoman for the @entity25 , said it could confirm that previously declared yellowcake was stored in drums at a site near @entity0			2
" the @entity25 has tentatively scheduled safeguards activities at this location once the situation in the country stabilizes , " she said in a statement			0
these " safeguards " measures would not mean the @entity25 was physically protecting the material -- a national responsibility -- but rather that it was carrying out technical checks on what was there to avoid proliferation , she said			0
@entity1 declared its previously covert nuclear program in december 2003 and @entity46 's government cooperated with verification efforts by the @entity25 from that point on			1
an @entity25 report from 2008 states that @entity1 had declared that between 1978 and 1981 it imported 2,263 tonnes of uranium ore concentrate , which was being stored at @entity0			0
however , plans to build a uranium ore concentration and conversion facility in the @entity0 area were not carried out , the report says			0
the latest territorial gains by the revolutionary forces come days after the @entity9 received the significant milestone of being recognized by @entity189 and the @entity190 as @entity1 's legitimate rulers			1
troops loyal to @entity1 's new leaders have been putting pressure on several regime holdout cities in recent days			1
along with thursday 's military action in @entity44 , fighters also clashed with @entity46 loyalists in the northern town of @entity200 and in @entity201			1
@entity202 , an @entity9 military spokesman speaking in @entity96 thursday , said revolutionary fighters had encountered mercenaries who appeared to be from @entity205 or @entity206 , and had uncovered caches of weapons and military supplies			0
he said most of the towns in southern @entity1 had been " liberated " from @entity46 loyalists and that revolutionary forces would continue to fight for control of @entity200			1
" our revolutionaries wo n't lose hope , " he said			0
despite not yet having complete control over the entire country , the @entity9 says it is planning on how to set up a new government			0
@entity219 , a senior member of the @entity9 , told @entity2 wednesday that the formation of a @entity1 government will not be announced until @entity223 forces control the borders of the country and liberate the three cities of @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity0			2
that effort could take up to one month , he said			0
after liberation , the @entity9 will create an interim government by appointing a prime minister who will be responsible for forming the government			1
the prime minister will decide how many ministers will be in that interim government , but he must return to the @entity9 for approval of that government			1
that government will create a new constitution that will be put before the @entity1 people for approval in a referendum			0
@entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
