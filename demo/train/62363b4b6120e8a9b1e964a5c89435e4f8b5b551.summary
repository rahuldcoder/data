bloodstained pavement , a woman 's compact , a pair of shattered spectacles , a single shoe covered in dust were among the debris left by a devastating series of explosions that hit the headquarters of the @entity12 separatists in the eastern @entity14 city of @entity15 on monday			1
the carnage was sudden , unexpected			0
this was the middle of a city , a building adjacent to a leafy square , where civilians walked and worked			1
eight people were killed , five women and three men , according to the self - declared @entity26 ; the authorities in @entity28 reported the same tally			1
but there the agreement ends			0
the @entity12 leadership in the city immediately accused the @entity14 air force of carrying out the attack			1
a fighter jet had been flying overhead at the time , and social media video appeared to show it firing cannon or rockets			0
the authorities in @entity28 denied its planes had been involved			0
initially , the anti-terrorist operation said the explosion originated from inside the building , then that an anti-aircraft missile operated by the separatists had misfired , reacting to heat from an air - conditioning system on the outside of the building			1
but a @entity51 investigation in @entity15 has found clear evidence that whatever detonations hit the building and the adjoining park came from the air			1
the tops of trees were splintered , and a series of small craters -- about a dozen -- had been blasted in a straight line , starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building , blowing out many of its windows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel			1
that 's what appears to have killed most of the victims and injured 20 more			1
the pattern of the craters clearly indicated some sort of strafing , according to a munitions expert at the scene with @entity51			1
their size suggested 30 - millimeter ordnance , he said , which is standard equipment on the @entity85 , a ground attack fighter , and the @entity83 -- both combat aircraft operated by @entity14			2
the @entity91 of the @entity92 came to a similar conclusion , releasing a statement late tuesday that said : " based on the @entity91 's limited observation , these strikes were the result of non-guided rockets shot from an aircraft			0
" it 's thought to be the first time that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack by the @entity14 air force since pro-russian groups began occupying buildings in the @entity15 and @entity104 regions more than two months ago			1
the self - declared prime - minister of the @entity26 of @entity15 , @entity106 , told @entity51 he hoped the attack would spur @entity108 president @entity107 to action			1
" we appealed to @entity108 to send us peacekeepers			0
i think after they see what happened to us in the center of our town , they 'll send them more quickly , " he said			0
@entity106 said he was ready to provide all the evidence collected to independent experts			0
@entity121 , @entity122 editor of @entity123 , told @entity51 he believed the @entity14 air force " used their @entity125 ' ground attack aircraft during the operation in @entity15			1
it is specifically designed for attacking ground targets -- unlike the @entity83 , which is principally a fighter aircraft			0
" the planes were flying to provide support for a base of the @entity132 on the edge of the city			2
why one may have targeted the administrative building , several miles away , is unknown			2
the @entity138 compound , in a southern suburb of @entity15 , came under attack before dawn monday			1
it was a concerted assault from several directions , involving hundreds of pro-russian militants , and continued for some 12 hours			0
on a visit to the site tuesday , a @entity51 team found dozens of spent cartridges in several locations around the base , whose buildings had also been hit by rocket - propelled grenades			1
part of the roof of the main building hung precariously in the strong wind			2
vehicles outside had been burned out , the fuel dump blown up			0
by late afternoon , only a token force of separatists were still in place , using blocks of apartments within 100 meters of the base as protection			2
they cradled brand new assault rifles and carried boxes of ammunition but insisted they were local men			2
patches of dried blood marked the place where one of several militants killed or wounded monday had been hit by gunfire from the base			2
one of the separatists , who gave his name as @entity181 , said , " they call this an anti-terror operation , but it 's wrong			2
when they use air force against their own people , it 's wrong			0
" he dismissed @entity14 's president - elect , @entity191 , as " illegitimate			0
" @entity181 and other fighters said the base had been attacked because it was the hub for @entity14 patrols along a several - hundred - kilometer stretch of the nearby border with @entity108 -- an area that has seen increased infiltration by @entity108 militants and weapons in recent weeks			0
several soldiers inside the compound were also injured in the clashes , and windows in the adjoining apartment blocks were pock - marked with bullet holes			0
as @entity51 filmed , two men raced into the base through its charred gate - house			1
the battle for eastern @entity14 is intensifying			0
the casualties are rising , as are the number of @entity12 separatists and the roadblocks dotted throughout the region			1
and in some areas , the only obvious presence of the @entity14 state is in the sky .			0

five women and three men were killed in explosions at @entity12 building in @entity15
@entity226 , separatists trade blame for the air attack in the middle of the city
@entity51 investigation shows that explosives came from the air despite government denial
