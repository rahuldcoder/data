-- it 's not easy carrying the burden of a sports - mad nation 's lofty expectations of world - beating dominance on your shoulders , especially on home soil , but @entity10 did it -- with a broken foot			1
battered and bruised , and knowing that the @entity14 ' other iconic star player , @entity13 , had already been ruled out for the rest of the @entity16 , @entity10 soldiered on for three crucial matches -- four hours of on - field punishment he hid the extent of his injury from fans , media , his coaches and teammates to keep alive his dream of being the first @entity14 captain to lift the @entity28 trophy for almost a quarter of a century			1
" the team had been number one in the world , or close to it , for a lot of years during the disappointment of not winning it , " @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity30 series			1
" we had a team that was good enough , but it does n't mean anything when you get to a tournament like that , if you do n't put it on the field where it counts			2
" there was heartache along the way , but the appreciation of what you 've done ... i certainly appreciated it			0
the first emotions were sheer relief that we 'd finally been able to knock it off			0
had we not gone through that , maybe it would n't mean as much as it did			0
" when it comes to rugby , @entity58 expect victory			2
defeat is rare -- and as painful as the body blows that are routine for those who play one of the world 's most physically demanding sports			0
the traditional @entity70 war dance that the @entity14 perform before every match -- known as " the @entity72 " -- is one of the most fearsome , and highly anticipated , sights on the international rugby stage			1
" it is something very unique to @entity14 , " @entity10 said			1
" it 's who we are and were we come from ... a little island way down south , a long way from anywhere			0
it 's a pretty powerful symbol of what the @entity14 and @entity14 is all about			1
" so it was a matter of great national hurt that the @entity14 had not been world champions since winning the inaugural tournament in 1987 , also at home			1
" up until the ( 2011 ) @entity92 , everyone acknowledged , " ah the @entity14 are great , ' but there was always a ' but ' -- i suppose because they had n't won the @entity92			1
to not have that ' but ' anymore was pretty satisfying , " @entity10 said			1
@entity10 knows all about winning			1
having become first @entity14 to achieve a century of @entity97 appearances during the @entity16 , this year he reached 100 victories from just 112 appearances -- a phenomenal strike rate			1
he suffered heartbreak in 2003 , losing in the @entity92 semifinals to arch - rivals @entity104 , and in 2007 the @entity14 crashed out ignominiously against @entity105 in the quarterfinals , leading @entity10 to reconsider his future as captain			1
instead of making wholesale changes , the @entity58 regrouped and went into the 2011 tournament -- once again -- as hot favorites			1
@entity10 reached his century of caps in the third pool game against @entity105 , but his foot problem ruled him out of the match against @entity117 -- and international rugby 's record points scorer @entity13 , who was to replace him as captain , then suffered a tournament - ending injury in training			1
" i did n't know what to say to @entity13 , " @entity10 recalls in his autobiography " @entity124			2
" " here 's a guy , a decent humble man , acknowledged to be the best of his generation , perhaps of any generation , who 's been crocked at the top of his game just when he 's about to perform on the biggest stage			0
" i 've had the odd moment since @entity13 went down this afternoon where i thought , ' @entity135 , it could be the two of us			0
' but sitting with @entity13 , i know that it ca n't be me now			0
no moaning about my foot			2
unlike @entity13 , i 've still got a chance of playing and somehow , any old how , that 's what i 've got to do			2
" @entity10 returned for the quarterfinal against @entity145 , in which teammate @entity146 became the second @entity14 to win 100 caps but then went off with a fractured shoulder			1
the injury crisis was mounting , and @entity10 had his own worries			2
" if i have to jump or run or push or tackle , i can do it -- adrenaline 's a great painkiller			0
but when play stops and i have to walk or jog to a lineout or scrum 20 meters away , i 'm really struggling			0
" he says in his book			0
@entity10 played the full 80 minutes in a 20 - 6 crushing of @entity104 , then held on to the bittersweet end in a nerve - wracking 8 - 7 win over @entity105 in the title decider -- a rematch of the 1987 final that he had watched as a boy			1
" i was about age 6 and watching it on tv			0
the image that i have in my head is @entity169 scoring one of the tries , " he said			0
" that sort of stuck with me i suppose			0
i thought it would be pretty cool to be like him			0
" while @entity169 was one of @entity14 's star backs , @entity10 would go on to follow in the rugged boot prints of legendary forwards such @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			1
he has been named world player of the year three times , drawing both respect and anger from opponents and critics for his uncanny ability to tread the fine line between smart thinking and illegal play -- as did one of his predecessors as skipper , 1987 @entity92 winner @entity193			1
having finally landed @entity14 's holy grail , @entity10 is hoping to play at the next @entity92 in @entity195 in 2015 , when he 'll be 35			1
but after a long career as one of the most dynamic and influential forwards in rugby , it 's time to take a break -- a six - month sabbatical in which he plans to get away from it all			1
he has plenty of incentive to come back stronger -- his last match was a shock defeat to @entity195 last month which ended the @entity14 ' 20 - match unbeaten run			1
" i hope having the time off will make me play a bit longer			0
so i 'm taking it before i desperately need it , with the hope i 'll come back fresh mentally and physically , " he said			2
" i 'm pretty keen to get away and have a look at places i 've have n't been before and where rugby is not something people know too much about			2
that 's part of what wears you down a little bit , when you are living in fishbowl like you do in @entity14 , and it 's just nice to have a bit of time to be anonymous			2
" @entity10 has hinted that he will head to the @entity229 and indulge his other passion -- flying			1
his grandfather was a fighter pilot during @entity233 , and he has continued the family interest , being named an honorary squadron leader in the @entity14 @entity236			2
he flies planes , helicopters and gliders , and has even narrated an aviation tv program			2
" @entity241 flies , his brothers fly , a couple of my cousins fly , my aunty flies			0
we 've got flying in common			2
when i go home to the old man we sit and talk way more about flying than rugby , " @entity10 says in " @entity124			1
" " @entity251 teaches you that you 've got to be prepared as you possibly can for whatever contingencies of terrain and weather might eventuate when you 're up there			0
at the same time , you have to acknowledge that no matter how much you prepare , no matter how thorough you are , you ca n't anticipate everything that @entity259 and fate throw at you			0
" when he returns from his sabbatical in mid- 2013 , @entity10 knows that the rugby world will be trying to knock him and the @entity14 off their pedestal			1
" a lot of people ask me what 's left to achieve or why do you still want to play			0
i guess you readjust the challenges , " he told @entity0			0
" you have the tag of world champions for four years -- you try to live up to that every time			0
i know what it 's like , i 've tried to knock off the world champs the following year			0
" if we have that sort of goal , that sort of attitude , hopefully we will keep that level where it needs to be			0

he played through the last three games of the 2011 tournament with a broken foot
@entity10 is taking a six - month sabbatical from rugby in order to extend his playing career
the *31* - year - old is hoping to *explore* his other passion of flying gliders and planes
