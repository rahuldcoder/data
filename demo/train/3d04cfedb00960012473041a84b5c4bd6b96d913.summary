two @entity1 missionary workers infected with the deadly ebola virus were given an experimental drug that seems to have saved their lives			1
dr. @entity5 was given the medication , @entity7 , shortly after telling his doctors he thought he would die , according to a source familiar with his case			1
within an hour , doctors say his symptoms -- labored breathing and a widespread rash -- dramatically improved			0
@entity16 , another missionary working with @entity17 , received two doses of the medication and has also shown significant improvement , sources say			0
as there is no proven treatment and no vaccine for @entity24 , this experimental drug is raising lots of questions			1
who makes the drug ? the drug was developed by the biotech firm @entity30 , which is based in @entity31			1
the company was founded in 2003 " to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases , focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense , " according to its website			0
@entity30 has been working with the @entity41 and the @entity42 , an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction , to develop an @entity24 treatment for several years			1
are there other experimental @entity24 drugs out there ? yes			1
in march , the @entity41 awarded a five - year , $ 28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight @entity24			1
" a whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic , and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why , " a news release about the grant said			0
@entity62 , a @entity63 - based company that has a $ 140 million contract with the @entity1 @entity65 to develop an @entity24 drug , began phase 1 trials with its drug in january			1
but the @entity69 recently halted the trial , asking for more information			0
at least one potential @entity24 vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers , according to @entity74 , a leading researcher at the @entity75			1
and last week , the @entity41 announced a safety trial of another @entity24 vaccine will start as early as september			2
how does @entity7 work ? antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign , or harmful , cells			1
a monoclonal antibody is similar , except it 's engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell , according to the @entity86 , mimicking your immune system 's natural response			0
monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions			0
sources told @entity94 the medicine given to @entity5 and @entity16 abroad was a three - mouse monoclonal antibody , meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine			2
however , the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants			1
@entity7 manufacturer @entity107 in @entity108 has been working with @entity17 and @entity109 to provide limited quantities of the drug to @entity109 , according to company spokesman @entity112			1
why did @entity1 missionary workers get the drug ? many have asked why these two workers received the experimental drug when so many -- around 1,600 -- others in @entity119 also have the virus			1
the @entity121 says it was not involved in the decision to treat @entity5 and @entity16			0
both patients had to give consent to receive the drug , knowing it had never been tested in humans before			2
the process by which the medication was made available to the @entity1 patients may have fallen under the @entity69 's " compassionate use " regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials			1
did doctors know it would work ? no. the drug had shown promise in primates , but even in those experiments , just eight monkeys received the treatment			0
in any case , the human immune system can react differently than primates ' , which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use			0
the two @entity1 ' cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems			1
will the drug be made available to other @entity24 patients ? it 's unclear			1
@entity158 out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult , @entity157 said in a statement			0
experimental drugs typically not mass - produced , and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce			2
dr. @entity167 , director of the @entity168 , says scientists have to be careful about assuming this drug will work in other patients as it appears to have worked in @entity172			2
" having worked with administering antibodies for people for a really long time , that would be distinctly unusual , " he told @entity94			0
" as we all know in medicine ... you have to withhold judgment			0
does the company have more vials of the drug ? the company has very few doses ready for patient use , @entity167 told @entity94			2
" ( @entity107 ) is working closely with @entity186 , various government agencies , and other parties to increase production of @entity7 , but this process will take several months , " @entity112 said			2
who paid for the drug and how much did it cost ? we do n't know			0
@entity17 covered the cost of @entity5 and @entity16 's evacuations but did not pay for the drug , according to a spokesman			2
when a patient gets an experimental drug , the drug company can donate the product under compassionate use			2
@entity204 might have done that in this case			0
health insurance companies typically do not pick up the tab for treatments that have not been approved by the @entity69			0
but they usually would cover the cost of any doctor fees associated with giving the drug and any costs associated with monitoring how the drug is working			0
would this drug stop the @entity24 epidemic ? if it were widely available , it certainly could n't hurt			1
an effective @entity24 drug could help doctors treat the deadly virus , which is killing about 60 % of the people infected in @entity119			1
but a vaccine would be a much more effective tool in stopping this , and future , epidemics			0
vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent them from ever becoming infected			0
one challenge with @entity24 , experts say , is that companies do n't believe they could make much money from developing a vaccine , so few companies show interest .			2

ebola drug @entity7 can be produced using tobacco plant proteins
ebola drug given to @entity1 developed by a company based in @entity31
it 's unclear whether the drug will be administered to other @entity24 patients
