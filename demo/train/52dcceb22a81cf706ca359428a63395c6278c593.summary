@entity0 -- president @entity2 on thursday made official the long - held but rarely stated @entity4 support for a future @entity6 state based on borders that existed before the 1967 @entity9 war			1
in the past , the @entity4 has unofficially backed a two - state solution to the @entity12 - @entity6 conflict based on the borders in place prior to the war 44 years ago in which @entity12 seized the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
in a major speech thursday , @entity2 became the first president to formally endorse the policy , but he also acknowledged the need for modifications through the negotiating process due to conditions on the ground			0
" the @entity4 believes that negotiations should result in two states , with permanent @entity6 borders with @entity12 , @entity35 , and @entity36 , and permanent @entity12 borders with @entity38 , " @entity2 said in the concluding section of his 45 - minute address that looked at political and social change sweeping across the @entity9 and @entity31			1
" we believe the borders of @entity12 and @entity38 should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states , " @entity2 continued			2
his position agreed with the @entity6 negotiating stance on border issues in the staggering peace process , now stalled again by disputes over @entity12 settlements in the @entity16 and the role of @entity52 -- a terrorist group in the eyes of the @entity4 and @entity12 -- in the @entity6 leadership			1
at the same time , @entity2 reiterated unwavering @entity4 support for @entity12 's security , and he endorsed major negotiating positions of prime minister @entity60 's government , including an incremental handover of security responsibilities by @entity12 when conditions on the ground allow it			1
@entity2 declared the @entity4 commitment to @entity12 's security " unshakable , " and said " every state has the right to self - defense , and @entity12 must be able to defend itself -- by itself -- against any threat			1
" " provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism ; to stop the infiltration of weapons ; and to provide effective border security , " @entity2 continued , touching on the major concerns of @entity12 in facing a new @entity6 neighbor			1
" the full and phased withdrawal of @entity12 military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of @entity6 security responsibility in a sovereign , non-militarized state			1
and the duration of this transition period must be agreed , and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated			0
" in a later interview with the @entity89 , @entity2 said that " the basis for negotiations will involve looking at that 1967 border , recognizing that conditions on the ground have changed and there are going to need to be swaps to accommodate the interests of both sides			0
" " that 's on the one hand and on the other hand , and this was an equally important part of the speech , @entity12 is going to have to feel confident about its security on the @entity16 and that security element is going to be important to the @entity12			0
" @entity2 said in the interview			0
@entity106 , the former @entity107 prime minister now working as part of international efforts to secure an @entity12 - @entity6 peace agreement , said the security assurances and provisions are essential to the territorial issue			2
" i think it 's saying in essence , that the @entity6 have got to be sure that their state is viable in terms of territory , " @entity106 told @entity1 shortly after @entity2 spoke			1
" obviously , there are going to be deviations or changes ( from the exact 1967 borders ) that are mutually agreeable			0
" on the other hand , @entity106 said , @entity12 has the right to protect itself			0
as expected , initial reaction was mostly negative			0
a statement from @entity60 's office rejected what it called a withdrawal to the 1967 borders , calling them " indefensible " and noting it would leave major @entity12 population centers in @entity6 territory			1
@entity52 also rejected the speech			0
political opponents also criticized @entity2 , with possible @entity137 presidential candidate @entity136 saying the president had " thrown @entity12 under the bus			1
" " he has disrespected @entity12 and undermined its ability to negotiate peace , " @entity136 said in a statement			2
" he has also violated a first principle of @entity4 foreign policy , which is to stand firm by our friends			0
" the president used his speech to speak directly to both @entity12 and @entity6 , declaring that both sides must yield on some deeply entrenched positions in order to bring peace that is desired and needed by both the region and the world			2
he criticized both sides for " unmet " expectations despite decades of efforts by @entity4 administrations , including his own , to facilitate an agreement			0
in particular , @entity2 cited @entity12 's insistence on building new housing settlements on the @entity16 and other areas beyond its 1967 borders			1
on thursday , @entity12 announced the approval of projects to build 1,500 housing units in @entity166 and @entity167 , which are outside the 1967 borders			0
@entity169 , an @entity170 spokesman , said the projects had previously received initial approval			0
" the status quo is unsustainable , and @entity12 too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace , " @entity2 said , adding that " the dream of a @entity176 and democratic state can not be fulfilled with permanent occupation			2
" @entity2 also rejected any @entity6 effort to challenge @entity12 's right to exist , saying they would " end in failure			1
" he noted an expected push for a symbolic @entity185 resolution in september " wo n't create an independent state			0
" while calling for positive steps by both sides on territory and security issues , @entity2 said he recognized two " wrenching and emotional issues " remain unresolved -- the future status of @entity192 , which is claimed by both sides , and the fate of @entity6 refugees who claim @entity12 as their homeland			1
@entity2 also repeated the strong @entity4 opposition to @entity52 playing a leadership role unless it recognizes @entity12 's right to exist and renounces terrorism			1
" the recent announcement of an agreement between @entity203 and @entity52 raises profound and legitimate questions for @entity12 -- how can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist , " @entity2 said			2
" in the weeks and months to come , @entity6 leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question			0
" @entity60 's statement cited the refugee and @entity52 issues as major obstacles to renewed peace talks sought by @entity2			2
" without a solution to the @entity6 refugee problem outside the borders of @entity12 , no territorial concession will bring peace , " said the statement , adding that @entity60 -- who will meet with @entity2 on friday in @entity0 -- " will also express his disappointment over the @entity219 's decision to embrace @entity52 , a terror organization committed to @entity12 's destruction			1
" @entity2 acknowledged the " suspicion and hostility " that impeded the peace process , but added he was " convinced that the majority of @entity12 and @entity6 would rather look to the future than be trapped in the past			2
" @entity1 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
