-- three choices , and you only get to pick one : of these three developments that took place in the second half of the 20th century , which has had the most enduring impact on our lives today ? 1			1
the building of the interstate highway system			1
the blanketing of the @entity13 with coast - to - coast television			1
the introduction and spread of the @entity17			1
we 're finally far enough into the 21st century that we can look at the previous one with the perspective that comes with distance			1
@entity13 life prior to 1950 felt nothing like @entity13 life feels now , and a big reason is those three changes			1
they , more than any fleeting headline event or arcane political controversy , transformed everything ; the question for you is , which of them changed things the most ? before the interstates were constructed , the country felt pretty hemmed in			2
even a trip within an individual state often took considerable planning ; two - lane roads , dangerous and slow , were common , and people did n't leave their hometowns on a whim			2
the interstates -- the official name , still , is the @entity46 -- tore down the invisible walls around @entity13 towns			1
president @entity49 was in favor of building the interstates ( often said to be the biggest public works project in the history of the world ) because he believed that , in a time of war , they would be helpful in moving troops and supplies			0
but their immediate effect was to make @entity13 feel that certain doors had been unlocked			1
with the interstates came an exhilarating sense of freedom : a person could drive anywhere -- everywhere -- easily and without paying tolls			0
suddenly , horizons were unlimited			0
" @entity70 " did n't mean quite the same thing it used to			0
you did n't have to stay put			0
the introduction of national television meant that for the first time in history , people in every corner of the country -- people in small towns , in huge cities , in farm communities , in remote villages -- were watching exactly the same thing at exactly the same moment			1
it connected the country , made it cohesive , in a way that even network radio had n't accomplished , and it was because of the transfixing quality of the tv pictures			0
as with the interstates , coast - to - coast television was an antidote to isolation			1
the executives who ran the newly formed television networks had an enormous amount of power			2
their decisions about what to put on the air determined what people would be talking about the next day			0
they , in essence , controlled what people would laugh at and when , what people would cry over and when , what would anger people and when it would anger them			0
the handful of national over-the - air networks , in their early days , were just that dominant			0
@entity13 might as well have been hypnotized , so great was the devotion to the new machine			1
and then , later in the century , the @entity17 came along and with it the promise of the erasure of all symbolic borders			1
if the interstate highways had allowed physical freedom , the @entity17 allowed a different kind of freedom , one unprecedented in human experience			1
it was no coincidence that it was initially referred to as the information superhighway : seemingly overnight , the knowledge ( and trivia and gossip ) of the world was available to anyone with a keyboard and a modem ; people who had never met and would never meet could communicate as if they were lifelong friends			0
the old - time television executives no longer had as firm a grip on how citizens would spend their time ; now the individual at his or her computer terminal was given the power to decide how he or she would be informed , entertained or infuriated at a given moment			2
no one else had the absolute authority to program the individual 's life ; he or she made that decision , moment by moment			2
what in the past might have taken a person a lifetime -- searching for mankind 's recorded wisdom in distant and magnificent libraries -- now , in theory , was available with a series of key taps from one 's room , regardless of how modest			0
what had once seemed inconceivable had , in the blink of an eye , become routine			0
so : the three innovations ended up changing our daily world profoundly -- largely because of them , it is a world that would be almost unrecognizable to our grandparents and great - grandparents			2
each of the three , it can be argued , had certain drawbacks and tradeoffs that we should not ignore : the interstates let us roam at will but weakened our sense of place ; television brought us together , but somehow , in relieving the old sense of forced isolation , it paradoxically introduced a new kind of voluntary isolation as it lured us to stay increasingly within the confines of our walls ; the @entity17 gave us access to the whole planet but locked our attention on a small sheet of plastic or glass			1
the drawbacks are perhaps a discussion for another time			0
what is not debatable is how much influence each of the three developments has had on the way we live our lives today			0
the question is , if you had to choose one of the three as the most far - reaching , the one that has altered our lives -- all right , your life -- the most , which one would it be ? or , to put it another way : which of the three could n't you live without ? there 's no right answer			2
there 's just your answer			0
feel free to come up with it as you drive unfettered down the open highway , as you sit around watching tv or , if you 'd like , by going to the quick vote that you 'll find on this page			2
