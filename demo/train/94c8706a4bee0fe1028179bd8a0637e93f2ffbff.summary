-- the rise of @entity2 as an economic force has brought with it a policy challenge familiar here in the @entity6 : immigration			1
recently crowned the world 's sixth - largest economy , @entity2 has become an immigration magnet , both to low - skilled workers -- some of whom enter illegally -- and high - skilled workers looking for opportunities in the country 's thriving sectors			1
@entity2 historically has been welcoming to immigrants , but the challenge now is more pronounced as the government seeks to accept foreigners while protecting its hard - won prosperity			1
the country faces two simultaneous challenges : how to deal with recent illegal immigration , mostly from @entity26 , and how to make it easier for highly educated immigrants to get work permits			1
a number of @entity2 ministries have either proposed or are deliberating policies as the country ushers in a new era of immigration			1
" you can not become the sixth economy in the world with impunity , " defense minister @entity36 , a former foreign minister , said recently			0
before , people left @entity2 to chase a better life , he said			2
now , the tide has turned			0
" naturally , we have to study how to act during this new situation			0
it 's not just @entity26 , but @entity2 who are returning			1
we have to try to exercise the same humanitarian spirit that 's present in @entity26 ( where @entity2 leads a @entity49 mission ) , and in a manner that compatible with our means , " @entity36 said			1
in 2011 through september , @entity2 processed 52,353 work permits to immigrants , a 32.8 % increase over 2010			2
@entity2 's needs and wants have created the situation where there are ideas to limit the entry of some immigrants and entice the entry of others			2
in recent decades in @entity2 , the education levels of the population have increased significantly , said @entity66 , a demographer and professor at the @entity68 , @entity2			2
in that period , an increase in the number of educated workers meant more competition for jobs and a negative impact on wages , he said			0
" but this negative impact is decreasing because we have the demand for skilled labor in @entity2 , " he said			1
in other words , @entity2 's boom has created an environment where the demand for high - skilled jobs is now outpacing the growth of @entity2 's educated workforce			1
to meet this challenge , @entity2 will have to ramp up its education efforts even more			2
" immigration is important in the short run			0
we need these workers in @entity2 right now , " he said			0
at the same time , an opposite effect is happening for low - skilled work , @entity66 said			1
the percentage of low - educated @entity2 is decreasing , but the demand for low - skilled labor is decreasing faster , he said			1
@entity66 summed up the way that @entity2 , usually welcoming to immigrants , see this development : " we want to help these low - skilled people , but there is a limit			1
" facing with illegal immigration from @entity26 , @entity2 's @entity106 on @entity90 agreed this month to provide 1,200 work visas per year to @entity26 affected by the 2010 earthquake who emigrate to @entity2			1
the work permits will be good for five years , a period during which the immigrants will find jobs and apply for extensions , or will return home			0
unlike other work visas in @entity2 , applicants need not have a job contract in hand when they arrive			0
under the plan , those immigrants already in the country who entered illegally will be " regularized			0
" unlike the @entity6 , where illegal entry by low - skilled workers is often viewed as a threat , @entity2 are extolling the positives such newly - legalized immigrants can bring			1
" for example , the @entity26 speak @entity134 and could be useful in the cities where the @entity137 games will be held , " labor minister @entity132 dos @entity130 said			0
the country 's justice secretary , @entity138 , is another immigration cheerleader			2
" @entity2 can be an example to the world of an immigration policy that is open and democratic that reflects our historical welcoming tradition , " he said on @entity140 this week			1
he continued : " immigrants add cultural value to @entity2 and collaborate in the development of the nation			0
" in addition to providing visas for the @entity26 , the health department offered 1.3 million reais ( @entity6 $ 745,000 ) for healthcare for them			0
but pleasantries aside , @entity2 has an economy to protect , and the work visas might signify a closing of a door rather than an opening			2
" the attempt to grant visas is an attempt to limit and control the number that come , rather than being generous and open , " said @entity161 , professor emeritus at @entity162 and the author of " @entity164 : @entity2 since 1985			2
" the approach toward immigration by @entity2 and the @entity6 is n't that different after all , he said			2
" both countries want to benefit from advances in technology and both countries want to attract people who are relatively skilled and have an opportunity to contribute to that , " @entity161 said			0
as for low - skilled immigration , there are other forces raising opposition to their entry			1
the @entity26 immigrants are arriving mostly to the western states of @entity184 and @entity185 , in the heart of the @entity188 rain forest			0
a debate of great importance in @entity2 currently is how to protect the @entity188			0
this is the larger issue behind the immigration debate , @entity161 said : will the @entity188 be less protected with an influx of newcomers ? meanwhile , the country 's secretary of strategic affairs has created a team that will propose a new national immigration policy wit emphasis on high - skilled workers			1
one reported proposal would create two " lines " for foreigners applying for work visas in @entity2			0
one for highly - educated applicants , and one for everyone else			0
the coordinator for the project , @entity209 , declined to speak to @entity0 about the commission 's deliberations .			0

@entity2 is experiencing an increase in immigration
it 's economy is attracting both low - and high - skilled labor
the country has been open to immigration , but challenges remain
