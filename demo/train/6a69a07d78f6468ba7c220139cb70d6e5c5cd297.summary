@entity0 -- @entity2 , all drug runners			1
your days of using caltrops to avoid apprehension are over -- at least in @entity7			2
@entity8 -- more commonly known as road spikes -- are small spiky objects like those used in the game of jacks			2
when tossed on roadways , they always point up and have a devastating impact on tires			2
drug runners have increasingly used the devices when fleeing from law enforcement officers , officials say			1
beginning thursday , caltrops are illegal in the @entity7			2
state rep. @entity23 crafted the caltrop ban at the behest of the @entity26 @entity25 , whose tires have borne the caltrops ' trademark slashes			1
" there 's a portion of my district which goes right up to the border , the ( @entity35 ) river , " @entity23 said			2
" and caltrops are used there probably more than any other location in the @entity26			1
" almost all reported cases of caltrop use can be found in a 20 - mile stretch of the border west of @entity45 , @entity7 , authorities said			2
" the first time we were exposed to this was 2008 when we had one incident , " said @entity46 , chief of the @entity25 's @entity47			1
in 2009 , there were 12 incidents , with 13 last year			0
the homemade caltrops found in @entity23 's district probably are made in @entity55			0
typically , they are little nails that are welded together			0
they are cheap , easy to deploy and , @entity23 says , very effective			1
" if you run over a caltrop , your tires will deflate , " he said			0
those that do not puncture the tires of pursuing police cars sometimes puncture the tires of citizens ' cars			0
no one spoke in opposition to the ban at a hearing , @entity23 said			0
@entity46 said while caltrops are effective , the @entity25 has a countermeasure			1
" they ca n't spike our helicopters , " he said			1
but caltrops are hardly a new idea			0
there are numerous references throughout history to caltrops being used to puncture the feet of enemy soldiers or the hooves of their horses			0
the notorious bank robber @entity85 , employing a similar tactic , is alleged to have tossed nails behind his car to defeat pursuing police officers following a heist			0
the @entity85 gang " actually did it several times			0
it became part of their robbery technique , " said @entity93 , author of " @entity85 : the @entity98			0
" the new @entity7 law prohibits the possession , manufacture , transportation , repair or sale of caltrops			1
but it exempts tire puncture strips that are designed to puncture tires when driven in a specific direction , such as those at car rental facilities , and caltrops used as curios , such as those in museums , or on display in @entity23 's office			0
will the ban stop drug runners from using caltrops ? " no , " @entity23 conceded			1
" no , it wo n't			1
but it is a small measure that taken with other small measures will add up to an effective response			1

@entity26 @entity25 *requested* the new law
simple devices known to be *highly* effective
*legislator* who *introduced* measure admits it wo n't stop drug runners
