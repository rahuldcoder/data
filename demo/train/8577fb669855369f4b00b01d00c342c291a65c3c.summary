-- on the night of february 26 , @entity1 was wearing a hoodie and had bought skittles and an @entity5 tea at a convenience store in @entity7 , @entity8			1
some time after that , he was shot and killed by neighborhood watch member @entity10			1
but beyond those established facts about the shooting of the unarmed teenager in an @entity15 suburb last month , much is in dispute about the case that has gripped the nation			2
of the two people directly involved , @entity1 will never be able to describe what happened , and @entity10 has kept mum			1
his lawyer vows that , once all the facts surface , things will not appear as clear - cut as they are to many of @entity1 's supporters at the moment			1
@entity28 will have to wait and see as state attorney @entity29 plunges deeper into a case charged with allegations of racism			2
@entity1 was @entity33 ; @entity10 is a @entity34 who , his family says , has been wrongly described as racist			1
what 's clear is that , as more is learned about this case , it becomes more complicated			1
the little information that has surfaced has been through 911 tapes , what @entity10 told police and the accounts of witnesses who helped paint a picture of the night @entity1 died			1
@entity10 @entity10 was wearing a red jacket and blue jeans when he came across @entity1 on that night			1
he was a neighborhood watch member carrying a @entity51 9 mm pistol , according to a police report			2

he 's coming to check me out			2
he 's got something in his hands			2
" the teenager started to run , @entity10 said			2
a 911 dispatcher asked @entity10 whether he was following @entity1 , and @entity10 said he was			1
the dispatcher said @entity10 did not need to do that			2
@entity10 said he lost sight of @entity1 and began walking back to his suv ; @entity1 approached him , according to the @entity56 account			1
@entity1 asked @entity10 if he had a problem ; @entity10 said no and reached for his cell phone , he told police			1
@entity1 said , " well , you do now " or something similar and punched @entity10 in the nose , @entity10 said , according to the @entity56			1
@entity10 said @entity1 pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk			1
the police report described @entity10 's back as wet and covered with grass , as though he had been lying on the ground			1
@entity10 was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head , the police report said			1
" i was yelling for someone to help me , but no one would help me , " @entity10 told police			1

" there 's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight			0
" @entity10 's call to police was among the 911 tapes released by police			1
some people hear what sounds like a possible racial slur			0
@entity0 enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity0 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether @entity10 used a slur			1
witnesses @entity174 was in her kitchen making coffee that night with her roommate , @entity177			0
the window was open , she said			0
" we heard a whining			0
not like a crying , boohoo , but like a whining , someone in distress , and then the gunshot , " she said			0
they looked out the window but saw nothing			0
they ran out the sliding glass door , and within seconds , they saw @entity10			2
" @entity10 was standing over the body with -- basically straddling the body with his hands on @entity1 's back , " @entity174 said			1
" and it did n't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way			0
i did n't hear any struggle prior to the gunshot			0
" and i feel like it was @entity1 that was crying out , because the minute that the gunshot went off , the whining stopped			2
" the two women said they could not see whether @entity10 was bruised or hurt			2

finally , the third time , he said , ' just call the police			0
' " @entity1 's girlfriend @entity217 , the @entity1 family lawyer , says @entity1 's girlfriend 's account of what happened connects the dots and destroys @entity10 's claims of self - defense			1
the girl , who did not want to be identified , said she was on the phone with the teen before the shooting			0
when @entity10 got closer to @entity1 , she told her boyfriend to run , but @entity1 told her that he was not going to run , she said			1
" what are you stopping me for ? " @entity1 asked @entity10 , according to the girl			1
" what are you doing around here ? " @entity10 asked in response			2
the girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed @entity1 , because the headset fell out of his ear , and the phone shut off			1
@entity10 's friend @entity243 said he spoke with his friend @entity10 on monday			1
he filled @entity243 in on what happened between the time @entity1 came face to face with him and when the gun was fired -- the part that 's not all clear			1
@entity243 said he could not divulge what @entity10 said , just that the gun went off			2
@entity251 , the state attorney , was asked whether that meant the shooting might have been accidental			0

" he cried for days after this happened			0
the @entity10 i know is not here anymore , because he knows that he took someone else 's life , and he 's extremely remorseful			1
" @entity10 has not been charged , sparking a firestorm of protest across @entity28			2
@entity251 's homicide staff , meanwhile , continues to work round the clock .			0
