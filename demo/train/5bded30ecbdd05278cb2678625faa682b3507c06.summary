@entity0 , @entity1 -- from grandma to grandson , from fan to foe , the throngs at @entity0 are happy @entity8 is back in form and ready to contend for a fifth @entity11 title			1
like @entity12 had his army , @entity8 certainly has his troop			1
thousands of patrons lined the fairways on @entity17 's front nine tuesday morning as @entity8 played a practice round			1
they crammed themselves as many as 10 deep around the greens and moved from tee to green like waves going up each side of the fairways			2
" i think he 's going to bring a lot of people back to the game , " said @entity26 , an @entity0 resident who was following @entity27 with his wife and two sons			1
" he 's good for golf			2
" as he spoke , his son @entity35 , 6 , tugged at his father 's pant leg , begging to go to the practice tee to wait in line for @entity8 ' autograph			1
" he 's very special , " @entity35 squeaked about his favorite golf star			2
woods scored his first official @entity44 victory in two and a half years two weeks ago , winning the @entity45 at @entity46 in @entity47 by five strokes			1
it was also his first victory since disclosure of his marital infidelities , which led to divorce			2
in the months between those wins , his game nosedived and he plummeted from the top spot in the world golf rankings , even falling out of the top 50			0
he 's rebounded to no. 7 and rebounded with the fans , too			2
@entity59 , a 60 - year - old from @entity60 , @entity61 , was pleased to see @entity8 back in the winner 's column			1
" he showed all the doubters that he still had a game , " @entity26 said			0
@entity67 : @entity8 shows this is his masters to lose some never were doubters , including @entity70 , a native of @entity72 who moved to @entity73 26 years ago and now lives in @entity74			1
i 'm obsessed with him , " said @entity75 , who also goes by @entity76 for those who ca n't pronounce his name			0
he said his goal is to play with @entity27 one day			0
@entity75 , a former rugby player , said watching @entity27 -- and a nasty knee injury -- inspired him to take up golf four years ago			1
he 's down to a six handicap , he said , and has won local tournaments , but he 'll just be watching @entity8 from the other side of the ropes at @entity0			1
" i got a date with @entity8			1
i 'll see ya ! " he said tuesday morning , scampering down the ninth fairway in search of his idol			0
@entity92 of @entity93 , @entity47 , also had a date with @entity8 on tuesday morning , but do n't count him among @entity8 ' fans			1
that 's because @entity8 does n't respect the fans , he said , adding the golf star had done little to acknowledge their cheers in tuesday morning 's practice round			1
" without the fans , where are you ? " @entity92 asked			2
so why was he making the trek around @entity0 's back nine for a meaningless round on a gray tuesday morning ? " the wife loves him , " he said			1
he looked over to the ropes where his wife , @entity108 , followed @entity27 as he walked up to the sixth green			0
" she 's in love with him ! " for himself , @entity92 said , he 'd rather be following @entity114			0
" and you know why ? because he interacts with the fans , " @entity92 said			2
do n't tell the kids @entity8 does n't interact			1
up by the practice green , they squeezed against the railings of the junior autograph area , hoping to get @entity8 to sign whatever they had handy			1
@entity123 : most - anticipated masters in years @entity125 , a 13 - year - old from @entity126 , @entity127 , scored @entity8 's signature on his flag			1
" it was really cool being up close to him , " said @entity125 , who waited 90 minutes in the autograph area			0
woods and the other masters participants have been examples for his own game , @entity125 said			0
" i try to make my swing like all those pros , " the young golfer said			0
and maybe watching @entity27 is something that will inspire new generations of players to take the game to new levels			0
@entity145 of @entity146 , @entity147 , said she thinks there 's something to that argument			0
" @entity8 makes these young kids what they are today , " said @entity151 , noting that @entity8 athleticism and conditioning regimen has set the standard for others and elevated the game as a whole			1
@entity151 said @entity8 has inspired her 13 - year - old grandson			1
" he 's obsessed with @entity8 , " she said			1
" he says , ' i want to play in the masters			0
' " @entity8 has elevated more than just the sport , said @entity165 , a retired @entity166 colonel from @entity167 , @entity168			1
that 's because if @entity8 is bringing people out to @entity44 events , the charities that golf supports are able to do more for those they serve			1
" think about the revenue created for the charities , " @entity165 said			0
" it 's he , and he alone , who does that			0
" out along @entity181 , the main route from @entity183 to the course , @entity8 ' resurgence is having another kind of economic effect			2
those who came to @entity0 without tickets are paying more to buy passes from the roadside brokers			2
@entity191 of @entity192 , @entity193 , his brother and a friend lucked into two passes at face value from a passing motorist , @entity191 said			0
but they still needed a third and had n't found anything under $ 350 at noon tuesday			0
" we 're not going to pay $ 350 , " he said			0
" the ticket price has spiked up , " said @entity203 , who said he 's been trading tickets on @entity205 for the past 30 years			2
he had sold passes for tuesday 's practice round for $ 250 , he said , but was looking for new inventory at lunchtime			0
for sunday 's final round , they 'll be around $ 500 -- and they 'd be higher , he said , but the fact that sunday is @entity215 is keeping the price dampened a bit			0
of course , that @entity219 deduction may well be eliminated if @entity8 is atop the leaderboard on saturday night			2
" i could n't say i 'm pulling for him to win			0
it just makes golf more interesting , " said @entity222 of @entity223 , @entity61 , who was watching for @entity27 with his brother and father			0
" @entity229 is way better with @entity8 , " said @entity125 's father , @entity228			2
" whether you love him or hate him , the sport needs him			0

@entity8 is contending for his fifth @entity11 title
he scored his first official @entity44 victory in two and a half years two weeks ago
fans are hoping to witness a @entity8 *comeback* in @entity0
