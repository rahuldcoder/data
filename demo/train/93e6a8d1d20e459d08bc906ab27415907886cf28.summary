-- a broad coalition of groups supporting everything from religion , drugs , and digital rights to guns and the environment sued the @entity9 today , demanding a federal judge immediately halt what they are calling an " unconstitutional program of dragnet electronic surveillance " stemming from the government 's vast collection of @entity17 ' phone - calling data			1
pdf ) , lodged in @entity21 federal court , is at least the fourth challenging the government 's wholesale phone surveillance program first disclosed by the @entity25 newspaper , which last month began publishing documents leaked to the media outlet by former @entity9 contractor @entity28			1
lawmakers at first appeared outraged by the disclosure and held hearings			0
but that fervor had quickly dissipated , and @entity34 has seemingly turned a blind eye to the surveillance that all the lawsuits — from @entity21 to the @entity38 — seek to halt			2
" @entity45 ' collection of telephone communications information includes , but is not limited to , recordings indicating who each customer communicates with , at what time , for how long and with what frequency communications occur			0
this communications information discloses the expressive and private associational connections among individuals and groups , including @entity51 and their members and staff , " according to the suit , which is being ligated by the @entity55 and others			2
" this lawsuit challenges an illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet electronic surveillance , specifically the bulk acquisition , collection , storage , retention , and searching of telephone communications information , " the suit said			1
the @entity25 in june posted a leaked copy of a top secret @entity75 opinion requiring @entity76 to provide the @entity9 the phone numbers of both parties involved in all calls , the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) number for mobile callers , calling card numbers used in the call , and the time and duration of the calls			2
the law that has been authorizing the surveillance is the @entity82 — adopted six weeks after the 2001 terror attacks — and greatly expanded the government 's power to intrude into the private lives of @entity17			1
the suit names one of the most controversial provisions of the @entity82 — section 215 — that allows the secret @entity75 to authorize broad warrants for most any type of records , including those held by banks , doctors and phone companies			2
lawmakers have repeatedly voted to prevent the act from expiring			0
the government only needs to show that the information is " relevant " to an authorized investigation			0
no connection to a terrorist or spy is required			0
the suit says the spying as outlined by the @entity25 and confirmed by the government breaches the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs			1
among other things , it chills their @entity114 speech rights and breaches the @entity115 because the secret court is authorizing the surveillance against @entity17 without particularized suspicion that they have engaged in any criminal , terrorist activity			1
" the program collects information concerning all calls wholly within the @entity17 , including local telephone calls , as well as all calls between the @entity17 and abroad , regardless of a connection to international terrorism , reasonable suspicion of criminality , or any other form of wrongdoing , " according to the suit , signed by @entity131 , the @entity55 's legal director			1
the suit names the @entity9 ; @entity9 director @entity133 , attorney general @entity134 ; @entity135 ; fbi director @entity136 ; and director of national intelligence @entity137 and others			2
the plaintiffs include : @entity141 of @entity142 ; @entity143 ; @entity144 ; @entity145 ; council on @entity147 ; @entity148 ; @entity149 ; @entity150 ; @entity151 ; @entity152 ; @entity153 ; @entity154 ; @entity155 ; @entity156 , @entity157 ; @entity158 ; @entity159 ; and @entity160			1
the government has repeatedly maintained that @entity17 have no constitutional privacy rights connected to their business records with the phone company			0
meantime , the @entity165 has taken a different legal path and has asked the @entity167 to stop the program under virtually the same allegations			0
the @entity170 has done the same in a @entity173 federal court			0
@entity174 , the former chairman of @entity175 , has lodged a suit challenging the surveillance in a district of @entity180 federal court			1
the government has yet to officially answer the allegations in court , but is expected to respond later this week in the @entity170 challenge			0
