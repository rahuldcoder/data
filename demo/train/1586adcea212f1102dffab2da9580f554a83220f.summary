@entity9 is charged with murder in the death of dr. @entity12 , who was shot to death may 31 in his church in @entity15 , @entity16			1
prosecutor @entity17 urged jurors to convict @entity9 , reminding the jury of the defendant 's testimony thursday			2
" his testimony was delivered very matter - of - factly , but its contents were chillingly horrific , " she said			0
" he carried out a planned assassination , and there can be no other verdict in this case ... other than guilty			0
" @entity30 , chief deputy district attorney , told the jurors that @entity9 's actions were unjustified and cowardly			1
" @entity9 is not justified , " she said			0
" he is only and simply guilty of the crimes he is charged with			0
" @entity35 , a defense attorney for @entity9 , told jurors that @entity9 believed he had to act			1
" @entity9 thought that the babies kept on dying , " he said			2
" @entity9 formed a belief that he had to stop @entity12 from killing more babies			1
" he admitted that @entity9 killed @entity12 but said only the jurors can decide if @entity9 " murdered " @entity12			1
he said he was not asking jurors " to check your common sense at the door " and urged them to " represent our little part of the nation well			0
" " no defendant should ever be convicted based on his convictions , " @entity35 said			0
@entity9 testified thursday that he shot and killed @entity12 and did not regret it			1
" there was nothing being done , and the legal process had been exhausted , and these babies were dying every day , " @entity9 said			0
" i felt that if someone did not do something , he was going to continue			0
" @entity12 ran a women 's clinic at which he performed abortions			1
@entity62 district judge @entity61 ruled after the end of testimony thursday that the jury could not consider a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter against @entity9 as the defense wanted			2
in making the ruling , @entity61 noted that @entity9 had been talking about killing @entity12 for 10 years , @entity0 affiliate @entity69 reported			1
several of @entity12 's family members broke into tears as @entity9 recounted the shooting			1
@entity9 said he did n't regret what he did and felt " a sense of relief " when he learned that @entity12 's clinic was shut down after his death			1
@entity9 calmly testified that he thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into his , perhaps , or shooting him with a rifle			1
he also considered cutting @entity12 's hands off with a sword , but decided that would not be effective , as @entity12 would still be able to train others			2
@entity12 , 67 , was one of the few @entity88 doctors who performed late - term abortion procedures			2
he had already survived one attempt on his life before he was killed			0
he decided to kill @entity12 at his church , he said , because " i felt that actually if he was to be stopped , that was probably the only place he could have been stopped			1
... it was the only window of opportunity i saw			0
" @entity9 said he visited the church four or five times before @entity12 's death			1
the week before the shooting , on may 24 , he carried a .22 - caliber handgun with him , he testified , but @entity12 did not attend church that day			2
on may 31 , though , the doctor was there , and " i did what i thought was needed to be done to protect the children , " @entity9 said			0
" " the lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop @entity12 , " he said			0
the defense had sought to have former @entity16 attorney general @entity111 and current deputy attorney general @entity112 testify , but the judge did not allow it			2
@entity111 unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute @entity12 in 2006 , and @entity112 charged @entity12 with 19 misdemeanor counts , but a jury acquitted him			0
@entity61 said @entity9 could testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs , but to allow testimony from @entity111 would " get into legal matters that do not concern this jury			0
" and , the judge said , the cases do not give @entity9 a basis to state absolutely that @entity12 's actions were illegal , since the doctor had never been convicted			1
defense attorneys claim @entity9 was led to shoot @entity12 in part because of authorities ' failure to punish him through the judicial system			2
@entity9 testified he was " very frustrated " by @entity12 's acquittal , saying it " seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of @entity16 to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in @entity12 's clinic			1
" @entity9 could face life in prison if convicted of first - degree murder			0
he also is charged with two counts of aggravated assault for allegedly pointing his gun at two other ushers as he fled the church .			0
