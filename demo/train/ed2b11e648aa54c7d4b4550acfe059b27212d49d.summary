working inside @entity0 presents various challenges as a photojournalist			1
one of them is working directly with rebel forces defending one of their last bastions against government forces			2
each day their defensive perimeter shrinks due to constant shelling			0
journalists need to acquire proper accreditation given and approved by the @entity13			0
the funeral series of photos is both rare and hard to come by , as the rebels typically do n't give access to the kind of events which show their military losses			1
if you 're a reporter or anybody from the press you have to apply to get two different id cards from the rebels			2
one is more general ; it allows you to go through checkpoints			0
it 's like an official accreditation			0
the second one is supposed to allow you to photograph military areas -- although in practice it 's up to the discretion of the local military commander and usually they 're friendly but they 'll say ' no. ' we suspect the document is also a good way to control us and the info we provide to the world , by checking the internet			0
this accreditation also carries another risk -- if you 're in @entity46 - controlled areas and they see that , they 'll probably arrest you ... because it 's official documentation from the " @entity13			1
" nonetheless , we have both , so every time we go through checkpoints , the rebels check our car and they ask for our accreditation and we show them these documents and they let us through			2
in this case , while driving with our fixer on the road we passed a convoy of rebel cars and two armored vehicles each carrying troops and two coffins			1
we decided to follow it and try our luck			2
after a mile , a car from the convoy stopped us , pointed its machine gun at us and asked why we were following them			2
we explained to them that we wanted to follow the funeral			1
for some reason they agreed			0
we drove another 20 minutes to a small village on the front lines - you could hear the constant shelling as government forces were nearby			0
for an hour we photographed the entire ceremony , only to be arrested as it ended under the pretext that the rebel 's faces were shown and some lived nearby			1
they put us in different cars , drove us to their headquarters in @entity0 , and forced us to delete all the photos			1
but back at the hotel we managed to retrieve all of them			0
there are unique moments -- it was very personal for them , they were crying			0
see more of @entity101 's photos of @entity0 and read about the siege of the city .			1
