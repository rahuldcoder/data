four geisha , wrapped in kimonos under dark winter coats , walk in single file through a snow - covered forest			2
their red and orange parasols a burst of color against the winter monochrome			0
it could be a scene from a print by 19th century @entity15 artist @entity14 , but behind the evocative image is a modern story			1
leading the four through the snows of @entity19 , the ski resort on the northern island of @entity22 , is @entity23			1
she 's an @entity24 citizen who first moved to @entity15 when she was just 15 and in 2007 became a geisha			1
now working and living as @entity23 , she offers those intrigued by the geisha tradition a glimpse into their enigmatic world by hosting banquets and offering visitors the chance to watch them practice their arts			1
her initial fascination with geisha came when working as a filmmaker pitching a documentary on the subject			2
she eschewed the detachment gained through a camera lens , claiming that only by becoming one herself could she really get to know their traditions and skills			0
" i could n't just take one step into it , i had to totally embrace it , it was the only way , " she says			2
" the geisha world is aesthetically very beautiful and with a very beautiful lifestyle , " she says explaining what first attracted her to a very different life			2
" but , really , to live a beautiful life in any country is not so easy , " she adds hinting at the challenges she faced becoming one of the few western women to live as a geisha in @entity15			1
an experience unchanged for 400 years for most visitors to @entity15 attracted by the mystery of the geisha industry , @entity23 's tours may be as close as they will get to experience an authentic geisha experience			1
an evening 's entertainment at a banquet consists of a multi-course meal with interludes for dances , singing or music played on traditional instruments like the shamisen , a three - stringed lute , or yokobue , a traditional @entity15 flute			1
traditionally , geisha would specialize in one art form and spend their careers improving their craft			2
aside from a few 21st century additions like an @entity82 accompaniment to the dancing , @entity23 says that the scene at one of her hosted dinners would not have changed much for 400 years			1
" if you come to a banquet you get to experience the most beautiful parts of @entity15 culture , the best of @entity15 cuisine			1
there really is no other way to experience it all in one space			0
" while @entity19 is something of frontier in the country for geisha culture , the rest of the year @entity23 is based in @entity99 's @entity98 district and also travels to host geisha banquets abroad			1
a tradition cloaked in mystery for centuries geishas have worked as entertainers and paid companions			0
the most literal translation of geisha is simply " artist			2
" different districts in @entity15 cities have varying training regimen for geisha , but typically , as in @entity118 , exams are taken after the first year as an apprentice , with four additional years of @entity120 many operate within geisha houses -- academies for trainee geisha -- that help manage their careers , while also providing a unique bond and atmosphere of sisterhood			1
with each delicately crafted kimono costing thousands of dollars ( traditionally each geisha would need a wardrobe of 36 to reflect changing seasons ) , being affiliated with a geisha house helps trainee geisha ( called maiko in @entity118 , hangyoku in @entity99 ) absorb the costs			0
after a year 's training at a geisha house in @entity99 's @entity98 district @entity23 now operates as an independent			1
she says she was denied the chance to take on the position of " geisha mother " and mentor young geisha affiliated with the geisha house she trained with because she is not @entity15			1
along with @entity118 , the @entity98 district has a long tradition of geisha , enabling visitors today to easily indulge in some geisha - spotting ( particularly the ancient @entity152 area of @entity118 ) as they walk through streets on the way to functions at local teahouses and restaurants			0
commercialization : against geisha 's nature it 's become something of a tourist pastime in @entity118			0
there are now organized walking tours , something that many within in the community have criticized as being too intrusive			0
for some the commercialization of geisha culture goes against its very nature			0
" exclusivity is part of the deal with geishas , " says author @entity171 who spent six months living in @entity118 's geisha district while researching her book , " @entity174 : the remarkable truth behind the fiction			0
" " people want to commercialize it , but as a tourist you wo n't see the pristine experience , you 'll get an experience , but it just wo n't be the same			0
" " i think those that work in the geisha industry are very good at hiding ( the world from outsiders )			0
" for @entity171 , geisha remain the embodiment of refinement and grace and are still the custodians of the traditional @entity15 art forms			1
and far from being painted courtesans , their role as artists and professional companions makes them rather formidable , believes @entity171			0
" these are really impressive women			0
walking down the street with them i felt really proud			0
" @entity23 's tour ; +81 90 6046 9708 ; from jpy30 , 000 ( $ 250 )			2

*hoping* to make a documentary about geisha , @entity24 @entity23 ended up becoming one
apart from using an @entity82 to accompany her dancing , a geisha banquet has n't changed much in the past 400 years
different districts in @entity15 cities have varying training regimen for geisha
