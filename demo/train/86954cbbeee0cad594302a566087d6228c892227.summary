-- in @entity2 smoke billows on the street from burning tires and protesters use fire extinguishers to shoot iron arrows towards riot police			1
but at the @entity10 it is business as usual as the roar of @entity13 continues to fill the @entity15 track in the kingdom			1
even so , friday 's practice session for sunday 's @entity18 was overshadowed by political tensions as the sport 's regulator and teams insisted the race should go ahead			1
@entity2 's @entity25 opposition was said to be planning protests on friday , though it was unclear if the police would allow them to go ahead			1
on thursday , thousands demonstrated in several areas across @entity2 in yet another day of protests			1
but with no evidence of unrest in and around the track , the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) -- the sport 's regulator -- and @entity34 ( @entity34 ) -- the commercial rights holders for the sport -- insisted the race will take place			1
" the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) and @entity34 ( @entity34 ) wish to jointly confirm their belief that the @entity45 should go ahead this weekend , " those two bodies said in a statement			1
" the @entity31 and @entity34 also strongly believe that sport can often be a force for good and that the staging of the @entity18 in @entity2 will come some way in helping soothe some of the issues which have been raised in the media			1
" @entity52 and @entity53 are united in expressing their support for the @entity45 and the national organizer , and wish that all concerned respect the desire of the teams , drivers and all those involved in the staging of the event to do the best job possible over the weekend , " added the statement , referring respectively to the @entity31 president and the @entity13 supremo			1
" the local promoter and the national authorities have assured both the @entity31 and @entity34 that security , their responsibility , will be guaranteed for all participants to the @entity45			1
" tensions in the kingdom remain high following the 2011 uprising , where the majority @entity25 population protested against the ruling @entity79 minority			1
those protests were brought to a swift and brutal conclusion by @entity2 's security forces along with the assistance of troops brought in from @entity85			1
while protesters have used the grand prix as an opportunity to bring global attention to their struggle , the @entity2 government insists the race will bring long term benefits to its people			1
" @entity13 brings significant benefits to everyone in @entity2 , especially economically , " the government said in a statement			1
" @entity2 upholds the right to peaceful protest			2
it is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development			2
" this is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way			2
" it should be noted that in some cases protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence			0
" only in these case do security forces respond and they do so while exercising appropriate restraint			0
some unfortunately believe that continued unrest on the streets affords them a political advantage , when it results in greater divisions between communities in @entity2			2
violence can never be tolerated			0
" meanwhile , on the track , @entity122 was the fastest man in the afternoon 's second free practice session			1
the @entity126 driver clocked a fastest time of one minute 34.154 seconds to pip @entity128 's @entity127 by just 0.03 seconds			2
" i would have liked to have got some more running in @entity131 , but i still think we learned what we expected today , " @entity129 told the official @entity34 website			2
" saturdays are perhaps becoming less important overall than they used to be , but they 're still important in terms of traffic			0
" you do n't want to be in too much traffic on sunday , as the tires do n't like being disturbed and wear more which will shorten your first stint -- so you still need to be in a good position			2
" we still have areas to improve on the car			0
@entity126 and @entity145 look strong and @entity146 is there too			0
" @entity128 rival and three - time world champion @entity148 was third fastest in the afternoon , but he remains positive of his chances of success this weekend			2
" it 's pretty close , " said @entity148			0
" if you look at the opposition then @entity145 and @entity126 were strong today and i think it will be close in qualifying			0
" it 's important to work with the tires around the track			0
i was n't so happy with my short runs today - but that 's why we have the friday practice sessions i guess ; i was happier with the longer runs			1
" the tires still seem to be the dominating factor			0
the car seems quick , so we have to make sure we use that and then we should be on the right page			0
" @entity170 , who has recorded two podium finishes so far this season , found life more difficult after finishing the day 10th fastest			0
" we 're working as hard as we can and we just need to find some more time from somewhere , " he told reporters			0
" i do n't really know where we are losing it			0
they have changed the car this weekend , changed the settings for what they think the track needs but i 'm not convinced it is the right way to go			0
" i do n't know if they are right or wrong but we were struggling for pace today ... but i am sure we will find it			0
