@entity0 made an unusual request in her will before she died last month in @entity2 , @entity3 : she asked that her @entity5 shepherd , @entity4 , be euthanized and buried with her			1
three weeks later , however , @entity4 , who is 9 years old and male , is healthy and very much alive			1
and there 's a growing movement on social media to defy his late owner 's wishes and spare the animal			2
@entity0 's attorney , @entity13 , told @entity15 affiliate @entity14 that his late client preferred to send @entity4 to @entity18 's no - kill sanctuary in southern @entity19 to live out the remainder of his days			1
but if transporting the dog across the country proved too expensive , @entity0 wanted a close friend to take charge of @entity4 and carry out her request that " the dog be put to sleep , cremated and that the dog 's ashes be placed with her own ashes			1
" as it turned out , sending @entity4 to the @entity19 animal sanctuary was not financially feasible , @entity13 told @entity34 , another @entity15 affiliate			1
but following a public outcry , a decision about the dog 's fate has been put on hold for now , he said			2
@entity4 was with @entity0 when she died at home november 25			1
the dog is now being housed in a special kennel at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity3			1
director @entity45 said the center has no legal control over the dog 's future and is waiting to hear from @entity0 's attorney			2
" he 's been cared for very well , " @entity45 told @entity15 on thursday			0
" we 're happy to have him here as long as need be			0
he has toys and blankies and he 's just chilling			0
" meanwhile , animal lovers on @entity59 and @entity60 are urging that @entity4 be spared , calling @entity0 's decision selfish			1
supporters have mounted an online petition to save the dog and are rallying around a # @entity66 hashtag			1
" add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt @entity4 and give her a happy home			2
please # @entity66 from her dead owner 's stupidity , " one woman wrote			1
@entity18 also has weighed in , posting a statement on its @entity59 page urging fans to share # @entity66 messages			1
" we want to save @entity4 's life and bring him to our sanctuary , but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands , " said the post			2
" the decision needs to be made by the person designated in ms. @entity0 's will and we are hopeful that she will agree			0
" @entity89 maintains that everything about @entity0 's request is legal			0
" the dog was owned by my client and now it 's part of her estate , " he told @entity14			2
" and those are her wishes , as far as the future of the dog is concerned			0
outsiders do n't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client 's will and impose what they want			0
" @entity13 said @entity0 did n't trust @entity4 to be around others and the 105 - pound dog has a history of aggressive behavior			1
he told @entity14 that a veterinarian recommended @entity4 be put down			2
" he could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers , in particular , children			0
" the case has raised ethical questions about how much control deceased people should have over the life of their pets			0
" on the whole , we do n't allow people to euthanize healthy pets , " said @entity122 , a professor of ethics at @entity124			0
on the other hand , he said , it 's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized			0
" as a matter of policy , do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim ? " he pondered			0
" assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for , i 'm not sure we want to encourage this			0

a deceased @entity3 woman asked in her will that her pet dog be euthanized
three weeks after her death the dog , @entity4 , remains alive
animal lovers have started a # @entity66 hashtag on @entity60
