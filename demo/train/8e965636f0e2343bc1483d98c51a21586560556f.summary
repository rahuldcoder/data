-- @entity1 does n't yet swing in the transporting , ruefully tender coming - of - age drama " @entity4			1
" @entity5 and @entity6 star as a couple in " @entity4			1
" it 's 1961 , and @entity9 ( @entity5 ) , a bright 16 - year - old schoolgirl in a tidy @entity11 suburb , nurtures aspirations of sophistication that involve smoking cigarettes and dreaming of the day she can sit in a @entity16 cafe			1
@entity18 - era grooviness and sexual liberation have n't yet reached this corner of the @entity21 , where cautious , 1950s - style postwar provincialism still prevails -- the same squareness the gents across the pond in " @entity26 " are just beginning to bend			2
@entity9 's dad ( @entity27 ) is fearful and fussy ; @entity28 ( @entity29 ) is resigned			0
so the good student studies her @entity31 , grinding for admisson into @entity33			2
life lessons do n't begin until she meets @entity35 ( @entity6 ) , who 's in his early 30s , and @entity36 , and suave			1
he 's so charmant , he even dazzles @entity28 and @entity37			0
being included in @entity35 's exotic , if mysteriously shady , universe -- the travel , the jazz clubs that hint at wider horizons , and , oh yes , the sex -- is like a crash course in worldliness			0
and as this picture of times that were a-changin ' demonstrates with quiet , though conventionally built , artistry , worldliness has its discontents			0
" @entity4 " is the vivid story of how one girl became a woman -- and how @entity53 @entity1 morphed into the youthquake center of ' 60s yeah yeah yeah			1
none of which would be quite so vivid without the beguiling performance of newcomer @entity58			0
she 's very much an it girl , with her natural elegance in a brunet upsweep Ã  la @entity62			2
and she 's protectively partnered by @entity6 in the tricky job of playing sweet yet suspect , a balance he sustains with nonchalance			1
equally important players : @entity68 and the divine @entity69 as @entity35 's ever - so - knowing pals , @entity71 as a teacher who hates to see her prize pupil make poor choices , and @entity75 , steaming forth like a battleship as @entity9 's headmistress			1
the movie , in a palette of cloudy blues , is adapted from a vivid memoir by @entity83 journalist @entity82 and directed by gifted @entity85 filmmaker @entity84 from a screenplay of economical empathy by " @entity89 " novelist @entity88			2
afterward , you 'll want to listen to the @entity18 sing " @entity91			0
" it might be a girl like @entity9 the lads had in mind			0
