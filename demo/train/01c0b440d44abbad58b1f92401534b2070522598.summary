in june of 1960 , my father was a 14 - year - old @entity3 boy with a round - trip airline ticket from @entity5 to @entity6 , @entity7			1
he spent the summer with family in @entity7 while @entity3 fell deeper and deeper into @entity10 's revolution			1
he did n't realize the extent to which his life back home was quickly crumbling and that the winds of revolution were about to change his life forever			2
at the end of that summer , my grandfather told his son that he would not be coming home ; that he should stay in @entity7 and wait for the rest of the family to join him			0
it was a long wait			0
it would take my grandfather more than 10 years to get out of @entity3			2
i 've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my grandfather 's plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in socialist @entity3			1
maybe if my father had known he was n't coming back home , he would have put up a fight to stay in @entity5			0
my mother recently found that unused airline ticket sitting in a box of my father 's things			0
the ticket to a flight that never happened is a heartbreaking slice of family history still frozen in time			0
for many @entity43 , the reaction to the news that the @entity43 and @entity3 have announced plans to normalize relations was , " it 's about time			1
" for many @entity43 , @entity3 is nothing more than a forbidden playground with cigars , rum , beautiful beaches and baseball players			1
they want to experience a taste of this island trapped in time			0
they want to see the classic @entity43 cars rolling through the streets of @entity5			2
to the families of @entity3 exiles , the island is much more			1
it 's a complex and sad reality			0
@entity3 is not a novelty or an unchecked box on a bucket list			2
@entity3 is the rhythmic heartbeat of a life lost long ago but still beating in our souls			2
@entity10 's revolution split my family apart like so many others			2
i still have extended family in @entity3			2
i 've had only a few chances to spend time with them			0
( i 've worked as a journalist twice in @entity3 , covering @entity77 's visit in 1998 and former president @entity79 's visit in 2002			1
) i 'm the only person in my family who has traveled to @entity3 since most of my family left			2
all my life , i 've wondered if this historic moment would ever come in my lifetime			0
in my mind , it was supposed to be a moment like the @entity87 coming down ; a highly anticipated event the world would watch together			0
but instead , the news seemed to come out of thin air on the week before @entity92			0
unexpected and unpredictable , that 's the way it always seems to be with @entity3			1
hard times for ordinary @entity3 with normalized relations , many people want to see a boom of foreign investment , led by @entity43 flocking to a place that 's been locked behind the gates of the @entity102 for more than 50 years			1
but i ask you to understand , as best as i can explain , the fear and apprehension this news means to many @entity3 exiles			1
people often tell me that they 'd love to travel to @entity3 because it seems like such a fun place			2
i tell them of my uncle who , well into his old age , would wake up at 4 in the morning to get in line for a ration of bread			0
i remember the first time i visited @entity3 , i watched my uncle come home with a piece of bread that had more in common with a hockey puck			0
i could n't believe that my elderly uncle would wake up every morning to stand in line for that			0
people often tell me they want to walk the streets of @entity5 and see the crumbling buildings			0
i tell them of the countless young girls who work as " jineteras " -- slang for @entity3 prostitutes -- to help earn money for their families who live crammed inside those walls			1
it 's sickening to think that so many men from around the world come to @entity3 for just this reason			1
these are the kinds of things @entity3 exile families think about when they think of @entity3			1
there 's a very privileged class in @entity3			2
the families of those in power live a life that rivals that of the most comfortable @entity43			2
so when @entity3 exiles hear of normalizing relations , they worry that it 's @entity3 's privileged class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary @entity3			1
fear that the status quo will prevail many @entity3 exiles feel that the @entity10 regime has won the war for more than 50 years and that normalizing relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship			1
" they always win " is a common sentiment among @entity3 exiles who have such a distrust of the @entity10 regime			1
many exiles fear a wrong move will provide another victory for a dictatorship that took so much from them			1
for more than 50 years , @entity3 's story has surprised and saddened many exiles and their families , and we ca n't help but fear history will repeat itself			1
we see family and friends left behind on the island who 've spent decades fighting and scraping for the most meager of lives			0
" no es facil , " said president @entity176 , the @entity178 phrase often used to describe life in @entity3			0
it translates to life " is not easy			0
" and that 's putting it mildly			0
perhaps it 's inevitable that @entity43 and other foreign investment will swoop into @entity3 one day			1
maybe it 's just a matter of time before a @entity190 's restaurant sits on the @entity191 , @entity5 's famous oceanfront boulevard just 90 miles from @entity192			0
or maybe @entity43 will rush in to buy up oceanfront property with amazing views on the most beautiful beaches of @entity3			1
but i ask you this : what kind of view will ordinary @entity3 get ? my father did n't live long enough to see this moment			1
my grandparents are n't here to see it either			0
and most in my family have mixed emotions about what this will really mean			0
this @entity92 , we 'll argue about it over black beans and rice and roasted pork			0
the children of @entity3 exiles , like me , all dream of walking the streets of @entity3 with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that rhythmic beat of our @entity3 soul that still sits in our hearts .			1

many @entity43 see @entity3 as a playground of cigars , rum , beautiful beaches and baseball
but the @entity3 revolution broke up families , and there 's a *big* gap between nation 's rich and poor
some fear that any foreign investment in @entity3 wo n't benefit ordinary @entity3
many exiles feel that normalizing relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship
