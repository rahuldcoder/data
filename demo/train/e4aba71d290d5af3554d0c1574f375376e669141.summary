@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister on saturday gave security forces the ok to use " all measures " at their disposal to find and free three teenagers believed kidnapped in an area of @entity10 settlements in the @entity11			1
the teens have been missing since late thursday or friday , having last been seen around @entity14 , according to @entity15			0
" ( they were ) kidnapped by a terror organization , there is no doubt about that , " prime minister @entity16 said in a nationally televised address saturday			0
while it was n't clear which group is behind the alleged abductions , @entity16 stated explicitly that " it is the responsibility " of the @entity27 to do something about the teens			1
to that point , @entity16 said he 's asked the @entity27 president @entity31 " to do everything to help bring them back in peace			1
" @entity16 said he 's given security force leaders orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to @entity37 or any other place			1
already , dozens of @entity40 have been arrested in the southern part of the @entity11 in connection with the search , and @entity3 forces have been reinforced by a paratroop brigade , an @entity3 military source said earlier saturday			1
the official @entity27 news agency @entity46 reported at least 12 people had been arrested in @entity11			1
the @entity15 is looking at all scenarios as it seeks to identify who is behind the believed kidnapping , and it has not ruled out the possibility that the perpetrators will try to reach @entity37 , the source said			0
there is ongoing security coordination with the @entity27 security services , who understand that this " is not just some terror attack			2
it has substantial meaning to us , " the source said			0
a burned - out car is being examined for any possible connection to the teens ' disappearance			0
the deployment of military assets to search for the teens , and the swift presumption of kidnapping , are a reflection of the tensions that exist between @entity10 settlers and @entity40 in the @entity11			2
the expansion of @entity10 settlements in the @entity11 has been a lasting point of contention in the region			0
it has altered the map of the @entity27 territories , making it more difficult to draw a contiguous @entity27 state as part of any peace agreement , according to critics			0
the highly contentious issue of @entity3 construction in the @entity11 and @entity0 , which the @entity40 seek for a future state , has hurt peace efforts .			2
