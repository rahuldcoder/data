-- @entity1 , better known as " @entity2 " on " @entity3 , " is a @entity4 veteran			1
well known for being open with fans and the life of the @entity4 party , @entity1 made a pit - stop at @entity0 to answer some of our bsg - fan questions			1
@entity0 : had you seen the original @entity3 before taking the role ? @entity1 : absolutely , i grew up on the original @entity3 , i grew up on " @entity14			1
" the great thing about " @entity3 " was that it was basically " @entity14 " but once a week , as opposed to waiting for three years for the movie to come out			1
i was a huge " @entity3 " fan			1
@entity0 : tell us about when you first auditioned for " @entity3 " -- was it for the part of capt. @entity2 ? @entity1 : no , no i originally auditioned for the part of @entity22 ( capt. @entity22 ) which @entity23 got , which is good because @entity23 has to go to the gym and i never did			1
that was good for me			1
and my callback was for [ the role of ] lt. @entity29 , which went to @entity30 , who 's great			1
he 's a great actor and he can do the tech talk really well			2
when they got to the end of the casting there was just no one for the chief , this @entity2 character that they had left , and @entity41 [ one of the creators of the show ] said , " why do n't we get @entity1 to do this ? " because @entity41 had seen my auditions and quite liked me			1
so , they offered me this and it grew into what it was			2
@entity0 : at what point did you find out that your character was a cylon ? [ a robot ] @entity1 : officially , the day before we started shooting it			1
but we shot that scene in december , and i had seen some papers that i was n't supposed to see over at [ director ] @entity64 's house , in september			2
so i had to sit very quietly for three months , not say a word , furious the whole time			2
and constantly walking past @entity67 and @entity41 , who are the creators of the show , and say , " so , anything coming up for the chief ? " and they 'd say , " oh no , just fixing vipers , just the usual			2
" just lying to me ! so we finally found out officially and i got @entity67 [ @entity67 ] on the phone , yelled at him for five minutes and then he talked me off the ledge and convinced me that it was a good thing , and he was right			1
@entity0 : did you suspect that you might be one of the @entity79 ? @entity1 : @entity80 , no. absolutely not			1
i thought that the great thing about the @entity2 character is he 's such a human , and i guess if they want to humanize the @entity79 there 's no better character to do it than him and @entity87 , but i did not see it coming			1
i thought it was going to be new people revealed , i did n't think that it was going to be cast revealed to be			2
@entity0 : did you draw inspiration for your own character from having watched the original @entity3 ? @entity1 : no , my character was n't in the original @entity3 , and i do n't really know how i do what i do			1
i literally , i just show up and i say the words as simply as i can			2
i have a new show now called " @entity99 , " where i play a guy who 's a real - life guy			2
my character 's based on the life of a guy named @entity104 who was a cop for 12 years and then became head of the police association , so basically the president of the union for 85,000 cops			2
it was the decision to either play it like him or just play it as i see it , so i just play stuff as i see it			0
@entity0 : what were your thoughts about the ending of @entity3 ? @entity1 : i loved it			1
other than , what the hell was @entity119 ? i still do n't know what @entity119 was			0
but i loved the ending , i thought it was a brilliant piece of writing , certainly @entity67 's opus			2
there was no better way to end it			0
and i love the fact that the chief just walks off and goes up to @entity128 and lives alone			0
yep , makes whiskey and builds castles and herds sheep			0
@entity0 : was " @entity99 " your next project , then ? @entity1 : i literally wrapped the last day of @entity3 , i wrapped at 5 a.m. on friday and on monday i was on a plane to @entity135 to start the new show			1
so , yeah , there was n't much of a break			0
@entity0 : how would you compare the character you 're playing now to @entity2 ? @entity1 : you know , they 're very similar guys			1
they 're both blue - collar guys , they 're both in charge of a group of people that they are fiercely loyal to , they will do whatever it takes to get the right thing done , they 're both very flawed , which makes them interesting to watch and interesting to play , they 're two guys that you could definitely go to a ball game and have a beer and make fun of people around you			2
@entity0 : how did you get into acting in the first place ? @entity1 : my mom says that when i was a little kid i always used to say i wanted to be an actor , but i do n't remember that			1
i remember in high school thinking that i wanted to be a lawyer , and now i realize i saw that movie " and @entity169 " when i was a kid and thought , " that 's what lawyers do , and i want to get up and yell and scream in the middle of a courtroom			1
" i want to be a lawyer on tv is what i finally figured out			2
i fell into it late			0
i think i was 27 or 28			0
i was working with a sports nutrition company doing diets for athletes and i met a guy who was working on his nutrition and he was an actor			0
i eventually quit my job and went back to theater school and that was it , the rest is history			0
@entity0 : besides acting , what are your hobbies ? @entity1 : sitting quietly and reading a book			1
i play hockey , i 'm a goalie , so people fire pucks at me			0
and i like to golf and i travel , i travel a lot			0
but mostly i 'm a pretty quiet guy			0
i just kind of go home and hide away			0
@entity0 : i see you 're wearing a shirt that says " @entity202			0
" @entity1 : " @entity202 , " yeah ! these are some friends of mine from @entity205 that have a website , chroniclesofthenerds.com			1
i have literally almost 400 t - shirts , because everywhere i go the fans know i like t - shirts			0
so they 're constantly giving me t - shirts			0
so , any time i get a chance to plug one of my friends or plug a band or something like that , i like to wear their shirts			0
and the fans think it 's really cool			0
so when i 'm at @entity223 or @entity4 i 'll switch shirts throughout the day , so people get pictures			1
@entity0 : you were at @entity4 last year , right ? @entity1 : i 've been at @entity4 , i think five of the last six years			1
last year i came as a fan			0
i did n't do any panels except for the one that i crashed			0
i did n't sign or do anything , i just wanted to experience it from the fan 's point of view , and it was really , really cool			0
i come here with , literally , like 25 friends and we take over an entire floor of the hotel and we just have a blast , it 's a great place			0
it 's like @entity244 without the gambling			0
@entity0 : what 's your favorite part of @entity4 ? @entity1 : the best times are usually in one of our rooms , where we 're all just sitting around having a drink and just laughing our faces off			1
it 's just hilarity for four or five days			0
it 's just hanging out with friends			0
i travel so much and i work so much and we 're all from such disparate parts of the country in different jobs			2
it 's hard for us all to get in the same place at the same time and @entity4 creates a good venue for that			1
@entity0 : anything you want to say to your fans ? @entity1 : everybody , go to @entity0 every day ! every , frackin day !			1
