@entity0 -- two senior state officials in @entity3 are vehemently denouncing allegations of political strong - arming in the governor 's name , the latest in a series of controversies lashing the @entity11 administration			1
lt. gov. @entity12 publicly denied an assertion by @entity15 mayor @entity14 that she conditioned @entity17 recovery money last year on @entity14 's support for a redevelopment project backed by @entity11			1
@entity14 said the ultimatum came down in a parking lot and involved a project proposed by a real estate developer , the @entity24 , with ties to @entity11			1
she said @entity12 invoked @entity11 's name in laying out the condition for storm relief and has relayed her story to federal prosecutors			1
" mayor @entity14 's version of our conversation in may of 2013 is not only false but is illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are examined , " @entity12 said at a @entity32 event in @entity33			1
@entity14 , a @entity41 , also said @entity43 commissioner @entity42 made a similar demand regarding storm aid and the real estate plan			2
he called the allegations " patently false and absurd on their face			0
" @entity42 added that he welcomes a " full and thorough law enforcement review of her libelous claims			0
" @entity14 said she stands by her account , remains " willing to testify under oath , " and will answer any questions from the @entity56			2
" the bottom line is , @entity61 , i mean , she came and she said this to me , you know , and i stand by my word , " @entity14 told @entity1 's " @entity65 " on monday night , referring to her conversation with the lieutenant governor			1
" she said she would deny it and she 's denying it , " the mayor said			2
fuel on the fire the accusations over the weekend added fuel to a political and legal firestorm that has consumed the @entity11 administration in recent weeks , mainly over suggestions top aides and advisers to the governor orchestrated traffic jams around the @entity80 in @entity81 last year to punish that town 's mayor for not endorsing @entity11 for re-election			1
a state legislative committee investigating that matter issued subpoenas last week to key @entity11 appointees , some of them still in their jobs and others who have recently left			2
@entity93 attorney @entity92 's office is also looking into the matter			1
@entity11 has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme that gained steam this month with the release of explosive e-mails between @entity11 appointees before , during and after the september traffic fiasco			0
having made his mark as a brash politician with cross-party appeal , @entity11 is viewed as a potential front - runner for the @entity108 presidential nomination in 2016 , if he decides to run			0
but the unfolding scandals have raised questions about his political and management style in a state where @entity114 dominate at the local level			0
despite the unfolding political turmoil at home , @entity11 remains popular out of state			0
he spent the weekend in @entity120 raising money for gov. @entity122 , who is running for re-election			0
@entity14 's accusation @entity15 , a historically working - class town on the banks of the @entity126 made famous by favorite son @entity127 , has experienced a resurgence in recent years			1
new development , cleaned up parks and neighborhood charm marketing nostalgia have boosted its image and attracted new residents and business			0
@entity14 , elected in 2009 as the city 's first female mayor , said @entity137 approached her and told her that supporting the development project by the @entity24 was critical for @entity15 receiving @entity17 aid			1
@entity140 said her dispatch was " a direct message from the governor , " @entity14 told @entity1 's " @entity144 " on sunday			1
it 's " stunning " and " outrageous , " but true , @entity14 said			2
" i stand by my word			0
" @entity14 told @entity147 on saturday that three days after her run - in with @entity148 , @entity42 delivered a similar message , that " money would start flowing " if she supported the project			0
@entity11 scandals : what you need to know @entity14 met with @entity92 's office for several hours at its request sunday and provided prosecutors with her journal , which contained information about the parking lot episode			1
@entity140 said she recalled having a conversation with @entity14 that day , but she remembered @entity162 arguing that @entity17 recovery aid and redevelopment were the same issue , according to a source close to @entity167 who was not authorized to speak publicly			1
" @entity12 remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in @entity15			1
she remembers @entity162 pressing @entity12 for money for @entity17			1
@entity12 remembers saying you ca n't tie the two together , " the source said			0
" and she remembers @entity14 continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for @entity17			1
" @entity162 disputes that account and provided @entity1 with letters that she said back up her case			1
on april 23 , she sent a letter to @entity11 's office that she argued says development and @entity17 aid should not be connected			1
" just as shore towns are not being asked for development in exchange for protecting them from future storms , the solution to @entity15 's flooding challenges can not be dependent on future development , " the letter read			2
she sent another letter to his office on may 8 asking for help with funding pumps			0
@entity14 's conversation with @entity199 happened just days later and the mayor said she believes the two events are related			1
" when you look at all of the events together , you can see that it was a progression			0
it was a progression of pressure and she was sent in to really make that final message to me , " @entity14 told @entity1 's " @entity65 360			1
" @entity12 spoke monday before mayors whose towns were also affected by @entity17 , a storm of historic proportions that heavily damaged shore and waterfront areas up and down the @entity216 coastline			1
the federal government authorized billions in aid			0
" frankly , i 'm surprised that mayor @entity14 has chosen to mischaracterize a conversation i had with her about development and job creation in @entity15 , " @entity12 said in remarks that appeared carefully planned to discredit @entity14 's allegations			1
christie aides push back @entity11 spokesman @entity227 said it was " categorically false " that @entity17 funds were withheld			1
" it 's very clear partisan politics are at play here as @entity114 mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television , " @entity227 said in a statement			0
building their case against @entity14 , @entity11 's administration hosted a conference call for reporters monday defending how @entity17 funds were allocated			1
@entity243 , executive director of the governor 's @entity244 , said that her accounting is " a mischaracterisation			0
" after @entity17 , @entity15 was 80 % underwater			2
@entity14 said it received about $ 300,000 of the roughly $ 100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention			2
@entity243 said @entity15 has been approved for nearly $ 70 million in aid			0
but that aid was given mostly to individual residents and small businesses , not the city of @entity15			0
the @entity15 allegation is the second to surface regarding @entity17 money			2
a federal watchdog , the inspector general for the @entity260 , is looking at protocols around state spending for a marketing ad for @entity17 recovery featuring @entity11 and his family			2
the @entity11 administration went with a firm that charged twice as much to produce the spot as another bidder			0

" @entity14 admitted to supporting @entity11 in the past , saying she is not a part of " the @entity114 machine			2
" but her comments over the weekend are a change from what she told @entity1 last week			0
she said then that she did n't think @entity17 funds for her city were tied to any instance of political retribution			1
" i do n't think it was retaliation , and i do n't have any reason to think it 's retaliation , but i 'm not satisfied with the amount of money i 've gotten so far , " @entity14 said			2
she did not mention her concerns about the redevelopment project			0
but sunday morning , @entity14 told @entity1 she did n't speak out before because she did n't think anyone would believe her			2
@entity1 received images of journal entries that @entity14 said she wrote at the time			2

instead , the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for " rehabilitation , " which results in fewer tax incentives			0
aides and advisers to @entity11 have ties to @entity335 & @entity336 , the law firm representing the @entity24			0
@entity335 & @entity336 lobbyist @entity338 was a former commissioner of the @entity339 , and @entity335 & @entity340 's @entity336 is chairman of the @entity316 and @entity3 and was appointed by @entity11			1
