@entity0 -- as the " @entity4 " revolutions dominate the news , @entity2 is marking the one - year anniversary of another uprising			1
that one overthrew the authoritarian regime of president @entity10 , who resigned last april			2
now , the woman who replaced him , @entity11 , follows developments in the @entity14 and @entity15 as she grapples with the aftermath of revolution in her own country			1
" it 's quite a difficult , thorny road , " she told @entity1 during a visit to @entity0 , to accept a " @entity22 " award from secretary of state @entity21			1
the non-stop media coverage of the @entity26 revolutions is a sharp contrast to the limited news of last year 's uprising in @entity2			1
@entity11 is disappointed that the violence in @entity2 did not spark the international outrage that violence in @entity14 countries has			1
" on april 7th ( of last year ) a crowd of people came to the central square in front of our @entity38 , " she says			2
" they were shot straight from the roof			0
eighty - seven people died , hundreds were wounded			0
yet nobody defined this as unacceptable or outrageous			0
" in july of last year , after @entity10 fled the country , @entity11 was sworn in			1
acting as interim leader , she pledged to serve for 18 months until new elections			0
and she made history , becoming @entity51 's first female head of state and head of government in a traditional , majority - @entity54 country			1
but making history has not solved the mountain of problems she faces			1
the @entity2 government is faltering			1
there are other major challenges , @entity11 says , including sharp increases in food prices and a budget shortfall			1
there are security problems : the central @entity67 nation borders @entity68 , a neighbor of @entity70			0
one of the first tasks @entity11 and her fellow opposition leaders worked on , after years of presidential rule , was introducing a new constitution with a parliamentary system			1
" as head of provisional government , i was everything : speaker , head of the government , interim president			2
we steadily reached what we had promised			0
and today power is not any more in the hands of any one person			0
" asked what is the biggest danger for a country after a revolution , she points out that the @entity2 revolution was led by young people , just as the uprisings in many of the @entity26 and @entity15 countries have been			1
" they said enough is enough , all this bribery and corruption			0
" but the @entity2 revolution was followed by violent ethnic fighting in the south of @entity2			1
" we lost people there , a lot of victims , " @entity11 recalls			2
the uprsising in @entity2 came after unrest in that country in 2005 that has come to be called the " @entity110 , " which led to the ouster of then - president @entity113			1
in any country undergoing revolution it 's critically important , she says , that whoever ends up holding power be very attentive to long - standing issues like ethnic rivalries			1
" you should have an exact plan of action , how you 'll fix it , " she says			0
" otherwise it will put you in danger			0
" @entity2 had some advantages over a few @entity14 and @entity15 nations : after the fall of the @entity129 it introduced freedom of speech and assembly			2
it has a strong civil society and trade unions			0
many young @entity2 study in the @entity135			2
@entity11 says events of last year were some of the toughest and most dramatic in @entity2 history			1
it was n't just an issue of survival , she says , but an issue " of sovereignty , of independence , of unity of the nation			0
" " we are an ancient nation in @entity51 on the @entity149 , quite famous			0
we have a rich history and traditions , " she says			2
it was a test for her country , and for herself			0
@entity11 says it 's important to be a role model for young women			1
" the situation is not as good as it was before , " she says			0
fundamentalist religion , she says , is on the rise and , as a result , the situation of women has deteriorated in her region			0
" in such a circumstances , to be a leader of the nation , this is really , i guess , a good impetus for thousands and thousands of women to be in the forefront of the nation			0
and i hope i will be a really good example			0
" receiving the @entity173 award from @entity21 , @entity11 was cited for " courageous leadership ... binding together a historically fractious opposition into a provisional government structure able to check the struggles for power from stirring up wider divisions in society			1
" @entity51 expert @entity181 of the @entity182 says : " that 's really a very conscious goal of hers , to be this example of the first woman in office in the region			0
" she has a strong sense of historic mission about what she 's doing			0
she wants to make a revolution that 's successful , that makes @entity2 a sustainable democracy , and even more than being the first woman , she really wants to be the first person who leaves ( office ) ... she sees it not only as making a revolution but creating a model that somebody could walk out the door			1
" @entity11 explains it this way : " as it happened , i was the person around whom other parties , political leaders , rallied			2
i 'm one of many millions of women in my country			2
and i 'm proud to say that we 've done this job			1
we did n't lose our sovereignty			0
" smiling broadly , she says : " so , women can do something in @entity2			2
