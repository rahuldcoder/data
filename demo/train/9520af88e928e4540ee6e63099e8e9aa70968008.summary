-- a @entity3 @entity2 group censured one of its own thursday , saying her words and actions since sending an e-mail last month depicting president @entity8 as a chimpanzee have been potentially offensive , damaging and insincere			1
capping a meeting thursday , the @entity11 @entity2 's executive committee voted 12 - 2 thursday to issue an ethics censure against @entity14			1
@entity2 official sorry for racist e-mail " the @entity2 of @entity11 condemns racism in any form , and this censure is consistent with that position , " the group said in a statement			1
a phone call thursday night to @entity14 , for her comment on the censure , was not immediately returned			2
last month , she found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an e-mail she says she received from a friend			0
it contained a doctored photo styled like a family portrait , showing two adult chimpanzees and a baby			0
the younger chimpanzee had a photo of @entity8 's face superimposed over the animal 's face			1
the caption that ran with the photo read , " now you know why no birth certificate			0
" @entity14 , who is a @entity47 activist and an elected member of the central committee of the @entity2 of @entity11 , said she felt the e-mail was a joke , @entity0 affiliate @entity46 reported			1
it referred to debate over whether or not @entity8 was born in the @entity52			2
soon after it came out , the county 's @entity2 chairman , @entity53 , called for @entity14 's resignation in a @entity58 message posted on the group 's website			1
@entity3 's @entity61 has also demanded that @entity14 step down			1
in an apology that included two @entity64 passages , @entity14 initially said she would not repeat her error			2
" i am an imperfect @entity67 lady who tries her best to live a @entity70 - like honoring life , " the statement said			0
" i would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity			0
so i ask for your forgiveness , for i am truly sorry			0

in its statement thursday , the @entity11 @entity2 committee called out @entity14 and said that she was aware the e-mail " could be viewed as offensive			1
" " then instead of owning up to her mistake and putting an end to the story , mrs. @entity14 immediately sought to blame others and downplay the matter as a joke , " the @entity2 committee said , calling the first apology she 'd made in a statement " not contrite " and " conditional			1
" the committee viewed her second apology as more sincere , while noting that the " three - day delay in issuing that apology resulted in a torrential barrage of unnecessary media attention			0
" " finally , the committee found that much of the good that was accomplished by mrs. @entity14 's second apology was undone by going on a media tour that continued to blame others for her actions , " the statement said			1
during her press conference , @entity14 referred to the e-mail as " political satire " -- insisting she had no intention of doing anything that would be racist			1
@entity8 and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate indicating he was born in @entity121 when he was running for president in 2008			2
on april 27 , after months of further speculation amid claims he was born in another country , he released the long - form of the same certificate in hopes of finally quelling the controversy			0
" we do not have time for this kind of silliness			0
we 've got better stuff to do , " the president said afterward .			0
