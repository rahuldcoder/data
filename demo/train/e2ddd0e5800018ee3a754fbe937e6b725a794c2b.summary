@entity0 -- tens of thousands of followers of anti-american shiite cleric @entity4 marked the ninth anniversary of the @entity7 invasion of @entity8 on monday by demanding improvements in public services in the war - torn country			1
some of the protesters carried coffins marked " electricity , " " water " and " education " through the streets of the southern oil city of @entity20			1
others carried cables and water containers to express their frustration with the lack of basic utilities			2
@entity8 security officials estimated the crowd at 100,000 to 120,000 people , many of whom carried @entity8 flags , banners and pictures of @entity4 -- the @entity36 leader whose former militia once fought numerous pitched battles with @entity7 troops			1
with the @entity7 military now out of @entity8 , the banners challenged @entity8 's new political leaders , asking " where are your promises ? " in a statement read by one of his allies , the cleric urged his followers to take their complaints to the ballot box			1
" if the government fails to listen to your demands , then you will decide what is best for you , " he said			0
about 30 % of @entity8 's population lacks access to clean drinking water , though the figure is up sharply from 2008 , according to the @entity61 's @entity8 index			0
electricity generation surpassed prewar levels in mid- 2007 but averaged about 56 % of demand in 2011 , @entity61 estimates			1
@entity8 seeks new oil routes amid @entity67 tensions @entity68 , who rarely makes public appearances , also called on his supporters to remain firm in their opposition to the @entity7 and @entity72			1
" if we unite our voices , then we will be able to defeat @entity7 , @entity72 and other enemies , " @entity73 told the crowd on @entity4 's behalf			1
a @entity7 - led army invaded @entity8 on march 20 , 2003 , toppling longtime dictator @entity80			2
but years of bloodshed followed the invasion as an insurgency led by @entity80 's allies took root , followed by sectarian warfare between @entity8 's @entity36 majority and @entity89 minority			0
@entity68 's militia , the @entity90 , was blamed for some of the worst violence			0
he formally disbanded the group in 2008 , announcing that it was transitioning into a movement to oppose secularism and @entity97 thought			0
meanwhile , his political movement has become a kingmaker in @entity8 politics : its 39 members of @entity8 's parliament were key to prime minister @entity104 's winning a second term			0
his supporters usually demonstrate in @entity0 to mark the anniversary			1
but they held this year 's rally in @entity20 because of tightened security in the capital as it prepares to host an @entity112 summit , security officials told @entity1			0
the @entity7 argued @entity80 's regime had been harboring forbidden stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons , long - range missiles and a nuclear weapons program			2
but inspectors later found that @entity0 had attempted to conceal some weapons - related research from the international community , but that @entity8 had been effectively disarmed under @entity124 sanctions in the 1990s			0
the invasion swiftly toppled @entity80 , who was later executed for the massacre of @entity36 villagers following an assassination attempt in the 1980s			0
but nearly 4,500 @entity7 and 300 - plus allied troops were killed before the last @entity7 troops left in december , while estimates of the @entity8 toll run well above 100,000 .			2
