-- the @entity2 's pessimistic forecasts on unemployment will lure households and businesses into amassing more debt , say economists , as interest rates remain at a record low			1
last week , newly - minted @entity2 governor @entity10 said rates would remain on hold at 0.5 % -- subject to " knockout " conditions on inflation -- until unemployment fell below 7 % , a target the bank says wo n't be met for three years			1
data released today showed that the @entity21 jobless level remained unchanged at 7.8 % in the three months to june , falling by just 4,000 jobs			1
@entity23 , chief @entity21 economist at @entity24 , told @entity0 that the central bank 's measures were too complicated and could " backfire			0

" if @entity21 's economy improves and unemployment falls , the @entity2 may increase rates sooner than expected , he said			1
in march , @entity21 finance minister @entity35 gave the @entity2 new powers to focus on growth , including unemployment , as well as its inflation target			1

he wanted to find somebody who did n't need that much pressure to consider more stimulus			0
" the @entity2 has already rolled out a Â £ 375 billion bond - buying program and an Â £ 80 billion scheme to get the banks lending in an effort to kickstart economic growth			1

" asked whether the @entity2 was becoming too political by interfering in unemployment , @entity61 , managing director of @entity62 , a global markets consultancy , told @entity0 : " i think in the more sophisticated economies the edges between what is the responsibility of the treasury and the central bank can become somewhat fuzzy			0
" he added : " i think it 's appropriate that a sophisticated central bank has as many levels or gears in the gear box to utilize and work with as possible ... and the fact that [ @entity10 ] has put these three knockout criteria in there means that he 's not allowing them to be manoeuvred into a corner			0
" the @entity2 outlined two " knock out " exceptions that could mean a rate rise regardless of unemployment			2
first , if inflation , 18 - 24 months ahead , were to rise 0.5 % above the current target and the second if medium - term inflation expectations remain " well anchored			1
" inflation is currently at 2.8 % , well above the bank 's 2 % target			0
in an interview with @entity90 on august 7 , @entity10 said that the bank is " not making any promise " on a time frame for raising interest rates			0
he said : " we 'd all be pleased if we could lower the rate of unemployment by creating more [ jobs ] sooner rather than later , and if that happens then ... the @entity2 will have to take a judgement at that point in time			1
" economic recovery the @entity21 economy is beginning to see signs of recovery as output increased by 0.6 % in the second quarter of 2013 , double the rate of expansion seen in the first three months of the year			2
despite a more positive economic outlook , @entity110 , senior analyst at @entity111 , told @entity0 that the @entity2 's jobs forecast was still too pessimistic , echoing @entity23 's comments that borrowing could spiral under inaccurate guidance			0
@entity110 said : " they 're pretty much used to embarrassing forecasts by now at the @entity2 ... i think we will reach 7 % [ unemployment ] probably toward the end of next year			2
" he added : " the nightmare scenario is that we reach one of the knockout inflation triggers whilst unemployment has n't fallen			0
" @entity10 should have waited to see if the @entity21 economy could continue its positive growth streak , according to @entity110			2
he said : " he 's been a little precipitate in that and runs the risk of damaging his credibility as well			0
" @entity10 's style @entity132 -- the @entity2 's first overseas governor in its 319 - year history -- took a similar policy stance in his stint as governor of the @entity138			1
the 48 - year - old kept rates on ice for a large part of his tenure , leaving the benchmark rate at 1 % from september 2010 through to his departure in the spring of 2013			2
last week was @entity10 's first press conference as @entity2 governor and @entity61 said the man known as the " rock star banker " was right to take decisive action at his first outing			1
" this was his first real chance to be his own man ... i think had he said nothing that would have been more damaging , " he added .			0
