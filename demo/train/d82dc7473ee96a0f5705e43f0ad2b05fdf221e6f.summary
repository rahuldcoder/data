-- sen. @entity1 , who is campaigning to become @entity4 's second @entity3 president , disagrees from the bottom of his gut with the first @entity3 to hold the office			1
in october , he told a catholic university audience that when he read the 1960 speech in which @entity10 said : " i believe in an @entity4 where the separation of church and state is absolute , " he " almost threw up			1
" more recently , he elaborated on his dyspeptic condition in an @entity14 television interview , calling @entity10 's credo " an absolutist doctrine that was abhorrent at the time of 1960			1
" but the @entity19 ministers who witnessed @entity10 's speech surely felt differently			1
in the 1960s , evangelical leaders were not concerned that @entity10 was too secular ; they were concerned that he was too @entity3			1
for most of @entity4 history , the @entity24 majority has regarded @entity26 with deep suspicion			1
many of the 13 colonies banned @entity26 from public office and prohibited @entity3 rituals			1
priests were banished and sometimes executed			0
after independence , the @entity32 protected @entity26 from the worst persecutions of the colonial period , but discrimination persisted , and anti-catholic paranoia raged with an intensity that would have made @entity40 blush			1
one popular book , " @entity42 of the @entity4 , " warned of a secret @entity44 plot to deliver @entity4 to the @entity46 empire			1
its author was @entity49 , co-inventor of the telegraph			0
such fears diminished as @entity3 immigrants assimilated in the 20th century , but many @entity24 remained hostile toward @entity3 politicians			0
during @entity10 's presidential campaign , the @entity54 documented 144 producers of anti-catholic campaign literature			1
the pamphlets warned of @entity60 influence over @entity4 policy and the prospect of state - funded catholic schools			1
most of the opposition came from evangelical groups like the @entity67 and the @entity68			0
in the face of unrelenting hostility , @entity10 decided to address concerns about his religion directly			2
speaking to a group of baptist ministers in @entity75 , he reassured them : " i believe in an @entity4 where the separation of church and state is absolute , where no @entity3 prelate would tell the president -- should he be @entity3 -- how to act , and no @entity24 minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote , where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference , and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him , or the people who might elect him			2
" perhaps @entity1 's father , an @entity92 immigrant who came to the @entity4 in 1930 , heard these words and understood the prejudice that @entity10 struggled against			1
but @entity1 was only 2 years old when they were spoken			0
if he has any memory of @entity26 ' difficult history in this country , he does not publicize it			1
nor do other @entity3 champions of the religious right in their determination to wash away the old hostilities that divided @entity103			0
evangelicals and @entity26 began collaborating politically in the late 1970s			1
the architect behind their reconciliation was a political strategist named @entity107			0
frustrated by the @entity109 's preoccupation with business interests , @entity107 sought to reorient the party toward religious and cultural issues			2
to this end , he founded the @entity114 , a conservative think tank , and the @entity116 , the first organization to represent what we now call the religious right			0
@entity107 , a @entity3 , knew that a @entity3 leader would not appeal to evangelicals , so he tried to recruit televangelist @entity123 to lead his cause			2
when @entity123 turned him down , @entity107 enlisted the rev. @entity125			0
@entity125 would later say that @entity26 and evangelicals found common ground in their opposition to abortion , but @entity107 remembered it somewhat differently			1
he had tried to mobilize evangelicals over abortion and failed			2
most @entity24 regarded abortion as a " catholic issue , " and many prominent baptist leaders had even endorsed the @entity134 decision			0
what actually brought @entity26 and evangelicals together was a common enemy			1
this imaginary enemy has gone by many names			0
in the 1970s and ' 80s , it was known as " secular humanism , " a fiendish anti-religious movement that had supposedly taken over the schools , the courts , the media and the government			0
in the 1990s , it was called " political correctness , " and rampaged through the universities			0
when @entity150 of @entity151 announced that @entity152 was under siege in 2004 , he blamed " secular progressives " in the media			0
meanwhile , @entity1 decries " cultural liberalism " and warns that the government is trying to destroy religious freedom by forcing @entity3 organizations to insure birth control			0
regardless of the name , the supposed enemy 's goals remain the same : to eradicate @entity164 from the public sphere and replace traditional judeo - christian values with a liberal agenda			2
its agents are progressive politicians , journalists , professors and nonprofit organizations			0
its creed is the separation of church and state that @entity10 once appealed to in his campaign to become the first @entity3 president			2
the construction of such a villain has been devastatingly effective in uniting the religious right			0
the same evangelical groups that once attacked @entity10 as an agent of the pope have become the foundation of @entity1 's support in the @entity188 primary , and his only rival for their vote is fellow catholic @entity192			1
but should santorum and his conservative @entity3 allies succeed in breaking down the barriers between state and religion , they may reap a bitter fruit			0
for without the secular menace to distract @entity24 from their doctrinal differences with @entity26 , the old enmities may rise again			1
and just as religious right leaders seldom extend their demands for religious freedom to @entity207 and other @entity209 religions , @entity26 might one day find the freedoms that they have come to take for granted are no longer assured			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 : *protestants* were deeply wary of @entity26 for most of @entity4 history
in 1960 , he writes , evangelicals feared @entity10 's @entity220 more than secularism
@entity213 : but a common enemy , secular authority , has united evangelicals and @entity26
doctrinal divisions could rise again , he says , and put @entity26 on the *defensive*
