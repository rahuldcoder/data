@entity0 -- @entity2 yearns to reunite with her undocumented immigrant son and his family , but she fears the stakes involved			1
her son , @entity9 , his wife and their two daughters will join as many as 125 families that will try to cross the @entity14 - @entity13 border on monday and demand that @entity17 officials allow them back in the country to join with their @entity17 relatives through a humanitarian visa or asylum			1
most , if not all , of the 125 families had earlier lived in the @entity17 as undocumented immigrants , including some who were earlier deported			1
the dramatic maneuver by so many families is designed to renew attention to how the @entity17 immigration system painfully breaks up families when members are deported for being undocumented immigrants			1
the families will stage their event on the @entity13 side of the @entity34 point of entry , between @entity35 and @entity36			1
" i 'm very worried			0
i sometimes ca n't sleep because i 'm thinking something could happen to them , " @entity2 said			2
that 's the feeling @entity2 has had since she found out a few weeks ago that her son and his family will be attempting to return from @entity43 , @entity13 , where they have been living the past two years			1
" he 's afraid but says he will try to see if he 's able to come back , " @entity2 , 56 , said in an interview in her @entity0 home			1
she spends her time caring for her other @entity17 - born grandchildren			1
she will anxiously wait on the @entity17 side of the @entity34 crossing to see if her son and his family will be admitted			1
her son and his wife had been living in the @entity17 as undocumented immigrants , but they were never arrested and voluntarily returned to @entity13 after he could n't find a decent job			1
their two daughters , however , were born in the @entity17 and are @entity17 citizens , and the @entity9 family hopes the citizen status of the two girls , ages 3 and 5 , will help their visa applications so that grandparents can be reunited with grandchildren and their parents			1
@entity9 also wants to unite his family with his siblings , who live in the @entity17			1
the family wo n't find monday 's quest easy , experts say			2
the event is part of the " bring them home " campaign led by the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , which calls itself " an undocumented youth - led network " of groups that tries to reunite families			1
" it 's incredible that we have to rely on actions like this , " said @entity78 , a member of @entity73			0
" there are so many families that want a way to come back			0
the reality should be that they should be able to come back an easier way and it 's not happening , " @entity78 says everyday hundreds of families are being separated under president @entity92 's administration			0
almost 2 million undocumented immigrants have been deported since the president took office five years ago , he said			1
monday 's action will be the third and largest event staged so far by the alliance			2
deportations : missing parents , scared kids " what happens is people will present themselves at the border and will be asked to be let back into the country because this is their home for lot of them , " @entity101 said			0
immigrants who have not been able to obtain a visa for entry can apply for an alternative visa known as humanitarian parole , according to the @entity116 website			0
these types of visas allow foreign residents to come into the country based on their particular situation			0
however , immigration lawyers say humanitarian parole is n't an easy document to obtain and that it 's granted case - by - case			0
" it 's a benefit that 's given to individuals that want to come to the @entity17 , generally for emergency reasons			2
it 's applied either with @entity133 or with @entity134 at the @entity135 , " said @entity131 , a @entity14 - based immigration lawyer			0
@entity131 said humanitarian parole is granted to those with true emergency or medical situations where they have to explain to an officer at the border why they want to be received by the @entity17			2
" generally they have to prove that they have tried to obtain a way to come in lawfully into the @entity17 and they will have to plead out their case to what is the valid reason , the emergency , " @entity131 said			2
long - lost son , 37 , to finally see mother after 35 years abroad the @entity73 says these families have the right to come back to this country , as many have children who are @entity17 citizens			1
" they lived here , they grew up here , and studied here			0
this is their community and this is their home and they do n't recognize @entity13 as their home country			2
just because they were born there does n't mean it 's their home , " said @entity78			0
the alliance 's other two efforts to reunite families involved nine young adults and 30 young adults -- all of them who once lived in the @entity17 as undocumented immigrants but had left the country for one reason or another , including through deportation			1
those two groups used the current political coinage of " dreamers " to describe themselves -- that is , young immigrants in the @entity17 without documentation			2
@entity184 is a moniker taken after an acronym of immigration reform legislation			0
" the first run had nine dreamers , second round had 30 and this time we are including families and parents in this round , " @entity78 said			0
in the first two rounds , @entity17 immigration officials detained all the participants and then released them , the alliance said			0
the majority obtained approval to stay temporarily in the @entity17 and are awaiting for their day before an immigration judge , who will determine their fate			0
the @entity9 family is nervous about the alliance 's latest effort			2
@entity9 , 32 , was undocumented , like his parents , when they brought him to the @entity17 at age 6			1
the family lived in @entity14 near @entity211 , where @entity2 raised all five of her children			1
they attended @entity0 schools and consider the @entity17 their home country			1
but @entity2 said @entity9 returned to @entity13 two years ago because he could n't find a job and he thought he could find more opportunity in @entity13			1
that did n't happen , the mother said			0
her son did n't qualify for the @entity92 initiative called the @entity224 because he did n't meet all the requirements that would have allowed him temporary permission to remain in the states , the mother said			0
" he told me the situation is hard , very hard " in @entity13 , @entity2 said			2
" he ca n't get ahead , sometimes there 's days he has a job and there 's other days he does n't and he tries to get by			0
but he regrets he left			0
" a tale of two republicans : a story of the @entity236 and immigration reform @entity92 said he ca n't stop deportation of immigrants , but maybe he can			0

@entity2 of @entity0 hopes to see her son and his family again
@entity9 , his wife , their two girls left the @entity17 for @entity13 two years ago
@entity9 and wife had lived in @entity17 as undocumented immigrants ; their girls are @entity17 - born
