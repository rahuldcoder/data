" the price it is at now has well exceeded my $ .99 minimum ; therefore , whoever wins within the @entity25 , will receive this painting delivered by me personally , " the reply says			1
the 18 - by - 24 - inch canvas features a blue , waving @entity30 flag with the words , " @entity32 , one nation , with liberty and justice for all " emblazoned across it			1
the auction was posted monday at a starting bid of 99 cents and is scheduled to end saturday			0
as of wednesday , 108 bids had been logged for the painting , ratcheting the price up to $ 110,100 , but it appears some bids were retracted and it was selling for $ 97,500 in the afternoon			2

you have so many people on your side i hope you know that ! " a commenter wrote on the @entity8 page			0
" thank you so much for the words of kindness and support , " reads the answer			2

those who are driving up the price are likely not art lovers , but more likely @entity4 's supporters			1
" @entity30 seems to love to support their causes , to put money towards them -- to support that , " she said			1
online , a flurry of tweets and @entity137 postings deride the painting 's originality and even accuse @entity4 of plagiarism			1
a democratic underground blog post points out if one were to zoom in and @entity143 one of its own photos of the @entity30 flag , which the site purchased from @entity149 , it would look very much like @entity4 's painting			1
when contacted , the site administrator said he thought it was " humorous " @entity4 had picked an image the site had used for its t - shirts long ago			2
" nor are we accusing @entity4 of photoshopping his artwork			1
if you do a @entity160 image search for ' @entity30 flag ' or ' @entity30 flag , ' that particular image comes up near the top of the results			1
so it appears to us that @entity4 found the image on @entity160 and used it as the basis for his painting , " @entity165 said in an e-mail			2
" since most of the people who visit our website are critics of @entity4 , we thought they would find it amusing that he 'd used a photograph that we had once used on our t - shirts			2
" the listing states that the painting is a signed original and that it was made using donated household latex paint			0
@entity4 has been in and out of the spotlight since his july acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17 - year - old @entity182 in 2012			2
