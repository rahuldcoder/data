-- fashion , food and music all take their cues from the past , so why not a little travel with a vintage twist ? here 's our down - the - years guide to yesterday 's holidays , with suggestions for how you can get a little taste of more -- or less -- glamorous eras			1
1910s as the twentieth century began travel overseas was the preserve of the wealthy and was starting to assume some of the grandeur we associate with this era			1
it was all possible thanks to boiling water , which became the steam that turned the turbines on steam trains and ships			1
this was the start of the ocean liner era -- passenger carrying airships were decades away -- with companies competing for speed , size and luxury			1
the @entity36 ship @entity34 , launched in 1907 , held the speed record for crossing the @entity38 for twenty years			1
@entity0 : 7 ways to experiment with travel how to do this today : cruises are more popular than ever before , but only @entity36 's transatlantic crossings between @entity44 and @entity45 preserve the spirit of travelling to get somewhere rather than boarding to eat and drink vast amounts while trying to sneakily sleep with fellow passengers			1
the queen mary 2 ( diesel driven ) is the only vessel sailing a transatlantic schedule each year			1
fares start at Â £ 699 including a flight home from your destination			1
1920s fast forward past the @entity57 into the decadent 1920s			1
whatever people did it involved jazz playing in the background and an elegantly - poised cigarette holder in their hand			1
the spirit of the age took people to the @entity67 , maybe @entity68 , @entity69 or @entity70 , but certainly to the house of someone rich and famous who would host with @entity73 , dips in the @entity74 and spare barely a thought for the penniless rabble about to get blindsided by the @entity76			1
how to do this today : the south of @entity79 remains a magnet for glam travel -- it 's just much cheaper to visit than it used to be			1
for starters , @entity68 is something of a budget air hub , serving destinations across @entity86 , and is also an excellent base for exploring the region			1
a stroll along the city 's @entity90 is evocative of another age , no matter where you 're staying			1
1930s the giant @entity96 airship is the iconic image of this decade , and it was these mammoth beasts that carried long - distance airborne traffic throughout the 1930s			1
the most famous of these , the ill - fated @entity101 , carried between 50 and 72 passengers			2
it was 243 meters long -- over three times as long as an @entity105 , the largest commercial plane in service			2
it also took 68 hours to reach @entity109 , @entity110 from @entity111			2
how to do this today : @entity113 is one of the few places you 'll find airships today			2
airship ventures offer tours of the @entity119 and other parts of @entity113 , with flights starting at $ 375 for 45 minutes			1
1940s tourism in many places ground to a halt in the 1940s , but @entity127 trains enjoyed boom years before the post-war rise of the automobile			2
comfortable , sleekly - liveried services operated high - speed , long - distance services with evocative names like the @entity134 and @entity135			2
think shiny cutlery serving fine fare inside equally shiny trains			2
how to do this today : some great @entity127 rail services still operate			1
the @entity141 leaves @entity143 's iconic @entity142 each day , bound for @entity144 or @entity145			2
the 2200 - mile journey takes 46 hours and features cheese and wine tasting along the route			2
1950s while for some , the 50s were about the development of a political ideology from the back of a bike in @entity155 or road trips across @entity155 , ( think @entity158 's classic " @entity160 " ) , for others they were as glamorous as the days of pre-war hedonism			2
the @entity162 , ushered in by entry into service of the @entity166 - built @entity165 in 1952 means travel becomes sleek , fast and fun			2
how to do this today : cocktails in @entity171 recall the pre-revolutionary island vividly portrayed in @entity173 , @entity174 in @entity175 may be a popular spot for a tourist tipple , but you know you 're following in some famous footsteps			0
@entity0 : how not to behave on an airplane 1960s the 60s were the decade that travel changed forever			0
the advent of mass tourism introduced a generation of northern @entity86 to just how quickly the @entity188 sun could turn you lobster pink , and forever transformed sleepy fishing villages into brash , in - your - face holiday resorts			1
even today , the straw donkey remains an iconic souvenir of this time , and one redolent of stellar tackiness			0
how to do this today : the digital age ushered in choice and flexibility to a sunshine holiday			1
now you can come and sizzle on the costa of your choice via traditional package or budget flight and self - catering apartment			0
and going is still the only way of securing a straw donkey which , astonishingly , can not be purchased online			0
1970s while @entity210 and @entity211 were schlepping to the @entity212 ( or other fashionable costa ) , rebellious teenagers dropped out and headed for @entity214			0
the @entity216 was at its zenith in the 1970s , bringing to various parts of the @entity219 and @entity221 gaggles of long - haired kaftan - wearing westerners , fugs of smoke and impromptu yoga sessions			0
how to do this today : crossing @entity228 and @entity229 takes a little more planning than it did 40 years ago , and @entity231 is not the crossroads it once was			0
anyone heading from @entity234 to @entity235 will find there is still a @entity237 in @entity214 , complete with chocolate cake , dreadlocks and all the tie - dye you can handle			0
1980s the 80s brought wider horizons for millions of younger travelers as an adventurous few months on the road gained popularity			0
the @entity86 rail pass -- whether @entity248 or @entity249 -- was at the peak of popularity			1
this excellent value way to cross the continent did n't just link big cities and idyllic rural branch lines , it also brought together penniless travelers from around the world for a month - long series of rolling parties			0
not that anyone even vaguely attractive wanted to talk to you , as you had n't had a wash since @entity264 a fortnight ago			0
how to do this today : @entity248 is still around , and still a great way to explore @entity86			1
in fact , you can combine it with budget flights to avoid back - tracking			0
the true connoisseur will take the time - honored option of sleeping on the free ferry from @entity276 to @entity277 , under the @entity279 stars			0
1990s in the early 1990s the world opened up to travelers , with previously hard - to - reach places emerging from decades of isolation			0
from the @entity285 to @entity286 , this was a decade of blazing new trails			0
and as the decade ended , improved transport and communication links meant more places were accessible as well as safer , and you could reliably phone home to brag about it			0
how to do this today : the old world continues to meet the new in @entity297 , which began the 1990s as part of the @entity299 and finished it as a @entity301 of @entity302			0
the cream teas and @entity304 at the @entity305 are still here but they 've been joined by fast rail links to the rest of @entity302 and ranks of new skyscrapers jostling for space on the city 's famous skyline			0
2000s how dull flying must have been when we had our bags taken from us with little fuss then receive an assigned seat and a complimentary meal , before arriving at a convenient rather than remote airport for our destination ! and yet , before low - cost carriers swept the globe , this was what came as standard when flying			0
by the time the decade was out , flag carriers were in retreat for all but long - haul flying and a 60km journey to central @entity332 had become part of the fun			0
how to do this today : take a weekend break to an obscure destination in eastern @entity86			1
@entity339 , @entity340 or @entity341 , @entity342 both fit the bill			0
@entity0 : dropping a line : the history of postcards © 2011 @entity0			0
