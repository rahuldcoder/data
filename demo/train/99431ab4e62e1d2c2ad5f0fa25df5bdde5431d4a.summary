-- in an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores , @entity5 , the international wireless industry association , yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt. @entity9 and @entity10 basically told the @entity5 to stuff it -- they 're sticking with their own rating schemes			1
" we 've put a lot of effort into @entity18 's rating system , which now works well globally , " @entity9 spokesman @entity12 said in a statement			1
" while we support other systems , we think it 's best for @entity18 users and developers to stick with @entity18 's existing ratings			1
" @entity10 , too , has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail , but has not publicly commented on the @entity5 app rating issue			1
in the @entity18 , @entity9 assigns content ratings that range from " everyone " to " @entity29 " to " @entity33 , " but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings			1
however , outlines for the ratings are provided in @entity9 's android market support forum			2
in its @entity37 , @entity10 provides an age rating ranging from 4 + to 17 + , and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating			1
for instance @entity41 received a 9 + rating for @entity44 and @entity45 or @entity46			0
the @entity5 's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five - point scale based on their violence and sexual content			0
the ratings , which would be controlled by the @entity55 ( which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings ) would range from " everyone " to " adults only			2
" @entity10 's @entity37 alone has more than half a million apps and @entity18 is getting close to that number with at least 300,000			1
@entity5 announced it would be developing its app rating system in march			1
the initiative would call for " voluntary self - certification of apps			0
" the system would make it easier for parents to see -- regardless of mobile platform -- if an app was appropriate for their child			0
the mobile application rating system was officially announced on tuesday			2
@entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 are the founding bodies of the age - appropriateness rating system			2
it works like this : app developers answer an online questionnaire about their app 's content , including whether it shares location information , has a social networking component , and if it contains violence or sexual content , among other things			0
apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously , and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating , it could appeal it			0
the @entity55 would regularly test popular applications and monitor complaints			0
