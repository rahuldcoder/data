-- it 's @entity2 2013			1
i can feel the wind on my face			2
my heart rate is steady , but i 'm so full of joy and pride it may beat out of my chest			2
i can hear my friends yelling from the sidelines : " you did it ! we 're so proud of you ! " i try to choke back tears			1
my knees buckle as 14 people surround me			1
i have just finished my first 5k race			2
but wait -- something is missing			0
my two best friends are nowhere to be seen			1
" your relationships will change			1
" i heard that piece of advice more than any other during the @entity26 kickoff weekend			0
i think about those four words often			0
finding fitness that works for you i was always someone a friend could call at a moment 's notice to go out			1
when i finally decided to get healthy , i could n't continue to do that			1
i made a conscious decision to change where i hung out , who i hung out with and what we did when we were hanging out			0
the majority of my friends are health - conscious , so i did n't think any of my relationships would change much			1
going out to eat is a rare occasion these days , and i ca n't remember the last time i had a drink			1
all of my free time is spent at the gym or doing something active			1
to maintain my active lifestyle i make sure i get a minimum of seven hours of sleep every night			0
most of my friends are going out when i 'm going to bed			1
i knew my best friends and i had n't seen each other in a while , but in all the years we 've known each other , we had never missed the " big stuff			1
" that morning , after my first race , i checked my phone			0
there were messages from both of them telling me how proud they were , but that @entity64 had gotten the best of them			0
later , i explained how hurt i was that they were n't there			1
i found out they were hurt , too			2
they felt like they did n't " fit into " my life anymore			0
we had always spent time together seeing the latest movie , checking out a new restaurant or going to a concert			2
@entity77 basketball games were our favorite , but most of those games were at 8 p.m. thursdays and i was in bed			0
the @entity82 they knew and loved was changing			0
work out your mind first it was hard to hear			0
but we talked it out and -- because we 're women -- we had a really good cry			0
any time there is a new challenge in your life , be prepared for your relationships to change			1
your friendships will change ; your family life will change			0
and do n't be surprised when the most significant change is your relationship with yourself			0
i thought the absence of certain people in my life was temporary			2
the changes i 've made and continue to make are permanent lifestyle investments in me and my ultimate goal of living the rest of my life as a healthy , happy , active adult			2
i 've made new friends since the beginning of my journey			2
i 'm a social person so i 'm always going to have a group around			0
some of that group has changed because i needed it to , but those who matter have weathered the changes with me and will always have my back no matter where life takes us			1
get fit and others will follow my friends and i still do n't see each other as often as we did , and probably never will			2
but we check in on each other and have made a promise to hang out at least once a month			0
when i cross the finish line of my first half - marathon on april 27 , i know both of them will be there with smiles on their faces , arms open wide and pride in their hearts for whom i 'm becoming			0
