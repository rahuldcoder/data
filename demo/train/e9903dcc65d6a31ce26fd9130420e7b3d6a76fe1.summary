-- there is a little good news for mothers in the @entity4			1
the @entity4 has moved up six places -- from 31st to 25th -- in the annual @entity7 report			1
that puts the @entity4 right between @entity9 and the @entity10			1
@entity11 is no. 1 , just ahead of @entity13 and @entity14			1
the report 's ranking of 165 nations factors in measures of education , health and economic status as well as the health and nutrition of children			1
" there 's still an awful lot that we need to do , " said @entity25 , the president of @entity7			1
the @entity4 has made strides with respect to better care for teen moms and also in electing more women to government positions , which the organization sees as an important measure of how society values women			1
but it has to do more , @entity41 and others stress			0
" we valorize parenthood and in particular , motherhood , while at the same time we offer very few supports , " said @entity43 , a professor of sociology at @entity45			0
so while the @entity4 recognizes mothers for their incredibly important role as the primary caregivers to children , it still has n't done enough to help raise the kids			1
it 's no secret : raising a child is stressful and really expensive			2
a new mother needs a lot of help , @entity43 said , and other countries provide more government assistance than the @entity4 does			1
" unlike other industrialized nations , we lack the kind of state - level protections and policies that would reduce some of that stress , " she said , speaking of " family - friendly entitlement programs " like universal health care			1
another place the @entity4 could start improving is with maternity leave			1
thanks to the 2 - decade - old @entity74 , new mothers get 12 weeks of unpaid leave			2
in @entity77 , it 's 52 weeks , 50 of which are paid			2
@entity77 , by the way , is 19th in the rankings			0
@entity81 , a professor of history at @entity83 who is working on a book on the cultural history of the working @entity4 mother , said companies that do offer paid leave do so more for professional middle - and upper - ranked workers			1
" that tends to leave lower - paid and less - skilled workers behind so there 's an inequality in the distribution of those benefits , " she said			2
the poor around the world are victims of growing inequality , the @entity7 report shows			2
the gap between the level of care and commitment to mothers and children in the top 10 nations -- all developed countries -- and the bottom 10 is growing , @entity41 said			1
here 's a statistic that jumps right at you : in bottom - ranking @entity113 , almost every mother will lose at least one child in her lifetime			2
it is the opposite in @entity11 , where every birth is attended to by a health professional			0
@entity41 , a mother of three , said she has talked to women in the poorest countries who had no other person present at the birth of their children			0
she said her organization has been working hard for the past five years to make sure there are more health workers to attend to births in those countries			0
" forty percent of children that die under the age of 5 die in the first month , " she said			0
" and the most dangerous day for a child is the day they are born			0
" the report is n't entirely deflating			2
there is good news from perennial last - place @entity140 , which moved up one notch			0
it does n't look significant in the report 's black and white type , but it is , @entity41 said			1
" it reflects some real progress in that country , " she said , pointing to the fact that there is a much higher rate of education for girls there			0
education is one vital component in improving the lives of mothers , @entity81 said			2
" there 's very clear evidence for people who do this kind of work that when you provide women access to education , that when you provide them access to independent abilities to support themselves , and then when you provide them with health care , maternal and infant health go up in correspondence with each other , " she said			1
she said it happens in industrialized nations too where consistent , reliable programs for prenatal and maternal health care are provided			1
" you can see a correlation for better outcomes for mothers and children , " she said			0
some of the solutions do n't have to be hard , @entity41 said			0
" we talk about the ' lifesaving six ' things in nutrition , and one of those is breast - feeding practices , " she said			0
and everyone needs to pitch in , she said			0
certainly moms need to take the lead , but governments also need to establish friendly policies toward breast - feeding and companies need to welcome it			0
it 's one of the most important things that can save kids ' lives , along with providing clean water , @entity41 said			0
" it has to be everyone saying , ' this does n't have to happen in our country			0

@entity4 lands at no. 25 on the annual @entity209 's mothers report
@entity4 has made strides with respect to better care for teen moms
lack of support from governmental and other programs *pushes* @entity4 down
