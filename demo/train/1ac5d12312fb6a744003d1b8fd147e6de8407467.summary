-- @entity3 football 's summer months are dominated by back - page headlines of glamorous transfers involving the game 's most prestigious players , with @entity9 's @entity8 the most notable example this last few weeks as he ponders whether to stay with the @entity12 club after saying he will not renew his contract			1
but at the bottom of the football pyramid -- a world that receives little attention from the global media -- there are many deals that involve young players who are just starting their careers , the clubs that have trained them , and those that are interested in signing them in the hope that they might be the next @entity28			1
the story of @entity28 's early years in @entity30 and his signing by @entity32 has been retold countless times			0
of how , diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency , the kid who would become the world 's best player went to @entity37 after @entity32 offered to pay his medical bills			0
what is less well known is that @entity32 did not immediately pay his former club @entity40 the training compensation fee that the @entity30 team was due			0
can @entity45 's big bucks buy world domination ? @entity40 did claim $ 42,867 in reparation , but had to go all the way to @entity50 's @entity49 to get the payment			1
it takes time and money for clubs to develop players , but the rewards can be enormous given the voracious appetite of ambitious teams looking for new talent			1
but this talent trawl leaves casualties and an academic study in 2009 estimated as many as 20,000 @entity65 boys are living in the streets of @entity67 after failing to secure contracts with @entity3 clubs following their trials			1
under rules established by football 's international governing body @entity50 , those clubs seeking that new talent agree to pay the team that nurtured the youngster a " training compensation " fee			1
@entity50 has a cash formula that is designed to compensate the " training club " for the years spent developing players up to the age of 23 , when they sign their first professional contract			2
however , sports agent @entity84 says some @entity3 teams do not always play ball in agreeing these compensation fees			1
@entity84 , who has worked as a player agent and once represented former @entity90 international @entity89 , has taken to posting about training compensation on @entity92 , pointing to the way social media was used during the @entity95 as a motivation in raising publicity over the issue			1
" it 's a matter of culture , " @entity84 writes on @entity92 , recounting what he says he was told by an executive of a @entity3 team ahead of the @entity103 final in @entity104 back in may			1
" @entity3 clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees , but when it comes to settling training compensation to @entity65 or @entity112 clubs , it becomes a problem			1
" clubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach @entity50 , but until then they buy time			2
" the @entity90 agent is football 's equivalent of a bounty hunter , taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before @entity50 to claim training compensation from larger clubs			1
@entity84 details his disputes with a number of those @entity3 clubs on @entity92 , claiming they failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development club , based on @entity50 's formula			1
unhappy about these @entity92 postings , at least two of those clubs -- @entity137 's @entity136 and @entity138 of @entity139 -- have complained to @entity50 about what they claim is " defamation and calumny "			1
" @entity50 can confirm that @entity136 and @entity138 have lodged complaints against the agent @entity84 and that @entity50 has opened a case , " @entity50 told @entity0			1
" however , as the investigations are currently ongoing we can not comment or speculate at this stage			0
" but as well referencing the @entity95 , @entity84 quotes the @entity148 -- " everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression " -- as justification for his campaign			2
in one of the cases @entity84 posts about , he claims @entity136 owes @entity158 of @entity160 compensation involving its training of the player @entity162			1
he says the claim is based on the calculation that @entity165 was with the @entity90 club for four years before moving to @entity137			0
@entity162 initially joined @entity167 and then signed for @entity136 , with @entity158 not compensated for those formative years of training as per @entity50 's rules			2
" at this stage , i just can tell you that the player gave three different declarations ( one of them signed by his father , when @entity162 was still a minor ) about the duration of his registration to @entity158 -- nine months ; 24 months ; 48 months circa , " said @entity170 , the lawyer acting for @entity136			0
" @entity136 immediately paid on may 2011 the amount requested by @entity84 pursuant to the first player 's declaration and moreover in conformity with @entity158 's records , as collected by @entity185 ( @entity186 ) in the so - called sport passport , duly attached to the first @entity84 claim			2
" the last declaration has been released by @entity165 in @entity90 , in january 2012 , after his escape from @entity137 and from contractual obligations with @entity136			0
" @entity192 tells a very different story , insisting he has full the support of @entity165 , who recently returned to @entity90 after signing with @entity196 , and that the @entity90 footballer confirms he had been at @entity158 for four years since the age of 12 from 2004			0
the gambling game : soccer 's battle with betting " the claim is for @entity158 and has nothing to do with @entity165 , " added @entity84 , after @entity0 asked to interview the player			2
as for @entity138 , general manager @entity205 refused to comment on @entity84 's $ 122,822 compensation claim on behalf of @entity208 club @entity207 relating to one of their players , but added : " we have introduced a file against @entity84 by @entity50			1
we will defend our position at the court			0
" @entity84 works closely with the @entity217 manager @entity216 , who keeps track of 140,000 players on a computer database and believes hundreds of young players literally " disappear " from their clubs -- lured away by agents and scouts			1
" i know they 've all gone to @entity67 , most of them have the possibility of acquiring dual citizenship , " says @entity216			0
@entity84 claims on @entity92 that " a generation of dozens of young @entity90 and @entity65 players were literally taken away from their original clubs by dubious agents and brought to @entity137 under the so - called primo tesseramento ( first contract )			1
" often smaller clubs in @entity90 and @entity65 do not have the financial resources to find out what has happened to their players after they have left , presumably for @entity67 -- which means they are often left without compensation			1
that is where @entity84 steps in			0
after a player has turned professional , @entity84 -- with the help of @entity216 -- tracks down the development club to see if there are compensation issues and then begins the administrative process of demanding what he says is the correct sum to be paid by the @entity3 clubs			1
" in the beginning i was approaching the clubs , but now more and more i am approached by clubs , " said @entity84			2
" all due to the internet , as you can imagine			0
some @entity65 agents have sent me messages saying i 've become an icon			0
" in an arrangement that is reminiscent of the kind of fees " uplift " that successful personal injury lawyers use to get paid if and when a dispute is resolved , @entity260 would receive a 20 % commission of the amount of the claim			1
so in the cases he lists on @entity92 , the potential compensation amount is close to $ 2.4 million , which would net @entity84 approximately $ 480,000 if he is successful			2
" @entity278 clubs are always challenging the conformity of training compensation with @entity282 law , " said @entity30 lawyer @entity272 , who also has experience with of this area and it is a view supported by @entity276 lawyer @entity275			0
" the @entity294 case may have increased player power , " said @entity275 , referring to the landmark judgment allowing players to move for free at the end of their contract , " but ongoing uncertainty over the best way to calculate compensation still allows clubs the chance to push back or delay payment			1
" blog : time to get tough on racism in football @entity272 admits these cases are a gravy train for agents and lawyers			0
" this is also a business for sports lawyers , i have to confess			0
not only @entity112 but also big @entity3 firms ( mostly @entity37 due to language issues ) offer clubs the services to claim and collect such compensations			2
fees can be as high as 30 % of the amount , " he said			0
gravy train or not , this issue may also be an administrative headache for @entity50 , which says it receives 3,500 complaints a year -- though not all of these relate to training compensation cases			2
" @entity50 's normal procedure says that a case should be opened within three to five weeks after the claim is lodged , " said lawyer @entity319 , who works with @entity84			1
" @entity50 says that an ordinary case would take six to 12 months to be solved			0
however , we have cases in progress for almost two years and we 're not halfway through			0
" you can not imagine the time and energy spent trying to reach a @entity50 officer to have information about the claims			2
it is almost a lost battle ; the most common responses we get are , ' we are overloaded , ' ' we have no time			0
' " in a statement to @entity0 , @entity50 said : " cases are normally opened within a couple of weeks following the receipt of the relevant complaint			0
" as to the duration of a specific procedure , we need to emphasize that many factors influence the advancement of the investigation phase and the decision - making process : the cooperation of the parties , the complexity of the matter , the extent of the documentation provided , the availability of the deciding body -- just to name a few			0
" consequently , we are really not in a position to comment on an estimated timescale			0
" in a recent edition of the @entity359 , a doctoral researcher at @entity362 's @entity361 came up with an idea to help protect the treatment of minors in football			0
" a possible solution to prevent such circumstances could be introduction of a form of authorization for trials via the transfer matching system , albeit trials can not be deemed as a transfer , " wrote @entity367 , referring to @entity50 's governing body electronic method of conducting transfers			2
so as the lawyers , agents and administrators argue , does @entity216 have any advice for parents considering letting their offspring move to @entity3 clubs ? " first you should build the athlete up , maintain his focus on school and look for an agent -- properly accredited -- with the goal of taking care of his professional career			1
