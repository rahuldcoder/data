@entity0 -- @entity3 's interim prime minister said on tuesday that he expects the county to have a new government within 10 days			1
@entity6 , head of the @entity8 's executive board , spoke at a @entity10 conference on the sidelines of the @entity12			0
" i expect the government to be announced within a week , 10 days maximum from now ... most of the work has been done , " he said			1
" i think this government , when formed , will help tremendously , bring about stability and order in @entity16 and the rest of the country			2
therefore , i am not bothered by the time we are consuming to bring about some sort of national consensus behind this government			0
" @entity6 said negotiations include discussion of the number of ministries the new government will have and where they will be located			0
earlier tuesday , @entity0 @entity26 ban ki - moon congratulated @entity3 's transitional leadership on the apparent success of that country 's revolution , ushering in a @entity32 era for the @entity34 nation as part of the international body			1
" for @entity3 , this is a historic day , " said @entity26 , who directed that the country 's new flag be presented alongside the @entity0 flag amid a standing ovation from those in attendance			1
the @entity12 overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of the country 's new leadership after rebels last month all but ousted @entity3 strongman @entity48 after more than four decades in power			1
" i am sure you saw your new flag this morning , flying so proudly outside this building , " the @entity0 chief said			1
the rebuilding of @entity3 and the @entity56 quest for statehood are expected to be the dominant topics this week as world leaders converge on the @entity0 in @entity60 for the 66th annual session of the @entity12			1
on tuesday , @entity26 met with @entity62 -- head of @entity3 's ruling @entity8 -- to discuss the deployment of a support mission to be run by @entity66 diplomat and @entity0 envoy @entity67			1
the mission is thought to largely center on post-conflict planning , with particular focus on security - building and electoral assistance			0
but @entity74 participation , the @entity0 chief says , is instrumental in supporting the new government , noting challenges facing transitional leadership as it confronts pockets of resistance and the specter of @entity48 , who remains at large			1
@entity74 president @entity81 vowed to continue to protect @entity3 civilians for as long as they remained threatened by the former regime , pledging to reopen the @entity74 embassy in @entity16 later this week			2
" six months ago , as his tanks approached @entity87 , @entity48 predicted that his opponents would be slaughtered like rats , " said @entity66 foreign secretary @entity85			0
" but he had not counted on the courage of the @entity3 people , the principled stand of the @entity93 and the resolve of the international community			2
" @entity85 said he sought to send to a clear message to the former dictator and his remaining supporters that " their time is up , " adding that the unfreezing of @entity3 assets will help pay for the country 's critical services			1
tuesday 's @entity3 summit at the @entity12 was billed as an event designed to give world leaders a chance to figure out ways to help @entity3 rebuild from the battle against their former leader			2
the meeting was in stark contrast to two years ago , when @entity48 gave a rambling general assembly address where he floated conspiracy theories , urged probes into @entity74 military activities and took aim at the structure of the @entity122 itself			0
meanwhile , the international body also focused on what it described as an alarming increase in global desertification , and wrapped a two - day meeting on noncommunicable diseases , now the world 's leading killer			2
it is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the @entity12 , following the group 's pledge to take on @entity137 a decade ago			2
delegates unanimously approved a " political declaration " on monday , addressing illnesses including cancer , cardiovascular disease , chronic lung diseases and diabetes in developing countries , which often struggle with limited budgets and overwhelmed health care systems			0
also on the plate of @entity0 activities this week is an expected address from @entity152 president @entity151 , who will take the podium thursday to address recent changes in the @entity155			1
his visit marks the seventh time the @entity152 president has traveled to @entity60 since he took office in 2005			0
@entity151 told @entity152 state media on monday that the @entity0 must meet the international community 's " real demands , " raising questions as to whether the @entity152 leader will broach the issue of @entity56 statehood , a lightning - rod topic and the subject of much diplomatic wrangling			1
the @entity74 has pledged to block a @entity56 membership application should it reach the @entity122 , but is likely eager to head - off a scenario that would involve an @entity74 veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular in the @entity155			1
@entity56 president @entity174 has , however , seemed largely undeterred			2
in a speech friday that appeared both an attempt to manage domestic expectations and push the statehood issue , the @entity56 leader told an audience in @entity181 , " we are going to the @entity0 to attain full membership			1
" he has said the @entity56 territories should be represented by their " natural borders " -- with @entity186 remaining within its 1967 boundaries , which would afford @entity56 the @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity190			2
he called disputed territories inhabited by @entity186 settlers " illegal			0
" on friday , the body will address the controversial bid			0
@entity174 is scheduled to speak , and has said after he gives that speech , he will deliver a formal membership application to the @entity0 secretary - general			1
@entity186 prime minister @entity198 , who opposes the measure , is scheduled to speak later in the day and has called the move provocative and pushed for a return to the negotiating table			0
the @entity56 territories currently have " observer " status , meaning delegates can speak in the @entity12 but not vote			0
a " yes " vote in the @entity12 -- where only a majority vote would be needed -- could afford @entity56 with the status of " permanent observer , " similar to the position the @entity212 currently holds			0
a vote in their favor would be all but assured , meaning they could pursue legal actions against @entity186 , though analysts suggest that the elevated status could prematurely raise expectations for change in the region			0
@entity223 , the @entity56 organization that controls @entity188 , has warned @entity174 against making the request , saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with @entity186 , which would " deprive the @entity56 people from their right to come back to their homeland			0
" the five permanent members of the @entity122 are the @entity74 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and the @entity66			0
the @entity12 , the @entity0 's main policy - making body , has 193 member nations			1
@entity1 's @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
