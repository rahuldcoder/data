rumors and speculation are running wild , as the @entity2 prepares for its 18th @entity3			0
so far , though , the most tangible thing about the @entity3 is the massive deployment of extended security measures in @entity7 , resulting in the cancelation of academic conferences , art exhibitions , performances and even private meetings			0
in a way , the @entity2 is asking the entire @entity7 nation to hold its breath until the @entity3 ends			0
all this effort is expended over the transfer of power to the " next generation " of @entity7 leaders			2
indeed , these extra security measures indicate that the leaders of the @entity2 understand well their weakness : that the fragility of an authoritarian system lies in its transfer of power			1
@entity7 's next leaders : who 's who that is , despite its domination over the lives of the @entity7 people , even the @entity2 is not exempt from the general political axiom that a governing régime relies on popular acceptance of its authority			1
the problem is that is no one , not even the party 's own members , voted for the next generation of @entity2 leaders			1
there are no laws -- or even any clear rules -- that govern the selection of leaders , leaving the matter of choosing the top leaders of the most populous nation on earth entirely at the mercy of the party 's forever changing internal logic			1
read about the struggle of ideas among @entity7 's leadership even after a decade as the top leader of @entity7 , how exactly president @entity59 became @entity61 's designated successor remains a mystery even to expert analysts and historians			1
the selection process is and will always remain at the highest level of state secrets , guarded even from the majority of @entity2 members			1
the most important reason is that any detail , if known , could be used as ammunition for internal party strife and dangerously expose the leadership 's vulnerabilities			2
on april 30 , 1976 , after premier @entity77 had accompanied chairman @entity78 to a meeting with @entity81 prime minister @entity80 , @entity76 told @entity78 that he would summon activists from @entity84 and @entity85 provinces to @entity86 for a conference to strengthen the " @entity88			0
" @entity78 was already suffering from a neural disease that made him unable to speak , so he replied by jotting down a note that read : " with you in charge , i am at ease			0
" five months later , @entity78 died , and @entity76 became his successor as chairman			2
that note became the main vehicle of state propaganda efforts to lend @entity99 legitimacy			2
and in order to keep its original limited context a secret , foreign minister @entity100 , an eyewitness to the original exchange , was sacked			0
it is unlikely that the public will ever know how @entity107 became the designated successor of @entity59			1
whether or not he was actually handpicked by @entity61 , as rumored , will remain a secret , and even if @entity61 were confirmed to have picked @entity107 , @entity61 does not have the charismatic stature of @entity78 to lend instant legitimacy to his chosen successor , and the lack of public consent would only be highlighted			1
in @entity76 's case , details surfaced only after he was politically sidelined and excluded from positions of power			0
in addition to the selection of president and the party 's general secretary , the selection of the powerful @entity120 is another top level state secret , because the details of who nominated whom would allow political analysts to figure out factional affiliations and map out the complex web of entrenched interests			1
read why @entity7 's new leaders must focus on rights under certain circumstances , information regarding top leaders is released to the public only with intent			1
deciding which details to release or not to release on the fallen @entity142 must have been a real headache for the @entity7 leadership			0
when the case against his wife , @entity147 , was first announced , there was no mention of @entity142 himself			0
too many details would only confirm the longstanding public impression that families of high - level party officials use their connections to rapidly accumulate millions and live their private lives in stark contrast to the party 's claims of altruism			1
yet , some details needed to be released , as authorities built their case against him			0
thus , the decision of what and when to release information has seemed painfully slow and cautious , creating the perfect environment for rumors and speculation to feed public curiosity			0
in today 's global information environment , details on the @entity7 leadership can now reach millions of people in a matter of minutes via online media and social networks			2
more than likely , @entity7 leaders do not like the way the public reacts to news that is not carefully crafted by the state 's propaganda machinery			1
in march 2012 , a young man driving a @entity185 with two young women aboard died in a fatal high - speed crash			0
information about the incident went viral online before it could be suppressed			0
the driver was reportedly found to be @entity191 , the son of @entity192 , president @entity59 's protégé , who was demoted six months after the @entity185 incident			1
recently , the @entity196 report of premier @entity198 's alleged family business ventures spread throughout the @entity7 online network shortly after publication , even after @entity7 authorities had blocked access to the newspaper 's @entity203 and @entity7 websites			0
the same happened after @entity205 reported on the wealth of @entity107 's extended family			1
that is a far cry from september 13 , 1971			0
when @entity78 's comrade - in - arms @entity211 died in a mysterious plane crash in @entity213 , it took months for the news to ripple through widening circles of the population			0
thus , the @entity7 leaders ' response to the new age of information has been to make their political system ever more opaque and expend enormous resources on media censorship			1
such is the case with @entity107 , @entity7 's designated leader , of which little is known beyond official accounts			1
his personality too must be kept secret through a web of media censorship , because such information could be used by opponents to figure out his political tendencies and preempt his political actions			2
if we have to make an intelligent guess about @entity107 , we might have to look at the @entity2 's recent " history of the @entity2 , volume 2 ( 1949 - 1978 ) , " which covers the @entity78 years			1
this grand project was led by none other than @entity107 , according to official reports , and reportedly under his sole discretion			2
the result is another @entity2 effort to cosmetically make over the disastrous events of the @entity78 era			0
when @entity107 is in power , he will be turning @entity2 history to its next page			2
" he who controls the past controls the future			0

there are no laws -- or even clear rules -- that govern selection of leaders , @entity251 writes
@entity251 : it is unlikely that public will ever know how @entity107 became @entity59 's designated successor
selection of powerful @entity120 is another top level state secret
@entity251 : public consent is lacking ; in media age , leaders respond by making system more opaque
