the rockets start raining down at her kibbutz usually around late morning			2
that leaves @entity4 precious little time to walk her two dogs and then dash into the shower			1
because when those rockets arrive -- triggering air raid sirens that fill the air with short , shrill howls -- she has to be ready to duck and take cover in her indoor bomb shelter			2
there , all she can do is wait			2
* * * * on the other side of the border , across the security fence in @entity19 , @entity17 has no safe room to run to			1
the fighter jets can come any time , day or night			2
and in this place , one of the most congested on earth , there 's a high probability that if a bomb falls nearby , it might destroy her house , too			1
so , all she can do is pray			2
* * * * this is n't what life was always like for either woman			2
but ever since the long simmering tension between @entity37 and @entity38 flared up this week , rockets and airstrikes have crisscrossed between @entity19 and @entity37			1
neither woman cares for the politics of hate			2
they just want to live a life of peace and safety			2
but the new normal has upended everything -- for them and for those around them fear for daughter 's border wedding one fence , two fates @entity4 lives in @entity56 , a @entity58 community in @entity59 , just over a mile and a half from the border with @entity19			1
the fortified safe room has become the focus of @entity4 's life around the clock			1
" everything is ready to make it easy to run ( to the safe room ) , " she says			1
she has shoved her coffee table , her carpet , anything that blocks her path off to the side , so she can make it there in seconds			2
authorities warn that it takes a rocket just 15 seconds to land after the warning has sounded			2
" it 's not 15 seconds			2
it 's closer to 10 , " she says			2
" sometimes you hear boom and then you run			1
" @entity17 lives in @entity84			1
she 's afraid to use her real name			2
she does n't want her identity published , because she worries someone might misconstrue what she says as political statements , take offense and come after her			2
like @entity4 , the attacks have consumed her , without her wanting it to			1
she sits at home all day			1
when the power goes out , she sits in the dark , listening to sounds of bombs dropping			1
" the sound is very strong , " she says			2
close calls @entity4 is an online trainer			1
she works a lot from home			1
so , unlike many others , she does n't have to step outside much for work , and risk her life every time			2
but there have been close calls			2
since tensions spiked , the kibbutz store has kept minimal hours			2
it 's open for an hour in the morning and one in the afternoon			2
so raemer popped by recently to pick up rations			0
" i ran into the refrigerator room , " she says			1
four rockets have landed within the borders of @entity121 this week			0
she is also afraid of @entity123 digging tunnels underneath the kibbutz and filling them with explosives			0
collateral damage in @entity84 , neighbors poring through the ruins of what were homes has become a familiar sight			0
it happened again on tuesday when @entity37 warplanes flattened a house			1
it belonged to a member of the militant group @entity123 ' military wing			0
and several men were forming a human shield on the roof			0
before most strikes , the @entity37 military makes warning calls , known as a " knock on the roof , " to minimize civilian casualties			0
but , as cramped as @entity84 is , collateral damage is sometimes inevitable			0
seven people died in the tuesday attack , including two boys , ages 10 and 11			0
" in that house lived an old man and his wife and his five sons and their wives and their children and they hid , " said @entity153 , who does n't live too far from @entity17			1
" any @entity38 is a target			0
" when she hears about the deaths -- and she hears about them more and more each day -- @entity17 is overcome with emotion			1
" for the @entity38 , the people of @entity19 , all the people , " she says			1
it 's making everyone around have to get used to dying			1
monitoring news both she and @entity4 obsessively monitor the news			1
" i have three tvs in my house , " @entity4 says			1
" sometimes all three are on			0
" the news these days is depressing , discouraging , dread - inducing			0
more than 130 rockets fired at @entity37 civilians			0
more than 200 airstrikes in @entity19			1
more than two dozen @entity38 dead			0
about 1,000 @entity37 reservists called up for military service			0
and yet , they ca n't tune it out			0
@entity17 's daughter wanted to get out of the house tuesday and go to the university			1
but there were too many explosions outside			0
so she stayed in , with the tv on			0
they only have about six hours of spotty electricity a day , so they often fall back on their battery - powered radio to keep up			0
jittery nerves at @entity121 , every boom or hiss makes @entity4 jump			1
she thinks she and her neighbors have signs of post-traumatic stress			0
she fights it with humor , posting instructions online about how to cook in the middle of a rocket attack			0
run ! @entity205 , cook			1
run ! " she jokes			1
" it takes a lot longer to cook your meal that way			0
" since tuesday , most of the rumbling around her has come from outgoing fire -- @entity37 fire into @entity19			1
those booms and roars come without warning and shake her			0
it 's worse for the children			0
@entity223 and her husband , @entity224 , live in @entity225 , a community next door to @entity121			0
they have two daughters , ages 5 and 2			0
every time a door shuts hard or a loud car goes by , they flinch			0
she tries to keep them busy and takes them to a fortified kindergarten , for summer classes in arts and crafts			0
when sirens scream while they are on the road , she plucks the children from their @entity244 sedan , and ducks and covers with them on the ground			0
her 5 - year - old has caught on to what the sirens mean -- the hissing and crashing sound of rockets , the booms from across the border in @entity19 , shaking their windows			1
so common are the sounds that their parrot has learned to imitate them			0
from her home , @entity259 can see the bombs bursting over @entity19 and fears for parents there			1
" it 's hard not to think about the same situation with little kids over there , " she says			0
before @entity259 hangs up the phone she says that she still needs to get the most important thing off her chest : peace			0
" this is what we want and need for both sides ' sake			0
" staying put it did n't used to be this way			0
@entity4 has lived in @entity56 since 1975			1
she remembers a different time			0
she used to drive to @entity19 in her car			1
a man from @entity19 built her house			1
" they are not my enemies , " she says			0
" i have no doubt they want safety for their children			0
" @entity4 is rooted in the kibbutz			1
her grown son and daughter also live there and have safe houses in their homes			2
but after the first rockets fell , they left for central @entity37			0
@entity4 could have gone , too , but decided to stay back with her dogs			1
she interrupts the phone interview			0
" there was just a boom			0
did you hear it ? " waiting for the war @entity17 ca n't leave even if she wants to			1
the border crossings out of @entity19 are closed			1
" in all the world , there is nowhere like @entity19 , " she says , " a big jail for 2 million people			1
" so , she reads the @entity309 and waits for the war , which she is certain will come			2
another day when night falls , @entity4 hastily brushes her teeth , then hurries to bed in the safe room			1
the fighting heats up at night , and she feels safer in the fortress than in her bed			0
in @entity19 , sleep does n't come easy , @entity17 says			1
children curl up to sleep in their mothers ' laps , too scared to fall unconscious lest the bombs drop			0
when the sun comes up , @entity4 will spend her day running for her life			1
@entity17 will spend it , she says , waiting for death			1
flare - up in @entity37 - @entity38 violence : why now ? has the @entity329 crisis reached a tipping point ? @entity331 exhausted by crises , wars , clashes , upheavals			0

@entity4 is constantly dashing for her safe room , a *bunker* in her house
in @entity19 , @entity17 sits at home in *despair* , feeling sure that a war is coming
she has no place to run and says she has to get used to the idea of dying
