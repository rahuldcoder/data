" people who have said they want to be long are asking ' how much do we really want gold to be part of our portfolios ? ' " @entity26 has enjoyed a stellar run over the past decade			1
prices surged more than sevenfold since 2001 to an all - time high of $ 1,920 a troy ounce in 2011 , as investors turned to the metal as a haven from turmoil in the rest of the financial world			1
but as fears over the eurozone debt crisis recede and investors bet on a recovery in the @entity59 , sentiment towards gold has suffered			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have all called the end of the bull market in recent months			0
" this is a market that has only got one thing on its mind : get me out [ of gold ] , " said @entity65 , head of precious metals at brokerage @entity67			2
the collapse in prices will hurt investors with large gold holdings such as @entity78 , the hedge fund manager who made billions betting against the @entity59 housing market during the financial crisis			1

it is this expectation of global paper currency debasement which makes gold an attractive long - term investment			1
" more than half @entity96 assets are denominated in gold including the great majority of mr @entity78 's own fortune , according to people familiar with the firm			2
@entity127 of @entity128 , the world 's largest bond fund manager , in february described gold as a " decent hedge " " ok , so i made a bad call , " he admitted in a tweet on monday , but added that he " would still buy gold here "			2
in a @entity139 letter to investors , @entity137 listed gold as one of his @entity145 fund 's top five holdings along with stock in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			2
" we took some lumps as gold declined , " he admitted in the letter			0
but mr @entity137 has also been bearish on the yen since 2010 , a position that started to work in the fourth quarter last year and has been one of the most successful hedge fund trades this year			0
