@entity1 @entity0 joined the @entity3 in 2013 as one of the chamber 's most prolific @entity6 users , boasting 1.4 million followers on his personal account			1
but when he got to @entity1 , the @entity11 @entity10 had to start an official account from scratch , with zero followers			2
that 's because congressional ethics rules bar @entity0 and other lawmakers from transferring their personal or campaign followers to their official government @entity6 accounts			1
the prohibition is in place because lawmakers are n't allowed to use office tools for campaign purposes			1
such rules reflect the growing challenge of coming to @entity1 in the digital age			2
elected leaders must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to have the social media presence their constituents demand without getting in trouble			0
video : who teaches the government how to tweet ? to help make sense of it all , @entity6 has invested in a @entity1 - based team to act as a liaison between the company and government entities that use the service			1
the group does n't have any lobbyists or political agenda			2
instead , this five - person contingent , which works with every level of government , from town mayors to the @entity50 , serves the growing network of government entities for which @entity6 has become a part of everyday life			1
on any given day , they walk the halls of @entity57 on their way to teach @entity3 communication directors how to use @entity6 's latest tools , pass through security checks at federal agencies for a seminar with bureaucrats or host meetings at @entity66 or @entity68 headquarters with campaign operatives			1
@entity70 , a political and media veteran who formerly worked for @entity68 sen. @entity73 and @entity74 , leads the group from a small downtown office			0
" our role here is to help elected officials and agencies recognize that they can use the platform to communicate more effectively with constituents and give them ideas on how to do that , " @entity70 said			0
@entity70 was @entity6 's first @entity1 employee in 2010 , when he initially set up shop from his living room			1
at that point , @entity6 had already been around for four years , but only about a quarter of @entity90 used the platform			2
@entity70 's job at the time was spent mostly persuading government agencies and lawmakers to join			1
since then , @entity6 has transformed the way @entity1 does business			1
in a town where information is traded like currency , @entity6 's ability to share and spread a message has made it the first place many turn to break or find news			1
nearly every government agency , from the @entity108 to the @entity109 , relies on the service , which they can use to reach their audience directly			0
as @entity6 's popularity grew throughout government and political circles , the company 's mission here adapted			1
their task shifted from persuading elected leaders to take a risk and try their site to teaching eager policymakers how to use it better			0
@entity6 's high - profile role has had an especially outsized role in reshaping the way @entity90 communicates with the media and constituents			1
in the weeks leading up to president @entity129 's recent @entity131 address , @entity6 's d.c. team was busy encouraging lawmakers to live - tweet their experience during the proceedings by posting their reactions , photos and videos using @entity138 , a camera app twitter acquired in 2012			1
the pitch to members : why wait for a television camera to find you when you can broadcast your personal response to the @entity145 in seconds ? the campaign paid off			0
within minutes of @entity129 's remarks , congressional staffers and even lawmakers themselves pulled out smartphones to shoot brief videos throughout @entity153 â€” the room outside the @entity50 chamber that doubled as a media spin room after @entity129 's address -- of their bosses rebutting or praising the president 's proposals			2
the @entity161 even set up a rapid response station to help automate the process for lawmakers who needed some extra help			0
" we 're moving toward a situation where members are letting people into the process and viewing it through their own eyes , which is a lot closer , " said @entity166 , a former @entity167 staffer who joined @entity6 's government team in 2012			1
" you 're seeing more members involved personally , and it brings a lot more people into the process			0
" @entity70 's team last year produced a handbook for policymakers on how best to use the platform , which along with security guidelines , recommends that policymakers use their accounts themselves to share photos and information about their lives and work			0
( @entity6 is aiming to compete on photo - sharing with @entity194 - owned app @entity192 , which is currently dominating the online photo market			2
) of course , over-sharing can backfire			0
a website maintained by the watchdog @entity198 called " @entity204 " that tracks posts deleted by politicians serves as a graveyard of congressional digital mishaps			0
in january , freshman @entity205 rep. @entity205 of @entity206 tweeted photos from the @entity50 floor in violation of chamber rules that bar photography			0
he deleted them soon after			0
last summer , several lawmakers removed tweets of praise for the release of hostage sgt. @entity217 once details of how the @entity129 administration handled the negotiations became known			0
still , @entity6 's @entity222 reps hold that the opportunity to connect directly with constituents is well worth the risk			1
" the best members of @entity90 who use @entity6 are the ones who are using it themselves and using it in an authentic way , " @entity70 said			2
" it 's not something to be afraid of			0
opening this new gateway for that direct one - on - one communication gateway with constituents is something we have n't had in a long time			0

@entity6 's @entity1 staff promotes tweeting to governments around the world .
they do n't lobby ; they teach lawmakers and government agencies how to use @entity6 's latest tools
