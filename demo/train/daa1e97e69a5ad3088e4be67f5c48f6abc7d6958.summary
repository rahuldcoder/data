awkward actor - singer chin grabs			2
and who could forget the belly grab - cheek smooch that rocked the @entity5 ? it 's enough to make you ask : what in the world has happened to personal space ? or , in the case of the @entity5 , you make fun			1
there 's @entity14 kissing not actress @entity15 -- as in the original incident from sunday 's @entity17 -- but @entity19 president @entity18 , @entity21 's supreme leader @entity20 or the @entity22			1
then there 's @entity14 holding " @entity26 " star @entity25 's chin and being urged to " let her go ... let her go ! " " today 's word			1
# @entity14 - ( verb ) - to touch ( meaning ) - for example , i like to travolta your cheeks , " @entity30 user @ @entity31 wrote tuesday			1
of course , invasions of personal space are n't anything new			1
it 's been more than 20 years since " seinfeld " brought us the " close talker , " and it was old news even then			2
but all the jokes aside -- and there were plenty -- there is a serious side to this			2
take a look at these photos , and a theme emerges			2
there 's @entity14 grabbing @entity15 , who received an even more invasive grab at the 2006 @entity57 , when designer @entity58 actually grabbed her breast on the red carpet while checking out the construction of her dress			1
then there 's @entity64 gripping the shoulders of @entity66 , the wife of the new @entity68 defense secretary , last week			1
that image evoked memories of former president @entity72 's awkward shoulder massage of @entity74 chancellor @entity73 at the 2006 @entity75			2
though the notion of cultural space varies with culture , @entity68 are undisputed champions for a large personal zone , argues @entity81 , @entity83 psychology professor @entity82			1
and although they make might for laughs by violating the unspoken rules of personal space in such egregious ways , @entity14 , @entity64 and others are demonstrating a cultural disregard for women , she said			1
" breaking those zones shows a lack of respect , " she said			0
" it 's a way of showing your power			0
" do n't argue that it happens to everyone , columnist @entity97 wrote in the @entity100			0
" even though it happens to some males sometimes , it happens to females all the time , " she said			0
" try to imagine the @entity106 situation with the roles reversed -- @entity66 gripping @entity64 's shoulders ; or , to even things up , @entity110 or @entity73 doing the grabbing and whispering , " she said			1
" it 's implausible to say the least			0
" the power plays do happen among men but take on a different cast			0
there 's a whole field of research into the " power handshake " -- who stands where and does what -- that elevates a simple , quiet greeting into proxy chest thumping			0
and then there 's trying to escape when one latches on a party , author @entity127 wrote in the @entity130 this week			0
" there 's a particular breed of alpha who displays his credentials by standing unnervingly close to you , his face just a few inches from yours , eye contact maintained for what seems like centuries , " he wrote			0
" some of them even avoid blinking , " he said			0
" @entity145 is that just how it feels ? "			0

personal space *gaffes* by @entity14 , vice president @entity64 make for new memes
but the incidents belie a more serious *message* , a psychologist says
