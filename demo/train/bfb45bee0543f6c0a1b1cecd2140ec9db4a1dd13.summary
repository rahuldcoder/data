@entity2 has a room barely wider than a single bed			0
@entity5 has left his one - year - old son thousands of miles away to " make it " in @entity9 's capital			2
together they are members of what the @entity9 press unkindly refer to as the " rat tribe " -- people who live underground in a warren of basements and air raid shelters in @entity17			1
usually migrant workers , they ca n't afford private housing and , without the official resident permit known as the " hukou " they have no access to low - cost government housing , so they find themselves living underground			1
estimates suggest there may be more than one million people living underneath the @entity9 capital			2
photographer @entity29 has been documenting their lives for the past five years			1
" i had a hunch that they were just normal people , " she says			0
" they are actually pretty funky people , most of them are kind of young and all of them have aspirations to move up the social mobility ladder			0
" @entity29 said subterranean living is not as squalid as it might sound			2
some use dehumidifiers in summer to take away the damp and in @entity17 's freezing winter months it 's warmer than above ground homes			1
" the living space might seem pretty pathetic to us and maybe i went in with this pitying attitude as well , but what i found was the people make the best of their lives down there			0
" @entity51 , a professor at the @entity52 , has mapped @entity17 's underground city by studying more than 7,000 online rental ads. she found the median size was 9.75 square meters , or 105 square feet , and the mean rent was $ 70 a month -- although she believes the rentals she studied were at the higher end of what 's available			1
@entity51 says it 's hard to know exactly how many people live in this type of informal housing			1
estimates vary from 200,000 to 2 million			0
she says 1 million is a reasonable estimate			0
all buildings constructed in @entity17 are required to have basements -- initially a national defense policy that began in the 1950s -- and until 2010 it was perfectly legal to live in these spaces as long as they met building codes			1
however , the official policy is now to evict people , but it 's not being implemented evenly , @entity51 says			0
the number of rental ads for underground housing increased during her year researching the phenomena in 2013			2
alternative low - cost options include living in " urban villages " on @entity17 's outskirts			1
but @entity51 says : " they would rather live underground than commute for a long time			1
it means that sometimes they could have two jobs			0
" @entity51 found the " rat tribe " had little interaction with those living above them			0
" the people above ground preferred to be as separate as possible and that built up fear of who these people are			0
" @entity0 , the pedicurist , was the first person @entity29 befriended and photographed			2
after years spent living beneath a posh condominium in east @entity17 , she has since moved " above ground			1
" " she is one of the success stories , " says @entity29			2
" i think for some people there is true upward mobility but for many people the hukou system , whereby migrants ca n't actually buy homes and settle down , is still a huge barrier to them building lives and families here			1
" " most think they will eventually go home and maybe set up a shop and raise their families			0
" @entity1 's @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report			0

it 's estimated that one million live underground in @entity17
they *'re* mainly migrant workers , who ca n't afford private housing
photographer @entity29 spent five years documenting their lives
