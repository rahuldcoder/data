-- @entity1 smashed five goals past @entity3 to return to the top of the @entity6 league after briefly being deposed by rivals @entity7			1
the score flattered @entity1 , who scored a flurry of second half goals late on after a brave @entity3 effort had threatened an upset			1
@entity14 returned to the starting line up to score within the first ten minutes and when @entity16 added a second a heavy defeat was on the cards			0
but @entity3 's @entity19 made the most of a horrific defensive mix up to pull a goal back before half time			1
but @entity1 eventually imposed their superiority on the game , with @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 completing the scoring			1
it was the tenth game in a row that @entity27 has scored			2
it was also the fifth time in eight league games that @entity1 have scored five goals			1
@entity34 arrives ? meanwhile @entity34 came off the bench to set up two goals , save @entity7 's blushes and see the @entity39 side briefly go top of the league			1
@entity7 had traveled to @entity42 with question marks hanging over @entity45 's team			1
a two game losing streak was followed by an unconvincing 2 - 0 victory over @entity48 in the @entity49			1
the returning @entity50 , signed in the summer but banned until last month after biting a player at the @entity53 finals , had been far from his best too			0
@entity34 started on the bench and @entity7 went into half time a goal down after @entity57 took advantage of a @entity60 mistake to fire @entity42 into the lead but @entity34 and @entity62 were called into action in the second half which changed the shape of the game			1
the two combined midway through the second half to bring the sides level before @entity34 's cross set up @entity69 in the 81st minute to score the winner			2
but coach @entity45 was far from happy			0
" the second half was better for the ambition and attitude shown by the players rather than for good football , " he said after the game			2
" to have a good season , though , you have to win even when you do n't play well in games like today			0
" @entity79 thrive , @entity81 dive in @entity82 , @entity79 continued their imperious form by beating @entity84 4 - 0 thanks to a @entity87 hat trick			2
the victory saw @entity79 go seven points clear at the top of the league , handing coach @entity92 his eight victory in eleven league games			2
" they were very aggressive in defense , we had a few problems with our structure , " @entity92 told @entity95 after the game			0
" but the last 20 minutes was a completely different game			0
" @entity79 's supremacy is no surprise to anyone , but the identity of the team propping up the league is			0
@entity109 's @entity81 qualified for the knock out phase of the @entity49 last week , but results on saturday saw @entity81 fall to the foot of the table , the first time they have been in such a lowly position for seven years			0
@entity81 has lost five league games in a row			0
