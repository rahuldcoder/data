-- a militant @entity3 group associated with @entity4 has for the first time threatened to attack @entity5 , far from its normal base of operations in @entity8			1
@entity9 , which is fighting to control the east @entity11 country , accused @entity5 of " starting to destroy " the @entity12 , where standoffs have taken place recently between @entity5 police and @entity16			1
the mosque is part of the complex that @entity20 call the @entity21 and @entity22 call @entity21			0
" the @entity20 started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of @entity12 and they routinely kill our @entity16 brothers , so we are committed to defend our @entity16 brothers , " said @entity23 , a prominent @entity9 commander			1
his threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after friday prayers in @entity34 in southwest @entity8			2
@entity9 controls the region , which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years			2
other leaders of the group also threatened @entity5 , the first time the group is known to have done so			2
" we will transfer and expand our fighting in the @entity45 so we can defend @entity12 from the @entity5 , " @entity9 commander @entity42 said in @entity43 , the @entity8 capital			1
he is apparently the leader of a new @entity9 armed group calling themselves " @entity47 , " or " @entity48 , " which they said is assigned to attack @entity5			1
it is not clear whether @entity9 has the capacity to carry out its threats against @entity5			1
but @entity52 of the @entity53 , speaking last week before @entity9 issued its threats against @entity5 , warned that the group should be taken seriously			1
" we should not underestimate the capacity of @entity9 , " he said			1
" this is a deadly organization , a formidable foe			0
" @entity52 said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like @entity4 , which was behind the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity63			0
" if you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the web sites , if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak , it is completely indistinguishable from @entity4 leaders , " @entity52 said			0
the group has also become more vicious in @entity8 , a local human rights expert said			2
" the most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by @entity9 , " activist @entity74 said			2
" they have also instilled fear			0
they just shoot , they kill , they maim and they lash			0
" the group also threatened @entity11 neighbors on friday , including @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			0
they have in the past threatened @entity11 nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war - torn country			0
the @entity96 from april lists @entity9 as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside @entity8			1
it does not list the group as having carried out violence outside @entity8 , but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside @entity4 in @entity104			0
@entity8 has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator @entity107 and sparked brutal clan infighting			1
the transitional government has struggled to establish authority , challenged by @entity3 groups like @entity9 that have seized control of @entity43 and much of the south			0
@entity0 's @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity87 , contributed to this report .			0
