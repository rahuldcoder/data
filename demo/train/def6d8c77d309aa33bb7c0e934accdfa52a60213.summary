-- how annoying and frustrating have calls from telemarketers , and robocalls pitching useless and sometimes fraudulent services , become ? how much daily irritation in millions of @entity7 households have the endless calls been causing ? enough that the federal government , this month , offered a $ 50,000 cash reward to the citizen who comes up with the best technical solution for blocking illegal commercial robocalls on landlines and mobile phones			1
in announcing the reward , @entity16 , director of the @entity18 's @entity17 , said that the person who devises a way to get rid of the calls " will become a national hero			1
" the robocalls , aggressively attempting to sell unasked - for products and services to people who are quietly sitting around their homes , are like cockroaches : irritating , despised , always multiplying , seemingly indestructible and undefeatable			1
not that no one is trying			0
according to the @entity18 , " during the last two years the @entity18 has stopped companies responsible for billions of robocalls that offered everything from fraudulent credit card services and so - called auto warranty protection to grant procurement programs			1
but the number of robocall complaints continues to rise as new technologies enable telemarketers to auto - dial thousands of phone calls every minute that display false or misleading caller id information for an incredibly low cost			1
" sen. @entity45 , @entity47 - @entity46 , in proposing legislation that would dramatically increase the penalties for making harassing telemarketing calls to people 's homes , has said : " a family has the right to get through dinner without constantly being interrupted by phone calls from mortgage companies , credit card firms or , even worse , scammers			1
" @entity45 has proposed fining telemarketers $ 20,000 each time a call is made to a phone number whose owner has registered it with a do - not - call list			0
( telemarketing calls and robocalls to landlines on behalf of political candidates , by the way , are permitted under federal regulations ; some states have passed their own laws in an effort to restrict those political calls			2
) the federal @entity76 , which was instituted in 2003 , has , on paper , been a remarkable success			0
according to the @entity18 , more than 217 million telephone numbers are on the registry			1
but complaints about unwanted marketing calls continue to go up			2
last year , more than 3.8 million people filed formal complaints about receiving telemarketing calls and commercial robocalls			1
i spoke with the @entity18 's point person on robocalls and harassing telemarketing calls : @entity91 , the director of the agency 's @entity92 in the @entity17			1
she said the robocalls , including ones initiated by criminal scammers , are proliferating because " it 's becoming cheaper and cheaper to do this ( automated ) voice blasting			2
" the reason that families who have listed their telephone numbers with the @entity76 continue to receive the marketing calls , she said , is that " the people sending out the calls are acting illegally , and they have no intention of complying with the law			2
" she made a distinction between legitimate companies who do telephone marketing and heed the @entity76 , and firms that do not : " fraudulent telemarketers never were going to comply			0
" ( this raises the question of why it should be up to individuals and families to register on a do - not - call list : is there anyone in this country who actually enjoys hearing from strangers on the telephone trying to sell them things ? who eagerly awaits unsolicited calls seeking money and personal information ? ) @entity91 said that " enormous law - enforcement focus " is being given to the fraudulent telemarketers			2
i asked her if there really were enough people answering their phones and giving money to the robocall companies to make it worth the telemarketers ' efforts : do these companies make significant profits ? " they would n't be doing it if they did n't , " she said			2
" they are n't in the business of charity			0
" she said that the cockroach analogy did n't go far enough : " this is n't just a nuisance			0
this is economic injury to the people being duped			0
" i asked her if she -- the federal official who spends her days working against the robocallers -- receives the calls at her own home			0
" yes , " she said			0
and , she said , not only at her home : she receives them on her government - issued cell phone			0
which raises an intriguing , if unlikely , scenario : maybe if the seemingly unstoppable robocalls somehow made it through to a residence at @entity166 in @entity167 , the annoyance and anger that accompany them might be what it would take to finally start the demise of the scam callers			0
remember that political ad of @entity175 's , about a phone ringing in the @entity166 at 3 a.m. ? what if the president were to pick up that ringing telephone in the middle of the night , and be greeted by an automated voice asking him if he 'd like to lower his mortgage rates ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 : telemarketers , robocalls so irritating that @entity18 has offered cash for solution
the @entity18 says it 's *stemmed* robocall scams , but robocalls still on rise , a *scourge* of home life
last year , more than 3.8 million people filed formal complaints about them , says @entity186
@entity186 : if the president got calls from *obnoxious* telemarketers , maybe they 'd be ended
