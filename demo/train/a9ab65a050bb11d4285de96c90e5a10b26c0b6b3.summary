-- this last week has been chock full of gaffes by our presidential candidates -- a veritable gaffe - a - thon , a gaffe - a - palooza			1
president @entity5 and the @entity7 presidential candidates almost seem to be trying to one - up each other 's blunders			1
this " @entity11 " started off slowly enough last monday with a small one by @entity10 : " i do n't care what the unemployment rate is going to be			0
it does n't matter to me			0
" but then , just days later , the gaffes started flying fast and furious			1
on wednesday , @entity17 's communication director @entity16 told @entity0 that he was n't concerned if @entity17 was moving to the right on certain key issues during the @entity7 primaries because , as he put it : " you hit a reset button for the fall campaign			1
... it 's almost like an @entity25			1
" only a few hours later , @entity10 , armed with an @entity25 , commented that if voters are offered a choice between president @entity5 and @entity17 in this november 's election : " we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk with what may be the @entity25 candidate for the future			1
" and then president @entity5 joined in			0
on sunday , unaware that his microphone was on while he was speaking to @entity37 president @entity36 about missile defense treaty negotiations , commented : " this is my last election			0
after my election i have more flexibility			0
" if you were a staff member of any of these campaigns , you must have consumed an industrial size bottle of @entity44 over the last few days			2
but for the rest of us in @entity48 , these moments are great -- it 's just what we need to accurately assess our candidates			1
let 's be honest , these comments were not " gaffes " as the media dubs them , but rather , rare opportunities for us to have an unfiltered look at the candidates ' character and views on issues			1
a gaffe is defined as a mistake : a misstatement of fact , a mispronunciation of a word , a social faux pas			0
by way of example , president @entity5 made a classic gaffe by stating a few years ago that he had campaigned in all " 57 states , " when obviously he meant to say 50 states			0
another gaffe occurred when president @entity5 was in @entity76 and commented : " i do n't know what the term is in @entity76 " for " wheeling and dealing			0
" the gaffe being that there is no @entity76 language			0
and , of course , @entity81 was the gaffe - anator			0
my favorites were his coining of new words like " misunderstimate " or saying , while at an event with the queen of @entity92 , that she first visited the @entity48 in 1776			0
the so - called gaffes in this campaign are not misstatements of facts or mispronunciations			2
when the words at issue were uttered , they accurately communicated the candidates ' views			2
the reason the statements were later labeled mistakes , and not at all what the candidate meant , was because of the ensuing firestorm of criticism in the media			0
but what do you think is a more accurate gauge of who a candidate truly is as a person : his or her prepared stump speeches delivered over months or a candid , unrehearsed comment on an issue ? the answers at the debates , which are regurgitated to us like a bird feeding its baby , or a spontaneous moment when the candidate speaks his mind ? there is not doubt that president @entity5 meant what he said to the @entity37 president			2
just as @entity17 did with his past gaffes like " corporations are people " and " i like being able to fire people who provide services to me			2
" and does anyone question that @entity10 was n't being sincere when he remarked that after reading @entity139 's 1960 famous speech about the need to have a clear line between church and state , it almost made @entity10 want " to throw up " ? of course he meant this -- after all , this is the same @entity10 who has repeatedly stated on the campaign trail that our civil laws and the @entity150 must be in agreement			2
these rare , honest moments during the campaign should not be so quickly dismissed by the media or us as simply gaffes			1
these comments arguably paint a more accurate portrait of the candidate than any prepared speech they can offer us			1
indeed , we should applaud and savor these gaffes , because it 's these very remarks that may ultimately help us decide if the candidate in question is truly the best suited to be elected or re-elected as president of the @entity48			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 : candidates , campaigns have been making lots of gaffes lately
he says candidates quickly *backpedal* from gaffes , but the *public* knows better
he says these comments are less gaffes than accurate reads of a candidates *viewpoints*
@entity171 : we should applaud gaffes as a chance to see who 's suited for the job
