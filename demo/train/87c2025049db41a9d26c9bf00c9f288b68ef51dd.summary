@entity0 , @entity1 -- extreme heat in major @entity5 cities this week signals more than the arrival of the dog days of summer			1
city dwellers have long endured hot summer afternoons , but the frequency of extremely hot days -- when admissions to hospital emergency rooms for heat - related illnesses spike -- has increased substantially over the past several decades			1
an analysis of weather records at @entity16 reveals that the average number of heat - wave days in large @entity5 cities each year had increased from nine in the mid- 1950s to 19 by the mid- 2000s			1
the news is even worse for the country 's most sprawling cities , such as @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity22 , @entity23 ; and @entity24 , @entity25 : the number of heat - wave days in these cities has nearly tripled during the same time			1
there are two reasons for the increase in urban areas			0
first , temperatures in cities are rising because of the global greenhouse effect , which is intensifying as the vehicles we drive and the energy we consume emit more and more greenhouse gases			1
second , and more important , cities are warming because of the loss of trees and other natural land cover to make way for buildings , streets , and parking lots , which are composed of materials that absorb far more thermal radiation than the natural landscape			2
because of these two effects -- one global , the other local -- most large @entity5 cities are warming at more than twice the rate of their outlying rural areas and the planet as a whole , and this accelerated pace is at the root of the increasing frequency of heat waves			1
much more than a source of discomfort , the growing frequency of heat waves in cities poses a significant public health threat			1
this was made clear by an intense and prolonged heat wave in @entity69 during the summer of 2003 , when it 's estimated more than 70,000 residents of @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and other nations died from exposure to extreme heat			2
the majority of people who died lived in cities			0
with a death toll exceeding that of any other weather - related natural disaster in the developed world -- including hurricanes , tornadoes and floods -- the @entity69 heat wave attests to the growing risk of climate - related health threats , even in the most affluent and medically advanced societies			2
yet the global response to this climate event -- one that reveals more about the profoundly changing environment in which we live than any other yet endured -- has largely been one of indifference			0
less than a decade after the deadly heat wave , many outside of @entity69 do not even recall hearing of it			0
and fewer appreciate its central lesson : the extremity of the heat was greatly amplified and so made more dangerous by the cities themselves			0
so , as cities prepare over the coming days for the potential health impacts of a heat wave , it is imperative that urban governments look ahead and take aggressive action over the coming years to address the root causes of rising temperatures in cities			2
the good news is that cities do n't have to wait for the @entity121 or the global community to adopt highly effective programs			0
programs already under way in @entity126 , @entity127 and other cities to plant millions of trees can measurably cool the air and dampen the extremity of heat waves over time			1
the preservation and restoration of greenspaces within and around urban areas are a critical first line of defense against climate change			0
coupled with enhancing greenspace is the need to make built surfaces more highly reflective , to offset the absorption of solar energy			0
the use of lightly hued or whitewashed roofing and paving materials , as found in @entity149 cities , is a proven tool for moderating summer temperatures			0
finally , a long - term transition from sprawl and highways toward more compact urban development , featuring walkable neighborhoods and transit systems , can reduce the emission of waste heat from vehicles and buildings			1
this summer shows climate change is neither a theoretical problem nor one to be addressed by future generations : it is on display this week in major @entity5 cities			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : number of heat - wave days in @entity5 cities has *doubled* since 1950s
@entity171 says greenhouse effect , loss of trees and grass in *cityscape* are to blame
frequency of heat waves in cities a significant public health threat , he writes
he urges planting greenery , making city surfaces reflective , better transit systems
