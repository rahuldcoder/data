-- @entity1 struck @entity2 , @entity3 , in such a disturbing way that the nation still struggles with its impact a year later			1
the legacy of the second - deadliest mass shooting in @entity10 history is so profound that it can not hold just one meaning			2
that 's because the crime itself conveys multiple issues in its summary : a mentally ill 20 - year - old recluse obsessed with school shootings enters @entity20 after the morning bell and kills six adult women , 12 girls and eight boys in 11 minutes			1
the children were 6 or 7 years old			1
the heavily armed @entity26 , who first killed his mother before taking her car to the school , also killed himself , in a classroom			1
on the anniversary of the december 14 slaughter -- under the shadow of another school shooting , this time at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 -- country and community alike pause and reflect on an event known simply as " @entity2 " or " @entity20 " and what it says about @entity10 on the matters of guns , mental health , healing , and the human spirit			1
guns whether the @entity10 has reformed its gun laws after the @entity2 massacre may depend on your point of view			1
clearly , @entity10 affirms a right to bear arms			0
president @entity55 was unable to persuade @entity56 , as he vowed in @entity2 's aftermath , to " come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics " about gun reform			1
@entity55 failed to even expand background checks on firearm buyers , though he signed 23 executive actions to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety			1
however , @entity70 , author of " @entity71 : the @entity75 , " said it 's easier today to own a firearm in some states than a year ago			1
" the one - word answer is yes , " @entity70 , an assistant managing editor and senior writer at @entity77 , told @entity78			0
" and i say yes because i think the overall environment in the @entity10 has moved in a libertarian direction , in a pro-gun direction , away from the idea that the regulation of the lawful acquisition of firearms has much effect on crime			0
" others disagree and point to how a growing number of states have reformed gun laws -- in the absence of the federal reforms			1
@entity70 acknowledges the success in those states , indicating it 's not easier to own and operate a gun in those regions a year after @entity20			1
those are major victories , according to gun reform advocates who have spent years working on their cause			1
those activists assembled this month a report card on all 50 states , grading their regulations on guns and ammunition , background checks , and prohibitions against dangerous people buying weapons			2
high grades went to eight states that have enacted major gun reforms : @entity119 , @entity35 , @entity3 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
low grades were given to @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 -- states with some of the highest gun death rates in the country , according to the @entity133 and the @entity134			1
" states have clearly led where @entity56 has failed , and passed gun measures that will save lives , " @entity135 , president of the @entity134 , said in a statement			1
" but to make this the truly safer nation we all want , we need the same laws on a federal level			1
" @entity2 marks the anniversary @entity147 @entity26 , 20 , suffered mental health problems			1
many people , including the parents whose children were killed by @entity26 , say society needs to better treat these problems to prevent another disturbed gunman committing a massacre			1
in fact , to combat the stigma - loaded phrase of " mental illness , " some @entity2 parents have advanced a new wording to illustrate how the issue is deeper or more organic : " brain health " or " brain illness			1
" @entity26 was living with his mother , @entity165 , 52 , in a @entity2 house that evoked the old - growth elegance of @entity168			0
she ensured her son received treatment , but after her son 's rampage , she was criticized by some for owning a semiautomatic rifle and two handguns , a @entity71 and a @entity176 , and giving her son access to them			2
@entity26 took those firearms to @entity20 and used a @entity182 - @entity181 rifle in the shooting			2
before the violence , @entity26 had become isolated			0
his parents divorced in september 2009 , and his father , @entity186 , remarried and moved to an area not far from @entity2			0
their only other child , also a son , 24 , was n't living in the mother 's home			2
a 44 - page summary of @entity3 authorities ' investigation concludes that @entity26 " had significant mental health issues that affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact with others			1
what contribution this made to the shootings , if any , is unknown as those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior			1
" some @entity2 parents and a journalist who wrote a book about the town 's atrocity take exception with that finding			1
they are raising public awareness about mental -- or brain -- health issues as a way to prevent catastrophic crimes and to honor the memory of the children who were slain			1
@entity20 arranged help for her son in school , but once he left school at age 18 and became socially isolated , the mother 's options became limited , said journalist @entity226 , author of " @entity2 : an @entity227			1
" why she kept guns in the home , however , is " inexplicable , " he said			0
" when i tracked through @entity26 's life -- and i was able to access years ' worth of @entity20 , the mother 's , e-mails -- you can see this deterioration of mental health over the course of many years			1
and this was a mother who identified that her son was mentally ill and sought professional help , " @entity226 said			0
" still , @entity26 was not on medication			0
and the fact that we have a lot of dangerously mentally ill people around who are not being treated , to me says that you can expect this rising trend of mass shootings to continue unless we figure out a solution			0
" the parents of @entity2 are urging society to make treatment of brain illnesses an affirmative experience , not a stigmatizing one			2
" the @entity20 shooting could have been avoided if the proper intervention had been made , if he and his family had received help , had sought help and had received help at an earlier stage , " said @entity256 , whose son @entity257 , 6 , was killed in the gunfire			1
" and certainly if there had n't been that sort of open access to firearms , i probably would n't be sitting here talking to you today , and to be honest that would be a really good thing , " @entity256 said last week			0
after @entity2 , mental health gains prominence in gun debate the victimized families families who lost a child in the mass shooting still recover from the devastation			1
they are just now beginning to share with the world the depth of the tragedy			0
public comments by the families this weekend are unlikely , as several news outlets , including @entity0 , have agreed not to send reporters to @entity2 on the anniversary			2
" i had to be on the floor because i felt if i stood up the world would spin away			0
i remember asking , why would somebody walk into the school and kill my child , " @entity292 said in a recent interview			2
she and @entity297 lost 6 - year - old daughter @entity20 in the shooting			1
" i think there 's not a minute , not a second of any day that goes by where somewhere in my head i 'm thinking , i do n't have my daughter @entity304			2
that 's always in my head , " said @entity297			2
@entity306 and @entity307 also spoke of falling into an abyss			0
their son , @entity309 , 7 , was also killed			2
" i still really ca n't seem to get my head around that this has happened and how final it is , " @entity307 said			0
added her husband : " the bottom just falls out for you			0
what 's left is faith			0
" @entity292 and @entity297 are both research scientists			0
he studies neuroscience and neuropsychopharmacology			0
to seek something constructive in a situation so destructive , the couple started a foundation in the name of their daughter , devoted to understanding the biological and environmental factors that can lead to malevolent behavior			0
" we do think that there are physical manifestations in the brain that lead to all our behaviors , " @entity297 said			0
" and if we can understand those , we can help nudge them one direction or another to make things happier and healthier			0
" opinion : keep your guns , but take responsibility the community itself after much soul searching , the hamlet of @entity2 decided to tear down the school , whose razing began in october			0
another big decision had to be made : should the new school be built in the same place or another ? the residents would not be bowed : the new school will be built on the same site , a symbol of resurrection			2
it was n't an easy choice in a town of 27,000 where everyone seems to have some sort of connection -- close or loose -- to the school and its carnage			2
should children return to that scene , even if a new school would greet them ? " it was gut wrenching , " said @entity370 , a community building expert who helped a 28 - person task force in @entity2 come to a decision			2
" this was really about how the community was going to move forward and under what conditions and how you were going to balance the needs of the current students and those of future generations , " @entity370 said			0
" there was the question of building on another site and whether that was giving into evil of the gunman			0
" public testimony showed divisions , said @entity370 , who is president of an institute for public innovation bearing his name			0
" families for victims or survivors would speak before the task force , " he said			0
" they would say something that i would n't want to have to be in your shoes making this decision , and even though i do n't agree with your decision , i would be supportive			0
" perhaps it 's these public legacies that are the greatest : @entity408 shows compassion in its darkest hour			1
and a community moves forward the best it can , recognizing , as @entity370 said , that there 's " not a perfect solution to an imperfect , horrific situation			0
" what really makes schools safer ?			0

a @entity3 school shooting killed six women and 20 children , ages 6 or 7 , a year ago
federal gun reform *proposals* fail , but some states now have *tougher* gun laws
mental health problems are now being cast as " brain health " issues in a public campaign
a town 's compassion is tested when deciding to build a new school on the same site
