-- president @entity1 and @entity3 presidential nominee @entity2 went head - to - head on @entity5 , taxes , and jobs on wednesday as the two campaigned throughout @entity9			1
both sought to illustrate what the next four years would be like under their leadership as new polls indicated @entity1 exceeding 50 % support among likely voters in @entity9 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
those are all swing states that combined will account for nearly a quarter of the electoral votes needed to win the @entity20			1
surveys suggest that @entity2 has lost his edge on the economy , the centerpiece of his campaign to highlight slow growth , trade tensions , and stubbornly high unemployment under @entity1 's leadership			1
the economy remains the top issue for @entity32 as well when it comes to their vote for president , but @entity2 says he 's not worried about the new surveys			1
" polls go up and down , but frankly you 're going to see the support that i need to become president on @entity43 , " @entity2 said in an interview with @entity0 national political correspondent @entity38			2

@entity2 's campaign released a new ad saying @entity1 's policies are n't working for most @entity32 and told a crowd near @entity58 that there is a right way and a wrong way toward economic progress			1
" i know what it takes to get this economy going again			0
i care about the people of @entity32 , " @entity2 said			2
" and the difference between me and president @entity1 is i know what to do and i will do what it takes to get this economy going			2
" at the @entity74 plant in @entity75 , @entity2 took a hard line against @entity5 over currency manipulation , saying it has pushed @entity32 jobs overseas			1
he said , as president , he would adopt policies favorable to manufacturing in response to lost employment			0

they must not steal jobs in an unfair way			0

@entity9 is a manufacturing center for auto parts			0
industry research shows that 800,000 jobs in @entity9 are tied to the auto industry , which also has railed against @entity5 currency policies			1
@entity1 said his opponent 's rhetoric on @entity5 was disingenuous			1
" he says he 's gon na take the fight to them , he 's going to go after these cheaters , and i 've got to admit , that message is better than what he has actually done about this thing , " @entity1 said at @entity106			0
" it sounds better than talking about all the years he spent profiting from companies that sent our jobs to @entity5			0
the candidates also diverged on tax policy and the deficit			0
@entity1 vs. @entity2 : how they 'd handle the $ 7 trillion fiscal cliff @entity1 said @entity2 's economic policies - trickle down economics - would not work			1
instead , @entity1 said he wanted to grow the economy " from the middle out , " not the top down , to chip away at the budget deficit			2
" i want to keep taxes low for middle class families and working class families , but if we want to close the deficit , we have to ask people like me to spend a little bit more , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 won @entity9 by five points in 2008 , but the @entity3 answered back big in the 2010 midterm elections and took back the governor 's office and five @entity20 seats held by @entity142			1
