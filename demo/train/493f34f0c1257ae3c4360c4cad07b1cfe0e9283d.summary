-- it 's been a busy few days in the world of cybercrime			2
late last week , we learned that cooperation between the @entity6 and overseas police agencies led to the dissection of the amorphous network behind @entity10 -- the tool that allows hackers to remotely access an unwitting user 's computer to steal sensitive files , log passwords , and capture webcam images			1
law enforcement authorities from the @entity19 to @entity20 to the @entity21 appeared on the doorsteps of suspected hackers with links to the malicious software , eventually arresting 90 people and gathering hoards of evidence along the way			1
then , on monday , @entity19 attorney general @entity30 released an indictment for five @entity33 nationals on charges of corporate cybertheft			1
in a statement , fbi director @entity36 accused the @entity33 government of committing " cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state - owned industries			1
" the 31 - count cybertheft indictment is the first of its kind to level penalties on a state actor -- in this case five members of the @entity48 -- for allegedly pilfering intellectual property from six @entity19 companies			0
predictably , @entity33 's @entity52 was quick to rebuke the charges as " fabricated " and a violation " of basic norms of international relations			1
" as if it had been pre-written , the scripted statement then touted @entity33 's record as a " staunch defender of cybersecurity			1
" practically speaking , the arrest of 90 semi-amateur hackers is hardly a decisive blow to global cybercrime and the @entity66 's indictment is little more than a legal show of force			2
after all , the @entity10 network pales in comparison to other high - dealing cybercrime rings and @entity33 has already dismissed the allegations as " fictitious and absurd , " so do n't expect extradition proceedings anytime soon			1
but the @entity10 arrests and the @entity66 allegations against @entity33 , although modest , are hardly trivial			1
the indictment marks the most flagrant expression of the @entity19 ' growing intolerance for corporate cybertheft to date			0
it also communicates to @entity33 and the rest of the world the degree to which such behavior directly threatens @entity19 's interests , perhaps even in a manner commensurate with more conventional threats like terrorism and wmd proliferation			2
more than signaling intolerance for cybercrime , both cases have revealed domestic and foreign law enforcement 's steady maturation in this space			1
the international @entity10 raid , which spanned 19 countries , required robust information sharing channels and cross-border operational coordination			1
on the surface , such partnerships seem routine given that the @entity19 regularly partners with foreign law enforcement on drug , terrorism , and financial crimes			1
but unlike other criminal disciplines , there are no universally - recognized charters governing international norms for cybercrime , and most countries ' justice systems are at drastically different stages of development in this nascent legal field			2
the @entity118 and their international counterparts deserve a solid pat on the back for this one , but the progress will quickly retreat if the events of the past week do n't trigger a more enduring dialogue on international norms for cybercrime			0
now more than ever , the line in the sand is clear			2
on one side is traditional espionage , a practice governed by hundreds of years of international norms that has recently spilled over from sea , air and land into cyberspace			0
it is a basic function of intelligence			0
on the other side , is corporate cybertheft , a new phenomenon in which the anonymity of cyberspace affords the thief an enormous advantage over the victim -- especially when the thief is a government and the victim is a business			0
quite simply , corporate cybertheft crosses the line because , in today 's ultra-competitive geopolitical landscape , it threatens the delicate balance of power between states			2
yes , states spy in cyberspace to protect themselves from threats			0
but the goal of corporate cybertheft is to fundamentally revise the balance of power -- and self - respecting nations simply ca n't tolerate such behavior			0
in unprecedented fashion , the faces of five officers from the previously disclosed @entity167 of the @entity48 now appear on a " wanted by the @entity6 " poster , a striking suggestion that perhaps prosecuting cybercrime should n't differ all that much from prosecuting other crimes			0
not too long ago , the overt portrayal of individuals otherwise known only by their virtual aliases would have been met by fierce opposition from those fearing diplomatic retribution			0
despite @entity33 's rhetoric and the summoning of the american ambassador to @entity33 @entity182 monday night , the @entity19 need not fear retribution			2
but now that we 've crossed the @entity186 with this indictment , it 's apparent that dealing with cybercrime is more than just a " name and shame " game			0
if , instead , the five @entity33 officers marched into @entity193 's headquarters , pulled out a gun and stole next year 's product development plans , nobody would debate whether or not they crossed the line			1
cyberspace does n't afford criminals any more latitude than the physical world , but it does increase the burden of proof on the accusing party -- so hopefully attorney general @entity30 did his homework			0
join us on @entity207 / @entity206 .			0

@entity209 says the recent *cyber-arrests* and @entity33 indictments signal a new era
*federal* law enforcement agencies and governments have *redefined* what crosses the line
