her mother 's hair was floating toward the drain			2
@entity196 went to get her father			0
@entity7 's recounting of how he found his wife is strikingly different from @entity196 's and will be something prosecutors focus on to show @entity7 's alleged lack of veracity			1
he told authorities his wife was draped over the side of the tub , head first , with her head in the water			0

the trial begins with jury selection on tuesday , and although prosecutors have laid their case out with numerous legal filings and a 2012 preliminary hearing , the defense has won many pretrial arguments keeping out statements and actions by @entity7 they feel are prejudicial and irrelevant			1

according to filed documents , not one conclusively states that @entity9 's manner of death was by homicide			0
forensic pathologists will only conclude to a degree of medical certainty that the manner of death is undetermined			0
now , it will be up to a @entity5 jury of @entity7 's peers to determine if his wife died at the hands of another -- specifically at the hands of her husband , who is now on trial for his life .			1
