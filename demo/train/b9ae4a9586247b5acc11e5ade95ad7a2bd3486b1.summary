-- with recriminations and accusations flying in the wake of riots that left 79 football fans dead in the northeastern city of @entity7 , the immediate future for @entity10 soccer looks particularly bleak			1
three days of mourning have begun for the victims of the violence that erupted after local team @entity14 had beaten @entity16 - based @entity15 3 - 1 on wednesday , but it will take far longer than that to understand how such a tragedy could have occurred			1
the domestic league was suspended indefinitely after the deaths just hours before prime minister @entity22 sacked the entire leadership of the @entity24 -- a move that is sure to warrant attention from @entity27			1
@entity30 's world 's governing body stipulates that governments should not tamper with a national soccer federation 's affairs , and an international ban for the @entity10 team could follow			1
deadly @entity10 riots go beyond football @entity27 president @entity38 has expressed his sympathy to the victims ' families and also asked for a detailed report on what happened			1
given the current confusion about exactly what did take place , he may be waiting a while			0
according to @entity15 board member , @entity48 , the security forces present in the stadium at @entity7 have a lot to answer for			1
" there were huge , even massive security breaches at the game -- the police showed total ignorance , " he told @entity0			1
" the fans moved like a tsunami , and quickly we were looking at a massacre			2
we believe that this is something that has been well organized			0
" i 'm sure there are some hidden hands behind this			0
but we ca n't really see or we can not really confirm who is behind all that			0
" in the wake of the tragedy , a number of @entity15 's players have said they are going to retire from the game , but @entity48 hopes they change their mind			2
anger flares in @entity10 after 79 die in soccer riot " ( the players ) are in a very bad shape in terms of morale			1
they 've seen people die in the dressing rooms , which normally does n't happen in the sports world			2
i think they have been under a lot of stress			0
" @entity15 has over 60 million fans and supporters			1
and i do n't think that the players will leave these fans because again the fans need them , and they need the fans			0
" blame has also been attached to the aging @entity7 stadium , which hosted the fateful game between two of @entity10 's biggest clubs			1
@entity100 , author of " when friday comes : football in the @entity110 , " a book about football and politics in the @entity105 , says many arenas in the country are not fit for the purpose			0
he told @entity0 : " i 've been to many football grounds across @entity10			2
we 're talking about stadiums built in the 1920s and 1930s , big crumbling concrete bowls that have few exits			0
" they are death traps , and this is something that has been waiting to happen			0
" there might be 70,000 allowed in a football stadium but 100,000 people come in , or 40,000 are supposed to be there and 70,000 people get in			2
" @entity126 : police stood idle in @entity10 football massacre there were flashpoints between fans when the teams played each other back in april , and @entity100 says it is inexplicable the authorities on hand at the stadium did not do more to protect fans			1
" at the moment everybody is wondering how and why the police allowed this to happen , " he added			0
" in any country in the world , if you have a rivalry between two football teams , and you do n't police it , there 's likely to be a high degree of violence and probably deaths involved			2
" in this case , for some reason , the police stood back and did n't police the match properly			0
" obviously the soccer ultras ( hardcore fans ) had a key role in the revolution , fighting the police and trying to bring down @entity158 ( former @entity10 leader ) -- many people are questioning if that is the real reason this was n't policed properly			1
" the league is a mess and i ca n't see it resuming anytime soon			0
