-- " the first thing he asked was ' are you the one who said that you are the best drummer in this country ? ' i laughed and told him , ' i never said so			0
' he asked me if i could play jazz and i said yes			0
he asked me if i could take solos and i said yes again			0
" that 's how @entity11 details his first ever encounter with @entity13 back in the mid- 1960s , a meeting that was destined to trigger an explosive sonic collaboration that a few years later gave birth to the blistering @entity18 sound -- arguably the most exciting period in the history of popular @entity22 music			1
this anecdote , and many more others , are featured in the newly released autobiography of @entity11 , the iconic @entity26 drummer who 's left an indelible stamp on the history of world music with his distinctive style and pioneering grooves			1
@entity32 has hailed @entity11 as the " greatest living drummer			2
" read this : the rise of @entity36 co-written with @entity37 , " @entity11 : an autobiography of the master drummer of @entity18 " follows @entity11 's life from his early days growing up in the heart of @entity40 , though his struggling first steps as a badly paid freelance musician , the meeting with @entity13 and the heights of their " @entity47 " band , to his departure from the group and his relocation to @entity51 in the mid 1980s			1
master drummer born in @entity40 in 1940 to a @entity26 father and a @entity57 mother , @entity11 was the oldest of six children			1
his first gig came in late 1950s when he started playing clefs in a highlife group called " @entity62 , " before taking over the band 's rhythm section			0
from then on , @entity11 went on to hone his self - taught drumming skills by dipping into different styles as a member of several other @entity40 bands -- including " @entity69 and the @entity70 , " " the @entity71 " and " the @entity72			2
" in 1964 , @entity11 met up with @entity13 and his career took a different , more exciting path			2
over the next 15 years , @entity11 would be the rhythmic engine for the @entity26 multi-instrumentalist and political rights activist , first for the highlife - jazz outfit " @entity79 " and then for the seminal " @entity81 " group			1
read this : @entity83 builds on his father 's legacy it was after the band returned from a 10 - month stay in the @entity89 in 1969 that @entity11 created the potent drumming concept of @entity18 , fusing the different beats and patterns he 'd heard while growing up with the new techniques he 'd mastered as a professional drummer -- everything from highlife and traditional @entity26 music to @entity99 jazz , funk and @entity101			1
" i was looking for something , " @entity11 says , from @entity51 , where he is currently based			1
" i wanted to be myself , " he adds			0
" i played like everybody already but there was no point in continuing doing that because i 'd be bored completely			0
" @entity11 , the only member of @entity13 's band allowed to compose his own parts , could famously drum in a different time signature with each of his four limbs			1
driven by his fluid and steady drumming , @entity47 70 went on to record a string of highly successful and politically charged albums , which turned @entity13 into a huge musical and countercultural icon in @entity26 and abroad			2
but it was onstage where the full force of @entity18 's intoxicating sound and the talents of @entity13 and @entity11 really shone through			1
" with me and @entity13 , it 's a question of telepathy , " @entity11 says of the musical closeness he enjoyed with " @entity47 70 's " firebrand leader			1
" that is why i was able to stick around this guy for 15 years -- you know , i never did that with anyone before ; the maximum time i stayed in a band was one year , " adds @entity11			1
" since i met him i knew that this guy had something , this is the type of challenge i needed ... i just believed that i am meeting a genius and it 's great to work with a genius			0
" life after @entity13 this deep appreciation of @entity13 's musical brilliance oozes through the pages of @entity11 's autobiography			1
but the narrative is also filled with wrangles over payments and recognition			0
in the end , @entity11 says it was not the ongoing pay disputes but the increasingly volatile situation around @entity13 's political activism that led to @entity11 leaving the group in 1978 -- events like the army attack on @entity13 's compound in 1977			1
" the only thing that happened was that it became a package of madness , " @entity11 says			0
" i stood it for a while too , i was inside it -- i had been arrested , i had to submit myself because he is like my brother			0
" read this : meet the @entity166 @entity11 's departure left a big void in the heart of the @entity18 sound			1
@entity13 , who replaced his polyrhythmic sideman with four drummers during live performances , once said that " there would be no afrobeat without @entity11			2
" the two remained friends until @entity13 's death in 1997			2
after leaving " @entity47 70 , " @entity11 went on to form his own bands in @entity26 before relocating to @entity51 in 1985			1
since then , he 's released several well - received albums			2
a musician committed to innovation , he 's joined forces with an eclectic roster of both @entity22 and international musicians over the years -- including @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
today , at the age of 73 , @entity11 still remains as active as ever			0
" i do n't see the end of exploring , " says @entity11 , who is currently working on a new album			0
it 's a sentiment echoed in his final remarks in the book			0
" i still challenge myself every time with my playing , " @entity11 writes			0
" i still want to play something impossible , something i never played before			0
