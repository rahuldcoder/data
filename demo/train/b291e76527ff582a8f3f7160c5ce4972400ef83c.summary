the @entity0 and @entity1 may be bombing a common enemy in @entity3 , one whom they both despise -- @entity6			1
recent media reports from the region claim @entity1 's military conducted air raids in eastern @entity3 , and on tuesday , a spokesman for the @entity12 said the reports might be true			1
" we have indications that they ( @entity1 ) have flown these missions in recent days , these airstrikes in eastern @entity3 , " rear admiral @entity14 told @entity16 's @entity15			1
no coordination , @entity0 says is @entity1 coordinating with the @entity0 - led coalition fighting the @entity23 extremists ? adamantly , no , came the answer from both sides			1
the @entity0 is not working with @entity1 's military , and it is not even directly communicating with it over operations in the country , @entity14 said			1
" we are not coordinating with nor are we deconflicting with @entity1 military , " he said			1
both sides are leaving it to @entity3 to manage their movements in @entity3 airspace and keep them both out of each other 's hair			0
speaking from @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity0 secretary of state @entity39 did n't confirm or deny @entity1 's military action , saying that 's up to the @entity3 or @entity1 government			1
but he did say that while the @entity0 is coordinating its military action with @entity3 authorities , " nothing has changed " as far as its lack of coordination with @entity1			1
" i think it 's self - evident that if @entity1 is taking ( action against @entity6 ) in some particular place , and it 's confined to taking on ( @entity6 ) and it has an impact , it 's going to be a net effect that is positive , " @entity39 said			1
" but it 's not something we 're coordinating			0
" @entity1 blames @entity0 for regional unrest a high - ranking @entity1 military official also vehemently rejected the notion that there may have been any coordinated bombing , and he attacked the @entity0 in his comments			1
" the @entity67 of @entity1 blames the @entity0 as the root cause of unrests and problems as well as the terrorist actions of @entity6 in @entity3 , " gen. @entity63 told the government - approved @entity64 , adding that @entity1 wants @entity0 influence to completely evaporate			1
in another @entity64 report , the head of @entity1 's @entity73 characterized the @entity0 as an enemy , not an ally			2
" today , the @entity0 are in a strategic dead - end and have experienced all possible options and strategies against the @entity81 , but could n't attain their desired goals , " maj. gen. @entity77 said			1
" the @entity0 capabilities can no more be expanded and their capacities for initiating a change have reached the level of saturation , meaning that the @entity0 is left with no more option but admitting the @entity67 of @entity1 's real power			2
" a common enemy yet @entity6 is one of few issues that @entity1 and the @entity0 agree on ; both countries want to quash the terror group that has been taking over large swaths of @entity3 and @entity96			1
but with no diplomatic relations with @entity1 and lingering concerns about its nuclear program , the @entity0 has had to walk a tightrope over @entity1 's involvement			2
this was reflected in comments that @entity0 president @entity104 made to @entity106 ' " @entity105			0
" " there is some deconflicting , in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around @entity115 ... we let them know , ' do n't mess with us			0
we 're not here to mess with you			0
' we 're focused on our common enemy , " @entity104 said			0
@entity1 defend @entity115 ? word of @entity1 participation in the fight against @entity6 is nothing new			2
a military official in @entity1 has said the world can thank his country that @entity6 has not been able to assault @entity115			2
" the ( @entity6 ) terrorists sought to surround @entity115 , but they failed in reaching their ominous goals thanks to @entity1 's supports , " @entity132			2
@entity133 is lieutenant commander of the @entity134 , an elite unit of @entity1 's @entity135			0
according to @entity64 , senior military officials in @entity115 said the @entity134 helped free the @entity3 town of @entity138 from @entity6 control			2
conflicting interests but the common interest is complicated by diverging interests			0
the @entity0 wants to put an end to all @entity23 extremism , and in the past , it has accused @entity145 of sponsoring terrorism			0
@entity1 itself is an @entity148 republic , governed by stringent @entity148 law			0
but the state religion is @entity151 , which @entity153 extremists , such as @entity6 , consider heresy			0
fear of religious tensions in neighboring @entity3 , there is a tense and at times violent schism between @entity151 and @entity23 factions , with the former dominating in government			0
@entity1 has close ties to the @entity151 faction			0
that has stirred fears in @entity166 that @entity1 's involvement could not only weaken @entity6 , but could also drive the wedge between @entity3 deeper			1
" we want nothing to be done that further inflames sectarian tensions in the country , " @entity14 said of @entity1 military actions			1
@entity1 is also a close ally of @entity96 dictator @entity176 , who is battling @entity6 as well			0
beating back @entity6 would take some pressure off of his troops			0
the @entity0 is calling for @entity176 's removal .			0

an @entity1 military leader says the @entity0 is at a " strategic dead - end "
