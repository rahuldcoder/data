@entity2 @entity1 officials pressured secretary of defense @entity4 to increase the pace of detainee transfers from the @entity9 prison in @entity10 , the outgoing secretary acknowledged to @entity3 's @entity12 in an interview friday			1
those comments come just one day after reports surfaced that a @entity10 detainee released as part of the deal that freed @entity9 pow sgt. @entity19 may have sought to return to militant activity			1
" not everyone at the @entity1 has agreed with me , " said @entity21 of his methodology for deciding on detainee releases			1
the outgoing secretary also said the @entity9 could find it necessary to send noncombat troops to the front lines in @entity30 to help @entity30 troops in their fight against @entity33			1
" we have to look at all the options , and i think it may require a forward deployment of some of our troops -- not doing the fighting , not doing the combat work that we did at one time for six years in @entity30 and we did for many , many years in @entity42 , but to help airstrike precision ( locate targets ) , " he told @entity12			1
" i would say , though , we 're not there yet			0
whether we get there or not , i do n't know , " @entity21 added , reiterating his position on the issue			1
in november , @entity21 acknowledged the possibility of ground forces in @entity30 but said these would not be combat troops			1
that same month , the chairman of the @entity55 , gen. @entity56 , told a congressional committee that he would not rule out asking the president to send @entity9 ground troops into @entity30			1
throughout the hearing , @entity56 and @entity21 described a mission in @entity30 and @entity62 that will likely be long and fraught with setbacks			1
disagreements between @entity21 and officials in the president 's inner circle have been widely reported during his short tenure as secretary of defense			1
but in his interview with @entity3 , @entity21 spoke with uncharacteristic candor about friction related to the prisoner release			1
" we 've had a lot of conversations , " @entity21 said			1
" with the @entity1 ? " @entity12 pushed back			1
" yes , " said @entity21			2
" but @entity21 also said he is n't fazed by the pressure on the issue of detainee transfers			2
" because i have the responsibility and i play my own game here , " he emphasized			0
" and that is because , by law , i am the one official in government charged with certification of release of detainees			2
i take that responsibility very seriously			0
" debate about detainee transfers was rekindled thursday when news emerged that one of the five former prisoners freed to @entity98 in exchange for @entity19 's release by the @entity101 may have attempted to rejoin the fight by making contact with suspected @entity101 associates in @entity42			1
@entity105 swapped for @entity19 suspected of militant activities the administration insists that the released detainees are being monitored , and officials remain confident the potential risks are mitigated by the measures they have in place			1
in his interview with @entity3 , @entity21 echoed that view , and said he has no regrets about making the deal			2
" absolutely it was the right decision , " he said			0
" it was the right decision ... because we do n't leave our troops behind			2
" " it was a prisoner of war exchange and i 'm absolutely as committed to that decision today as when the decision was made			2
" it was the right decision			0
" and when the @entity1 ramped up pressure , @entity21 said he knew how to take the heat			1
said @entity21 : " if you 're not prepared to deal with pressure , every day , in the job you 're in , coming from a lot of different directions , then you should n't be in the job			2
it 's just part of the process , part of any job i think			0
" who were the detainees swapped for @entity19 ? @entity21 's candor as he prepares to leave the @entity143 was evident on other issues as well			1
he was blunt in addressing the budget cuts the military has grappled with in recent years as the wars in @entity30 and @entity42 draw to a close			2
" i am concerned about the future of our force , the quality of that force , " said @entity21 , adding that he hears frequently from soldiers who worry they wo n't have the same career prospects in the military they 'd have in the private sector			2
about half of those soldiers say they plan to leave the military as a result , he added			0
" i do n't think @entity2 understands the depth of that issue because that 's a difficult quantifiable issue , " @entity21 said			2
" it 's not a budget line			0
" the secretary also addressed the ongoing fight against @entity33 in @entity62 and @entity30 , where the @entity9 is leading an international coalition to take on the terror group			1
@entity33 poses a threat to @entity9 interests , @entity21 said , but the problem can not be solved using military power alone			1
" big societal problems -- historic injustices , conflicts -- do n't get solved militarily , " said @entity21			0
" there is a military component to it , of course			0
but it 's going to require -- always does and always will -- political settlements			0
" and that military component comes with risks , @entity21 acknowledged , even when the @entity9 does n't commit ground combat troops			1
" any time you introduce @entity9 military power anywhere in the region ... there 's always risk , " he said			0
" there 's risk to our people in @entity30 , to our people in @entity42 , to our people who are conducting strikes in @entity62			0
" it 's a risk the secretary understands well , having been a soldier during the @entity205			0
" i think it has helped me a tremendous way to connect with second - and third - level issues of the men and women and their families who make the sacrifices , " @entity21 said of his experience in the military			0
" i think i understand it			0
" " it does n't mean i 'm any better , " he added			0
" it does n't mean i 'm any smarter			0
but i think i understand it maybe in ways that i might not otherwise unless i had served			0
" from soldier to secretary of defense -- it 's a transition even @entity21 could not have imagined for himself during his time in uniform			0
" had i been told 48 years ago when i joined the @entity228 i would end up being secretary of defense , " he said , " i just would have laughed			0

@entity9 eventually may find it necessary to deploy noncombat troops to @entity30 front lines , @entity21 says
@entity21 says " not everyone at the @entity1 " has agreed with him on how to release detainees
but @entity21 still backed the @entity1 on the decision to swap a @entity241 prisoner for sgt. @entity19
