-- newly uncovered documents from a confidante of @entity3 are making headlines about the former first lady			2
but they also reveal new details about legacy moments in her husband 's presidency that were frustrating and distracting to the @entity12			1
it seemed as if @entity14 had too many choices in his first chance to name a @entity18 justice and not enough for his second			1
the deliberations went down to the wire , and when @entity23 's name came up each time , he was not the person the president , in his heart , preferred			1
" at this point @entity28 [ @entity14 ] also said he did not want to name @entity23 , " wrote @entity27 in may 1994 just two days before he was ultimately selected			1
" did n't want to give a big deal to @entity31			2
" that 's where @entity23 , then 55 , was serving			1
apparently naming someone from that reliably liberal state would not pay political dividends			0
@entity37 was a close family friend who took copious notes of conversations she had with both @entity41 throughout most of their @entity12 years that ended in 2001			2
notes from that conversation with @entity14 are part of papers @entity37 , then a @entity48 professor , left the school after her death in 2000			1
@entity0 has uncovered one inside look at how @entity23 was ultimately chosen , and it mirrors the tricky , often delicate game of politics nearly every @entity12 must navigate			1
@entity37 's three - page memo affirms much of what a variety of sources have told @entity0 about the @entity23 selection process			1
but she adds a fresh layer of detail on the last - minute maneuvering to get @entity14 to decide			1
back to ' 93 it all began a year earlier soon after @entity14 took office in 1993			1
justice @entity66 was retiring and the president had his first chance to create a legacy with a high - profile pick			0
sources said @entity14 had lots of ideas of who should sit on the high court -- too many , in the eyes of many @entity12 staffers			1
names included @entity80 gov. @entity79 , senate majority leader @entity81 , and education secretary @entity82			0
interior secretary @entity84 's name was quietly leaked , but @entity86 @entity85 made clear he would face a rocky confirmation			2
in her words : @entity3 then and now @entity14 even briefly considered naming his wife to the court -- which he labeled an intriguing , " sexy " idea -- but was quickly talked out of it , according to former top @entity12 aide @entity95 , in his memoir			1
" we do n't need another gang - that - could n't - shoot - straight story , " reluctantly concluded the president , according to @entity95			2
more traditional choices were then considered -- federal appeals court judges			0
among them was @entity23 , then chief judge on the @entity105 - based @entity104			1
he was asked to come to the @entity12 and interview personally with @entity14			1
but there was one problem			0
he had days earlier suffered a serious accident on his bicycle , and sources said he left his hospital bed to come to @entity112			0
the interview " went badly , " @entity113 , @entity0 's senior legal analyst , wrote in " @entity114 , " his book on the @entity18			2
" normally a friendly , almost garrulous man , @entity23 was short of breath and still in pain , " wrote @entity113			1
" afterwards , @entity14 told his staff @entity23 seemed ' heartless '			1
... i do n't see enough humanity			2
i want a judge with soul			0
" still , government sources say @entity23 was on the verge of being selected until he tapped @entity126			1
she served on the @entity128 , where her colleagues at one time included @entity131 and @entity132			0
both would precede her on the high court			0
despite her clear liberal record on the bench , the nominee was well received and received near unanimous @entity86 approval			0
it also helped boost the morale of a @entity12 struggling in its first year from a series of political setbacks			0
@entity14 knew he had a winner in the second woman to sit on the high court , introducing her by saying she had a " big heart			2
" friend 's papers giver insight into rise of the @entity41 the 1994 pick fast forward one year			0
justice @entity152 announced his retirement april 6 , presenting another chance for @entity14 to burnish his legacy			1
the five - week selection process was again unwieldy , as the @entity37 memo shows			0
her notes from that may 11 conversation with @entity14 show it was ostensibly about the " @entity18 appointment , " but other topics kept cropping up			1
@entity14 was worried about the midterm congressional elections , even his own political future ( " @entity28 not sure he can get reelected " )			2
yet , it was clear @entity14 was torn between his personal and political sides -- focusing on one man -- judge @entity170 , a fellow @entity171 on the 8th @entity128			2
the two were not close but @entity170 had a national reputation , with some later calling him one the greatest judges never to have sat on the @entity18			0
but there were three problems , among them his divorce years earlier			0
@entity37 's memo notes county divorce records point to some " messy allegations " that might complicate @entity170 's chances			2
" this thing is so sick , according the @entity28 [ @entity14 ] , in a way he wants to stand up to it , but [ the issue ] will come out and will be part of the pattern of sleaze , " she writes			2
there were also concerns of perceived nepotism , which fellow @entity37 tried to downplay to the president			0
" @entity28 is furious about what has been done to @entity171 , how they 've taken all the joy and happiness out of @entity28 's victory , turned the state into the killing field -- this would restore their pride and happiness , " she paraphrases him saying			0
but the biggest lingering concern was @entity170 's health			0
he had been diagnosed years previously with low - grade @entity208 's lymphoma , and the cancer had produced tumors , spreading through his body			0
although @entity170 was able to function " more or less normally , " wrote @entity113 , a doctor told @entity14 on may 13 that there was no way he could say " that @entity170 's disease ' would not interfere ' with his duties as a @entity18 justice			1
" @entity3 's big concern @entity37 's memo says this was " @entity222 [ @entity3 's ] greatest concern , makes it seem he 's [ @entity14 ] is not taking this , his greatest legacy , seriously , if [ he puts in ] someone who may die in 5 years of less time			1
" @entity170 stayed active on the bench until his 2004 death			0
but @entity170 , in @entity37 's mind , was clearly the best choice and she strongly urged @entity14 to " go ahead and appoint @entity234 , because that 's what he really wanted to do			1
" the president was not even remotely close to a decision , and he urged @entity37 to speak with his wife after their conversation			0
the first lady was " wild " about the issue of @entity170 's health			0
@entity37 paraphrases her close friend saying , " @entity28 would n't even think about naming someone from @entity247 or @entity248 if they had possible cancer threat -- so why do it just because he knows the guy , " writes @entity37			0
" if @entity222 carried the day , and sounds as if she is , it will be @entity84			0
she 's not wild about him			0
wishes there were a 3rd choice			0
which in itself is very , very sad and strange , " according to @entity37 's notes			2
after hearing @entity170 's medical prognosis from the doctor , @entity14 later that day made up his mind			1
the final decision was sudden , and @entity14 wanted it public immediately , before his pick could get down to @entity112			1
so @entity23 was n't even present when the announcement was made			1
the whole selection process lacked the excitement and momentum of the one a year earlier but both of @entity14 's high court choices have turned out to be great successes			1
@entity126 and @entity23 have carved a consistent left - leaning record , and are well - liked and respected by their colleagues			2
@entity0 's @entity278 and @entity279 contributed to this report			0

notes taken by @entity14 confidante reveal new details about @entity23 's selection to bench
deliberations went down to the wire each time and @entity23 was n't the one @entity14 really wanted
when he was selected , @entity14 wanted it announced quickly ; @entity23 was n't even present
