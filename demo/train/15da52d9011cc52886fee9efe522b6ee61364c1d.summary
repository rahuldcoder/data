-- as i type this week 's column , i look out of my office window and stare at a depressing sight			1
a heavy blanket of smog and dust hangs over the sky			0
buildings nearby are barely visible			0
i checked the website of the @entity12			0
it rated @entity15 's air quality for the day as " slightly polluted "			1
on @entity19 , however , the @entity18 @entity17 's @entity16 , an air - quality monitoring app , rated the air pollution level as " hazardous			1
" what gives ? i visited the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) to find out			0
" we 've been using equipment imported from the @entity18 to monitor air quality ever since we set up in 1987 , " vice director @entity24 tells me			1
" we use the same techniques as the @entity18 system			2
" but there is one difference : the @entity33 monitoring stations measure particulates 10 micrometers or smaller , a standard known as @entity36			1
@entity37 , which reports the reading of an air monitory device installed on the roof of the @entity18 embassy building , uses the @entity36 , which measures tiny airborne particulates that cause smog and are deemed more harmful			1
it ranks air quality from 1 ( cleanest ) to 500 ( dirtiest )			1
" it measures the very fine particulates which are health concerns , things less than 2.5 micrometers , " @entity18 ambassador @entity45 tells @entity0 's @entity46			1
" acceptable range in the @entity18 is 35			2
here we are near 400 , more than 10 times the acceptable level			0
" that was a few days earlier , when @entity46 interviewed the @entity18 envoy			2
thursday 's reading on @entity37 : 321			0
i have lived in @entity15 for nearly 40 years and have seen the air 's quality go from bad to worse			1
i never imagined it to be this bad			0
experts blame the thick haze on rapid urbanization and industrialization			0
" what come with them are cars , industries and pollution sources from all kinds of directions , " says @entity64 , @entity33 director of @entity65 , a @entity66 - based international organization			1
@entity15 , for instance , burned some 27 million tons of coal in 2010 , according to state - run media			1
despite efforts to limit the number cars with an auto - plate lottery , it 's estimated that @entity15 now has over 5 million cars , up from about 3.5 million in 2008			1
pollution is more acute because of the sheer size of the city 's population ( 17 million ) and the rapid speed of its economic growth , experts say			0
some say the costs are mounting			0
" they are paying a price first of all individually by premature deaths , " says @entity91 , executive director of the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , who is in @entity15 to launch the agency 's " green economy " report			2
" @entity33 as a society also pays a heavy price in terms of healthcare and lost productivity			2
" the picture is not all dark			0
@entity33 acknowledges the problems and has pledged to solve them			2
" if you look at @entity33 's five - year plan ( for 2011 - 2015 ) , there are green - development plans that set high ambitions in energy efficiency , renewable energy as well as pollution reductions and control , " notes @entity64			1
@entity92 's @entity115 compliments @entity33 as the world 's biggest investor in renewable energy for spending $ 49 billion last year			1
on the grassroots level , rumblings of a green movement are starting to be heard			0
@entity121 ( environmental protection ) is now a catch - phrase among residents and local journalists			1
public complaints over @entity15 's worsening air quality are common			1
in recent days , some @entity33 microbloggers posted pictures of the national @entity131 stadium , also known as the " @entity132 " , taken on blue - sky days during the @entity134 , juxtaposed with pictures of the stadium covered with smog			2
in response , the @entity22 has opened its facilities to the public once a week			2
" we receive scores of residents and local journalists , " @entity24 says as she shows me inside a hall equipped with computers and a huge tv screen			0
" we show them how we do our monitoring , show how equipments work , and explain our standards and systems			0
it 's good that people are now interested in what we do			0
" @entity24 says @entity33 may adopt more stringent pm2.5 standards , but gradually			2
" it takes time to improve the standards we are using and to gradually adopt international standards , " she says			0
" we 'll gradually raise our standards and it is possible that we 'll adopt higher standards as the air quality in @entity33 gets better			1
" a number of @entity33 netizens are pushing @entity15 to change standards immediately			1
@entity166 , a @entity33 real estate tycoon , recently asked his 7.5 million fans on @entity168 , a microblogging social network similar to @entity19 , to vote on whether @entity15 should adopt more stringent standards			1
of the 40,000 who voted , 92 % agreed that " the authorities adopt @entity36 this year			0
" " i think that 's definitely the direction to go , " says @entity172			0
" @entity33 so far has been monitoring @entity36 and from the epidemiological perspective , we all know when the particles are bigger they do n't go too deep into your lungs and respiratory system			2
but actually , the more hazardous polluter will be @entity36			0
" @entity64 hopes the @entity33 government will soon adopt the higher standards , although she is not sure how quickly it can be done			1
" it 's being debated at this moment , " she says there are encouraging signals this week			2
@entity33 media reports say that at least two cities in south @entity33 have decided to adopt @entity36 on trial basis			0
will @entity15 follow suit ? @entity64 hopes for quicker actions			0
" i have an 11 - year - old child , " she says			1
" i really wish for better air quality , for the nation 's authorities to do something not just for us but for future generations			1
that remains a concern for parents like me and many others			0
