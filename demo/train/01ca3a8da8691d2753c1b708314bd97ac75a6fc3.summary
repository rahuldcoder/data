-- last year @entity1 sold out two consecutive nights at @entity4 's famed @entity3 , a venue that most standup comedians aspire to at some point in their career			1
for @entity1 , who took the arena 's stage as part of his global @entity13 , which also filled @entity16 ' @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17 , the occasion was so momentous that it deserved its own film			1
the comedian , along with directors @entity20 and @entity22 , used the performance as the centerpiece of his new movie , " @entity1 : let me explain , " which opens in theaters wednesday			1
although largely a standup movie , " @entity13 " is framed with a fictional intro where @entity1 is inundated with a barrage of questions about his life and career -- all of which he determines to answer onstage at @entity3			1
this opening offers the comedian an opportunity to showcase the worldwide aspect of the @entity39 before eventually revealing his entire standup set			1
the comedian , who has numerous feature films in the works and recently made a brief appearance in the apocalyptic comedy " @entity52 , " spoke with @entity0 in a suite at the @entity49 @entity48 the day of the movie 's premiere			1
@entity1 , clad in sunglasses to veil his exhaustion , recounted the process of creating " @entity13 , " why he got so emotional onstage at @entity3 and how he might be the busiest person alive			1
@entity0 : when you were filming your let me explain comedy tour last year , was the intention always to make it into a feature film ? @entity1 : yes			1
i was n't sure of the direction i wanted to take the movie in , but i just knew i wanted to document everything i was doing that year because it was so much , especially the world tour aspect of it			1
it was just putting camera crews in place to capture absolutely everything that we did and at the end of it just put the pieces of the puzzle i had in my head together			2
it all came together well			2
but as we were going along i tracked it and i knew the pieces i had , and it was just tying them together			2
@entity0 : how did you come up with the idea for how the movie is framed ? @entity1 : i need a segue into the documentary aspect of [ the movie ] and the best way to do that , i felt , was to jokingly address what 's been happening to me for the past two years			1
everybody coming up to me asking questions , and when i go to answer it they tell me what their answer is			2
you do n't allow me to tell them what 's going on -- you tell me what you think you know because you 've heard things about me			2
it was a different way to open a standup film and i 'm all about being different and trying to break ground with original ideas			1
@entity0 : do you legitimately feel like you have to explain yourself ? @entity1 : yes and no. at the end of the day your fans are the people who support you in and out			1
as a celebrity you can try to say you do n't care and say , " this is my life , i do n't live for other people " all you want			2
we have no obligation to do things for our fans , but my feeling is that we do n't get to where we are or get what we get without the support of our fans			2
so if there 's questions going around that your fans have because of things that they 've heard , i think you do owe it to them to address it			2
@entity0 : at the end of the movie you get really emotional about being in @entity3			1
what does it mean to you to perform in a venue like that ? @entity1 : you 're looking at me achieving a goal that i did n't think was achievable			1
i 'm sure everyone knows now that only a few have performed in @entity3			1
that list is so small			2
now i 'm on that list			2
i 'm a part of a very small group , which is unbelievable			2
you relish in that moment for a second			2
when i did that onstage it choked me up because i genuinely thought about what i 've accomplished and where i was and what i did to get here			2
and now that i 'm here , the sky 's the limit			0
i 'm in love with this , with making people laugh			0
and the fact that i had this venue to do it in was crazy			0
@entity0 : now that you 've conquered @entity3 , do you have a new goal you 're aiming to achieve ? is there even a bigger venue you could play ? @entity1 : i have no idea where you go next			1
no idea ! i 'm scared			0
@entity0 : do you approach standup in the same way you would approach a movie or tv role ? @entity1 : i do n't approach it like it 's a movie role			1
i genuinely love doing standup and i 'm a comedian first , so for me what makes my standup special is the fact that i do n't have to adapt or adjust			0
i am who i am			0
i appeal to everyone , hence in the movie doing a world tour			1
i 'm not changing , i 'm not adjusting my voice , i 'm not changing my speed and the way that i talk			0
so i think the prep for that is me just enjoying what i do			0
@entity0 : when you talk about your family and your kids in your standup , is that coming from a personal place ? @entity1 : personal place			1
the motivation is wanting to put myself out there so people can see that i 'm genuine and i 'm real			0
what you see is what you get			0
i 'm not trying to be someone else			0
@entity0 : what else do you have coming up beyond " @entity13 ? " @entity1 : i have like five movies coming out			1
everything will be out in 2014 and 2015			0
i think i 'm getting the opportunity to play the kind of character i 'm interested in now			0
the movie " @entity207 , " starring @entity206 and myself , is an action comedy and i 'm doing everything i ever wanted to do in the film			1
[ i also have ] " @entity211 , " which is a remake of the original , starring @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 and myself , and " @entity216 , " which stars @entity218 and @entity219			1
i 'm about to do one with @entity220 [ and ] i 'm about to do one with @entity221			0
i 'm sure i 'm forgetting one			0
@entity0 : and you were just cast in the new @entity225 movie as well , right ? @entity1 : yeah ! my part , from what i understand , is i 'm playing an assistant			1
i have n't read the newest draft that came in			0
but it 's a funny reveal cameo he asked me to do			0
@entity0 : what 's the status of the second season of your tv show " @entity237 ? " @entity1 : that will be in its third season			1
the second season starts premiering , i think , in september or october , and that 's probably when we 'll start shooting [ the third season ]			0
@entity0 : what does your average day look like ? @entity1 : no sleep ! right now i 'm probably going on 27 hours awake			1
so my days are hectic			0
once i 'm done with this today i go to @entity248			0
after that i go to the premiere			0
i got to introduce the premiere			0
then i get on a plane and i fly to @entity252			0
i land and i go straight to the set and i 'm shooting until 4 a.m. it 's ridiculously crazy			1
at some point i 'm just going to shut down			0
i do n't know when it 's going to happen today , but someone 's going to stop talking to me and i 'm going to be asleep			0
once i stop talking it 's all over .			0
