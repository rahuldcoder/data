@entity9 visits with her grandfather , dr. @entity10 , during his trip to @entity12 last year			2
the only light was from a television tuned to the latest news from @entity16 , and her laptop displaying her @entity19 page in hope of any updates on what was happening halfway around the world			1
" i kind of felt i was more there when i could n't see the rest of the room , just the tv and the @entity19 , " the 28 - year - old @entity16 - @entity12 told @entity0 by telephone from her home in @entity26 , @entity27			1
repeated calls to relatives in @entity33 only got the " annoying " @entity35 error message			2
she recounted the thoughts running through her brain all night : " are they going to really shoot people ? what 's going to happen ? is this going to turn into massive killing and violence ? " in @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity45 said the anxiety of waiting and wondering was like endless pacing at a hospital during a loved one 's operation			1
" it feels like the operation started last week and it has n't ended , " @entity45 , 28 , told @entity0 by telephone			1
i 'm hoping it will be good but i 'm worried it will get very ugly			2
" the jumble of emotions -- fear , hope , anxiety , frustration -- were reality for millions of @entity16 - @entity12 trying to find out if @entity16 authorities would crush protests over last week 's election			1
president @entity68 was declared the overwhelming victor in voting that opposition groups called rigged			2

the uncertainty and unrest strikes close to home for @entity10 , whose grandfather -- a longtime politician in @entity16 -- was arrested from his hospital bed this week			1
he 's been returned to the hospital , she said , but she does n't know if he 'll be arrested again or what will happen to other relatives			2
" it 's very exhausting , " @entity10 said			2
" i have this feeling i want to be there			0
i want to book the next flight			0
i want to be with the people			0
i do n't care about the risks involved			0
" her parents , who left @entity16 in the 1970s before the @entity105 , say such talk is foolish , she said			1
they are as worried as she is , but fear returning now would bring too much risk			2
" there 's a generation gap , a culture gap , " she explained			1
it runs deep , defining her life as an @entity12 - born citizen of both @entity16 and the @entity12 , who refers to @entity16 as " my people			1
" " being born and raised in @entity12 , where i was able to voice my opinion , do what i want , say what i wanted , i 'm culturally confused , " @entity10 said			0
" i 'm not completely @entity12 the right way , and i 'm not completely @entity16 the right way			1
" @entity45 also mentioned the generation gap among @entity16 - @entity12 , but he described it as more political			1
his parents ' generation lost everything in the revolution , and will only consider returning when the revolutionary regime has been toppled , he said			0
older @entity16 - @entity12 in the @entity12 " actually boycotted the election , saying if you vote you 're just legitimizing the government , " @entity45 said			1
" we sacrificed everything for you guys , and now you 're going to the other team , " is how @entity45 characterized their attitude			0
" they think the system needs to go completely , " he said			0
" all they care is for the system to collapse			0
they think if the system collapses , they 're going to be able to go back			0
" no matter what happens , @entity45 and @entity10 said , @entity16 is changed forever by this week 's events			1
" i believe that anything that comes out of it will be positive , " @entity45 said			0
