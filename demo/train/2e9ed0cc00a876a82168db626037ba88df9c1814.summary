-- the relationship between sporting greats and great venues and events is often complicated			1
@entity5 thrives at the @entity6			2
but @entity7 never scored a century at the home of cricket @entity10 while the clay courts at the @entity12 blunted the talent of tennis legend @entity14			1
in downhill skiing , though , the man widely considered the best ever had few relationship issues with the mountain all in his sport want to conquer			1
@entity20 won five overall downhill @entity22 titles			1
at one stage he was so dominant he won 11 races in a row			1
and at downhill 's most famous and feared slope , the @entity29 , on the @entity27 mountain in @entity28 , he came down the quickest four times			1
the @entity33 means strip or stripe			2
its combination of blind turns and varying gradients make it the hardest and scariest out there			2
" the first time when i came here and i saw the downhill i said : ' i 'm not doing this , these guys are crazy , they are just nuts ' , " @entity20 told @entity0 's @entity40			1
' it is the most difficult and daring downhill on the whole circuit			1
that 's why its such a good race			2
if you are a good downhiller you 've got to win @entity28			2
" by the sound of it , @entity54 ace @entity20 knows every nook and cranny of the course so well it is as if he could ski the course blind			1
" you have no time to get into the race			2
" if you compare it to @entity65 , there you start with a few gentle turns			2
" on the @entity67 you accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers an hour in just three seconds			2
" and just five seconds after the start you hit the " mousetrap " , a blind jump where the racers pick their line from trees on the other side of the valley			2
" the first time i did it i thought i could n't make it			0
i tried it and i was going very awkwardly and i did it and i thought wow ! and then it became my favorite part of the course , " recalls @entity20			1
" then you have the @entity85 -- which translates as steep rock slope -- it 's the most difficult turn			0
it 's a left hanging turn which traverses a hill leaning the other way and you have to carry all your speed through it to the flat bit next			0
" if you have no speed there you 're done			0
you can drink your beer half way down , " adds @entity20 with a chuckle			1
and well might he laugh			0
he did win here four times , a record only broken last year by @entity104 's @entity103			0
" the first was very special because i had won all my races up to @entity28			1
it would be my fifth victory , which would tie the record for wins in one season			1
" i had a crash in the training run , so was a little injured			0
everything went wrong , but still i won the race , and went on to win the next and set a new record			1
" for his first victory in 1975 he was the hot favorite			1
" i did n't win @entity28 for seven years			0
i could n't believe it , this is my downhill and i could n't win it any more			1
what 's happened ? " and then i was in the starting gate in 1984 and i knew i was going to win this race			0
i was going for it			0
" @entity126 is back in @entity28 where this weekend the latest generation tackle the slope which has staged races since 1931			0
in a sport where the talk now is all of preparation , his advice is a little surprising			0
" i know exactly where i want to ski but usually i am not where i want to ski ! " the big thing you have to be able to do is improvise , not stick to your line			0
if you stick to your line , most likely you are going to be very slow			0
you just let it go			0
and then sometime you are 10 meters off your line and you just have to go on from there			0
" it was this ability to think on his skis that secured his most famous @entity143 victory at the @entity6 in 1976 in front of a ecstatic home crowd in @entity146			1
he was the last man to go in the final and the hopes of a nation rested on his shoulders			0
" halfway down i looked at the crowd and they were cheering but not that enthusiastically , and i thought i better do something , better change something , otherwise i will not win the race			0
" so i changed totally the line , and went all the way up to a fence on a big right hander			0
i had n't even inspected up there			0
i was skiing right on the edge			1
" it seems the most famous races of them all really are won not beforehand , but in the 100 - odd seconds it takes to get to the bottom .			1
