-- @entity1 can do the most ordinary or the most sinister of things , and still come across as cute			0
so you can just imagine the mushy effect on your insides upon seeing this little group of @entity9 penguins ( also called jackass penguins , no joke ) waddling around dressed in tiny penguin - sized @entity13 outfits at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17			1
some dressed like @entity19 , some like @entity13 trees , they walked , marched and melted the hearts of every squealing , @entity18 - toting onlooker twice a day since the beginning of december			1
zookeepers lead them around the zoo , also dressed for the occasion			0
while their march was slated to go on twice a day every day until @entity13 , the schedule has been unexpectedly cut short due to the drops in temperature in @entity17			2
" today was the last day , " said @entity15 's media spokesperson @entity35			0
" as they are @entity9 penguins they are not used to the cold weather so we wanted to make sure they did n't fall ill. " and what 's the park 's response to the @entity45 's headline wondering if the march was " cute or cruel ? " " it 's exercise for the penguins and they are in a very safe environment with keepers they trust , so we do n't believe it should be considered cruel in any way , " said @entity35 .			2
