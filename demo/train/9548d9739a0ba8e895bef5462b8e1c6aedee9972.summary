-- advancements in @entity3 missile capabilities are driving @entity6 @entity5 countries to cooperate on a theater - wide missile defense system			1
the fear is that @entity3 could launch missiles at refineries , population centers , oil tankers and naval forces if conflict erupted			2
to deter and , if necessary , destroy @entity3 missiles , the @entity15 is championing a defense shield across the @entity18 , covering @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23			1
but pronouncements are easier to make than to realize in practice			0
can these @entity6 nations overcome their differences for their mutual protection ? is @entity15 diplomacy sufficient to forge such collaboration ? the proposal occurs amid escalating tensions with @entity3			1
last year the @entity33 raised new concerns about @entity3 's secretive nuclear programs			2
diplomacy failed to address these issues , prompting the @entity15 and @entity38 to tighten sanctions against @entity3 's oil economy			1
while the @entity43 regime ratchets up its rhetoric , senior @entity15 officials are trying to forestall an @entity46 pre-emptive attack on @entity3 's nuclear sites and to reassure @entity6 leaders that a @entity15 - led defensive umbrella would mitigate the effects of any conflict			1
the @entity15 has potent , seaborne @entity53 anti-missile defenses to offer , and @entity46 and @entity20 have previously invested in missile defense systems			1
indeed , @entity20 recently announced a major modernization of its @entity57 , or @entity57 , missile systems			2
but the latest scheme is a plan to build a regional network linking @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 into a wider intelligence and early - warning network , offering them defensive systems that can operate with @entity65			1
opinion : @entity67 on @entity3 is just like @entity68 recent multibillion - dollar deals include @entity19 's purchase of 60 new @entity57 missiles and a variety of radars , control stations and launching stations ; and the @entity23 ' deployment of both @entity57 short - range interceptors and @entity78 , or @entity78 , medium - range interceptors			1
meanwhile , the @entity15 has been beefing up defenses at its bases in @entity20 and @entity21 ( headquarters of the @entity84 's @entity83 ) as well as erecting an early - warning radar system in @entity22			1
the chaos in @entity87 adds urgency to these efforts			0
president @entity90 has threatened to fire missiles and chemical weapons against states that intervene in @entity87 's civil war , presumably including countries supporting future @entity15 military activities			2
but while @entity87 may pose a threat to some in the region , theater missile defenses are primarily aimed at @entity3 's mounting military arsenal			2
those growing capabilities include short - range missiles designed to hit sea - based targets as well as medium - range shahab and @entity107 missiles			0
@entity3 's missiles are mostly mobile and thus difficult to strike pre-emptively			0
the @entity109 estimates that @entity3 could test - flight an intercontinental missile , capable of carrying a nuclear warhead , as early as 2015			1
in the midst of these tensions , few would be shocked by a war with @entity3			0
indeed , many already see a low - level " shadow war " under way , with assassinations , terrorism , offensive cyberwarfare ( including the use of the @entity127 computer worm that infected @entity3 's nuclear enrichment facilities at @entity129 ) , unmanned aerial vehicles and the use of special operations forces widely reported			2
the @entity3 have threatened to close the @entity131 oil route , a move that could be accomplished by laying mines and targeting the narrow shipping chokepoint , or using swarm boat tactics to attack combat ships and tankers , or blowing up critical energy infrastructure that would be costly and difficult to replace			0
in other words , any missile defenses would be part of a larger war , making it difficult to predict the various scenarios that might unfold in a prolonged , wider war with @entity3			2
opinion : a lull in the drift toward war with @entity3 ? all these military measures would have to be tied to political goals			0
yet an escalating conflict could easily lead to shifting war aims and mission creep			0
for example , the @entity15 and its allies might seek regime change rather than just the eradication of @entity3 's nuclear program			1
likewise , for the @entity3 regime , objectives could encompass not just survival and sanction - busting but also a desire to inflict economic harm on the @entity15 and threaten the viability of @entity46			1
@entity46 , with its @entity167 and @entity168 anti-ballistic missile defense systems , has the world 's most robust national missile defenses in the world			0
yet if @entity43 acquires nuclear weapons , many @entity46 believe the @entity3 would use them as an offensive weapon and not just to achieve deterrence			0
@entity46 's @entity167 can protect against short - range missiles , and recently upgraded @entity168 systems are designed to thwart advanced medium - range missiles			0
but reports are rampant that @entity46 prime minister @entity179 might pre-emptively strike @entity3 's nuclear facilities before the @entity15 november elections			1
no doubt such reports are only further encouraging the @entity68 administration 's intensive efforts to strengthen deterrence and reassure regional partners			0
opinion : what if @entity46 bombs @entity3 ? but it is unlikely that @entity46 and the @entity191 can forge a seamless missile shield across a vast region			1
indeed , there are serious questions about how well @entity191 can share information and act in concert			2
what 's new this past year is that five of the six - member states that make up the @entity201 ( @entity202 being the outlier ) are attempting @entity205 - like security cooperation despite their different agendas and historical antipathies			0
longstanding differences are unlikely to be bridged in a matter of months -- unless something forces them together			0
no country is eager to blunder into war with @entity3			0
at the same time , should conflict escalate , @entity3 's actions may drive disparate actors , even @entity191 and @entity46 , to unprecedented collaboration for their mutual defense			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity220 : @entity6 @entity5 countries are cooperating on a missile shield against @entity3
@entity225 : @entity15 is hoping to cover @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23
@entity225 : @entity109 says @entity3 could test - flight an intercontinental missile as early as 2015
there are serious questions about how well @entity191 can collaborate , @entity225 says
