@entity0 , @entity1 -- they search the ocean depths hunting for evidence left by predators deadlier than great white sharks			2
they are members of the @entity10 's @entity9 , an elite group of special agents tracking terrorism underwater			1
starting next year , this 10 - member team could be called on to search for evidence left behind by international terrorists in water contaminated by chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear waste			1
" there have been enough scenarios recently , " says team member supervisory special agent @entity20 , citing the 2008 attacks in @entity22 , @entity23 , which began when terrorists entered the port city by boat			2
" if you look at @entity22 and you look at various international incidents that occurred where there 's attacks on @entity35 civilians or attacks on @entity35 interests where water has been involved , ... we determined that we really do need to expand our capabilities			2
" a year ago , the @entity10 created the @entity9 with a primary mission of gathering evidence after a terrorist attack to help find and prosecute those responsible			1
the team 's ability to operate in contaminated water and to dive at extreme depths sets these divers apart from the @entity10 's existing @entity50 and @entity51			1
a large part of the @entity9 's training is focused on diving in hazardous materials , @entity20 says			1
instead of air tanks , the divers use a hose connected to a surface supply system			0
" it not only provides the air , it collects the air that you exhale and brings it back to the surface , " says @entity60 , the team 's program manager			0
the divers also wear specialized dive suits and old - fashioned hard steel helmets so they can safely operate in contaminated water without being exposed to toxins			1
the new equipment also allows the divers to search a crime scene as deep as 300 feet			0
a safe recreational dive is about 130 feet			0
marine mammals help with counterterrorism the team , which is halfway through its two - year training program , is scheduled to be fully operational by next year , once all its certifications are complete , @entity20 says			1
in the meantime , the divers will perform missions they feel they are capable of doing without high risk of injury			0
a few weeks ago , the team was called to duty after the @entity86 asked the @entity10 for assistance with a case involving a " narco sub , " a semi-submersible vessel regularly used to smuggle drugs			2
when the @entity86 spotted the vessel off the coast of @entity95 , its crew sank the watercraft			0
they were later detained , according to a @entity86 press release			0
" the thought was , ' hey , somebody could go down and retrieve those narcotics , ' " says @entity60			0
" so they called us and we said , ' yep that 's the type of mission we could do			0
' " armed with their state - of - the - art side sonar and their surface air supply system , the @entity10 divers headed to the @entity109 and a blighted , contaminated patch of water , ironically close to a prime recreational dive spot , the world 's second largest barrier reef			1
" once it sunk , diesel ( fuel ) was leaking out into the water , into the cargo hold , " says @entity60			1
in the cargo hold 80 feet below the surface , the divers found nearly 15,000 pounds of cocaine estimated to be worth $ 180 million in street value , according to the @entity86			1
the divers went down in pairs			0
it took eight divers , 15 dives and 24 hours in the water to bring the blocks of tightly packed cocaine to the surface			2
the @entity10 dive team played an " essential " role in locating and recovering the drugs , according to @entity86 lt. cmdr			1
during their mission , the most dangerous threat to the divers did n't come from the hazardous water or the marathon dive session , @entity60 says			2
" our memorable moment was when two divers jumped in the water and a shark came out of nowhere and started swimming around them , " he says			0
the team can only hope that a curious shark remains its most dangerous dive encounter .			0

@entity10 agents are being trained to search for terrorism clues underwater
the @entity156 's training will be complete next year
they wear special dive suits to work in contaminated water
recently , they found 15,000 pounds of cocaine in a sunken cargo hold
