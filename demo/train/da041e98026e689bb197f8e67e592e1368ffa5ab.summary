-- the sun is shining , barbecues are out , beaches are packed and the commute to work is slightly less crowded than normal			2
it can mean only one thing : football 's summer transfer window is upon us			1
most managers hate it , fans are powerless to resist hourly updates on it ; sports journalists worldwide are consumed by it			0
with a further month of fevered speculation , rumor , counter-rumor and downright subterfuge to come before it closes , @entity0 tries to work out what it all means			1
will he , wo n't he ? every summer needs a transfer saga			2
recent tradition tends to place an @entity28 player at the center of a heart - wrenching drama , with dastardly suitors attempting to steal him away from @entity34 's bosom			2
usually , after a summer of emotionally charged hearsay , these players stick around to give the @entity28 boss one more chance to deliver the satisfaction they crave			0
but eventually , as with @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , and @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , the lure of new pastures proves too strong , and the bond is broken			0
this year , in a dramatic break from tradition , it is @entity28 's turn to play the villain in the love triangle , and covet the prized assets of other clubs			2
@entity57 proved to be nothing but a flirt , eventually finding @entity60 more enticing than @entity61			0
while many label him a bad boy , @entity28 now seem only to have eyes for @entity65			1
faint heart , as they say , never won fair maid ; but only time will tell whether @entity28 's seduction technique and slightly eccentric offers of Â £ 40 million , plus one pound , will be enough to tempt the controversial @entity72			0
but none of these great romances can hold a candle to events on the other side of @entity61			0
for weeks @entity78 have been clinging desperately to @entity79 , begging him to remember the good times and promising that a top four finish in the @entity82 can make him happy again			1
@entity83 , meanwhile , have been suggestively whispering that , while he looks great in white , he 'd look even more fabulous in the white of the @entity86 giants			0
certainly the prospect of @entity88 and @entity79 on their respective wings is more than enough to get most @entity91 salivating , but until this week it seemed that @entity78 would keep their man			1
now , however , things have changed ; the latest reports indicate the @entity97 ' passion for @entity79 has cooled sufficiently for them to admit defeat			1
as with many a high - profile divorce , however , the scale of the pay - off should at least help to wipe away their tears			1
vive la revolution ! @entity105 was when the mere suggestion @entity107 or @entity108 were interested in a player pretty much put an end to transfer speculation ; indeed , when @entity113 indicated he was ready to leave @entity60 behind him , @entity112 seemed his inevitable destination			2
to the surprise of many , however , the towering striker opted to join the newly minted @entity118 champions , @entity117 , instead			1
the @entity82 may still believe itself to be the world 's best , but this summer 's evidence shows that its spending power may be diminishing			1
what 's more , the traditional big three @entity123 leagues -- @entity112 , @entity125 and @entity126 -- can no longer have it all their own way			1
for a start the @entity129 has already demonstrated its strength on and off the pitch , with trophies and multi-million dollar transfer fees alike			2
@entity136 's @entity135 , however , is making a surprise bid to join the giants			0
the resurgence of @entity140 , and their favorable tax rules for foreigners , has added a new string to the @entity118 elite 's increasingly impressive bow			1
alongside their @entity149 - backed @entity148 rivals , @entity140 are simply outbidding the big spenders , leaving the likes of @entity107 -- who they also beat to the signature of @entity154 -- scratching their heads			1
suddenly , @entity118 football seems a lot more interesting , and @entity160 's billionaire - backed @entity158 a little less potent			1
austerity is for normal people all over @entity123 , austerity is biting hard			1
unemployment , particularly among the young , is at eye - watering levels , and belts are being tightened accordingly			2
in @entity112 , where former @entity82 perennials @entity168 have become the latest club to hit skid row , fans have also been protesting at high ticket prices			1
all the signs should point to a more sensible age of spending in the game			0
of course , we 're talking about football here though -- a world where almost nothing makes any sense whatsoever			2
so while @entity125 unemployment lines grow , talk of @entity83 paying a record - obliterating $ 120 million for a player many argue they do n't really need seems absolutely genuine			2
in fact , according to a @entity188 report , transfer spending over the first six months of 2013 sharply increased , while the list of multi-million dollar deals in this summer 's window grows almost daily			2
it remains to be seen whether spending in 2013 will set new records , but do n't bet against it			0
are you itk ? everyone likes a bit of juicy gossip , and starved of the usual stuff to talk about , football fans in summer are particularly susceptible to a little tittle - tattle			1
the inexorable rise of @entity206 has spawned a wave of people claiming to be " itk " ( " in the know " ) -- particularly supposed agents			0
the most notorious of these fakes unmasked himself last year , but only after his ( completely fabricated ) rumors had found their way into the mainstream media			0
one hapless fan even bought a shirt with the name of an apparently done - deal transfer emblazoned on it			1
these days it is often hard to tell whether the rumor you have picked up on social media is anything more than a mischievous hoax , but fake agents are not just found on @entity206			0
a more insidious breed is also playing a highly damaging role in some young footballers ' careers			0
the problem is particularly acute in @entity233 , where an international scouting camp has been set up to help young players find genuine agents and avoid being exploited by chancers			0
even experienced players can be hoodwinked , as @entity240 striker @entity239 discovered to his cost earlier this year			0
the @entity242 was sacked after details of an overly candid phone call with a man purporting to be an agent were made public , to the anger of his employers			0
footballers have feelings too @entity252 is " angry " and " confused "			0
@entity79 is " horrified " and " distraught "			1
meanwhile @entity34 apparently experiences every defeat " like a death " , so who knows how the @entity118 is coping as @entity28 keep missing out on their transfer targets			1
footballers and their agents , managers and chairmen have been reaching for their thesauruses in an attempt to convey the sheer emotional turmoil that the transfer window brings			2
there are safety issues for the general public too : back in 2006 @entity271 almost " crashed his car in disgust " when he heard @entity28 were only prepared to offer him Â £ 55,000 a week , rather than the Â £ 60,000 he had his heart set upon			0
top footballers are fragile creatures			0
during this unsettling period , as they are forced to endure exotic beach holidays and wonder just how much money might be on the table , one really has to feel for them			0
still , with just a matter of weeks to go until the window closes , calm will soon be restored - at least until it reopens on january 1st , and the whole astonishing business gets underway once again .			1

the @entity123 football *season* has two transfer windows
one runs in the off*season* , the other throughout the month of january
@entity79 and @entity65 are two high - profile @entity82 stars linked with moves
