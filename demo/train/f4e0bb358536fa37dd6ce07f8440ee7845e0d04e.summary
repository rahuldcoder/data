-- more than 130 unmarked graves at a former convent discovered in @entity3 in 1993 first brought to public consciousness the plight of thousands of women forced to work at @entity8 - run workhouses in @entity9 -- an ugly legacy that 's the focus of a new report from the @entity9 government			1
the report , released tuesday , acknowledges that @entity9 's government sent thousands of women and girls to " harsh and physically demanding " workhouses known as @entity17 , where they worked and lived without pay , sometimes for years			1
the laundries operated from 1922 to 1996			2
" the psychological impact on these girls was undoubtedly traumatic and lasting , " the @entity9 government - backed investigatory committee found			1
the report also said , " many of the women who met with the committee -- and particularly those who entered the @entity28 as young girls -- experienced the laundries as lonely and frightening places			1
" " for too long , they have been and have felt forgotten			2
indeed for many of them , an inability to share their story in the years after their time in a @entity34 has only added to the confusion and pain they feel about that period in their lives			2
" the committee highlighted the stigma attached to their plight , saying that " the chronicle of the @entity17 was for many years characterised primarily by secrecy , silence and shame			2
" as a result , the women admitted there " have for too long felt the social stigma of what was sometimes cruelly called the ' fallen woman			1
' this is a wholly inaccurate characterisation , hurtful to them and their families , that is not borne out by the facts			0
" but contrary to survivors ' testimony published by advocacy groups , the report did not find physical abuse or torture to be a feature of the laundries			1
it also found no evidence that women were sexually abused , but acknowledged that it had spoken to only a fraction of those concerned			1
the report 's authors said the four orders of nuns who ran the laundries said they had kept many details quiet out of a desire to protect the women 's privacy , and that they had sought to provide for the marginalized and disadvantaged , rather than profiting from the laundries			1
about 10,000 women worked in the so - called @entity28 , or @entity34 , @entity17 over seven decades -- and more than a quarter of them were referred there by the state , for various reasons including by the courts as a condition of probation , according to the report			1
others were unmarried mothers , victims of sexual abuse , orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state , or had mental or physical disabilities			1
some were simply admitted by the families for reasons not known			0
responding to its findings , @entity9 's taoiseach , or prime minister , @entity103 said he was sorry for the stigma the women had suffered and the conditions they endured in the convent - run laundries			1
but he did not give the formal apology many of the women have called for			1
survivors ' groups say the women were physically and psychologically abused , denied an education and detained against their will -- and insist they are owed a formal government apology and compensation			1
with many now advanced in age , they also want the state to provide pensions for the years they worked without pay			2
for years , their situation was shrouded in mystery , with details coming to light only in the past two decades			0
the government - backed investigatory committee , chaired by sen. @entity133 , was established in response to a call by the @entity136			0
its findings will be debated by the @entity9 parliament later this month			1
it found " evidence of direct @entity146 involvement " in numerous aspects of the 10 laundries ' operation			0
the report 's authors spoke to about 100 women who had worked in the laundries between the foundation of the @entity9 state in 1922 and the closure of the last of the workhouses in 1996			1
about 60 % of the women spent less than a year there , the committee found			2
advocacy group @entity159 together said the women concerned had been " let down " by the committee			1
one , @entity162 , said : " it was worse than any prison , and i 'll never ever get over it			0
i 'll go to my grave with this pain , it was soul destroying , and the pain will never leave me			0
" the government and the religious should stand up and acknowledge what they did to us and the scars that they left , and the pain that will never ever go away			0
" survivor testimony published by the justice for @entity182 campaign group also depicted the workhouses as harsh and exploitative places			2
" in the @entity34 laundry , it was a well - known fact that once you went in there you never came out , " one woman told the group			0
" you could n't walk out , because all the locks would be on the doors			0
unless family of yours took you out			0
say somebody claimed you , and took you out			0
then that was the only way , or else you 'd go out in a coffin , you know ? you died there			0
" those who escaped the convent walls have had no easy time either , the group said			0
in a 2011 submission to the @entity204 highlighted the dire situation in which many of the survivors still find themselves , years later			0
" their poverty has been exacerbated throughout their lives by the denial of educational opportunity which they suffered while incarcerated in the laundries , as well as the psychological and physical injury caused by the abuse , " it said			0
" nor have the women received healthcare or education to assist them in overcoming their trauma and abuse			2
" there is a dearth of personal records of the women , and they continue to feel constrained and silenced by a deep sense of stigma and shame over their incarceration in the @entity34 , because of the continued denial of justice , lack of inquiry , and lack of acknowledgment that they were not at fault for what they suffered but instead had a grave abuse perpetrated upon them			2
" the lack of personal records has also made it difficult for the adopted children of those locked up in the laundries to trace their mothers			0
the last of the @entity17 closed in 1996			0
an act passed in 2002 addressed abuse and neglect suffered by thousands of @entity9 children in state - licensed residential homes and schools , but omitted those who 'd suffered in the @entity260 .			1

about 10,000 women were sent to work in the @entity28 , a report finds
more than a quarter were referred there by the @entity9 state , it finds
advocacy groups say the women were seriously abused and *deserve* compensation
the report finds conditions were " harsh and physically demanding " but not abusive
