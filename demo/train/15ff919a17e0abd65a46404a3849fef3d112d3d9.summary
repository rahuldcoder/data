-- for 70 years , survivors of the december 7 , 1941 , attack on @entity3 have captivated listeners with their firsthand accounts , recalling buddies who died in their arms or the glasses worn by a low - flying @entity10 pilot			1
they have participated in solemn wreath - laying ceremonies and spoken to civic groups and school children about the infamous day and the need for the @entity15 to remain vigilant			2
but the gradual loss of the @entity20 generation has accelerated , and this year , perhaps more than any before it , evidence of a tide change is inescapable			1
the @entity22 , founded in 1958 , is dissolving december 31			2
the passing of time , the difficulty in finding chapter officers and the health of its 2,700 members have taken their toll			1
" we do n't like to see it happen , " said @entity29 , 87 , the organization 's national secretary and a @entity3 survivor			1
" but we do n't have young members coming in like other organizations			1
" informal social and local activities will continue , he said			2
about 84,000 uniformed @entity15 were on @entity38 that fateful day			1
only an estimated 8,000 are alive today -- and they are in their late 80s and older			2
children and grandchildren have stepped up to carry the flag of their forefathers			2
the @entity43 of @entity22 , with about 20 chapters , is helping to " carry on the legacy left to us , " said national president @entity47 , whose father served at the @entity50 's @entity49 during the attack			1
large , like others , is concerned that most @entity15 schoolchildren today know almost nothing about the surprise attack that pulverized battleships and aircraft stationed at @entity58			2
flying from aircraft carriers , @entity10 pilots attacked eight battleships , destroying two , and left a trail of death and destruction across the verdant landscape			2
about 2,400 people , most of them in the military , were killed			2
the attack shook @entity15 's confidence and ushered the country into @entity20 about 120 @entity3 survivors are registered to attend wednesday morning 's annual memorial ceremony			1

" we were able in the past to ( tell the story ) through the mouths of those who saw it , " said @entity87 , spokeswoman for @entity88 , an organization that assists the @entity89			2
" now , we are showing it through experts who studied it over the years			1
" among others traveling to @entity58 are families of two servicemen who died in the past two years			1
remains of @entity103 , 91 , of @entity104 , @entity105 , will be interred wednesday in the battleship @entity106 , on which he served and where 1,117 sailors and @entity109 died in the attack			1
those of @entity112 , 90 , of @entity113 , @entity114 , will be carried tuesday by a diver to the @entity116 , which also is entombed off @entity117			2
" i think it 's pretty awesome that we are getting to do this , " said daughter @entity118			1

a blu - ray version of the the 1970 film " @entity147 ! @entity148 ! @entity148 ! " with extended footage , was to be shown sunday evening at the @entity149 , near the @entity106			2
historians say the passage of time is allowing for a broader , more objective look at the attack			2
research has provided new insights , particularly about the @entity10 perspectives and source material on the attack			2
in recent years , interpretation also has shifted its focus " from engagement to peace , " with recognition that both sides fought a " savage war , " said @entity167 , chief historian at the @entity168 in the @entity84			1

" he was looking out the port window and saw what he thought would be his last day there			2
he saw these planes coming in			2
he thought it must be the @entity109 because nobody else would be working on sunday			2
" the @entity116 was quickly disabled			2
