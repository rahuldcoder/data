-- [ breaking new update 6:32 p.m. et ] @entity2 defeats @entity3 2 -1 in extra time as @entity3 comeback failed to gain traction			1
[ breaking new update 6:18 p.m. et ] @entity3 fires back with goal			1
@entity2 2 , @entity3 1			1
[ breaking new update 6:12 p.m. et ] @entity2 scores second goal on @entity3 in extra time			1
[ breaking new update 6:00 p.m. et ] @entity2 scores on @entity3 to take lead 1 - 0			1
[ breaking new update 5:51 p.m. et ] @entity3 and @entity2 enter extra time after two scoreless halves			1
[ breaking new update 5:25 p.m. et ] @entity3 and @entity2 remain scoreless in the second half			1
[ @entity15 previously published 6:39 a.m. ] ok , so the @entity3 lost to @entity16 , but still squeezed through to the next round			1
but nothing to be too proud of either			0
but the game today ? this is do or die			2
this is one and done			0
this is all or nothing			0
this is whatever cliche you can think of to rabble rouse your team spirit			0
if the @entity3 - @entity16 match was a battle of @entity33 , this afternoon 's encounter is @entity34 and the @entity35			1
and @entity2 ai n't no one trick pony			1
the game 's at 4 p.m. et -- enough time for you to skim through this cheat sheet and become an insta - pundit			2
why you should care it 's about time soccer caught on in the @entity3 and in order for that to happen , @entity3 need a team they can really rally behind			1
if the boys can beat @entity2 , it 's off to the quarter finals of the @entity50			1
the last time the men 's team did that was in 2002			0
( they lost to @entity16			0
) the expectations are enormous			0
when was the last time you saw the country unite behind one cause , gather in front of massive tv screens , and collectively bellow , " i believe that we will win " ? at home , 25 million people watched the @entity3 nearly slay @entity66 last week			1
twenty five million ! that 's more than what the @entity69 finals or the @entity70 averaged			0
in @entity72 , @entity3 are second only to the host nation in the number of tickets bought			1
@entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 are blowing up			0
soccer , you see , is starting to stir the soul of @entity82			0
" the country is paying attention in a way that it 's never done before , and we have a chance to make some history , " said @entity83 , the @entity84 president			0
it 'd be a shame if the plucky @entity94 lost to @entity2 , killing the momentum			1
how @entity82 won the @entity96 how it has played out before when the @entity3 last played @entity2 at the @entity50 , it beat them 3 - 0			1
but that was 84 years ago -- in 1930 ! more recently , the teams played two " friendlies " ( matches that are n't part of a tournament )			1
why you should worry you do n't hear @entity2 mentioned in the same breath as soccer powerhouses like @entity72 , @entity108 or @entity16			1
that 's because it is n't			0
it plays a boring brand of soccer			0
'' i am here to be a realist , " their coach , @entity119 , says			0
" i am not here to please the fans in the stands			0
" but @entity2 wins games			1
it qualified for the @entity50 , winning eight out of 10 games			1
( it drew the other two			0
) at the tournament , it 's won all three of its games , conceding only one goal			2
another reason : the @entity129 are young and hungry			0
eleven of their players are in the prestigious @entity133			0
four of the @entity3 play there			1
also , @entity2 has way too many strong goal - scorers			1
glossary for the budding @entity3 @entity50 fan why you should n't worry @entity139 : the @entity140 are banged up			1
captain @entity141 ca n't seem to shake a nagging groin injury			0
so he 's iffy for the game			0
@entity141 is one of @entity2 's key defenders			1
a second starting defender has a hamstring strain			0
without those two , the goal scoring potential increases for the @entity3 and they 're not the only ones battling injury			1
there 's one guy with a broken leg , another with a groin strain , another with muscle tightness			0
deux : @entity158 will be back for the @entity3 since he was sidelined with a hamstring injury in the @entity3 opener against @entity161 , @entity157 has had to go it alone as the main goal scorer			1
@entity158 returns to the potent partnership			0
@entity165 : there 's something to be said for experience			0
and the @entity3 has four players who are @entity50 veterans ( @entity170 , @entity157 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
) they know how to deal with the pressures of competing on soccer 's biggest stage			0
the @entity140 ? the last time they were at a @entity50 was 14 years ago			1
" we have absolutely no fear at all , " @entity3 coach @entity178 said			2
" we believe we have built a foundation in our team that we are able to beat them , and we 're looking forward to it			0
" what you should ignore the fact that the referee is @entity189			0
ever since @entity191 picked @entity192 for the match , the comments have poured in : " we 're toast			0
" why ? because the @entity3 knocked @entity195 out of the @entity196 with a 1 - 0 victory			2
@entity178 's got a second reason : he seems to think that the fact that the ref speaks @entity201 gives the @entity140 an edge			2
" is it a good feeling ? no , " he said			0
" he 's able to speak @entity201 with their players on the field , not with us			0
and it 's the country that we beat in the last second of the last @entity50			2
" will @entity192 hold a grudge ? hogwash			0
he 's refereed the @entity215 - @entity214 game and the @entity218 - @entity217 game without complaints from fans or critics about wrong calls			0
" it is looking for excuses ahead of the match , " @entity140 coach @entity223 said			2
what the @entity3 should do attack , attack , attack ! in the last three games , the boys attacked just 72 times , says @entity191			1
you know where that places the @entity3 among the 32 teams at the @entity50 ? dead last ! today , the natural tendency of the team might be to hunker down , ward off the inevitable @entity140 onslaught , and make a run for the goal when chances open up			1
this is n't the group round			0
you lose here , you 're out			0
all of @entity2 's goals have come in the last 20 minutes of games , making it hard for the opposing team to equalize			1
so the @entity3 needs to go at it guns blazing			2
yes , the @entity129 have won their @entity50 games so far , but they never quite dominated			1
what you should say here are some fun facts to impress your buddies at your soccer watching party : fun fact # 1 : before he became @entity2 's coach , @entity119 served in the country 's senate for two years			2
fun fact # 2 : @entity2 's most notable contribution to cinema is @entity270			2
fun fact # 3 : @entity272 is calling for a ban on @entity140 waffles			2
that 's not even a @entity140 invention			2
@entity277 ! fun fact # 4 : @entity280 sprouts actually do get their name from the @entity140 capital			2
fun fact # 5 : @entity157 has another goal : to make it as rapper @entity286			0
his 13 - track album , " @entity288 , " comes out after the @entity50			2
who will win the folks at @entity291 give the @entity3 a 42 % chance of winning			1
the @entity140 coach pegs his team 's chances at 50 - 50			2
the @entity3 quotes @entity296 : " the best way to predict your future is to create it			2
" off the field : the men of the @entity302 @entity191 : @entity3 @entity50 fans most active online			1
