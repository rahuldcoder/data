-- @entity2 player representatives and the league 's owners on monday signed a collective - bargaining agreement to end a lockout that threatened to derail the 2011 season			1
" @entity9 's back ! " @entity2 @entity10 exclaimed at a news conference in @entity12 after the agreement was signed , ending the four - month lockout			1
he said the 10 - year agreement " is extraordinarily great for our game			2
" the agreement was signed after members of the @entity20 unanimously approved the deal offered by the league 's 32 owners early monday			2
chief among the issues embraced in the deal was the main issue of the lockout -- how to divide the $ 9 billion the @entity2 takes in each year			1
under the old agreement , @entity2 owners took $ 1 billion off the top of that revenue stream			1
after that , the players got about 60 %			0
the owners said the old labor deal did n't take into account the rising costs related to building stadiums and promoting the game			0
the players argued that the league had not sufficiently opened up its books to prove this			0
" we managed to talk about things that make football better and safer , " @entity20 executive director @entity45 told reporters on monday			0
" there are a number of issues that ( needed ) to be considered			0
... the good thing is , the only way to talk about these things is if you 're a union			0
" the compensation issue was resolved when both side embraced an " all revenue system " as the basis for player compensation , according to an @entity20 news release			1
under the system , the floor for the players ' share of the revenue is set at 47 %			1
the deal sets the salary cap at about $ 120.4 million per club -- plus $ 22 million in benefits for performance - based pay in 2011			1
this includes a guarantee for the league as a whole to spend no less than 99 % of the cap in 2011 and 2012 , and no less than 95 % in consecutive four - year periods thereafter			2
both sides over the weekend discussed details that players wanted resolved , including the contractual handling of player injury , an opt - out clause in the 10 - year deal and , " most pointedly , the potential timeline for the recertification of the @entity20 ( @entity2 @entity87 ) as a union , " the @entity2 said			1
in a bid to reduce injuries , the pact eliminated " two - a - day " practices , set a maximum of 4.5 hours on - field per day during training camp , and limited full - contact practices to an average of one per week not exceeding three hours			1
it also allows for unannounced inspections by @entity20 staff to ensure compliance			0
it also limits off - season workout requirements			0
player representative @entity103 acknowledged that the lockout " has been ( a ) roller coaster for the fans , " but he echoed the cheerfulness from both sides : " with dialogue , things began to happen , " said saturday , a center for the @entity112 , " and ... now instead of these meeting rooms , i get to be in football meeting rooms ( at training camp )			0
" with the signing of the deal , the clock begins to roll on the 2011 season , beginning with the league 's publication of its free agency list			2
the rest of the week will be dominated by the deferred business of expanding rosters , signing drafted rookies , reopening facilities and starting camps in preparation for preseason games , the first of which are on august 11 , according to an updated league schedule released monday			1
the only confirmed casualty of the lockout is the annual @entity135 , which was canceled because of the delay in opening camps , @entity10 said			2
the game , which this year was to be between the @entity139 and @entity140 , had been scheduled for august 7			0
the regular season is set to open on september 8			0
the league 's owners imposed the lockout on march 11 , suspending the labor deal in place at the time in hopes of creating a new financial structure			0
ten players , including marquee quarterbacks @entity150 , @entity152 and @entity153 , subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league on behalf of other current and eligible @entity2 athletes			2
a judge in early april joined that action with another filed by retired players			0
after the lockout , the two sides faced off in courts and around conference tables			0
the issues revolved around how to divide the billions of dollars of revenue reaped via the league each year , rules of free agency , the rookie wage scale , retirement benefits and a host of other matters			1
according to the @entity20 , the deal , among other things : -- raises the minimum salary by $ 55,000 a year from 2010 , with increases each year through 2014 by that year , the @entity2 's lowest salary will be $ 420,000			1
-- sets the overall limit on rookie compensation at $ 874 million in 2011 ( increasing with salary cap ) ; -- sets minimum pay for high draft picks at a graduated scale based on average pay of the highest - paid players at those positions ; -- sets mandatory contracts lengths at four years for players drafted in the first seven rounds ; -- guarantees contracts against injury for up to three years ; -- creates a $ 610 million @entity192 for players who played before the 1993 season ; -- allows the @entity20 discretionary use of $ 20 million per year for health , safety and " former player issues ; " -- calls for a three - member appeals panel , including at least one former judge , to resolve disputes .			1
