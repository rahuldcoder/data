calling all @entity0 in @entity1 : would you like a free trip around the world ? @entity6 resident @entity5 , 28 , is looking for a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to take a couple of airline tickets off his hands			1
@entity5 posted on @entity13 that he booked this " fairly wicked " trip in march when he and the original @entity15 were still together			1
after they broke up , he did n't want the tickets to go to waste			2
" anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible , " he wrote on the site			0
if you 're lucky enough to be @entity1 and have the name @entity15 , here is your itinerary : december 21 : @entity29 to @entity30 december 28 : @entity31 to @entity32 december 29 : @entity32 to @entity33 january 7 : @entity33 to @entity34 january 8 : @entity34 to @entity6 oh , and if you want to stay a few extra days in @entity37 , that 's an option too , @entity5 says			1
" i am not looking for anything in return			0
i am not looking for companionship , romance , drugs , a trade , or to take selfies with you in front of the @entity47 in @entity31 , " he wrote			0
" if you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks , great			0
really the only thing i ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness			2
" better hurry , though			0
@entity5 says he has received thousands of emails from around the world in response to his @entity13 post , including " dozens of emails from @entity58 who are @entity1			1
" no word on how he 's going to make the final selection			0
there 's probably not enough time before the trip to do it " @entity66 " style			1
the real question is whether it 's possible for another @entity15 to travel under a ticket purchased for @entity5 's ex. airline policies typically forbid the transfer of tickets , but in this case , how would they know ? @entity5 says he booked it on @entity76 using @entity15 's first and last name only ( no middle name )			1
and we know security agents at the airport generally do n't check birth dates , which are required to purchase a ticket			0
@entity84 has reached out to the @entity85 to find out whether they have any security measures in place that would prevent @entity15 2.0 from traveling .			2
