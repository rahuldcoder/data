responding to the massacre at the @entity3 satirical magazine @entity2 , president @entity4 and other public figures such as @entity6 , author @entity7 -- even the far - right nationalist @entity3 politician @entity6 -- have defended the right to freedom of expression as a core democratic value			1
huge demonstrations in solidarity with the victims are occurring throughout @entity3 and in many @entity16 capitals			1
the slogan " je suis @entity2 " is circulating widely in social media			0
@entity20 is inundated with tweets about the political power of satire			0
pictures of demonstrators holding pens in the air abound			0
freedom of expression is undeniably worth defending but is too narrow a frame for this event			0
with this horrific event , @entity31 may well have become the front - runner in @entity3 's 2017 presidential elections			1
these killings will reverberate throughout the shaky @entity36 , where nationalist parties of all stripes are warning of the dangers of too much immigration			1
the political mood in @entity16 has been growing dark			1
volatility is becoming more and more constant			0
in december , the @entity44 government went into a crisis triggered by the right nationalist @entity46 , which are vehemently opposed to more immigration and whose leader recently proclaimed that @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 were not @entity44 unless they assimilated			1
a last - minute compromise among the major parties saved the day in @entity44 , but the @entity46 -- whose electoral share went from 6 % in 2010 to 13 % in 2014 -- are not leaving the scene			1
in @entity60 , where the openly neo-nazi party @entity61 has been in the parliament since 2012 , the @entity59 government came apart and the prime minister has called snap elections for january 25			0
in @entity67 , a group called @entity66 staged large demonstrations in @entity69 against the " @entity70			0
" prime minister @entity74 in her @entity72 's address told the group to stop its demonstrations , but @entity77 staged another one in @entity69 anyway			2
@entity31 's goal since she became head of the @entity82 in 2011 has been to make it a mainstream party			2
in 2014 , it moved from one electoral breakthrough to another			0
in march it won mayoral races in four @entity3 municipalities , including the traditionally socialist city of @entity91			0
in may , it came in first place in the @entity16 parliamentary elections -- which saw an uptick in the fortunes of right nationalist parties throughout @entity16			1
@entity31 has consistently polled well as a contender in the 2017 @entity3 presidential elections			0
even before the @entity2 attack , it was more than likely that she would make it to the second round in 2017			2
in an october public opinion poll , she outpolled @entity3 president @entity107 by 15 percentage points			0
her closest rival was former @entity3 president @entity110 , and she outpolled even him			0
the international media often present her as a single - issue candidate around xenophobia and immigration , but @entity31 's and the front 's positions have expanded considerably			1
her father , @entity117 , the former head of the party , began a strong push against further @entity16 integration and @entity3 involvement in the @entity122			2
unemployment outpaces immigration as the leading problem in public opinion polls			0
but politicians take opportunities where they see them , and voters tend to remember dramatic events as well as everyday grievances			0
nothing could be more dramatic than the public killings of 12 persons in the center of @entity137			2
they may well become a tipping point -- @entity16 's 21st - century version of a @entity142 moment			1
@entity16 has been convulsing for the last few years			2
the sovereign debt crisis , the high youth unemployment rates , the failure to come up with a just and reasonable refugee policy -- all these issues may crystalize around of the event in @entity137 whether they are directly related or not			1
the nationalist right has been gaining strength all over @entity16 on just these issues			1
the @entity2 massacre will not only help @entity6 but will be a boon to nationalist parties throughout @entity16			1
from north to south , ordinary @entity16 citizens are already voting for parties that they had shunned in the past			1
if this trend continues , there will be no guns of august -- just the silent assault of one nationalist electoral success after another .			2

@entity166 : @entity137 attack will boost far - right 's calls for *brakes* on immigration
she says attack is tipping point -- a troubling boon to nationalist parties in @entity16
