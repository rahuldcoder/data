-- more and more airlines are teaming up with world - class chefs , hoping to solve that ultimate # firstworldproblem : how to serve a top - rate meal in the air			1
the strategy seems to be to throw glamorous , big - name chefs at the problem and hope that they can recreate on planes that same gastronomic magic they do at their restaurants			2
celebrity chef @entity12 helped @entity13 with a special @entity15 in - flight menu in 2012 ; @entity16 and @entity17 have made headlines with their collaboration , which began in 2011			2
the @entity21 @entity20 has also been tasked with creating a first - class menu for @entity23			1
their @entity25 restaurant , @entity27 , is famous for creative @entity25 cooking and recently received one @entity30 star after @entity31 took over as executive chef			1
@entity31 was asked to whip up a gourmet menu that will work at 30,000 feet above sea level			1
he went one step further : @entity31 is serving the same in - flight meal at @entity27 as a special four - course " first class menu " costing hk $ 1,400 ( $ 180 ) per head			1
airplane food served at an expensive restaurant ? @entity31 admits it 's not the easiest sell			1
" i agree that in - flight food has a bad reputation			1
i also find most of it terrible , " says the chef			0
@entity48 ambitions he says @entity21 's height inspired the menu			0
the hotel is nearly 500 meters ( 1,640 feet ) above ground , earning it the superlative of " world 's highest hotel , " and bringing its guests close to a mid-air experience , without them getting on a plane			2
the two menus -- in - flight and on the ground -- ca n't be exactly the same however			0
@entity31 says the idea of recreating gourmet restaurant experiences in the air will only ever be a concept			1
in reality , it will never be replicated			0
" the meal served on the plane , it 's cooked by somebody else , it 's prepared eight to 12 hours ahead of time , it 's mass production , " says @entity31			1
in other words , it is n't the personalized , fussy cooking of a top - notch restaurant			1
but the biggest problem is an airline 's concern for food safety , which trumps the customer 's desire for deliciousness			1
" everything has to be pasteurized , and you ca n't use raw tuna or raw beef , " says @entity31			2
the chef serves high - quality beef carpaccio on both his in flight and restaurant menus			2
the one at the restaurant is a traditional @entity25 appetizer of thick slices of tender raw beef paired with ricotta and a perky tomato jam			0
the same dish on the plane has to be tweaked to get around food safety regulations : the beef is seared first , so it is n't really a carpaccio anymore			1
for connoisseurs , it would be the equivalent of adding water to aged whiskey			0
do n't count on the bread " my food costs are 45 %			0
i have given my food supplier list to @entity23 and i believe they use the exact same ingredients as i do at @entity27 , " says @entity31 , who has had to adjust many of the other ingredients so the dishes can withstand storage and re-heating			1
one item that made the chef throw in the towel was the bread			0
" it is quite tricky to make it crunchy and nice , you have to reheat it , on a flight that is basically impossible to do			0
the airline caterers have done a decent job considering it is baked 15 hours in advance , but it 's not ' wow , ' " he says			0
the chef is also taking a deeper look at the overall experience for gourmets			0
at the restaurant , the experience is a gradual build - up to a crescendo of a main dish			2
the chef would temper the first few courses so the diner is not overwhelmed			0
" from start to end , you have to keep the interest of the customer , " says @entity31			2
on a flight , it 's a shorter meal , with @entity31 's special main course competing with other regular offerings			2
the chef makes sure to dial up the flavors of his main dish , including the tastiest , most intense ingredients			0
" i only have one chance to impress the customer			0
i have to be spot on , " he says			0
@entity23 's partnership with @entity31 and @entity27 runs until july 31 , 2014 , on various long - haul and regional flights departing @entity20 .			1

can fine - dining experiences really be *pulled* off at 30,000 feet ? some airlines think so .
@entity23 partners with @entity31 from @entity30 - starred @entity20 restaurant @entity27
some *recipes* have to be tweaked to meet food safety regulations
