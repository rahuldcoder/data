the rock stars of the ' 60s and ' 70s have , inevitably , gotten older			0
many are now in their 70s ; some have even passed on			0
@entity6 still sees them as vigorous youths			2
" i feel very lucky that i was part of that whole scene in the ' 60s and ' 70s , " she says in a phone interview from her home in @entity10			0
" i love looking at the photographs because everyone was young , and they were so gorgeous to look at			2
" " the photographs " are the pictures that @entity17 , 69 , took of many of the era 's notables -- including her former husbands , @entity22 and @entity23			1
as @entity22 's wife , she was there when the @entity28 went through the frenzy of @entity30 , the journeys of psychedelia and mysticism and the crumbling of their partnership			1
with @entity23 -- who ardently pursued her for years -- she witnessed a guitarist at the peak of his solo fame as well as his struggle with addiction			2
she was married to @entity22 from 1966 to 1977 and @entity23 from 1979 to 1989			1
@entity17 's photographs , including many of the @entity28 and @entity23 , went on display at the @entity44 on tuesday and will remain on exhibit until march 15			1
the photos capture a rare intimacy and casualness			1
the @entity28 are photographed on their 1968 visit to @entity50 , with the group looking relaxed and happy			0
in another picture , @entity23 grins at fellow guitarist @entity53 in 1974			2
then there 's one of @entity22 in the early ' 90s , clutching a ukulele -- a favorite instrument of the @entity28 guitarist , who died in 2001			1
some of the photographs only recently turned up , says @entity17			1
" i 'm quite a sloppy person as far as working out where all my negatives and slides are , " she says			0
one of them pictures a group setting up the stage for " @entity67 , " the 1976 @entity44 concert filmed by @entity69			2
@entity17 , who wrote a memoir in 2007 , says there 's some emotion underneath the pictures , even decades later			1
( after all , she inspired a number of songs on @entity23 's " @entity82 " album , his way of channeling the anguish he felt for loving his best friend 's wife			1
) but it 's not necessarily sorrow or longing			0
the pictures also bring back a lot of happiness , she says			0
many @entity22 photos , particularly one from late 1967 , show him at ease , before the agonies of the @entity28 ' business troubles took root			2
and @entity23 never looks happier than when he 's on stage : " he never , never , never had stage nerves			1
in the middle of a conversation ( he 'd say ) , ' oh , i 've got to go on now , ' and just walk on as if he were walking into his home			0
" she understands that -- despite time in front of the camera herself , as a model for the likes of @entity107 -- she 'll probably always be looked at in the context of her famous mates			0
" i ca n't rewrite history , " she says			0
" i 'll always be linked to the @entity28 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
" it does n't hurt , however , that she 'll always see them as young and beautiful			0
" we all get a bit older , " she says , " but , you know , i 'm so glad that i have these photos			0
