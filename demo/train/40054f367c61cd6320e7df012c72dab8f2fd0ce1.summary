@entity0 , @entity1 -- religious materials -- including qurans that were burned at @entity6 in @entity1 , sparking @entity1 protests -- were removed from the library of a detainee center " because of extremist inscriptions " on them , a military official said tuesday			1
there was " an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications , " a military official said			1
" additionally , some of the documents were extremist in and of themselves , apparently originating from outside of @entity1 , " the official said			1
the official said the material was burned , but authorities are attempting to determine how much			2
the uproar prompted gen. @entity26 , commander of @entity24 's @entity27 , to issue a directive " that all coalition forces in @entity1 will complete training in the proper handling of religious materials no later than march 3 , " the @entity24 - led force said			1
. the training will include " the identification of religious materials , their significance , correct handling and storage , " according to the statement from coalition forces			1
earlier tuesday , @entity26 said the materials were gathered for disposal from the airfield 's @entity42 and inadvertently given to troops for burning			1
" this was not a decision that was made because they were religious materials , " he said			1
" it was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of @entity52			0
the moment we found out about it , we immediately stopped and we intervened			0
" hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the airfield tuesday , furious over reports of the burning			0
lt. @entity61 , a spokeswoman for the coalition forces , told @entity2 in an e-mail earlier tuesday that an investigation was under way to determine whether any material was burned before the mistake was discovered and , if so , how much			2
" we are deeply concerned about the report of qurans or religious materials being damaged , and will get to the bottom of what actually happened , " she said			1
but a coalition official acknowledged the materials were improperly burned			1
@entity26 said he immediately launched an investigation			1
" something like this just can not happen again , " @entity26 said			1
@entity78 regard the @entity79 as the absolute word of @entity81			1
it is so highly revered that many @entity78 will not pick up the holy book without ablution , a ritual washing of the hands			1
desecrating the book , such as burning it , is therefore seen as an unforgivable affront -- as an act of intolerance and bigotry			2
authorities are looking into the reasons why the material was gathered and why the decision was made " to dispose of them in this manner , " @entity26 said			1
some troops have been questioned , but there have been no arrests or detentions , according to a coalition official			2
@entity1 officials have been invited to join the investigation			2
@entity26 said he has offered " sincere apologies " to @entity1 officials , including president @entity106			1
@entity26 also offered apologies to the @entity1 government and " the noble people of @entity1			1
" " this was unintentional , " he said			0
" there was no intention by any member of @entity27 to defame the faith of @entity52 or to desecrate the precious religious materials of this faith			1
" " the materials recovered will be properly handled by appropriate religious authorities , " @entity26 said earlier			1
local citizens who work at the base discovered the material that had been put into a burn pit by @entity24 personnel and alerted officials			1
soon after , demonstrators massed outside the base , chanting " death to @entity127 ! death to the @entity1 government ! long live @entity52 ! " as a @entity24 helicopter circled overhead and black smoke billowed from the ground , men shook their fists in anger			2
several men launched slingshots in the direction of the base			0
" the desecration of religious articles is not in keeping with the standards of @entity127 tolerance , human rights practices and freedom of religion , " @entity141 spokeswoman @entity140 said tuesday			0
" the concern is that some around the world will think that this represents an affirmative statement by the @entity127 , and it does not represent our values or our view of how the @entity79 ought to be treated , " she said			2
@entity26 said , " this is not who we are			2
these are very , very isolated incidents			0
we 've been here a long time			0
we 've been shoulder to shoulder with the @entity1 for a long time			0
we 've been dying alongside the @entity1 for a long time because we believe in them			0
we believe in their country			0
we want to have every opportunity to give them a bright future			0
" but " these kinds of incidents , when they do occur , we will move quickly to correct them , " he said			0
" we will move quickly to hold people accountable			0
" photographs surfaced purporting to show the damaged qurans			0
a photographer for @entity173 said @entity1 who work inside the airfield told him they obtained the @entity171 there			0
but the @entity127 military said that was unlikely			0
" when it became known that it was religious materials that were brought to the incinerator , the materials were secured by the military authorities in consultation with the local @entity1 religious authorities , so it would be highly unlikely that the demonstrators would have any of the material from this incident , " said col. @entity178 , a spokesman for the @entity24 - led force			1
the @entity127 @entity192 in @entity0 warned on its @entity193 feed that protests were possible throughout @entity1 in the coming days and noted , " past demonstrations in @entity1 have escalated into violent attacks on @entity198 targets of opportunity			0
" last year , when controversial @entity201 pastor @entity200 presided over what he called a trial of the @entity79 and burned a copy , @entity1 took to the streets by the thousands			2
in the northern @entity1 city of @entity209 , demonstrators stormed a @entity211 office and killed 12 people			0
in @entity214 , three people were killed in one demonstration , and nine in another when police and stone - throwing demonstrators clashed			0
@entity127 officials vociferously condemned the pastor 's act			0
" it was intolerant and it was extremely disrespectful and again , we condemn it in the strongest manner possible , " said gen. @entity222 , who headed the @entity127 - led international forces in @entity1 at the time			1
in 2010 , @entity1 protested outside the @entity230 in response to an alleged @entity79 burning inside the base			2
but coalition forces said the suspected burning was a routine burn - pit session in which military documents are destroyed			2
@entity2 's @entity238 and @entity239 in @entity240 , @entity241 in @entity0 and @entity242 and @entity243 in @entity244 contributed to this report .			0
