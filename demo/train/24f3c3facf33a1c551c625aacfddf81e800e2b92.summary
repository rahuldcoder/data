-- " no turtle , no pay , " says the boatman as we arrive at the @entity6 jetty , where visitors are embarking on tours of the lagoon in search of loggerhead turtles			1
@entity6 lies on @entity13 's @entity12 , an almost - tropical maze of river channels , pools and reed beds that once doubled for east @entity18 in the 1951 film " @entity20 , " starring @entity21 and @entity22			1
its beautiful stretches of unspoiled sand are as much a draw for tourists as , for the past 100,000 years , they have been for turtles			2
that both tourists and turtles can still enjoy those beaches today is largely thanks the efforts of one remarkable woman : june @entity33			1
royal backing in the mid- 1980s , plans were drawn up for an 1,800 - bed hotel that would have wiped out the turtles			1
but the developers had n't reckoned on @entity39			0
the @entity41 ballet dancer , painter and singer fell in love with @entity6 during a sailing trip in 1975 and moved into a simple wooden hut here eight years later to live among fisherman , who nicknamed her " @entity49			1
" she also fell in love with the loggerheads , launching a campaign to save the beach that won global support -- including the backing of prince @entity55 , the husband of @entity57 's @entity56 and then president of the @entity59			2
the campaign led to the cancellation of the hotel project and what @entity33 praises as an " intelligent and courageous " decision by the @entity13 government to make @entity6 a specially protected area			1
" i began it alone , but i did n't do it alone , " she tells me			0
now 90 , @entity33 no longer lives on the beach , but in nearby @entity71 , with an extended family of cats and dogs			1
she continues to campaign on behalf of the beach and its inhabitants through the @entity77			0
" the battle has not been won , " she says			0
propeller threat today , @entity6 's loggerheads are threatened by their own popularity			2
more than 600 motor boats now ply the river , ferrying visitors hoping to glimpse them or to view @entity86 , a ruined city built 2,500 years ago by the @entity87 , who also built rock tombs in the cliffs overhead			0
but unless the boats are fitted with propeller guards -- those that are carry the foundation 's logo -- the turtles are at risk of injury			1
cafe owners often toss leftovers into the water to attract them , but the food scraps can do more harm than good , making the turtles ill or deterring them from heading out to sea where they 're at less risk of injury from boats or from hypothermia in winter			2
conservationists want to see turtle feeding banned before this year 's season starts			2
" the @entity12 is not a zoo , " says @entity33 , who is also campaigning against the construction of a giant metal turtle sculpture within a protected nesting area			1
a visit to the @entity117 , where injured turtles are cared for , is enough to convince most visitors			0
those hoping for a glimpse of the amphibians in the water are unlikely to be disappointed			0
luring loggerheads turtles are easy enough to spot if you come to @entity6 -- or other protected turtle beaches such as @entity128 or @entity129 , on the surrounding coast -- in early summer			0
about 300 females still bury their eggs in the sand here in may			0
the female hatchlings that scramble into the @entity138 around 80 days later spend 20 years at sea before returning to @entity6 as mature adults , each up to a meter in length and weighing 135 kilograms , to lay their own eggs			0
the turtles have become a nice little earner for @entity146 , a fact celebrated in the town 's center by a life - size sculpture of a loggerhead			1
among those benefiting are the boatmen			0
it takes about 45 minutes to chug down to @entity6 from @entity146 aboard one of the boats operated by the @entity157 and costs 10 @entity13 lire ( $ 4.50 )			1
at the @entity6 jetty , where boatmen offer turtle spotting trips for an extra five lire , we putter over to where a couple of local fishermen are casting lines baited with crabs , hoping to lure a loggerhead			1
the crabs have vivid red and turquoise claws and are a @entity146 delicacy			2
loggerheads like them too , and after 10 minutes we ( and five other boatloads of sightseers ) are rewarded by a glimpse of a massive , big - eyed turtle taking the bait in its beak			0
smartphones flash , and everyone goes home happy -- especially the boatman , who pockets a 100 lire bonus .			0

@entity13 's @entity12 was used as the *backdrop* for the 1951 film " @entity20 "
@entity33 , who came to @entity146 in the 1970s , was *instrumental* in blocking plans to build a hotel *complex*
@entity33 , known as @entity49 among locals , has dedicated her life to saving the local loggerhead turtles
