@entity0 -- with " birthers " mostly silent , " deathers " are now pushing a new conspiracy theory			0
the release of president @entity7 's birth certificate last week apparently tamped down -- to a large degree -- skeptics who questioned whether he could legally serve as president because they said he was n't a natural - born citizen			1
now , a surprisingly diverse crop of people are questioning whether @entity15 is actually dead			1
some media outlets and bloggers are calling them " deathers			0
" their claims follow a wide range : some believe that the world 's most - wanted terrorist was not the man killed sunday , others think @entity15 is dead but was killed many years ago , and still others believe that the september 11 mastermind is alive -- and secretly being interrogated			1
one @entity30 host is not going quite that far			2
judge @entity32 at one point declared that " @entity15 is dead , " but he later seemed unconvinced			1
@entity32 also questioned the president 's authority to kill him			0
@entity32 began his monday show by saying @entity15 was " killed on the illegal whim of the president			1
" moments later , he added , " @entity15 is dead			1
and the president seems to think he has the right to kill whomever he wants so long as the person is perceived as a monster and the public supports it			0
" and yet the judge also questioned whether officials are " telling us the truth or pulling a fast one to save @entity7 's lousy presidency			1
" later in the broadcast , @entity32 asked a guest , " do you believe he 's dead , or do you want some more evidence : a photograph , a testimony of an eyewitness ? something other than the words of a president whose words we have doubted before ? " others who are questioning @entity15 's death include a libertarian talk radio host , a well - known liberal anti-war activist and some everyday @entity68 students			1
what their claims all have in common -- much like claims that the president was born outside the @entity73 , instead of in @entity74 -- is that they go against the agreed - upon facts			0
poll : 3 % now think @entity7 born abroad @entity7 's decision not to release the photos of @entity15 's death seems to be stoking " deather " fires			1
@entity80 is a @entity82 - based talk radio host who also runs various websites and whose @entity86 channel claims more than 24 million views			1
he is sometimes called a right - wing conspiracy theorist			0
after the president 's announcement of @entity15 's death , @entity80 told his listeners in one broadcast , " my friends , this is a complete and total hoax			1
" " where is the body ? " @entity80 asked in another show			0
" my @entity99 sources nine years ago , on record , confirmed that he had been killed and was frozen on ice			0
" opinion : a no - win decision on releasing photos @entity106 , who is certainly not an ideological ally of @entity80 ' , appears to agree with him on @entity15 's death			1
@entity108 became famous for protesting president @entity111 's @entity110 policy -- even camping out at the @entity99 and the president 's @entity113 , @entity82 , ranch -- after her son was killed in the war			0
shortly after the president 's @entity15 announcement , @entity108 planted seeds of doubt on her @entity122 page and blog			2
" it 's not that i do n't believe @entity7 about @entity15 because he 's @entity7 , i do n't believe him because he is just one in along line of butt - naked emperors , " @entity108 wrote			1
" the only proof of @entity15 being dead again that we were offered was @entity7 telling us that there was a dna match between the man killed by the @entity132 and @entity15			1
even if it is possible to get @entity130 done so quickly , and the regime did have @entity15 dna lying around a lab somewhere -- where is the empirical proof ? " @entity108 continued			2
meanwhile , a @entity122 page -- named " @entity139 " -- has been created as a sort of message board for theories			0
" this whole story is a distraction from @entity7 's birth certificate bollox , " @entity143 posted			1
" that was all over the news until in the space of 24 hours he had found @entity15 , killed ( but not captured ) him , done dna tests and got the results ( dont that take 3 days ) and dumped his body at sea			2
surely if @entity15 was / is such a bad man they would want the world to see him dead whether the pics are gruesome or not			2
" " @entity15 was taken alive and is being interrogated some where before being executed , " @entity159 posted			2
shortly after the announcement of @entity15 's death , university students in @entity162 , @entity68 , where he was killed , expressed skepticism			2
" that 's propaganda , " one student told @entity1 's @entity168			0
" @entity15 has been killed 10 years ago in @entity170			2
and it 's just a propaganda to finish the war in @entity170			0
" others refused to believe that @entity15 was even in @entity162			2
and others echoed calls for the @entity7 administration to show pictures			1
" if it is true , then why are they not showing his body ? " one student asked			0
would image silence doubters or fan flames ? one expert on conspiracy theories said that such wide , diverse claims have one common element : they often come from the political " fright wing			0
" " your conspiracy theories tend to proliferate on the extreme edges of the political spectrum , " said @entity188 , a @entity1 contributor and author of " wingnuts : how the @entity196 is hijacking @entity73			1
" " unfortunately , you 're going to have people who -- especially in today 's politics and especially with the amplification that the @entity200 provides -- will embrace conspiracy theories on almost anything			2
" and @entity188 said such people often share a common trait			0
" they come up with these ornate explanations , alternate explanations , for how events occur , like @entity208 's assassination , in order to keep their own psychology in place			0
' nineteen guys could not have brought down the twin towers			0
it had to be a government conspiracy , ' they say to themselves			0
otherwise , the world becomes really scary and unpredictable and unstable for them			0
" " while it 's entirely predictable that certain @entity15 conspiracy theories would proliferate in the @entity221 , because of some people who have a creative interest in those rumors ... the fact that such ( @entity15 ) conspiracy theories are anywhere in the @entity73 political spectrum is a little surprising and a lot pathetic , " @entity188 added .			1
