-- soon after i was elected to @entity3 , an issue came to the @entity5 floor to which i had given considerable thought and believed that my conclusions were sound , reasonable and persuasive			1
at the front of the @entity5 chamber , directly in front of the elevated rostrum from which the speaker presides , are two lecterns			0
one is positioned to the right of center , facing @entity17 , and one to the left of center , facing @entity19			0
because i felt that most of my fellow @entity19 would surely share my views , i decided to present my reasoning to the @entity17 , who i had hoped to impress favorably			0
so , in giving my very first congressional speech i stood at the lectern facing the @entity17			0
i was greeted with an audible gasp from both sides of the aisle			0
just as @entity19 must drink their coffee , read their newspapers and slurp their soup in a room off the @entity5 floor , and @entity17 do their reading , drinking and eating in a different room , members of the two parties must speak from different places , using different microphones positioned as an extension of their own side of the partisan divide			2
it surprises me still to hear people express amazement at the hyper - partisan nature of @entity3 and its resulting inability to deal collectively with the nation 's problems			1
in a constitutional system that places most of the federal government 's real power with the peoples ' representatives , that is a serious problem			1
but it 's not an accident			2
it 's a direct result of the systems we 've created to choose those representatives and the way @entity3 itself has been allowed to develop not as a single body of @entity64 but as a pit for rival power - seeking clubs to do battle			1
the leaders of the @entity5 and @entity69 are partisans ; but they need n't be , and in other governments they are n't			0
the committee staffs are partisans ; there 's no need for that , either			0
partisan leaders decide who sits on which committees , transferring enormous power over federal law to partisans who win their positions by pledging to support the party line and plowing hundreds of thousands of dollars into party treasuries ( some of it raised from interest groups that are pleased to help out )			0
but as they say on those late - night infomercials , " wait , there 's more			1
" the problem does n't begin in @entity3			1
it begins with how men and women are elected to @entity3 in the first place			1
to even appear on the november ballot , candidates must navigate through primaries either entirely the province of partisan activists ( closed primaries ) or dominated by them ( so - called cross-over primaries )			1
most states have " sore loser " laws ( supported by the parties ) that then prohibit anybody who ran in a party primary and lost from appearing on the general election ballot			0
if 30,000 supporters secure a primary victory for one candidate , anybody who lost that primary would then be unavailable as an option for the rest of the state 's voters			0
in @entity119 , that is precisely what happened to former governor @entity121			0
except it did n't really happen to @entity121 ; it happened to the people of @entity119 who were denied the chance to choose the person most would have wanted to represent them in the @entity69			1
and it happened to sen. @entity128 in @entity129 , who , like @entity130 , was unacceptable to hard - line activists because he actually believed in the kinds of compromise that are necessary to govern a nation of more than 300 million people			1
in most states , candidates for the @entity5 run in districts shaped by partisan leaders for party advantage , regardless of the effect on the rights of the people to be represented by somebody familiar with their concerns and interests			2
that 's how i , a city dweller with no rural experience , found myself representing farmers , ranchers and small - town merchants after a legislature dominated by a different party redrew my district to stretch from the middle of @entity158 to the @entity160 border and then , in an upside - down " l " halfway to @entity162 , all to strengthen their party in other districts			2
even the new infusion of big dollars into political campaigns has a distinctly partisan flavor -- the largest super pacs are not really independent ; they 're being run by long - time party activists			2
we 've created a system that rewards incivility and punishes cooperation			1
is it any wonder that our government is a mess ? @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 all warned us not to create political parties			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : do n't be surprised at the hyper - partisan nature of @entity3
@entity186 : @entity3 ' inability to deal with the nation 's *challenges* can be fixed
he says the problem begins with how people are elected to @entity3 in the first place
@entity186 : we 've created a system that rewards incivility and punishes cooperation
