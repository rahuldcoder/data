-- @entity2 officials for the time being do not have to formally recognize hundreds of same - sex marriages performed last december and earlier this year , after the @entity6 @entity5 on friday granted the state 's request for a delay			1
gov. @entity10 and attorney general @entity11 had told the justices the issue of whether the state 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage is constitutional remains pending in the lower courts			1
having to recognize those same sex marriages before the larger legal questions are fully decided , said the state , would be too disruptive			2
once the constitutional issues are fully resolved --- likely by the @entity5 in the next year or so -- both sides in the debate " will know the status of the interim marriages			0
until then , requiring [ the state ] to recognize plaintiffs ' marriages and provide marital benefits is premature and unwarranted , " said the appeal			0
in a one - paragraph order , the high court agreed			0
but that temporary action does not signal what the justices will ultimately think about the larger constitutional issues raised by gay and lesbian couples seeking a right to wed. a federal appeals court late last month affirmed @entity2 's voter - approved @entity42 violated the equal protection rights of same - sex couples			1
the law currently defines marriage only between one man and one woman			0
a group of plaintiffs then asked that court to order the state to recognize those marriage licenses already issued in late december and january			0
the judges did so , prompting the state 's current stay request to the @entity5 about 1,300 same - sex couples obtained marriage licenses in the 17 days after a federal judge ruled on december 20 that @entity2 's ban was unconstitutional			1
those marriages were stopped after a separate , temporary stay was put in place in january by the @entity5			2
that was the issue in the current litigation			0
the case is @entity67 ( @entity68 )			0
same - sex marriages also were the subject of a ruling in @entity72 on friday			1
county clerks in the @entity75 area have been ordered by the state 's highest court to cease issuing same - sex marriage licenses , until the issue is fully decided			1
the state attorney general had asked for the injunction , saying he plans to defend @entity72 's voter - approved measure defining marriages as only between one man and one woman			2
@entity85 had argued allowing those marriages to go through while the issue is still being debated in the courts would be " legal chaos			0
" after local judges in @entity72 in recent weeks week also ruled the state 's ban to be unconstitutional , several local clerks -- in @entity75 , @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 -- said they had to issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples who requested them			1
but the state high court 's action puts all that on hold for the time being			0
the same federal appeals court that acted in the @entity2 case on friday also tossed out @entity108 's ban			2
both states plan to ask the @entity6 @entity5 to have the final say			1
