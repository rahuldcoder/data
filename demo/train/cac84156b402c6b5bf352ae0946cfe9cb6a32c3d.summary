-- of the 14 " bachelors " and five " bachelorettes " who 've handed out roses to prospective life partners on @entity8 's hit reality show , only four couples are still together and only two have actually gotten married			1
so how does a reality dating show with a 9.5 percent success rate reel in about 8 million viewers week after week ? " it 's the fairytale aspect , " said @entity13 , the entertainment editor at @entity14 , a site covering pop culture and relationships			1
" what man or woman would n't want all these guys vying for our love ? ... it speaks to the part of us that wants to be the bad girl or the bad boy			2
the part of us that wants what is n't good for us			2
" it 's definitely about the fairytale for viewer @entity31 , 55 , who says the show " is like a fantasy			1
" @entity31 said he does n't mind being heckled by his friends for watching the show , which he first came across last season while flipping through channels			2
he said it gives him hope that true love is out there somewhere			2
" it has all the ingredients , " he added			0
" beautiful places , beautiful people			0
... i remember when [ @entity46 and @entity47 ] were on a date in @entity49			0
that seemed like the right place to fall in love			0
" however odd it may seem , some folks believe the show 's failed couplings have been a key ingredient in the show 's continued success			1
according to @entity13 , " we just love it because we feel so much better about our own lives			0
" " it 's been a tough few years -- a lot of people have lost their jobs and their money			1
we all wish we could fall in love in @entity68 and @entity69 and @entity70 , but if we ca n't , why not watch it [ on tv ]			0
" @entity73 , who has recapped " @entity74 " and " @entity75 " since their infancy on his spoiler site @entity79 , agrees			0
" it 's never really been about the ending , " he said			1
" people are more just invested in the dates and the journey and cattiness in the house -- that 's what people tune in for			1
" and @entity8 is well - aware of that , which is why not all of @entity95 's 25 hand - picked suitors this season appear to be a perfect match for this single girl			1
in order to produce such a show , @entity8 casts characters they know will deliver , @entity73 added			1
" they 're not actually looking for the 25 best matches for @entity95			0
... they know what they 're doing -- they 're producing great dramatic tv			1
" @entity106 is one of thousands of viewers who turns to @entity109 tuesday through sunday to fill her " @entity75 " void			1
@entity106 , who started watching the reality series last season when contestant @entity47 was sent home for allegedly having a relationship with one of the show 's producers , says she watches " @entity75 " not as a dating show but as a comedy			2
" i laugh at it all night long because i ca n't believe the things people say and the things they do , " @entity106 said			0
@entity73 adds that it 's important not to confuse the character @entity8 wants you to see with the real person			1
" anybody that says they want to date somebody from the show			0
... you only want to date what you saw on tv , " he says			0
" i 'd hook up with @entity95 , but i do n't know her			0
i do n't know anything about @entity95 other than what the show presents to me			0
and the infatuation with past contestants does n't end with the final rose ceremony			0
either they 're jumping to " @entity144 " as @entity145 and @entity46 did , covering tabloid magazines and blogs or appearing in @entity8 's " bachelor " spin - off -- " @entity150 " -- to air in august			1
" it 's a great way to get your 15 minutes , " @entity13 says .			2

only two of the 14 " bachelors " and five " bachelorettes " are married
shows have a 9.5 percent success rate , yet reels in about 8 million viewers each week
@entity8 's " bachelor " spin - off -- " @entity150 " -- will air in august
