this time there was no escape for @entity3 at the @entity4			1
the 14 - time grand slam winner rallied to beat unheralded qualifier @entity6 in five sets in the second round but he could n't come back against a better opponent , @entity10 , in the quarterfinals tuesday			1
@entity10 crushed @entity3 6 - 2 6 - 0 7 - 6 ( 5 ) thanks to a fine display of power tennis to end a 17 - match losing streak against the @entity15			1
one of those losses came in the 2010 @entity18 final			0
earlier tuesday , @entity19 set up a semifinal duel with fellow @entity22 @entity21 when she eased past @entity23 6 - 3 6 - 2 and 10th - seed @entity21 upset third - seed @entity24 6 - 4 6 - 0			1
while @entity10 barely missed on @entity25 , @entity3 called his own display " very bad " and said he helped @entity10 by lacking in his trademark intensity			1
" the third was the right set , the right game that i have to play , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" but is obvious that before i did n't play with the right confidence , with the right intensity , losing court , playing very short			0
i make him play very easy			0
" so you can not expect to win matches in quarterfinals of a grand slam helping the opponent to play well			1
" contributing to his fluctuating performances in @entity43 were a lack of match practice , added @entity3			2
entering the @entity4 , he 'd only played eight tour - level matches since the middle of july because of a wrist injury , then appendicitis , in another long layoff			1
besides stuttering against @entity6 -- when @entity3 was ill -- the third seed struggled at times in the third round against @entity53			1
he turned it around against @entity55 in the fourth round			0
" when you are coming back from injuries you lose more easier the feeling than you do when you are on rhythm , when you are with no injuries , when you are confident in yourself that you played a lot of matches , " @entity3 said			2
" and that 's the thing that happened , no ? " when i was playing well , i played well			0
but at the same time , against @entity53 i played well two sets , played bad the third			2
against @entity55 , was probably the only match i played regular			0
played the right level during almost all the time			2
" the rest of the matches have been lot of up and down			0
" @entity10 , however , did what he had to , hitting 46 winners and making only 21 unforced errors			2
the tennis tour has seen a handful of retired grand slam winners return as coaches and @entity10 attempted to lure eight - time grand slam champion @entity78 -- @entity80 's former coach -- last year			1
but @entity78 turned down the chance to work with his countryman because he was , according to @entity10 , too busy			2
@entity10 instead opted for the 28 - year - old @entity83 , @entity80 's former co-coach			1
@entity78 and @entity83 were by @entity80 's side when he opened his grand slam account at the @entity86 before the @entity87 became the first @entity89 man in almost 80 years to win @entity18 in 2013			1
@entity10 indeed admitted that @entity83 helped him with his tactics against @entity3 , and the effects were immediate			1
" he changed a lot of things , " said @entity10 , who next faces @entity80			2
" he changed a lot of positive things			0
and the best is i 'm really able to execute them really , really quickly			0
that 's how it should be			0
" but ... it 's not only about sitting on the table and talking about the tactics , it 's also about you have to know what to do with that			0
if you have a plan it 's a nice thing , but if you never tried it before or never practiced before , i mean , that 's useless			0
" the 29 - year - old blasted past @entity3 in an hour in the first two sets			1
when @entity3 elevated his game in the third set , @entity10 did n't buckle even after he missed two match points on the @entity3 serve at 6 - 5			1
he stormed to a 5 - 1 lead in the tiebreak , a deficit that @entity3 was n't able to overcome			1
@entity10 saved all four break points he faced and pummeled @entity3 's second serve , winning 71 % of those points			1
" today i have the only time i can to enjoy the victory , " said @entity10			1
" when i wake up tomorrow morning just all the focus goes for the next opponent and my next match			0
" @entity80 ended the run of 19 - year - old @entity128 @entity127 , dampening the spirits of most of those on @entity25 who showed up for the night match			2
@entity80 won 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 5 ) 6 - 3 , the turning point coming in the second - set tiebreak			2
@entity134 -- the first teenager on the men 's tour to make multiple grand slam quarterfinals since @entity138 -- led 4 - 3 with a mini-break but paid the price for two short approach shots , both punished by perfect @entity80 lobs			1
" he was way too good for me , " @entity134 said			0
the other semifinal pairing will be determined wednesday			0
@entity144 , trying for a fifth @entity4 crown , meets big - serving @entity147 @entity146 , and defending champion @entity148 confronts @entity150 finalist @entity149			1
no problem for @entity19 @entity19 needed three sets to battle past @entity23 at last year 's @entity154 , but tuesday was easier for the five - time grand slam winner			1
@entity23 , meanwhile , drowned in unforced errors , making 30 and chipping in only 13 winners			0
" if i do n't have enough time i probably go for riskier shots and that 's why i would miss a few more , " @entity23 told reporters			2
" that 's why i think i made a few too many unforced errors			0
just feeling under pressure , feeling i had to go for something			0
" @entity19 has turned around her tournament since saving two match points in the second round against qualifier @entity169			2
her dad @entity171 -- who no longer travels with @entity19 -- has n't been shy to give her advice			2
" when you 're down and out like i was in the second match , it 's like , i do n't want to face that phone call with my father too many times during a tournament , " said @entity19 , who last won a major outside @entity154 seven years ago			1
" it 's like , ' i better get my stuff together			0
' " he told me that i was working much harder than i had to			0
if i was maybe a little bit smarter , did a few things maybe a little bit differently , maybe it could have been easier			0
" @entity21 may not be a household name but the left - hander has now reached consecutive grand slam semifinals			1
she handled the occasion better than @entity24 , who lost last year 's @entity154 final to @entity19 in three dramatic sets			1
" i practiced very well in the morning , but maybe i was a little bit too stressed before i started the match , " @entity24 told reporters			0
" was n't my good day			0
i had a bad day			0
" in wednesday 's two other quarterfinals , top - seed @entity196 faces 2014 finalist @entity199 and @entity200 battles @entity201 in an all - american contest .			0
