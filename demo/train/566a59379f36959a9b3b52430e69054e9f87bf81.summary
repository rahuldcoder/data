-- " @entity3 , " @entity1 's new singing competition , has n't exactly risen to the top			1
the series made its debut on sunday with @entity7 as the host and @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as the celebrity experts			1
to set itself apart from the numerous other singing competitions , " @entity3 " hangs its hat on its " revolutionary " voting method : instead of waiting until after the show is over or leaning heavily on the outlook of the judges , " @entity3 's " viewers can vote for contestants in real time through an app. if a contender gets a 70 % approval ( and the celebrity experts each have 7 % of the vote ) , they 're cleared to stick around			1
during sunday 's two - hour premiere , the format seemed to work well enough , except for those who had the misfortune of living on the @entity33 and thus were only able to vote for contestants that did n't get enough votes from the @entity36 to move on			0
the real glitch , according to critics , was the lackluster talent all around -- the celebrity experts lacked chemistry and the hopeful winners were n't that impressive			0
@entity43 found it to be " generic , inept and occasionally offensive , " not to mention " the definition of trainwreck television			0
" @entity47 called it " a joyless experiment in reality innovation " that 's saddled with a trio of celebrity experts who show " little to no real enthusiasm for the program " and a contestant lineup that shows little " promise for giving ' @entity3 ' a coveted slot on your sunday night dvr			2
" @entity64 was more engrossed , falling for the opportunity to " hold a person 's fate in the music industry in my very hands ( and ) ... also potentially get my @entity61 profile picture that i have n't changed in three years on a giant televised wall			0
" yet while the voting and interactive aspect worked " shockingly well , " " it 's still a singing show , and that 's where @entity1 should focus , " @entity64 critiqued , " possibly by cutting the live pre-stage interviews and predicting a little more accurately who the at - home audience will respond to well			2
we really just want to see some good singers and have sole control of their fate , as promised			0
" judging from the premiere ratings , @entity1 has room to grow with " @entity3			1
" the competition 's first episode was watched by 5.1 million viewers and achieved a 1.5 rating in the desired adult demo of 18 - 49			0
at the very least , that does make " @entity3 " @entity1 's highest - rated summer debut in two years .			1

new singing competition " @entity3 " debuted sunday on @entity1
it features @entity7 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as judges
some critics have been harsh ; the premiere ratings have room to grow
