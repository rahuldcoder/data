-- @entity2 's $ 104 billion initial public offering comes at a time when the @entity4 is suffering a bout of self - doubt			1
many wonder if @entity4 is falling behind as other countries are catching up fast			1
and yet the @entity2 phenomenon did not occur in a vacuum			1
you might say it could have happened anywhere			0
but it happened in @entity4			1
and there was a reason for that			2
a company created almost on a whim by a handful of college students rocketed to worldwide popularity in under a decade , bringing together some 900 million users and in the process transformed the way people communicate and interact with each other			0
it 's no coincidence that @entity2 , like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , started in the @entity4			1
it 's also no coincidence the car , the airplane , the light bulb and the telephone were invented here			0
the fact that @entity4 is the birthplace of revolutionary ideas is not an accident			1
here are some of things @entity2 tells us about @entity4 -- not just what is right but what requires careful , urgent nurturing to preserve			1
still brewing that magic potion the modern world knows there is a special , mysterious magic about @entity4			1
despite many serious problems , the main ingredients of that unique recipe remain			0
the @entity4 has created an environment that fosters innovation and promotes creativity			1
there is no better place on earth to break with convention , think differently and blaze one 's own path			0
@entity4 's government may look dysfunctional , its schools leave much to be desired and its financial institutions have the potential to cause disasters , but on the individual level the drive to dream big is as strong as ever			1
and the structure of support for those who have great ideas is still in place			0
how @entity4 shapes the world the days when @entity78 's wish was the world 's command are over			1
but @entity4 's " soft power " lives on			1
the great events of our time have unfolded partly as a result of @entity4 technologies			1
the @entity87 of 2011 was aided by @entity2 and @entity31			2
interpersonal relationships have been recast by social media			0
the industrialized world could hardly function without its @entity29 searches and iphones			0
@entity4 movies , tv shows and music are emulated			2
the drive of immigrant minds @entity4 's not - so - secret formula has always included attracting immigrants and helping them and their children flourish			1
according to a report by the @entity102 , more than 40 % of the 2010 @entity104 companies were founded by immigrants or their children			0
one of @entity2 's founders , @entity107 , was born in @entity108			1
@entity29 's co-founder , @entity109 , came from @entity110			0
@entity112 's ancestors , as well as those of @entity2 co-founder @entity114 , were @entity115 immigrants			1
as long as @entity4 continues to attract and welcome people with intelligence and entrepreneurial spirit , the country will pulsate with creative force			2
designed in @entity4 , made in @entity121 @entity4 may be rolling out one great idea after another , but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions			2
the @entity129 alone has created 700,000 manufacturing jobs in @entity121			0
while @entity4 students are falling behind in international tests , the @entity4 still has one of the best higher education systems in the world			2
we need to make sure our students not only attend college , but study the areas that will be critical to the future : science , technology , engineering and math. maybe then they will find the ways that will allow @entity4 ideas to fuel employment in the country			2
government policies matter @entity2 is successful because bright minds created it , venture capitalists supported it and consumers embraced it			1
but that 's not the whole story			0
@entity2 and other similar high - profile companies would not have made it without the right government decisions , ones that made the @entity158 possible or lowered the price of the microchips			1
while government funding of key industries is crucial , so is the decision to get out of the way at the right moment			0
@entity4 is one of the world 's best places to do business since government does not interfere much with the private sector			1
@entity121 is trying desperately to become a science and technology competitor to @entity4 , but it drove @entity29 out of the country and its heavy - handed tactics have led to technology that mostly copies other countries ' ideas			2
it 's not always about money in the @entity4 , people can make monumental fortunes when they have good ideas			1
but many of the most influential entrepreneurs are driven more by a sense of mission than materialistic pursuits			0
@entity112 could have sold out years ago and lived a life of luxury			0
@entity191 seemed unconcerned with worldly comforts			0
the real driver for these innovators is a wish to create and build			0
those people whose only goal is to make millions sometimes live less fulfilling lives and occasionally cause serious trouble for the economy			0
getting rich is fine , but it 's good for society and the world when individuals work to build more than just a fortune			0
young technology entrepreneurs can follow the examples of the giants of their field			0
as a society , @entity4 should highlight the need to create and build , not just accumulate			2
so , hurrah for @entity2			2
hurrah to those who have transformed the world and our lives			0
and congratulations to @entity4 for creating a place where people 's ideas can become reality			1
now learn from what you did right , @entity4			2
and remember , others countries are also learning from @entity4 's success			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0
