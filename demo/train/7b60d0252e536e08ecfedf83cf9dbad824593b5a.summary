-- the worst measles outbreak in 20 years continues to grow			1
most recently , there was a new case in @entity4 , where there are already 377 cases			0
so far this year , measles has infected 593 people in 21 states			1
as a physician who treats children with compromised immune systems and as a mother of 2 - year - old twins -- too young to be fully vaccinated , i am deeply concerned			1
a few months ago , a 4 - year - old girl came to my clinic with frequent cold symptoms and infections			1
one way to see if her immune system functioned properly was to check her response to childhood vaccines			0
but because the girl 's mother had decided against vaccinating her , i could not perform the vaccine blood test			0
my hands were tied behind my back ; i had no way of knowing if there was a deficiency in her immune system			0
and if she did have a deficiency , she had no protection from the potentially deadly diseases the vaccines are designed to inoculate			0
as it turned out , she did n't have a life - threatening infection -- this time			0
her parents and i breathed a sigh of relief			1
we ca n't know for sure that the anti-vaccine movement , led by uninformed celebrities and discredited research , is the reason we are having such a terrible measles outbreak in the @entity49			1
but certainly it 's not helping our children			1
before measles vaccinations were available , every year in the @entity49 , approximately 500,000 people were infected with measles and 500 died			1
that number fell to around 60 infections annually after vaccinations were introduced in 1994			0
the @entity58 , implemented in 1994 , helped lead to the eradication of measles by the year 2000			1
the @entity60 estimates that in the last 20 years , vaccinations prevented 322 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths , while saving $ 295 billion			1
now , we can add measles to the list of illnesses that are crawling back out of the dustbin of history			1
cases of measles have been on the rise since 2010 , and globally , 14 people die from measles every hour			1
the @entity60 reports the majority of those who have contracted measles were not vaccinated			2
some of the outbreaks have been from unvaccinated @entity49 citizens getting measles abroad and bringing it back to those not vaccinated in the @entity49			1
the trend of not receiving vaccinations has been fueled by many , including @entity80			0
the son of the former co-host of " @entity83 " was diagnosed with autism in 2007			0
since then she has been fervently critical of vaccination , claiming vaccines such as those for measles , mumps and rubella cause autism			1
she founded an organization for the cause , wrote books on the topic and made countless appearances -- all the while arguing , absent any scientific data , that vaccines cause autism			0
@entity80 's views have been influential in fanning parents ' fears of vaccinating their children			1
she backtracked her stance on vaccines in an op - ed she wrote in april 2014 , claiming she is not " anti-vaccine , " but the damage has been done			2
another harmful influence was former @entity109 surgeon and researcher @entity108			0
in 1998 , he presented a highly publicized @entity112 report connecting autism and vaccines			0
later , the study was discredited by many sources			0
in 2010 , the @entity109 @entity116 declared his paper linking vaccine and autism was not only based on bad science , but also a deliberate fraud			2
for his unethical behavior he lost his medical license			0
but his fraudulent work has contributed to a decrease in vaccinations and increase in measles			2
the only credible association between autism and vaccine is age			0
when a child is diagnosed with a developmental delay such as autism , parents naturally search for a cause and look to recent events in the child 's life			1
since the age of onset of autism is similar to when children receive vaccinations , some parents falsely connect these two unrelated events			1
@entity148 , in fact , appears to be rising among unvaccinated children as well			2
while parents have a right to be skeptical and well - informed when it comes to their children 's health , they must not make medical decisions based on unfounded diatribes from a celebrity or fraudulent medical paper			1
5 things you do n't know about measles measles outbreaks in our own backyard should prompt educated discussion with patient families who are not vaccinated			2
we have many credible studies demonstrating that the advantages of vaccination outweigh the disadvantages			2
vaccines reduce the threat of disease or death by a particular pathogen			0
unvaccinated children face challenges when it comes to getting lifesaving care			2
every 911 call , doctor appointment , or emergency room visit , you must alert medical personnel of your child 's vaccination status so he receives distinctive treatment			1
because unvaccinated children can require treatment that is out of the ordinary , medical staff may be less experienced with the procedures required to appropriately treat your unvaccinated child			1
as was the case with the 4 - year - old patient i saw , doctors are not be able to adequately assess a patient 's health if the patient is not vaccinated			0
during pregnancy , women who are not vaccinated can be vulnerable to diseases that may complicate their pregnancy			0
if an unvaccinated pregnant woman contracts rubella , her baby may have congenital rubella syndrome , causing heart defects , developmental delays and deafness			0
choosing to not vaccinate your child not only puts your own child at risk , but it also puts others at risk if their child is n't protected			1
some people can not be vaccinated because of other medical conditions , such as cancer			0
these people rely on the general public being vaccinated so their risk of exposure is reduced			0
according to @entity60 statistics comparing pre-vaccine era deaths to now , there has been a 99 % decrease in measles			2
i know i will continue to give my own children vaccinations to protect their life and health			2
i urge everyone to do the same for the sake of all children .			0

the @entity49 is experiencing the worst measles outbreak in 20 years
@entity243 : the anti-vaccine movement can be *blamed* for *scaring* parents
she says *widespread* vaccination was responsible for eradicating measles years ago
@entity243 : choosing to not vaccinate your child is bad for your child and other children
