@entity2 @entity0 seized at the 2011 raid in which @entity4 was killed outlined plans to unleash terror attacks in the @entity8 heartland -- with hopes of pressuring " 300 million @entity8 " to demand an end to what @entity11 called the " unjust wars " against the @entity14 world			1
" striking @entity8 at home is of the highest and top importance and is the main way to reach what we want , " one letter said			1
" the impact on @entity8 from a strike inside @entity8 can not be compared with hitting them outside the country			1
" in a @entity28 , @entity2 , courtroom , a federal jury this week was the first to hear the contents of the letter and other documents seized during the @entity4 raid in @entity33			1
the documents were read at the terrorism trial of a man named @entity37 , 28 , who was arrested in 2009 in @entity38 , @entity39 , where he had been living on a student visa			2
they were penned by senior @entity11 operatives , according to prosecutors			1
@entity28 federal prosecutor @entity44 described @entity37 to the jury as a " key member " of a broad scheme to " take innocent lives " during a series of alleged failed attacks at a @entity38 shopping center , a newsroom in @entity53 and the subways of @entity2			1
@entity37 is not mentioned in the @entity11 documents			1
" i had no involvement in the activities mentioned in those documents , " @entity37 told the jury thursday			1
the release of the @entity11 papers coincides with the arrests wednesday of three @entity28 men accused by the federal government of attempting to join @entity65 and of fostering separate plans to kill president @entity67 and shoot law enforcement officers			1
the declassified documents at times read like jihadi training manuals -- detailing operational tactics for terrorist assaults throughout the world while , at the same time , invoking the name of @entity76			2
written in @entity78 , the documents were translated by an @entity80 linguist			2
other letters stress the importance of strikes to not only hurt the @entity8 economy but the nation 's sense of security			1
" one of the most important tasks of the organization is to carry out operations that can directly affect the security and economy of the @entity8 people as a whole , " one document said			1
" therefore , operations inside @entity8 and targeting oil overseas , especially in the countries that export it , will have the strongest and fastest impact on the people and will push them to exert pressure on the politicians			1
" there are references to @entity8 history , particularly the large protests generated by the huge loss of @entity8 soldiers during the @entity110			1
" we must put under direct pressure our enemy 's @entity114 , which includes the @entity116 in the @entity117 , @entity118 , and the @entity119 , and which is used to wage the war against us , " said one letter			2
another stated , " one large operation inside @entity8 affects the security and nerves of 300 million @entity8 , whereas killing one thousand soldiers during eight years or more has a weak effect on their mental strain as a whole			1
" the 1941 attack on the naval base at @entity131 occurred on an island far from the @entity8 mainland , one letter noted			1
" they have inherited the concept of security and the idea that no one would dare to attack them inside their home , " it said of @entity8			1
" their sense of security is very sensitive with regard to military operations inside their country , and for this reason it is easy for the matter to be magnified in their eyes , causing them to become angry , to rebel against their politicians , and to mobilize to stop the reasons behind their loss of security			2
" a document included an oath of loyalty that @entity11 recruits swore to @entity4			1
" i accept your allegiance on behalf of @entity167 , to listen and obey , in hardship and ease , and to follow whomever sheikh @entity167 assigns to be my amir on the jihad for the sake of @entity172 , for the establishment of the religion of @entity172 , and to memorise secrets of the group and to be where i am ordered to , " it said			0
targets for operations included @entity179 and @entity180			0
" we had sent a number of brothers to @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity185 , " one document said			0
" we had confidence in them			0
these were @entity180 ( hitting the gas line or the @entity191 ) and @entity179 ( several targets -- the brother determines what suites him in line with what materials he can get )			0
" the hazards of the terror trade were noted			2
" we have many brothers who had spent a long time with us and who are ready to work anywhere , " one letter said			0
" likewise , many brothers with security problems where the main deterrent is the issue of official documents			2
" @entity209 and new ways to spread fear and carry out attacks were considered			2
" guide the brothers towards new methods like using the simplest things such as household knives , gas tanks , fuel , diesel and others like airplanes , trains and cars as killing tools , " said a document , under the section headed " execution			0
" " try to benefit from the brothers with previous criminal conviction to obtain weapons , " it said			0
the @entity11 papers released in the @entity37 trial were found in the walled and fortified compound in @entity236 , @entity33 , where @entity4 was killed in 2011 by a group of @entity8 forces , including @entity239			1
@entity37 is accused of providing and conspiring to provide material support to @entity11 and conspiracy to use a destructive device in relation to the @entity179 plot			1
he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted			0
prosecutors allege that @entity37 received terrorist training in @entity33 and communicated with @entity11 about the alleged plot using coded email messages under online addresses that appeared to belong to a female			1
the bearded defendant , who is representing himself , took the stand this week			0
he told the jury the charges against him were false and that he concocted the email addresses to play pranks on friends and to meet women online			2
he said his emails were innocent and not coded			0
@entity37 said he was in @entity179 looking for a wife , not planning an attack			0
he told jurors that he has " no extremist or jihadi views " or affiliation with any terrorist network			0
" i do not condone 9/11 , " he said of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity8			1
" the events of 9/11 are not justified in the name of @entity14 ... i have never met @entity167 bin laden			0
" a major operation @entity37 is accused of plotting was to happen on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , prosecutors said			0
the operation involved a bomb on the @entity279			0
the plot originated with a man named @entity282 , who allegedly cooperated with @entity37 and pleaded guilty to terrorism charges			0
@entity282 was the first witness in @entity37 's trial			0
@entity37 's 2009 arrest in @entity39 was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in @entity179			2
he was extradited in january 2013			0
a number of @entity179 intelligence agents -- disguised with makeup and wearing wigs -- testified that they tracked @entity37 in 2009 as he visited a @entity38 mall that was to be attacked			0
another witness was an @entity80 official who was in @entity297 and oversaw the trove of evidence collected in the @entity4 raid			1
the counterterror official , @entity301 , testified that he saw @entity4 's body as it arrived at a military hangar			2
