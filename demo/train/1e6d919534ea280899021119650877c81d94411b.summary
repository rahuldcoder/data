-- most @entity2 states are doing a subpar job in protecting against corruption and assuring accountability , according a study released monday			1
the joint report -- from the @entity9 nonprofit advocacy group , @entity8 and @entity11 investigative news organization -- used data on a host of measures to score all 50 states			1
no state received an a grade , while five got bs and 19 were given cs			1
the majority got grades that would be considered not passing in @entity2 schools , including 18 ds and eight with failing grades			1
" what 's behind the dismal grades ? across the board , state ethics , open records and disclosure laws lack one key feature : teeth , " said an overview of the report written by @entity30 from the @entity11			1
the report assessed 330 " @entity45 " across 14 aspects of government such as ethics enforcement , lobbying disclosure , auditing practices and executive , legislative and judicial accountability			1
the top - ranked state , after an analysis of these measures , was @entity49			1
it got a score of 87 , equivalent to a b +			0
it was followed closely by @entity54			0
the only three other states earned above - average scores of b - or better : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
on the other end of the spectrum was @entity62 , which ranked at the bottom of the report 's rankings when it came to transparency and accountability			1
citing one reason for @entity62 's failing grade , the report claimed " more than 650 government employees accepted gifts from vendors doing business with the state in 2007 and 2008 " despite this being a clear violation of state ethics laws -- adding that the state had n't issued a related penalty since 1999			1
the @entity62 was n't alone in scoring an @entity80 it was joined by @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
the report 's overview notes that low grades in some sparsely populated @entity92 or @entity93 states may be attributable to " libertarian roots , a small - town , neighborly approach and the honest belief that ' everybody knows everybody ' ( that ) has overridden any perceived need for strong protections in law			1
" but overall , the study concludes that many failings are preventable , whether by giving more power to ethics boards , bolstering penalties , increasing openness and transparency , or taking stronger measures to decrease the influence of money in politics			2
this is despite some public steps in recent years aimed ostensibly at fighting corruption			0
" state officials make lofty promises when it comes to ethics in government			2
they tout transparency of legislative processes , accessibility of records and the openness of public meetings			2
but these efforts often fall short of providing any real transparency or legitimate hope of rooting out corruption , " wrote @entity30			0
the report offers a number of examples			0
one is former @entity83 gov. @entity135 , in office for three terms in the 1970s and 1980s , who went to a local dealership and took a car on a " test drive " and ended up keeping it for four years , while the dealership earned state contracts			0
then , the report references a @entity147 legislator who owned five billboards and sponsored a bill to loosen billboard construction regulations , with an ethics commission finding no violations			0
and it also faults a @entity155 ethics commission that has n't issued a penalty in its six years in existence and that does n't make complaints available to the public			0
scandals and a history of political corruption can be prime drivers of effective reforms , according to the report , which points to the positive measures taken in @entity49 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
it also credits widespread improvements in transparency , in which legislation and " some government records are easier to retrieve than ever			0
" but @entity174 of the @entity175 on money in @entity177 says in the report that such information often is n't presented in an easy - to - use , easy - to - understand format			0
@entity30 , in the report 's overview , also claims the study found that " lobbyists find ways " around even retooled laws and that " across the board , enforcement is weak			2
" " when it comes to money , influence and power in state government , interest groups and big - money donors will find ways around just about any limit , " she wrote .			0
