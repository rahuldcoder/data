the investigation into how @entity1 ended up at the bottom of the @entity3 , involves recovering the bodies , accessing the flight data recorders , and meticulously mapping where debris is found to reconstruct its path			1
an @entity9 search and rescue official told @entity10 that he thinks material detected by sonar equipment in the water is from @entity1			0
so what happens next ? priorities the first priority is to recover the bodies and return them to their loved ones , @entity9 authorities say			1
helicopters are lowering divers to bring back bodies and debris from the surface of the water			1
the bodies give clues about what happened on the flight , based on where they 're found and their condition			1
for example , sea water in their lungs would suggest that the people on board may have been conscious when the plane struck the sea			1
there is particular attention to the location of the bodies and various debris			1
@entity44 , a former @entity46 safety inspector and analyst for @entity10 , likens it to " peeling an onion apart and then putting that onion back together from the inside out			0
" investigators map the debris found on the surface of the water			1
then they have to look for other pieces in the next level of sea for more clues , he said			1
" so you might go down 50 feet or so , to see if there 's any floating debris there			1
and you keep going down and mapping it as it goes			0
you see how the drift went and how the pieces of the plane moved			1
" during the investigation of @entity75 , more than 150,000 images of the plane 's wreckage site in the @entity73 were taken			1
it was important to " mosaic them together " to give investigators a comprehensive view of the wreckage site , said @entity81 , who co-led that search after the @entity84 jet crashed in 2009			0
data recorders the key to understanding what happened is likely contained in the aircraft 's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder , commonly known as black boxes			1
if they are recovered , @entity9 authorities will designate which agency should open and download the information			0
the black boxes , which are actually orange , are located in the tail for @entity98			0
the cockpit voice recorder collects audio from the pilots ' microphones and various channels			0
" it picks up other sounds like clicks , things going wrong , thuds , hail			0
you can hear that on the windshield , " said @entity110 , a lawyer and former inspector general of the @entity113 @entity112			0
acoustic experts can comb through the audio to try to determine the meaning of every click and sound			2
the data recorder holds hundreds of pieces of data such as airspeed , altitude , whether the plane 's nose was up or down and which direction it was headed			1
all that data would print out on long sheets , almost like @entity132 , that authorities would use to piece together a timeline of the flight			2
because the @entity1 plane was only six years old , its data recorder is fairly modern and would contain lots of parameters , @entity110 said			1
challenges in the search although the plane is in much shallower waters than where @entity145 is believed to have fallen , search crews face challenges			2
nature certainly is n't helping			0
" the problem that the search team is now facing is the monsoon season , " said @entity148 , oceanographer at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
" this plane could n't have gone down in a worse time of year			2
there 's big winds , choppy waves			0
these shallow seas are known for complicated waves			0
it 's really difficult to work in			0
" this could put search and recovery crews at risk and decrease visibility			0
they 're also working under a deadline as the plane 's pingers , or underwater locator beacons , only last for about 30 days			2
salvage operation salvage operations to lift the wreckage are complicated , but the process has been done before in places deeper than the bottom of the @entity3 , which is about 140 feet ( 43 meters ) down			1
the @entity178 salvaged pieces of @entity180 , which crashed off @entity181 in 1996 , from depths of 115 to 130 feet			2
in 1998 , @entity184 officials lifted pieces of @entity186 from the depths of 180 feet , off the coast of @entity188			2
underwater vehicles , designed for deep water salvage operations , can descend as deep as 20,000 feet			1
they could retrieve smaller items such as the flight data recorder			2
since they can only carry up to 4,000 pounds , larger pieces , such as the fuselage would have to be attached to a cable and pulled to the surface by a crane on a ship			0
this was done for recovering remnants of the fuselage of @entity75 .			0

experts : first priority is to recover bodies and return them to families
location of debris and bodies are carefully *logged* and mapped
data recorders are key pieces of *evidence*
salvage operations have been used for plane crashes that were deeper than @entity3
