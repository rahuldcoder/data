-- @entity1 , long champion of all things biggest , longest and most expensive , will soon have some competition from neighboring @entity5			2
@entity1 's iconic @entity6 , the world 's tallest building , could be stripped of its @entity9 title if @entity5 succeeds in its plans to construct the even larger @entity11 in @entity12 -- a prospect looking more likely as work begins next week , according to @entity15			1
consultants @entity16 have recently announced testing materials to build the 3,280 - feet ( 1 kilometer ) skyscraper ( the @entity6 , by comparison , stands at a meeker 2,716 feet , or 827 meters )			2
the @entity11 , estimated to cost $ 1.23 billion , would have 200 floors and overlook the @entity22			1
building it will require about 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel , according to the @entity26			1
building a structure that tall , particularly on the coast , where saltwater could potentially damage it , is no easy feat. the foundations , which will be 200 feet ( 60 meters ) deep , need to be able to withstand the saltwater of the nearby ocean			1
as a result , @entity16 will test the strength of different concretes			0
wind load is another issue for buildings of this magnitude			0
to counter this challenge , the tower will change shape regularly			0
" because it changes shape every few floors , the wind loads go round the building and wo n't be as extreme as on a really solid block , " @entity45 explained to @entity15			2
@entity52 is a partner at @entity53 , the design architects for the project			0
delivering the concrete to higher floors will also be a challenge			0
possibly , engineers could use similar methods to those employed when building the @entity6 ; 6 million cubic feet of concrete was pushed through a single pump , usually at night when temperatures were low enough to ensure that it would set			1
though ambitious , building the @entity11 should be feasible , according to @entity66 , the director of the council on @entity68			2
" at this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometer , maybe two kilometers			0
any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework , " he told @entity15			0
first dinosaur bones in @entity5 discovered inside the world 's largest mall when the elevators do n't work in the world 's tallest building			1

@entity5 is set to start on @entity11 , *slated* to be the world 's tallest building
the @entity11 will reach 3,280 feet , have 200 floors and cost $ 1.2 billion
it would require 5.7 million square feet of concrete and 80,000 tons of steel
the foundations would be 200 feet ( 60 meters ) deep
