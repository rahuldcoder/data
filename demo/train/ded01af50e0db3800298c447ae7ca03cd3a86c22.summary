-- ok , i confess			2
i traveled to @entity2 carrying with me a number of preconceptions			1
for many years , my work in journalism and a lifelong passion to see the world have allowed me to explore scores of countries , but i had left @entity2 far from the top of my list			1
i did not expect a particularly fascinating place : i had vague images of @entity16 , a giant megalopolis of concrete buildings , of exorbitant prices , with heavy traffic and streams of salarymen in identical outfits filing to work every day			0
i pictured not terribly interesting			1
i could not have been more wrong			2
@entity2 , as it turns out , is a captivating country , a kaleidoscope of ancient traditions swirling alongside modern technology			1
it is a land of creativity , of hip funkiness and conservative beauty , of business efficiency and dizzying fantasy			2
it is a place that can pamper your senses , often in the most unexpected ways			0
how did @entity2 surprise me ? let me count a few of the ways			1
stylish in ways you have never seen yes , sure , there are men in gray suits			0
but the eyes have no time to rest on the boring or mundane			2
the @entity2 are fashion - conscious , and many are dazzlingly creative in their personal appearance			1
a ride in @entity16 's subway or a walk down any major street will bring you face to face with looks that reveal detailed attention to beauty and a person - as - canvas philosophy			2
and it 's not just in @entity16			0
in @entity60 , for example , the ancient capital , one sees the super-hip youngsters but also the chic girls all done up , literally head to tabi - socked toe in traditional kimonos , walking through the old geisha district of @entity67 , as if trying to cut through the fog of time and sneak quietly into another era			1
these are the make - believe geisha , spending a few hours wrapped in the resplendent clothes of the past , meandering the streets alongside real geisha			2
if all i could do is watch the people go by , that alone would be worth another trip to @entity2			1
travel snapshots : @entity2 technology meets tradition -- and fantasy there was a time long ago , before everything was made in @entity84 , when every piece of technology seemed to come from @entity2			1
consider that @entity2 had the superfast bullet train , the @entity88 , almost half a century ago			1
@entity2 is still a technology powerhouse			1
brands like @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 sell their inventions around the world and in @entity2 , where technology and tradition sometimes create their own surreal world			1
the best place to see this is in the @entity16 district of @entity103 , known also as " @entity103			0
" @entity103 is , on the surface , a maze of electronics stores			0
you can buy robots , televisions , video games			0
but there 's much more happening			0
as you walk down the streets , you notice people wearing baffling costumes			0
@entity103 has become home to what the @entity2 call " otaku , " people with passionate interests in areas such as technology , role - playing video games and that singularly @entity2 art form , manga comics			1
the neighborhood is home to countless manga stores and is filled with " costume cafes			0
" you see girls dressed as @entity133 maids and other other fantasy characters			2
this is the world of " cosplay " ( costume play ) , in which people play act characters from the stories they love			0
it 's a blend of future and past , of technology and fantasy			1
in other areas , you see the curious @entity2 affinity for " cuteness " kawaii , worthy of a full separate treatise			1
not just big buildings and highways @entity16 is big , so big it 's hard to comprehend			0
the entire metropolitan area , a 35 million - person megalopolis , is the world 's largest			2
but despite the oceans of humanity , @entity2 architecture includes intimate , warm , exquisite buildings and parks that do n't make you feel like an ant about to be crushed			1
still , the masses of people are something to behold			0
and the place to behold them is the world 's busiest pedestrian crossing , outside @entity16 's @entity173 station , which has deservedly made its way into many films			0
besides the gasp - inducing view of thousands of people pouring in all directions when @entity173 's light changes , it 's astonishing that traffic flows neatly when the light changes again			2
the @entity2 generally follow the rules , and that keeps everything moving			1
look at @entity186 , or any major city , for evidence that the @entity2 have built spectacular high - rises , great highways and a rail network rivaled by few , but they have also created other awe - inspiring structures with a powerful spiritual dimension			1
beyond the urban jungle , there are exquisite gardens and temples			0
about 30 miles from @entity16 , in the old @entity200 capital , @entity201 , stands one of the most breathtaking @entity204 statues i have seen			0
the giant @entity204 of @entity201 moved a traveler of his day , @entity207 , to admonish , " o ye who tread the @entity210 ... be gentle when the ' heathen ' pray , to @entity204 at @entity201 ! " shinto shrines and @entity214 temples grace the landscape throughout @entity2 but nowhere in more moving , soothing and restoring fashion than in @entity60			1
like the rest of the country , @entity60 , the capital of @entity2 for a thousand years , is a city of contrasts			1
with nearly 1.5 million inhabitants , it is a modern metropolis			0
but the world has not seen a city quite like this			0
there are thousands of gabled @entity229 shrines and serene @entity214 temples throughout the area			0
some are right in the middle of town			0
and then there 's the enchanting @entity67 district , with its low - slung wooden buildings and its enigmatic , centuries - old rhythms			2
in @entity67 , geisha still ply their often - misconstrued trade			2
the white - faced geisha , or geiko , as they are called here , are trained in the traditional @entity2 arts of music , dance and tea ceremony			1
their services are provided to entertain usually powerful men in @entity67 's old tea houses , mysterious and alluring behind their delicately latticed door fronts along @entity67 's narrow streets			0
the temples of @entity60 , with their elaborate gardens , languid willows , small lakes and countless red - orange torii gates , came as a soothing , moving surprise , a monument to @entity2 's quest for a unique spiritual beauty			1
but just as you are tempted to think of @entity60 as a remnant of history , of traditional arts and ancient religions , one discovers that @entity60 is also the birthplace of the @entity272 and of cutting - edge novelist @entity273 , as well as home to technology developers and brilliant 21st - century minds			1
affordable ? yes , that too among my preconceived notions of @entity2 , high prices took a crucial place			1
it was one of the reasons i postponed visiting , though i share @entity284 's creed , " there is n't a train i would n't take , no matter where it 's going			0
so expensive , at times , i thought my head would explode			0
as when i saw , for example , a single melon , beautifully positioned in its gift box , selling for $ 150 , alongside boxed grapes , selling for about $ 8 for each grape			0
a taxi from @entity296 into @entity16 can run $ 350			0
you can pay $ 500 for a @entity299 steak , and a cup of coffee can set you back $ 8			0
but it does n't have to			0
@entity2 has efficient , affordable public transportation			1
and never mind the fancy restaurants if you want to stay on a budget			0
a rainbow of beautifully presented , relatively affordable food is available everywhere			0
giant department stores , " @entity310 , " have dazzling basements offering every food you can imagine , along with some you never did , from colorful sushi to sweet unagi ( eel ) to okonomiyaki			0
and the prices are not bankruptcy - inducing			2
the cleanest place in the world in @entity2 , the virtue of cleanliness has spiritual origins			1
the @entity2 place such a value on it that you suddenly discover it affects all aspects of life			1
@entity2 may be the last place on @entity328 where it is common to see women -- and occasionally men -- wearing white gloves			1
it may also be the first place where people regularly wear surgical masks , giving all of us bare - faced ones a better chance of dodging viruses			2
and no review of @entity2 's virtues would be honest without mentioning @entity2 's toilets , a marvel of modern technology and a cause for profound gratitude from travelers			1
this is no place for a disquisition on @entity2 's sanitary technology other than to offer a heartfelt arigato			1
@entity352 and bows all around to a country that prizes aesthetic principles , with countless people happy to help a confounded visitor and quick to oblige with preconception - busting , extraordinary surprises at every turn			2
