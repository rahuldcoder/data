-- training for a race is like riding a roller coaster -- you experience highs and lows , ups and downs , and more peaks and troughs than the @entity10			1
two weeks before i raced at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , last year , i had a bad bike crash			2
i won the race , not on physical prowess , but on grit , willpower , determination and mental strength			1
i hope i showed , through my performance there , that sporting success rests , in part , with having the mental fortitude necessary to overcome our fears , pain and discomfort			1
but how does one develop that strength ? is it innate , or can it be learned ? i believe it is the latter			2
we can all train our brains to be as strong as our bodies			2
it sounds simple , but it 's so easy to forget			2
if we let our head drop , our heart drops with it			2
keep your head up , and your body is capable of amazing feats			2
to plunder the words of @entity47 , " do n't ever forget that you play with your soul as well as your body			0
" follow the @entity50 team on @entity51 or on @entity52 the message is this : all the physical strength in the world wo n't help you if your mind is not prepared			0
this is part of training for a race -- the part that people do n't put in their logbooks , the part that all the monitors , gizmos and gadgets in the world ca n't influence			1
but how do you train your brain to help you achieve your goals ? i do n't profess to have all , or many , of the answers			0
but in the five years that i have been a professional triathlete , i have learned a few techniques that help me keep mind over matter and ensure that i can ride the roller coaster of sporting success : have a mantra and / or a special song to repeat i write my mantra on my water bottle and on my race wristband			1
seeing it gives me a boost and reminds me never to let my head or heart drop			0
if you use a permanent marker , be prepared for the wording to stay there long after the race has ended ( and that you might receive strange looks from colleagues when you return to work with " i am as strong as an ox " tattooed on your arm )			1
i also carry a dog - eared copy of @entity98 's famous poem " if " everywhere i go			1
i believe the lines of this poem encapsulate the qualities necessary to become a successful athlete and a well - rounded person			1
reading it before a race gives me the confidence to pursue my dreams			1
keep a bank of positive mental images these images can be of family and friends , of previous races , of beautiful scenery , or a big greasy burger			1
draw on these images throughout the race , and especially if you feel the " i am tired			1
why did i enter this race ? i must be mad " doubts creeping into your mind			1
deliver these negative thoughts a knockout punch before they have the chance to grow and become the mental monster that derails your entire race			1
practice visualization beforehand in training , when traveling , while sleeping or at work , this is the simple act of closing your eyes ( although i do n't recommend doing this at a work meeting or while on your bike )			0
relax your mind and go through each stage of the race one step at a time -- mentally imagining yourself performing at your peak but also successfully overcoming potential problems			1
before @entity145 has even entered the water , he has already completed the race in his mind			1
you can draw on the visual images ( the finish line ) , the feelings you experience ( energy surges ) or the sounds you hear ( roars of the crowd )			1
that way when you race , you have the peace of mind and confidence that you have already conquered the challenges			1
break the race up into smaller , more manageable segments i always think of the marathon as four 10 kilometer races with a little bit more at the end			2
you might think only about getting to the next aid station , or lamppost or @entity169 and , from there , set another landmark goal			0
stay in the moment and do n't think too far ahead			0
i also try to breathe deeply and rhythmically ; if you calm your breath , you can help calm your mind			0
remember that training is about learning to hurt push your physical limits and overcome them in training sessions , so that when you race you know that you have successfully endured pain and discomfort			1
you will draw confidence and peace of mind from this knowledge			0
get people to support you some people thrive on the support from their family and friends , while others perceive it as added pressure			0
work out what feels right for you , and if necessary , invite friends , family or pets to come and cheer you on			0
have them make banners , wear team t - shirts and generally behave in a way that would get them arrested under normal circumstances			2
mentally recall inspirational people i recall people who have all fought against adversity to complete the @entity207			1
these people prove that anything truly is possible			0
you might want to consider dedicating each mile to a special person in your life			0
that makes the discomfort easier to bear and will help give you a mental and physical boost			1
consider racing for a cause that is bigger than yourself for me , it is to establish a platform on which to spread important messages and be a patron for charitable causes			0
these force me to put the race in perspective and rise to greater heights			2
champions come and go , but to me the real judge of my personal success will be whether i actually do something positive with the opportunities i have been given			0
i really hope that , as four - time world champion , i can be a role model and ambassador for the sport that everyone can be proud of			1
i hope that these tips provide some of that sporting gold dust , and enable you to have the race you have always dreamed of			2
we will all continue to endure the downs and the dark times , but remember that it is overcoming these that makes the success all the more sweeter			0
in the words of the great @entity245 : " success is not achieved by winning all the time			2
real success comes when we rise after we fall			0
some mountains are higher than others			0
some roads steeper than the next			0
there are hardships and setbacks but you can not let them stop you			0
even on the steepest road you must not turn back "			0
you might not always have the perfect day , but with the right mental training hopefully the roller - coaster ride will be one to remember			1
just remember to celebrate with that huge plate of greasy burger ! good luck ! follow @entity264 on @entity51 for updates on her training and races .			0
