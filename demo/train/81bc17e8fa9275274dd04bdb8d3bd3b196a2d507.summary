-- though he 's best known for his comedic work playing @entity4 on " @entity5 " and " @entity4 , " @entity1 is enjoying critical success in dramatic fashion these days			1
on the @entity9 original series " @entity10 , " @entity1 plays @entity12 mayor @entity11 , who is suffering with @entity13 , a degenerative neurological disorder			1
the show is a look inside a backstabbing and corrupt political culture , where @entity1 takes @entity11 into twisted , dark places , yet at the same time , exudes a sadness that makes fans feel a little empathy for the guy			1
the first season was just eight episodes , but it was enough to earn @entity1 a @entity27 for " best actor -- @entity29			1
" the series enters its second season friday , with actors @entity32 , hip - hop artist / actor @entity34 and @entity36 joining the cast			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity1 about the politics surrounding " boss " and how a show like " @entity5 " prepares one for a dramatic role			1
@entity0 : you won a @entity27 for " best actor -- @entity29 " for " @entity10			1
" was that a shock ? @entity1 : well , you know , i thought i had a shot with the @entity48			1
they had a great meeting , where they do that chat thing that they do and asked a bunch of great questions			1
it 's like a press conference			1
they asked questions that were interesting and required some thought to answer , so i thought they were obviously engaged a bit in this project			2
@entity0 : audiences know you in comedic roles , but might not think of you as a dramatic actor			2
@entity1 : right , yeah , well that 's something we were keeping secret all this time [ @entity70 ]			1
pull ' em out when you need ' em. @entity0 : on a general level , what 's in store for " @entity10 " season 2 ? @entity1 : there 's so many twists and turns on plot points that ca n't be revealed , but what i can tell you -- the first half of the season is a series of manifestations of his disease and the decisions he 's making are maybe colored by it			1
a bit more rash than he 's been previously			2
so what we have is an accelerated , rhythmic shift in the energy of the show			2
i think some will find welcome , but also confusing in a weird way			2
it all changes again in the middle of the season , where we shift him back in a more slightly evil way and what his choices are for the next season , if we have one			1
@entity0 : what was great about the first season was how manic he became and how it overtook him			1
@entity1 : what i like about @entity11 is that he 's such a fighter			1
he wo n't let it finish him until it destroys him			2
that 's what i love about him			2
@entity0 : i read that the character is n't based on any current @entity12 politicians			1
@entity1 : no , none of those guys are as cool as @entity11 is			1
that 's all i say			2
@entity0 : are there any aspects of the new season that mirrors what 's happening in current politics ? @entity1 : we really try to avoid it			1
if you take a look at the political world , it 's 3,000 years old of difficulties and egos and aspirations and power grabs and betrayals			2
we just wanted to explore what we think is the whole condition of something that always seems current , which is politics			2
@entity0 : where does he fall in terms of the complexity of characters you 've played ? @entity1 : he 's probably the brightest guy i 've ever played			1
he 's the greatest fighter i 've ever played			1
@entity151 is similar to him , certainly			2
what i love about @entity151 is that he starts out as a hero and ends up as heroically evil in the end			2
so @entity11 might start out where @entity151 is , but @entity11 will fight you for that last ounce of life			2
i love that about that character			1
i wish i was more like him			2
@entity0 : there 's this great balance that the viewer gets of this guy			1
he 's estranged from a lot of people that once meant a great deal to him in his life , and he has this disease that will make him nothing that he planned			2
but at the same time , he can be quite horrible to people			0
how do you balance that in bringing that out ? @entity1 : it 's confusing			1
what 's interesting about @entity11 is that when he 's in a caring moment , it 's real , it 's full , it 's rich			0
you spot the humanity that 's within this monster			0
you start to feel sorry for the monster , which is typical of a great horror - movie villain			0
you discover this humanity in him and you long for it in a weird way			0
but when he cares , he really cares			0
but then it becomes more confusing			0
it 's just a great thing to get to play			0
he 's so disabled by his own choices			0
@entity0 : what most of us know about politicians is through these mediated filters : what we see on tv or the @entity202			0
but this show is interesting because it gives a deeper look into these people that have a lot of responsibility			0
@entity1 : it 's funny , i like the idea that my politicians might be human			1
i also want them to be real			0
i like it when politicians acknowledge " i 'm good at this , i 'm not good at that , you got to help me do that			0
" i 'd love more candor			0
but we 're not going to get it			0
@entity0 : are there things that you learned working on a show like " @entity5 " that that you 're using still on " boss " ? @entity1 : well , comedy 's interesting			1
for a great laugh to happen , you have to believe the situation and believe the character			1
comedy today is really gag - gag - gag , one - two punch			0
with @entity4 we tried at least a page , a page - and - a - half without asking for a laugh			0
that 's a slightly different experience			0
" @entity5 " was a bit like that , but " @entity4 " more			0
what you learn from a drama like " @entity10 " is that there are big choices i make as that character and you have to believe it 's possible			1
i mean , @entity4 ended up jumping up and down on a bed , pretending he was having sex with himself ( @entity70 )			0
this is extraordinary s * * t. but you have to believe this is possible and coming out of a real situation			0
so i end up tearing some guys ear off as the mayor and you believe it			0
because you bought into why he 's there			0
maybe those things are what you learn as a result of knowing what works ... you have to lay the foundation			0
@entity0 : have you been following the current race ? @entity1 : listen , this one was really predictable to what was going to happen , from both sides at this point			1
it has been for a couple years			0
if you 're not doing well in office , then the country 's split			0
they 've been playing that card for awhile now			0
we 're in that cycle			0
i 've been rooting for the conservative side of the equation for awhile now and that 's where i 'm at			0
only because i think it 's time for change this time , a different kind of change			0
the new season of " boss " premieres august 17 on @entity9 .			1

" @entity10 " returns for season 2 on friday
the series won star @entity1 a @entity27
he says this character is the brightest guy he has ever played
