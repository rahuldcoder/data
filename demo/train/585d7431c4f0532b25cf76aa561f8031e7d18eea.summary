-- @entity1 is joining forces with two television shows to make tv a two - way experience for kids			1
using the motion sensor and voice - recognition software in @entity1 's @entity11 system for @entity12 , children will be able to interact with two popular shows for young viewers : " @entity15 " and " @entity16			1
" the idea behind these two new game / tv applications -- " @entity20 " and ' @entity21 ' -- is to have characters in the programs talk to the kids and help them participate in show activities			1
for example , in " @entity20 , " @entity26 will ask viewers how many coconuts are in his box			2
under normal tv viewing , a child could give any answer and @entity26 would say , " that 's right			1
there are 5 coconuts in the box			0
" with the two - way experience , if the child gives a wrong answer , @entity26 would ask him or her to count again and would only continue once the right answer is given			2
@entity41 , executive vice president of content and distribution at @entity43 , envisions the @entity11 as a new way to connect with the " @entity16 " audience as the program enters its 43rd season on television			1
" ( @entity49 ) is a natural and intuitive interface for preschoolers , " he said			0
" you do n't have to teach a child how to use a mouse or how to use one of those complicated controllers that most gaming platforms have			0
" @entity58 said his company has worked hard to layer interactivity into their shows for " @entity62			2
" the shows are from last season , but the experience for the kids will be totally new			1
if the child does n't feel like playing along , the show will continue passively , just as if it was broadcast on tv			1
@entity1 also is discovering people are using @entity11 for more than just gaming			1
usage numbers for @entity74 in the past year show a growing percentage of time spent on nongaming activities , the company said			1
@entity1 feels this partnership with @entity43 and @entity79 was a perfect extension to appeal to those nongamers			1
" people who have been our gamers for a long time are also expanding their entertainment usage of the platform , " said @entity82 , @entity12 director of product marketing for family experiences			0
" what you see with ' @entity62 ' and ' @entity21 ' is that first real concerted effort of how we use interactive entertainment with gaming mechanics			0
" @entity82 said until now many young kids may not realize the tv does n't hear them and might jump when told to jump			1
she hopes when @entity98 throws a ball to a child and the child catches the virtual " ball " and throws it back , it will open up brand new experiences for those kids			2
both @entity58 and @entity82 said this partnership is likely to open doors to new content opportunities for kids and gamers			0
@entity58 said @entity43 learned a lot about what kids will do in front of a television when prompted , which will help them develop new interactive content for the future			0
and @entity82 credited @entity43 with finding a unique way of getting kids to stand in the best spot for the @entity11 to be effective			1
" when you develop things for a 3 - year old , you 've got to be drop - dead simple and really smooth to use , " @entity82 said			0
" they 've actually developed this really clever application of a mirror			0
the mirror is a little character himself , and he 's wanting you to find yourself			0
the little ones are shouting , ' here i am ! ' and they are standing perfectly in the sweet spot for the @entity11			2
" each episode runs about 45 minutes , depending on the interactivity level of the child			0
a hard disc of eight episodes can be bought through retailers ( $ 29.99 ) , but shows can also be downloaded using @entity74 ( $ 4.99 per episode or $ 29.99 for a season pass )			0
there is also bonus historical content for both shows included on the disc and with the season pass			0
