who would you say is more successful : @entity3 nominee @entity2 , or @entity3 nominee @entity4 ? in terms of numbers of memorable -- even legendary -- screen roles , it might be difficult to say			0
and in terms of lasting power , they both have grown in reputation over the years			0
but in terms of most recent earning for the year 2012 - 2013 , the winner is clear : @entity2 , age 39 , earned $ 39 million in pay while @entity4 , age 64 , earned only $ 7 million			1
( one caveat : their earnings are also influenced by the box office success of their films			0
) sure , that 's just one year and those are just two stars			2
but if we look across the board , we ca n't help but come to the same conclusion : there 's an unfair pay disparity in @entity32			1
as we look forward to this year 's @entity3 show on sunday night , it 's worth taking a moment to reflect on the movie industry and what it tells us about ourselves			2
research that my colleagues @entity41 , @entity42 and i conducted shows that whereas young @entity32 actors and actresses make about the same in yearly earnings , that parity quickly evaporates as they age			1
according to our study , for actresses , their pay peaks at age 34 and then drops quickly thereafter			1
for actors , their pay peaks at a much later age -- 51 -- and just as importantly , does not drop after that nearly as severely as it does for actresses			1
we measured leading actors and actresses over many years			1
at age 27 , actresses make an average of $ 3.9 million , compared to $ 2.6 million for actors			1
by the age of 51 , actors make an average of $ 5.3 million , more than five times as much as actresses			1
why is it that age ravages the earnings of actresses compared to actors ? some might blame @entity32 movie industry -- a field that is overwhelmingly male dominated			1
some might argue that female actresses are more likely to take breaks from acting at the potential peak of their careers , as have @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
while there probably is some merit to these explanations , i think we need to look closer to home			0
to borrow from @entity91 , i 've met the enemy , and he is us			0
let 's face it , we 're an appearance - based society and despite social progress on many issues , i do n't see much evidence that our obsession with appearance has faded over time			1
indeed , some have argued that the growth in online communication and social media has only exacerbated the problem			0
some may feel that our obsession with beauty is a problem because it 's superficial , it 's hard to change , or it is n't related to true intrinsic worth ( for example , a job or a mate )			2
yet we know that we value beauty even though it is hard to justify the value we place on it			2
it 's more insidious than that			0
our beauty obsession particularly gets applied to women ( who are more likely to be judged by their appearance than men ) and against older individuals ( people are rated as less physically attractive as they age )			1
we are , therefore , especially biased against older women			1
tell me about it , some of you more mature women may say			0
it 's important to remember that this is n't simply about male biases			0
those exist , but so do female biases			0
both men and women judge others by their appearance , and both genders are more likely to be especially biased against less attractive women and older individuals			1
who 's really to blame here ? is it @entity32 , or those of us who consume @entity32 culture ? there is plenty of blame to go around			1
@entity32 , like @entity150 , both leads and follows society			1
in commenting on this disparity , @entity153 said , in her characteristically satirical way , " there are still great parts in @entity32 for @entity157 over 60			2
" judging by the current list of best actor / actress nominees , including near - octogenarian @entity161 , @entity153 is correct			0
in fact , some might say the @entity165 nominees are on the aged side , with none in their 20s , three in their 30s ( one woman , two men ) , four in their 40s ( two men , two women ) , and three older ( two women , one man )			2
but the earnings do n't follow , and the roles for older females are generally not as available , we found in our study			0
even 83 - year - old @entity180 recognizes the problem , commenting , " roles thin out when ( actresses ) get to a certain age			2
... it 's a crime			0
" the first step toward social change is to recognize the problem			0
we 've got a beauty complex that does us little good and much harm			0
the sooner we own up to that , the sooner we can defeat that enemy within us			0
as we enjoy the glamor of @entity32 at this time of year , all those beautiful people dressed to the nines should remind us : there is a lot more to life than looks			1
let 's confront our own biases that support this culture , and try harder to value the things that really matter .			0

@entity207 : @entity32 actors and actresses make about the same until they age
judge : actresses ' pay peaks at about age 34 whereas actors pay peaks around 51
he says we can blame @entity32 , but it 's also that our society is obsessed with beauty
judge : both genders are biased against less attractive women and older people
