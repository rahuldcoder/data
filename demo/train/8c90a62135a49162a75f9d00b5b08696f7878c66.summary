as she positions herself for a potential presidential run in 2016 , @entity0 sought to shine her spotlight monday on one of her longtime goals : narrowing the gender gap around the world through the use of data			1
the former secretary of state spoke briefly monday at an event with former @entity12 mayor @entity11 to give a progress report on their joint 2012 initiative known as " data2x " -- an effort intended to spark " a gender data revolution " -- which is a partnership of the @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21			1
@entity22 noted that her quest to improve the data about the status of women around the world stemmed from her years as secretary of state when she would try to broach those topics with other world leaders , who would " smile and nod " but often not take the topic seriously			0
" you ca n't understand what the problem is if you do n't have a good grasp of what the facts and figures are , " @entity22 said			0
at the @entity41 , she learned , she said , that she could not rely solely on the moral argument that women 's rights should be considered human rights			1
@entity22 said she wanted to use to data to build a case strong enough " to convince the skeptics , based on hard data and clear - eyed analysis , that creating opportunities for women and girls across the world directly supports everyone 's security and prosperity , and therefore should be an enduring part of our diplomacy and development work			2
" " after all , good decisions in government , in business , in life , are based on evidence rather than ideology or gut feelings or anecdotes , " @entity22 said			0
the former secretary of state did not address other topics in the news monday -- namely last week 's release of a @entity73 report on the @entity75 's use of torture as part of its interrogation practices during the presidency of @entity80			2
( president @entity81 banned the use of those techniques after taking office in 2009 )			0
@entity22 has been closely monitoring progress on gender issues since her years as first lady in the @entity88			2
it was at the @entity90 in @entity91 in 1995 that @entity22 famously declared that " human rights are women 's rights and women 's rights are human rights " -- setting the course for her advocacy as a @entity95 from @entity12 and later as secretary of state			1
she and her daughter , @entity102 , have targeted their efforts through a @entity19 initiative known as the " @entity107 " project			0
at an event in february with her daughter @entity111 and philanthropist @entity112 , @entity22 announced that the @entity19 and the @entity113 were embarking on a global review to track women 's progress across the globe since the 1995 conference			1
