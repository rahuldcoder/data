-- @entity2 plans to launch next week the first of 17 planned flights to study changes in @entity7 ice and collect data that may help scientists better predict the consequences of those changes , officials said thursday			1
@entity13 's @entity12 , viewed from @entity2 's dc - 8 aircraft in 2004 , is one target of the 2009 operation			0
the first flight over the @entity7 is planned to take off october 15 from @entity18 , @entity19 , according to a @entity2 statement and scientists involved in the project			1
the flights are part of " @entity26 , " a six - year plan described as the largest ever airborne survey of ice at @entity30 's poles			2
" we have operated in @entity13 a few times previously ... but these surveys barely scratched the surface , " @entity31 of @entity2 's @entity32 told reporters on a conference call thursday			0
the flights will be conducted by a @entity39 outfitted as a special airborne laboratory with laser mapping instruments , ice - penetrating radar and gravity instruments			2
the flights will be able to gather information that a satellite can not			0
" the problem with satellites is , we ca n't see through the ice sheet with satellites , " said @entity46 , a scientist at @entity48 's @entity47 who also is involved in the project			1
she said the technology carried on the plane will provide researchers a chance to address questions regarding why the ice sheet is changing			1
" we really want to know how much water is under the ice sheet , " she said			1
the technology will allow scientists to detect that water and see how much is present under the ice			1
that information , according to the @entity2 statement , can help predict how changes in the ice sheet will contribute to a potential global rise in sea levels			1
but officials said the flights also will serve as a partial replacement for one satellite : @entity2 's @entity76 , known as @entity77			0
the current @entity77 has been in orbit since 2003 and is nearing the end of its lifetime			0
the next satellite , @entity77 , is scheduled to launch in 2014 at the earliest			2
without the flight measurements , " we would be blind " to changes in the ice sheet , said the mission leader , @entity81 of the @entity82 in @entity83			1
he also was on thursday 's call			0
in the @entity2 statement , @entity88 , cryosphere program manager at @entity2 headquarters , said , " a remarkable change is happening on @entity30 , truly one of the biggest changes in environmental conditions since the end of the ice age			0
it 's not an easy thing to observe , let alone predict what might happen next			0
studies like ' @entity26 ' are key			0
" " @entity103 " refers to the regions of the @entity30 's surface where ice predominates			0
because flights can not cover the entire @entity7 continent , scientists have selected key sites to study that are most prone to change , @entity2 said			2
" sea ice measurements will be collected from the @entity111 , where local warming suggests the ice may be thinning , " the statement said			2
" ice sheet and glacier studies will be flown over the @entity116 and @entity13 , including @entity117 , an area scientists believe could undergo rapid changes			1

first flight over @entity7 scheduled to take off october 15 from @entity18 , @entity19
technology *onboard* will help answer why the ice sheet is changing
data will help predict how changes might contribute to a global rise in sea levels
