@entity0 -- @entity2 has driven his bright red taxi for 20 years			1
born and raised in @entity0 , he calls himself not @entity5 but a " @entity6			1
" the distinction is very important to him			0
" the difference between @entity0 and the mainland is that we grew up in a relatively free environment , " he says			2
relative freedom rings in this metropolis on the southern tip of @entity5			2
there 's freedom of assembly , freedom of the press and rule of law			0
since the handover from @entity22 to @entity5 17 years ago , the people of @entity0 were granted a wide range of civil liberties and a measure of autonomy under the governing principle known as " one country , two systems			1
" but many say that way of life is now under threat as @entity34 affirms its " comprehensive jurisdiction " over @entity0 in a white paper issued by the @entity36			1
many in @entity0 consider the white paper an abrupt missive from @entity34 declaring that they call the shots			1
political muscles @entity42 is a member of @entity0 's @entity43 and organizer of @entity45 -- a movement of pro-democracy activists who have threatened to " occupy " the central business district if their calls are not heard			1
he tells me this is the message from @entity34 : @entity0 is subordinate to the central government			1
" and when the time comes -- if it 's necessary and appropriate -- all the powers previously given , dedicated and authorized to @entity0 , could be taken back , " @entity42 adds			2
@entity5 's political muscle flexing comes at a politically sensitive time for the territory , as scores of @entity6 demand true universal suffrage to elect their leader			1
the @entity62 has said that the election of @entity0 's top leader may be implemented by universal suffrage in 2017			1
but will it happen without @entity34 effectively screening the candidates ? as a hint of what will happen in 2017 , @entity67 , professor and director of the @entity69 , points to how patriotism is emphasized in the white paper			1
" clearly they are saying that ( patriotism ) is the fundamental requirement , " @entity67 says			0
" and we have to be assured whoever is being nominated to run is patriotic , according to our definition , i.e. willing to follow orders			0
" standing ground on july 1st in @entity0 , tens of thousands of protesters -- if not more -- demonstrated for a free and open system to elect their government			2
after the march , more than 500 protesters were arrested at an illegal sit - in -- including @entity42			0
prior to his arrest , the pro-democracy lawmaker told me he was willing to go to jail to expand democracy in @entity0 " because we have to make it absolutely clear to @entity34 that they have to honor their promises given to the @entity0 people			1
" but is civil disobedience the only way forward ? @entity100 is @entity0 - born designer and co-founder of @entity102 , a retail business and lifestyle brand that draws inspiration from local icons from old mailboxes to mooncakes			2
over the years , @entity100 has courted controversy -- and the attention of @entity0 police -- with a few eyebrow - raising designs			2
and yet the rebel designer believes persuasion -- not protest -- should shape the future of @entity0			2
@entity100 addresses @entity42 point blank : " i think you are going to create more enemies than supporters			0
" " at the end of the day , especially in an @entity123 society , i do n't think people react well with aggression			0
it 's soft power , it 's persuasion , that can appeal to them			0
" true freedom like many other business owners in @entity0 , @entity100 believes demonstrations should take a backseat to dialogue with @entity5 to bring about more opportunity			1
" we should integrate with @entity5 , " @entity100 says			0
" kids will be able to build their homes and businesses because what we suffer from is the lack of space in @entity0			0
" " if we can embrace @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , @entity0 will be a great metropolis			0
" but , as @entity42 points out , such opportunity requires both sound infrastructure and sound governance			0
" we need good government , " @entity42 tells me emphatically			0
" and that must be based on a truly democratic government			0
" @entity0 taxi driver @entity154 wants his vote to truly count one day			0
" i definitely want universal suffrage , " he says			1
" so that we can have a leader who is not as corrupt as mainland officials			1
" it 's the aspiration of a people raised on freedom			0
but true universal suffrage anywhere on @entity5 soil is not something @entity34 will easily grant .			1

@entity0 governed by @entity5 under " one country , two systems " model allows the territory more freedoms than the rest of the country
the election of @entity0 's top leader may be by universal suffrage in 2017
but will it happen without @entity34 screening the candidates ?
@entity0 *resident* : " i definitely want universal suffrage so that we can have a leader who is not as corrupt as mainland officials "
