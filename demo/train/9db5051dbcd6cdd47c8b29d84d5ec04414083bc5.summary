-- like so many @entity2 across the country , i was shocked when i heard of the attacks at the @entity5			1
a part of me immediately traveled back to when i was cheering runners myself as a student at @entity9 , the midpoint for the marathon , a time when such dangers as bombings never crossed our minds			1
@entity17 is an indelible part in the personal history and identity of those who have lived or attended school in the city			1
that someone had detonated bombs at an event that symbolized unity in a place known for its rich diversity and as a birthplace of our nation 's freedom was heartbreaking			2
this last week has seen a whirlwind of fighting in a dramatic manhunt , leaving an entire city on lockdown and lives in danger			0
i am heartened to hear stories where the human spirit rose above the ugliness and absolute horror facing the community			0
law enforcement officers and other first responders risked their lives to help others			0
several marathoners ran straight to the hospital to give blood , and doctors rushed to hospitals			0
a restaurant opened its doors and offered free food to its neighbors while they were stuck in a lockdown			0
it is these testaments of unity and heroism that make us stronger			0
@entity65 are coming together and helping each other because , as @entity2 sen. @entity67 of @entity68 said , " when tragedy strikes , we are ... one family			1
we hurt together , we help each other together			0
" we have , sadly , seen less than stellar moments in our nation 's response to these attacks			1
a @entity76 in the @entity77 says he was viciously beaten soon after the @entity5 -- he was mistaken for " @entity79 , " and believes the attack was motivated by the bombings			2
a mother in @entity83 , @entity68 , who was wearing the traditional @entity85 head covering , says she was punched in the shoulder by a man shouting @entity89 slurs while blaming @entity90 for the @entity17 bombings			1
while most leaders and media have been measured in their tone , we have seen some jump to conclusions or incite vitriol against their fellow @entity2 , the most outrageous of which was commentator @entity99 tweeting , " let 's kill them all , " referring to @entity90			1
he later claimed it was sarcasm but then wrote on a social network site : " it 's nice to see all the @entity105 apologists standing up for those who would waste them in a heartbeat			0
" as we learn more about the two brothers who are suspected of these horrific crimes , @entity2 should not let anyone , especially those who seek to instill fear , tear our nation apart			1
emotions and frustrations are running high , and as we grapple to make sense of the tragedy , it is critical for all @entity2 to refrain from scapegoating any group of people or targeting innocent @entity2 based on their racial , religious and ethnic identity			1
as @entity2 , we were all proud of the way most citizens in this tragedy responded			2
bystanders , first responders , marathoners and law enforcement rushed to do what they could			0
these good people came from every faith and background , reflecting the rich diversity that makes our country great			2
we must remember that the same thing that defined our strength on that day should define our strength in response -- a nation that unites people from every faith , culture and background in a common purpose			1
we stand taller , braver and united when we stand together			2
and that is something no criminal should ever be able to take from us			0
