-- this season has been very good to @entity2			1
@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 — not so much			1
this year 's television season is only a few weeks old , but there are already signs about how it 's shaping up in the ratings			1
the news is not good			0
for the first three weeks of the 2012 - 2013 season , according to @entity12 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 are all down by double - digits in the key 18 - 49 demo , which helps sell advertising only @entity2 is up			1
( fortunes for the @entity20 , the netlet co-owned by @entity18 and @entity4 , are still unclear			2
) is network tv dying ? according to @entity23 , director of @entity24 for @entity25 and @entity26 at @entity27 , it 's not that simple			2
" @entity28 is certainly not where it was back in the years of the ' @entity29 , ' " he said			0
but he added that the major networks still have the most money , and can grab the most eyeballs , even if viewers have scrambled their viewing habits			0
it 's not that no one is watching tv — it 's just that they 're watching it across many different platforms , like laptops and tablets or through streaming services like @entity44			2
in this " multichannel universe , narrow - casting is the order of the day , " @entity23 said			0
with so many options , people tend to seek out what 's tailored to their tastes , which helps explain the explosion of cable channels since the 1980s			0
in 2009 , they accounted for more than 40 percent of household viewing , according to @entity56 , while networks made up 25 percent			0
" @entity65 " is one of tv 's biggest shows , dominating its time slot and the cultural conversation — and it 's on @entity64			2
by comparison , @entity23 said , part of the networks ' problem has been a lack of " big new things : " the shows that can pull people back to their couches			1
in 2011 , it was " @entity78 " on @entity2 ; in 2009 , it was @entity3 's " @entity77			1
" " it 's not that this year they said no to the next ' @entity77 ' and chose the wrong thing , " @entity23 said			1
" it may be that the next ' @entity77 ' did n't present itself			0
" of the 20 new shows launched by the five major networks this year , only one of them — " revolution " on @entity2 — has been an overachiever , by debuting big and staying that way			1
season - to - date , its 18 - 49 rating is almost twice @entity2 's average , according to @entity94			1
it may be no coincidence that this year 's success stories are genre shows , like the post-apocalyptic " revolution " and the post-apocalyptic " @entity65 , " or even the @entity20 's " arrow , " about a brooding , hooded superhero			1
the success of " @entity78 , " meanwhile , means viewers remain open to big , splashy reality and competition shows , @entity23 said , even if @entity2 risks overexposing the show			1
the networks still have the benefit of a lot of marketing and production muscle : their shows can be bigger and their ads can be louder			0
some of the buzziest programming however , including @entity3 's nuclear sub thriller " @entity119 " and its country music soap " @entity120 , " is also some of the lowest - rated			2
@entity23 suggested that prestige programming is now better left to cable and the smaller , more passionate audiences who flock there			0
sitcoms are still bustling , even if several high - profile fall launches ( @entity5 's freshman " the @entity130 , " @entity3 's pairing of returning comedies " @entity127 " and " @entity128 " ) have n't broken through			1
it does n't matter , @entity23 said : comedy properties are full of potential — not just in primetime , but in syndication , where they can be replayed at hefty prices for years			0
@entity12 's annual survey of tv commercial prices , released at the end of october and based on pre-season estimates , backs up @entity23 's claim : seven of the 10 costliest shows are comedies , including " @entity77 , " @entity5 's " @entity148 " and @entity4 ' " @entity149			1
" " the first three things on my top 10 list of things to do would be develop half - hour comedies , develop half - hour comedies , develop half - hour comedies , " @entity23 said			0
meanwhile , the networks are in a " holding pattern , " waiting for the next big thing to stop the slide , he said			2
the trick is finding them			0
" the content is everything , " @entity23 said			0
" in the end whether people are going to watch hits on their laptops or five days later on their dvrs or watch it the old way , if you get a big hit like a ' @entity166 ' or a ' csi ' when it was at its peak , then you 're going to be fine			0

this year 's fall tv season has been good to @entity2
@entity5 , @entity3 and @entity4 are struggling in comparison
part of the problem is a lack of " big new things "
one thing that is working for networks are sitcoms
