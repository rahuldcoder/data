-- two journalists covering civil unrest following a fatal shooting in @entity4 , @entity5 , said they were briefly arrested wednesday night inside a @entity6 's in the community			1
@entity8 of the @entity9 and @entity10 of @entity11 said on @entity12 that they were arrested while they were doing work and then released within roughly 45 minutes			1
" this was very unnecessary , " @entity8 said in a telephone interview			1
he said he was never told why he and @entity10 were detained , except that they were " trespassing " by being inside the fast - food restaurant			1
@entity8 recorded a portion of his interaction with an officer inside the @entity6			2
in the video , which was published on the @entity9 's web site , an officer is heard demanding that he " stop videotaping			2
" citizens and professional journalists generally have the right to record police activities			1
afterward , @entity10 wrote in a @entity31 post that a police officer " in full riot gear " " purposefully banged my head against the window on the way out and sarcastically apologized			1
" @entity10 added , " i 'm fine			2
but if this is the way these officers treat a white reporter working on a laptop who moved a little too slowly for their liking , i ca n't imagine how horribly they treat others			2
and if anyone thinks that the militarization of our police force is n't a huge issue in this country , i 've got a story to tell you			1
" @entity8 emphasized that he did not want his arrest to overshadow the ongoing protests in @entity4 or the treatment of the protesters			1
" i want this to be about the community , " he said			2
" but this arrest is in some ways an anecdote of what 's going on here			2
" the arrests came amid an already - tense situation between journalists and the authorities in @entity4 , the site of last saturday 's police shooting of an unarmed 18 - year - old , @entity70			1
there have been several reports of reporters and the camera crews being told to leave protest areas , but no reported arrests until wednesday			0
the @entity4 police chief , @entity77 , told @entity0 he did not know who the arresting officers were			1
" we had a lot of different agencies out there , " @entity77 said			0
at 11 p.m. cdt , @entity77 said 18 people had been taken into custody on wednesday , including the two reporters			0
elsewhere in the area on wednesday evening , a number of reporters said they were doused with tear gas when authorities tried to disperse crowds			0
@entity93 , a correspondent for @entity94 who previously worked for @entity0 , said his crew was in a place " we believed to be safe " when people started running toward them			0
" rubber bullets were fired on us , and then a canister , " he said			0
" we had to retreat into the neighborhood			0
" in a statement about the " worsening situation in @entity4 , " @entity5 gov. @entity103 urged law enforcement agencies " to keep the peace and respect the rights of residents and the press during this difficult time			1
" officials at both the @entity9 and the @entity11 issued statements that assailed the reporter arrests			0
@entity115 , the executive editor of the @entity9 , said in a statement wednesday night that " there was absolutely no justification " for @entity8 's arrest			0
@entity115 noted that the reporter was " illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers			0
then he followed officers ' instructions to leave a @entity125 's -- and after contradictory instructions on how to exit , he was slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed			0
that behavior was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news			0
" @entity132 , the @entity11 's @entity133 bureau chief , noted in a statement that @entity10 " has reported multiple times from @entity136			0
" according to @entity132 , @entity10 " said that the police resembled soldiers more than officers , and treated those inside the @entity6 as ' enemy combatants			1
' " @entity132 concluded his statement by saying , " @entity143 militarization has been among the most consequential and unnoticed developments of our time , and it is now beginning to affect press freedom			0
" complete coverage on the @entity4 shooting and protests			1

two journalists said police in @entity4 arrested them
they were released with no *criminal* charges
protests have continued since shooting death of @entity70
