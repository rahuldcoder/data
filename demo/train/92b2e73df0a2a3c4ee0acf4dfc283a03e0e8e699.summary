@entity0 -- it was a different @entity3 who arrived in @entity0 at the weekend			1
the man who landed on the campaign flight from @entity6 was unusually circumspect , even for a candidate not noted for unbridled displays of exuberance and emotion			0
but if the @entity12 front - runner seemed wooden and tense as he stood beside his old friend and onetime professional colleague @entity14 on sunday , he had his reasons			0
the @entity17 whistle - stop of @entity3 's current three - nation tour may prove the most crucial to his chances of defeating @entity20 in november			1
@entity12 strategists hope that the policy and press - the - flesh pilgrimage to @entity0 would help @entity3 sway the hearts and votes of traditionally @entity28 jews in battleground states			2
after a rocky showing in a visit to @entity33 , as well as a flap over the scheduling of a fund - raising dinner in the shadow of one of @entity39 's most solemn fast days , there was little margin here for error			0
more : ' @entity43 ' after @entity45 gaffe the visit has also served to illustrate the observation that at some point , all those who spend time in @entity0 find themselves suspended between the 21st century and the 1st			0
when his trip was still in the planning stage , events that occurred thousands of years ago had a direct effect on the former governor 's schedule , down to his plans for supper			0
" everything was already prepared , " began @entity61 , a @entity62 correspondent for @entity17 's mass - circulation @entity64 newspaper , opening a featured magazine spread on the eve of the visit with an account of the fund - raising dinner originally set for sunday evening			2
" the guest list was glamorous and elite , the menu abundant , the tickets a minimum of $ 50,000 , all proceeds to go to the @entity3 campaign , " she wrote			2
" only then were the organizers reminded of one small detail -- the dinner was scheduled for sunday , the ninth of the ( @entity82 ) month of @entity83 ( a fast day marking the anniversary of the destruction of the ancient @entity86 ) -- so that the wealthy @entity82 donors would not be able to participate at all			0
" campaign staffers , stung by criticism that they had paid little heed to @entity82 sensibilities , maintained that the dinner would , in any case , have taken place after the fast had ended			0
taking no chances , however , they moved the meal to a monday - morning breakfast just before @entity3 was to leave for a final travel stop in @entity99 , and took the unusual step of closing the fund - raiser to the press before ultimately reversing course and allowing some reporters to cover his remarks			1
more : @entity3 raises more than $ 1 million in @entity0 if , mindful of the @entity114 media frenzy sparked by @entity3 's having called preparations for the @entity45 " disconcerting , " @entity3 campaign officials sought to lower the profile of the @entity17 visit , their wish has been granted			1
even in @entity119 , the mass circulation daily newspaper owned by @entity123 billionaire and major @entity3 donor @entity115 , a guest at the @entity0 fundraiser -- the candidate 's arrival in @entity17 was placed on the sunday paper 's page nine			1
it appeared alongside a report on @entity20 , one day before the @entity3 visit , announcing a $ 70 million allocation for @entity17 rocket defense systems and signing a measure to bolster @entity123 - @entity17 security ties			1
nor has the visit stirred a public inured to all but the most apocalyptic of events			0
at week 's end , in the open market of @entity136 , downtown @entity0 's fragrant , teeming buffet of produce and political ferment , neither @entity3 nor @entity20 seemed to generate much in the way of affinity or even interest			1
" to tell you the truth , neither of them is to my taste , " said shopper @entity144 , 48 , sifting through a bin for the perfect eggplant			0
by contrast to the current candidates , @entity144 said , presidents @entity152 and @entity154 communicated genuine concern and warmth to @entity17			2
in the end , he said , " it does n't really matter who wins in november			0
i believe that @entity123 , the @entity123 people , will come through for us whenever we are in trouble , and the president will , too			2
" more : @entity3 says @entity0 is @entity17 's capital even some of those who side with @entity3 politically are decidedly qualified in their endorsements			1
" among all the sectors of the ( @entity123 ) population which i 'm not fond of , i may be least fond of the @entity12 , " said @entity169 , a television and radio host , during his show on @entity172 before @entity3 arrived			1
" regrettably , though , the @entity12 , with all their fouled up personal dealings , view the ( world and regional ) situation more accurately than do the @entity28 , who are much more personable , likable people			0
" he would much rather choose @entity20 as a partner for dinner conversation or a trip to the @entity183 , @entity169 told his @entity172 audience			2
but as a president , " even @entity3 the @entity185 , this cartoon of an @entity123 , is preferable to the @entity20 the @entity187			1
