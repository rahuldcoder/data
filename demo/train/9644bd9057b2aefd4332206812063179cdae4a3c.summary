a diverse group of young emerging leaders from all across @entity2 and the diaspora has come together to promote a unified vision for the continent and devise ways to move it forward			1
dubbed @entity2 2.0 , the advocacy group recently met in @entity9 , @entity10 , to bring together some 250 young businessmen , social entrepreneurs and opinion leaders from nearly 40 @entity2 countries to work toward a strategy that could help the continent leapfrog and accelerate its development			1
" if you think about it , @entity18 has an agenda for @entity2			2
@entity22 has an agenda , @entity24 , @entity25			0
it 's about time we @entity2 set an agenda for ourselves			2
" says @entity29 , founder of @entity2 2.0			1
the move comes as @entity2 undergoes a period of economic transformation , becoming increasingly attractive to international investors -- last year , the continent 's economy grew by nearly 5 % while six of the 10 fastest - growing economies in the world are currently from @entity2			1
survey : @entity2 attractive to investors -- but the world still needs convincing @entity43 economist @entity42 says the initiative is bringing together young @entity2 who want their continent to achieve growth and are interested in spreading the message that " @entity2 is a different place to do business			1
" the group has set the target of achieving a prosperous and inspiring @entity2 within the next 20 years			1
it has marked 2020 as a key milestone and works on a manifesto to raise awareness of what needs to be done until then			2
@entity29 calls @entity2 2.0 a social contract between the private sector , civil society and governments			1
he says the strategy for the group 's vision is based on four axis : uplifting @entity2 , creating and sharing the wealth , upgrading the infrastructure and setting up a growth - enabling environment			1
the group 's agenda includes pushing for the proposed @entity2 free trade area , a bloc that would span 26 countries , as well as a plan for better governance and boosting entrepreneurship			1
" ultimately , @entity76 2020 is the legacy of a generation on how they see the future of this continent and how they believe we can take it to the next level , " says @entity29			2
" we view ourselves also as a voice from the people who will ultimately inherit this continent			2
" @entity29 , who is also an investment and development officer at the @entity89 , says that one of the main challenges today is the willingness and acceptance of current decision makers to make a space for the youth			0
he adds that changing the mindset is crucial for the future prospects of the continent			0
" it 's about building an @entity2 ' can - do ' attitude that would get @entity2 to take ownership of their own future and to start rolling their sleeves to actually face the challenge ahead , " he says			1
@entity29 says @entity2 2.0 , which will hold its next symposium in @entity106 next year , is not just another initiative that 's hung up on endless discussions			1
instead , he calls it a ' @entity110 ' -- a terminology coined to describe a think tank that does things -- which aims to get their ideas endorsed by government leaders and put plans in place to execute them			0
" we are action - driven , " he says			0
" we are committing to implement it and we invite whoever believes in that to step in -- it is the responsibility of all and the society we are entering now in this 21st century and it is a society where everyone can be a leader , " he adds			0
while there 's still much to be improved before the group 's goals are implemented , some say that change is on the way			0
" we 've now just seen good elections in a couple of countries			0
we saw in a couple of countries they 've changed regulations			0
many more are doing better on the @entity141 , which means institutions are strengthening because in the end , that is what governance means , " notes @entity42			0
" governance means building strong institutions that are sustainable and survive long after leaders that created them have left			0
i think in that case we are doing well , " she adds .			0
