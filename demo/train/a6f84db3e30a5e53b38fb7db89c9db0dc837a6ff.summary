@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was a surprise , even for a journalist , to be driving down @entity5 , the city 's ceremonial thoroughfare , and to find myself swept into the chaotic aftermath of a disaster			1
i was rushing to a television studio at mid-morning and passing by the @entity12 , just minutes after the shooting			2
police were closing streets , stopping traffic , barking orders , brandishing machine guns , fingers on triggers			0
they soon imposed a lockdown , lasting until mid-afternoon			2
it is from that confinement that i began writing this			0
this is not supposed to happen in @entity1 -- much less @entity0 , its sleepy , self - absorbed capital			1
sentries do not die on duty at the @entity12 in this , our season of remembrance			0
politicians do not cower in the committee rooms of @entity37 , as its gothic hallways ring with gunfire			0
sharpshooters do not take up position on oxidized copper rooftops nearby , looking for men with long rifles			0
this is @entity1 , once known as " the @entity47			1
" now we have learned , like so many other countries , that terrible , unsentimental reality of the 21st century : it can happen here			2
when a gunman killed that lone soldier in front of the memorial today , when he -- and possibly his accomplices ( at this moment we do not know whether , who or how many ) -- then swept through the front doors of the @entity37 and began firing , something changed here			1
when hundreds of parliamentarians , gathering in their weekly party caucuses , pushed leather chairs and tables against the doors and barricaded themselves inside their rooms and offices , something changed here			0
and when the city center was locked down and a perimeter thrown up around the parliamentary precinct and beyond , confining thousands to their offices and shops , something changed here			0
it is too much a cliché to say -- as many surely will -- that @entity1 has lost its innocence today			1
@entity1 is surely not innocent ; a nation that marched into the maw of two world wars and left 100,000 of its sons in @entity80 understands a few things			1
that 's particularly true at this time of year , when @entity1 wear red poppies in their lapels until november 11 , @entity85			1
what we might say , though , is that @entity1 has lost its ignorance today -- and , perhaps , a good part of its complacency , too			1
this country is now chillingly aware that bad things can happen here , even in the seat of its democracy			1
many of us blithely thought it could not , or would not , happen			2
in 147 years as a democracy , we have never had a revolution , a civil war or a foreign invasion			2
abroad , we have not fought wars of conquest , we never had colonies , and we never fought alone			0
for years , we were the world 's leading peacekeepers , projecting the sense of compromise abroad that we practice at home			1
ours is an open , diverse society that has one of the highest levels of immigration in the world			1
it may be we thought ourselves impervious to pathologies and prejudices from home or abroad			0
then again , why should @entity1 be immune ? @entity1 fought in @entity120			1
we are a member of @entity122 and an historic ally of the @entity124			1
earlier this month our @entity37 voted to join the air campaign against the @entity126 in @entity127			0
this week or next , our warplanes will go into action there			0
we should not be surprised			0
there have been ominous signs			0
a plot was foiled a few years ago to bomb @entity37 and behead the prime minister			0
more recently , there have been increasing reports of " radicalized " @entity1 muslims joining jihadists in the @entity139			2
if what happened here is , in fact , an organized terror attack -- and even if it is something less , based simply on religious or ideological fervor -- it is another reminder of the dangers that have always come with a successful if complex society that aspires to a place in the world			2
unlike the @entity124 , @entity1 has little violent crime			1
it is among the safest of industrialized countries			0
murders , even mass slayings , can and do happen in @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 , its three largest cities			2
@entity0 , @entity1 's fourth - largest city , is a government town			1
it is @entity161 in @entity162 or @entity163 , @entity164			0
it is not @entity166 , @entity167 or @entity168			0
it 's a parochial place whose mayor thinks that replacing a crumbling public library or building light rail -- years after other cities in @entity1 have done both -- is a bold idea			1
so , it is jarring , alarming and sad that this has happened here , of all places			0
but it was naïve to think that a country of 35 million people , on the way to war in @entity127 , would not face this kind of violence one day			1
our long , sweet season of ignorance is over .			2

@entity191 was swept into chaotic aftermath of @entity0 soldier shot , was in lockdown
this is *n't* supposed to happen in @entity1 , known for peace , low crime , immigration , he says
he says @entity1 lost ignorance , complacency ; and why not ? it 's ally to @entity124 , player in the world
@entity191 : naïve to think that country on way to war would not face violence one day
