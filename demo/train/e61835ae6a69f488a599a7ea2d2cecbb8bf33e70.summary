-- " i 'm very at home working with mythology , " @entity0 says			2
@entity5 ' newest album , " @entity4 , " is a fable about one woman 's lost love and the emotional journey over the course of a night that helps her let go of a man and recapture her fire			1
along the way , she meets a shape shifting fox named @entity18 who acts as her guide to help navigate her through the predatory forces that lie within and around us			2
while " @entity4 " uses @entity5 ' familiar themes of spirit guides , magical elixirs , forces of nature and reclaiming female power , making this album was a new undertaking for her			1
instead of the electronic sound and production that marked her last few releases , " @entity4 " is stripped and essential			1
@entity5 returned to the piano and used the classical music format of a song cycle , where there is a common theme to the collection of songs and they are intended to be performed in sequence , to present her supernatural tale			1
twenty years after her groundbreaking solo debut , " @entity54 , " @entity0 talked to @entity3 about the irony of her getting kicked out of classical music school , women 's sharp and deadly tongues and why she has no desire to be 30 again			1
@entity3 : " @entity4 " is such an elaborate concept album			1
how did this story unfold , not just musically , but in your own head ? @entity5 : i was traveling about a year ago through @entity60 and the one thing that i began to hear from people is how much their lives could change in a day			1
really what this is about is a woman 's psychological experience and the shattering of a relationship			1
it 's about her emotional breakthrough that happens from dusk ' til dawn			1
i 've been working on a piece for the @entity76 for , like , 5,000 years , but that 's different because you have scenes with text			1
song cycles work on a poetic level , not like a play or musical			2
i wanted there to be a poetic level to this ( album ) , where the poems come to life , and the emotion , but the plotline is n't necessarily in the songs themselves			1
for a song cycle to work , you have to feel these things when you hear them and you either have an emotional reaction to it or you do n't			2
the plotline is something that gets woven together in the backstory			0
but when ( classical music label ) @entity101 / @entity100 approached me and said , we heard you 're working on this musical , what about if you did a 21st century song cycle based on classical themes ? i said , " what about if @entity109 ( do n't ) ? " @entity3 : you obviously came around			2
@entity5 : yeah , but i mean , @entity111 , it 's a tall order ! @entity3 : were n't you kicked out of the @entity113 when you were 5 for being too radical and not adhering to their classical norms ? @entity5 : yeah , that 's kinda funny			1
@entity3 : you had n't thought about it before ? @entity5 : i have , but it 's true			1
i was kicked out because they did n't think i could embrace the classical path			0
the dean that is there now has reached out in the last few months to my dad and has said that the @entity113 is a very , very different place of learning than it was in the ' 70s			0
it would need to be because they were n't anywhere near where @entity101 / @entity100 was and this is one of the greatest classical places of all time			0
@entity3 : the musical you talked about for the @entity76 is ' @entity138 , ' based on the book by @entity140 ? @entity5 : it was , but we changed it because our story became very different			1
@entity3 : what happened ? are there any aspects that remain ? @entity5 : she floats			1
i did n't really like her in the book			0
i felt it was from a man 's perspective and i had no idea about how she felt that she had this incredible ability , but was treated like she had a disability			2
it was very much through the eyes of the patriarchal male force and i never got a sense of her , her friends , her perspective and what her life would have been like			0
so it 's a very different world , our world			2
the key things are about power and about growing up and realizing as you grow up that there are consequences for the choices you make , especially when you get seduced by power			0
@entity3 : you have a daughter , @entity180 , who is a preteen			0
what do you say to her about nurturing herself and cultivating her interests and being aware of her own power ? @entity5 : i think the big thing for her is the peer group , which inspired some of the musical and seeing how important the peer group is for that age			1
a comment from a friend , especially things about weight or appearance , how they look , can be so damaging that , as a mother sometimes , you have to think , ok , how am i going to say something that is going to neutralize what a friend said who seemed to want to wound ? sometimes they do want to wound each other because you know how it is with girls			0
i do n't know how it happens , but they know how to flay somebody just by licking their lips			0
@entity3 : but there 's also a great sense of community that girls and women have when there 's not a sense of competition or jealousy			2
@entity5 : that 's right			1
and yet all of us have sometimes begrudgingly looked at somebody else and said , well , i 'm happy things are going well for them but i 've worked just as hard ! we 've all had that moment of , yes i 'm happy for her and would n't it be great if @entity230 would smile on me because i 've been an elf working at @entity0 's shop for years			2
@entity3 : the track ' carry ' stood out sonically because , even without knowing that it was the closing track on the album , you could really get a sense of a dawn breaking and a wholeness that had been restored			2
@entity5 : i hope women can take that away			1
as the sun sets , we 've all had those nights where you question your choices and where your life is going			0
sometimes it seems like we 're closer to our manicurists than we are our own souls			0
we have to find ways to get in touch with that and to listen to it and to hear it			0
@entity3 : it has been 20 years since ' @entity54 ' was released			1
do you have any different opinions or reflections on that album today ? @entity5 : twenty years ago , you do n't really think about the self - worth challenges that you 'll have becoming 50			1
i do n't mean a successful person or intelligent person , i mean a desirable person			0
and i do n't mean in a tight dress , i 'm just talking about walking with each step and having a wonderment and wanting to be exactly where you are			0
some people say , i 'd give anything to be 30 again			0
well , i really would n't			0
i did n't enjoy being 30			0
making ' @entity54 ' was great , but i did n't have a calm and i did n't know how to laugh			0
i think becoming a mom is the greatest gift that ever happened to me			0
i say that 's one of the key shifts in my life that has gotten me to this place today			2
but with each year , you always have to be listening , be listening to your own soul , be growing .			0
