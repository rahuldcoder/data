@entity0 -- two hit - and - run deaths in rural @entity4 just a few miles apart highlight a disturbing problem about data collection on possible hate crimes			1
last summer , 61 - year - old african - american sunday school teacher @entity8 was hit and killed by an 18 - year - old white driver			2
the teen told @entity12 deputies he thought he hit a deer but the driver 's two passengers said he steered straight for @entity8			2
one passenger said he could see that @entity8 was black			0
the killing has sparked outrage in the local @entity20 - @entity20 community			0
civil rights groups have demanded that police prosecute @entity8 ' killing as a hate crime			1
nonetheless , prosecutors chose not to			0
there was no evidence , authorities said , to suggest a racial motive			0
the driver was charged with murder			0
he has not yet pleaded in the case			0
related : three plead guilty in @entity4 hate crime in another hit and run , 41 - year - old african - american @entity34 was found dead along a @entity38 road in november 2009			1
his mother , @entity39 , says for three years she had heard nothing about any police investigation into her son 's death until @entity1 began asking about the case			2
update : @entity39 case did n't have to go cold @entity1 received no response after calling the @entity38 sheriff 's department , but just hours after @entity1 's call , a sheriff 's investigator drove to @entity39 's house			1
" he came in and said he was the investigator , " she told @entity1			0
" he told me he apologized for no one coming out before now			0
and he told me that the first investigators they had did n't do anything			0
" if police suspect @entity39 's death was a hate crime , they 're not saying			1
and even if @entity39 's death turns out to be a hate crime , there 's a chance it wo n't even be reported			1
" the data sucks , " said @entity65 of the @entity66 , which tracks the issue			0
" hate crime data as the @entity71 reports is underreported by an ungodly amount			1
" in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 there were zero hate crime incidents reported in the state of @entity4 , according to the @entity71			1
" states like @entity77 have thousands of hate crimes , and the state of @entity4 with its record of racial animus has none ? " said @entity65			1
" ' federal law has required states to collect hate crime data since the early 1990s			1
@entity87 has defined a hate crime as a " criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender 's bias against a race , religion , disability , ethnic origin or sexual orientation			1
" but states do n't have to report their data to the @entity71 if they do n't want to			2
four states -- @entity104 , @entity4 , @entity105 and @entity106 -- do n't even have a @entity109 ( @entity108 ) program			2
the result , critics say , is a federal data system that costs $ 1 million - plus but offers very little help to authorities who investigate , identify and track hate crimes			1
" we can only report by the numbers we are given , " said the @entity71 's @entity117 , who says the lack of data could be because of a lack of state funding			2
in states that do have @entity108 programs , the @entity71 offers training for state and local law enforcement on how to collect and report hate crime data			1
on @entity130 , 26 senators have asked @entity132 attorney general @entity131 to expand @entity108 programs to include tracking of hate crimes against @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			1
last year 's deadly attack on a @entity140 @entity137 temple raised awareness about crimes targeting @entity137			2
" without accurate , nuanced reporting of these crimes , it is more difficult for federal , state , and local law enforcement to assess and respond to the particular threat that the @entity137 community faces , " the senators said last month in a letter to @entity131			0
if authorities do n't know how many hate crimes are committed , it 's difficult to get an accurate picture of whether hate crime laws are effective			1
in a 2011 killing that received national attention , authorities in @entity4 did prosecute the hit - and - run murder of @entity161 , an @entity20 auto plant worker , as a hate crime			1
the attack was captured on video by a hotel security camera			0
@entity167 's accused killer , @entity161 , who is white , pleaded guilty last year to murder and hate - crime charges and was sentenced to life in prison			2
so how many possible hate crimes are actually committed throughout the @entity132 each year ? no one really knows			1
in fact , the difference between data from different federal agencies is alarming			0
a survey by the @entity179 counts around 190,000 hate crimes a year , compared with the @entity71 , which counts somewhere between 6,000 and 8,000 , @entity65 said			1
here are some of the reasons behind the gap : instead of using information from law enforcement -- like the @entity71 -- the @entity179 uses information directly from victims			2
it 's based on interviews with thousands of households each year where people say whether they believe they were victims of hate crimes			1
" sometimes victims do n't go to the police , " said @entity117			0
" and sometimes the police report is not filed			0
" and if police do n't know about a crime , they ca n't report it to the @entity71			2
the @entity198 statistics , which supporters say generally provide a more accurate picture of crime , cost $ 23 million more a year to produce than the @entity71 's annual hate crime stats			1
the @entity71 stats show the following trends in hate crimes reported by states from 2008 - 2011 : -- crimes linked to bias against sexual orientation increased from 16.7 % to 20.8 %			1
-- crimes linked to religious , ethnic and disability bias were unchanged			0
-- racially motivated hate crimes -- the most commonly reported type -- decreased from 51.3 % to 46.9 %			1
back in @entity4 , @entity39 's pain over the death of her son has been resurfacing as police investigate the case more than three years later			2
she believes it could have been racially motivated			0
" i would hate to say it , but it could , " she said			0
" being a mother , i want the truth to come out			0
" in the end , she may never know			0
