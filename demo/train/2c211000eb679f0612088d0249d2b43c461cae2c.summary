-- with such events as men 's downhill and women 's slopestyle , sunday 's competition at the @entity7 may best described by the @entity9 motto : faster , higher , stronger			1
here are five things to watch : men 's downhill finals @entity14 's @entity13 , who may be the old man on the mountain at age 36 , is looking to become king of the hill , er , downhill during sunday 's @entity9 finals			1
he 's laid down some of the fiercest and fastest training runs in the lead - up to what is widely considered one of @entity24 's marquee events , and nobody doubts he will push it to the limit to add a gold medal to his previous @entity7 haul of one gold , three silvers and a bronze			1
as those who follow the sport know , it only takes one bobble , one skid , one miscalculation on the 2.2 - mile course at @entity39 , and it could be all over			0
@entity13 's competitors in the downhill are n't going to just let him walk away with a medal , he 's going to have to fight for it among a fast field			1
who to watch : @entity46 of @entity47 , who took silver in the men 's downhill and the gold in the super-g during the @entity53 in 2010			1
he put up the second - fastest time on saturday 's training run behind @entity13 , according to @entity55			2
@entity57 's @entity56 , who took the gold in the event in @entity60 , and @entity62 's @entity61 , whose training run friday on the course eclipsed @entity13 , also are likely to be in the medal hunt			1
women 's slopestyle finals at age 23 , @entity68 of the @entity14 is considered one of the pioneers of women 's snowboard slopestyle			1
( think downhill obstacle course with rails and jumps			0
) so perhaps it is fitting that she is one of the odds - on favorites to medal in the event , making its @entity9 debut at the @entity7			0
but do n't count out @entity62 's @entity84 , who qualified for the event semifinal and final with the highest - scoring run			2
as @entity88 of @entity89 proved saturday by winning an unexpected gold medal in men 's slopestyle , anything is possible			1
who else to watch : @entity95 's @entity94 , the 2010 @entity9 gold medalist in the halfpipe , is a force to be reckoned with after putting in a solid qualifying run			2
figure skating team finals it 's the final day of the @entity9 debut of the team figure skating competition , and the field of 10 has been narrowed down to five teams			0
here 's what to know : @entity107 , @entity108 , the @entity14 , @entity109 and @entity110 are vying for medals			2
so how do they do that ? on sunday , the teams will put forward skaters to compete in the men 's , women 's and ice dancing free programs			1
in armchair @entity9 - speak , that means the long programs			0
the team with the highest overall score wins the gold , second highest gets the silver , third highest			0
... you get the idea			0
no ? tune in to watch it			0
men 's skiathlon 30k finals ski - what - a - thon ? @entity134 , or in everyday language competitive cross-country skiing			2
think of it this way			0
it 's a 30 - kilometer race where skiers switch out their classic cross country skis after 15 kilometers to skating skis , where they ski for another 15 kilometers			0
@entity57 's @entity143 , a dominant force in the sport , is considered the favorite going into the race			1
who else to watch : @entity148 of @entity47 , who won two gold medals in @entity60 in 2010 , is known for his sprint finishes , and @entity151 of @entity47 , who finished second at last year 's @entity134 , are expected to be in the hunt for medals			1
men 's individual normal hill ski jumping finals ski jumping seems like an adrenaline junkie 's dream , strapping on a pair of skis , flying down a ramp and launching into the air			2
and it 's pretty cool to watch , too			0
if the qualifying rounds are any indication , the finals on sunday should not disappoint			0
@entity169 's @entity168 , the reigning @entity170 champion , is the favorite			0
who else to watch : @entity176 of @entity57 , who is trying to win a fifth @entity9 gold , @entity174 's @entity173 and @entity62 's @entity175 are also contenders .			1

@entity13 of @entity89 is considered a gold medal favorite in men 's downhill
@entity14 @entity68 and @entity62 @entity184 will face off in women 's slopestyle
@entity57 's @entity143 and @entity47 's @entity148 will fight it out in the skiathlon
