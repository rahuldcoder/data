@entity1 's plagiarism apology tour took to the sky wednesday as the " @entity4 " actor hired an airplane to sky - write " i 'm sorry @entity7			1
" @entity8 is the author whose story @entity1 admits he copied for his short film " @entity12 " without crediting @entity8			1
but it was a cloudy apology , raising suspicion that @entity1 has moved on from saying he 's sorry to @entity8 and is now taunting @entity8 fans and @entity1 critics who have attacked him online in the two weeks since he was busted			1
the creativity shown by @entity1 in more than two dozen @entity18 postings of apology raises the question of why such a fertile mind needed to borrow ideas			1
those tweets included the words " naivet√© , " " embarrassed , " " regret , " " terribly wrong , " " deeply sorry , " and " hurtful and thoughtless			1
" the apology tweets started clearly enough on december 16 : " @entity27 embarrassed that i failed to credit @ danielclowes for his original graphic novella @entity31 , which served as my inspiration			1
i was truly moved by his piece of work & i knew that it would make a poignant & relevant short			0
i apologize to all who assumed i wrote it			0
" transforming apologies but three days later , it appeared @entity1 was frustrated that the online attacks against him continued			2
@entity42 emerged in his tweets : " i want to thank all of you who have written in and created groups and protested			0
even though i wish i had n't made so many of you angry			0
" even here , @entity1 plagiarizes -- maybe as a hidden treat for those obsessed with nailing him for plagiarism			1
it mirrors @entity55 founder @entity54 's landmark apology in 2006 for a failure in his then - fledgling social network : " even though i wish i had n't made so many of you angry , i am glad we got to hear you			2
" sincere - sounding apologies continued for another week , including this on december 28 : " when you 've made a mistake you should apologise			0
but more importantly -- most important of all -- you 've got to learn from your mistakes			0
" this was a cut - and - paste ripoff of @entity70 deputy prime minister @entity69 's 2012 apology for his party 's breaking a pledge not to support a student tuition fee hike			2
it even included the @entity70 spelling of apologize			0
by december 31 , @entity1 was mocking those who refused to accept that he was sorry for copying from @entity8 : " i am sorry for all the plagiarized tweets , they all were unintelligent , ambiguous and needlessly hurtful			1
you have my apologies for offending you for thinking i was being serious instead of accurately realizing i was mocking you			0
" @entity1 borrowed the phrase " unintelligent , ambiguous and needlessly hurtful " directly from a 2011 apology by film director @entity84 after he was banned from the @entity85 for remarks about @entity87			1
on @entity88 , @entity1 went old school and used a predecessor to the 140 - character @entity18 forum			2
he hired a single - engine airplane to write through the blue skies of @entity95 : " i am sorry @entity7			0
" he then tweeted a photo of the airborne apology , because it was unlikely the author , who lives in @entity99 , would have seen it for the short time it was visible before the words were gone with the wind			1
the text that accompanied the tweet posted wednesday night read : @entity107 : - vapor floating in the atmosphere - remote servers used to share data - to make @entity112 or transparent if @entity1 is considering a sequel to his short but controversial film about an online film critic , perhaps he already has a script for a movie about an actor who finds his voice on @entity18			1
not everyone 's laughing for @entity8 ' editor , the plot of @entity1 's film sounded awfully familiar , even before he saw it			1
" i presumed that @entity1 would be smart enough to change everything just enough to make it his own thing and shield himself from any legal liability , even if it did n't excuse him from being a weasel			0
which is why , when i actually started watching it , i almost spit out my coffee when i realized he lifted the script , word for word , " said @entity133 , associate publisher at @entity134 , in a statement			0
" the more i think about this , the more i 'm fairly convinced that @entity1 at least subconsciously knew what he was doing , " @entity133 continued			0
" he never completely claims ownership of the script , as near as i can tell ; the credits conspicuously do not credit a screenwriter or source material , stating simply , ' a film by @entity1			2
' when you look at that , coupled with the quote he gave ' @entity150 ' about how details in his own life informed the script , it 's clear he 's trying to claim authorship without ever stating outright , ' i wrote this ! ' which makes it even more egregiously shameless , in my mind			1
" and even if @entity8 accepts the flurry of apologies , another publisher is considering legal action against @entity1			2
@entity167 publisher @entity166 sent a statement to @entity169 on thursday accusing @entity1 of " extensive plagiarism of the @entity167 book ' @entity172 and the @entity173 ' by @entity174			2
" @entity1 's short graphic novel " @entity176 " allegedly mirrors passages from the book			1
" we are puzzled by the fact that , considering the egregious plagiarism of our author 's work by mr. @entity183 , he has taken such a cavalier attitude with regard to this matter , " @entity166 said			0
" we have been conferring with legal counsel over the holidays with the intention to pursue our legal remedies should we not hear from mr. @entity183 promptly to remedy this matter			0

editor : actor 's action was " egregiously shameless "
@entity1 admitted last month he borrowed @entity7 ' story for his short film
apology tweets include words " embarrassed , " " regret , " " terribly wrong , " " deeply sorry "
@entity1 plagiarism apology tweets appear plagiarized
