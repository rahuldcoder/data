@entity0 -- president @entity2 met monday with @entity4 's sixth prime minister in five years to try to strengthen ties with the @entity7 economic power still struggling after last year 's earthquake and tsunami that triggered a nuclear power plant meltdown			1
the president and visiting @entity4 prime minister @entity11 started bilateral talks at the @entity13 , to be followed by a working lunch and then a joint news conference			1
@entity4 's volatile domestic politics , amid economic sluggishness and the march 2011 tsunami - triggered nuclear crisis , have made continuity a challenge in relations between the @entity23 enemies turned industrial allies			1
@entity11 came to power in september , and last week , the two governments addressed a thorny issue of recent years with a plan for the @entity29 to relocate about half of its 19,000 @entity31 based on @entity32 to other places in the @entity7			1
while the relocation faces some opposition in @entity38 and @entity4 , the announcement of an agreement signaled a desire by the countries to work together on a way forward in bilateral relations			2
in addition , the two leaders will probably discuss @entity46 's fledgling nuclear weapons program and political changes in @entity48			2
another topic expected to come up monday is possible @entity4 membership in the @entity51 , a trade alliance that is part of @entity2 's strategy to increase @entity29 exports and influence in the @entity56			1

last month , @entity11 issued a sobering and reflective assessment of his country 's recovery a year after the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake , tsunami and nuclear meltdown at the @entity78 plant			1

only two of @entity4 's 53 nuclear reactors remain in operation , with others taken offline for routine maintenance and then idled			1
the strain on the grid with summer approaching is raising concern in corporate @entity4 , which fears it wo n't have enough power to run production lines in the country			0
" in case there is a short - term supply and demand gap of energy , it could cause downward pressure on the economy			0
we must avoid that , " @entity11 told @entity1 last month			0
the prime minister faces not just the nuclear cleanup and disaster reconstruction , but an economy facing intense pressure			1
@entity4 's currency , the yen , remains at historic highs versus the @entity29 dollar			1

@entity4 's debt - to - gross domestic product ratio is highest among developed nations , topping 200 %			1
the country is also aging at an unprecedented rate			0

" the centerpiece of the prime minister 's economic policy has been the doubling of the country 's sales tax , from the current 5 % to 10 % by october 2015			2
the plan remains unpopular with voters , but the prime minister has repeatedly endorsed fiscal responsibility in the wake of the shrinking economy			2
