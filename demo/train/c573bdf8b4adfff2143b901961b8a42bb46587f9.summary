@entity0 , @entity1 -- the marshes here have long been a refuge for the @entity6 living in @entity1 's bayou			1
" we came to live here because it was marshland , where nobody else wanted to live , " said @entity8 , the chairman of the @entity9			0
the tribe is made up of about 700 members whose ancestors were forced from their lands and resettled to @entity1 more than 100 years ago			1
that refuge , already strained from coastal erosion , is facing a new menace : the oil spill spreading uncontrollably across the @entity22			1
on saturday , the same day that the state closed fishing in the area , @entity8 addressed some of the tribal members in the town 's cinder block church			1
before the tribal meeting , the members recite a prayer in a @entity35 dialect , a language picked up by their ancestors from @entity38 settlers generations ago			2
several men have come directly from hauling in the last catch of shrimp and blue crab			0
they sit in the pews still wearing their calf - length rubber fishing boots			2
@entity8 , a veteran fisherman and oil rig worker , does n't downplay the threat growing just a few miles away			2
" this could be the end of our way of life , " @entity8 tells the crowd from the altar			1
he is wearing a black t - shirt that reads " i am a @entity56 and i count			0
" @entity58 expressions cover the faces in the small crowd in the church			0
people ask if there has been any response from a letter sent to @entity1 gov. @entity66 asking for help			1
since the tribe is still fighting for federal recognition , it is not empowered to appeal to @entity72			1
that recognition , tribe members said , would give them special protections and expanded powers to push for the help they say they need			1
they are uncertain of how to negotiate with @entity80 , which has set up an office on the second floor of the church to hire people to place protective booms off the coast			0
people complain they feel cut off and alone			0
the tribal members say no federal or state officials have come to advise them on what to do			1
however , a small delegation of @entity6 has made the long journey from @entity92 to share their experience dealing with the aftermath of the 1989 @entity95			1
" there were severe human impacts with the workers who tried to clean up the oil spill in @entity92 , " said @entity96 , who spent 14 hours flying to get to @entity1			1
" these are persistent impacts , they do n't go away			0
" but if this area is going to be protected from the encroaching oil spill , the residents of @entity0 will have to do it themselves			1
taking a boom supplied by @entity80 , @entity8 and about 25 other tribal members set off in their fishing boats to seal off their wetlands from the oil , which is already reaching the shoreline			1
before they leave , a @entity80 worker inspects the boats and orders the men -- most who have been fishing for all their lives -- to wear life jackets			1
@entity8 says if @entity80 provided him with more boom and agreed to hire more workers , he could probably get 100 people on the job			0
what concerns the tribe the most is a small island off the coast of @entity0 they call their sacred grounds			1
it is the land where many of their ancestors are buried			0
hurricanes carried away the headstones years ago			0
it is bare ground except for a large , simple white cross			2
from the back of their boats -- some with names like " @entity141 " and " @entity142 " -- the workers place the boom on the water 's edge			2
several large globs of a reddish - brown oily substance are floating inside the boom			0
the clumps have been spotted in other areas where the tribal members fish			2
but this is the closest they 've seen it to @entity156			0
it is not the first time the tribe has made a stand to protect the burial ground			1
in the 1970s , @entity8 said , tribal members stood on the shores of the sacred ground cradling shotguns and rifles to face down oil company workers intent on dredging the land for a pipeline			1
the oil company dredged elsewhere , but the results were still catastrophic			2
tribe members say the deep cuts made through the marshes brought in saltwater and led to coastal erosion			2
that erosion has turned the once abundant oak trees in @entity0 -- which means " @entity181 " in @entity35 -- into empty husks			0
erosion has also turned areas where people once lived into waterlogged marshes or open water			0
in 2005 , @entity187 brought up to 8 feet of water to parts of the town , @entity8 said			0
adding oil to such a storm surge would prove disastrous			2
" if we get oil up in here and you get a hurricane , i do n't see them letting us come back , " @entity8 said			0
" who 's going to clean that after , how long is that going to take ? " but for tribe member @entity201 , the disaster already has struck			1
a single mother of four , she ekes out a living from catching shrimp and blue crab off her small boat			0
@entity201 's face is a deep brown from a life working in the sun. on the last day of fishing before the state closes the water because of the spill , @entity201 unloads baskets of blue crab in the pouring rain			1
once the crab is on the dock , she is out work but with mouths still to feed			0
" i do n't know what i do next , this is all i know how to do , " @entity201 said			0
" i do n't know what i do tomorrow			0

@entity22 oil spill threatens sacred burial ground of @entity1 's @entity228
most of the tribe 's 700 members also rely on fishing and fear the spill could end their way of life
members say no federal or state officials have advised them on dealing with the disaster
*native* americans from @entity92 told the tribe how they dealt with the 1989 @entity245 spill
