-- activists in @entity2 utilizing new media tools to call for change " face a repressive and intolerant government , " and risk harassment as well as imprisonment , according to @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
a report by the rights group , " challenging the @entity11 : stories of @entity17 in @entity2 , " released wednesday , accuses @entity2 authorities of " arresting , prosecuting , and attempting to silence rights defenders and to quash their calls for change			2
" " independent activists in @entity2 have little to protect them from the repressive practices of their government , " said @entity18 , @entity2 researcher for @entity8			1
" it 's time for other countries to break their silence and tell @entity2 to allow independent activism , " @entity18 told @entity0			1
activists in @entity2 -- an absolute monarchy where dissent is little tolerated -- have increasingly turned to social media sites to express growing frustration with the government			1
online participation by @entity2 has increased so much that the country now has one of the highest usage rates of @entity38 in the world			2
as the government will not allow for the formation and licensing of independent human rights bodies inside the country , many internet - based nongovernmental rights organizations have been established , and frequently report on human rights abuses within the ultraconservative kingdom			1
according to @entity8 , " despite the authorities ' efforts to block online content , @entity2 -- at least 49 % of whom have internet access -- use internet forums to bypass heavily censored state media			1
" the report also highlights the stories of 11 prominent @entity2 political and civil activists and " their struggles to resist government efforts to suppress them , " according to @entity8			1
one of those activists , @entity62 , was recently sentenced to three months in jail by a court in @entity65 for signing a petition critical of @entity2 authorities two years ago			2
" human rights activists are having a very bad time right now in @entity2 , " @entity68 told @entity0			1
" authorities do n't want anyone to speak out loudly and when we do , the government feels they lose control			0
" @entity68 , a prominent human rights lawyer , said he is appealing his sentence , but that he 's now also being tried by the @entity75 ( which prosecutes terrorists ) in the country 's capital city , @entity79			1
according to @entity68 , he 's been charged with " setting up an unlicensed organization " and " breaking allegiance with the @entity2 king , " among other things			2
@entity68 believes he is being prosecuted solely for his activism and holds out little hope he 'll remain free much longer			0
" i 'm sure that i will be convicted , " he told @entity0			0
another @entity2 activist highlighted in the report is @entity68 's brother - in - law and client , @entity88			2
@entity88 was recently sentenced by a @entity90 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for violating the nation 's anti-cybercrime law			0
in jail since june 2012 , @entity88 was found guilty of insulting @entity96 through his website and in television comments			0
@entity88 's legal troubles started shortly after he started the @entity101 website in 2008 , as a way to encourage discussion about religion ; it did n't take long for some clerics to brand him an unbeliever and apostate			0
@entity88 's sentence is being appealed			0
the case of @entity111 is also included in the report			0
it calls him " a political activist and poet from the @entity118 city of @entity119			0
" @entity8 says @entity2 security forces have arrested @entity111 , a @entity122 , four times over the past ten years and tortured him			2
" @entity2 's conviction of eight prominent activists in 2013 alone for their peaceful activities has been largely met with silence by @entity2 's friends in the @entity128 and @entity129 , " said @entity8 's @entity18			1
" it 's time for other countries speak up and tell @entity2 to end its repression campaign			1
" despite repeated attempts , @entity0 was unable to reach @entity2 's @entity134 or @entity135 for comment			0
rights groups have frequently accused @entity2 authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans			2
many were outraged in march this year , when two of the country 's most prominent reform advocates , @entity146 and @entity147 were sentenced to 10 and 11 years in prison respectively			0
at the time , @entity149 called their trial " just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom 's human - rights activists			1
" asked in january about accusations that @entity2 is cracking down on dissent , major general @entity155 , spokesman for the @entity2 @entity134 , told @entity0 , " at the @entity134 , our area of responsibility is security			0
" he added , " my understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now			0
nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts			0
" according to @entity8 , " @entity2 does not have a written penal code , leaving judges free to issue sentences based on their own interpretations of the @entity171 and the teachings of the @entity173 , the two agreed - upon sources of @entity96 @entity176 law			2
" " defendants accused of political offenses -- including human rights activists -- are often sentenced by the @entity75 , set up to try terrorism - related cases			1
this court sometimes denies defendants the most basic fair trial guarantees , including the right to a lawyer , and passes sentences in closed proceedings			0
" despite repeated criticism of @entity2 's human rights record by numerous rights groups , in november the kingdom was elected to a three year term on the @entity193 ' @entity192 .			1
