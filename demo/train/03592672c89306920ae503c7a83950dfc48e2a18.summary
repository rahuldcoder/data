-- @entity1 , producer of " @entity2 , " is under heat for his live - tweet - turned - hoax aboard @entity5 over @entity6 weekend			1
his live tweets about a feud with a disgruntled passenger went viral and garnered him tons of attention and sympathy			2
turned out the whole thing was made up			2
@entity1 admitted it on @entity14			1
should @entity1 not have made up the woman in 7a whom he called @entity16 ? maybe			1
but then again he 's in the creative industry			2
to me , what 's more fascinating is how quick we are to jump on any interesting human interaction			2
@entity1 conceived of a short story on @entity14 and it was so good that hungry media outlets seized on it and spread the story like wildfire			1
if @entity1 wanted publicity , he got it			1
if the media wanted a good and verified story , it should have done its job of fact - checking			1
@entity1 just happened to live - tweet a fiction			1
but the bigger issue is : is it ok to live - tweet other people 's conversations ? based on my own experiences , i 'd say yes , to an extent			1
a few weeks ago , it was an unusually warm night in @entity42			0
i had a friend in town and we went up to the roof to enjoy the view			0
more groups of people came up and cluttered the smallish space			2
suddenly a couple burst on to the roof			0
simply put , they began breaking up on the roof , in front of everyone			0
it all seemed so familiar to me , the back and forth , the arguing between the couple			0
i 'll tweet out what they 're saying , i thought			2
i did n't think too much about it			0
it just seemed like a relatable situation			0
the breakup , # roofbreakup as it became known , started to pick up steam , and eventually went viral			0
i began to receive messages and tweets and e-mails from all over the world , with the overwhelming majority expressing their delight and joy in reading the tweet - sized transcript			1
but not everyone condones this behavior			0
@entity77 , a social media content editor at @entity79 , posted an essay on medium entitled , " please stop live - tweeting people 's private conversations			1
" @entity77 mentions my # roofbreakup , @entity1 's airplane feud ( before it was revealed to be a hoax ) , a date someone overheard on @entity88 , and the time where @entity90 overheard former @entity93 director @entity92 's phone conversation with reporters			1
@entity77 says she believes it to be " unethical and unfair to regular people to broadcast their lives to an audience against their will			2
" she 's right in some ways			2
however , except in the case of @entity92 , the people in her examples are anonymous			1
they just as easily could have been fiction , as in the case of @entity1 's airplane feud , where the characters existed in an invented scenario to evoke people 's sympathy			1
but there is no harm if a conversation with universal appeal is shared publicly as long as the people remain anonymous			1
for example , with my own live - tweeting of # roofbreakup , i did n't give any clues as to who the couple were			1
when sifting through the endless responses sent my way in the wake of # roofbreakup , time and time again i came across " oh i 've been there before " and " sounds like my last breakup			0
" the only explanation for the level of exposure that my # roofbreakup got is that people connected with the situation			2
it was gossiping in the 21st century , except instead of using specifics and pointing out the people , it remained " guy " and " @entity138			2
" i did n't live - tweet a couple 's private conversation ; i live - tweeted any two people 's breakup conversation			1
technology is quickly changing our lives and we are adapting accordingly			0
it 's so easy to communicate and share information and knowledge instantly			2
and now we have to deal with having private conversations in public spaces			0
but private and public are not always distinctly drawn lines			0
sometimes the two mesh and things get blurry			0
as humans , we 're intrigued with the lives of other people			0
when other people 's lives parallel ours , we feel less alone in the world			1
just as often as you read a headline about a natural disaster , you will see a headline about a personal disaster			0
elaborate proposal videos go viral daily			0
couples fighting in public get on @entity171			0
go ahead and share the story you overheard on the street or cafe , just make sure to not give away the personal identities			1
a story with no specific names attached is no less fake than fiction			1
you may wonder : did the # roofbreakup really happen ? you can believe me or not , but i promise you it did			0
had i witnessed the breakup on my roof five or six years ago , i would have told everyone i knew about the crazy exchange			0
i would have walked back into my apartment and re-enacted it for my then roommates , embellishing and recalling every line i possibly could			0
but i witnessed the breakup in 2013 , and i communicated it in a way that seemed just as normal as any other			0
it just happens that i can tell the story to more people			1
