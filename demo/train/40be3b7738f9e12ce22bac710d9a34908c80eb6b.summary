-- a decade ago , almost all doctors kept paper charts on every patient			0
that is changing quickly as laptops become as common as stethoscopes in exam rooms			0
recent hacking attacks have raised questions about how safe that data may be			0
here are some frequently asked questions about this evolution underway in @entity14 medicine , and the government programs sparking the change			0
are my medical records stored electronically ? at least some of the information you share with your doctor or any hospital or clinic where you 've been treated is probably stored on a computer			1
it 's pretty common for most hospitals , clinics and doctors ' offices to digitally store your basic information including your name , address and insurance company , the same way many retailers do			2
it 's also likely that at least some information about your specific medical conditions is linked to that data			2
health care providers have been using computers to help them get paid for decades			1
that means many computer - generated bills sent to you and / or your insurance company contain medical details like the conditions you were treated for , prescriptions and referrals to specialists			1
where things are really changing quickly is in the use of electronic records for day - to - day patient care			1
until recently , most doctors used paper charts to record information generated during patient visits			0
but the 2009 economic stimulus package offered doctors and hospitals tens of thousands of dollars to help buy computers and software designed to replace paper charts			1
adoption was slow at first , but as of june most hospitals and close to half of all doctors in @entity14 report that they are using systems that qualify for those payments			2
some are aggressively digitizing older records stored on paper ; others are not			1
does the @entity75 require doctors and hospitals to use electronic medical records ? no. the stimulus package , which pre-dates @entity75 , offers doctors , hospitals and some other health providers money to help them upgrade from paper to digital records , but the @entity75 does not			1
nor does it require digital record use			0
the health law does offer bonus payments to health care providers that can prove they 're more efficient and not unnecessarily duplicating tests and procedures			1
electronic records make that easier			2
the @entity75 also includes penalties for those who fail to meet performance measures such as keeping people from returning to hospitals because they were n't treated properly the first time			1
more hospitals are starting to use electronic records to track patients , coordinate inpatient and post-hospital care and to record how well they 're performing in an effort to win bonuses and avoid penalties put in place by the @entity75			1
if electronic medical records are so common , why ca n't i e-mail my doctor ? some patients can			1
but concerns about privacy and payment mean many doctors would rather communicate with patients on the phone or face - to - face			0
standard e-mail is n't secure enough to meet the standards of @entity14 's umbrella medical privacy law , known as @entity121			0
that 's why many doctors do n't communicate with patients via e-mail , and continue to send prescriptions and referrals via fax. some electronic records systems offer secure " patient portals " that allow patients and doctors to communicate electronically			2
more doctors and hospitals will have to start offering this service if they want to qualify for the maximum amount of stimulus act payments for going digital			2
but not all insurance companies will pay doctors for the time they spend communicating electronically , so many require patients to schedule an office visit instead			0
how secure are my electronic medical records ? as more doctors and hospitals go digital with medical records , the size and frequency of data breaches are alarming privacy advocates and public health officials			1
although health care providers face serious penalties if they allow patients ' electronic records to be breached , thieves also have tremendous incentives to get around protections because health records contain so much valuable information			1
privacy experts argue the health industry has been slow to respond to such incidents by adopting the encryption techniques used for years by financial companies			2
in the recent breach of @entity170 , a hospital chain based in @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity168 hackers bypassed the hospitals ' security systems and stole personal data , including names , @entity179 numbers and addresses of 4.5 million patients			0
@entity182 said it would offer identity theft protection to affected patients and carried cyber insurance to mitigate some of its losses			0
this video from the federal @entity191 department 's @entity189 explains some of the protections currently in place , as does as this fact sheet			0
the @entity195 offers this advice on preventing identity theft and protecting digital personal information			0
can emergency room doctors call up my electronic medical records if i 'm in an accident and unable to give them basic information ? probably not			1
a major criticism of electronic medical records in @entity14 is that the companies that make them have financial incentives to keep them from being easily shared			1
it 's kind of like @entity210 versus @entity212 operating systems			0
many companies are trying to win market share by creating software that does n't " talk " to those made by other companies , so if a big hospital uses software from company @entity222 , then all the doctors that work with that hospital will have an incentive to buy that software , too			0
if you 're unconscious and an ambulance takes you to a hospital you 've been to before , they can probably call up their records if you 're carrying some kind of identification			0
but they may not be able to access pertinent information stored on other doctors or hospitals ' computers			2
some states have good clearinghouses that allow health care providers to pull in all of a patient 's digital health files , but they 're still the exception at this point			1
@entity0 is an editorially independent program of the @entity0 .			0

at least some of the info you share with your doctor is probably stored on a computer
2009 economic stimulus package gave money to health care industry for tech upgrades
@entity75 does not require hospitals to use electronic medical records
