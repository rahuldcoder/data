-- a shortage of lethal injection chemicals has contributed to declining use of capital punishment in the @entity5 with a new report on thursday noting only 39 executions this year			1
it is only the second time in the past two decades the annual number of inmates put to death has dropped below 40			1
the total represents a 10 percent reduction from last year			1
no further executions are scheduled in 2013			1
" twenty years ago , use of the death penalty was increasing			0
now it is declining by almost every measure , " said @entity18 , executive director of the @entity20 , and the author of the report			0
" the recurrent problems of the death penalty have made its application rare , isolated , and often delayed for decades			0
more states will likely reconsider the wisdom of retaining this expensive and ineffectual practice			2
" the nonprofit organization provides accurate figures and a range of analysis , but opposes use of the death penalty			0
lethal injection in nine states while the annual number of executions and death sentences continues to drop nationally overall , it remains a legally and socially acceptable form of justice for aggravated murder in 32 states			1
but just nine states conducted lethal injections this year , and two -- @entity48 with 16 and @entity49 with 7 -- accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total			1
@entity48 is among the active death - penalty states scrambling to find new lethal injection protocols after @entity54 - based manufacturers banned @entity5 prisons from using their drugs in executions			1
among them is @entity60 - based @entity59 , which manufactures pentobarbital , the most commonly used -- either as a single drug , or in combination with others -- to execute prisoners			0
new drug combinations states have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies , according to an investigation last month by @entity0 's @entity72			2
a pending lawsuit against @entity48 filed by several death row inmates and their supporters alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital using an alias			1
until recently , most states relied on a three - drug " cocktail , " but many jurisdictions now use a single dose or a two - drug combination			2
various state and federal courts have postponed some planned executions until issues surrounding the new protocols are resolved			2
every execution this year relied on pentobarbital , except in @entity49 , which used midazolam hydrochloride -- a drug applied for the first time in human lethal injections			1
and @entity96 was prepared to inject a single dose of the anesthetic propofol for its two recent executions , until gov. @entity100 halted its application			2
the @entity102 had threatened to limit export of the widely used drug for other purposes if the state had proceeded			0
the two inmates were separately put to death in recent weeks using pentobarbital instead			2
first woman executed among the high - profile capital cases this year involved @entity112 , the first woman executed in the @entity5 in three years			1
the former @entity114 - area resident was convicted of murdering her neighbor , and in june became the state 's 500th prisoner to die at the hands of the government since 1976 , when the @entity120 allowed capital punishment to resume			1
so far , 1,359 people have been put to death across the country since that time , using lethal injection , electrocution , gas chamber , hanging , and firing squad			1
that includes three federal prisoners			0
spared for now was @entity132 inmate @entity131 , whose attorneys say he is mentally disabled			0
courts earlier this year stayed three separate execution dates , one with just minutes to spare			2
the @entity120 in march will hold oral arguments and decide whether the @entity49 scheme for identifying mentally disabled defendants in capital cases violates previous standards established by the high court			1
freddie @entity142 and an accomplice were convicted of the 1978 murders of a pregnant 21 - year - old woman and a sheriff 's deputy in separate store robberies , both on the same day			2
his lawyers say the death row inmate has an iq of 60			0
in @entity96 , @entity152 was freed in october and his sentence thrown out after the state high court found the trial prosecution withheld critical evidence that may have implicated another prisoner in a jailhouse murder			0
he became the 143rd person exonerated from death row in the past 40 years			0
@entity162 abolishes death penalty @entity162 became the sixth state in as many years to abolish its death penalty , joining @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , and @entity170			0
eighteen other states have previously done so			0
attorney general @entity172 faces a tough decision in coming months : whether to seek the death penalty in federal court for @entity177 bombing suspect @entity176			0
across the country , capital sentences remain at historic lows , with just 79 so far this year			1
they have declined in number by 75 percent from 1996 , said the report , when 315 people were put on death row			1
with the death penalty declining and recent polls showing a corresponding drop in public support , some legal analysts wonder if the @entity120 is prepared in coming years to take another look at the issue 's overall constitutionality -- whether capital punishment in the 21st century represents " cruel and unusual punishment			1
" no sign of @entity120 review the justices in most cases continue to deny most requests for stays of executions , usually without any comment , or a breakdown of which members of the nine - member bench might have granted such a delay			1
" it certainly seems that it merits another day in court after 40 years , " said @entity210 , a law professor at @entity211 , and author of the new book " a wild justice : the @entity217 and resurrection of @entity219 in @entity5			0
" " there are a lot of reasons to think that ( moderate - conservative ) justice @entity224 's vote is up for grabs and his mind is open on this question			0
so i do n't think the outcome of a case would be predetermined one way or another			0
" but there is no sign such a monumental legal and social review by the nation 's highest court will be coming soon .			0

shortage of lethal injection chemicals contributes to drop in capital punishment
the number of executions falls below 40 , off 10 percent from last year
nine states executed inmates in 2013 with @entity48 and @entity49 accounting for most
the @entity120 is not likely to address the issue any time soon
