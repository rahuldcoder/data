-- @entity2 's new video game console , the @entity1 , made its long - awaited debut last month			1
the real story here is n't about video games , though			0
a lot has changed in the seven years since the current @entity8 launched			0
gaming on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has exploded while traditional console gaming remains relatively stagnant			0
the challenge for any new video game console is to make it more than just a fancy computer that reads game discs			2
so how does the @entity1 try to differentiate itself ? @entity19			2
the @entity1 is designed to be the hub for all your living room entertainment , not just games			1
it can plug into your cable box and pipe live tv through your console using an hdmi cable , meaning you wo n't have to switch inputs			2
instead of seeing your cable company 's clunky on - screen menu system , you get a new guide designed by @entity2 that can can recommend shows and let you change the channel using your voice			1
@entity2 's demos of tv on the @entity1 were pretty impressive , too			1
you can seamlessly and instantaneously switch between a game , @entity41 movie or live cable tv without fiddling with a remote control			1
just say out loud what you want to watch , and the @entity1 will do the rest			2
there are also a few content deals with @entity47 and the @entity48 that let you manage your fantasy sports teams while watching games live			0
pretty cool , right ? unfortunately , the @entity1 wo n't work like magic for everyone , and it 's pretty clear that @entity2 has hit the same roadblocks @entity55 , @entity56 and others have when it comes to revolutionizing the way we watch tv			1
there are a lot of cable tv features the @entity1 wo n't be able to re-create , at least at first			1
you wo n't be able to watch on - demand shows			0
you wo n't be able to record shows to the @entity1 's hard drive			0
and it can directly integrate with your cable box only if you have a newer model with an hdmi cable , meaning many people will have to use an old - fashioned infrared sensor instead			0
fans air concerns about new playstation , @entity1 you 're still limited to watching whatever happens to be on live tv , which , unfortunately for @entity2 , is n't the only way people watch tv anymore			1
we 've been through this before			0
two years ago , @entity55 introduced @entity84 , which also adds a @entity86 - powered layer on top of cable			1
it was an interesting concept but one that has still failed to take off with the public			0
the service still relies on a regular cable box , and at its core , it 's just another fancy interface that tries to improve your regular on - screen menu			0
now for some good news			0
@entity2 still has the option to improve the @entity1 's tv features through software updates			1
after the console 's announcement last week , @entity1 hardware boss @entity102 told me it would be possible to allow the @entity1 to act as a dvr in a future update , just like other third - party @entity109 such as @entity111			2
in the end , though , the @entity1 , or any other video game console or streaming box like @entity114 or @entity115 , wo n't be able to truly change tv until it can clear a huge obstacle : persuading major cable companies to ditch their set - top boxes and use theirs instead			1
