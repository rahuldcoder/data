-- no amount of economic growth will land you a job if you get unfairly snagged in the @entity6 's faulty background check system			1
and you can lose your job because of the @entity6 file inaccuracies , too			2
after working without incident at a @entity12 port for 33 years , @entity9 was told he was out of a job when a newly required post- 9/11 security clearance check found an arrest dating back to 1971			0
charges were never filed , and @entity9 was never prosecuted			0
but the nearly 40 - year - old arrest was reported on his @entity6 background check with no additional information , and @entity9 needed months to track down documentation to prove he had never been convicted or even charged with a crime			1
only then could he regain his job			0
a @entity24 report found the @entity6 ran a record 16.9 million employment background checks -- a six-fold increase from a decade ago -- for jobs ranging from child care to truck driving , port workers to mortgage processors			1
although background checks can contribute to workplace safety , inaccuracies in the @entity6 database mean that these checks are blocking about 600,000 @entity37 a year from jobs for which they may be perfectly qualified			1
this unfair barrier to employment can and must be fixed			0
the glitch is that @entity6 records often fail to report the final outcomes of arrests			2
the case might have been dismissed or the charges reduced , but a prospective employer might not know it from the @entity6 background check			1
roughly one - third of all felony arrests do n't result in conviction , according to the @entity51 , and many more are reduced to misdemeanors			0
by the @entity55 's own count , roughly 50 % of @entity6 background records are incomplete and do n't include the final outcome of an arrest			1
in the face of such errors , only a fraction of job seekers successfully correct their @entity6 records -- and then only with great effort and expense			2
those unable to correct their reports are often trapped in a cycle of poverty that @entity70 attorney general @entity69 decried in a recent speech			0
@entity72 , a nurse 's aide in @entity74 , @entity75 , with nearly a decade of experience , was fired when an @entity6 background check inaccurately reported a youthful conviction that had been dismissed and sealed			1
@entity72 was fired and unable to find employment while she struggled -- for four years -- to clear her record			2
during that time , she exhausted her unemployment benefits , relied on food assistance to feed her children , lost a family vehicle and was forced to short sale her home after entering foreclosure			0
now re-employed , @entity72 will have to spend years digging out of the financial hole that the @entity6 's inaccuracies left her in			1
the burden of these errors comes with sharp racial disparities			0
just as @entity37 and @entity94 are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system , so are they disproportionately harmed when records are incomplete			1
denying employment based on faulty records puts more @entity37 and @entity94 out of work for longer while they struggle to clear their name			2
what can be done ? the @entity6 , which gathers records from the states , must provide accurate and up - to - date information when potential employers come asking for them			1
a successful and well - established federal precedent for this exists in the @entity108 , the federal program for firearm background checks			1
under the @entity108 , when the @entity6 receives background check requests for gun purchases , it contacts the appropriate federal , state and local agencies to get any missing disposition information and is able to clean up two - thirds of faulty records within just three days of the request			1
the system is quick , efficient and accurate			0
if a similar system were applied to employment background checks , we estimate that 390,000 workers a year would be assisted -- able to get a job -- because of the timely , accurate information			1
employers and licensing agencies would benefit from clean records , too			0
rep. @entity129 , @entity130 , introduced a bill to clean up incomplete @entity6 background checks for employment			1
rep. @entity134 , @entity135 , has also introduced the @entity137 bill , specifically focusing on federal employment			0
these bills are coming not a moment too soon			0
in addition to these critical legislative fixes , the @entity6 can do a lot immediately to address this problem , including accepting updated records from fellow federal and state agencies			2
the seal of the @entity6 is intended to mark these records as official , legitimate and trustworthy			0
until they are made so , the records pose an unacceptable barrier to employment for thousands of @entity37			2
that 's something our economy and our workers can not afford			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

@entity159 : employers use @entity6 background checks , but half the information is wrong
she says 600,000 are turned away from potential jobs because database is n't updated
*neighly* : an old arrest record can get workers fired , even if they were never charged
system must be updated , she says ; it 's an *injustice* to thousands of @entity37
