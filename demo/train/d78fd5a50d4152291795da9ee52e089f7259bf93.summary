@entity0 -- @entity3 host @entity2 chastised her guests for being too serious just before the controversial segment about former @entity8 presidential nominee @entity7 's adopted black grandson			1
a source who was in the studio during the show told @entity1 that before the offending segment , the comedians were urged off the air to be funnier			0
the source asked not to be identified			0
later in the show , @entity16 told viewers the panel of comedians would " be forced to drink during the commercial so they can get their funny back			1
" @entity16 would tearfully apologize for the jokes a week later			1
" my intention was not malicious , but i broke the ground rule that families are off limits , and for that i am sorry , " @entity16 said saturday			1
the apology comes weeks after @entity3 host @entity29 lost his job because of remarks about former @entity8 vice presidential nominee @entity32			1
controversial comments by journalists about an @entity37 politician 's family are not new			2
@entity38 threatened physical violence against a @entity41 critic who famously wrote in 1950 that the president 's daughter " can not sing very well			1
" while @entity45 put herself into the public eye with her performance , @entity7 's grandson @entity44 only sat on his grandfather 's lap for a family christmas card photograph			1
and this instance involved race			0
ridiculing transracial adoption ? @entity16 asked her panelists to come up with captions for the photo of @entity7 , his wife and their 21 grandchildren , all white except for @entity44			1
comedic actress @entity61 sang a @entity63 song : " one of @entity64			0
" comedian @entity66 joked that the photo " really sums up the diversity of the @entity8			0
" @entity16 described the baby as " gorgeous " and suggested @entity44 could someday marry @entity70 , the daughter of @entity72 and @entity73			1
" can you imagine @entity7 and @entity72 as in - laws ? " she joked			1
unlike @entity38 and the critic , @entity7 quickly forgave @entity16			1
" people make mistakes , and the folks at @entity3 made a big mistake and they apologized for it , " @entity7 said in an interview on " @entity78			1
" " they apologized for it			2
that 's all we can ask for			2
" @entity88 political columnist @entity87 , a guest sunday on @entity1 's " @entity89 , " blamed the growing competitiveness and immediacy of media today for the increase in such incidents			2
" there 's always this incentive to say something that 's newsworthy , attention - getting , but it 's real easy to cross the line into offensive and stupid , " @entity87 said			2
" and that 's a split - second judgment sometimes			2
" the punch lines drew fire from critics who said they disrespected transracial adoptions , which the @entity106 says make up 40 % of all adoptions in the @entity37			0
" allow me to apologize to other families formed through transracial adoption because i am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families are in any way funny or deserving of ridicule , " @entity16 said in her saturday apology			1
@entity7 accepts @entity3 host 's apology @entity16 , who is a political science professor at @entity118 , was surrounded by four comedians and no professional journalists			1
the live , unscripted show , which she said was her second annual " @entity125 " edition , seemed more like a night at the improv than a cable news program			0
" this is the show where we dispense with the serious and sober coverage of the year in politics , " she promised viewers			0
they would look back on " some of the political absurdity of 2013 with the ridicule and mockery it so rightly deserves			0
" @entity16 delivered an opening monologue loaded with obvious sexual puns about the @entity138 sexting scandal			1
comedian @entity139 joked about sen. @entity140 , saying it was scary that the @entity142 @entity8 had daughters			0
other comments came about the daughters of " rich , white @entity8			0
" the mandate for more punch lines was made clear by @entity16 after one somewhat serious segment			1
opinion : lesson of the @entity7 adoption joke story " my comedians are all going to be forced to drink during the commercial so they can get their funny back because they 've got real serious about sexism and feminism , " the host said			1
" we are basically ratings whores , " @entity16 added			2
@entity160 media reporter @entity159 said the @entity3 brand has been damaged by these controversies , considering the channel was " supposed to elevate the discourse " with smart , well - educated progressives who " lean forward			2
" " it 's leaning backward and it 's totally , it 's not what @entity3 , i think , was supposed to be about originally , and i think it 's doing real , severe damage to the brand , " @entity159 said on @entity1 's " @entity89			1
" @entity170 radio host @entity169 told " @entity89 " that @entity16 's brand has been damaged by the controversy as well			1
" her brand is to exactly be on top of the kind of ignorant and other kind of racist commentary			0
" blurry ground rules the @entity179 has a code of ethics that says journalists should " use special sensitivity when dealing with children " and " show good taste			0
" students learn it in most journalism schools			0
but the rule book in the rough - and - tumble world of politics and media is an unwritten common law of precedents that evolves partly through apologies , resignations and firings			2
@entity16 's apology makes one rule clear : the kids are off limits			1
there are exceptions to the rule , such as when politicians decide to use family members to win support			0
the campaign of @entity210 's new mayor , @entity209 , prominently featured his biracial family in commercials and campaign events			0
teenage son @entity214 appeared in his own ad highlighting his father 's stance against " stop - and - frisk			0
" @entity214 and his @entity220 - style hair became a social media sensation and is credited with helping his father surge to the top of the polls last year			0
" his family , just because of the racial mix , represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities , " said @entity225 , a veteran @entity226 operative who advised the campaign and has known de @entity209 for two decades			0
" the family is very important to @entity209			0
... from the outside , this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government			0
" opinion : why @entity7 adoption jokes hurt			2

" my intention was not malicious , " @entity3 hosts tearfully says
" the folks at @entity3 made a big mistake and they apologized for it , " @entity7 says
@entity38 once threatened a critic who wrote his daughter " can not sing very well "
