-- @entity1 faced another day of relentless cross-examination friday as the prosecution challenged his account of the killing of his girlfriend , @entity6			1
prosecutor @entity7 has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of @entity6 , whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his home in @entity14 , @entity15			1
his questions again sought to undermine @entity1 ' reliability and credibility and to portray the @entity20 athlete as someone who was inventing his version of events and " tailoring " evidence to suit his story			1
as @entity27 turned once again to the early hours of @entity28 2013 , he repeatedly challenged @entity1 over his actions in the moments leading up to @entity6 's death			1
the prosecution 's argument is that @entity1 shot @entity6 intentionally after a heated argument			1
@entity1 does not deny shooting her but insists that he mistook her for an intruder			1
@entity1 said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired			1
" i did n't intend to shoot			0
my firearm was pointed at the door because that 's where i believed that somebody was , " he said			2
" when i heard a noise , i did n't have to think , and i fired -- i fired my weapon			1
" @entity27 , known in @entity15 legal circles for his bulldog - like approach to cross-examination , responded to @entity1 ' testimony almost with scorn			2
" your version is so improbable that nobody would ever think that it was reasonably , possibly true , " he said			0
@entity27 then hammered @entity1 on whether he had known @entity6 was in the toilet when he fired			1
" you knew @entity6 was behind the door , and you shot at her , " @entity27 said more than once			1
" that 's not true , " @entity1 replied in a low tone			1
that dramatic moment was when @entity27 asked for the trial to be adjourned until monday morning			2
prosecutor : you wanted to shoot @entity1 earlier denied being " ready to shoot " as he made his way to the bathroom where he says he heard what he thought was an intruder			1
but he agreed that he had taken off the safety catch so he could fire if needed			0
" i did n't want to take anybody 's life			2
i screamed for the intruders to get out of my home , " he said			0
" you wanted to shoot , " contended @entity27 , who on thursday sought to build a picture of @entity1 as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns			2
@entity1 replied that there is a " massive difference " between being ready for something and wanting to do it			2
asked by the prosecutor why he approached the apparent threat rather than seeking to move out of harm 's way , the athlete said it was his in his nature to respond that way			2
" i wanted to put myself between the perceived danger and @entity6 , " he said			2
" i wish i did all these other things put to me			0
" @entity27 also argued that it was " not possible " that @entity6 would not have responded when @entity1 screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house , as he has said happened			1
@entity6 was only 3 meters from @entity1 at the time , behind the toilet door , the prosecutor said			1
" she would 've been terrified , but i do n't think that would 've led her to call out , " @entity1 said , arguing that @entity6 would have assumed the danger was getting closer			1
" she was n't scared of anything except you			0
she was n't scared of an intruder			0
she was scared of you , " replied @entity27			0
the prosecutor also pressed @entity1 over whether he heard a woman screaming during the shots he fired , as some witnesses have said they heard			1
@entity1 said he did not			2
@entity1 : i was fixated on the threat as @entity27 went through the events leading up to the point of the shooting , @entity1 said that after getting up to close a balcony door and move fans inside , he heard the bathroom window sliding open and slamming into the frame			1
@entity27 repeatedly asked him why he had n't at that point asked @entity6 whether she too had heard the noise			1
@entity1 replied that he did n't because he was sure about what he had heard			1
he said he whispered to @entity6 to get down and call police			2
@entity27 asked whether he had waited for a response , as he said would have been reasonable , pointing out that his ex-girlfriend @entity118 had testified he had done that on a previous occasion when he 'd heard a noise			2
" i never waited for a response			0
... my whole body was fixated on the threat , " @entity1 answered			2
@entity27 's questions then focused on the position of certain items in the bedroom , including a duvet , the fans and a pair of jeans , all of which @entity1 says were moved by police			1
@entity27 sought to argue that they do not support @entity1 ' version of events			2
at one point , the judge reprimanded @entity27 for calling @entity1 a liar and told him to mind his language			2
more than once , @entity27 suggested that @entity1 had difficulty remembering what happened because he had made things up			2
@entity1 became emotional as the cross-examination continued , prompting @entity27 to ask him why			0
" this is the night i lost the person that i cared about			0
i do n't know why people do n't understand that , " @entity1 responded			1
as he broke down in tears , the judge ordered a short break to allow him time to gather himself			0
@entity27 has previously accused @entity1 of becoming emotional when the questions get difficult			1
@entity1 quizzed about mistakes during cross-examination earlier friday , @entity1 made mistakes in answering questions about repair work and his alarm system			1
he attributed the mistakes to fatigue , prompting @entity27 to ask whether he was too tired to continue in the stand			0
@entity1 , becoming emotional , replied , " i do n't need time			1
i am tired ; that 's not going to change			0
" " with respect , mr. @entity1 , i 'm not convinced			0
... i think you 're trying to cover up for lies , " @entity27 said			0
after judge @entity169 pressed @entity1 on the question , the athlete said he was n't making mistakes because he was tired -- prompting @entity27 to ask why , in that case , he was making mistakes			1
a little later , @entity27 made a mistake while questioning @entity1 , who pointed it out			0
the prosecutor said @entity1 was n't too tired to highlight the mistakes the prosecutor himself was making in his questioning			1
@entity27 also focused on security on the gated @entity182 estate where @entity1 lived , pointing out that despite his claimed fear of burglary , the athlete left his cars outside and had not immediately fixed a broken window in his house			0
@entity1 ' message exchanges with @entity6 a day earlier , the athlete denied that he acted selfishly toward @entity6			1
in a bid to paint their relationship as rocky , he ripped apart message exchanges between the couple thursday			0
@entity27 also sought to paint him as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend 's declaration of love			0
but @entity1 said he preferred to talk to his girlfriend over the phone rather than messaging			1
he acknowledged he never got a chance to tell her that he loved her			0
" because it was all about mr. @entity1 , " @entity27 said			0
the runner has admitted to the killing but said he mistook @entity6 for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the toilet door and killed her			1
the prosecution alleges that @entity1 killed his girlfriend after they argued			1
several witnesses have testified to hearing a man 's shouts coming from the house , although they have also spoken of the terrified screams of a woman leading up to and during a volley of shots			0
the trial has gripped @entity15 , where @entity1 is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity			0
his disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby , but he went on to achieve global fame as the " @entity1 , " winning numerous @entity224 gold medals on the steel blades fitted to his prostheses			0
only those in the courtroom can see @entity1 because he has chosen not to testify on camera			0
his testimony can be heard on an audio feed			0
the trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of may			0
@entity169 will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors			0
@entity15 does not have jury trials			0
@entity0 's @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 denies knowing that @entity6 was behind door when he fired
the court is adjourned until monday at the prosecutor 's request
prosecutor @entity7 questions why @entity1 did n't ask his girlfriend about noise
the prosecution is trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt @entity1 killed her intentionally
