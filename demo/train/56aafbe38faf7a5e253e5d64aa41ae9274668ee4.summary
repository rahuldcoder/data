congressional republicans are vowing to fight president @entity2 's plan to make immigration changes through executive action , but they are struggling with how to do that without triggering another government shutdown			1
the @entity7 and @entity8 need to pass a measure during the lame duck session to fund federal agencies , which will run out of money in mid-december			2
@entity7 conservatives are pressing speaker @entity14 to attach language to the spending bill that would block any money for federal agencies to give out any new visas or green cards			1
but @entity22 chairman @entity21 , @entity23 , who is crafting a yearlong so - called " omnibus " spending measure , warned that effort could trigger a shutdown , and insisted no one wants to go down that road			0
" there 's no one stronger than me against unilateral action by the president on this subject , however it 's been said before - do n't take a hostage you ca n't shoot , " @entity21 told reporters after a meeting with all @entity7 @entity33 on thursday			1
the debate over how to confront @entity2 is posing a sudden challenge for @entity33 leaders fresh off their victories during last week 's midterm elections , which gave them control of both chambers of @entity48 for the first time in nearly a decade			1
a day after the election , @entity49 , who will become @entity8 majority leader in january , said @entity33 would take positions @entity2 would n't like but pledged not to shut down the government			1
@entity2 , who is traveling in @entity54 this week , has said he remains committed to using his executive authority to address immigration by the end of the year but the precise timing is n't clear			1
@entity7 press secretary @entity59 told reporters in @entity61 that @entity2 is " nearing a final decision			1
" @entity14 told members at thursday meeting that one of his top priorities is to use every tool available to him to stop any effort by the president to go around @entity48 on immigration , according to several republicans who attended			1
but the speaker also said he does n't want a shutdown , and he cautioned members that they need to game out a smart way to respond before they move forward with a vote			0
at an afternoon press conference , @entity14 pledged to " fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path			0
" he said no decisions were made and @entity33 leaders were considering various ways to block the action , but did not rule out waging the fight on the spending bill			1
" all options are on the table , " he said			0
@entity91 @entity90 rep. @entity90 , who drafted a letter signed by more than 50 house @entity33 members to @entity21 , told reporters he 's not pushing for a shutdown , but leaders should n't rule out any options			1
" it 's really tragic that before we even fight a fight , or even stake a claim that we 're throwing in the towel			0
i just do n't think that 's the way to operate			0
we do n't have to talk about ultimatum scenarios at this point in time , " @entity90 told reporters after the meeting			0
@entity90 argued that after the midterm elections @entity33 have a mandate to push back at the president , and they should use their legislative authority to curb his executive actions			0
senate majority leader @entity115 supports @entity2 's effort to address immigration but has privately conveyed concerns to the @entity7 that an executive action could threaten passage of the spending bill			1
" the president has said he 'll do the executive action , the question is when , " @entity115 told @entity125 in a hallway interview in the @entity127			2
" he can do it , you know , it 's up to him			0
but i 'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it			0
but it 's up to him			0
" several @entity33 told @entity125 the memory of last year 's shutdown and the damage it inflicted on the @entity33 brand is fresh enough that members are willing to give the speaker some time to decide what approach to take			2
a vote on a spending bill is not expected on the @entity7 floor until early december			0
what 's complicating the next move for @entity14 and other congressional @entity33 leaders is no one knows the details yet on the timing or scope of what the president will do			1
even if @entity7 @entity33 have the votes to pass something as part of a spending bill , any measure that blocks the president from using his own authority will be blocked in the @entity8 , which is still controlled by @entity164 , or vetoed by the president			2
that leaves the clock ticking before the government runs out of money on december 11th			0
one option @entity33 leaders are considering is passing a short term spending bill - one lasting a few weeks even - that would avoid a shutdown and give them more time to decide how to respond to the president after he rolls out his plan , which is expected by the end of the year			2
another is to expand the lawsuit against president @entity2 that @entity7 @entity33 already approved to challenge his authority to implement @entity181			1
although the @entity7 voted to sue the president in july , the formal legal paperwork has n't been filed with the courts yet			2
whether leaders decide to challenge the president as part of a spending bill or later , it 's clear that conservatives are bracing for a major confrontation with the president over his plans to allow potentially millions of undocumented workers to remain in the @entity194 " i trust him completely to do the worst left wing , twisted policy that he can come up with " @entity91 @entity200 rep. @entity200 told @entity125 .			0
