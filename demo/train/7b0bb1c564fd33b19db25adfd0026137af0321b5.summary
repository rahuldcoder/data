@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the backroom of a small house in @entity0 in southeastern @entity1 , a handful of women are fighting to keep an ancient craft alive			1
their dexterous fingers race up and down large wooden looms , weaving the bold geometric patterns distinct to @entity0 carpets			1
once celebrated throughout @entity13 for their beauty , @entity0 carpets graced the walls and floors of @entity18 royal palaces , as well homes of the urban elite			1
weaved for over four centuries in the town after which they were named -- @entity0 , once a thriving trade center on the caravan route between east and west -- they were ceremonially rolled out for state visits , and given to foreign dignitaries			1
however , what was a thriving craft practiced by 5,000 weavers a century ago is now under threat of extinction , with only 10 women still keeping the tradition going			1
" @entity0 carpet weaving is our treasure which is passed on from generation to generation			1
it 's the knowledge i learned from my mother and my grandmother , " says @entity39 who founded the @entity42 's @entity41 cooperative in @entity0 with local women in 2009 , to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion			1
" @entity51 weaving is in our dna , " she continues			0
" we were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with @entity0 carpets			1
" mastery of craft @entity0 carpets are very thin but extremely dense , and are said to last more than a century			1
they have two identical sides and are geographically protected , which means that they can only be made in the @entity0 area , and out of @entity0 sheep -- a rare breed with only a few flocks counting just 250 sheep remaining			1
it requires geometrical precision , supreme skill and creativity in equal measure			0
everything is done by hand only , and in the same way as hundreds of years ago			2
it takes two weavers working simultaneously a month to create less than one square meter			2
traditionally a female activity , young girls would start at the loom at the age of 10 , practicing every day for five years to reach a level considered good enough			2
their weaving skill had a great impact on their marriage prospects -- it was considered a measure of intelligence because of the knowledge of mathematics required to calculate the size and distribution of patterns			2
" when you look at a carpet with an untrained eye , you can see beautiful colorful patterns , but we work out exactly how many of these patterns we can fit within a meter , " says @entity39			2
" we have to be visionaries and use logic to see where these patterns will stop , and where the border of the carpet will connect and finish , " she adds			0
and if a weaver makes a mistake , the carpet is instantly pulled apart , even if the work was nearly completed			0
magical meaning the concentration necessary for this kind of precise work often means that once a weaver sits down at the loom , she loses all sense of time			0
" the pattern in a mysterious way simply possesses her , drags her into the depth and she 's so taken by her work that everything around her stops			0
she forgets about the time , she surrenders herself to the pattern , " says @entity39			0
and it 's those patterns that give @entity0 carpets a mystical allure			1
weavers say they represent ancient symbols which carry magical meanings and can be read as an image alphabet , and there are 95 varieties which weavers have to memorize			1
" it is very mysterious but in every single carpet there is a story which you can read			0
when i see a carpet i can immediately tell whether it has been made now or in a different period , whether it has been made with love or only to be sold , " says @entity39			0
even though this skill is now practiced only by a handful of women , @entity39 and her fellow weavers from @entity42 's @entity41 are trying to pass it on to the next generation , organizing winter courses for schoolchildren , including boys			0
" there is a new generation coming along and if we manage to pass on this knowledge to them , i think there wo n't be any danger of this craft dying out , " says @entity39			0
" we are the guardians of the tradition of @entity0 carpet weaving , and we do this with love			2
" read this : resilient @entity168 rebuilds once again read this : no battery ? use a ' @entity171 ! ' more from @entity172 @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
