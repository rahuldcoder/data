@entity0 -- @entity2 was once feted as one of the rising stars of the @entity6 media : she was the youngest person ever to edit a national @entity6 newspaper , and made a stellar rise through the ranks of @entity11 's media empire			1
she held the top job at @entity13 , @entity14 's @entity6 subsidiary , for two years after editing the country 's best - selling daily tabloid , @entity17 , and its best - selling sunday tabloid , @entity18			1
but following allegations of illegal eavesdropping by @entity18 journalists when she was editor , she saw her fortunes fade			0

as politicians became engulfed in the scandal , with allegations that ministers acted improperly in their dealings with @entity14 , prime minister @entity45 -- a family friend of @entity23 ' husband -- admitted he had ridden the horse			2

before she took the stand in february 2014 , the defense reminded the jury that @entity23 was not on trial " because she was the editor of a tabloid newspaper " or for working for media baron @entity11 or for " any political views she may hold " or for " the support newspapers she edited gave to one party or another			1
" rather , the defense said , her trial hinged on whether she knew about and endorsed a " practice of phone hacking at @entity18 during her editorship " ; whether she had encouraged a @entity17 reporter to pay a public official ; and whether she had asked her husband , @entity23 , and her personal assistant , @entity98 , to " get rid of things ... to cover up the practice of phone hacking or of paying public officials			1
" @entity23 denied any wrongdoing			2

he went on to be @entity45 's director of communications , resigning from his role with the prime minister in 2011 , when police launched a second investigation into newspaper eavesdropping			0
when @entity111 gave evidence in april - with his wife watching from the public gallery - he said the affair " should n't have happened , " the @entity138 and @entity117 newspaper reported			0
but he denied that it meant he and @entity23 had shared sensitive stories , the outlets said			0
the revelations were seized on by @entity6 media covering the case , with one newspaper - @entity148 -- headlining its story " the affair they did n't expose , " a reference to the tabloid newspapers ' history of revealing other people 's cheating			1
in june , @entity111 was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones			0

as part of the controversial campaign , which was inspired by the murder of eight - year - old @entity211 in july 2000 , @entity23 took the decision to name and shame offenders in the pages of her paper			1
the lists sparked witch - hunts and riots , as communities across @entity6 tried to hound pedophiles out of their neighborhoods			2
it was condemned by police , but @entity23 remains unrepentant			0
