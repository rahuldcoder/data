@entity1 's ongoing enchantment with politics continues with yet another political tv show ; @entity5 ' upcoming " madam secretary			1
" the show tested the @entity8 waters thursday night with @entity10 's media and political elites at a screening at the spacious @entity13 , aptly situated across the street from the real @entity15			1
" no , this show has nothing to do with @entity20 or @entity21 or @entity22 or anybody else we know , " said actor @entity16 on the @entity18 red carpet			1
we made it all up and we will continue to make it up			0
" @entity16 's production studio @entity30 is spearheading the project			2
they might be making it up , but they clearly borrowed a little inspiration from real - life current events			0
in the premier episode , @entity38 as a political flashpoint , social media sabotaging negotiation efforts , the 24 - hour news cycle eating away at every staged move , women 's roles in leadership , and the inability for " madam secretary " to " have it all			1
" there 's also the requisite mix of sex and comedic relief in typical @entity1 ( and @entity8 ) fashion			1
former madam secretary @entity54 attended the premiere , sitting next to @entity5 ' @entity56 who made a cameo in the premiere episode			1
@entity60 's @entity59 , @entity62 's @entity61 , @entity64 's @entity63 , and @entity20 's right - hand woman @entity65 were all in attendance			2
there have been two women secretaries of state since @entity54 served under president @entity70 -- @entity71 and @entity20 -- which means women have made strides with leading roles in two male dominated industries -- politics and tv			2
there has been a surge in female - centered shows about the nation 's capitol			1
think " scandal , " " homeland " and " @entity85			0
" leading lady @entity88 looked every bit the part of her on - air persona of madam secretary in a slim blazer - pants combo that put other pant suits in the crowd to shame as she fielded questions and picture requests			2
actor @entity98 , who plays @entity88 's comedic lap - dog assistant on the show , weighed in on the @entity102 obsession with @entity8 " it 's already addicting			1
before it was on television portrayed fictionally , we were all news junkies , we were all interested in what was going on			0
i think it 's naturally drama -- it 's like a hospital , it 's like a law firm , anything that has natural drama built in			2
" we all think we know the @entity119 government , we all think we know how it works			0
we all think we know what happens			0
we obviously do n't , so this sort of gives us fulfills our need to see what 's going on inside there			0
" the premise and especially the premiere episode follow the formula set forth by other television dramas like " homeland " : two young men are being dragged through a dank prison , a cacophony of @entity134 filling the air			0
cut to the lofty campus of @entity137 , where protagonist @entity138 leads a leisurely life as a professor			0
jump to an untimely demise of the secretary of state that thrusts her into the national spotlight after the president personally begs her to fill the role			1
the show takes off from there , navigating the hallowed halls of @entity151 and the @entity15 .			0
