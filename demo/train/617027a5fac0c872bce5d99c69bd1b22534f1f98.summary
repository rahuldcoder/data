@entity0 -- last month , an independent film titled " i want to be an astronaut " about a driven high school robotics student and his dream to become an astronaut premiered aboard the @entity7 286 miles above the @entity8			1
the film 's concept was originally hatched in 2011 when its creator , @entity12 , caught astrophysicist @entity13 on " @entity14 with @entity15 " late one night			2
@entity15 's panel was comparing cuts in @entity19 's budget to the $ 700 billion used to bail out @entity20 in 2008			1
determined to shine a light on the importance of @entity23 ( science , technology , engineering , and math ) programs , @entity12 set out to make a film for his master 's thesis about high school robotics programs			2
@entity12 's film examines the state of @entity36 's space program and captures the passion for human space travel as well as the somber tone that followed the retirement of the @entity41 in 2011			1
according to various sources , @entity19 issued layoff notices to about 3,200 contractors after the shuttle @entity45 and its crew of four astronauts landed at @entity19 's @entity48 on july 21 , 2011 , the final mission after a 30 - year career			1
but the film really took shape when @entity12 met @entity53 , then a 17 - year - old high school senior keenly interested in space travel			1
@entity53 , who is now 19 , had wanted to be an astronaut since he was 3 years old			0
the film follows him as he leads his first ( @entity58 ) robotics team in a competition and looks to the @entity61 for college			0
the @entity63 ( @entity64 ) has been supporting participation in @entity66 by providing grants to high school teams as well as sponsoring first regional competitions			0
@entity53 set his sights on the @entity61 because it has graduated more astronauts than any other @entity36 institution			0
now a midshipmen earning academic honors , @entity53 is majoring in aerospace engineering and computer science with the hope of attending flight school			0
@entity53 , who is not permitted by the @entity61 to speak to the media , acknowledges in the movie that becoming an astronaut is , " a long and complicated process , and i do n't know what i 'm going to encounter along the way , but i do n't think i 'll ever lose that dream			2
" @entity86 , astronaut and chief of @entity19 's @entity88 , who is shown in the film as a mentor to @entity53 's @entity91 , said these programs are similar in many ways to how @entity19 designed , built and tested the @entity19 @entity94 , which is currently exploring the @entity95			1
" @entity19 always looks forward to seeing how students ' innovative solutions are developed and seeing how their creativity might help inspire development of future spacecraft systems , " @entity86 said			1
@entity101 , @entity53 's brother who is now a junior in high school , also caught the robotics bug			0
" i joined first robotics for ( several ) reasons : i have always loved to build things and see them work , and i saw how happy it made my brother and how much it challenged him , " he said			0
" the robotics team gave me a great idea of what engineering is and has made me want to pursue it as a career			0
" while the shuttle program has been retired , the @entity36 is still involved in space exploration with various robotic missions , private enterprise and international efforts			0
according to @entity19 , " @entity19 is committed to human spaceflight beyond low - earth orbit and the continued development of its next generation spacecraft -- @entity125			1
the @entity125 spacecraft will take astronauts beyond low @entity128 ( @entity129 ) to deep space			0
it will provide emergency abort capability , sustain the crew during space travel and provide safe reentry from deep space			1
the spacecraft will launch on exploration flight test - 1 , an uncrewed mission planned for 2014			0
" so what does this mean for kids who dream of traveling in space ? @entity143 , director of @entity144 at @entity145 ( an association that represents aerospace and defense manufacturers ) said there are plenty of opportunities			2
" i 'm excited for @entity19 's future and i 'm looking forward to the agency 's completion of numerous programs that will be brought online in just a few short years , " he said			1
" between the commercial crew program , the @entity125 , and the @entity156 , more vehicles are being built for human spaceflight right now ( 2014 ) than at any other point in our history , if ( the nation ) maintains steady support for these programs			2
" @entity12 and his team passionately hope the film will " draw attention to the importance of the @entity23 education as it relates to our nation 's ability to remain on the cutting edge of science and technology to create jobs of the future			1
" @entity12 personally believes , " we need a vibrant space program to provide the context needed for young people to pursue these challenging and exciting career fields			2
" according to @entity19 and @entity183 , the 2014 @entity19 budget is $ 17.7 billion dollars , the same as 2013 and a .3 % decrease from 2012			2
that translates to a $ 50 million cut from 2012 funding			0
@entity12 's film is slated to be screened in may at the @entity189 in @entity190 that will host speakers @entity191 -- the @entity194 astronaut who was the second man on the moon , @entity193 , ceo of @entity196 , and @entity197 , president and @entity199 the film will also be presented at the @entity203 's 60th @entity202 celebration on july 16 at the @entity204 in @entity0			1
most recently , @entity12 and his film were invited to the @entity206 to @entity207 2014 at @entity208			0
the film is scheduled to open discussions on how humanity can land on @entity95 by the 2030s			0
as @entity12 said in a recent interview , " our goal with this film is to remind everyone what @entity19 means to the world , reignite those dreams again , and explore space together			1
