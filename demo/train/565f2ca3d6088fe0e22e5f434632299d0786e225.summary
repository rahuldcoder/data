-- the @entity2 senate has passed a bill banning same - sex marriages , defying a threat from @entity6 to withhold aid from nations violating gay rights			1
the bill by @entity12 's most populous nation calls for a 14 - year sentence for anyone convicted of homosexuality			1
anyone who aids or " abets " same - sex unions faces 10 years in prison , a provision that could target rights groups			1
it goes to the nation 's @entity23 for a vote before president @entity26 can sign it into law			1
" it would place a wide range of people at risk of criminal sanctions , including human rights defenders and anyone else -- including friends , families and colleagues -- who stands up for the rights of lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender people in @entity2 , " @entity29 said in a statement			2
the bill passed tuesday comes nearly a month after @entity6 prime minister , @entity46 , threatened to withhold aid from nations violating gays rights , sparking outrage in @entity12 where leaders interpreted it as " colonial " display of power			1
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity57 countries based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the @entity6 colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs			1
punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison			1
" this is something we raise continually and ... we 're also saying that @entity6 aid should have more strings attached in terms of ' do you persecute people for their faith or their @entity74 or do you persecute people for their sexuality ? " @entity46 said in a statement			2
" we do n't think that 's acceptable			2
so look , this is an issue where we want movement , we 're pushing for movement , we 're prepared to put some money behind what we believe			2
" soon after his remarks earlier this month , a flurry of @entity57 governments released defiant statements accusing him of undermining their sovereignty and culture			1
last week , @entity94 president @entity93 , known for his anti-gay rhetoric , called the prime minister " satanic " for demanding gay rights			1
" do not get tempted into that ( homosexuality ) madness			1
if you go that direction , we will punish you severely , " state media quoted him as saying			2
" it is condemned by nature			2
it is condemned by insects and that is why i have said they are worse than pigs and dogs			2
" @entity93 's comments were the latest in a series of strident remarks by @entity57 leaders			1
@entity118 government spokesman @entity117 described @entity46 's remarks as " patronizing , colonial rhetoric , " saying the nation is busy expanding its oil sector to reduce its reliance on aid			1
" we are working hard to limit our reliance on foreign governments for this reason , " he said			2
" statements like the one @entity46 is making are false			2
our cultural norms and values do n't accept homosexuality , but there is no policy against gay people			1
" in 2009 , a @entity118 lawmaker introduced a proposal calling for execution of people convicted of homosexuality			1
the proposal sparked an international outcry and threats from some @entity143 countries to cut aid to the nation , which relies on millions of dollars from foreign nations			1
@entity117 said the proposal was the opinion of a sole lawmaker and did not reflect the government view			2
the legislation was eventually shelved , but regularly pops up in parliament and remains a simmering issue			2
@entity153 president @entity152 , a major western ally , applauded the benefits of foreign aid , but said the nation will not accept money that will undermine its interest			1
" i will never initiate or support any attempt to legalize homosexuality in @entity153 , " he told journalists this month , according to state media			2
" as government we will abide by the principles as contained in our @entity166 , which is supreme			0
" @entity168 officials decried the remarks , saying they " can lead to broken relations " between the two nations			0
@entity46 's statements also sparked a fiery debate among @entity57 on social media , where opinions were divided			1
" at first , i was upset			0
i thought , how dare he treats us like this ? ' said @entity179 , 33 , who lives in @entity180 , @entity94			1
" then i thought about it , " the businessman said			0
" the @entity6 economy is struggling			0
they spend a lot of money on aid			0
given what 's happening economically			0
maybe it 's a nice way of saying -- we ca n't afford it ? " @entity179 said the threat should be an opportunity to open up a dialogue on an issue considered a taboo in @entity57 culture			1
" now is the time to talk about it ... to get our house in order			0
lets use this opportunity to say , ' ok , if we did n't have aid , how would we survive ? " he said			0
" let 's talk about gay rights issues			0
let 's turn this into a national -- @entity57 discussion			1
" others said while denying aid would be extreme , the continent has a long way to go when it comes to human rights			0
" it would be ridiculous if that mentality -- pride from leaders on both sides -- got in the way of millions benefiting from aid , " said @entity216 , a @entity217 doctorate student who lives in the @entity219 capital of @entity220			0
however , she said , the threat thrusts the issue to the forefront			0
" we need minority rights in the continent			0
there 's a part of me that knows this threat will not have much of an impact			0
but in a way , it 's an achievement , however small			0
despite the differences in opinion ... it has brought the conversation out in the open			0
" the @entity244 of @entity219 said while @entity46 's remarks are a positive gesture , they risk turning homosexuals into targets			0
it urged the prime minister to instead consider directing some aid to community programs aimed at fostering dialogue and tolerance			0
" support national and regional human rights mechanisms to ensure the inclusiveness of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender issues in their protective and promotional mandates , " the group said			0
as the prejudices rage on , gays and lesbians in the continent lead fidgety lives , including forming underground movements that change locations regularly for safety issues			0
sexual violence against lesbians has become so common in @entity12 , the nation has coined a new term " corrective rape " to describe it			0
@entity12 -- one of the more progressive nations in the continent on the issue -- was the first @entity57 country to impose a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation			1
@entity46 said he does not expect a sudden change in mindsets , and admits it will take time			0
journalist @entity286 contributed to this report from @entity180 , @entity94			1
