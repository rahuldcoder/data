@entity0 -- @entity2 launched a new @entity4 tabloid sunday to replace his disgraced @entity5 , seven months after the best - selling sunday paper was shut down over a phone - hacking and bribery scandal			1
the " new " newspaper is n't entirely new -- it 's a sunday edition of @entity2 's @entity11 tabloid , which had been a six - day - a - week paper until now			1
its leading editorial on launch day took a defensive tone in discussing the closure of the @entity5			1
" @entity11 has been a tremendous force for good , " its editors insisted			2
" it is worth reminding our readers , and detractors , of that as we publish our historic first sunday edition			0
" the parent company of both tabloids , @entity26 , " closed our sister paper the @entity5 over the phone hacking scandal			1
since then some of our own journalists have been arrested , though not charged , over allegations of payments to public officials for stories , " the editors said			0
" we believe those individuals are innocent until proven guilty , " they said			0
the first edition of the sunday tabloid sets a tone like that of its weekday sister , leading with the story of a television presenter 's difficult childbirth and putting a scantily - clad picture of singer @entity46 on page three -- a slot occupied by topless models during the week			1
@entity51 's hospitalization at the age of 93 makes page 8 , under the headline " @entity55 " and above a picture of actress @entity57 in a low - cut dress accepting an acting prize			2
under @entity2 , @entity5 specialized in undercover investigations and salacious stories that earned it the nickname " @entity5			0
" but revelations last year that it had paid for the hacking of voice mail messages to murder and terrorism victims and fallen troops , as well as celebrities and politicians , forced the paper to close			0
police are running three separate investigations -- into phone hacking , e-mail hacking , and police bribery -- and two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry are also probing @entity4 press practices			1
@entity2 testified before one of the panels of lawmakers last year , calling it the " most humble day of his life			0
" a former spokesman for prime minister @entity89 , @entity91 editor @entity90 , is among those arrested			0
no one has been charged			0
the @entity94 launched with a print run of 3 million , far more than any daily newspaper sells in @entity4 , but well below the 4.75 million sales for the last issue of @entity5 , according to its publisher			2
@entity5 was 168 years old and among the best - selling newspapers in the world when it closed .			1

the @entity11 on sunday launches after @entity5 closed in disgrace
@entity5 was at the center of a hacking and bribery scandal
the @entity11 strikes a defensive tone talking about the scandal in its editorial
it 's aiming to replace what was the best - selling paper in @entity4
