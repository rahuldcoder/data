editor 's note : this post was created for your reading pleasure as a collaborative effort between the editorial staffs of @entity7 and @entity8			1
( @entity7 / @entity8 ) -- @entity10 the red panda is the most recent zoo animal to prove it truly is a jungle out there			1
on monday , the @entity13 in @entity14 announced that little @entity10 had gone missing			1
thankfully , by the end of the day , he was back in his enclosure and no longer wandering around the big city unchaperoned			2
@entity10 's adventurous day in @entity14 is , obviously , not the first nor the strangest story of an escaped animal running amok			1
do n't worry , though , all these have relatively happy endings ! 1 ) @entity23 and @entity24 : the gorillas that escaped , more than once , from the @entity26			2
these two gorillas were a pretty big headache for the zookeepers at the @entity26			2
the primates in crime escaped so many times that the zoo received a warning from federal officials , according to @entity36			2
the zookeepers were housing them in an enclosure originally intended for bears ; the gorillas would use vines to climb out , even one time bounding the wall with a running jump			2
2 ) @entity44 : the lioness that escaped into @entity47 's backyard			1
in the late ' 90s , a 450 - pound lioness named @entity44 -- after a character in @entity47 's " @entity50 " -- escaped from @entity52 's @entity51 when handlers were cleaning her cage			1
the declawed lion prowled the area , much to the chagrin of residents			2
thankfully , no one was hurt			2
after a few days on the loose , @entity44 was found by a search team and returned to her pen			1
3 ) @entity62 : the wolf that escaped from the @entity26 and may or may not have been recaptured			2
the story of @entity62 the wolf is one of the stranger ones			2
the timber wolf escaped from her enclosure three times in the 1970s before she finally got out for good			2
it 's unclear , however , what happened to the antsy wolf after that			1
4 ) the 170 + @entity76 monkeys that took over @entity77 in the 1930s			2
this kooky incident happened at an old - timey exotic animal park run by famous animal collector @entity81			0
according to the original 1935 @entity86 article , the monkeys ' area was left open one night , they got out and went bananas in a neighboring town			0
local law enforcement realized something was up when they started getting more than a few phone calls reporting monkeys crawling around people 's houses			1
@entity81 's jungle camp even offered a season pass to any resident who returned a monkey			1
5 ) @entity99 : the " @entity100 " of the @entity101			0
@entity99 is easily the @entity101 's most famous -- and successful -- simian escape artist			1
he became famous in the ' 80s for his numerous , daring escapes			0
he even taught another orangutan how to use a branch the way a human uses a crowbar to bust out of their enclosure			0
in 2000 , @entity99 was euthanized in captivity after being sick with cancer			1
the @entity113 wrote an obituary for the beloved orangutan			0
" with the solemnity usually reserved for the passing of revered civic leaders , @entity101 officials on friday announced the death of @entity99 , an escape - artist orangutan so beloved that he had his own fan club , " wrote @entity116 , a @entity86 staff writer			1
6 ) @entity125 : the hippopotamus that would n't stay put			0
it 's pretty tough to tell hippopotamuses what to do			1
they 're very large and do n't exactly take direction			0
that 's what one village in @entity134 learned firsthand			1
in 2010 , after some flooding in the area , @entity125 escaped her pen and made her way into a body of water in the nearby village of @entity144			0
the villagers did n't mind @entity125 swimming around their homes , though , and she ended up being a pretty popular celebrity in the area			0
she was eventually brought home after floodwaters receded			0
7 ) the nine bison that ran loose in @entity153 only to be coaxed back into their enclosure with bread			0
in 1997 , nine half - ton bison made a break for it from the @entity160			0
the herd did n't get very far , about 200 feet from the zoo grounds to be exact			0
the zookeepers lured the roaming bison back with pieces of bread			0
8 ) @entity167 : the rhino that ran away from home after his mate left him for a younger rhino			0
it seems like rhinoceroses can go on jealous rampages , too			0
according to @entity178 's @entity177 , @entity176 was a two - ton rhinoceros that threw a jealous tantrum inside the @entity181 near @entity182			1
the 18 - year - old male escaped his enclosure and ventured into another section of the zoo where other rhinos were held before wandering back into his pen			0
the zookeepers figured it was because of @entity176 's mate @entity192 pairing up with a younger rhino			1
9 ) the penguin that escaped a @entity197 aquarium			0
last year , a @entity199 penguin escaped from @entity200 and spent a whopping three months waddling around the city			0
the 1 - year - old fugitive was recaptured after being spotted multiple times swimming around @entity204			0
the penguin came back to the aquarium in good condition , apparently fit for big city life			0
10 ) and of course , the clever @entity209 cobra			1
in march 2011 , an @entity211 cobra slithered away from the @entity209 's @entity212 -- and into the hearts of @entity215 users			1
after a few days of searching , zoo officials found that the elusive snake had n't gotten very far ; she was hiding among pipes in a holding area in the zoo 's reptile house			1
they lured the cobra out using rodent - scented wood shavings .			1
