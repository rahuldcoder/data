-- a clean - cut young man buys tons of fertilizer , which he uses to create a huge bomb			2
he puts it into a box truck , brings it into the middle of the city , and then sets off a massive , and deadly , blast			0
that happened in 1995 , when @entity12 unleashed terror in @entity14			1
and it happened again friday in @entity16 , @entity17 , when , police say , a 32 - year - old man sparked a explosion that killed seven people in the heart of the city center			1
in @entity17 , the suspect allegedly and then traveled 20 miles to @entity26 island , where he gunned down at least 85 others at a youth camp			0
sixteen years and nearly 5,000 miles separate the sites of the bombings			0
yet @entity31 , executive director of the @entity32 and @entity33 , said she has been flooded by calls and e-mails from survivors , victims ' relatives and others affected by the attack in that @entity42 city who have been shaken by this week 's violence in @entity45			1
" it 's a senseless and needless attack , " said @entity31 , noting that the @entity17 incident caused " flashbacks " for many			1
" and it 's almost exactly what our people went through			2
" it has struck close to home in two parts of the world , in part because both @entity12 and the prime suspect in the @entity17 attacks are being painted as " domestic terrorists			1
" scores of innocent civilians , including a number of children , were killed in both locations as attackers went after symbols and institutions -- in @entity12 's case a @entity71 federal government building , and in the other a @entity17 government building and a youth camp affiliated with the ruling political party			1
@entity12 had some help from @entity77 , who was convicted and is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and manslaughter for helping build the bomb ; and @entity82 , convicted for failing to alert authorities			2
meanwhile , acting national police chief @entity84 said that although only one man had been arrested as of saturday , @entity17 police have yet to determine definitely that only a single person was responsible for both of the @entity17 attacks			2
growing up , @entity12 did n't appear to stand out , working at @entity89 and a security guard			1
with his crew cut , the son of a automobile factory - line worker and homemaker looked the part of an all - american and even joined the military , where he became a decorated @entity99 veteran before leaving the service			0
@entity101 , who @entity17 media have identified as the first and then only person detained in the more recent attack , appears to fit the role of a quintessential @entity17			2
pictures show him with blond hair , blue - green eyes and chiseled features , dressed in a preppy style			0
he had been a youth and adult member of the conservative @entity113 ( @entity113 ) or @entity113 , @entity115 newspaper reports , but there has been no indication he 'd ever been arrested prior to this week			0
yet police say they believe the @entity17 is responsible for the deadliest attack ever on its soil			2
that was true for @entity12 , too , before the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			2
" when it 's one of your own , when it 's one of our folks doing it to us , it 's hard to stomach , " said @entity31 , who joined the memorial effort soon after the 1995 attack			1
both @entity101 , according to reports , and @entity12 had extreme political agendas			2
in the @entity71 's case , this included a growing disillusionment with the federal government			0
he viewed its treatment of the @entity142 people as that of a schoolyard bully , then became angered at its role in the disastrous raids at the @entity149 compound at @entity150 , @entity151 , and the cabin of white separatist @entity153 at @entity155 , @entity156			0
up through his execution in 2001 , @entity12 never expressed remorse for his role in the @entity14 bombing that left 168 dead			1
the suspect in the bombing and mass shooting in @entity17 conceded the terrorist attacks in that nation were " horrible , " but " in his head ( they ) were necessary , " a man who identified himself as the suspect 's lawyer told @entity17 broadcaster @entity170			0
@entity173 told @entity170 late saturday that @entity101 " is ready to explain himself " in a court hearing monday			0
the fact the @entity17 suspect does n't look the part of a terrorist , especially in an age marked by threats and strikes by members of the @entity185 fundamentalist group @entity184 , does n't surprise @entity31			0
one thing the @entity14 bombing taught her is that " evil does n't have to look like a monster			1
" that is one of many lessons learned by people in and around @entity193 's capital			1
@entity14 mayor @entity194 said that another is that there 's no one , clear path toward emotional recovery from such a traumatic event			1
" it 's impossible to sum up the emotions of an entire city , " the mayor said			0
" it 's so emotional individually			0
" @entity194 said that , in time , the experience made the @entity14 " stronger , " more united and more patriotic , invigorated by the sense that " we were not going to let a criminal act tear us apart			1
" and @entity17 prime minister @entity209 spoke to this sentiment hours after the attacks , when he vowed , " you wo n't destroy our democracy ... no one will bomb us into silence			0
no one can scare us from being @entity17			0
" the people of @entity14 know , more than most , that such resiliency is possible -- but it is also difficult			1
@entity31 said that the city 's memorial and museum plans to offer its assistance to the people of @entity17 , including children 's psychiatric counseling and other resources			1
one lesson that the @entity42 city 's residents have learned , the hard way , is that evil exists and it can strike at any time -- at times perpetrated by seemingly the least likely people			1
" it seems so simple that we should be able to stop this , but it 's so much harder than that , " @entity31 said			0
@entity0 's @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
