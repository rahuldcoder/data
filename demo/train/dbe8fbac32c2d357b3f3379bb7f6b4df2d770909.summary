-- " where do you live ? " @entity2 highlights territorial disputes , such as one between @entity5 and @entity6 over @entity7			1
seems like a simple question , does n't it ? but the answer is not clear - cut for everyone			1
take people who live in @entity13 , the capital of @entity14 , which is wedged between @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			2
@entity15 and @entity16 have gone to war repeatedly over the disputed territory			2
technically , it 's " @entity15 - administered			1
" but on @entity2 , it 's simply in @entity15			1
@entity22 , a journalist in @entity13 , was slightly uncomfortable about the classification			0
" as far as the traditions of the people are concerned , the political issues , it might not match with the people 's mindset , " he said , even while conceding it could be seen as accurate			2
" it is administratively part of @entity15 , so as far as that is concerned , it is correct , " he said			0
" but it does n't gel with the mood of the people			0
" the @entity15 government is very sensitive about how international media organizations characterize @entity14 , he said by phone from @entity13			0
" if the economist ( magazine ) publishes a map which is related to @entity15 or @entity14 , if that map is not acceptable to the @entity15 government , they put a stamp when ( the magazine ) reaches @entity15 saying these maps should not be treated as as authentic , " he said			0
@entity13 is just one of many examples of the diplomatic minefields social - networking sites can stray into when seeking basic information about their users			2
@entity2 recently changed its listing for the @entity7 -- which @entity5 captured from @entity6 in 1967 -- so users there could choose to say whether they live in @entity5 or @entity6			1
it was responding to pressure from a @entity60 group called @entity61 -- and from @entity2 users who set up a group on the site itself called " @entity2 , @entity65 in @entity5 , not @entity6			1
" " it is not for @entity2 to decide the national origin of @entity7 residents , " the group says on its page			1
@entity2 may have pleased @entity60 users there by giving them the choice to say where they live , but not all @entity6 were happy about the change			1
" i think @entity2 sort of shot itself in the foot to make it optional for the @entity7 to say this is part of @entity5 , " said @entity75 , a @entity6 scholar based in the @entity76			1
" this is against international law , " he said			0
and the @entity7 is only the tip of the iceberg			2
@entity84 , which remains hotly disputed between @entity5 and the @entity85 , is simply in @entity5 as far as @entity2 is concerned			1
@entity87 's capital @entity88 is in @entity17 on @entity2 , although many tibetans and their supporters reject @entity17 's rule of @entity87			1
the " @entity87 " group on @entity2 has nearly 188,000 members			2
@entity94 and the former @entity96 republic of @entity97 briefly went to war last summer over the breakaway @entity97 territories of @entity100 and @entity101 , but the @entity100 capital @entity103 is listed as being in @entity97 on @entity2			1
two pro-independence @entity100 @entity2 groups have about 1,200 members between them			2
the social - networking site " deals with the listings for disputed territories on a case - by - case basis , " @entity2 representative @entity106 told @entity0 by e-mail			1
she said the site -- which recently announced it has 300 million users -- consults the @entity115 , the @entity116 and other global organizations			0
" we also may consider other factors when trying to determine if dual listings would make sense for a given city or region			0
for example , @entity13 -- the example you gave -- is in the @entity15 - administered region , and has been since 1947 , " she said			2
" we will continue to look at the listings we provide and may offer more dual listings in ( the ) future			0
we will also listen to requests from our users and in the cases of disputed territories we may try to come up with options that enable them to choose one of two countries , " she added			1
@entity22 , the journalist in disputed @entity13 , suggests that @entity2 " should have a separate section for disputed areas			1
" that 's a solution that @entity143 appears to have embraced -- up to a point			0
it offers " disputed territory " as an option for users creating a new account , but wo n't actually register a new account if users choose that option			2
it does allow users to say they are from @entity153 -- which @entity17 considers a renegade province and is not represented at the @entity116 -- and the " @entity155			0
" but it does not appear to allow users to create an account if they choose " @entity155			0
" it does not offer @entity87 , @entity14 or @entity100			0
@entity159 , for its part , offers @entity153 and " @entity155 , " as well as @entity160 , a breakaway region of @entity161 that is not recognized internationally			0
it does not offer @entity87 , @entity14 or @entity100			0
neither @entity143 nor @entity159 responded to repeated @entity0 requests for comment			0
but if @entity2 's experience with the @entity7 is any indication , they may all be getting comments from users soon enough			1
@entity0 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's " where do you live " question causes *problems* for some
those who live in disputed territories are *unsure* how to answer
the social network says it deals with the issue on a " case - by - case " basis
@entity2 allows @entity7 residents to choose " @entity6 " or " @entity5 " as home
