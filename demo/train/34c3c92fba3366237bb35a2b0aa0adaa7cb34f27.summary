-- the wife of slain @entity3 prisons chief @entity2 told @entity0 thursday that she refuses to be angry over the news that the parolee believed to have killed her husband was released from prison four years early because of a clerical error			1
court officials admitted this week that an error allowed 28 - year - old @entity11 -- the man authorities have linked to @entity2 ' killing last month -- to be released in january			1
" much like the incident itself , i could become enraged			2
for the rest of my days , i could be angry that someone made a mistake and did n't capture what a judge conveyed , " @entity17 told @entity0 's @entity18 in her first interview since the march 19 shooting			1
" but it wo n't bring @entity2 back , and then my life is in that and my ability to be a good mother to my children			1
so i choose not to make it a focus			2
" the error dates back to 2008 when @entity11 pleaded guilty to punching a prison guard in the face while serving an eight - year sentence for armed robbery and menacing			0
a judge ordered him to serve another four years consecutively , but a court clerk entered the sentence as concurrent , according to documents and court officials			0
2 men questioned as @entity3 manhunt continues authorities believe @entity11 rang the doorbell of @entity2 home and opened fire when @entity2 opened the front door			1
@entity17 said she and her daughters , @entity53 and @entity54 , are praying for " our ability to forgive			1
" " i think it 's not perhaps a point in time thing			0
i think it 's something we grow into , " she said			0
fighting back tears , @entity2 ' wife and two daughters described a loving family man who was more than just his job description			1
associate of suspected @entity3 killer arrested " i see him as my dad			1
he intervened in my life so many times , and he really changed my path			0
i just want people to know that , that he 's my dad , " @entity72 said			0
his daughter , @entity53 , said : " i would like people to see how he lived his life , and that is so much more important than how he died			0
he lived his life with such passion and compassion for other people			0
" @entity2 and his wife met at age 19 while both were studying sociology			1
@entity17 said she was drawn to her husband because of his compassion , his desire to help people			2
" at a very early age , that was very interesting to me , " she said			0
the family told @entity0 that they are trying to move beyond the actions that led to @entity2 ' killing			1
that 's due in part to stories @entity2 shared with them			2
@entity100 , wife remembered at memorial service often , the prisons chief met with victims of crime			1
many told him how their lives had been ruined by violence , and they were unable to forgive the perpetrator			2
but some of the victims told @entity2 they had to move past it , they had to live their lives			2
" it would just be the ultimate tragedy , if @entity2 's life were this horrific end and my life was destroyed by it , " @entity17 said			1
she has taken comfort from a passage from scripture that says " when darkness overtakes the godly , light comes bursting through			0
" " that horrific night , and the sound of that doorbell and all that happened was just unmentionable darkness , " she said			0
" i trust that people will see light coming through , that they will see a man lived a good life and people 's lives were impacted by that			0
