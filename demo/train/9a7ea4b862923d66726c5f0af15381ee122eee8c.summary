in downtown @entity1 , dozens of new technology companies are about to be born			2
more precisely , they 'll be born at a new incubator and workspace called @entity5			2
it sits on the top floor of a glass - encased modern office building			0
with windows providing a 360 - degree view of the city , everything that makes @entity1 one of the fastest growing cities in the country can be seen from its more than 200 desks			2
@entity5 is a collaboration between the @entity19 and @entity20 -- a man who has become so integral to the city 's start - up scene that he 's known as the " @entity24			1
" @entity20 originally founded @entity5 in 2009 as a start - up accelerator focused on helping young companies get started and attract investors			1
in may , the chamber selected it to run the 22,000 - square - foot space that @entity20 hopes will make a city with an already thriving tech scene even better by creating a downtown hub			1
" it 's a focal point , a center of gravity , " he said			1
" when companies look to move to @entity1 , this is the first place they should stop			2
" it 's also a natural extension of the altruistic , entrepreneurial spirit that @entity20 advocates and @entity1 , host city to the annual @entity42 , embraces			1
capital factory is n't designed to make a lot of money ; @entity20 said he mostly hopes it breaks even			0
but a successful @entity5 could mean dozens , and eventually hundreds , of new companies will call @entity1 home			1
@entity52 start - ups will vie for the opportunity to move into a lush workspace they could never afford on their own			0
those that are chosen will join " anchor companies " like @entity60 's @entity59 , which was one of the first companies to move in to the space			0
@entity60 's web - hosting company is growing rapidly and he said renting seats for his staff of 20 in @entity5 was a no brainer			1
" for a growing company like us , it 'll take , like , 40 people before this is more expensive than getting our own space , " he said			0
the idea behind the factory , @entity20 said , is that hundreds of people from dozens of start - up companies working in proximity to each other will lead to stronger businesses			2
@entity60 's company will be one of the biggest ; the average size of the start - ups is expected to be 2 - 5 people			0
from @entity60 's perspective , the more people and companies the better			0
" the fact that they 're all kind of smooshed up together and going through the same crap , the highs and the lows , and the questions and the dilemmas in a space where we could bounce ideas off each other -- that alone is worth the price of admission , " he said			0
" it 's an experience you could never get in any other way			0
" that co-working environment is at the heart of @entity20 's plan to help @entity1 's tech sector continue to thrive			1
with an unemployment rate under 6 % , @entity1 is a bright spot in what has been a gloomy national economy			0
tech start - ups have played a huge role in keeping the @entity1 economy strong , with more than 4,000 companies employing more than 100,000 people			1
@entity20 believes that a space like @entity5 will give @entity1 - based companies a new advantage when it comes to hiring in the future			1
the no. 1 problem for many tech start - ups is recruiting great engineering talent			0
@entity20 said @entity5 will be the edge @entity1 needs			1
" we 're going to be bringing in just a pipeline of talent and we 're going to be teaching them the skills that they need , " he said			0
" they 're going to walk in here and say ' wow , this place is amazing			0
i want to work here			0
which companies are here ? ' " technology start - ups may be nothing new to @entity1 , but @entity20 's @entity5 takes a new approach to fostering them			1
partners and mentors include @entity143 , the local @entity19 , the @entity144 , @entity146 - based entrepreneurial - education company @entity145 and @entity20 's own network of 20 mentors			1
for @entity20 , it 's about making the home that he loves even better			2
" at the start of it , this is around community , " he said			0
" it 's creating the kind of place and the kind of environment that i want to live and work in			0
" @entity20 came to @entity1 in 1999 , recruited directly out of @entity160 at the height of the first dotcom boom			1
for someone who would go on to build a network of tech leaders , the timing could n't have been better			0
now he leverages associations from those days to create an entire network of mentors in @entity1			2
with @entity20 's urging , dozens of successful @entity170 now take it upon themselves to help the next generation			2
they do this through @entity20 's start - up accelerator , as well as at his start - up 101 class at the @entity144			1
" there were entrepreneurship classes and business classes , but our class is more of a practicum for student entrepreneurs			0
they 're already working on start - ups , now they get credit for doing that , " he said			0
@entity20 even holds weekly office hours at an @entity1 coffee shop , offering start - up advice to anyone who asks			1
that level of commitment has made baer the young generation 's face of @entity1 entrepreneurship			2
it 's hard to find a start - up in @entity1 where the players do n't know him , and maybe even harder to find a ceo who does n't like him			1
@entity203 of @entity1 - based @entity204 made a point to attend the launch of @entity5 , and he did n't mince words			1
" i might go so far as to suggest he 's been as influential on this generation of entrepreneurs in @entity1 as @entity210 was in his era , " he said .			2

@entity5 aims to attract , keep tech startups in @entity1 , @entity214
" @entity24 " @entity20 says 22,000 - square - foot space will be a focal point
*backers* say putting lots of startups in one space creates *excitement*
@entity143 , @entity144 are part of the center 's network
