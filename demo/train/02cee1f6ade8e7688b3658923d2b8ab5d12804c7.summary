beauty companies have long faced an ugly dilemma in @entity3			0
local laws and regulations require animal testing for cosmetic products sold in the country , which has made the lucrative market a tricky area for brands that want to sell in @entity3 without alienating consumers in other places that frown upon animal testing			1
