-- full disclosure : i have loved watching the @entity3 on television since @entity5 and thoroughly enjoyed being in the cities for the run - up to @entity8 and @entity9			1
but those who moan and groan about the " costs " of the @entity14 movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city			1
@entity18 is a great , safe and hopefully cost effective choice to host the @entity20			1
the @entity22 capital achieved a crushing victory over rivals @entity25 and @entity26 in saturday 's final @entity27 ( @entity27 ) vote			1
as the @entity30 notes , the current budget projections are 0.2 % of 2012 gdp			2
plus , more than half of the $ 8 billion build - out cost projections is already set aside , the new hosts tell us			2
construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts			2
architects have already been hard at work			2
full - time and part - time jobs will be created			1
sure , the budget will rise			2
@entity44 tripled its initial budget estimates to $ 14 billion for the construction , security etc. and privately raised $ 3 billion or so to stage the games , from corporate sponsors , ticket sales and broadcasting rights			2
construction money came from taxpayers and lottery funding			2
in fact , once @entity44 confirmed its final budget about five years before the @entity14 , it stuck to it			1
now , @entity3 are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs			0
many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places			0
let 's hope @entity68 's $ 10bn budget ( or more ) is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year - round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a @entity76 grand prix			1
and yes , you can always point to the abysmal state @entity79 was left it with its stadium after 1976			0
it took something like 30 years to pay off			0
@entity79 is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow			0
it has rightfully scared the @entity27 and host cities into getting it right , or face financial headaches for years to come			1
@entity91 was also a prescription for how not to do it			0
expensive white elephants still sit idle			0
the last minute " @entity96 " rush to finish off some venues and infrastructure plans inevitably lead to higher costs			0
@entity98 ' 96 was no great success either , but for the start of the trend to plan the use of big venues , before the @entity14 began			1
the @entity104 was partially knocked down and used by the city 's popular baseball team			1
@entity107 and @entity44 went in other ways -- new stadia for the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics -- with a vow to keep the spirit of the @entity3 in the building 's bones			1
while @entity107 's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction , @entity44 's will be home to a mix of football , athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes , lots of tourists			1
speaking of tourists , those who stayed from @entity44 in droves last summer , were here this summer , i can tell you			0
i have not suffered from @entity44 being so busy as july and august just gone			0
@entity44 also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city			0
sure , the poor in the area should have had that already , but now they do ; along with new schools , swimming pools and housing			0
could @entity14 money be " spent " in better ways ? not likely			1
governments often go over budget and over time when undertaking large infrastructure projects			1
the @entity3 give cities one big , wonderful immoveable objective ; a deadline			0
as @entity154 is now learning , there is no pressure like the pressure of @entity27 inspectors .			0

@entity18 will host the @entity14 for the second time in 2020
the @entity22 capital *previously* hosted the @entity20 in 1964
@entity18 was *awarded* the @entity14 in 1940 , they were later *canceled* *due* to @entity163
@entity18 *defeated* @entity26 and @entity25 in saturday 's vote in @entity166
