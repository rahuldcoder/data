@entity0 -- two of three women believed to have been held captive in @entity0 for more than 30 years met the man suspected of holding them through a " shared political ideology , " @entity0 's @entity2 revealed saturday			1
police announced thursday they had arrested a couple on suspicion of being involved in forced labor and domestic servitude after authorities took a @entity14 woman , 69 , @entity16 woman , 57 , and 30 - year - old @entity17 to safety from a property in @entity20 , south @entity0			1
they said the man and woman were both 67 and not @entity25 nationals			2
in a statement saturday , @entity27			2
@entity28 said the suspects were of @entity31 and @entity32 origin and had arrived in @entity25 in the 1960s			1
" we believe that two of the victims met the male suspect in @entity0 through a shared political ideology , and that they lived together at an address that you could effectively call a ' collective , ' " he said			1
" the people involved , the nature of that collective and how it operated is all subject to our investigation , and we are slowly and painstakingly piecing together more information , " he said			0
@entity28 said the collective somehow ended , but the women continued to live with the suspects			2
" how this resulted in the women living in this way for over 30 years is what we are seeking to establish , but we believe emotional and physical abuse has been a feature of all the victims ' lives			1
" @entity28 said the 30 - year - old woman did have a birth certificate , but that was all the official documentation police could find			1
" we believe she has lived with the suspects and the other victims all her life , but of course at this early stage we are still seeking out evidence			2
" on friday , @entity28 said that labeling the investigation as domestic servitude or forced labor was " far too simple " and that police were trying to understand " the invisible handcuffs " that had controlled the women			1
" what we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years			0
brainwashing would be the most simplest term , yet that belittles the years of emotional abuse these victims have had to endure , " he said			2
police said @entity83 alerted them to the suspects in october after receiving a phone call from one of the victims			2
" the woman found the courage to contact the charity after seeing a documentary on television we are informed was aired by the @entity96 , " it said in a statement friday			0
with the " help of sensitive negotiations " by the charity , police met with the @entity16 and @entity25 women on october 25			1
the women identified the place where they said they had been held , allowing police to rescue the 69 - year - old @entity14 woman and take all three to safety , @entity2 said			1
@entity83 spokeswoman @entity105 said the organization took " immediate action " to plan a rescue after learning of the women 's situation			0
" facilitating their escape was achieved using utmost sensitivity and secrecy and with the safety of the women as our primary concern , " she said , describing the work of those involved as " outstanding			0
" a television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of @entity83 prompted the call for help			0
" they 'd seen me on various news channels talking about forced marriage and dishonor violence , and they said i had a face they trusted , so they called our 24 - hour helpline , " @entity126 told @entity1			0
she said the process was " very difficult " and charity ceo @entity139 was personally involved in the negotiations " throughout the process until they were rescued -- so it was over a week of speaking to them -- she gained their trust and confidence , and they believed that when they came out , they would be taken to safety , they would be looked after , " @entity126 said			0
" these ladies have spent 30 years in captivity as slaves and have come out with absolutely nothing at all , " she said			1
" the road to freedom is n't going to be an easy one			0
" on saturday , @entity126 said @entity83 had seen an " extraordinary " rise in calls to its help line since news of the case broke			0
she said the three victims need to " go through their rehabilitation undisturbed , without being identified			0
