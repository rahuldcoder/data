i suppose he has a somewhat similar game to me -- he does n't overpower courses			0
" no - one on the course bettered @entity2 ' round of 67 and the @entity3 said his putting was a big factor in his impressive display			1
" i 've been playing very , very safe , so i think it 's a good thing , having in consideration the bad weather and the greens , how hard are the greens , they are tough and quick			0
" it 's a good strategy , probably is giving me bonuses without hitting the ball great			0

it was a great day , it 's big fun			0
