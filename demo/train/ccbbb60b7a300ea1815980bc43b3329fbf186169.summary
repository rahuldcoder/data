a winner of 91 grands prix in a career which has spanned 21 years , @entity1 denied he has chosen to retire because he can no longer compete with the very best in @entity2 having managed just one podium finish since coming out of retirement			1

" this is something that makes me proud , and this is part of why i never regretted my comeback			2
" the former @entity26 driver has struggled to regain his top form since returning to racing , registering just 149 points in two - and - a - half seasons back behind the wheel			1
" i can be happy with my performance and the fact that i was continuously raising my game during the last three years , " he commented			2
" but then , at some point it is time to say goodbye			2
" i said at the end of 2009 that i wanted to be measured by my success , and this is why i had a lot of criticism in the past three years , which was partly justified			2
" there is no doubt we did not achieve our goal of developing a car capable of fighting for the world championship in those three years			2
but then it is also clear that i can still be very happy about my overall achievements in @entity2			1
" @entity1 's comeback with @entity8 saw him reunited with team principal @entity51 , who he won world championships with at both @entity53 and @entity26			1
it is his decade with the @entity57 marque which cemented @entity1 's reputation as one of the sport ; s finest drivers			1
in 2000 @entity1 won @entity26 's first drivers ' championship in 21 years , going on to clinch the title in each of the next four seasons			1
" already during the past weeks and months i was not sure if i would still have the motivation and energy which is necessary to go on , " said the 43 - year old @entity66			1
" and it is not my style to do anything which i am not 100 percent convinced about			2
with today 's decision i feel released from those doubts			0
" in the end , it is not my ambition to just drive around but to fight for victories ; and the pleasure of driving is nourished by competitiveness			2
" @entity1 had been linked with a switch to @entity82 to replace the outgoing @entity83 , who will take @entity9 's seat at @entity86 team @entity85			1
meanwhile @entity9 , the drivers ' champion in 2008 , has denied his move to @entity8 has been motivated by money			1
it was very , very stressful and then there became a crunch time where there was pressure from the team , " the 27 - year - old was reported to have said in @entity86 newspaper @entity92			0
" there was one deadline and we did n't do anything with it			0
we just went on to another deadline			0
but then the decision was made			0
it really , really was tough but once i made the decision i was so much more relaxed			0
" it was not about the offer			0
i had two offers on the table which were very , very similar			0
@entity113 [ @entity112 , @entity85 team principal ] asked me what more they could have done			0
i said : ' to be honest , @entity113 , it was about the new challenge and a step that i wanted to make			0
' " @entity9 also insisted his departure has not created any animosity within the team heading into this weekend 's @entity123 @entity122			1
" i have got nothing but love for @entity113 , " he said			0
" when you are with a team for so long you generally learn to love them			0
