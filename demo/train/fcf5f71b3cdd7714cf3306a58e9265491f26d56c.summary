-- a couple of years ago , i came across a film about @entity5 's @entity4 which in the 80 's was a regular sunday outing for my family			2
the memories flooded back , i sent the link to my brother and we vowed to visit soon to buy cheap greetings cards and show our support			0
and then another film grabbed my attention			0
a young @entity17 girl learning to drive allowed us a slice of her life			0
it made me sit up			0
@entity21 is the website hosting these films and many others -- encouraging the use of digital tools to open up the experience of making and sharing your own ' story '			1
both local and global audiences can tap in -- a connection to something familiar or a learning of something unknown			0
50 new tech tools you should know about anthropology as the ' science of humanity ' has broadened , and the idea of the anthropologist has evolved			1
like with many professions , the baton has passed from trained individuals to you , to me , to a big wide world			2
these days , user generated is the norm , online communities have the power , and social media allows us to create a running commentary of our lives			1
in the 1930 's , the @entity56 project was first carried out to provide a fair representation of life in the @entity59			0
over 500 untrained volunteer observers and investigators were enlisted to record man - in - the - street conversations , keep diaries , and complete questionnaires			2
today we continue to do the same , only now using our own personal devices to create our own updates - and comment on everyone else 's			2
the woman using social media to predict future @entity21 was created in the @entity71 of @entity72 by dr. @entity73 , as an international online film archive that incorporates a strong sense of collaborative anthropology			1
films are submitted from all over the world , linked to a postcode , town , street , appearing as pins on a geo - tagged map			1
its global context is important and growing - our stories are placed alongside each others ' , all just as valid , with workshops being carried out on the ground to teach basic filmmaking skills			1
it runs an annual @entity59 competition with the actor @entity94 chairing the jury , for which the deadline is may 31			0
as an arts producer i initially saw it as a film channel - a platform for short documentaries - curated , so not a free - for - all @entity102			1
and then when catching wind of the map element , it became a heartfelt version of @entity108 's @entity107			0
healing the world through film these are not documentary films made by experienced professionals			1
some are admittedly beautifully shot , some made on mobile phones , some by 12 - year - olds			2
some have a simple story to tell , some a major issue to get across			0
it is used as a citizen journalism and campaigning platform , and there 's an obvious home for activism here			0
@entity21 is a modern day @entity129 , a moving image census - a consolidated archive that can be looked upon in 100 years time showing ' that 's how they lived			1
' but it makes everyone 's voice important , and all those who contributed can call themselves anthropologists			0
they made the most of the digital tools we have available to tell their story			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			2

@entity21 is a website where *people* can tell their stories by *uploading* short films
films are submitted from all over the world and geo - tagged to a location
@entity146 says that social media and digital tools have opened up anthropology to *non-experts*
