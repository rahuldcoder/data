-- as you 're being inundated with wall - to - wall coverage of the @entity4 caucuses this week , keep the following number in mind : zero			1
the quest for the @entity9 's presidential nomination is ultimately a race for delegates			0
with 2,286 delegates attending the party 's national convention in @entity15 at the end of august , the backing of slightly over half of that group -- 1,144 -- will be needed for @entity20 , @entity21 , or someone else to capture the prize			1
guess how many of these delegates will be selected in @entity4 on january 3			1
@entity4 matters for one reason only : the media says so			2
it 's been deemed the first " real " contest on the presidential nominating calendar , and for some reason " first " warrants wall - to - wall coverage			0
the winner -- or perceived winner -- is almost certain to get a campaign cash boost and ride a tidal wave of media - fueled momentum			0
" @entity39 , " as @entity40 once famously called it , can be a game changer			2
want to know what really happens in @entity4 in january ? not much			2
a few thousand people who care enough about politics to spend an evening at their local library or church basement will decide who gets to attend the state @entity9 's county conventions in march			0
they 'll also participate in a non-binding presidential preference vote			0
( " non-binding " means the state 's national convention delegates do not have to vote according to the preferences of caucus participants			2
) and that 's about it			0
in march , the county convention delegates will decide who attends a bunch of congressional district meetings and a statewide convention in late april and june			0
that 's when most of @entity4 's 28 national convention delegates â € ” a bit over 1 % of the total number of delegates in @entity15 â € ” will actually be chosen			1
if there 's already a likely nominee by that point , you can bet @entity4 wo n't rock the boat			2
remember @entity74 's big win in the 2008 @entity9 caucuses ? the party 's eventual nominee , @entity76 , won all of @entity4 's delegate votes at the national convention			1
the history of the @entity4 caucuses is actually a case study in the power of the media to shape -- or warp , depending on your point of view -- the nomination contest			1
" the name of the presidential nominating game is perception , and the reality of the @entity4 precinct caucuses has long been replaced by the media perception , " writes @entity90 professor @entity89			1
" it is not the caucus event per se but the media report of the event that shapes the presidential selection process			0
" the @entity102 , who stripped most nominating power from their party bosses after 1968 , first realized @entity4 's power in 1972 when the press all but declared @entity109 the " winner " after his surprise second - place finish behind establishment favorite @entity113			1
@entity109 , a liberal @entity114 candidate , went on to win the nomination			0
four years later , a little known former @entity117 governor rocketed onto the national stage by finishing second in @entity4 behind an uncommitted delegate slate			2
@entity120 eventually rolled all the way to the @entity122			0
@entity0 : @entity9 presidential field still unsettled in 1980 , @entity4 @entity124 came up with the idea of a non-binding preference vote as a way to provide more concrete results to a media mob hungry for primary - style hard numbers to report			1
the elder @entity40 's upset win over @entity132 rattled the @entity9 race that year and eventually helped earn @entity40 the vice presidential slot			1
in 1984 , @entity136 's second - place @entity4 finish beat expectations , set him up for a victory in @entity139 , and established him as the main alternative to @entity141			1
it also winnowed the field , effectively eliminating @entity144 after @entity144 finished a disappointing fifth			0
@entity0 : did @entity146 push @entity148 drug bill in 2004 , eventual @entity102 nominee @entity149 jumped from third to first place in the national polls following his @entity4 victory			2
@entity153 also surprised pundits with a strong second - place showing			0
@entity156 and @entity157 crippled each other with a barrage of negative ads. @entity156 became best remembered for his infamous election night " scream , " which further damaged his insurgent campaign			0
four years ago , @entity165 's eight - point win in @entity4 established him as a force to be reckoned with on the @entity102 side			2
@entity169 's disappointing third place finish , meanwhile , undercut her early knockout strategy and set in motion a long nomination fight that her establishment campaign was ill - prepared to fight			0
on the @entity124 side , @entity76 proved it 's possible to ignore @entity4 and live to fight another day			2
the senator 's campaign set the media expectations bar low by making it clear he was focusing most of his attention on @entity139			1
@entity76 's fourth place finish in @entity4 proved to be irrelevant when he rolled to victory in the @entity139			2
this time around , @entity20 's camp has tried to keep media expectations low in @entity4 -- never an easy trick when you 're seen as the national frontrunner and are therefore expected to compete everywhere			1
a first - place @entity4 finish for the former @entity190 governor -- overcoming regional , religious , and ideological obstacles -- could set @entity20 up for a huge win the following week in neighboring @entity139			1
it could also signal an early end to the nomination fight			0
conversely , if @entity21 hangs on for a first - place win in @entity4 , the former speaker could potentially narrow @entity20 's lead in @entity139 and set the stage for a more protracted contest			1
or maybe @entity201 's investment in @entity4 will reap a reward from the state 's social conservatives and earn the former @entity206 senator another look from activists in other parts of the country			1
perhaps the most intriguing possibility is a first - place finish by @entity213 , a candidate with unorthodox @entity9 views on economic , defense , and social issues			0
a victory for the @entity219 congressman -- who has a strong @entity4 organization in place -- would test the assumption that there 's a hard ceiling on his popular support			1
it could also help @entity20 by denying other candidates more favorable media attention			2
defenders of @entity4 's role in the nomination process fear a @entity213 win could potentially marginalize the state in the future by associating it with non-mainstream attitudes			1
@entity4 's @entity124 governor , @entity238 , is already trying to finesse the significance of a @entity213 victory			1
" it 's who comes in second and who comes in third as well as who comes in first , " @entity238 recently told @entity0			0
" and if somebody else does surprisingly well , it could well launch their campaign			0
so you do n't necessarily have to win in @entity4 , but you do need to be in the top three to be in contention going forward			0
" just remember : no matter who finishes first , second , or third in @entity4 , nobody will be any closer to the magic 1,144 delegate mark at the end of the night			0
the january 3 caucuses are a media expectations game , the importance of which depends entirely on voter reactions to the headlines on january 4			1
@entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , and @entity265 contributed to this report			0

no national delegates are actually at stake in @entity4 's january 3 caucuses
the caucuses are primarily a game of media expectations
@entity40 beat expectations by winning @entity4 in 1980 , helping to earn a spot on @entity132 's ticket
@entity20 is trying to keep expectations low in @entity4 -- never easy for a front runner
