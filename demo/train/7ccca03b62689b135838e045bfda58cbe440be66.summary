" we got ammunition in there and it matches the type used in the incident , " department bureau chief @entity9 told @entity2 's " @entity15			1
" @entity9 said that other items in the bag " tell us that there is a relationship between what 's in the bag , what happened saturday , what his movements were leading up to that time			1
" @entity9 would not elaborate on what else was in the bag but said " it gives us some indication to where ( @entity5 ) was and what he was doing			1
" the bag , discovered on thursday , has been transferred to @entity34 custody for further analysis , according to @entity3 spokesman @entity36			1

the teen then turned it over to a neighbor , who called police , @entity49 said , adding that " we certainly believe this is the bag			1

one of the sources said a teenager approached a @entity69 technician with the bag and that the quest employee contacted police , remaining in the area as investigators searched the scene			1
" @entity64 is working with law enforcement during the ongoing investigation , " the company said in a statement thursday			1
on wednesday , @entity9 said @entity5 was carrying the bag early saturday when he had a brief discussion with his father in the @entity84 ' front yard			1

" it was unintelligible , and then @entity5 left			1
" the elder @entity5 got in his vehicle and tried to follow his son , but could not find him , he said			2

on wednesday , @entity9 said @entity5 had previous contacts with law enforcement , but none so alarming that authorities were concerned about what he might do			2

" " i could n't underscore that more			0
" " the events that led up to what happened saturday as they relate to law enforcement contact really do not add up in their totality to anything that would cause a police officer to say			0
