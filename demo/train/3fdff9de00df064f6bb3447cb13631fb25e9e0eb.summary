-- @entity1 headed to the polls saturday for what could be a historic vote in terms of establishing the country 's democratic bona fides as well as determining its future as it faces an array of issues from high unemployment to overpopulation and terrorism			1
this year 's election has been hailed as one of the most democratic to date for a nation that for much of its 66 - year existence has had military rulers			2
according to the @entity23 , there will be 36 million new voters among the 86 million registered to vote			0
plus , more than double the number of candidates will be women , with 161 running versus the 64 who contested the 2008 poll , according to @entity30			0
yet the economic , political and security situation in @entity1 is n't especially stable			1
beyond high inflation and poverty rates , @entity1 has also seen spurts of violence , in some cases engineered by @entity38 extremists			1
since april , the @entity39 in @entity1 has killed dozens of people in attacks on the three main political parties			2
many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the biggest threats to @entity1			1
more than 600,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide to safeguard the election , information minister @entity48 said friday			1
@entity1 's army , which helped deliver 650 tons of ballots to polling stations , will have 75,000 troops out around the country , a military spokesman said			1
the governing @entity57 is led by @entity58 , the son of assassinated former prime minister and party leader @entity60			0
but in an indication of the danger facing politicians , @entity58 wo n't be out for saturday 's vote because of security threats , according to @entity1 's @entity66			1
while his party became the first civilian government to complete a full five - year term -- the three governments after the death in 1988 of military strongman @entity74 were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy			2
the @entity57 's main opposition comes from the @entity79 , led by one of the country 's leading industrialists and richest men , @entity80			2
he 's been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup and exiled when gen. @entity87 seized power in 1999			2
viewed as a religious conservative , his party -- @entity1 's second largest -- believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of @entity60 not given a massive boost to the ruling @entity57			1
another contender for leadership is @entity95 , the former star cricketer and heartthrob who leads the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) party			0
not in contention is @entity87 , who returned in march from four years of self - imposed exile to take part in the elections			0
but he 's been banned by a court from taking part in politics and his party , the @entity103 , has announced a boycott			0
@entity87 and his allies were n't the only ones upset with @entity1 's leadership ahead of the election			1
the @entity112 " strongly protested " the expulsion of its @entity115 bureau chief -- an order that @entity117 received at 12:30 a.m. locally , at his home			0
the @entity119 joined the @entity112 in slamming the move , with its @entity122 program coordinator @entity121 writing that the move suggests " a need to intimidate foreign and local journalists			0
" " the expulsion of @entity117 shows just how much the authorities fear independent media coverage , " said @entity121			0
@entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0

several parties *jockey* for leadership as @entity1 head to polls
@entity1 's struggling economy is beset by high unemployment , poverty
security is also a *problem* , especially given threats from @entity38 extremists
600,000 security personnel and 75,000 troops deploy for elections , *officials* say
