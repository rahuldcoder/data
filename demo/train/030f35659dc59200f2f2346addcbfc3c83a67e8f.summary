@entity0 , @entity1 -- dark - haired and swaddled in a white blanket , baby @entity3 is just 24 hours old , the picture of innocence in her grandmother 's arms			1
but the world she has been born into is anything but innocent			1
her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged @entity1 city of @entity0 , the heart of the uprising against president @entity18 's regime			1
her mother , 19 , has no painkillers and could not sleep after giving birth , she said , still in excruciating pain			1
@entity3 's father does not know his child has been born -- a month ago , he left the wood - cutting factory that has been turned into a makeshift bunker			1
he was going for supplies and has not been able to return , his wife says			0
@entity3 's father may live to see her , but two great - uncles will not , her grandmother says			1
both men were detained and returned as mutilated corpses			0
as she describes what happened to one of her brothers , her voice trembling , the grandmother grabs her head , wrapped in a black headscarf , and twists it to suggest a neck being broken			0
she shows a photograph of the battered body of her other brother , the state of the corpse horrific			0
@entity45 is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers , grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the @entity0 neighborhood of @entity0			1
government forces have been shelling @entity0 since early february			1
the families in the shelter have found relative safety but little comfort			2
" we 're not sleeping at night , we 're not sleeping during the day , " one mother howls , clad head to toe in black with her face covered by a niqab , an @entity65 veil showing only her eyes			2
" the children are always crying ; the bombs are coming down like this , " she laments , waving her arms for emphasis			1
they huddle in near darkness , some covering their faces as they speak to me , afraid of losing more than they already have if the government learns who they are			1
the room is filled with endless stories of death and despair			0
one woman says her son has been detained since the end of august			2
another says her son also has been held a month and a half			2
a woman named @entity89 says her brother and husband were killed when a round hit their home 10 days ago , but she can hardly pause to grieve			0
" i have to keep going , " she says			0
" i have to live for my children			2
" the families in the shelter survive on rice and lentils taken from a nearby government warehouse , but supplies are running low			1
activists gather about two dozen children for the camera and lead a song against the regime			2
but the little ones are hard to comfort			0
" my husband died on the first day of the bombing			0
they did n't let me see his body ; it was shredded to pieces			0
his blood is still in the streets , " says @entity112 , one of the mothers			0
but her focus now is on her son			0
she says he is sick with a fever , and there 's no medicine			0
" he keeps crying and saying , ' i want daddy , i want daddy			0
' i ca n't bring his daddy back , " she says , demanding to know why the world is not coming to their aid			1
" what is the world waiting for ? for us to die of hunger and fear ? "			1

women and children huddle in a makeshift shelter as the @entity1 government shells city of @entity0
" the children are always crying ; the bombs are coming down , " one mother says
" what is the world waiting for ? " another demands as her son cries for his dead father
