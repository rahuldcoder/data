-- the mother of a @entity3 teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation thursday , saying he was " slaughtered " and that she wants to know why			1
@entity6 , 16 , died over the weekend			1
his death triggered protests in @entity9 , a community in @entity3 where distrust of the police runs deep			1
" i 'm still waiting for @entity6 to come home , " @entity13 told reporters during an emotional news conference			1
she wore dark sunglasses and struggled to speak as she recalled picking the color of her son 's casket			1
" he has a curfew , " she said			2
" sometimes he 's late			1
sometimes he 's early depending on the night			1
but whatever time he gets there , i 'll be real happy to see him as soon as the bell rings			2
and for the past couple of days , the bell has n't rung			2
" according to police , plainclothes officers were on patrol in their car in @entity9 when they saw a group of men gathered on the street at about 11:30 p.m. saturday			1
as the officers got closer , @entity6 broke from the group and adjusted his waistband			1
the teen " continued to act in a suspicious manner , " so the officers got out of their unmarked car and tried to get his attention , said a @entity43 statement			2
@entity6 then " turned on them , " it said , and pointed a .38 - caliber revolver at the officers			1
they fired at the teenager , striking him			2
the teen died at a hospital , and a loaded .38 was recovered from the scene , the statement said			2
one officer fired four rounds ; another fired seven , according to @entity43 deputy commissioner @entity57			2
both are now on administrative duty			2
the officers were taken to a hospital and treated for what the department described as trauma and tinnitus , a ringing in the ears			0
@entity6 said that her son was killed in front of his best friend 's house			1
she described him as a typical teenager , into girls and hanging out with friends			0
most people in the city likely do n't believe what police say happened saturday , said councilman @entity81 , who appeared with the teen 's mother at the news conference			1
for her part , @entity13 said she did not think her son had a gun , but added , " i was n't there			1
" " he is not the public 's angel , but he 's my angel , and he 's my baby , and he was slaughtered and i want to know why , " she said			1
by monday , anger at the shooting boiled over , with a mob of young people interrupting a vigil by running wildly into local businesses , according to an eyewitness			0
police said they arrested two people that day			1
on tuesday , another protest brought out a mostly calm crowd that returned wednesday , anticipating that @entity6 's mother would speak , said ireporter and professional photographer @entity103			1
but the hope for a peaceful crowd faded when about 30 young men showed up across the street from the vigil , he said			0
" they were not coming out of the shadow			0
they were staying in the dark area of the street			0
you just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gon na go for it , " @entity103 said			0
" that just stopped the original intention of the night			0
" @entity103 began to take photos , watching as kids crossed the street toward the protesters			0
community leaders started shouting for everyone to calm down and asked anyone taking pictures to stop so they could talk to the young men and calm things down , the photographer told @entity0			0
" these kids broke loose and took off			0
the police were caught off - guard , " @entity103 said			1
" those kids really know the streets , and they 're spreading out and going down side streets away from the main street			0
" @entity140 came the sound of breaking glass and rolling trash cans , @entity103 said , and business owners quickly pulled down their metal store - front security coverings			0
one officer received a gash to his face while another was pushed off his scooter , police said			1
forty - six arrests were made , including two juveniles , with the majority charged with disorderly conduct			0
on thursday , mayor @entity157 offered condolences to @entity6 's family and said that more must be done to stop gun violence			1
" i can promise you that we will conduct a full and fair investigation , " he said			1
" i understand there 's anger in the community , but the ways to get answers is not through violence or law breaking			1
we can not tolerate that and we will not tolerate that			0
" the mayor said , " there 's nothing we can do to undo the tragedy for the family , but we 've just got to get guns out of the hands of kids and of the people who should not have them			2
" @entity9 is a place where many people distrust the police , and gun violence is part of everyday life , some residents say			1
" as a black man growing up in @entity9 , you just expect to be harassed by the cops , pulled over , arrested and now just straight up killed , " said @entity190 , a 35 - year - old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood			2
" that 's what 's happening out here			2
and kids are doing it to themselves to -- they doing the crime , too -- and you got cops who do n't live here coming in here so hard , too hard			0
that 's how we got a situation like @entity6			1
" the violence over @entity6 's death will eventually subside , but the intense distrust of police will rear itself again violently soon enough in @entity9 , said @entity212 , a senior organizer with the @entity213			1
a @entity3 resident for 41 years , he and @entity190 told @entity0 there are big problems to address			0
" there are no community centers here , " @entity190 said			0
" that has to change			0
you have to be here and get involved			0
" and for the cops , they just need to take that badge away and talk , talk to us like human beings			0
we 're asking them to do that , and we 've got ta open up and talk to them			0
we have to do our part , too			0
otherwise , this is just going to keep happening			0
