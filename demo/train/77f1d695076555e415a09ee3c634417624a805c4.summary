-- @entity1 stressed his desire to launch a new @entity4 franchise on wednesday , as the former @entity6 captain revealed his passion about becoming a future club owner			1
the former @entity11 star 's potential interest in @entity12 was leaked on tuesday , but the footballer - turned - global - icon refused to confirm or deny the reports when speaking at a launch for his new book			1
" i 'm passionate about staying in football and being an owner of a team is something i 'm passionate about , " the 38 - year - old said on a show broadcast live on @entity21 to his 30 million followers			1
" @entity12 is one of the places we looked at , and we 've looked at others too			2
" included in the ground - breaking contract he signed with @entity11 in 2007 was the option to create a new @entity4 team for $ 25 million , a right that the former @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 star is now aiming to exercise			1
" when i signed my contract six , seven years ago , my manager @entity39 actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career and obviously now i 've stopped playing , " @entity1 added			1
full details have yet to emerge of how the expansion and its funding may come about in a city whose only previous @entity4 team -- @entity52 -- was closed in 2002 , after just four years in the league			1
yet there is renewed belief that @entity12 , with many local football fans and a handful of suitable stadiums , could be ready for a new team			2
indeed , @entity61 financier @entity60 is behind a potential rival bid , having created a website -- @entity64 -- earlier this year to drum up support and suggest designs for a new stadium			0
@entity4 currently has 19 teams , and a 20th club -- @entity70 -- is set to launch in 2015			1
" it 's going to get better and bigger , " said @entity1			2
" since i moved there , 11 to 12 teams have come into the league			0
i have seen the excitement of the people talking about soccer or football			0
" @entity79 despite being slammed for a preoccupation with fame by @entity82 in his recent autobiography , @entity1 refused to slate the former @entity36 manager as he conducted an innovative digital book - signing session			1
instead , he seemed to be half - joking and half - serious when he said he had been hoping to lure the retiree back into the dug - out			0
" i 'm not going to sit here and be negative about a man who gave me a chance to play for my boyhood team , who i always dreamed of playing for , " said @entity1 , who won six @entity89 titles and one @entity90 under @entity82			1
" he believed in me and believed in the rest of the young lads who came through this with us			0
" the funny thing was i 'm involved in the @entity4 and bringing my own franchise into the league and actually he was one of the first in my phone book to contact as the manager ! " @entity1 conceded that such a prospect was no longer likely and further increased the odds when praising @entity110 , who was once @entity82 's right - hand man on the pitch but who has since been engaged in a lengthy feud with the 71 - year - old			1
" for me , @entity110 is the best captain i 've ever played under , " said @entity1			1
" he had two career threatening injuries and he set the example for us young kids			2
he was the most dedicated and driven player			0
" @entity110 has since stepped into the world of football management , with limited success , but @entity1 is adamant he will not be following what is a well - trodden path for many former footballers			2
" you should never say never , because something may happen in 10 years ' time which may make me think i should be a manager but i do n't think so , " he explained			0
" it 's not something i 'm really passionate about			2
to do something well you have to be passionate about it			2
i love coaching kids -- my own kids and other kids too -- but management is something that does not float my boat			0
" during his playing career in the @entity140 , @entity1 won two @entity4 titles with @entity11 , prior to joining @entity143 side @entity142 in january this year			1
he played his final game as a professional in may and conceded that his retirement in a match against @entity148 did not finish in the way he had hoped , as emotion got the better of him			0
" as soon as i announced my retirement , i knew the day was going to be tough -- but i did n't think it would be as difficult as it was , " he revealed on wednesday			0
" i spoke to ( coach ) @entity156 ( @entity155 ) before , who told me he would bring me off about 80 minutes			0
65 minutes came and all of a sudden i could n't breathe			0
" i got short of breath and i had a real struggle controlling my emotions			0
it was not something i wanted to do , but i could n't control it			0
" images of his final game form part of @entity1 's new book , one that takes a pictorial journey through his two decades in the game - even if a whole new chapter looks set to be needed soon .			1
