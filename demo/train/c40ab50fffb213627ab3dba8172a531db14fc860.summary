when assuming office , every government official must take an oath to abide by and uphold our @entity3			1
since 2010 , i have made that my mission in @entity7			0
unfortunately , the @entity9 administration is not upholding nor abiding by the @entity3 -- in fact , this administration is going to great lengths to continually violate it			1
its most recent transgression involves the use of domestic drones			1
these small drones are to be used as a crime fighting tool for law enforcement officials			1
but is unwarranted and constant surveillance by an aerial eye of @entity22 the answer ? in a memorandum issued by president @entity9 's secretary of the @entity28 , the stated purpose of these drones is " balancing ... obtaining intelligence information ... and protecting individual rights guaranteed by the @entity3			1
" however , flying over our homes , farms , ranches and businesses and spying on us while we conduct our everyday lives is not an example of protecting our rights			2
it is an example of violating them			0
the domestic use of drones to spy on @entity43 clearly violates the @entity44 and limits our rights to personal privacy			1
i do not want a drone hovering over my house , taking photos of whether i separate my recyclables from my garbage			0
poll : do n't use drones for speeding tickets when i have friends over for a barbecue , the government drone is not on the invitation list			2
i do not want a drone monitoring where i go , what i do and for how long i do whatever it is that i 'm doing			0
i do not want a nanny state watching over my every move			0
we should not be treated like criminals or terrorists while we are simply conducting our everyday lives			2
we should not have our rights infringed upon by unwarranted police - state tactics			2
i have introduced legislation into the @entity72 that restates the @entity3			1
this bill protects individual privacy against unwarranted governmental intrusion through the use of these drones			2
the @entity78 from @entity79 will protect @entity43 ' personal privacy by forcing the government to honor our @entity44 rights			1
i want to make it clear that i am not arguing against the use of technology			0
but like other tools used to collect information in law enforcement , a warrant needs to be issued to use drones domestically			2
the police force should have the power to collect intelligence ; however , i believe they must go through a judge and request a warrant to do so			1
the judicial branch must have some authority over drones , as they do with other law enforcement tools			2
my bill will restate the @entity44 and protect @entity43 's privacy by forcing police officials to obtain a warrant before using domestic drones			1
there are some exceptions within this bill , such as the patrol of our national borders , when immediate action is needed to prevent " imminent danger to life , " and when we are under a high risk of a terrorist attack			0
otherwise , the government must have probable cause that led them to ask for a warrant before the use of drones is permitted			0
if the warrant is not obtained , this act would allow any person to sue the government			0
this act also specifies that no evidence obtained or collected in violation of this act can be admissible as evidence in a criminal , civil or regulatory action			0
allowing domestic drones to act as spies for the government is a complete violation of our basic right to personal privacy			1
unrestricted drone surveillance conjures up images reminiscent of @entity142 's " 1984 " -- a totalitarian police - state			1
according to the @entity44 , " the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated			0
" i am sure our police force had good intentions with their suggested drone policies , but do they understand the consequences ? do they realize that they are allowing the government to act as the eye in the sky ? by infringing upon our rights and watching over our every move , the government is not going to protect us , but they will push us one more step closer to completely losing our @entity44 rights			0
my bill will protect individual privacy against governmental intrusion by these drones and establish a balance by requiring judicial action and allowing protection in court			0
i am confident that my colleagues in the @entity72 will agree with this bill			0
each and every one of us took the same oath to abide by and uphold our @entity3			1
the @entity78 from @entity79 does just that			0
overheard on @entity184 : unmanned drones ignite domestic surveillance debate follow @ @entity187 on twitter			1

sen. @entity190 says surveillance drones in the @entity43 could track everyday activity
he says it 's a violation of the @entity3 to spy with drones without **approval** by a judge
@entity190 says police should be able to get **approval** for limited use of drones
he says legislation is need to *reaffirm* the rules set out in the @entity3
