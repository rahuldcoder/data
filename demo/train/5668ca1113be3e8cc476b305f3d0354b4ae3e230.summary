@entity0 has long been a magnet for artists and art fans from around the world , so it 's no shock it crams about 300 public and privately owned galleries into its city limits			1
inevitably , the greatest symbol of the city 's recent history , the @entity12 , has been a focus for some of this creativity , spawning the @entity16 , a 1.3 - kilometer section now covered in paintings by international artists			1
it does n't stop there			0
scattered across the city are intriguing artworks related to the @entity12 -- many of which are often overlooked by both visitors and residents			1
here are eight places worth checking out			0
@entity29 a bright red oval sculpture , which -- despite its slightly battered appearance -- seems to beckon passersby to take a seat , is located in front of @entity29 station			1
during the time of the @entity12 , the @entity37 checkpoint was one of seven border crossings within the city			1
it was also the first checkpoint along the @entity12 to be opened on november 9 , 1989			1
under the name " ( e. ) @entity44 , " artists else @entity44 and @entity47 created the sculpture -- titled " @entity49 " -- as a way to point out to viewers that the former border crossing was " an interface between two systems , a chilblain of the @entity56			1
" getting there : located at the exit of @entity29			0
@entity59 : tell us what 's your favorite thing about @entity0 oberbaumbrucke at night located across the @entity16 , the @entity64 connects @entity65 and @entity66 , former boroughs that were separated by the wall			1
the bridge is worth seeing during the day , but it becomes more interesting at night			0
from dusk until one in the morning , visitors get a glimpse of " @entity73 , " a piece by @entity75 that features two round light boxes installed in the elevated railway bridge running above the @entity78			1
inside the boxes , randomized neon signs depicting contours of gestures from the popular hand game are lit up and changed every six seconds			2
" by using this game of chance , the division of the city and the significance of the bridge as a border crossing between @entity16 and @entity0 from 1972 to 1989 are put in an artistic context , " writes @entity75 about his piece			1
getting there : from @entity95 station , walk on @entity96 toward the @entity78			0
along the @entity12 on november 7 - 9 , 2014 on the weekend marking the 25th anniversary of the collapse of the @entity12 , a one - time light installation is planned that promises to be stunning			1
" @entity104 " ( border of @entity106 ) will feature 8,000 illuminated white balloons running about 15 kilometers ( about 9 miles ) along the former path of the wall			2
each balloon belongs to a " balloon patron " and represents a story about how the wall affected individual lives			2
in addition to various events and open - air exhibitions planned along the @entity104 during the weekend , there will be a ceremony on the evening of november 9 , in which the balloons will be released into the sky after a performance by the @entity122 orchestra			0
getting there : the installation will stretch from @entity125 and @entity126 to the @entity16 and @entity64			0
@entity127 in the @entity0 borough of @entity129 , 120 life - sized silhouettes of rabbits running , crouching and hopping are inlaid into the ground along @entity133 , once occupied by a former border checkpoint			1
according to @entity135 -- the artist behind " @entity136 " ( @entity137 ) -- the animals are symbolic because they were able to dig under the wall during the @entity56 and had the freedom to go where they wanted			1
the creatures were also regarded by people living on both sides of the wall as peaceful inhabitants			2
although part of @entity135 's work is currently hidden by construction in the area , many metal - plated rabbits can still be seen scattered on sidewalks , bike lanes and roads			2
getting there : from @entity158 station , walk on @entity133 toward @entity159			0
@entity160 at the former @entity160 border crossing stands an unassuming artwork known as " @entity163 -- @entity164 " ( @entity165 ) by @entity166			2
two pairs of inconspicuous gray telescopes are set up here as a symbol of the mass surveillance that took place during the era of the @entity12			1
at first glance , the installations resemble the type of telescopes set up at tourist attractions			2
however , a look through them reveals the word " @entity163 " ( " crossing " or " transfer " ) overlaid on the landscape beyond the lens , acting as a disruption to the viewing experience			0
the word 's unexpected appearance is a reminder of the site 's historical significance and how the @entity12 affected the urban landscape			1
getting there : from @entity194 station , take bus 170 , 265 or @entity196 to @entity160 and walk along @entity160 towards the @entity197			0
the @entity198 for a glimpse into what it was like to live with the @entity12 , it 's worth a visit to " @entity198 " by artist @entity203			1
from the outside , the exhibition looks like a large steel - framed cylinder			0
inside , there 's a compacted view of what daily life was like on both sides of the wall on a fictional fall day			2
" in the ' 80s , i lived on and with the @entity215 in the @entity65 district ... the many scenes from everyday life in the images presented by ' @entity198 ' show how the population came to terms with the situation and circumstances , " says @entity203 about his work			1
getting there : from @entity228 / @entity227 station , walk to @entity229 205 ( entrance on @entity231 )			0

@entity125 des 17 @entity234 the @entity234 once represented the separation between @entity16 and @entity0			1
since the fall of the wall , it 's come to symbolize @entity239 's reunification			2

commissioned and installed by the @entity269 government in 1986 , the works were painted by artist @entity273 before the fall of the wall and depict scenes from @entity269 history spanning the 1800s to the 1980s			2
