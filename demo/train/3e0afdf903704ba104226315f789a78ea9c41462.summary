-- with all the talk this week of @entity4 's manic eleventh hour rush to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a possible @entity7 default , it has been easy to forget the underlying issue : the @entity7 government will not always be able to spend more money than it receives in taxes			1
last year , @entity7 debt grew the size of the entire @entity15 economy			1
we have a government that ca n't stop borrowing , a @entity17 that ca n't stop printing and a world that is overloaded with debt			1
stock prices are being propped up , but wages are being kept down			0
this arrangement may work for @entity25 , but it is clearly not working for @entity26			1
we are supposed to be witnessing an economic recovery in the @entity7 , yet we are forever taking on more and more debt			1
we borrow money at almost double the rate of economic growth , and the @entity17 is facilitating this by artificially keeping interest rates at rock bottom			1
the market is no longer a free market -- it 's being run by the government , and that means it 's run by political decisions			0
ultimately this addiction to debt will kill any recovery , as so much tax revenue will need to be used to pay off the interest			2
currently the @entity7 pays as much in interest as the total size of the economy of a medium - sized country like @entity50			2
think about what will happen when rates really go up			0
the @entity7 is perceived to be making decisions that are based solely on its own interests			0
and the issue is not that the @entity7 can not pay its debt			2
it can , by printing more dollars			0
the real concern is the confidence foreign investors have -- or do n't have -- in the @entity7 financial system , and their feeling that they are being used as a pawn for @entity7 domestic political reasons			0
@entity7 treasuries are seen as the safest financial instrument on earth			0
if people begin to think @entity7 bonds are n't as safe a bet as they used to be , we could see the world become a very different place			0
do n't forget that almost 50 % of @entity7 debt is held by foreigners			1
@entity78 and @entity79 are the largest holders of that debt , with about 10 % each			0
they are financing the @entity7 dream			0
if they start doubting the @entity7 political situation , they will demand higher interest rates			1
funnily enough , the impact of this latest debt ceiling crisis on the market is not as negative as you would think -- mainly because the uncertainty has made the @entity17 less likely to withdraw its support , which is seen as very good thing			1
perversely , @entity7 treasury bonds become more attractive when there is more uncertainty , because of the flight to safety			0
we are in a bull market on @entity25 because interest rates are held artificially low by the @entity17 and as long as interest rates are low , people do not know what to do with their money in terms of getting a good return rate			1
we should also not forget the impact that @entity7 rates have on the global economy			2
if rates go up in the @entity7 it is very easy to see a crisis for emerging markets as global money flows return to the @entity7 , where it gets a higher yield			2
failing to increase the debt ceiling would probably not have been a huge event for the markets at first , but if the government ever defaults on its obligations , all bets are off			1
fear could easily replace greed			0
disaster seems to be averted for now , but the debt ceiling crisis is yet another unintended consequence of money printing by the @entity17 , which is allowing the @entity7 government to take on ever increasing piles of debt at absurdly low interest rates			1
without the @entity17 , rates would be much higher and it would be impossible to borrow as much money			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

fight over debt ceiling ignores bigger problem of untenable @entity7 debt load
current arrangement works for @entity25 but not for @entity26
@entity17 is allowing @entity7 government to take on debt at absurdly low interest rates
