-- the video of four @entity3 @entity2 urinating on three dead @entity5 fighters has ricocheted around the world with viral speed , rightly provoking moral outrage abroad and shame at home			1
the act is a violation of professional military conduct and the fundamental moral requirement in war of showing dignity and respect to the dead			1
but the desecration shocks , not because it involves any sadistic mutilation of body for prize or trophy , but because the act is so primitive and regressed : urinating marks territory			1
the sigh heard in the video is the vanquisher 's exuberance in being top dog			2
perhaps the @entity2 felt a need to do something with the enemy bodies that lay at their feet -- to kick them , to spit on them , to urinate on them while they waited for the proper authorities to collect them			1
but vengeful impulses need to be checked			2
command culture , especially in small units like this sniper platoon , sets the tone and helps prevent these lapses of character and the awful consequences that ensue			2
desecration of bodies in war is nothing new nor is the public condemnation of it			1
in @entity61 , @entity57 ' raging grief at the death of his beloved @entity59 leads to an ugly enactment of revenge			0
@entity57 vanquishes @entity64 , @entity59 ' killer , and then lashing the body behind a chariot , drags his corpse face down three times around @entity59 ' tomb			0
the act transgresses fundamental @entity73 decorum in war			1
@entity75 leaves no doubt about this : " that man without a shred of decency in his heart			0
" he outrages " even the senseless clay in all his fury			1
" the desecration offends the gods , too , and they intervene to insure that @entity64 's body remains intact despite @entity57 ' brutality			1
and all this comes after @entity64 pleads to @entity57 with his last breath : " i beg you , beg you by your life , your parents , do n't let the dogs devour me ... give my body to friends to carry home again " for " honor with fitting rites			0
" the soldier 's fear that his body may be despoiled by the enemy or never repatriated is universal and is at the heart of the @entity105 and customary international law that prohibit " outrages against personal dignity			1
" anyone who has watched over the body of a loved one knows that humanitarian treatment has a proper place both toward the living and the dead			2
yet we have not always respected that dignity toward our own war dead			1
consider the recent reports that the @entity123 , in charge of the military mortuary at @entity122 , shipped and incinerated remains from hundreds of troops over the past decade and dumped them in a @entity127 landfill			1
in one report from the @entity131 , @entity129 was , in her words , " appalled and disgusted " when she learned the fate of her husband 's remains : " my only peace of mind in losing my husband was that he was taken to @entity122 and that he was handled with dignity , love , respect and honor , " she said			2
" that was completely shattered for me when i was told that he was thrown in the trash			0
" why worry about remains ? i suspect it is simply because the living return to us -- however war - torn their bodies and souls -- and we want something of that for our dead , so that we can mark an honorable passage from this world			1
we demand that respect both from others who find our dead and from those explicitly entrusted to the care of their bodies			1
the @entity165 is emblematic of that very need for a return home			0
urinating on fresh corpses is repulsive mockery of the dead			1
this case is one of collective behavior , the act of a foursome or fivesome , where someone should have known better , among them and higher up			0
the incident brings to mind one that @entity181 recounts in " the things they carried , " his fictionalized memoir of his @entity185 years			0
his platoon took sniper fire and ordered an airstrike in response			0
shortly after , the unit went to the scene of the strike and found an old man , lying face - up with flies already buzzing around his corpse			0
they propped the body up against a fence , and one by one , the unit members shook his hand and faked introductions and a toast as part of a mock funeral			0
@entity181 is the only one who refrains , sickened by the indecent sport			0
he 's berated for not joining in , but one buddy is admiring : " you did a good thing today , " he said			0
" that shaking hands crap , it is n't decent			0
... should 've done it myself			0
" @entity181 demurs : " it was n't guts			0
" it does n't really matter whether what he did was an act of moral courage or moral disgust			2
the point is that he 's moved by empathy , in this case toward a civilian , but it could just as well have been an enemy fighter			2
we should n't underestimate the power of that empathy and the responsibility military leaders have to keep it alive and well in their troops			1
i 've heard of soldiers finding photos in the pockets of those they 've killed and seeing in the face of a daughter or a son or a wife the bitter loss they will suffer			0
an @entity243 who fought in the 1967 @entity245 told me recently that the thought that raced through his mind when he killed a young @entity249 who was aiming his weapon at him , was " he has a mother			0
... what will she do ? " it is that empathy that checks ugly revenge impulses in war			1
it is at the core of humanitarian rules of war and their constraints			2
join @entity263 on @entity264 and follow updates on @entity266 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			1

@entity269 : @entity2 urinating on @entity5 corpses shames the @entity3 , outrages world
it violates military conduct , she said , also the moral duty to show respect toward the dead
@entity281 : desecration of bodies in war is nothing new , but was *disdained* even in antiquity
military leaders must cultivate empathy in troops for families of the slain , she *writes*
