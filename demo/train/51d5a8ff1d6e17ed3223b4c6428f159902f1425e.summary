-- the fertilizer plant that blew up in @entity2 last week warned state and local officials but not federal agencies that it had 270 tons of highly volatile ammonium nitrate on site , according to regulatory records			1
the april 17 fire and explosion at @entity12 killed 14 people and devastated the small town of @entity15 , @entity2			2
investigators have said they 're not sure how much ammonium nitrate was actually on site at the time of the explosion , however , since plant records were destroyed in the blast			1
@entity23 tells victims ' families that nation will help them recover the company sold ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia , both commonly used as fertilizers			1
it had notified state and local emergency management officials of its stock of both in its most recent declaration of hazardous chemicals , filed in february			1
however , the risk management plan it filed with the federal @entity40 in 2011 mentioned only anhydrous ammonia , which produces suffocating fumes and can cause burns if mishandled			1
the plan listed as a worst - case scenario " the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes " and did not warn of the risks of explosion			0
federal law requires any operation that holds more than a ton of fertilizer - grade ammonium nitrate to report that stock to the @entity57			1

we have encouraged all employees to assist in the fact finding to whatever degree possible			0

the explosion happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire there			0
it registered on seismographs as a magnitude 2.1 earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away			0
town devastated by fertilizer explosion is guided by the @entity15 way last week 's explosion damaged numerous houses , a nursing home and the town 's high school and middle school , all of which were built within a few hundred feet of the plant			2
that 's raised concern about similar facilities in other towns , both in rural communities like @entity15 and major cities like @entity116 , the heart of the oil industry			0
animals become symbols of hope in @entity2 town " i know there 's hundreds of public schools on the fenceline or very close to these industrial plants , " said @entity123 , a former @entity124 of @entity126 inspector now working for the state @entity128			2
