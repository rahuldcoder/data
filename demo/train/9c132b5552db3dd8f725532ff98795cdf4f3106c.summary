-- @entity2 's controversial , and highly restrictive , new abortion law is now before @entity3 , with approval looming			1
if passed this would mean that abortions will be permitted in only two circumstances : rape , and risk of " lasting harm " to the mother 's health			1
the move would effectively reverse the abortion law of 2010 , which permitted abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy , and up to 22 weeks where there was serious risk of fetal anomaly			1
contrasting view : ' no unborn child is unworthy of legal protection ' the widespread opposition , both within @entity2 and elsewhere in @entity26 , indicates that the @entity28 's interest in the abortion law is not underwritten by a wider public and political desire to restrict abortion access			1
throughout most countries in the developed world , with notable exceptions such as the @entity35 , women 's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services , which are often publicly funded			1
but the @entity2 situation provides a shocking reminder of how quickly things can change in a country -- and the extreme consequences this can have for women			2
back in 2004 , a @entity49 newspaper wrongly accused @entity50 ( @entity50 ) of referring women to @entity2 , when they were " too late " to have an abortion in @entity49			1
the reality was that doctors in @entity2 were , at that time , legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24 - week " time limit " permitted by @entity49 law			2
in the extremely rare cases where women were desperate to access abortion late in pregnancy , they would sometimes find that only a @entity2 clinic was able to help them			2
the @entity2 law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations , but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy			1
yet barely five years on , @entity2 women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation			1
will this mean that their need for abortion goes away ? of course not			0
what it means is that @entity2 women , like @entity35 women , will be forced to travel for care to @entity49 and other @entity26 countries			1
the @entity35 experience shows with heartbreaking clarity that when a nation makes abortion illegal , it does not prevent women 's need for abortion , or their determination to access safe procedures			2
outlawing abortion simply sends the issue overseas , increasing the financial and emotional cost to women and , of course , the gestation at which they are able to access a termination			0
politicians in the 21st century must accept that abortion is a necessary back - up to contraception , and that it should be a woman 's private and personal decision that she is able to make according to what she thinks is best for her and her family			1
it is a travesty that abortion is included in the criminal statute in so many countries -- including @entity49			0
as a moral matter it should be for a woman to decide in line with her values ; she should be allowed to take responsibility for life and choose what she thinks is best			2
as a medical matter , if should be regulated like any other medical procedure			0
this point was put very nicely by the @entity128 in december 2013 , in a leading article challenging the new @entity2 law			2
" to bring the criminal law into an issue of women 's health and conscientious reflection is an abuse of government power , " argued this establishment newspaper			0
" a constitutional society does not intrude into areas of personal judgment that most citizens consider fall within the authority of the family			0
social engineering is the practice of autocratic governments			0
" @entity2 is heading towards a self - made mess			0
we know from the situation in the @entity35 , and @entity150 , what the consequences of its new law are likely to be			0
the lesson for other governments is that they should stay out of women 's personal decisions			0
" @entity163 , " proclaim the @entity2 women 's organizations protesting against their inhumane new law -- " we decide			1
" throughout @entity26 , organizations such as @entity50 will be standing behind them , and providing the services that these women need			0
but how much better it would be if they could access this care at home - as , until so recently , they could			0

@entity2 's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape *victims* or women who would suffer lasting harm
it would effectively reverse a 2010 law allowing abortion on request for the first 14 weeks
@entity175 says @entity2 woman would have to travel to other countries for terminations
@entity175 says women should be able to make a decision in line with their own moral values
