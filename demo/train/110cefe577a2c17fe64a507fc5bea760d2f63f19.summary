@entity0 -- did a @entity3 mother conspire with her boss to have her husband murdered ? that 's the case against @entity7 , who is likely to go in front of a jury in august			1
@entity7 is charged in the slaying of her husband , @entity11 , who was shot and killed execution - style in front of their son 's day care center in suburban @entity0 in 2010			1
@entity7 's boss , @entity17 , was found guilty of the crime , but mentally ill in 2012			1
@entity17 said an angel sent him on a mission to kill @entity11			2
but during the course of the trial , both @entity17 's defense lawyers and the prosecution agreed on one thing : @entity7 had a hand in the murder , too			1
she now faces 16 counts , including felony murder , in connection with the shooting			0
she has entered a plea of not guilty , with her lawyers issuing a statement saying she " categorically " denies each and " every one of the charges " filed against her			0
but if the allegations are true , what could have possibly driven @entity7 to have any part in her husband 's murder -- or to carry on an affair with @entity17 , as has been alleged ? court testimony in @entity17 's trial and family interviews in the media portray @entity11 as a man who served on the boards of nonprofits and always wanted to help others			1
he even tried to help advance @entity7 's career			2
but testimony from forensic psychiatrist dr. @entity53 , a witness for the defense , shed a different light on their relationship , some of the nature of which was gleaned from e-mails			1
" the e-mails between @entity17 and @entity7 were also discussing how there was tension in @entity7 's home between her and her husband , " @entity53 testified			1
" she was dissatisfied to say the least with his involvement with taking care of the children or even offering her support to be able to help with the children while she worked			0
" was that -- or anything else -- enough to lead @entity7 into the arms of @entity17 , as prosecutors claim ? dr. @entity79 is a sex therapist who has practiced for 13 years , and though she has not treated either party in this case , she says there are common characteristics many people share : " in general , people cheat because they are looking to fulfill something that is missing in their primary relationship			1
that could range from feelings of excitement , lust , a more robust sexual experience or simply a need to feel cared about or loved			0
" for her part , @entity7 has denied the prosecutor 's claims that she ever cheated on her husband			1
but testimony during @entity17 's trial called the nature of their relationship into question , outlining how the pair 's relationship evolved over the course of six months			1
witnesses said @entity7 and @entity17 traveled the country together and exchanged hundreds of e-mails			1
@entity53 testified that if anyone knew @entity17 was delusional , it would be @entity7			1
" we do n't know if she was able to predict what mr. @entity17 ultimately did , but we can say that if she had handled things differently in her relationship with him ( and with her husband , for that matter ) , @entity11 may indeed be alive today , " @entity111 told @entity112 in an interview			2
according to court testimony , the pair went on several work - related trips together , and it was on a trip to @entity123 , @entity124 -- their second -- that @entity17 began to feel a special connection with @entity7 , sharing with her the hard times he had growing up at a boarding school			1
but it was n't until the third trip to @entity130 , @entity131 , in mid-july that he first revealed his fondness for her , @entity7 testified			0
she also told the court that following wine and dinner , he read her a love poem , insinuating that she was beautiful			0
according to testimony from @entity138 , @entity17 says he gave @entity7 a foot massage , but she made it clear she would not leave her husband			1
she did tell him she fantasized about him , according to @entity53			0
" although both admitted that she repeatedly told him she had no intention of leaving her husband , her actions provided encouragement to his inappropriate advances , " @entity111 told @entity112			0
the court heard testimony that their next trip took them to @entity149 , where @entity17 tried to get the hotel staff to buy chocolates and flowers to leave in her room , but he settled on a note instead			0
according to the front desk manager at a @entity156 , @entity7 requested a room change			0
when she checked in on july 18 she had a room with two queen beds , but on the 21st she requested a room with one bed for two guests , the manager testified			0
on august 26 , 2010 , the pair traveled to @entity165 , @entity166 , where the two got adjoining rooms and drank wine and watched a movie together while on the same bed in their pajamas , according to courtroom testimony			0
the next day , @entity7 told @entity17 she felt terrible and that she would have to " repent " for the rest of her life			2
" when the immediate gratification of the affair wears off , many are left with the aftermath , the devastation that their affair has caused , and they can find it quite difficult to live with , " @entity111 told @entity112			0
" this inability to cope can lead to anything from denial , depression , anxiety , lashing out at others and even lashing out at oneself , which could unfortunately include self - harming behaviors			0
" a few days later , on august 29 , @entity17 asked @entity7 in an e-mail to marry him			2
the pair traveled to @entity193 and @entity165 , @entity166 , a second time before @entity11 's murder , according to court testimony			0
it was during their second trip to @entity166 , a local bartender testified , that he saw them dancing and kissing			0
a therapist testified that @entity17 said the pair were in fact physically intimate and that the next day , @entity7 again told @entity17 she would not leave her husband and expressed regret			1
but in testimony , @entity7 denied kissing or being in any way physically intimate with @entity17			2
" this type of back and forth can be very confusing , especially when directed towards someone who has romantic feelings for you , " @entity111 said			0
" when in love , we want so desperately for things to work out , for love to prevail over all			0
i do n't know that we have evidence of a conversation between @entity17 and @entity7 where they plotted and planned for @entity17 to take @entity11 's life			1
what i think is clear is that @entity7 led @entity17 , consciously or unconsciously , to believe that there was potential for a relationship in the future			2
" according to testimony and e-mails revealed in court , while @entity17 shared his feelings for @entity7 , she shared hundreds of photos of her children with him , but @entity11 is not in any of the photos			1
" @entity234 knew of his delusion or not , i find it highly inappropriate for a mother to send this many pictures of her underage children to her boss , " @entity111 said			0
" i ca n't think of any scenario where that would be appropriate , especially without my husband 's knowledge			2
" so what does all this behavior add up to ? " the fact that she never went to @entity255 " -- the company 's @entity256 -- " that she never told her husband about @entity17 's advances , the fact that she engaged her husband in a relationship with mr. @entity17 , all speak to a destructive pattern of seeking the attention , affection and insatiable needs of someone other than her husband			2
" will this and other testimony lead jurors to convict @entity7 in her husband 's murder ? jury selection begins july 29 , and @entity112 will take viewers inside the courtroom then .			1

@entity7 is set to go on trial soon in her husband 's shooting death
@entity17 has been convicted of pulling the trigger ; she is accused of being in on it
a psychiatrist says the e-mails between the two shed light on the subject
