-- last week our nation turned with grief to @entity4 , @entity5 , where 19 members of an elite firefighting squad perished in a raging wildfire			1
the media coverage of the tragedy has highlighted the dedication the men had to their work , to each other and to the families they left behind			2
what makes all of this coverage especially poignant is that , as early as this week , the names and heroic stories of these men might disappear from the headlines and fade from the public 's memory			1
for one thing , there are new tragedies : the plane crash in @entity28 that killed two people and injured countless others , the air taxi crash in @entity32 that killed 10 passengers and the horrific train derailment and explosion in @entity36			1
' i miss my brothers ' : survivor pays tribute at @entity5 firefighters while these new accidents joust for our attention , how can we ensure that the memories of the firefighters , or the victims of the crashes , remain salient in our minds ? it 's a question with important real - world implications			1
after all , it is the lasting psychological impact of a tragedy that often determines whether the public will take positive , constructive steps in its wake , like donating money to support the victims ' families or pressuring officials to determine what went wrong , in order to prevent another tragedy like it			1
while we do n't have all the answers , psychological research has started to identify how stories like those of @entity4 's @entity68 can inspire appropriate action and not just become forgotten			2
feeling an emotional connection to a victim matters -- a lot			1
studies suggest that feeling an emotional connection to one person does far more to stoke compassion than the cool rationality of numbers and statistics			1
in one eye - opening experiment , for instance , researchers @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 found that people who read the story of a single , starving @entity90 girl donated more to an anti-hunger charity than did people who read an appeal featuring statistics on starvation in @entity90			0
what 's even more astounding : the people who read the story did n't only donate more than the people who read the statistics ; they also donated more than the people confronted with the statistics combined with the girl 's story			2
this suggests not only that an individual 's story matters more than impressive statistics but that numbers actually stunt our compassionate instincts , perhaps because they make us feel overwhelmed and hinder our ability to identify with another human being			1
moreover , it 's easier to foster an emotional connection to a single person in need than to a group , even a small group			1
a study by @entity121 researchers found that people donated more money to help a single sick child than to a group of eight sick kids , even though the single kid and the eight kids were all identified in the same way , with their name , age and photo			0
opinion : when heroes face down fire -- and fate news reports emphasizing the high number of casualties among the @entity140 , such as by pointing out that these 19 lives are the most any fire department in the @entity143 has lost on a single day since september 11 , might actually be making their story stick less in the public 's consciousness			2
instead of trying to weave personal details about several of the fallen firefighters into a single story , news reports might be more effective if they focus on just one of the men at a time , including his photo and meaningful personal details			2
we 're also more likely to care about a victim when we recognize something specific that we have in common with that person			0
studies have found that people are more likely to demonstrate kindness and generosity toward others of the same race or ethnicity , as well as toward people who share their taste in art , root for their favorite sports team or have the same birthday			0
this hit close to home when i first read about the @entity140			0
when i saw the name of the team 's supervisor , @entity175 , who died in the fire , i could feel my interest in the story perk up , and i 'll admit that i found myself scanning the rest of the article for a photo or more details about @entity175 , solely because we shared the same last name			0
i knew we were n't related , but that simple connection deepened my personal investment in the tragedy			1
the lesson here seems clear : the more that stories reveal specific details about a victim , the greater the chance that they 'll help us see ourselves in that person and elicit our compassion			0
supporting the families of the fallen finally , images also seem to be critical			0
in that @entity121 study , when people were given the chance to help either an anonymous sick child or a sick child identified by her name and age , the donation amounts hardly differed			0
but when a photo was added to the sick child 's profile , donations for her medical care shot up dramatically			0
in this light , releasing photos of the @entity140 might help their story resonate with the public			0
but as we 've seen many times in the past , particularly with september 11 and @entity222 , stories often strike the deepest chord when they feature both photos of the victims and images of the tragedy that overtook them			1
none of this is exact science			0
the place of the @entity140 , and others like the plane crash victims , in our hearts and minds will depend on a host of factors , including whether they 're overshadowed by subsequent domestic and international events			1
while these tragedies are still in our thoughts , perhaps the lessons from science can help us honor the victims with compassion and respect , and , in the process , prevent similar tragedies in the future			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

the 19 brave firefighters who died in an @entity5 blaze may fade soon from memory
marsh : how can we ensure that we do n't *quickly* forget them or victims of plane crash
he says the lasting impact of a tragedy affects constructive steps in its wake
marsh : *social* science suggests that an emotional connection to victim matters a lot
