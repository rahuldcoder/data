@entity0 -- heavy snow in recent weeks has already wreaked havoc across @entity4 -- now it is damaging some of the continent 's most recognized historic monuments			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 has been forced to shut after small pieces of its walls crumbled away as a result of freezing temperatures			1
and buildings in the historic walled town of @entity16 -- a @entity17 -- are reported to be at risk of collapse under the weight of snow , following unprecedented blizzards in the area			1
in the @entity25 capital , thousands of tourists have been disappointed to discover the @entity7 , one of the city 's most popular attractions , is closed to visitors , while checks are carried out to determine the extent of the damage and to help prevent further movement			1
@entity34 , archaeologist and superintendent of the @entity7 , told @entity1 : " tests and evaluation of the damage is still ongoing , especially on the second level of arches			2
" @entity34 said the enforced closure of the site would have a serious financial impact -- the @entity7 attracts some 7,000 visitors a day , paying 12 euros for a ticket -- but that it was necessary in the circumstances			2
" at the weekend , some of the tourists did n't understand why the @entity7 was closed -- for people from northern countries , the snow is not a problem			0
" but it 's very unusual for us and it caused the detachment of dust , concrete and bricks			0
little quantities but if they fall from a certain height they can be dangerous			0
" @entity61 , spokesman for @entity25 's @entity62 and @entity63 , said the damage was caused by ice forming on the walls of the monument			1
" when the temperatures drop below zero , and there is rain and snow , it causes ice to form which , with the increase in volume , pushes the external plaster masonry and causes small pieces to fall off , " he said			1
@entity78 , senior architect at @entity79 , told @entity1 such damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather			0
" there 's a whole freeze / thaw cycle of damage to buildings where moisture gets into the stonework , into the pores of the stone , it then freezes and expands very significantly , it then breaks up the stone and then when it thaws , bits of stone will start falling off			2
" that 's happening all the time , of course , that 's one of the major decay mechanisms in historic buildings anyway , because they 're largely water permeable ... you ca n't treat stone to stop it happening			1
" in @entity16 , in the @entity108 region of @entity25 , partial collapses have been reported at the convents of @entity110 and @entity111 , while the roof of the @entity113 outside the town center has reportedly caved in			1
the town 's @entity115 ( cathedral ) is also shut , because of water damage			0
checks are being carried out on vulnerable buildings in the area			0
" our biggest worry is the buildings in the historic center , which have wooden joists and delicate roofs , " said @entity122 , a spokesperson for the local council			1
according to @entity122 , residents of some private homes in the historic center are adding extra support to the old roof beams in an attempt to prevent any further cave - ins			0
" it 's an enormous quantity of snow compared with what we normally get in winter and it 's had a heavy impact , the equivalent of a flood , " said @entity122			2
@entity61 agreed that conditions were exceptional : " maybe every 30 years it gets this cold , but it 's very rare			0
" a number of @entity25 's historic monuments , including the @entity7 and @entity147 , have suffered in recent years from damage and collapse			1
the @entity7 , which is scheduled to reopen to the public thursday , is due to undergo restoration works later this year with sponsorship from luxury brand @entity152			0
in case of similar snowfalls in the future , @entity61 in @entity8 suggests using a type of cold - weather " blanket " for exposed monuments such as the nearly 2,000 - year - old @entity7			1
though @entity78 said such plans may be difficult , on a practical level : " for a building like the @entity7 , i should think it would cost a fortune to cover it , because we 're talking about a huge wall area			0
" and while delicate , these buildings are nonetheless tenacious when it comes to adverse weather and acts of god			0
after all , said @entity122 , the @entity172 in @entity16 , which is around 500 years old and a @entity17 , managed to resist collapse during the earthquakes of the 1990s and is so far holding out against the snow			2
@entity176 in @entity8 contributed to this report .			0
