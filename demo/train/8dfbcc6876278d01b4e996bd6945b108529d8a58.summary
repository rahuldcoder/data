-- when " sorcery " was demonstrated during the @entity3 presentation at the @entity4 in 2010 , it was touted as the quintessential game for the new move motion controller , showcasing how action can be directed with the new device			1
fast forward two years , and " sorcery " does n't quite live up to expectations of what the @entity12 system could be			1
despite some controller issues , it still offers a fun experience though			1
in it , you step into the role of @entity21 , a young apprentice in the art of magic who is thrust into battle against the dark forces to save a faerie princess , @entity27			1
the princess , by the way , is a cat with a very long tail			1
as the game progresses , @entity21 discovers the ability to cast new spells , which the player casts using the move controller			1
a flick of the wrist helps you select your spell and target your enemies			2
the navigation controller keeps @entity21 moving while you blast bogeys and assassins with the wand controller			1
spell selection is done by holding down the move button , then making the appropriate gesture to select your spell -- down for an earth spell , counterclockwise for an ice spell and so on			2
switching spells is quick and very responsive			0
players can also combine spell effects for more powerful attacks			1
using an ice spell three times will freeze an enemy and allow them to be shattered with a magic missile			0
a whirlwind can be created with an air spell , then using a fire spell will spew fire bolts all over the place			0
however , targeting your opponents gets a little tricky			0
players are supposed to aim higher for foes located on a higher level than @entity21 , but those shots do n't seem as consistent as level ones			1
unfortunately , the foes on ledges and stairs seem to have no problem raining down shots on you			0
also , when multiple foes start attacking , that flicking action can be a bit hard on the arm and shoulder			0
take frequent breaks or else suffer the aches later			0
the player will collect raw materials to make potions that restore health and enhance spell abilities			0
there is also treasure to be found , and it can be used to buy more materials for those potions			0
interestingly , once you create a potion and drink it , you never have to make that potion again			0
the only potions to be reused repeatedly are health potions , which can be bought or found but not created			0
the move controller creates the potions			2
you are asked to go through the motions of grinding berries , sprinkling dust or pouring a liquid into a cauldron , and then must stir using the wand controller to mix the ingredients together			2
despite being a role - playing game , there is no traditional " leveling up			2
" any advancement happens through the potions you create and quaff and the spells you find as the game progresses			2
the game 's dialogue is funny and spirited			1
there are plenty of quips and one - liners but unfortunately no chances for players to retort			2
the voice actors for @entity21 and @entity124 project real emotions into the characters and help the players feel empathic to their fears , their jokes and their hopes			1
" sorcery " should be the right game for the move controller , and in many ways , it is			1
the action flows well , the story is easy to follow and the characters are noteworthy			0
it is n't a very deep game , but as an introduction of sorts to @entity3 's move tech , it does n't have to be			1
" sorcery " is now available for the @entity145 , and only uses the @entity12 motion controller , navigation controller and eye camera			1
it is rated e 10 + for everyone 10 years of age and older due to fantasy violence , mild blood , and mild suggestive themes			0
this review was done using a provided retail copy for the @entity145 .			0

" sorcery " showcases the @entity12 's *capabilities*
the game is fun , but aiming with the controller is sometimes *imprecise*
the game features @entity21 , a sorcerer 's apprentice who must save a princess
it has fun dialogue but no chance for players to respond
