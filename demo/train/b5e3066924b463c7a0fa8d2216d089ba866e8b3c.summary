-- the @entity2 officer who responded last week to an emergency call about a runaway @entity4 described the driver as visibly shaking and said he " appeared to be in shock " once the car came to a stop , according to the police report released wednesday			1
the @entity4 ' driver , @entity10 , called 911 on march 8 after he said his accelerator became stuck as he tried to pass a slower vehicle			1
for about 20 minutes , @entity10 said , he was unable to gain control of the car as it reached speeds in excess of 90 mph on a winding , hilly portion of @entity20 outside of @entity21			1
he said he repeatedly pressing down on the brakes and trying to lift the gas pedal to no avail			0
in the police report , responding officer @entity25 said he " could smell the heated brakes which indicated they had been used extensively " and said he saw the brake lights periodically illuminate as he came upon the car			1
when he pulled alongside the car , " i could see the driver sat up off his seat indicating that he was possibly applying the brake pedal using his body weight			2
" he said the @entity4 slowed slightly -- down to about 85 mph -- before accelerating again to 95 mph , according to the report			2
" the driver looked over at me briefly and appeared to be in a panicked state , " @entity25 's report said			2
eventually , @entity25 used the patrol car 's public address system to instruct @entity10 to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time			2
that tactic worked , and he was able to stop the car			0
" the driver ... was visibly shaking and breathing deeply , " the report said			1
" he appeared to be in shock			0
" upon searching the car , @entity25 found " a large amount of brake dust and brake pad material in and around the wheels , " the report said			0
@entity4 technicians investigating the incident were unable to recreate the same condition , according to a draft congressional memo obtained earlier this week by @entity0			1
in addition , @entity10 ' claims that he slammed on the brake while his gas pedal was stuck to the floor do " not appear to be feasibly possible , " the memo said			0
@entity62 of @entity64 headquarters , described in the memo as @entity4 's residential hybrid expert , said that if the gas pedal of the car was stuck to the floor , and the driver applied the brake , the engine would shut down			1
the memo said before @entity10 ' vehicle could be tested , technicians had to replace rotors , brakes and pads , as the pads and rotors were worn down			0
