-- most of the wintry precipitation had moved on by monday night , but much of the @entity3 is likely to see white stuff on the ground until the weekend as an @entity7 low slides in , bringing low temperatures in the teens and highs barely out of the 20s			0
and a snow storm surging over the @entity13 and into the @entity14 promises to merge with the @entity16 storm tuesday night and slam into the @entity18 wednesday , according to the @entity19			1
the storm brought treacherous travel conditions across the @entity16 monday , with schools and government offices shut down from @entity23 to the @entity24			1
those conditions are n't expected to change overnight as temperatures remain below freezing , making morning commutes on tuesday no better			1
in @entity30 , airlines canceled hundreds of flights monday -- and plan to cancel more on tuesday			1
@entity33 spokesman @entity32 said the airline would begin operation " with a greatly reduced flight schedule " and warned that flights heading to the @entity38 would likely be affected at least through wednesday			0
@entity39 , which canceled almost a third of its flights across the country monday , said it planned at least 1,400 cancellations on tuesday			1
spokesman @entity44 said the airline was keeping a close eye on the @entity38 for late tuesday and early wednesday			1
both airlines were offering one - time flight changes with no fees for a limited period			0
and if air travel was limited , road travel was nearly non-existent			0
impassable roads were the norm across the region , although that did n't keep everyone at home -- particularly truckers trying to keep their schedules			1
and some of those truckers caused some of the problems			0
monday night in @entity30 , jackknifed tractor - trailers had blocked the east side of @entity66 , which encircles the city , from @entity68 on the south to @entity70 on the northeast			0
another had been stuck on fabled @entity73 in the city 's @entity75 district for hours			2
@entity78 emergency officials warned people to stay off the roads if at all possible from central @entity78 north			0
@entity30 police were dealing with so many accidents that the department announced it would only work accidents with injuries and provided an online form for drivers to report others			0
in @entity91 , traffic accidents claimed two lives , one in @entity93 and the other in @entity95			1
parts of the northern part of the state got 6 inches to 10 inches of snow , according to state @entity101 spokeswoman @entity100 , and three - fourths of the state received snow or ice			0
@entity108 emergency officials reported a single fatal traffic accident on sunday as sleet began moving into the state			1
no part of @entity113 was unaffected by the snows and ice , particularly the mountainous west where snowfalls of up to 18 inches were reported			2
@entity117 and @entity118 both expected freezing rain and sleet into tuesday morning			1
the @entity121 reported extremely hazardous conditions in the mountainous east , but ice and snow was also causing problems in other parts of the state			2

other areas reporting heavy accumulations were @entity140 , @entity117 ( 9 inches ) , @entity141 , @entity117 ( 7 inches ) , and @entity142 , @entity91 ( 7 inches )			1
@entity144 , @entity78 , and @entity140 , @entity118 , each reported 6 inches			2
reported power outages were relatively few early monday			2
about 2,300 homes in @entity130 and 4,000 in @entity108 lost power , according to authorities in those states , and power had been restored to most of them			1
nearly 2,000 @entity78 customers were out of power , according @entity154 , and @entity155 reported 3,000 customers out			2
but the snow brought out some revelers , too			0
in @entity161 , northwest of @entity30 , @entity160 's daughter @entity159 was bursting with anticipation of a whole day to play in the snow			0
" she 's been asking me every five minutes , ' did they close the schools ? ' " @entity160 said			0
in tiny @entity167 , east of @entity30 , the city closed its steepest street to vehicular traffic -- but left it open for sledding			2
it drew dozens of kids ( and adults ) for a slippery ride down the street , a long trudge back up -- to an open fire pit , s'mores and hot chocolate			0
most @entity30 students also will be staying home tuesday , as well , as the major school districts announced closings will stretch into another day , according to the @entity184			1
the situation was much the same in other metro areas along the storm 's route : most school districts near @entity190 , @entity91 ; @entity140 - @entity192 , @entity118 ; and @entity193 , @entity117 , will be closed tuesday , local media reported monday			1
as the storm pressed farther to the northeast monday , @entity194 and @entity195 went under winter storm warnings , while winter storm watches were in place in much of the @entity202 seaboard and @entity203			2
the @entity19 predicted 5 inches to 8 inches in the @entity205 area , 4 inches or more in northern @entity194 and 2 to 6 inches in southern @entity195 from tuesday afternoon into wednesday morning			2
in the @entity16 , the @entity19 expected a high approaching 40 on tuesday -- but the @entity7 front currently bringing snow into the @entity208 would sink into the south , without the precipitation but with frigid temperatures			1
while the snowstorm was a headache to drivers and businesses , it proved to be a help to police in one @entity78 town			0
officers investigating a pre-dawn burglary at a liquor store in @entity221 , @entity78 , simply followed a set of tracks in the otherwise undisturbed snow from the store to a nearby apartment complex			0
there , after knocking on the door where the footprints led , they found a pair of teenagers along with a backpack full of liquor bottles carrying stickers that matched bottles in the burglarized store			0
two young men were arrested and charged with burglary and criminal destruction of property			0
