-- surprise ! before she became @entity3 , @entity4 was apparently being courted to be a cast member on " @entity6			1
" on " @entity8 , " @entity7 -- @entity4 's co-star in " @entity10 " -- recalls hoping that he would be spending every saturday night with @entity4			1
" we wanted @entity4 to be on the show with us , " he said			1
" i remember being on the ninth floor where @entity15 ' office was , and seeing @entity4 come in			1
i was like , ' oh my @entity17 , there 's @entity4			1
is she about to be on our show ? ' " but no , apparently she was worried about " snl " being a " boys ' club " and so opted to go with " friends			2
" @entity7 was shocked ; " she said no ? she 's gon na do that ' friends ' ? what is ' friends ? ' " and thus , a million haircuts were launched			2
when it comes to iconic movies and tv show characters , it seems like the role could only have gone to one person			2
but the truth is that casting decisions are constantly in flux , depending on who studios want , what actors ' commitment schedules look like , and what price they demand			2
for example , did you know that @entity4 was also considered for @entity43 in " @entity44 " ? and to play @entity45 in " titanic " ? we found a few more casting close calls that would have set some very big stars ' lives careening in other directions			1
the @entity0 : 10 super sexy @entity53 spots 1			2
@entity54 said " no " to " @entity55 " @entity54 was apparently a little uneasy about being a sci - fi star			2
initially , he passed on his role in 1997 's " @entity58 " -- until @entity59 talked some sense into him			2
soon after , he was courted for a much more mind - bending thriller : " @entity63			2
" that 's right - he was the first choice to play @entity55 and only when he passed did it go to @entity67			1
but @entity54 is happy about how things turned out			1
" i would have absolutely messed up ' @entity63 , ' " he said			2
" at that point i was n't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be -- whereas @entity67 was			2
" instead , @entity54 did " @entity72			0
@entity73 lost his " @entity74 " paycheck speaking of " @entity63 , " the original choice to play @entity77 was @entity73			1
@entity73 , however , turned the role down and @entity79 eventually got the part			1
having apparently not learned anything , @entity73 also turned down the role of @entity83 in " @entity74 " trilogy because he " did n't understand the script			1
" @entity86 had supposedly offered him up to 15 percent of the box office take worldwide , which means this was a $ 400 million mistake			0
the @entity0 : 15 " what we 're they thinking " ugly tattoos on celebrities 3			0
@entity93 won her star role by being " awkward " @entity93 was so , so perfect as @entity95 in " @entity96			0
" but @entity97 came very close to being given the role			0
producer @entity99 explains , " we had someone looking for us in @entity102 and she said , ' there are two people you should see			0
' the first was @entity97 , who was 16 and emancipated			0
@entity108 wanted her , and i said , ' this girl is absolutely beautiful , but the @entity95 i see shivers back and forth between being beautiful and being really -- i mean , @entity97 , you know , this is a girl who has been told she 's beautiful since she 's 5 years old ! i just do n't think @entity95 's that girl			0
' then in walks @entity93			0
and at 13 , you know : from one angle , she 's breathtaking ; from another , she 's awkward			0
" if @entity97 had been cast , " clueless " may not have been nearly as brilliant			1
but then again , " @entity96 " might have lasted for more than a single season			0
@entity119 could have been " clueless " but " clueless			1
" guess who was originally wanted to play @entity123 ? @entity119			1
she had to turn it down because of her contract on " @entity126			1
" now to bring things full circle , @entity119 was also originally offered the role of @entity130 in @entity132 's " @entity131 " and again had to pass because of " @entity126			1
" the role , of course , went to @entity93			0
the @entity0 : best and worst cleavage at the 2011 @entity136 5			0
@entity137 changed @entity139 's future everyone remembers @entity139 as @entity141 in the classic delorean time machine tale , " @entity143			0
" but , he was not @entity144 and @entity146 's original choice for the movie			0
in fact , they filmed for five weeks with @entity137 in the lead role and decided to start over again because something was n't quite clicking			0
@entity152 owes @entity153 a mini-muffin basket @entity152 has @entity153 to thank for his career			1
@entity153 was the originally slated to play @entity156 in " @entity157 , " but turned down the offer			1
only then did @entity152 get a chance			0
@entity152 evidently won again in 1981 when @entity160 turned down the role of @entity162 in " @entity163 " just imagine - @entity162 might have had a serious moustache			1
the @entity0 : @entity165 as @entity166 ? 8 stars confess who they look like 7			0
@entity169 claimed @entity172 's @entity171 opp @entity169 won an @entity171 for her role in " @entity174			0
" but apparently , the role was originally offered to @entity176			1
in an alternate universe , @entity176 won her second @entity171 for the film and got divorced thanks to the evil @entity180 , while @entity169 is making rom - coms and is still married to @entity182			0
" @entity183 " @entity176 was second choice speaking of @entity176 , i can still picture her laughing in that red dress in " @entity183			0
" studio execs , however , had another lady in mind to play the classic hooker with a heart of gold			1
@entity192 apparently turned down the role because she was n't feeling the " tone of the script			1
" the @entity0 : 10 celebrity moms who love breastfeeding 9			0
" @entity199 " star lucked out @entity200 , who ? apparently , the makers of " @entity199 " were originally gunning for @entity203 for the role			2

@entity4 was considered for @entity43 in " @entity44 " and @entity45 in " @entity208 "
@entity153 was the originally slated to play @entity156 in " @entity157 "
@entity119 turned down " clueless " because of " @entity126 "
