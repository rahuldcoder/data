@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a voice alternating between desperate and hopeful , @entity4 talked to her daughter continuously tuesday afternoon through a window left ajar at the main military hospital in this southern @entity1 city			1
" @entity11 , give @entity12 another chance to love you , ok ? " she finally begged , sobbing			1
on the other side of the window , two - year - old @entity15 -- affectionately known as @entity11 -- lay almost lifeless in bed inside the intensive care unit , with netting around her head and a respirator covering her small face			0
the toddler was gravely injured in two successive hit - and - run incidents last thursday not far from her father 's hardware store in the nearby city of @entity28			2
when @entity2 visited the scene tuesday evening , the blood stains had long gone but two circled numbers on the ground made with black markers clearly indicated the locations of both collisions			0
@entity15 's condition remained critical , her brain showing little activity despite some earlier subtle movements in the lower body , her mother said			1
gruesome security camera footage of the accidents and the girl , lying in her own blood , ignored by more than a dozen passersby in a busy market has outraged the nation , stirring an emotional debate on the state of morality in a fast - changing society			0
on @entity55 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity56 , the story continued to be the no. 1 topic after generating more than 4.5 million posts along with a " stop apathy " online campaign			1
while the initial video went viral on @entity64 , state - run newspapers and television stations have since seized on the story , turning their spotlight on an unlikely hero as well as many villains			2
opinion : incident in @entity1 shows ' volunteer 's dilemma ' @entity72 , a 58 - year - old scavenger who was seen in the video moving @entity15 to safety , became an instant symbol of understated decency in a nation that many netizens say has become obsessed with climbing up the economic ladder			1
camera crews chased @entity72 for interviews , while local government and businesses fought to award her money			0
" i did n't think of anything at the time , " she told local reporters sunday			0
" i just wanted to save the girl			0
" @entity72 's overnight celebrity , however , appeared too overwhelming for her			2
her neighbors told @entity2 tuesday night she had gone home to the countryside with her son			0
domestic media also tracked down some of the passersby in the video			2
while several denied seeing @entity15 lie on the ground , one pedestrian told @entity103 that she noticed a girl crying next to a pool of blood			0
" i went to the closest store and asked a young man there if she was his child , but he said no , " the newspaper quoted her as saying			2
" nobody else dared to touch her , how did i ? " " this is sort of classic bystander effect , where people have a diffusion of responsibility , " @entity114 , a psychologist based in @entity115 , commented on @entity2			1
@entity15 's mother said in tears that she still could n't comprehend the behavior of the passersby but wanted to focus on the positive			1
" @entity128 represents the best of human nature , " @entity4 said of her daughter 's rescuer at the scene			1
" it 's the nicest and most natural side of us			2
" despite rising concerns over @entity1 's declining morality after the story broke , humanity now shines at the @entity0 hospital where @entity15 is being treated			1
a steady procession of well - wishers surrounds her family throughout the day , offering gifts , money and support			0
" i 'm so grateful for all the nice people , " @entity4 said			1
" @entity11 wo n't let them down			0
" i know my girl -- she 's strong and she 'll wake up again			0
