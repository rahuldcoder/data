@entity1 , @entity0 -- if your neighbor mentions their green roof you might think they have a moss problem			1
maybe they are simply referring to the color			0
but you 're unlikely to think that they have just had a mini ecosystem installed			0
@entity13 says green roofs can help alleviate the problems caused by storm water simply put , green roofs are gardens on your roof			1
they come in all shapes and sizes and range from a simple layer of turf to bite - sized hanging gardens of @entity25			0
but green roofs are not just aesthetic			1
they have important environmental benefits : they absorb storm water , reduce noise pollution , absorb heat ( thus lessening the urban heat - island effect ) and add an extra layer of insulation to buildings			0
that 's why they are increasingly being used on new builds as the construction industry looks to make use of greener technologies			0
. the concept of a green roof goes back centuries : the turf roofed dwellings of the @entity45 are early examples , but the modern green roof we know today was developed in @entity49 50 years ago			1
since then , they have become increasingly popular , yet the industry still struggles against skeptics , who believe green roofs to be expensive and liable to leaking			1
the exception to the rule has been @entity49 , where the industry is now annually worth $ 77 million			2
even by the end of the 1990s , 50 million square meters of @entity49 roofs , the equivalent of 10 percent of flat roofs , were recorded to be green			1
the industry is not faring so well in other parts of the world			0
while the @entity66 has seen a steady increase in interest since the 1960s , a lack of input from the industry and policy - makers has left @entity66 far behind @entity49 's booming market			1
in @entity72 , green roofs have taken even longer to catch on			1
@entity73 for @entity74 , a @entity75 non-profit industry association , conducted a survey in 2005 which indicated that only 233,000 square meters of green roofs existed in @entity72			1
but this was up 80 percent from the previous year , and the market continues to grow			2
@entity13 , who set up @entity79 to help lift the area out of poverty by creating green - collar jobs , is frustrated by this difference between the @entity85 and @entity86 industries			0
" in @entity49 they are down to $ 20 per square meter , which is way cheaper than a regular roof here , " she told @entity2			2
" there are mandates over there because of the storm water they retain , " she continued , " which is a huge drain on their resources , as it is on ours			0
what we are trying to do is champion the policies behind storm water			0
" storm water is a growing problem in cities			0
the lack of permeable surfaces are loading drainage systems and increasing the risk of flooding			0
it 's green roofs ' ability to retain high levels of precipitation that are seen as way to control and slow the water run - off			1
the mandates @entity122 refers to are part of @entity49 's @entity124 and @entity125			1
they are not a legal requirement , but through incentives set up at a city level , the mandates have helped to encourage cheaper prices			0
@entity132 , co-founder of @entity133 , a @entity66 web site promoting the green roof industry , believes it is the government 's responsibility to help the industry grow			1
" we need government bodies to accept certain civil engineering benefits , such as storm water amelioration , like the @entity49 , @entity143 and @entity144 do , " he told @entity2			2
" this will encourage uptake			0
" in many countries , the green roof industry is vulnerable to non-acceptance and a lack of understanding			1
@entity132 says , " there are problems with the construction industry viewing vegetation as a problem and not a benefit			0
" green roofs also struggle against better - known technologies such as solar panels , but @entity132 points out , " solar panels can work better on green roofs than on gray roofs			1
" despite this lack of support , the green roof industry is growing			1
in @entity1 alone , there are approximately 1 million square meters of green roofs planned , with about 200,000 square meters already installed			2
and as climate change stays in the headlines , the popularity of green roofs is growing			1
according to @entity132 , " over the last eight years , green roofs [ in the @entity66 ] have gone from being a very marginal approach to a mainstream approach			2
cities such as @entity1 and @entity175 are now asking for them as part of planning applications			0
" but @entity132 also believes that support from local government , as opposed to a centrally driven policy , is key to the industry 's growth			2
" in @entity144 , green roofs are federal law , but again this is interpreted at a cantonal and city level , " he told @entity2			2
" this is a much better approach than driven by the center			0
" managing the industry through federal laws offers a general framework which can then be interpreted as needed			0
in an industry that varies from project to project , this flexibility is a valuable asset			0
so the green roof industry continues to grow -- but there 's a feeling that government support could be better			1
with a little more encouragement , what once was an eccentric way to roof your home could soon become the universal standard , turning our cities into lush , green metropolises			2
but then , it 's not easy being green			2

. would you put a green roof on your home ? do green roofs really help the environment -- or are they an expensive indulgence ? share your views in the @entity220 box below .			1

green roofs date back to before the time of the @entity45
not just aesthetic , they help fight against climate change , especially in cities
@entity49 's green roof market is the *biggest* , making up 10 percent of all flat roofs
supporters say government support is need to spur growth elsewhere
