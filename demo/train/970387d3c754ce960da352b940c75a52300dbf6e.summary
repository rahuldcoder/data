@entity0 -- the images could n't have been better if @entity3 designed them himself			2
after months of leveling humiliating criticism at the @entity6 prime minister , here was president @entity8 calling @entity3 a man of peace , speaking of the " unbreakable " bond between the @entity12 and @entity6 and essentially giving @entity6 a green light to skirt transparency in its suspected nuclear program , citing its " unique security requirements			1
" gone were the bitter recriminations and the harsh demands to stop all settlement activity in the @entity20			0
instead there was praise for the @entity6 government for " working through layers of various governmental entities and jurisdiction " and showing " restraint " over the past several months			0
to put an even finer point on the fact that the recent tension was a thing of the past and the two leaders were once again bosom buddies ( actually , they never were , but they seem to be now ) , @entity8 even walked @entity3 to his car after the meeting			1
the images were a marked contrast to @entity3 's last visit in march			1
then , there was no press conference or even a photo - op , and it was widely viewed as a snub after the @entity6 announcement of new settlement plans for mostly @entity47 @entity46 during vice president @entity49 's visit to @entity6			1
the new message of unity made clear that the relationship between the @entity12 and @entity6 , and that of their two leaders , was back on track			1
it was the culmination of a new narrative months in the making			0
as he did with @entity60 president @entity59 , @entity8 found his " tough love " approach toward @entity3 was proving counterproductive			2
the @entity12 push for a new @entity66 resolution on @entity67 , @entity8 's recent signing of legislation imposing fresh @entity12 sanctions against @entity71 and his administration 's efforts to push back pressure for an international investigation into the @entity77 flotilla raid , which killed nine @entity78 , all helped to mend fences with @entity6			1
@entity3 's delegation left @entity0 satisfied that @entity8 understands @entity6 's security needs			1
but beyond the change in tone evident for the cameras lies a series of contentious issues the @entity12 and @entity6 will have to confront over the next several months			1
the details of what happens next are murky and could lead to renewed tensions in the fall when the 10 - month freeze on settlement construction in the @entity20 ends			0
both leaders agreed on the need to move from so - called " proximity talks , " essentially consisting of shuttle diplomacy by @entity8 's @entity98 envoy @entity97 , to direct talks			2
but the conundrum is that @entity102 president @entity101 has refused to restart direct talks without a full settlement freeze , while @entity3 is resisting extending the existing ban until talks start			0
@entity8 set a deadline when he said talks should begin before the freeze ends in september , suggesting it could create a climate of trust building " in which everybody feels a greater investment in success			0
" the leaders also spoke of " confidence - building measures " both the @entity6 and the @entity117 could take to create a better atmosphere for direct talks			0
@entity8 wants @entity6 to " widen the scope " of @entity102 security control in the @entity20 beyond the current few cities , citing advances made by @entity101 and prime minister @entity123			1
but it is unclear @entity6 is confident enough to expand @entity102 responsibilities			0
@entity8 went out on a limb tuesday , saying unequivocally that he trusts @entity3			2
the assumption is that he must have gotten some assurances in private from @entity3 about steps he is willing to take			0
but it was clear from @entity3 's remarks that the peace process is n't issue no. 1 for him			1
@entity8 administration officials before the meeting , and @entity8 himself during his press availability with @entity3 , emphasized that moving to direct talks was the most important issue on the agenda			2
but in @entity3 's remarks , the peace process rated a distant third to @entity67 and issues of @entity6 's security			1
if direct talks do n't begin soon , experts believe the possibility of a breakthrough becomes less likely			0
the @entity117 are almost certain to refuse to sit down if the settlement freeze is not extended			0
and as the @entity12 midterm elections approach , @entity3 could gamble on @entity152 making gains and weakening @entity8 's hand			1
@entity3 himself is facing domestic hurdles , which make playing for time in his best interests			0
the hope is that tuesday 's summit enabled the leaders to build a partnership which can help them move forward on the peace process			2
the proof of that will come at the first bump on the rocky road to september , when daylight appears between these two new best friends .			0
