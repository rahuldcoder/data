-- @entity1 remembers the deep gut pain she felt when she found out nearly three years ago that @entity3 had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a @entity5 rebel group in @entity6 that had abducted and killed her missionary husband			1
the pain remains , but @entity1 felt some relief last week when a federal judge rejected @entity3 's motion to dismiss a damage suit she and four other widows brought against the @entity15 - based company			1
" my stomach still turns today at the thought of fellow @entity18 paying terrorists , " @entity1 said			0
" it just makes my stomach sick			0
" @entity3 , which has admitted making payments to the rebels and was fined $ 25 million by the @entity23 , says it was victimized			1
" @entity3 acquiesced to extortion payments to protect the lives of its employees , " company spokesman @entity24 said			1
to some analysts , the issue highlights the difficulties of conducting business in war - torn areas			0
@entity5 guerrillas who call themselves the @entity34 of @entity6 , commonly known as @entity35 , declared war on the government in 1964			1
@entity3 had more than 200 banana farms in @entity6 before selling them in 2004			1
" it 's really tough doing business in an environment that is lawless and the state is largely absent , " said @entity40 , professor of international studies at the @entity42			2
for @entity1 , though , the issue is deeply personal			0
she had been married to @entity48 for 3½ years when @entity35 rebels burst into their home in @entity51 , @entity52 , across the border from @entity6 , on january 31 , 1993			1
the rebels abducted @entity48 while his wife and two daughters -- ages 11 months and 2½ years -- watched in horror			2
the @entity35 abducted two other members of the @entity60 around the same time and demanded a $ 5 million ransom for the three men about a week later			0
one year later , the rebels abducted two other missionaries belonging to the same @entity66 group			2
a $ 3 million ransom was demanded for their release			0
no ransom was paid for any of them			0
the families did not know anything about their loved ones for years			0
it was a tough time for @entity1 's daughters			2
" they went through all of their growing - up years that they can remember asking where their daddy was and if he could come home for their birthdays , " @entity1 said			0
she and the wives of the other men abducted in 1993 found out the truth in december 2000 , when @entity60 officials told them the @entity35 had killed the three captives in 1996			0
the @entity6 government confirmed the deaths in february 2007			1
the two men who were abducted in 1994 were killed during a firefight between the @entity35 and the @entity6 military in june 1995			1
evidence and eyewitness reports obtained by the @entity98 and the @entity23 confirmed that the @entity35 executed the missionaries			0
the @entity100 designated the @entity35 a foreign terrorist organization on october 8 , 1997			0
the five widows found out another hurtful truth in march 2007 , when @entity3 pleaded guilty to violating @entity18 antiterrorism laws by providing payments to another @entity6 terrorist organization , the paramilitary right - wing @entity102 , known as the @entity102			1
@entity3 made more than 100 payments to the @entity102 totaling at least $ 1.7 million , the @entity23 said			1
as part of those proceedings , @entity3 acknowledged that it had also made payments to the @entity35 from 1989 to at least 1997			1
that period included the span during which the five missionaries were abducted and killed			0
that knowledge still pains @entity1			0
" i just can hardly stand to think about it too much , " she said			0
" they 're like a household name			1
you feel like you can trust them			0
" it 's just horrible to think about			1
" @entity3 's @entity24 said the company 's sole motivation was to protect the lives of its employees			1
he cited a 1995 incident in which a bus transporting @entity3 employees was attacked and 25 people aboard it died			2
in total , he said , more than 50 @entity3 employees were killed in @entity6 in the 1990s			1
" we 're sympathetic to the families , " he said , " but @entity3 was being extorted by right - wing groups and left - wing groups			1
there was a very real fear , a very real threat to @entity18 citizens			0
" that argument does not wash with @entity142 , an attorney for the families			0
" there 's no law that says you have to operate in areas where you have to pay terrorists , " @entity142 said			2
" that 's something they chose to do			2
" @entity1 , a 40 - year - old kindergarten teacher at a church school near @entity151 , @entity152 , filed suit in march 2008			2
civil provisions of the @entity18 anti-terrorism @entity155 allow @entity18 citizens , their heirs and their estates to be paid compensation for injuries suffered as a result of international terrorism			0
the families " allege that @entity3 , knowing that @entity35 was a terrorist organization , intentionally agreed to provide money , weapons and services to it as part of a common scheme to subvert local trade unions , protect @entity3 's farms and shipments , harm @entity3 's competitors , [ and ] strengthen @entity35 's military capabilities , and that [ the families ] were injured by overt acts done in furtherance of the common scheme , " @entity18 district judge @entity163 wrote in his 34 - page ruling allowing the suit to go forward			1
court records show that @entity3 initially made monthly cash payments to the @entity35 ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 100,000			1
eventually , @entity3 's payments were fixed to a percentage of the company 's gross revenues from its @entity6 banana business			1
ultimately , up to 10 percent of those revenues were diverted to the @entity35			0
the company also supplied weapons , ammunition and other supplies to the rebels , the victims ' families allege			2
the families also said " @entity3 went to great lengths to hide its relationship with @entity35 , " @entity163 noted in the february 4 ruling			2
" the payments were often delivered by a former @entity18 military pilot known as ' @entity204 , ' who held a management position with @entity3 in @entity6 , " the judge said the families allege			1
according to the families , @entity163 said , @entity3 placed false names and nonexistent employees on its payroll , providing the money on local paydays to regional @entity35 commanders			2
the company also helped the @entity35 create front organizations to which @entity3 could channel money , the victims ' families said			1
in addition , the judge said , the families accuse @entity3 of working with @entity35 - controlled labor unions as another way to channel payments to the guerrillas			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity24 and one of the company 's attorneys , @entity225 , declined to discuss friday whether the families ' allegations noted by @entity163 are factual			1
the judge 's ruling means the case can go to the discovery phase , in which each party can obtain documents and evidence from the other side			2
" we needed to pass this hurdle in order to go forward , " said @entity237 , another attorney for the families			0
@entity24 expressed confidence that the company will be exonerated			0
" it makes no sense to make @entity3 or @entity3 employees liable for the horrible crimes that those groups committed , " @entity24 said			1
@entity250 , the attorney for the other side , " @entity3 is intent on defending what we consider the indefensible			2
" no amount for monetary damages has been asked , @entity142 and @entity237 said			0
@entity1 , who has remarried , says she has a reason beyond dollars and cents			0
" all those years of not knowing if he was alive or dead , " she said			0
" there never has been any closure			0

@entity3 admitted making payments to @entity6 rebels
" they 're like a household name . *...* it 's just horrible to think about , " widow says
