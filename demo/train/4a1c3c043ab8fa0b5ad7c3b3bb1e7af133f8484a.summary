-- for @entity3 , the onset of " @entity2 " meant one thing : a lot of waiting			1
" i waited eagerly for them to arrive in the @entity7 " she said			1
" i waited for them appear on ' @entity9 , ' for each album , for my concert tickets , for the concert , for class to end so i could listen to my @entity15 records			1
they were worth the wait			0
" the @entity18 resident was a freshman at @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , on february 9 , 1964 , the night @entity15 made their first appearance on " the @entity23			1
" " a group of us went to a professor 's house to watch , " she recalled			0
the band performed on the variety show for three consecutive sundays , and @entity30 dutifully tuned in each time			0
" they were cute , funny and talented , " she gushed			0
of course , @entity30 did n't just watch @entity15 on tv and listen to their records at home			1
on september 3 , 1964 , she and a friend joined the throngs of other @entity15 fans at a concert in @entity18			1
" we were in the nosebleed section at the @entity41 and barely heard a note for the screaming , " @entity30 remembered			0
" the amplifiers were very small by today 's standards			0
" she still has the ticket and photos from that day			0
those screaming fans were just the beginning			0
the @entity15 ' arrival in the @entity7 -- 50 years ago next month -- marked the start of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity57 's history - making path of pop culture dominance			1
more on " the @entity59 : the @entity60 " ' i had it and i lived it ' for @entity65 , @entity15 ' " @entity9 " appearance marked the beginning of an obsession that lives on today			1
her home in @entity69 houses a massive collection of memorabilia , including all the original albums , the script of their film " @entity75 , " ( which she saw eight times upon its initial release ) , collectible @entity15 dolls , and a @entity15 poster from " 16 " magazine			1
she remembers the early days of " @entity2 " as " magical for me and millions of other teenage girls			1
" " we all watched the ' @entity23 ' on our black and white tv sets and fell in love with their music , youthful energy and appearance			0
looking back they were very clean - cut looking , but our parents did n't think so ! " @entity92 grew up in a small town in @entity94 , where she said it was difficult to listen to the latest music			0
" my brother rigged up a wire from his bedroom window across the creek behind our house so we could pick up the @entity104 on an old shortwave radio , " she remembered			0
" he was also in a band and when they would rehearse down in our basement i would sit on the steps and pretend they were @entity15 rehearsing ! " and friday nights meant " @entity15 sleepovers " for @entity92 and her friends , when they would listen to @entity15 albums and daydream for hours			1
" talk about @entity2 , i had it and lived it			1
" the next year , she took the opportunity to see the quartet perform in person			0
she traveled by bus the long distance from @entity94 to @entity124 to see @entity15 perform what would become a legendary concert in @entity127 on august 15 , 1965			1
" it was a very hot , humid evening with thousands in the audience all chanting ' @entity130 , oh yes we do ' while waiting , " @entity65 said			1
" when @entity15 ran out onto the field , the sound in the stadium was incredible , with over 55,000 screaming teenagers , myself included			1
" " it was an amazing feeling seeing them			0
none of us knew it would be an historic concert ; we were just caught up in the moment seeing @entity15			1
" by that point , @entity15 ' popularity " across the pond " had made its way to other countries around the world , showing just how much of a cultural touchstone that february concert would become			2
@entity2 spreads worldwide living in @entity152 , @entity153 , in 1964 , @entity151 was just as crazy about @entity15 as her @entity7 counterparts			1
one of her most treasured memories is opening a pack of bubble gum and finding a photo of the " @entity15 " themselves			2
the surprise caused quite a commotion among her siblings but her mother was n't quite as pleased			0
stamp remembers her mother telling her to calm down " and stop being so crazy over these young boys			0
" she did n't approve of their long hair			0
despite her mother 's feelings , @entity169 , then 14 , quickly plastic - wrapped her photo of the @entity15 and displayed it on her bedroom wall until she left home two years later			1
" since then , it has become a special piece of memorabilia that i hold close to my heart , " said stamp			2
" it represents a piece of my childhood , and that is priceless			0
" @entity2 did n't just affect women			2
@entity184 of @entity185 , @entity186 , became a @entity15 fan in 1963 and is still one today ; he attended a @entity189 concert as recently as 2009			1
at age 12 , and knowing very little @entity191 , he stood transfixed one day in the schoolyard while hearing a song			0
it turned out to be @entity15 ' " she loves you			2
he and a friend found it in a music booth at a record store ; he listened to it 25 times and learned the lyrics by heart			2
after listening to many of their records , @entity184 said @entity15 taught him how to speak @entity208			1
" the lyrics got more sophisticated and so did our vocabulary , " he said			0
@entity184 said he " almost fainted " when hearing the lyrics , " @entity213 , there is a barber showing photographs / of every head he 's had the pleasure to know			2
" @entity184 , a management consultant , credits the @entity15 for his success in life			1
" now many years later i have lived in eight different countries and professionally traveled the world			2
i got the jobs because during interviews my @entity208 was superior to other @entity186			1
" meanwhile in @entity226 , " @entity15 changed everything : @entity228 lives and music , " according to @entity230 of @entity231			1
@entity230 explained that @entity2 influenced how young people behaved in @entity226 in the early 1960s			2
" the boys let their hair grow longer " and began to form rock bands , she said			0
girls started to wear miniskirts , boots and attended parties without chaperones for the first time			0
" adults and adolescents used to dance ' merengues ' and ' boleros ' with the @entity247 's @entity246 , a famous @entity226 latin music orchestra , but since @entity2 , adolescents wanted to dance to rock more than anything else , " @entity230 recalled			2
" parties started to be different , since the music was different , and in a way part of our identity changed			0
" of course , there were also the ever - present @entity15 posters in her room			2
although they were thousands of miles away , @entity261 ' teenage memories sound identical to the ones that @entity92 and others described			0
" my bedroom was the meeting location to hang out and listen to their fabulous music that marked our lives forever , " she said			0
