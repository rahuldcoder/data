@entity0 , @entity1 -- a manual recount of votes is n't possible in @entity1 , the head of the country 's @entity4 said wednesday , suggesting there is no legal basis for the opposition 's push for a ballot - by - ballot audit of the narrow presidential election results			1
in nationally televised remarks , @entity1 chief justice @entity14 said @entity1 's 1999 constitution eliminated manual recounts in favor of a " system audit			1
" " in @entity1 the electoral system is completely automated			0
therefore , a manual count does not exist			2
anyone who thought that could really happen has been deceived , " she said			0
" the majority of those who are asking for a manual count know it and are clear about it			2
elections are not audited ballot by ballot but through the system			0
" her comments came a day after the sounds of clanking pots and pans and bursting fireworks rang out in @entity0 as tensions mounted over @entity1 's tight election results			1
it was a clear sign that days after sunday 's presidential vote , fierce political battles are far from over in the deeply divided country			0
supporters of opposition candidate @entity47 banged pots and pans to protest the government 's refusal to recount the votes , while supporters of president - elect @entity53 set off fireworks to celebrate his victory and drown out the noise			1
@entity53 , the late president @entity57 's handpicked successor , is scheduled to be sworn in on friday			1
election authorities proclaimed him president - elect on monday despite @entity47 ' demand for a recount			2
@entity1 's state - run @entity63 news agency said at least eight people had been killed in post-election violence across the country			1

the issue of post-election clashes swiftly has become a flashpoint for a new round of political sparring , as @entity47 repeated his calls for a recount and @entity53 vowed to use an iron fist to crack down on any attempts to unseat him from the presidency			1
analysis : why @entity1 is so divided ? @entity47 ' repeated demands for a recount have left key questions about @entity1 's future unanswered : will @entity53 's supporters stick behind him ? will tension in the deeply divided country boil over after the tight race ? and will world leaders recognize the results ? @entity118 secretary of state @entity117 said wednesday that he could not say if he would recognize @entity53 as the president - elect or not			1
