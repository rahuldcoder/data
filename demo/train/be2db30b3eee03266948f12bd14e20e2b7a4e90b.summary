-- last week offered a grim parade of perspectives on the nature of terror and danger in the @entity6 and in the modern world			1
the @entity9 bombings , the @entity11 fertilizer plant explosion , the earthquake in @entity13 , to name but a few			0
but the week also offered a glimpse of the way we have come to understand violent acts that affect us : here in the @entity6 we observe a hierarchy of terror			1
it works like this : the media and seemingly the rest of the @entity6 public care most when a terrorist is successful , foreign , @entity26 , and thus resonant with what has become the touchstone of our views on terror : 9/11			1
for such cases , no coverage or government action is too excessive			0
we care when casualty tolls , as measured in @entity6 lives , are high and the villain is easy to point a camera at , easy to fit into our predetermined definition of what a villain is ( see point 1			1
) when the terrorist is a crank or is unsuccessful , we care less			1
when the terror happens to @entity45 or @entity46 or others far from us , we care less			1
when the terror is not perpetrated by an individual but is perhaps the result of the actions or inactions of a company , a government body , a special interest group or nature , our concern does not approach the level it does when there is a bad guy , a foreign connection , an experience that recalls earlier terror experiences ( no matter how tenuous )			1
there has been an extraordinary panoply of tragedies in the past week on which to test this theory			0
on monday we witnessed in horror the attack on the @entity9			0
within a day we learned of ricin - laced letters targeting members of the @entity72 and later in the week , the president himself			1
by wednesday afternoon , the perpetrator in the letter attacks was arrested			0
around 8 p.m. that evening , an explosion at a fertilizer plant in @entity11 devastated a town of 2,800 , killing 14 and injuring 200 others			0
by thursday evening , the manhunt for the @entity83 bombers had resulted in the identification of the two bombers , the gruesome end of one of them and , sadly , the death of another victim , a 26 - year - old @entity91 police officer			2
this news rocked us , but it should also have been put into perspective by events elsewhere			0
the same day as the @entity9 attack , scores of ordinary people were killed in coordinated terror bombings across @entity45			2
on saturday , an earthquake rocked @entity100 province in @entity13 , injuring at least 11,000 people and producing a death toll that at this writing was approaching 200			2
on sunday alone the violence that tears daily at @entity46 left more than 500 people dead , most in a single town			1
finally , while @entity6 was galvanized by the swift action of authorities in responding to the @entity9 attacks , we also saw midweek starkly contrasting government inaction in the face of a much bigger threat : that posed by gun violence in @entity6			1
more than three times as many @entity6 will die in gun homicides this year as died on 9/11 and more than 10 times as many will die of gun violence of one sort or another			2
yet , the @entity72 demonstrated this week that it does not see this as a problem of any great urgency			2
truly , it appears not all terror is created equal			0
but this is not all we 've learned about terror this past week			0
we saw anew that we can not ever eliminate its threat , but that when cities react calmly and with courage , the impact of attacks can be limited and the goal of the terrorist to produce mayhem can be defeated			0
and we saw in the well - trained first responders , effective mail screening facilities and impressively swift law enforcement pursuit of wrongdoers that the investment we have made in preparation has paid off			0
the @entity83 attack has also compelled us to consider terror 's hidden costs			1
in debating whether or not to read @entity143 his @entity145 rights and in shutting down an entire city in search of a single 19 - year - old , we brushed up again against debates that have raged throughout this past decade			0
what is a proportional response to terror ? when would it be better to treat a threat as a criminal matter to be handled within our basic system of laws and when should it be treated more aggressivelyâ € ” even to the point of suspending basic elements of due process , as in the suggestion by some to treat @entity143 as an enemy combatant ? or do we do damage to our national reputation and character as we did in the decade past with the contra - constitutional provisions of the @entity167 or our actions at @entity169 or @entity170 ? in short , once again we must ask , how much damage are we doing to ourselves in our efforts to stay safe or pursue justice ? @entity174 and terrorists are real and their stories are compelling , but we ought to remember that by far the biggest threats we face come from elsewhereâ € ” from what might be corporate negligence or greed ; from natural disasters or the heedless abuse of the environment ; from people who find it far too easy to get their hands on guns or from leaders who twist their interpretation of the @entity190 to overreact to one threat even while ignoring and exacerbating another			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			2

@entity194 : reaction to recent disasters shows people in @entity6 follow hierarchy of terror
he says they care when terrorist is successful , foreign , @entity26 and strikes @entity6
he says we *overlook* danger likely to affect us , like @entity72 inaction on guns , @entity46 *slaughter*
@entity194 : @entity83 made us weigh our *priorities* in handling terror , such as due process
