@entity0 -- @entity2 was silent friday as a week of massive street protests engulfed the streets of @entity5 and other @entity7 cities			1
neither officials from prime minister @entity10 's office nor the @entity2 foreign ministry offered any public comment on the growing political instability in @entity2 's most important regional ally			0
after the first day of @entity5 street protests on tuesday , @entity2 @entity16 member @entity15 , known as the @entity2 politician with the closest ties to @entity7 president @entity19 , told @entity21 that he did not believe the demonstrations would bring down the regime for lack of a viable leadership in the opposition			1
" there is no leading figure that can lead the wave of protests till the regime falls , " he said			0
" this is not a regime of one person , but it is backed by the army , the intelligence agencies and the secret service			0
it was an assessment shared by more than a few @entity2 analysts and government officials , but by friday night , underscoring just how rapidly events were moving , @entity38 affairs analysts for the two major @entity2 television networks were talking about the possibility of @entity19 being forced from power			1
while the relationship between @entity2 and @entity7 is frequently described as a " cold peace , " the two countries maintain significant intelligence and security ties			2
