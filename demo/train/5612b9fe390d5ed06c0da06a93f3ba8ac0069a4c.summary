-- on sunday , during the inauguration ceremony , and followed by endorsement of the @entity5 ayatollah @entity4 , @entity6 president , @entity1 presented @entity7 [ the @entity6 parliament ] with a list of proposed cabinet members			1
a look at candidates shows that after eight years of the chaotic and catastrophic presidency of @entity15 , things are getting back to normal			2
this could also mean that the old guard is in charge again			2
senior ruling elites ( the average age of @entity1 's new cabinet is 57 ) are celebrating their victory after surviving @entity15 pressures to uproot them			1

a close aide to @entity1 , @entity33 , wrote on his public @entity35 page : " this cabinet has been designed to return peace to the government of the country			1
the presence of veterans indicates difficult crisis that must be resolved			0
it takes at least two years to find out what in the past eight years has caused this country to fall apart			0
" the economic orientation of the new administration is clear			0
the appointment of @entity49 -- head of @entity6 's @entity51 -- as the presidential chief of staff , sends the message that the new government will be relying on the private sector			1
and the composition of the cabinet seemingly shows @entity6 liberals will be at the helm of the economy			1
however , there is still speculation about the political proportions of the new administration			0
a mistake that many political critics make is trying to determine the political weight of the cabinet based on the overused dichotomy of principlist - reformist , neglecting that such a categorization can no longer describe the political arena of @entity6 , particularly in the post-election era			1
read more : @entity1 feels limits of office now , let 's look at a few facts			1
all 18 proposed ministers have good relations with @entity79 , the head of the @entity80 who became known as the kingmaker in this election			1
some of these candidates are even considered @entity79 's apostles			2
sixteen of them have held prominent positions in the administration of @entity90 , the former reformist president who is out of favor with the hardliners and was not even invited to @entity1 's inauguration			1
more interestingly three of these proposed ministers , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , were three of the most important members of the @entity100 campaign in 2009			1
( this candidate is still under house arrest with his wife after protesting the vote result and leading the @entity105 )			0
naturally such a makeup of the cabinet drew criticism from the radicals in the principlists ' camp			2
but more interestingly , radical reformists , particularly the activist and journalist body associated with them , have criticized @entity1 for his cabinet picks			1
why ? because the position of the three sensitive ministries of culture , intelligence and interior were not given to pure reformists			1
the @entity122 was offered to @entity123 -- the son of 87 - year - old head of the @entity126 @entity125 -- who unlike his father has good relations with @entity79 and during the presidency of @entity90 was @entity6 's ambassador to @entity131			1
in an interview conducted less than a week ago he uttered almost everything that a reformist would say			2
@entity125 said he did not believe in censorship before publication of books			0
censoring has been the standard procedure in the past three decades of publication in @entity6			2
he also promised that if a newspaper criticizes the administration it would not land in hot water			0
read more : presidential elections without buzz despite being a principlist , @entity148 , the candidate minister of intelligence has mostly trodden his own path			0
less than two years ago he was disqualified from running for @entity7 by the @entity126 for " lacking practical commitment to @entity152 and the regime			0
" in a recent interview , @entity148 had the courage to openly say " there is a security atmosphere in the country at present and individuals are not at ease to speak [ their minds ] " and promised that the situation would change			0
unlike the candidates for culture and intelligence ministries , @entity166 , the proposed interior minister whose job description includes appointing the 31 governors , has not revealed his view points			0
a principlist , @entity166 is very close to the speaker of @entity7 , @entity172			0
therefore , many radical reformists have criticized @entity1 for giving a share in his cabinet to @entity172			1
an unofficial campaign has also started lambasting the speaker of @entity7 as the sole obstacle to reforms in the country			0
it appears that certain political currents in @entity6 are repeated like short cycles			2
about 12 years ago , the reformists launched a campaign against @entity79 and his cohorts including @entity1 to blame him for all the country 's problems in order to prevent his election to the sixth parliament			1
demonizing @entity79 actually turned out to hurt reformists most as they lost a powerful ally , who could have helped them in furthering their agenda and paved the way for the victory of @entity15 in the 2005 election			1
portraying @entity172 as the new wicked could have similar sequels			0
@entity172 has already shown that he wants a relationship based on give and take			0
in the aftermath of the 2009 presidential election , despite pressure by hardliners to condemn popular protests , he remained silent as long as he could			0
in the beginning , he even tried mediating between the defeated candidate @entity100 and the supreme leader			0
it is only natural for the new president whose campaign slogan was " solving things with prudency " to choose negotiation to strengthen the position of his camp instead of resorting to confrontation and exclusion			0
the boldest step @entity1 has taken is nominating @entity219 as foreign minister			2
@entity219 's candidacy has been heavily opposed by the hardliners who insist this choice means that the new administration is serious about reducing tensions with the @entity226 , particularly with the @entity227 some have claimed that @entity1 's cabinet does not create strong hope of a political opening in @entity6			1
but the reality is that the winds of change began blowing two months ago immediately after the election by the republication of two highly circulated reformist magazines that had been banned			0
and even though @entity90 was not allowed to attend the inauguration ceremony , his pictures have once again found their way to the front page of the newspapers			2
however , it appears that the threat of the radicalization of the supporters of change is stronger for the new administration than the pressure from extremists			0
two weeks ago , one of the most prominent anti-regime figures in the country , 81 - year - old @entity249 -- who has been sentenced to eight years in prison -- stressed in an interview with a reformist paper that @entity1 's administration should not be expected to perform miracles : " he has to arrange the melody of desired change with the increasing tolerance and endurance levels of the opponents of reform , " he said			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267			2

president @entity1 has presented @entity6 's parliament with a proposed cabinet list
@entity267 says it suggests a return to the old guard , after @entity15
16 proposed ministers had positions in the government of reformist @entity90
however , three key posts were not given to pure reformists , @entity267 says
