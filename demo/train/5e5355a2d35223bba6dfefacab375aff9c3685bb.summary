-- @entity1 spent the weekend celebrating a first @entity3 triumph after a dramatic defeat of @entity5 , but the @entity8 club 's record signing @entity9 was far from happy for the majority of saturday 's historic win			1
the @entity12 was left out of the starting lineup for the clash at the @entity17 team 's @entity15 , with @entity1 's interim coach @entity18 deciding to play @entity19 forward @entity20 alone in attack			1
@entity23 's decision paid dividends , as @entity20 scored @entity1 's 89th - minute equalizer in the 1 - 1 draw before converting the winning penalty in a nail - biting shootout			1
@entity29 , who has struggled for form since joining @entity1 from @entity31 in a @entity33 - record $ 80 million deal in january 2011 , described being on the bench for @entity37 club football 's most important match as " perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life			1
" @entity41 mourns as @entity5 blow big chance " i thought i would play in this game and i could n't imagine not doing so , " the 28 - year - old , who was introduced as an 82nd - minute substitute once @entity5 had taken a 1 - 0 lead through @entity46 , told @entity48 journalist @entity47			2
" but in the end i could participate and offer the team something			0
" @entity9 scored just six league goals last season , although he did enjoy a productive end of the campaign after netting a hat - trick against @entity58 and the decisive goal in @entity1 's @entity3 semifinal victory over @entity61			1
despite @entity9 ' important contribution at @entity61 's @entity64 stadium , @entity20 has been @entity23 's preferred striker in @entity1 's recent important matches			1
@entity1 parade @entity3 trophy @entity9 was also on the bench for the @entity72 club 's @entity70 final win over his former club @entity31			1
" there have been a lot of ups and downs , " he said			0
" there have been many times when i 've felt lost , i was not sure what to do			0
i felt like i did n't know where i belonged			0
" this season i have felt things that i never had before			0
i 've felt like they treated me in a way that i did n't expect , not in the way that was spoken of when they signed me			0
" we 've had a lot of talks and we 'll talk about my future at the end of the season because the role i 've had this season is not for me , nor is it the one i expected to play when i came here			0
" the next goal for @entity9 is to be included in @entity96 's squad for the forthcoming @entity97 in @entity98 and @entity99 , with coach @entity100 set to name his 23 - man squad on may 27			2
@entity9 scored the winning goal as @entity96 beat @entity103 in the final of the 2008 tournament in @entity106 and @entity107 , but his inability to cement a place in @entity1 's team has cast doubt over his international future			1
the former @entity114 striker has been included in the world champion 's squad for the upcoming friendly matches against @entity118 and @entity119 , along with @entity1 teammate @entity120			2
" i 'll be hoping to be on the list when it is announced , " he said			0
" i feel better than ever , hungrier than ever , but that 's what football is like -- often , when you feel you 're at your best they do n't consider you			0
" meanwhile , saturday 's final attracted the attention of some very powerful spectators across the @entity131			0
at a @entity134 at @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity133 president @entity132 took in the action alongside @entity33 prime minister @entity138 and @entity17 chancellor @entity139			1
it was @entity138 who ended the match the happier , but the two @entity37 leaders were able to embrace at the climax of a thrilling final .			2

@entity9 disappointed after being on the bench for @entity3 final
striker @entity20 was preferred ahead of the @entity12 for the match in @entity41
@entity1 's record signing says he will *reevaluate* his future at the club
