-- oppressed by war and poverty for generations , the @entity1 have struggled with terrible hardships			2
but the people of this vast country have a narrow window of hope to achieve progress by ridding both their nation and the world of a horrible disease forever			1
with support from @entity15 and others in one small targeted area where cases remain , @entity19 -- the last stand for @entity13 -- could quickly eliminate this parasitic infection contracted from contaminated drinking water			2
guinea worm victims endure the horror of a thin worm , up to 3 feet ( 1 meter ) long , emerging slowly through a burning blister in their skin over the course of about a month after the parasite has incubated inside them for a year			1
this can be stopped by educating people to filter all drinking water and to stay out of water sources when they have a worm emerging to keep it from discharging new larvae back into the water			2
click to see guinea worm disease : then and now because the worm requires a human host , it is within our control to eradicate it			1
poised to become only the second disease eradicated from @entity46 besides smallpox -- which had different challenges -- guinea worm cases have been reduced from about 3.5 million in 20 nations in 1986 to about 3,200 in 2009			1
eighty - six percent of remaining cases in the world are in @entity19 , where violence continues to threaten the population and health workers			2
the few other cases are in @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
i recently returned to @entity19 to visit an endemic guinea worm village and met with ministers of health from @entity64 and @entity19 , who are assisted in their guinea worm eradication effort primarily by @entity15 and other partners , including the @entity67 , @entity68 , and the @entity69			1
@entity19 has reduced its cases by 98 percent since the eradication program began there in 1995 , and we expect even greater reductions in 2010			2
but continuing insecurity is a major concern			0
in 2009 , @entity77 worm workers were forced at least 32 times to remain in their homes or offices or had to be evacuated temporarily because of violence or threatened violence , and areas affected by violence reported at least half of all cases last year			0
the greatest periods of progress have been when violence abated -- during a cease - fire lasting almost six months that i negotiated between @entity64 and @entity19 in 1995 to initiate the guinea worm program there , and since the 2005 @entity92			1
also challenging is the slow pace of providing safe drinking water in endemic villages , only 16 percent of which have even one safe water source			0
the campaign has hinged on providing cloth filters , health education , and a mild insecticide to kill the parasite in water			0
this has been effective in bringing us to the brink of eradication , albeit slowly			0
but wherever possible , creating new sources of clean groundwater can accelerate elimination , with the added benefit of preventing many other water - based maladies			0
this is just one example of how investing in disease prevention and eradication can strengthen the foundation for progress in developing nations			0
across @entity120 , guinea worm eradication workers have blazed new trails to prevent the disease in remote villages			1
likewise , networks of thousands of volunteer health care workers have been created to identify cases , deliver cloth water filters , and ensure that their infected neighbors do not step into a water source			0
they form the backbone of a rudimentary health care delivery system that is both low cost and effective in fighting other diseases , too			0
a war waged to vanquish the fiery serpent no one is working harder to eradicate guinea worm disease than the @entity1 themselves			1
@entity19 has a corps of more than 13,500 passionate and dedicated volunteer health workers -- foot soldiers of guinea worm eradication under the very capable direction of the @entity19 @entity144 and supported by 41 @entity1 and expatriate technical assistants from @entity15			1
whatever the outcome of april 's national elections in @entity19 and the referendum on national unity in @entity19 next january , ridding their nation of guinea worm disease will show the world what @entity19 @entity1 can do when they are not distracted by war			1
this will be an important victory for @entity19 and the world			2
with a little more help from their global neighbors , this achievement could be within reach very soon .			0
