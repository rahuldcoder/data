-- how are fads started and spread ? do certain influential people play a key role , or is it truly random ? how does a trend go from new and exciting to old and passe so quickly ? does having happy friends have an effect on our own happiness ? maybe @entity10 can tell us			1
every second , millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140 - character messages using @entity10			1
the " tweets " range from the mundane to the profound , and convey , for example , what people are doing , thinking and reading at any moment			0
the amount of information in any individual tweet is highly variable , but in aggregate the more than 65 million tweets composed per day represent a detailed , real - time trace of the collective thoughts and feelings of a significant fraction of the population -- potentially offering valuable information to everyone from politicians to advertisers to social researchers			1
to demonstrate the unique power of @entity10 data , our research group at @entity40 and @entity41 recently began a study to infer the mood of @entity10 users in the @entity47 from their public tweets			1
we can observe very distinct patterns over the course of the day , as well as weekly patterns that match conventional wisdom , such as the tendency of users to write happier tweets on weekends			2
we also observe geographic variations , with users from @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 , for example , using happier words in their tweets			1
with @entity10 , we now not only know which users are communicating , but we also know what they are saying			1
from a research perspective , @entity10 is more than just a new tool ; it 's an entirely new kind of tool			1
never before have academic researchers had access to this much real - time public information about what people are thinking and saying			0
it is analogous to being allowed to tap into millions of water - cooler conversations , school rooms and other public conversations across the globe			0
our study is preliminary ; we need more data to do a proper evaluation , and the results are subject to any number of biases ( people using language differently across the @entity47 , and different demographics using @entity10 at different times )			1
our approach simply looks , for example , for occurrences of " happy " or " unhappy " words in tweets			1
however , because we take words out of context , our approach will not correctly interpret tweets like " i am not happy "			1
even so , initial results demonstrate that @entity10 data contain a wealth of information , and that even relatively simplistic approaches such as ours can extract interesting results			2
in fact , other research groups have also begun to examine @entity10 data and have demonstrated that it can be used to predict the box - office success of an upcoming movie			2
and @entity10 data yields much more detailed polling when compared to traditional methods , enabling real - time feedback for issues that are of local , national or international interest			2
in the past , researchers studying traces of human communication , such as phone records , have shown that the social network that connects us has rich hidden complexity			0
but legal and privacy concerns have caused these previous studies to almost universally omit the content of the communication			0
because most users leave their tweets public , @entity10 represents an unprecedented opportunity			1
this is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to @entity10 for its policy of open access to public tweets ( exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the @entity141 )			2
like any scientific tool , the ability to use the data for research is subject to caveats and limitations			0
unlike many existing tools , such as surveys and polls , researchers can not ask a question of the @entity10 users directly ; instead , researchers must determine whether the question is one that the @entity10 data can answer			1
should we determine how to extract information reliably , which we 're working on , the potential applications of the data are almost endless			0
for example , monitoring the mood of the public chatter on @entity10 could allow businesses to quickly identify and respond to incidents , mitigating the effect of negative publicity on their brand			2
the data could be used to inform public policy , allowing public officials and politicians to receive feedback from their constituents in real time			0
from a scientific standpoint , @entity10 data can shed light on how information spreads through society			0
researchers can also investigate network effects : how does what our friends discuss influence what we discuss ? in short , the data that is now becoming available from @entity10 and related websites offers a new lens through which we can view society			0
it promises new approaches to understanding social phenomena , what some colleagues have dubbed " computational social science			0
" this new kind of data presents new challenges , such as privacy , anonymity and legality , but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0
