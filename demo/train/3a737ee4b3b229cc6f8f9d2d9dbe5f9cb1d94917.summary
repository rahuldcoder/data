-- life is good for @entity3 a decade after surviving a hellish kidnapping , she told @entity0 's @entity5			1
@entity6 got married last year and her book " @entity9 " is expected to be a best - seller			1
" it could n't get better than that , right ? i 've got great dogs			2
i 've got a great family			2
i mean , i could n't be happier , " @entity6 said in the second installment of her interview , which aired tuesday on @entity0 's " @entity5 360			1
" the first installment shown monday detailed the night of june 5 , 2002 , when @entity19 dragged her from her family 's @entity22 home with a knife to her throat , threatening to kill her and her family if she made a noise			1
@entity6 , now 25 , is a long way from the scared 14 - year - old who spent nine months as a captive of a homeless street preacher , who raped her daily , and his wife , @entity33 , who treated her like a slave			1
" that happened to me , but i 'm so much more than that girl that was kidnapped , " @entity6 told @entity5			1
when @entity6 testified at @entity19 's federal trial three years ago , it was to help prosecutors convict her kidnapper			1
but her book is intended to raise awareness of sexual abuse and to help other victims , she said			2
@entity3 's story : nine months of what ifs and near misses paralyzed by fear she had chances to be rescued , but the fear that @entity19 might carry out his threats to kill her and her family paralyzed her , she said			1
one missed opportunity came when someone told police they saw the missing girl at a @entity22 library			2
when homicide detective @entity62 approached to investigate , @entity6 was sitting next to @entity33			1
" as soon as the policeman flashed his badge , because he was just dressed as a civilian , she immediately clamped her hand down onto my leg , and in my 14 - year - old mind , i just knew that if i did anything or said anything that i would be killed and then they 'd go after my family , " @entity6 said			1
" so , i sat there just praying and hoping and just desperate that he 'd recognize me , that somehow he 'd save me			0
" @entity19 refused to let the detective see under the veil that shielded @entity6 's face , saying it violated their religious beliefs for anyone but the young woman 's husband to see her face			1
" when he turned around and walked away , being 100 % convinced that it was n't me , i mean , it felt like i was being kidnapped all over again , " @entity6 said			1
" i mean , it felt like i was being stolen from my family again and being ripped away from my life and my happiness			0
" manipulating her kidnappers @entity19 and @entity33 took @entity6 to @entity94 soon after that encounter , but they were also talking about heading to @entity97 or @entity98 , she said			1
" we have to get back to @entity22 , " she told @entity5 she was thinking			1
" there 's no way anyone was going to find me if i do n't			2
but there 's every reason for them not to want to go back to @entity22 , every reason in the world for that to be the last place for them to ever go			2
" she used her own psychological trick to persuade @entity19 , who was so good at manipulating others , to return to @entity22 , she said			0
" i remember turning around and facing my captors and just telling them , ' i just have this feeling and i know that @entity116 would never speak to me , but i know he 'll speak to you because you 're his servant			0
you 're practically his best friend			0
could you please ask him if we 're supposed to go back to @entity22 , because this feeling , it just wo n't leave me and , this is just crazy coming from me , but if you ask him i know he 'll tell you			0
' and so he did end up asking			0
and that was how it was decided we 'd go back to @entity22			0
" her rescue soon after their return -- on march 12 , 2003 -- police officers confronted them outside a @entity132 store in @entity133 , @entity134			2
" i remembered all these cars pulled up and then the policemen jumped out of their cars and they came over and surrounded us and started asking questions , " @entity6 said			1
" and my two captors , they kept giving the answers and the officers started to ask me questions			0
" she had been prepared by @entity19 with a back story in such cases , she said			0
" i started giving those answers , because they were standing right next to me			0
" but her courage grew when the police separated her from @entity19 and @entity33			0
" at first , i was still really scared , " she said			0
" i kept giving the answers that i had been told to give , and then finally one of the officers said , ' well , if you 're @entity3 , your family misses you so much and they love you so much and they have never given up hope on you the entire nine months you 're gone			2
do n't you want to go back home to your family ? ' and it was just at that point that i felt like , well , no matter what the consequences are , i do n't care , i want to go home			0
" " so what did you say ? " @entity5 asked			1
" i told them that i was @entity3 , " she said			0
" what was that feeling like to say your name ? you probably had n't said your name for a long time , " @entity5 said			1
" it was scary because i did n't know if they thought i had done something wrong or if they had thought i had run away , " she said			0
" i did n't know what they were thinking			0
" one lesson to be learned from her story is that public speculation -- the armchair quarterbacking by people who do not know the facts -- can be hurtful to a victim			2
" to have so many people speculate on what happened and what i must be going through , and just so many lies being told , " she said			0
i did n't like it			0
i do n't think anybody likes having people guess at what they 're going through			0
privacy is so sacred and any time a victim is returned , a survivor is found and rescued , privacy is one of the greatest gifts we can give them because if they decide to share , that 's up to them and they will come forward			1
