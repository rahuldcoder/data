he 's an unemployed former @entity3 footballer who is desperate to resume his playing career			0
but while several clubs have signaled their interest in offering convicted rapist @entity9 a second chance , public opinion in @entity6 is proving an almost insurmountable stumbling block for the 26 - year - old			1
since his release from prison after serving half of a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old girl , debate has raged as to whether @entity9 should be allowed to resurrect a high - profile career within the sport			1
even the leader of the @entity23 -- the @entity6 's main opposition political group -- has weighed into the debate , asking whether a sporting role model should be offered a contract by a club			0
after being spurned by former club @entity31 , fourth tier @entity29 is the latest to be thrust into an unwanted spotlight after contemplating hiring him			0
more than 27,000 people have put their names to a petition calling on the club not to sign him in the space of 24 hours , with @entity40 forced into a series of crisis meetings to further examine the issues			1
the club released a statement on monday saying it still had n't reached a decision and would " continue to have conversations with representative bodies ... and will conduct due diligence with regard to any decision we make on this matter			2
" @entity9 , who started his career with current @entity3 champions @entity55 , has maintained his innocence throughout and is awaiting the outcome of a @entity59 inquiry into his sentence			1
but his future in the game could hang on the outcome of @entity40 's investigations			1
should they turn him down , the former @entity66 international would be further away from the playing field than ever			0
@entity40 might be in two minds , but public and political opinion , appears not to be			1
the leader of the @entity23 , @entity72 , the local member of parliament for @entity73 and @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity77 's @entity76 , @entity78 have all come out against the move			0
" i believe it would be wrong for @entity9 to return to playing football for @entity29 or any other club , as he has been convicted of rape , a violent crime for which he has neither apologized or acknowledged , " @entity75 said in a statement			1
" it would send out an entirely inappropriate message to young fans and victims of sex crimes for him to be signed by @entity40 or anyone			1
" it 's very much a case of history repeating itself for @entity9			1
clamor from the public derailed a plan for him to be allowed to train with @entity31 , in @entity101 soccer 's third tier , after the club said reaction to its decision " has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated			0
" over 165,000 people signed a petition urging @entity31 to cut ties with him while @entity111 heptathlon champion @entity110 told the club she wanted her name removed from one of the stands at its stadium should @entity9 play for it again			1
her decision drew praise from the @entity6 prime minister @entity120 , who said he " understood " why one of the stars of 2012 's @entity111 opposed @entity9 ' return to her local club			2
@entity9 ' official website states his belief that his conviction was a " gross miscarriage of justice " and underlines his commitment to quashing the verdict			2
it is this standpoint , allied to the perceived prestige and financial rewards that come with being a professional footballer that has helped fuel such a fevered response to @entity9 ' place in the game , according to lawyer and @entity143 agent @entity142			2
" a lot of the backlash has been over the fact that he 's not accepted his guilt , despite having served his sentence , " she told @entity1 shortly after his release			2
" but where does it say that a convicted criminal , who has served their time , can not go out to work ? " i think people are angry because normally a lot of the criminals who are sent to prison , once they 've served their sentence in relation to a heinous crime , have to start from scratch trying to get employment			2
" but this is a young lad who has committed a crime , never admitted his guilt , and despite that , he comes out of prison and walks into a job which is so well paid			0
" after being rebuffed by @entity31 , the manager of lowly @entity173 -- currently rock bottom of @entity101 's fourth tier -- expressed an interest in signing @entity9			1
the town 's @entity177 , @entity179 , labeled @entity9 a " pariah " during his call for @entity173 to steer clear			1
and the club moved quickly to dismiss the speculation , saying it understood the concerns of its supporters and the general public			0
@entity188 club @entity187 were another club to reportedly contemplate handing @entity9 a deal but that move was effectively ruled out when the @entity6 's @entity191 emphasized its laws on convicted sex offenders working abroad			2
" we are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders , to stop them re-offending and to protect victims , " it said in a statement			0
" probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings -- this effectively rules out working abroad			0
" as @entity9 adjusts to his new status as a footballing pariah , @entity40 must feel a certain sense of déjà vu			1
it signed @entity213 in 2007 after the striker had served three years in prison for being found guilty of causing the death of @entity217 through dangerous driving			0
the trial of @entity213 , who once played in the @entity3 for @entity221 , heard how he crashed into another car carrying the father of four when traveling on the wrong side of the road and then fled the scene			0
despite the furore , @entity213 spent two seasons with @entity40 before going on to represent three other league clubs			1
it is n't just football that has had to deal with the focus that comes with offenders being reintroduced to sport			0
former world heavyweight champion @entity235 returned to boxing after three years in jail for the rape of 18 - year - old @entity239 , making millions in the process			0
prior to @entity40 's board prolonging its deliberations , one of its sponsors -- @entity245 -- confirmed it would end its agreement with the club if they signed @entity9			1
" the club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow @entity9 to train we will be out of the door , " director @entity253 was quoted as saying by the @entity6 @entity254			1
the issue continued to be discussed at the highest levels of @entity6 politics , too			0
@entity23 leader @entity72 told the @entity259 : " i think that it is right @entity40 are thinking again about whether @entity9 should be hired by them because you are a role model , he 's been convicted of a very serious crime			1
" personally , if i was in their shoes , he has n't shown remorse and i would n't take him on			0
" those sentiments were echoed by @entity77 's @entity272 , who said : " @entity9 is a convicted rapist and , whilst i strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation , it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract			2
" all offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence , but @entity9 ' lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offense means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a @entity77 football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model , especially to young people			1
" the only person from @entity40 to speak on the matter on monday was the team 's manager @entity291 , who was besieged by cameras when he arrived at the club 's stadium			2
" it 's a very difficult situation , " he told reporters			0
" i do n't really want to comment			0
of course we want what 's best for the club -- whatever the board decides			0
