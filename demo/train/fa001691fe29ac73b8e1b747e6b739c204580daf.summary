-- dr. @entity1 knows first hand how @entity4 's regime works			2
he says the seeds of his opposition were sown when he was age 10			2
he and classmates were taken to witness the public execution of a political opponent of @entity4			0
" they hung him up in front of thousands of small kids , " @entity1 said			0
" he did that to scare people			0
" @entity1 , who taught physics at @entity18 , later fled to @entity19			0
the prominent member of the @entity21 now lives in @entity22 , and anticipates the group could become an important player in a @entity26 environment			1
as in @entity28 and @entity29 , the @entity21 in @entity27 has been energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the @entity32 world			1
it says it has no organizational links with the @entity21 elsewhere , but shares the philosophy of the @entity38 @entity37 movement founded in @entity28 in the 1920s			1
largely drawn from the devout educated middle classes and university campuses in @entity42 and @entity43 , the @entity21 was founded in the mid- 1950s			1
@entity37 opposition to the @entity46 regime gathered force in the late 1980s , as part of a wider @entity50 awakening or " @entity56 " in the region and in reaction to what many saw as an attempt by @entity4 to hijack and interpret @entity50 for his own purposes			0
while jihadists launched a brief but unsuccessful campaign to overthrow @entity4 in the 1990s , the @entity21 focused much of its efforts on clandestine preaching and social welfare efforts in @entity62 in 1998 , @entity4 's security services launched a crackdown against the group that saw more than 200 members imprisoned and hundreds more forced into exile , including @entity1			1
despite years of repression , @entity1 claims the @entity21 still has thousands of members scattered across @entity27 , with chapters in almost every single town , including @entity72 , @entity4 's birthplace on the coast west of @entity42			1
in 2006 , its leaders were released after reconciling with the @entity46 regime			0
but now the @entity21 is siding with the rebellion			1
in february , as protests in @entity27 began , @entity76 -- an @entity28 preacher in @entity77 widely viewed as the @entity21 's chief spiritual guide -- issued a fatwa or religious ruling obliging any @entity46 soldier who had the opportunity to do so to assassinate the leader			1
@entity85 , a leading figure in the @entity21 and the president of the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) recently traveled to @entity43 , the headquarters of the rebel movement , according to @entity1			1
other @entity21 exiles have returned to help treat the wounded in hospitals , according to @entity93 , the @entity28 founder of the @entity95 association			1
there is little or no overt presence of the @entity21 in @entity43 , according to @entity0 's @entity98 , who has been there for most of the month			1
but in the longer term , in a country where the political space has been dominated by @entity4 for more than 40 years , the @entity21 's organization and nationwide presence may afford it an advantage			1
the @entity106 has nothing to fear from the @entity21 in @entity27 , according to @entity1			1
like their counterparts in @entity28 , they would embrace multiparty democracy			0
" i 've lived for many years in @entity19 and the @entity95 , and that 's exactly the political system that we want , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 says that if his organization forms a political party , it would seek to legislate according to @entity118 principles , which would include , for example , a continued ban on the sale of alcohol			0
" why should n't we be able to press our point of view -- we are humans too , " he said			0
@entity1 said the @entity21 welcomes airstrikes in @entity27 , a startling turnaround for a movement that previously supported jihad by @entity129 against @entity131 forces occupying @entity129			1
" i salute and am very grateful to the @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity95 governments for stopping the killing , " he said			0
" i will never forget this			0
" @entity1 said he hopes a @entity27 will be a close friend to the @entity106			2
a more prominent role for the @entity21 in @entity27 could dent support for @entity139 and other jihadist groups , especially in eastern provinces that have witnessed significant radicalization in recent years			1
but @entity27 's deeply tribal structures -- unlike @entity28 and @entity29 -- may complicate its efforts to build a national base			2
and hardline " @entity147 " preachers have gained influence in neglected towns like @entity150 -- on the coast near the border with @entity28			0
" conservative imams ( in @entity150 ) , " a @entity131 diplomat wrote in 2008 , " deliberately sought to eliminate the few social activities on offer for young people to monopolize the social and cultural environment			0
" but in the end , the reach of the @entity21 may be most limited by the emergence of secular forces at the forefront of the rebel movement			2
the @entity166 in @entity43 -- a 30 - member opposition leadership -- is mostly made up of lawyers , doctors , intellectuals and former political prisoners with a secular bent			2
in a statement monday , the @entity166 stated the ultimate goal of the revolution was " to build a constitutional democratic civil state based on the rule of law , respect for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens including ... equal opportunities between men and women and the promotion of women empowerment			0
" @entity188 , a @entity46 academic based in the @entity95 who has emerged as a key liaison between the @entity46 opposition overseas and the @entity192 said no @entity21 leaders had yet been appointed to the @entity166 , and played down their influence			2
@entity1 , the long - time @entity21 member , expects that to change			2
" we 've been working secretly till this moment , " he said .			0
