-- @entity2 's shining star @entity1 has been rapped over the knuckles and " told to take more care " when riding his bike by the sport 's organisers			1
running away with the @entity9 in his debut season , the 20 - year - old @entity8 has been handed a penalty point and his @entity12 docked their points scored for @entity1 's @entity15 victory following his collision with teammate @entity17			1
the pair had been scrapping for second place in the race two weekends ago when @entity1 made contact with @entity17 after misjudging the braking point at @entity23			1
it broke a sensor cable on his fellow @entity8 's rear wheel and eventually led to @entity17 crashing out of the race			2
the latest punishment takes @entity1 to three penalty points this season as part of a points system that was introduced at the end of last year			1
should the @entity8 pick up another penalty , he will have to start the next grand prix from the back of the grid			0
the penalty was dished out following a half - hour meeting with race direction , both riders and team management at the @entity43 , which will host sunday 's @entity44			0
" we are sending a message to @entity1 , very clearly , " said race director @entity45			0
" we understand that he is an extremely talented rider but he is also intelligent enough to understand there has to be some margin for error -- especially , as we have seen a number of times this year , under braking when the rider behind has the responsibility of not getting too close to the rider in front who is riding his own lines			0
" for us , that is a signal ( even though the contact itself was quite minor ) to make a formal warning by way of a penalty point to @entity1 to say he has to take more care			2
" @entity12 boss @entity65 admitted the team penalty was down to what was considered a safety lapse -- the failure of their traction - control system and the back - up unit , which , along with contact with @entity1 , caused the @entity17 crash			1
" we need to think about it and see whether we have to make an appeal or not , " said @entity65			2
as for the @entity1 penalty , @entity65 added : " @entity1 has been penalized with one point on his license			1
" that means there is no consequence for this race			0
basically , they said that in this case it was more or less ok but they are taking @entity1 's whole season into consideration and he has been close to touching the rider in front of him on more than one occasion			0
" the message was basically , ' this time it was ok but realize that you have been doing this quite often '			0
