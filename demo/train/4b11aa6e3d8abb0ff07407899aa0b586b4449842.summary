-- in a significant first , a @entity2 appeals court has struck down a state ban on same - sex marriage , creating greater political and legal momentum for the @entity6 to decide whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to wed. it happened on wednesday in @entity11 , where a panel ruled 2 - 1 against the prohibition , saying that any couple , regardless of sexual orientation , has the right to marry			1
enforcement of the decision was stayed temporarily			0
" we hold that the @entity22 protects the fundamental right to marry , establish a family , raise children , and enjoy the full protection of a state 's marital laws , " the majority opinion from the 10th @entity20 said			2
" a state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons , or refuse to recognize their marriage , based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union , " the court said			2
@entity11 attorney general @entity38 said his office would appeal to the @entity6			1
the justices then would decide whether to hear the case			0
@entity42 , a key plaintiff in the case along with his partner , @entity45 , said they were " overjoyed " by the ruling			0
" since the lawsuit was filed last year , we have received so much support from so many people in our state , and we are now looking forward to the day when we will finally be married , " he said			0
the legal , social , and political conversation over expanding the definition of marriage that is playing out in @entity11 is by no means unique , but merely another thread of an issue that is being confronted in courtrooms and living rooms nationwide			2
same - sex marriage is legal in the @entity61 and 19 states : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity61			1
@entity71 was the first to make it legal , in 2004			0
a recent @entity83 survey found that among metro areas with a population above 1 million , @entity84 had the nation 's highest rate of same - sex couples raising children , at 26 %			2
@entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were not far behind			0
among states , @entity95 led the list , also at 26 %			0
when it was passed in 2004 , @entity11 's prop 3 , which banned same - sex marriage , had 66 % voter support			1
but that has since fallen			0
a @entity103 poll has found residents there equally divided on whether same - sex couples should be allowed to get state - issued marriage licenses			2
unclear is whether the @entity11 appeals court decision would also apply to the other five states within its jurisdiction in the @entity112 and @entity113			1
@entity115 's same - sex marriage ban was also before it			1
enforcement of the @entity11 ruling was also stayed to give the state time to explore its legal options			0
it means same - sex couples in @entity11 can not get married for the time being			2
but in the meantime , @entity123 , clerk and recorder for @entity125 , @entity126 , said wednesday that she would begin issuing same - sex marriage licenses			1
" because the @entity6 stayed its mandate , officials in @entity11 will not have to implement the decision immediately			2
even so , i believe the opinion is clear and it is important to act immediately			0
" @entity126 's prohibition on same - sex marriage has treated our family , friends and co-workers as second class citizens for long enough			1
unless a @entity6 in @entity126 or the @entity2 @entity6 tells me otherwise , i plan to begin issuing licenses , " she said in a statement			0
@entity126 's attorney general stressed that the state 's prohibition on same - sex marriages remains in effect			1
in his statement , @entity149 said that any marriage licenses issued to such couples before a final resolution would be invalid			0
" there might be a bump in the road along the way ... the state may challenge this , " said @entity158 , who married her partner of 18 years on wednesday			0
standing beside their license , she added : " i think this will actually mean what it says it means down the road , " @entity0 affiliate @entity162 reported			0
wednesday 's decision also spells further legal limbo for 1,300 @entity11 couples who were legally wed when a federal judge first struck down the state 's ban in late december			1
those marriage licenses were issued for a 17 - day period before the @entity6 agreed with @entity11 officials to temporarily halt further marriages while the issue was appealed			1
@entity11 's senior senator , @entity178 , a @entity179 , expressed disappointment in wednesday 's ruling			0
" although i am not surprised by today 's decision , i disagree with the court 's reasoning and hope the @entity6 ultimately adheres to the original understanding of the @entity186 and allows each state to define marriage for itself , " said @entity178			1
but lawyers for the three same - sex couples who first filed the lawsuit challenging @entity11 's ban said the issue was simple			1
" if you boil it down from all of the legal rhetoric , it really comes down to fundamental principles of equality and fairness , " said @entity194 , a @entity84 attorney who argued the case before the appeals court			2
" i am genuinely hopeful that the @entity6 will take this case and resolve this issue and declare it 's unconstitutional			0
" the @entity11 decision and one by a federal district judge in @entity208 striking down that state 's ban , came a year and a day after notable @entity6 rulings on the issue			1
a 5 - 4 majority struck down a federal law known as the @entity215 , which had denied legally married same - sex couples the same federal benefits , including tax breaks , available to heterosexual couples			0
the court , also 5 - 4 , dismissed a same - sex marriage appeal on jurisdictional grounds , ruling that private parties do not have " standing " to defend @entity63 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
the ruling cleared the way for same - sex marriages there to resume .			1
