-- a police chief who allegedly used a false identity to buy as many as 192 houses in cities in @entity6 's southern province of @entity7 has sparked outrage on social media amid a growing scandal over corrupt officials amassing fortunes on the inflated property market			1
@entity15 , a senior police official in @entity16 in the southern province of @entity7 , had been accused by a local businessman of using a fake @entity19 on company documents to acquire the properties , the @entity14 reported			1
" a police official openly had two ids and used the other one to do business and cheat others			0
why ( does ) nobody probe the case ? " local businessman @entity27 was quoted as saying on state - run @entity28			0
@entity15 acknowledged possessing double ids - known as hukou in @entity6 - but denied having 192 houses , @entity31 reported			1
he was reported in @entity6 media as saying that he was managing the properties on behalf of his younger brother			0
authorities told @entity31 that @entity15 -- who is also a local @entity39 official -- had had the fake @entity19 revoked and that he had been dismissed from his post			0
the case has drawn a sharp response on @entity6 's lively social media			2
" ( @entity47 ) finally realized that in @entity6 , properties are forever in the hands of a tiny number of people , " a user of @entity6 's @entity46 - like @entity45 was reported as saying			1
the case follows other high - profile instances of high - ranking officials using fake ids and their positions to speculate on @entity6 's overheated property market			1
on monday , police arrested @entity59 -- a bank official from a rural bank in @entity6 -- who allegedly built a real estate empire worth at least $ 160 million using fake ids and graft			2
dubbed " @entity64 " in the @entity6 media , @entity59 allegedly used three false national identity cards to buy 45 properties in three cities , 41 of which were in @entity69 where @entity6 's expanding property bubble is at its hottest			1
the high - profile cases have captured the public imagination in a country where national identity cards limit the number of apartments a person can own -- part of a policy to cool @entity6 's rampant property market			1
the use of fake ids also points to corruption among the police who issue the cards , and authorities have detained four police officers on suspicion of helping @entity59 obtain the cards , the @entity81 said			0
there are fears the abuse of hukou - which registers a person place of residence in @entity6 - and the @entity19 system may hamper the government 's fight against corruption			2
" it could also provide the chance for officials fleeing abroad to use a passport registered with a fake id card			0
officials , with their real identities , have to hold official passports that would leave behind records for police , " @entity106 , a police officer from the city of @entity109 's public security bureau , told the @entity110			0
the cases have also highlighted the precarious role of construction which has come to dominate @entity6 's economy , accounting for roughly 25 % of all activity and 15 % of all jobs			1
the injection of stimulus money following the 2008 financial crisis has led to the rise of newly built ghost cities -- satellite cities built without thought for any sustainable market -- as stimulus money finds its way into construction			0
analysts say that more worrying still has been the rapid expansion of @entity6 's shadow banking system			2
unorthodox loans , which often come in the form of trust loans and so - called wealth management products , have gone into fund real estate development and have been criticized for having short maturities that are difficult to roll over during times of financial stress .			0
