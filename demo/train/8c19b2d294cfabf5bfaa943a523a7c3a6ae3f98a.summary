@entity0 -- political newcomer @entity2 is betting big on his own run for @entity4			2
the first - time candidate believes so strongly in the need for a new brand of leaders in @entity0 that , after careful consideration with his wife , he 's cashed in a large chunk of his 401 ( k ) in order to invest $ 100,000 in his campaign			1
" it 's not nearly enough to win , but it 's enough to get started , " he said			0
" it takes a lot of money to run for office , but that 's what it takes and like any businessman or whatever , you have to do what the job takes			1
" a traffic engineer by trade , @entity2 is running for a @entity31 seat in @entity33 's 11th @entity32			1
if he wins the @entity35 primary set to take place in june , he 'll take on two - term democrat @entity37			2
his campaign 's central issue is the national debt			0
" i am terribly concerned about what our congressmen are doing to this country with the debt , and we have to make a change , " he told participants at a @entity43 breakfast last week in @entity44 , @entity33 , where he was seeking signatures to get on the ballot			0
" it 's only a few years before everything is going to collapse just like it did in @entity55 and unfortunately , we do n't have anyone to bail us out			0
" while government spending is @entity2 's chief concern , as a candidate he 'll have to worry about a different kind of spending : his own campaign 's			2
it 's getting more and more expensive to run for political office			0
" the cost of seeking office whether it 's for state legislature or a governorship or a member of the @entity31 or @entity75 , these costs have been going up for decades , " said @entity65 , a senior fellow at the @entity66 who studies elections and campaign finance issues			1
" it 's kind of amusing to look back say to the 1970s , and you 'll find many members of @entity4 then were spending , oh , $ 75,000 , $ 100,000 , $ 200,000 -- now that would almost be a rounding error			2
" long odds in 2010 , the average winning @entity31 candidate spent about $ 1.4 million , according to the @entity83			1
that 's 70 % more than a decade ago			1
the average price for winning a @entity75 seat reached nearly $ 10 million in that cycle			1
the high cost of running for federal office often puts newcomers facing well - known incumbents -- who often have more financial backing from supporters and political parties -- at a substantial disadvantage			2
" there 's always an instinct on the part of incumbent members -- incumbent office holders -- to build a war chest even if they may not need to use a penny of it , and as a consequence challengers , those who are trying to break through for the first time , face an increasingly daunting challenge in raising enough money to get themselves known , " @entity65 said			1
" there 's not much room , not much opportunity for ordinary folks of modest income and wealth hoping to break into politics			0
it 's a costly business			0
it 's a highly competitive business and they face long odds			0
gen. @entity122 , a first - time candidate who 's running in @entity33 's 10th @entity32 , is hoping to beat those odds			1
the former @entity124 general and one - time assistant @entity126 secretary was an active supporter of @entity127 and later @entity128 during the 2008 presidential race , and he was recruited by the @entity130 last year to run against @entity35 @entity131 , who 's been in the @entity31 for more than three decades			1
" i think that right now our country desperately needs leadership in the @entity4			0
i think particularly the @entity31 is in a stalemate right now , " @entity122 said , after a morning spent making fundraising calls from the kitchen of his farm house in @entity140 , @entity33			1
" i think i can add something to the national debate on where our country should be going			0
i think we are kind of at a tipping point			0
when i was asked by the party to consider running , i could n't say no. " @entity122 has been a long - time advocate of early childhood education , which he says is an economic issue as well as a national security issue , another area where he believes his experience makes him a strong candidate			1
unable to finance his campaign himself , @entity122 has traveled extensively across his district talking to voters , but he says he spends at least 75 % of his days on the telephone trying to raise money			1
working with his small staff , he 's made about 9,000 donor calls since may and has raised some $ 500,000			2
he hopes to raise another million for his race			1
before running , @entity122 had not paid much attention to the fundraising aspect of campaigns			0
" i do n't think that 's something that 's on the average @entity168 's radar screen , " he said			2
" you hear a lot of it being talked about now because of the presidential election and the enormous amounts of money that have to go into a successful campaign for the presidency and so it is an issue that i think all of us @entity168 are learning more about			2
" high hopes both candidates are trying to keep their costs down this early in the campaign			0
@entity2 spends about $ 500 a month for rent on his newly opened campaign office , $ 50 a month for telephone service and about $ 5,000 a month on staff , and he 's also been relying on volunteers			1
@entity122 has three staffers and sometimes works out of the county @entity130 headquarters to save money			2
the big expenses will come a few months from now , when much of the money the candidates raise will go to advertising			1
a @entity196 analysis of data provided by @entity199 / @entity198 found that television ads for candidates running for @entity4 in 2010 racked up nearly 1.6 million airings at an estimated cost of $ 735 million , an amount that represents 61 % increase over 2008			1
" it 's definitely an uphill battle , but we also definitely have a shot , even more than a shot , " @entity122 said			0
@entity2 , who spoke with his pastor and prayed about whether to launch his candidacy , says " normal people " have to get out and run for office if they 're going to make a difference			0
for him it comes down to faith			0
" our country needs this , " he said			0
" if you look at it from my @entity222 faith , i look at it as @entity224 will provide a way so , you know , it 's daunting , but we 're headed straight forward and we 'll do the work that has to be done			0
