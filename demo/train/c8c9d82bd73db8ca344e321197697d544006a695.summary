@entity0 , @entity1 -- a small group gathered saturday in the @entity5 residence of @entity6 , an interior designer in @entity1			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , a bit of @entity12 and even @entity13 floated through the air as men in crisp , white pants carried umbrellas and women dressed in subdued blacks and grays greeted one another			2
the group boarded a large charter bus bound for @entity22 -- not to the @entity23 but to @entity0 -- for a ceremony to celebrate the life of @entity27 's daughter @entity26			2
on december 6 , 2012 , six weeks after @entity28 devastated the @entity29 , a message in a ginger ale bottle was discovered on a @entity0 beach amid heaps of trash left by the storm			1
it had been tossed into the ocean more than 10 years before by a little girl who was playing with family friends a few miles east			1
the note inside , scrawled in a child 's hand , read , " be excellent to yourself , dude			2
" there was a phone number beside it			0
on the back it read , " from @entity50			0
" @entity51 , who found the bottle , used the phone of fellow @entity55 disaster relief worker @entity54 to call the number			1
" i love a good story , and it was just laying there and it looked old , so i picked it up , " said @entity51 at saturday 's ceremony			2
but what they learned was that @entity62 , the author of the advice -- taken from the movie " @entity50 " -- had died in a fall in april 2010 at her boarding school in @entity67			1
she was 18 years old			2
the relationships that began because of that bottle , the remembrances shared since since its discovery , culminated in saturday 's excursion , at which @entity74 would dedicate a plaque in the beachside community and an arts fund established in @entity26 's name			1
on the bus ride to the beach , @entity62 shared stories of @entity26 's childhood , lighting up when she spoke of trips to @entity85 during which @entity26 taught her friends @entity8 -- even assigning homework -- and ventured out with her traditionally austere grandfather to jewelry shops , where they would turn sketches into small trinkets			1
" when she was little , we never bought anything ; i always made her make gifts			0
we always had to do something			0
it makes everything more special , " @entity62 said			1
out of a small black clutch , @entity6 pulled dozens of tiny , trimmed pictures of @entity26 at various ages : @entity26 in @entity85 , @entity26 as a toddler , @entity26 's last high school portrait before her death			2
she pored over @entity107 messages from her daughter 's friends , as well as text messages she and @entity111 had exchanged			0
@entity62 said she was so excited about the event that she 'd barely slept the past two nights			1
a welcoming committee was waiting in @entity0 , consisting of mayor @entity115 , parks and recreation director @entity116 , @entity111 and @entity51			0
@entity62 and her loved ones were greeted warmly			1
@entity118 broke through the overcast and drizzly weather shortly after the noon ceremony began			0
when it was time for her remarks , @entity62 wept , and thanked her friends for being there			1
her longtime partner , @entity125 , spoke also			0
" when life seems to be impossible , she ( @entity26 ) takes time out to talk to us , " @entity125 said			0
one of @entity26 's friends from boarding school , @entity130 , said @entity26 's death put things in perspective			1
" now you know what 's really important in life			0
you have a new outlook , " she said			0
after remarks from the men who found the bottle and @entity26 's friends , the plaque bearing the young woman 's photo was unveiled , nestled in a flowerbed between the community pool and the beach			1
through tears , her mother said it was beautiful			0
then , standing in the wet sand , @entity62 and friends new and old threw carnations into the waves			1
back home in @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity125 's apartment on @entity159 is filled with small reminders of @entity26 's short but larger - than - life existence			0
it 's decorated with modern @entity165 tables and plush furniture , but the eye is drawn up toward the ceiling by the artfully decorated walls , a dozen of @entity26 's expressive collages , drawings , and paintings hanging in clusters			0
" @entity26 was always telling me not to worry , that everything would be all right			0
her message in a bottle reminds me of that every day , " @entity125 said .			2

the message in a bottle was discovered on a @entity1 beach after @entity28
it had been *written* 10 years before by @entity186
@entity62 died in 2010 in a fall while at boarding school in @entity67
on saturday , a plaque was dedicated at the spot where the bottle was found
