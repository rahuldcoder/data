-- a hatchet attack on @entity3 police officers and two back - to - back attacks on uniformed officers in @entity6 have raised questions about whether the incidents may have been motivated by the attackers ' alignment with radical @entity11			1
@entity12 charged at four @entity3 police officers with a metal hatchet thursday , hitting two of them			1
the attack is the third on people in uniform in @entity20 in a week			2
@entity21 , the @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 , has recently called on sympathizers in the @entity26 to carry out attacks against men and women in uniform			2
the move raised concerns about such attacks in both the @entity34 and @entity6			2
attacks in @entity6 two attackers with some ties to radical @entity11 , in separate incidents , killed two men in uniform in @entity6 this week			1
on monday , a radical convert ran down two soldiers in his car , killing one of them			1
@entity45 , 25 , then led police on a chase before his car rolled into a ditch in @entity49 , a town southeast of @entity50			1

on wednesday , radical @entity55 convert @entity56 , 32 , shot and killed a soldier , cpl. @entity57 , who was standing guard at a veterans memorial in the capital , @entity61			1
@entity56 then stormed @entity62 and opened fire			2
@entity64 , sergeant - at - arms of the @entity6 @entity62 , and police officers fired dozens of rounds , killing @entity56			1

@entity56 had contact with other @entity75 , authorities there have said			1
official : @entity3 case does n't appear tied to radical @entity11 online postings attributed to @entity12 paint a portrait of someone who at the very least held controversial views			1
for example , in a comment posted last month to an online video discussing a global caliphate , a user with the name @entity84 seemed to justify jihad , " if the @entity91 and the @entity92 had never invaded and colonized the @entity11 lands after @entity94 , then there would be no need for @entity96 ! " @entity12 , a @entity97 convert , was killed during thursday 's attack			1
a law enforcement official told @entity0 on friday that the case does n't look like one of radical @entity11			1
@entity21 has a draw on the disaffected and those who do n't feel at home where they are , said jihad expert @entity107 of the @entity108			0
" the general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in @entity23 suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self - esteem , " he said			0
and @entity21 constantly cranks the pr machine , making expert use of slick videos and social media			0
@entity21 has , for an anti-western organization , been surprisingly attractive to young male recruits from the @entity26 as well as to some young women			0
more than 100 of the foreign fighters for @entity21 in @entity23 have come from the @entity34 , according to intelligence estimates			0
@entity6 authorities believe that 130 citizens are fighting in jihad			1
hundreds more have gone from @entity133 , which is geographically closer to the fight			0
@entity136 authorities place the number of @entity136 citizens fighting in @entity23 at 500			1
thousands more come from the @entity139 and @entity140			0
more than 3,000 have joined from @entity141 , the largest single contingency			0
@entity21 sympathies @entity21 ' global digital reach has terror experts worried about security in the @entity26 , especially attacks by lone wolves who may not have any official mission from international terrorists			0
and incidents have cropped up to support those fears			0
this week , a video turned up of a 17 - year - old @entity156 boy standing with @entity21 fighters and threatening to behead @entity159 leaders , including president @entity160 , and then to fly the @entity21 flag over the @entity162			0
and three schoolgirls from @entity164 were intercepted last week at an airport in @entity166 as they traveled to join jihad in @entity23			0
