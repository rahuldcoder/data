-- in preparation for co-hosting next summer 's @entity4 football championship , @entity1 has been transforming itself			1
with help from @entity10 funding , new airports , roads and impressive stadia are all set to be completed well in time before the first match kicks off in @entity12 on june 8			2
from the infrastructure to the event itself , organizers are now focusing on the matches that will be played in four of @entity1 's cities			1
" now we are looking at organizational issues and the most important in that is safety			0
@entity1 is not more dangerous than other @entity24 countries , " said @entity21 , @entity1 's minister for sport and tourism			1
great strides have been made in eradicating violence and hooliganism from football matches across @entity24 , but it remains a concern and on - going problem in many countries , including @entity1			1
the @entity34 final in may between @entity35 and @entity36 was marred by violent scenes and @entity38 , @entity24 football 's governing body , warned the @entity40 after hooliganism during the country 's international match against @entity44 in march			1
however new laws on assembly and who can enter stadia were passed earlier this year and led to numerous arrests			2
" they are already frightened because they were already arrested , " said @entity50 , @entity12 's mayor			0
" they were punished , some of the leaders were already punished by the courts and so i think ( @entity57 2012 ) will be ok			0
" @entity1 has looked to the @entity58 for examples of how to improve safety around football matches			1
" our new safety law is based on the @entity58 system , " said @entity21 referring to the way @entity64 football clubs and @entity58 government enacted numerous measures to remove a violent minority from attending football matches			2
" the main points are to get rid of anonymity			0
everyone at the stadium must be recognized by name and surname			0
" it is hoped that the face - recognition technology being trialed that can identify banned hooligans will be ready in time for the competition and augment other security measures , such security cameras and restricting access around stadia to ticket - holders			1
the country will be under the spotlight in june , but many believe the planning and measures taken by @entity1 's government and the event 's organizers will leave a positive legacy			1
" i think new the stadiums in themselves will create more interest in football , " said @entity96 , coach of @entity35			0
" fans will be able to enjoy the sport in more comfortable surroundings			0
also i think more players from abroad will come to play in @entity1 which will in turn raise the standard of our game			2
" @entity0 's @entity108 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 will co-host @entity4 football *tournament* with @entity112 next year
organizers are *beefing* up security arrangements to counter violent *incidents*
new stadia have been built and plans to use face - recognition technology
