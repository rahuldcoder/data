@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the edge of @entity1 's @entity5 peninsula , a lush coastal region , lies @entity0 ... a coral pink lake			1
nestled between white sand dunes and the @entity9 , this unique body of water was once the finishing point of the off - road car race , the @entity14			0
the three square kilometer fuchsia lake has been a candidate for @entity18 status since 2005 and is fast becoming one of @entity1 's most popular tourist destinations			1
while the rally may have shifted to @entity25 five years ago , men and women from @entity23 continue to come here for an entirely different reason -- to harvest salt			1
the salt content of @entity0 or @entity0 , as it 's locally known , rivals that of the @entity30 -- exceeding 40 % salinity in some parts -- and it is a combination of the sun and a salt - loving micro-algae , dunaliella salina , which has turned the water a brilliant shade of strawberry pink			1
men once used to fish in the lake but by the 1970s , in response to ongoing droughts and economic hardship , locals began to collect and sell salt to supplement their families ' income			1
24 - year - old @entity48 came from @entity49 to work in the lake seven years ago			2
he works alone , chest - high in the lake , for seven hours a day with the most basic of tools -- a basket , spade and stick			1
to protect his skin from the harsh salinity , @entity56 rubs shea butter on his body before entering the water			0
" as a harvester , if you do n't put shea butter on your skin , the salt will damage it and cut you , " he said			2
" the longer you stay inside the lake , the larger the salty water makes your wounds			1
if you do not cover those wounds with shea butter , they will become worse			0
" with a depth of only three meters , @entity56 paddles to his chosen area using a long stick to push against the bottom of the lake			2
the boat he rents is called a pirogue and is made of wood -- any engine or metal fixture would immediately start to rust			0
" i know where to collect the salt from			2
when the stick i am using touches the salt , i can feel it , " @entity48 said			2
" if i find a place , i attach my boat and use the shovel to see if there is enough salt in that place			2
after that , i put the sticks in place and start piling the salt around those sticks			2
" it is estimated 1,000 people work around this lake -- 600 men and 400 women who collect 24,000 tons of salt each year			1
" the people working here as harvesters are @entity49 , some are @entity112 , some @entity113 , @entity114 and even some from @entity115			0
there are also some @entity1 , " @entity48 said			1
it is mainly men who work as harvesters , filling their baskets with salt before heaving it over their heads into their boats			1
" sometimes i harvest 10 to 12 buckets , " @entity48 said			0
by the time @entity56 paddles back , his 21 - year - old wife , @entity125 , is onshore , awaiting his return to carry the salt from boat to land			0
fame makes 60 cents for each bucket of salt he collects			1
his wife earns five cents for every bucket she transports			1
in the midday heat , men and women move between piles of salt -- transporting , drying and trading the mineral			0
over 70 % of it is exported around @entity23 , particularly to the @entity143			0
" here , we have two different types of salt , " said @entity144 , a wholesaler who buys and re-sells salt			0
" the first is called ' medium salt			0
' this type of salt is bought by people drying fish or working in the leather industry			0
" the ' big salt ' is the second type which we use in @entity1 in our food , " he said			1
" however , in @entity163 , they use the ' big salt ' to melt ice on the roads			0
" while most of @entity56 's salt will be sold on , he has kept some for his family back in @entity49 in the hopes that one day , he can share it with his father , who also used to be a salt harvester on @entity0			1
" it will be a gift to my mother that she will cook with , " he said			0
more : souks , sea and surf			0

bright pink lake in @entity1 is as salty as the @entity30
@entity183 harvesters spend seven hours a day *immersed* in the lake
each bucket of salt makes them just 60 cents
