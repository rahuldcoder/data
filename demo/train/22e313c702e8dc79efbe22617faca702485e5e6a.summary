-- all of the candidates in the presidential campaign agree the 2012 election will revolve around the economy			1
although there are signs that conditions are slightly improving , the high unemployment rate and the depressed housing market are causing immense anxiety among @entity12 voters			1
as a result , most of the political debate has centered on how the nation will rebound from the steep 2007 - 09 recession and anemic recovery that has afflicted the nation throughout president @entity21 's term in the @entity22			0
republicans and @entity24 have tried to walk a political high wire as the release of new economic data continually changes the playing field			2
@entity30 , for instance , fell into a trap when he admitted that there were signs the economy was improving , a statement that caused many republicans to grumble about their front - runner handing @entity24 the key issue			1
meanwhile , @entity21 's optimism has often been undercut with data showing that the situation is still bad			0
with all the attention that has been given to short - term economic recovery , however , politicians in both parties have generally avoided the types of long - term structural challenges that are really at the heart of national anxiety and which greatly threaten @entity12 's ability to compete with @entity51 and other rising economic powers			1
the first problem has been the exodus of good jobs to other countries			1
in one of the most troubling developments of recent decades , many types of industrial jobs have been shipped overseas			1
and by and large , they wo n't be returning			0
numerous companies have built facilities in other countries where labor costs are lower , workplace laws are lax or nonexistent and other kinds of regulations are weak			0
according to a recent study by the @entity70 , the @entity12 lost 5.7 million manufacturing jobs in the 2000s			1
if these trends continue , the tight labor market will become the new normal			0
the chances for high school and college graduates to land solid jobs in the @entity12 will diminish , as has already been the case for many working @entity12 who have watched the factories shut down			1
another chronic challenge facing the @entity12 is the rising level of inequality in the @entity12			1
the gap between the rich and poor has grown dramatically since the 1970s			0
a troubling trend that has lasted for decades has been that the average income of the top 5 % has risen while the average income of the rest of the nation has fallen			2
the number of @entity12 in the ranks of the middle class has thinned			1
the income supports upon which workers depended have diminished , both those provided by government and by private employers			0
more @entity12 find themselves squeezed lower onto the lower rungs of the economic ladder			1
as many commentators have noted , there are a number of causes for this growing gap , including public policy			0
without the ability of the government and private markets to reverse this trend , the @entity12 will not be able to sustain the kind of vibrant middle class -- which in the 1940s and 1950s was attainable by more and more @entity12 -- that has been the engine behind the @entity12 dream			1
the final challenge is an urban crisis that has decimated pockets of @entity12			1
as @entity121 showed in his award - winning book , " @entity124 , " the breakdown of the cities began in the 1940s and 1950s as racist employment practices and real estate markets hampered the ability of african - americans to get good jobs or relocate into better neighborhoods			1
the problems accelerated as jobs continued to move into the suburbs ( before moving overseas )			2
rioting in the 1960s further devastated these communities			0
the result of the urban crisis has been that multiple generations of inner - city residents have lived with little hope for a better future and have struggled to make ends meet , trying to survive on streets that are ridden by crime and drugs			0
many black leaders have been deeply disappointed that @entity21 , the first @entity148 - @entity12 occupant of the @entity22 , has not done much to address these issues			2
although @entity152 @entity151 recently proposed tax cuts to lure business into these areas , there is little evidence that such a change in policy would do much to reverse decades of decay			2
these are not the kinds of issues that politicians like to talk about in their campaigns			0
as opposed to temporary recessions , these quasi-permanent structural challenges have been decades in the making and will require wrenching policy choices as well as dramatic market developments to resolve			2
if our political leaders do n't address these issues that underlie the concerns of the nation , it will become ever more difficult to re-create the vibrant economic conditions that existed during the " @entity177 " when grand expectations about the future , as the historian @entity178 argued , guided public debate			0
then , the nation was strong and the possibilities for growth seemed infinite			0
today , even if short - term conditions improve , our economy is far from what it used to be			0
how to achieve a better future is the debate that we really should be having in 2012			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

candidates agree that the economy is the main issue in the election
@entity193 says they *'re* ignoring the deeper economic challenge @entity12 faces
good jobs have gone *offshore* , inequality is growing and urban areas lag , he says
@entity193 : @entity12 economic problems are decades in the making and need serious attention
