-- " @entity6 " are back for a second season and according to star @entity3 we can expect even more nefarious plotting and lustful encounters			1
the 63 - year - old actor has had a long career including an @entity9 for " @entity10 " and voicing the malevolent @entity11 in " @entity12			1
" he recently spoke to @entity0 about playing a pope and his not - so - secret vice			2
@entity0 : what can we expect this season ? @entity3 : you can expect a good ride , a naughty ride , a good ride			1
i think you can expect an even more exciting ride than last season			2
it 's perkier ; it 's faster with a lot of surprises			2
@entity0 : when you first signed up , were you worried that it would be historical soft porn ? @entity3 : no , because i know @entity29 , i know @entity30			1
i thought that we 'd avoid that and i think we have			2
@entity0 : the show is like " @entity34 " in the @entity35			2
@entity3 : i would say that 's right			1
@entity0 : the characters are pretty venal			2
@entity3 : yes life was more on the edge			1
life was not valued quite as highly as it is today			2
people were used to fighting , people were used to dying			0
@entity43 was much more a part of life than it is today			0
children and women would die in childbirth			0
the whole perception was different			0
@entity0 : you play a pope who has children			0
would you be surprised if it was discovered that @entity54 has kids ? @entity3 : um , not particularly ( laughs )			1
@entity0 : your voice is like catnip to the ladies			0
@entity3 : i do n't think about it			1
you use what you 've got ! before i was married i did n't sound like this because i did n't smoke so much			0
@entity0 : so smoking is good for actors ? @entity3 : well in truth , to be serious , i suppose it 's not particularly good , but it does give me huge pleasure and allows me time for reflection			1
if i did yoga perhaps i would n't have to , but i do n't			0
i go outside and have a smoke and i find those gaps in the hurly burly of the film world very useful			0
@entity0 : is the cigarette accompanied by a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit ? @entity3 : often ( speaking with a full mouth )			1
there 's a chocolate biscuit in my mouth at the moment and a cup of tea but no cigarette			0
but there will be one in a minute			0
@entity0 : your son @entity88 ( " @entity90 " ) is gorgeous ! @entity3 : that 's very nice			1
he takes after his mother			0
@entity0 : i have little kids			0
i think i 've seen " @entity12 " 30 times			1
@entity3 : there 's something wrong with you			1
@entity0 : do you get people coming up to you with your kids ? @entity3 : i do and the kids sort of look at me so embarrassed			2
scar is a lion on the screen for them			0
they stand there looking long suffering while their parents make me write them an autograph			0
@entity0 : what 's your favorite movie ? @entity3 : it 's strange because it 's always the experience of making it that 's the great thing			1
making " @entity120 " was fantastic , making " @entity124 " was a great experience , making " @entity123 " was a great experience			1
making " @entity6 " is a great experience			1
we have a lot of fun , great crew , great cast , shooting in a fantastic city , @entity133			1
i get up and i 'm really pleased to work and that 's what i 'll remember			0
in a way , it never has much actually to do with what the movie 's like			0
@entity0 : @entity133 is a beautiful city			0
@entity3 : i like the youth of the city and it has a slightly crumbly nature about it because they have n't quite got the money to finish everything off .			2

the actor voiced the malevolent @entity11 in " @entity12 "
