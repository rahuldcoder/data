@entity1 senior international correspondent @entity0 spent two days in the @entity2 , @entity3 , covering the heavy fighting between @entity6 forces and @entity8 militants that has devastated the city			1
thousands of civilians still live in the city , either unwilling or unable to flee			2
@entity0 described his experiences -- including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift graveyard and hid under cushions to protect themselves from @entity8 shelling -- in an ask me anything chat on @entity19			1
here are the highlights from the hourlong conversation			2
some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity			2
@entity29 : " i 'm sure you saw and experienced a lot of devastating things in your time over there			2
what was the most heartbreaking thing you saw ? do you think outside / foreign involvement over there is having more of a positive or negative impact on the people ? " asked smedynski			2
@entity0 : " the kids in their cushion shelter is always tough			1
i also remember a bomb shelter some kids made -- two years ago now -- in a refugee camp in @entity42			2
they were literally digging a cave with their hands			2
foreign help comes in many forms			2
the @entity49 are just across the border , but the @entity6 claim they are impeding resupply			1
the @entity51 help a lot with heavy weapons			2
and the coalition airstrikes also keep @entity8 back and have helped the @entity6 hang on			1
but in the end the sheer volume of outside parties now with stakes in the fight for the town means that it will go on a long time			0
" @entity29 : " @entity61 , amazing report from @entity2 - how long were you there and how did you get in ? " asked @entity65			1
we were there just under 48 hours			0
i ca n't really say much about how we got in -- it was a mix of simple and complicated -- but we are grateful to the @entity6 for their hospitality and care			1
" q : " what 's the current situation for journalists there ? interested to know about how you get your stories out , how you manage the day to day ? " asked ithinkandroid			0
" thank you in advance			0
" @entity0 : " it is complicated			1
anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it , and not file until out			2
day to day , you need the full invitation and hospitality of the @entity6 to operate in any way			1
" q : " did you feel safe under the @entity6 care and hospitality ? " asked monhen			1
@entity0 : yes , as safe as one can there			1
q : you probably are n't allowed to answer this , but , i 'll ask anyways			0
" how does your personal understanding and experience being there , seeing things , and working there differ from what is ultimately reported ? perhaps it does n't ? or , maybe it does ? in either case , i am curious to hear your thoughts			0
and , thanks for taking the time to do this @entity106 ! " asked rurd			0
@entity0 : " it 's the same			1
there is n't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a preordained script			0
you see what we do			0
i know that 's hard to believe in this social media age of micro-digestion , but it 's true			0
" q : " did you interview any @entity8 members ? " asked shouldbeworking23			1
@entity0 : " the nature of @entity8 means that in person you are unlikely -- or ill - advised -- to interview them			1
social media interaction and @entity127 are possible -- and my colleagues have managed that			0
the @entity6 did not have any @entity8 prisoners at the time we were inside @entity2			1
" @entity29 : " thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story			0
did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the @entity6 side ? is there any truth to the reports of @entity8 getting resupplied from the @entity49 side of the border ? how effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on @entity8 ? and last but not least , have you ever touched @entity146 's beard ? again , thank you			1
@entity0 : " no , no foreign nationals			1
we were told there may be some , but saw none			0
@entity8 are not , as far as we can see , getting any resupply -- the @entity49 are in a bind as they are both presumably trying to not end up in an open fight with @entity8 , whilst securing their own borders			1
the coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying @entity8 the chance to take all of @entity2			1
the strikes have also meant @entity8 have had to pour in and lose fighters and equipment			1
they ca n't finish the fight off , though			0
that will take better equipping for the @entity6			1
@entity146 's beard is off limits			0
" @entity29 : " @entity167			0
what do you see as the best solution for the situation in @entity3 right now ? any ideas how to remove @entity174 from power ( if that is even the best way to go about reaching some level of peace ) ? " asked ceclimber22			1
@entity0 : " you ca n't tackle @entity8 without also addressing the reason why such extremism has a constituency -- the three years of massacres of @entity184 that @entity174 forces perpetrated			1
but an overall solution for @entity3 is outside of the resources the @entity188 wants to commit at this point			1
there are also too many other players who want an opposite outcome -- @entity194 / @entity193			0
the @entity188 should be , and perhaps has been , mindful that their increased presence -- like ground troops -- has often become the lightning rod for all anger -- adding a new problem rather than fixing the original one			0
in end , @entity3 is going to be a conflict that tires of itself			1
one key problem is that this war has become a proxy conflict for many sides and keeps expanding -- dragging in @entity210 , and more different militias			0
so the point in which the combatants get exhausted keeps staying out of reach			0
it will take a singular seismic event that prompts serious international action , or more likely eventual exhaustion , to stop this war			0
" q : " what are your thoughts on the @entity8 torture videos released yesterday ? do you think the videos will provoke @entity8 to expedite their attacks on @entity188 soil ? also , from your perspective , how concerned should we be in regards to @entity8 growth ? the news reports they 're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in @entity3 ? " asked @entity232			1
@entity0 : " @entity8 grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar , and then when they ran into @entity210 , taking @entity237			1
since then , their victories have been incremental			0
they have n't had the huge storming win they need for recruitment -- the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits			0
they are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps , but not geographical reach -- if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying , but not game - changers			0
" q : " does @entity8 / @entity255 actually consider the term ' @entity257 ' as offensive ? i have only seen the one report by " residents " in @entity237 saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive			1
will renaming them , across all fronts , actually do anything ? thanks ! " asked zib_al - jihad			0
@entity0 : " i do n't think renaming them @entity270 makes any difference			2
it might mildly annoy those who watch @entity275 politicians on tv			0
but in the end , a slightly more forcible strategy is required than intellectualized name - calling			0
" @entity29 : " if you could tell the @entity188 public just one thing about @entity8 , what would it be ? " asked @entity280			2
@entity0 : " a decade of policies in the @entity287 helped create them			2
you need to help find and fund the solution , or it will become a problem on your soil , not just the @entity287			0
