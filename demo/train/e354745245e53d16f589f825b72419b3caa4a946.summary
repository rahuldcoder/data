-- on saturday , in the wake of the rocket attack that downed @entity5 17 , @entity2 president @entity1 urged the @entity7 secretary - general to recognize the two main rebel groups in his country , the @entity10 and the @entity11 , as terrorist organizations			1
in a similar vein monday , @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity14 that everyone must chose between the terrorists and the civilized world			1
although any country can declare those two rebel groups terrorist in accordance with their national legislation , and so make it illegal for any of their nationals to provide them with support , the @entity7 secretary - general can not , and nor can any other part of the @entity7 , except possibly the @entity28			2
the reason is that there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism			1
in fact , the debate on what terrorism means has been going on at the @entity7 for at least 20 years , stuck in major disagreement over what may be considered legitimate when people are fighting for their right to self - determination			0
there are , however , many international conventions that define acts of terrorism , one of the earliest being the 1971 convention for the suppression of @entity48 , which would certainly cover the downing of the @entity51 airliner , so long as the act was shown to be intentional			1
but for @entity1 , the rebels in the @entity55 and @entity56 regions were terrorists long before @entity58 came down , and will remain so whether or not they are proved responsible			2
@entity60 president @entity59 would see it differently			0
although he backs president @entity63 's characterization of all rebel groups in @entity65 as terrorists , in the @entity2 case he believes that the rebels are exercising their rights to self - defense and self - determination			1
the two issues are not completely similar because the @entity65 rebels are looking to change their government rather than their nationality , but in both cases use of the terrorist label has the same intention of inviting universal condemnation			2
it makes it harder to distinguish between what may be legitimate and what is not			0
and here lies one of the complexities of so many current areas of conflict around the world , where borders have become disputed not by the states that exist on either side , but by the people who live inside them and resent the identity or confinement that they confer			0
since 9/11 , terrorism has come a long way from the isolated cases of assassination or attack that were common beforehand			0
a movement such as the @entity103 , or @entity103 , which even terrorist groups regard as terrorist , is as much an overt insurgency as a covert group of bombers and killers			1
in fact , the territory it currently controls makes it one of the wealthiest oil producers in the @entity114			0
@entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , all universally regarded as terrorist groups , control large areas of territory and aim to extend their reach			1
they are not like the @entity122 , the @entity123 , @entity124 or other historic organizations that more easily fit the popular concept of terrorism			0
another issue that arises in the @entity2 case is that if the rebels are terrorists , what does that make @entity60 ? state - sponsored terrorism has been less of an issue since the rise of @entity117 , which seems to have done perfectly well without it			1
and while there are murky relationships between illegal armed groups and governments in parts of @entity141 and @entity142 , state sponsorship on a scale that involves the supply of missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft at 30,000 feet would seem to deserve a name more closely related to conventional warfare			0
so we now have a nasty mix in many places around the world of terrorism , armed opposition groups and proxy wars , all dressed up in ambiguity , denial and obfuscation			2
and while these dirty wars drag on , only one thing remains constant -- the dead bodies strewn around the fields and towns , whether fallen from the sky or just lying where they stood			0
it does n't much matter whether the international community regards the @entity2 rebel forces as terrorists or not , there are no possible reasons or exculpatory factors that can excuse what happened to @entity58 , if -- as seems to be the case -- it was brought down by a missile fired from territory under their control			1
join us on @entity183 / @entity182 .			0

@entity2 president says @entity187 rebels should be called terrorists
@entity190 : there 's no internationally agreed definition of terrorism
under ' 71 agreement , @entity51 *jet* 's downing would be terrorism -- but only if intentional
@entity190 : the world is seeing a merging of terrorist groups and *quasi-states*
