-- a century after her childhood inspiration @entity3 won two gold medals at the @entity5 , synchronized swimmer @entity1 will be competing in her first games in @entity7 this year			1
like the legendary athlete , @entity1 comes from a part @entity10 background in @entity11 , and is a registered member of @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
@entity3 , who grew up in the @entity14 , was spoken of in hushed tones by her elders			1
" i 'm very proud of my background , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
her tribe are proud of her as well , regularly highlighting her achievements in their publications			2
in her first solo synchronized swimming competition in 2003 , @entity1 's routine was set to @entity24 flute music and she wore a decoration of the @entity13 seal on her hip			1
while growing up , she visited the house where @entity3 had lived -- and he was the subject of one of her school projects			2
@entity3 was one of the greatest all - round athletes in sporting history , playing professional @entity24 football , baseball and basketball as well as his track and field exploits -- he won gold in the pentathlon and decathlon at the @entity5			1
he was controversially stripped of his @entity42 medals when it was discovered he had earned a few dollars while playing semi- professional baseball , but the @entity45 restored them in 1983 -- 30 years after he died in poverty			2
effortless performance while she has a long way to go to match @entity3 's @entity42 achievements , @entity1 is already making her name in a sport where the required elegance and good timing in the pool is forged by a grueling training regime of up to 60 hours per week			1
but all the work in the water paid off when she and duet partner @entity59 qualified for the @entity60 earlier this year			2
a seventh - placed finish at the @entity42 qualification event at the @entity63 in @entity7 served notice of their potential and sealed a place in the @entity6 proper			1
at just 21 , @entity1 will be the youngest member of the @entity70 team and will be gaining valuable experience			1
@entity72 , the national team manager for the squad , has high hopes for @entity1 and @entity59 , who has taken a break from her studies at @entity78 to concentrate on the @entity42			1
they formed their partnership only last year and soon won the silver medal at the @entity6 behind @entity82			0
" they are both so young but their goal will be continue to improve and to keep getting better , " @entity72 told @entity0			0
early years @entity1 was already a competitive swimmer in @entity85 when she was first introduced to synchro , aged 11			2
" one of my friends invited me over to a summer program that she had got involved with and i absolutely fell in love with it , " she said			0
" the combination of music and athletics was amazing			0
it was something i felt i could do it for a long time			0
" showing early talent , @entity1 has made steady improvement each year , winning a clutch of junior and age group national titles , competing in both the solo discipline and duets			1
her first team was pirouettes of @entity85 , where she was inspired to greater things by the exploits of @entity108 , who represented the @entity70 at the @entity109 in @entity110			1
" i also looked up a lot to @entity115 , a three - time @entity116 , who won bronze in the duet in @entity110 , " said @entity1 , who now competes for the @entity112 club in @entity113			1
grueling regime to reach that medal - winning standard at major games , @entity1 knows that many hours of training are required both in the pool and gym			1
" i train between eight and 10 hours per day , " she said			0
two three to four hour sessions in the pool are interspersed with a weight - training program that lasts about an hour			0
this schedule is repeated six days a week , and absolute dedication is required			0
" it 's mentally difficult just to push yourself that hard every day			0
a lot of people do n't realize just how difficult it is , " she admitted			0
@entity137 squared all that hard work has started to pay off , particularly since she formed her partnership with @entity141 last year			0
at 22 , @entity59 is slightly older but they had known each other after competing for several years at the same competitions and they have formed a strong friendship			0
" she 's like a sister to me , " said @entity1			2
" we have to think the same , we have to hear music the same and we have to go to practice everyday and spend eight to 10 hours in the water with just each other			0
" fellow @entity70 squad team members have coined a nickname for the pair : " @entity137 squared " as they share the same initials and have the same tastes			1
@entity42 dreams the duo will go into their first games without the pressure of medal expectation in a sport currently dominated by @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			2
but @entity1 is certainly not writing off their chances of causing an upset			2
" there 's always that chance that if we push ourselves hard maybe just maybe we can reach the podium , " she said			0
" this is it , this is what we 've been working for			0
we really want to go out and show what we can do			0
" with synchronized swimmers reaching their peak from their mid- 20s onwards , @entity177 in 2016 remains a long - term target for @entity1 .			1

@entity1 will be competing in her first *olympics* in @entity7
the 21 - year - old will be youngest member of the @entity70 @entity186 team
@entity1 inspired by exploits of @entity42 legend @entity3 , also a @entity10
she is a proud member of the @entity13
