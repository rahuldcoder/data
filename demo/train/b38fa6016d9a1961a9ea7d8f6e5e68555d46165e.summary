-- at least one in six people worldwide does n't have access to clean water , and this contributes to about 1.5 million preventable deaths each year , according to the @entity7			1
@entity8 , a top 10 @entity9 in 2009 , is trying to help change that			1
through his nonprofit , @entity11 , the former bartender from @entity13 has helped provide clean water to more than 150,000 people in 15 countries			1
wine - tasting events are one way @entity8 and his group raise the funds that enable them to distribute water filters and help install wells in communities around the world			1
and next month , bartenders from 16 countries will be donating their tips to the cause			2
for @entity32 , @entity0 's @entity31 sat down with @entity8 to talk about the crisis and his recent efforts to help some of the 3.6 million people displaced by the @entity37 conflict			1
@entity0 : what should people know about the water crisis ? @entity8 : it takes many women and children four and five hours , every single day , just to get water			1
and then it 's absolutely filthy , and it 's making their children sick			0
diarrhea kills more children under 5 than @entity51 , malaria and measles combined			0
and 88 % of ( those ) deaths are caused by poor sanitation , unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene			2
a lot of people ask me , " if this water crisis is so bad , how come we have n't heard much about it ? " well , here in the @entity65 , we help support things that we can empathize with			1
we know what it 's like to lose a loved one to a disease like cancer			0
we understand what it means to need a good , solid education for a child			0
so ( those causes ) get a lot of the spotlight			0
but it 's hard for us to empathize with the water crisis			2
we wash our cars ; we water our lawn			2
we just ca n't imagine what it 's like to not have access to water			1
@entity0 : why did you start working on this issue ? @entity8 : i began raising funds to support the fight against the global water crisis back in 2004 , and i had an opportunity to live in @entity93 , @entity94 , during the height of the genocide there			1
my job was to ( work in ) refugee camps and get them access to water			1
when i first started witnessing these women and children and the effort they would go through for a cup of water , and then to see actually the water that they were providing to their kids -- when you see that firsthand , you ca n't help but be changed			2
when i came home , it 's all i could think about			0
so i decided this is what i want to do with my life			0
@entity9 changed everything for wine to @entity122 and for me			1
when i was ( honored ) back in 2009 , it had taken us five years to reach about 25,000 people in four different countries around the world			1
now we 're in 15 different countries around the world			1
@entity37 is our latest one we just added			2
@entity0 : why did you get involved in the situation in @entity37 ? @entity8 : right now in @entity37 , every single day , thousands of people are fleeing their homes because of this fighting ... going to an unknown future , with no resources			1
in these ( displacement ) camps , a lot of the men have either been killed or they 're all fighting , so it 's mostly populated by children and women			0
the vast majority is children			0
and as you know , a lot of these kids ' systems are very weak , and they 're drinking filthy water			2
my first thought was , " let 's see if we can get some water filters into these camps			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity9 another big reason for me was that the first country i worked in , @entity94 , was a predominantly @entity162 country , and i 've really felt a connection with the @entity162 world ever since			1
i really wanted to get out there and reach out , to show that we want to help in any way we can			0
@entity0 : what are you doing to help ? @entity8 : we created a partnership with @entity172 ( a @entity174 - based @entity162 charity ) , and right now we 're actively working in two camps in the northwestern region , near border areas between @entity37 and @entity178			1
i was able to ( go ) inside some of these camps , inside @entity37 , just a couple months ago			2
the living conditions , they 're terrible			0
on that trip , i was able to bring about 350 filters with me			0
until we can get each household to have their own water filter , which is the ultimate goal , we have a couple of distribution areas where people can come with their buckets of water and run ( it ) through a number of filters in order to clean it			1
when it 's not an emergency situation , we can go into an area and teach them , using their local resources , how to build their own water filter			0
but in a war zone , like what 's going on in @entity37 , we just need to get a clean water fix immediately			1
@entity37 is the very first location that we 're using these @entity209 filters			2
we 're really excited about them			0
if they 're used properly , they will last 10 years and filter 250 gallons of water every day			2
we have another partnership with an organization called @entity216 that 's going to be also sending meals over to @entity37			2
so we 're packaging a container with about 250,000 meals , and then we 'll also be packaging 1,000 water filters in that , so there 'll be about 1,350 filters altogether in these two camps			0
and this 'll be just the first of many shipments , hopefully			0
if we can get the support of more people back home , we 'll be able to send over a lot more filters			0
@entity0 : how can people help wine to @entity122 with this issue ? @entity8 : we have a really cool campaign going on right now where people can actually get involved from all over the world to help support our work			1
it 's called just one shift			0
the whole concept is , bartenders from around the world are going to unite together and give up the tips from one of their shifts during one week ( april 8 - 14 ) to support our efforts with wine to @entity122			1
we 've already had bartenders in 16 different countries sign up			0
you can go to our website , and we have a link for @entity253 where you can click and see if there 's a ( participating ) bar in your hometown and what night the bartender is giving up their shift			0
so you can go and have some drinks and know that all the tips that you 're giving that night are going to be donated back to us at wine to @entity122			1
and that will allow us to be able to bring more of these water filters into the displaced persons camps all throughout @entity37			1
the service industry crowd , the bartenders out there , they 're all people that love to build relationships , that love to talk about what 's going on in the world and how can we fix it			0
with this @entity253 campaign , bartenders around the world are going to prove that we can change the world			0
@entity0 : you visited @entity37 in december , and you 're going back again next month			2
do you ever worry about the risk ? @entity8 : going inside @entity37 reminds me a lot of my time ( in @entity94 )			1
when i was younger , i was a little more reckless ; i did n't have as much to lose			0
now i have a wife and two kids , and so i do find myself thinking , " is this work really worth risking my life over ? " you know , when you see these families get to access clean water , it makes the answer pretty easy : of course it 's worth it			1
a lot of people think because the number is so big , what can one person really do ? it 's just too overwhelming			0
but if you think , " i could help one other person or five other people or one village , " you can make a huge difference .			0
