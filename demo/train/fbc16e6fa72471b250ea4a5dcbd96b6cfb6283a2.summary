-- here 's something you do n't see every day : the 99 % demonstrating in support of the 1 %			0
but that 's exactly what 's been happening for several weeks all around @entity6 at @entity8 grocery stores			1
in 1916 , @entity9 and @entity10 , who immigrated to the @entity11 from @entity12 , opened a grocery store in @entity14 , @entity15			0
almost a century later , the family has expanded it to a chain of 71 supermarkets across @entity15 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
in 2008 , @entity23 and @entity10 's grandson @entity22 was elected president of the @entity8 board			1
by all accounts , @entity22 , as he is known , presided over a very successful and happy company			0
not only did @entity8 continue to expand and reap profits â € ” generating $ 4 billion in revenues in 2012 â € ” but workers have thrived as well			1
full - time clerks start at $ 12 an hour			0
@entity32 with experience can earn over $ 40,000 a year			0
and managers can easily make into the six figures			0
keep in mind that 's in a nation where the average annual salary for grocery store cashiers is $ 21,370 and the national minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour			0
the company also has a generous retirement plan , matching 15 % of annual salary to employee retirement funds			0
what 's more , workers up and down the supply chain receive good bonuses throughout the year			2
all this and @entity8 is affordable for customers , with prices regularly 10 % to 20 % lower than competitors			1
the company is profitable in an industry known for low profit margins , and has given $ 500 million in dividends to the nine family shareholders over the past decade			2
in other words , at a time when corporate executives and wealthy investors regularly try to argue that companies can not pay workers well and be successful in generating profits , @entity8 has been an impressive and stunning example to the contrary			1
market basket has been a good company all around -- until recently , when things changed			1
so what happened ? well , the family board switched sides , ousted @entity22 and installed his cousin @entity73 as president			0
one of the first acts under @entity73 was to distribute $ 250 million in profits to the nine family shareholders , what a @entity78 editorial called " an uncharacteristic act of greed for a firm known for its generous treatment of its workers and concern for price - conscious shoppers			1
" there have been other ominous signs that @entity73 and his allies plan to push profit at all costs -- at the expense of workers and the values of the company			2
and so in an unprecedented mobilization , managers and workers have protested at market baskets across @entity6 , calling for their beloved ceo @entity100 to be reinstated			1
last week , more than 6,000 @entity8 workers and managers joined in a peaceful march outside the company 's headquarters in @entity106 , @entity15			1
if you go to any @entity108 around @entity6 right now , you 're likely to find employees and even some customers holding up signs protesting the new executive and supporting the ousted @entity113 are also using social media to get their message out , using hashtags like # @entity117			2
of course , if you go inside a @entity8 you 're not likely to find much ; even the warehouse workers are on strike			1
these protests are n't being organized by unions ; after all , @entity8 workers are n't unionized			1
they 're being organized by the employees and managers of the company			0
already , eight managers have been fired for helping lead the protests			0
as a result , the company is reportedly losing $ 1 million a day			0
a reporter interviewed one of the @entity8 workers at a protest			1
" i have a friend who works at @entity135 , " she said , " and i asked her , would they ever do this for their ceo ? " the woman laughed			2
but what has become of capitalism in @entity11 is not funny : the extreme greed of a few overrunning the best interests of everyone , including workers , communities and a healthy growing economy			0
just like the @entity151 protesters before them , the @entity8 workers are not protesting against capitalism			1
they 're protesting for a certain kind of capitalism , a capitalism that works for owners as well as for workers and communities			2
it 's the kind of capitalism that has made @entity8 a successful business for generations , the kind of capitalism that once meant shared prosperity and opportunity in @entity11			1
the @entity8 managers and cashiers and bag boys joining in protest are n't just holding signs , they 're also holding the aspirations of the majority of @entity11			2
those of us concerned about the growing economic inequality in @entity11 do n't want to " eat the rich " â € ” we simply do n't want the rich to chew up and spit out everyone else .			0

workers from @entity8 are protesting and calling for their *ex-ceo* to be reinstated
@entity181 : @entity8 , until it changed ceo recently , has been a great place to work
she says like @entity151 , @entity8 workers want shared prosperity
@entity181 : but *current* leaders of @entity8 are greedy and cater to shareholders
