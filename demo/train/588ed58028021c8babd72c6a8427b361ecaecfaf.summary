-- our understanding of physical reality â € ” of everything and nothing â € ” has changed forever			1
we do n't yet know where we are heading , but nothing will ever be the same			0
as a scientist , i do n't know what more i could ask for			0
on july 4 , two independent teams of more than 3,000 physicists apiece from more than 40 countries working at the largest particle accelerator on @entity14 at the @entity15 , or @entity15 , gathered to announce to the world the discovery of a new elementary particle			1
this was not just any elementary particle			2
it was a particle that appears to have all the characteristics of the @entity23 , which was first predicted by physicists in 1964 and became the most sought - after particle ever since			1
the @entity23 particle is an essential part of the @entity28 of particle physics , one of the most beautiful theories ever created by the human mind			1
the model provides an eloquent description of almost all of nature as we have observed in experiments in a few equations that can fit on a t - shirt			0
the only problem was that no experiment had ever provided evidence that the @entity23 particle actually exists			1
news : @entity23 is like ... a @entity46 fan ? without the @entity23 , the heart of the @entity28 is missing			2
the @entity23 is associated with an invisible field predicted to permeate throughout all of space interacting with particles to give them mass. the @entity23 is the key to unlocking the question : why does matter have mass ? equally importantly , the @entity23 allows two of the four forces in nature -- the electromagnetic force and the weak force , which is responsible for most nuclear reactions -- to be unified and described by mathematics of the same type that describe the other two known forces , the so - called strong force and gravity			1
quantum mechanics tells us that if such a @entity23 field exists , then one can produce real particles out of the field if one throws enough energy into a small enough volume			2
the discovery of this new particle is notable for what it tells us , but also for what it does n't			2
there were some intriguing anomalies in the observation of this @entity81 particle			1
for example , the rate at which the new particle is produced seems to be slightly higher than the one predicted in the @entity28			2
however , this could merely be a statistical fluke that results from the fact that to date only a few score of @entity23 candidate events have been observed amongst billions of particle collisions			1
there are still important unanswered questions about the @entity28 and we have to verify that this remarkable theoretical house of cards can stand on its own			0
deviations from the @entity28 prediction , if they are confirmed by more data , can shed light on these unknowns			0
what is the @entity23 and why is it important ? first and foremost is the question of how the invisible background field tied to the existence of the @entity23 came to be and why it has the properties it does			1
this field is simply posited to exist , and apparently it does			0
the @entity81 particle takes us a step closer to solving the mystery of the universe , which is inextricably connected to the mystery of our own origin			1
likewise , other new physics is now more likely to be uncovered at @entity15 's @entity117 , which will add to our knowledge base			0
we might , for example , find the particles that make up more than 90 % of the matter in our galaxy and all galaxies , which look dark to our eyes			0
and we might be provided with clues that reveal the trail to unraveling the ultimate holy grail of fundamental particle physics -- a quantum theory of gravity			0
imagine that the visible universe and everything in it was once contained in a volume many times smaller than the size of a single atom			0
with a quantum theory of gravity , we may be able to trace the @entity140 expansion back to its very beginning , and understand precisely how our universe arose , presumably from nothing			0
read more science news on @entity145 whatever new door to reality the discovery of @entity23 opens for us , the best days may be ahead			1
that possibility is what energizes us , and makes the continued effort to probe new corners of nature such an exciting part of the human adventure			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

physicists discovered a new particle that appears to be the highly sought after @entity23
@entity158 : our understanding of physical reality has changed forever
he says the @entity23 is the key to unlocking the question : why does matter have mass ?
@entity158 : @entity81 particle gets us closer to solving the mystery of the universe and our origin
