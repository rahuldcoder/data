-- as a @entity3 living in @entity4 , i remember the @entity7 / @entity6 " special relationship " of the early 2000s with great fondness			1
it seemed that our two countries might remake the world			0
with @entity15 providing the vision and @entity4 the military muscle , a liberal axis would flex its way through the @entity19			1
the @entity15 had n't had such a sense of purpose since the @entity22			1
this week , prime minister @entity23 arrived in the @entity4 with the express ambition of reviving what he and president @entity25 now call " an essential relationship			1
" so far the meeting has been cordial			0
aside from agreeing to the need to draw down @entity31 forces in @entity32 , @entity23 did his best to look interested in a basketball game in @entity34			1
he admitted afterward that he did n't have a clue what was going on and promised to explain cricket to @entity25			1
actually , cricket is very simple : whoever does n't fall asleep wins			0
nonetheless , there is an air of anxiety about the visit			0
while @entity15 is still broadly committed to the neoconservative vision of @entity6 and @entity7 , @entity25 is not			1
the tensions between the two countries have been exacerbated by a @entity15 suspicion that @entity25 simply does n't like us , that his coolness betrays a mild contempt for us and our utopian visions			1
before @entity23 's plane landed , his views on the special relationship were laid out in an interview he gave to the historian @entity57 in @entity58			1
" the only clue that @entity23 is to the manner born , " @entity57 writes , " is the seemingly effortless way he shoulders the burdens of power			2
he must be the first prime minister in history to look younger after nearly two years in office			0
" although the comparisons to @entity68 are absurdly overblown , @entity57 is right that @entity23 certainly shares some of @entity70 's worldview			2
" like @entity7 , ( @entity23 ) is drawn to the idea of military intervention where human rights as well as national interest are at stake			2
it was he , not president @entity25 , who pressed for military intervention in @entity79 last year			2
" @entity23 tells his admiring interviewer that he is on his way to @entity4 to push the case for action in @entity84			1
" ' my impulse is that i want us to do more , ' he says emphatically			0
" that 's probably the moment in the interview when @entity57 swooned			0
the encounter is significant because @entity57 is probably the world 's last neoconservative historian and @entity23 is probably the world 's last neoconservative premier ( @entity23 of @entity95 would like to be a neoconservative , but there 's no way the @entity99 are going to get rid of @entity100 )			2
to be sure , @entity23 has a habit of insisting publicly that he is not a neoconservative , while simultaneously rejecting multiculturalism , embracing " muscular liberalism , " and agitating for the removal of dictators in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity79 , and @entity84			2
his chancellor was convinced by the " excellent neoconservative case " for war in @entity112 and his education secretary wrote at the height of the @entity112 conflict " i love @entity7 [ @entity7 ]			0
" as you can tell , there 's a lot of bromance to be found on the @entity120			0
but @entity23 arrives in @entity121 at a moment when neoconservatism seems to have run its course			2
@entity25 's agenda is largely domestic , while anything he does on the world stage is contextualized by falling revenues and the emergence of new powers like @entity131 and @entity132			1
the @entity133 is marked by a cool , reserved support for allies that leaves them alone to pursue their own objectives with limited support			1
hence , @entity15 and @entity140 were allowed to take the lead in @entity79 while it will probably be left up to @entity142 to pacify @entity143			1
the result is that while allies often get what they logistically need , they rarely get the kind of enthusiastic political endorsement that they might want			0
@entity150 's frustration with @entity25 is analogous to @entity15 discomfort with the president			1
consider his many petty slights against us			0
the president removed the bust of @entity68 from the @entity157 , threatened to put a " boot on the throat " of @entity161 ( affecting the pensions of 18 million @entity15 ) , and confused @entity162 for @entity15 in a public address			2
when he met former prime minister @entity164 , he presented him with a gift of 25 dvds ranging from " @entity169 " to " @entity167 " they could n't even be played in the @entity15			1
for the @entity15 , this clash of personalities could have serious consequences			2
right now , @entity173 is behaving threateningly towards the @entity15 territory of the @entity175 , a self - governing archipelago of about 3,140 @entity15 citizens			0
yet instead of honing in on that crisis , our prime minister is using his @entity4 tour to promote the democratic transformation of the @entity182 with the use of @entity4 arms			0
meanwhile , the @entity185 has sided squarely with @entity173			0
@entity25 's reluctance to side unquestioningly with old allies means the @entity15 can not rely on his support in the future			1
we might find ourselves actively defending the self - determination of all peoples everywhere , except when they are @entity15 citizens			0
perhaps the " special relationship " between the @entity4 and @entity15 could only last as long as @entity15 was a military power worth allying with and @entity4 had a president who was a big fan of the queen			1
but in a more complex , cash - strapped world we are destined to drift apart			0
increasingly , the only thing we have in common is a mutual distrust of the @entity140			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity204 : @entity4 , @entity15 once had special relationship that has cooled with @entity25
he says @entity23 , visiting @entity4 this week , leans *neo-conservative* , @entity25 does not
he says @entity25 has domestic priorities , gives support , but leaves allies to own objectives
@entity202 : old allies do n't get same support from @entity4 as in past ; @entity142 feels frustration , too
