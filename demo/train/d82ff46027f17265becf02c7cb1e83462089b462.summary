what a difference a year makes ! last year 's address by president @entity2 to the @entity3 , the joint session of both houses of @entity7 parliament , was a rather low - key affair by international standards and the world was not exactly losing sleep over it , apart from the usual talking heads on @entity7 television and newspaper commentators who were listing the main points of the speech without much excitement			1
@entity21 was mentioned in last year 's address in the sense that @entity7 was planning to continue working with it with the view of promoting @entity21 membership of the @entity27 , as part of the bigger @entity30 project			2
there was no talk of the military build - up and on the economy nothing extraordinary was proposed			0
on the whole there was no sense of urgency present in the measures suggested			0
but since then the situation has changed dramatically , with @entity7 finding itself in a bitter stand - off with the @entity42 over the crisis in @entity21 and the new status of @entity45 that has become part of @entity7 territory			1
so the annual address delivered by @entity2 this time round was completely different in its tone and rhetoric and it was no wonder that the media , both @entity7 and foreign , were watching it carefully for any signs that would give an idea of how the @entity55 intends to deal with the new realities			1
@entity2 made it clear that @entity45 was going to remain @entity7 and if anyone had other ideas , well , tough luck			1
he also made the point of insisting that had the crisis in @entity21 not happened at all , the @entity42 would have found some other pretext to try to undermine @entity7 's economic standing			1
he even went as far as saying that this policy of containment of @entity7 by the @entity42 dates back years , decades and even centuries : obviously music to the ears of those people in @entity7 who always said trusting the @entity42 was a bad idea			2
the @entity7 president warned the @entity42 that @entity7 was prepared to defend itself militarily , should the need arise , and was not going to allow anyone to achieve military superiority over it -- unimaginable a year ago			1
on the economy @entity2 refrained from coming up with any dramatic reforms , like for , example , having a closer look at some of the past privatizations schemes and the way they had been conducted and he did not propose any radical changes with the aim of diversifying the economy that is greatly dependent on the sale of oil and gas			0
what was unusual , though , was his proposal of a one - off amnesty to @entity7 who are holding their money abroad , offering them to bring it back into the country without fear of having to explain its origins			0
it remains to be seen whether this offer will be taken by the @entity7 rich who keep their money abroad in off - shore accounts , considering that the ruble is currently in freefall			0
@entity2 did send a signal to banks and investors who were , as he put it , " rattling the rouble			0
" the message was primarily directed at state - owned companies and banks that have been lured by large returns from forex operations at a time of the ruble sliding and occasionally picking up strength			0
will they listen to him , these barons who get paid more than most top execs in @entity42 companies ? to sum it up , the @entity55 appears to have no taste for any drastic economic measures and will continue to pursue the line that @entity42 sanctions hurt not just @entity7 but the @entity42 as well			1
@entity2 has always been known for treading carefully and avoiding any sudden movements or changes in the economy , something that his critics say may have actually prevented @entity7 from having a more flexible and durable economy			2
as a result the speech disappointed both liberals and nationalists , as it failed to offer either a dramatic liberalization of the economy or any move to put it on the " mobilization rails , " as if a war was imminent			0
but on the whole the speech showed a confident president who still enjoys a very health popularity rating of over 80 % and who can expect the country to stay united behind him , considering that the impact of sanctions and falling oil prices has yet to be felt by most of the population			1
in fact , the fall of the oil prices is being offset by a weak ruble , as the government sells " black gold " in dollars and gets plenty of rubles to play with			0
but if the oil prices fall well below $ 60 per barrel , as some experts are predicting , that would be tough to stomach for @entity7 , even with its substantial hard currency reserves totaling around $ 450 billion			1
in the meantime @entity2 can afford to remain defiant and challenge the @entity42			2
but who knows how long this situation can last ?			0

@entity7 finds itself in bitter stand - off with @entity42 over @entity21 crisis , new status of @entity45
president @entity2 made it clear that @entity45 was going to remain @entity7 , says @entity171
@entity171 : @entity55 appears to have no taste for drastic economic measures
sanctions and falling oil prices yet to be felt by most @entity7 , so @entity2 still popular - @entity171
