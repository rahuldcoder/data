-- the mosque in @entity2 was crowded past capacity , with about 1,200 college students , urban hipsters and @entity6 lining the hallways and front stairs			0
they wanted to hear @entity10 , resident scholar of the @entity11 and widely considered one of the country 's most influential @entity13 , respond to @entity15 and @entity16 , who recently called @entity17 the " mother lode of bad ideas " and compared @entity13 to the @entity18			1
the lanky , blue - eyed imam , a convert originally from @entity22 , is known for tackling taboo topics and spicing his sermons with pop culture references			0
before friday 's sermon , the last time the @entity2 mosque had been this crowded , @entity10 said , was when he preached about the finale of " @entity29			1
" ( on the sunday after his sermon , @entity10 , who has extensive training in classical @entity11 learning , answered religious questions on @entity34 about " @entity35			1
" ) instead of attacking @entity16 and @entity15 , though , @entity10 challenged his fellow @entity13			1
" it 's code red , " he preached last friday , pounding the minbar for emphasis			0
" people do not like us , and we need to get with it ! " " one day we 're attacked by @entity42 , the next day we 're attacked by @entity13 who actually pay to have @entity44 ads about us , " @entity10 said			1
" i mean , that 's the level of attacks that we 're dealing with as a community and as a people			0
one brother told me , like what 's going to happen next ? it 's like a soap opera			0
" @entity10 himself has been subject to some of those attacks , as conservative media outlets have sought to tie him to @entity58 , an @entity22 man accused of beheading a co-worker , and the @entity62 brothers , suspects in the @entity64			1
@entity10 said he never met the three men			1
" it 's guilt by nonassociation , " he said with a sardonic laugh			0
at one point during his sermon last friday , a man interrupted to argue that @entity13 should n't care about what others say about them			0
but when even avowed liberals like @entity16 and @entity15 lash out against @entity17 , @entity10 said , then it 's time to worry			1
" the last bastion of support we 'll find in this country are among the liberals and some moderately conservative people , " @entity10 said			1
" what happened on that show that night was to challenge that community and its traditional support of religious minorities in this country , and if we do n't think that 's something we should be worried about , then basically we are building our own coffins			0
" those are strong words , @entity10 acknowledged in a phone interview after his sermon , which was posted on @entity93 last friday			2
but necessary ones for @entity95 , who find themselves caught between @entity97 and @entity17 like @entity98 , he said			2
" no community survives that fails to identify itself , " @entity10 said , " and right now the rhetoric and the perception of the @entity13 community , whether we believe it or not , is not very good			2
" instead , @entity105 @entity13 frequently find themselves judged by how @entity17 is practiced overseas : stories about the group calling itself @entity109 , death sentences in @entity111 , and restricted rights for women in @entity114			1
" what is constantly invoked is that @entity13 are bad because of what is happening overseas , or @entity13 are good because of what is happening overseas , " @entity10 said			2
" in other words , we are being measured and weighed and determined by events that are completely outside of our hands			0
" @entity10 challenged @entity13 to assert control of their image in three ways : by forging an @entity105 - @entity11 identity , building institutions and shifting away from the view that male scholars have the final view on the faith			1
" we need to appreciate the value of being seen as trusted ... that 's the key to having a license to speak about religion , " @entity10 said			2
" it 's a beautiful thing in this country : that if you want to talk about @entity137 , you have to be someone who has a certain type of character			0
" you can view @entity10 's full sermon here			0
in addition to his role as resident scholar at @entity146 's @entity11 society , he is also founder of the @entity147 .			0

@entity16 and @entity15 set off a *fierce* debate about @entity17
instead of attacking *critics* , one imam challenged @entity105 *muslims*
@entity10 himself has been under attack from conservatives
