-- campaign 2014 is in full swing with primary voting , and incumbents and challengers busy raising money			1
now the first task for every federal candidate in this midterm election year will be to read the @entity11 's ruling on campaign finance for a reality check			1
the 40 - page decision handed down on wednesday promises to continue a transformation over how donations and spending on elections are conducted			1
the court 's 5 - 4 ruling threw out congressionally mandated limits on the total one can give to all federal candidates in an election cycle			1
the practical effect : it would allow well - heeled donors to spread the wealth to give to more candidates and political groups			1
@entity31 : high court gives rich more say in elections but current limits on giving to an individual candidate -- $ 5,200 -- remain in place and were never at issue before the justices			1
there is disagreement on how much of an impact this narrow decision will have in money terms as billions of dollars fuel today 's campaign process overall			1
but the larger implications could be huge , played out for years to come in a variety of continuing challenges to current restrictions			0
" every time this current @entity11 has confronted a campaign finance restriction , it 's struck it down , " said @entity51 , publisher of @entity52			1
" it has been on a slow but steady march towards deregulation , towards saying that restrictions on your spending money -- say , in expenditures or in contributions to candidates -- that is a free speech right			1
" @entity66 's lament justice @entity66 sounded forlorn wednesday , lamenting in sad tones the effect of the @entity11 ruling			1
speaking from the bench , @entity66 -- supported by his three more liberal colleagues -- criticized the conservative majority for ignoring a century of efforts to blunt political corruption -- or its appearance			0
" the threat to that integrity posed by the risk of special access and influence remains real , " he said			0
the ruling " eviscerates our nation 's campaign finance laws , leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intend to resolve , " he added			1
but chief justice @entity90 , in his majority opinion , acknowledged what many a smart election lawyer knows : " because individuals ' direct contributions are limited , would - be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech " than direct contributions to office - seekers , said @entity90			1
" individuals can , for example , contribute unlimited amounts to 501 ( c ) organizations , which are not required to publicly disclose their donors			0
such organizations spent some $ 300 million on independent expenditures in the 2012 election cycle			0
" @entity90 emphasized the free - speech rights of donors and downplayed the concerns the ruling would further erode public confidence in the political system			1
" the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse , " he said			1
the man behind the ruling @entity122 is an electrical engineer by trade , but grassroots politics may be his true passion			2
the @entity127 native has worked for years with his local @entity128 in @entity129 , and is chairman of @entity131 , a so - called " super pac " that " promotes conservative @entity128 ' time - proven messages and effective solutions			2
" his success in business and a willingness to put his money into @entity128 coffers set him at the center of the politically tricky @entity11 fight			1
he equates his donations to " core political speech			0
" @entity122 says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants , so long as no one candidate gets more than the $ 2,600 per election limit			0
he supports those individual controls , but " what does n't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates , because somehow my giving money to ( @entity157 rep. ) @entity156 of @entity127 could corrupt ( former rep. ) @entity159 of @entity160 , " he told @entity0			2
" that 's just nutty , but that 's what the powers - that - be want : to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union pacs have , " he said			1
but backers of continued congressional regulation do not see it that way			0
" the reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness , so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations , we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate , " said @entity173 , a prominent @entity175 fundraiser			1
" that 's why there are limitations , so that everyone has an equal or fair voice in the process			2
not only are our elections being put up for auction , these donors are making an investment in the democratic system for their own agenda and we taxpayers have to foot the bill , " he said			0
fundamental debate the competing arguments are stark : supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics			1
opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association			0
the current case deals with direct political contributions			0
but it continues a trend that culminated in the separate " @entity216 " high court ruling from 2010 , easing long - standing restrictions on " independent spending " by corporations , labor unions , and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns			1
its impact put corporations on the same free - speech footing as wealthy individuals , who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely and independently on behalf of federal candidates			1
that and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in @entity231 have led to a proliferation of so - called " super pacs " -- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses , unions , and advocacy groups			2
these super pacs are independent political organizations operating as " 527s , " named after the tax code governing their operation			0
they can not contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party			0
limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place , the focus in part of the current @entity122 appeal			1
some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased , or even unlimited , aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the " super pacs			2
" all pacs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates , legislation , or ballot measures			1
the difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes , and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend			0
regular pacs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties , while super pacs can not			2
with a resounding win at the high court , wealthy donors like @entity122 -- whether @entity282 , @entity128 , or @entity283 -- could in theory contribute a maximum $ 3.6 million to the national and state parties , and the 450 or so @entity286 and @entity287 candidates expected to run in 2014			2
@entity288 for the conservative majority court was rejecting claims by the law 's supporters that it had a permissible goal of preventing political corruption or the appearance of it			2
another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect , or only involve a relative few well - heeled givers			1
figures from the @entity303 for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $ 48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates			2
almost 1,700 contributors forked over the maximum limit to party committees , which added up to more than $ 100 million			0
loosening those limits , say opponents of the law , would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally			2
lax enforcement but the @entity11 has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit			1
and critics accuse regulators of having a generally lax enforcement stance , particularly for independent advocacy groups			1
the @entity326 will now be tasked with taking this high court opinion and crafting new rules to ease limits on aggregate spending			2
unlike in " @entity216 , " the big winners may be harder to discern			0
certainly individual donors seeking to expand their election portfolio have more choices			0
but as @entity90 noted , other big - move avenues exist to funnel money to outside groups willing to spend freely			0
and political parties certainly will have more money to spend			0
that worries many supporters of more regulation			0
" the court opens another loophole by allowing our political parties to be further corrupted by big - money contributions from special interests , " said @entity343 , president of the @entity344 of the @entity157 " the party and @entity347 systems now become a huge funnel for corrupting elected officials across the country			0
" but @entity122 argues that characterizing the legal fight as between " good " and " bad " simply blurs the truth			0
" getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy -- it is about practicing democracy , " he said			0
" this case is about freedom -- your freedom and my freedom -- to express ourselves openly and fully within our political system			0
and if there is one thing that we @entity157 believe with all our hearts , it is that freedom never corrupts			0
" the case is @entity375 ( 12 - 536 ) .			0
