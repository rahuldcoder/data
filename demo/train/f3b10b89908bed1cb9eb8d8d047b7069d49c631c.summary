-- the bombings at the @entity2 have brought attention to " pressure cooker bombs			1
" improvised explosive devices can be constructed using everyday items , and those made with pressure cookers have been around for 40 years			2
the @entity10 @entity9 has issued repeated warnings against ieds made with pressure cookers			1
ieds have been used in numerous attacks in the @entity10 , most notably the april 1995 @entity17 bombing ; the may 2010 attack in @entity19 ; and failed attempts by the @entity21 and the @entity22			1
some experts view the aircraft used to strike the @entity25 and the @entity26 on 9/11 as the largest ieds ever created			2
abroad , @entity28 , the perpetrator of the july 2011 attack in @entity30 , @entity31 , described the ied he detonated -- before killing 77 people at a youth camp -- as a " marketing tool " for his extremist views			2
ieds are a global threat and have become an effective weapon for those who advance their cause through terror and violence			1
for the past several years , excluding @entity45 and @entity46 , there are on average , three ied incidents each day			0
the @entity26 's @entity49 has an even higher estimate of 500 ied incidents per month , again excluding @entity46 and @entity45			0
historically , ieds have been used in a variety of situations , including conflict and post-conflict environments ( @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 and the @entity62 ) ; illegal drug operations ( @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 ) ; insurgencies ( @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 ) ; election - related violence ( @entity73 , @entity70 and @entity74 ) ; religious crises ( @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity70 ) ; ethnic conflicts ( @entity70 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 ) ; and other notable acts of terror ( @entity83 , @entity31 , @entity69 , @entity84 and @entity10 )			1
the @entity2 attack exemplifies what some parts of the world experience on a regular basis			1
according to our estimates , in the 10 days before the @entity2 , ieds took the lives of more than 100 people in seven countries			1
and in the past 60 days , 64 people were killed in a @entity77 incident in february and 44 people were killed in a @entity70 incident in march			0
the @entity102 attack also cast a spotlight on the severity of injuries that result from ied use			0
thousands of @entity10 service members , veterans and civilians around the world endure the consequences of these horrific injuries			1
ieds cause the top four injuries to veterans , including hearing loss , traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress			0
according to the @entity122 , approximately 34 % of those injured by @entity121 blasts suffer dual sensory loss of vision and hearing in addition to the well - documented physical wounds such as loss of limbs and other permanent physical disabilities			1
treating these injuries is a challenge because the @entity10 @entity26 inadequately shares blast trauma research with the @entity134 and other organizations			2
to date , the domestic and international threat of @entity121 has been ignored			1
no nation has formally condemned the use of ieds			0
while the @entity141 annually issues a resolution condemning landmines , it has never issued a resolution condemning ieds			0
members of the @entity146 have recently raised the alarm on this threat			0
in may 2012 , a bipartisan group of 92 members of the @entity151 sent a letter to president @entity153 calling for a unified @entity10 strategy and international action against @entity121			1
so far , no adequate response from the administration has been received			0
to fill this vacuum of inaction , i founded the @entity161 in an effort to push for the reduction of ied use and the trafficking of ied precursor materials			0
through a coalition of public , private and military efforts , we can reduce ied networks and prevent ied networks from forming			0
a purely military approach has failed to stop ieds in @entity46 and @entity45			0
the solution to this dilemma , proposed by the @entity161 against @entity121 , will be comprehensive , involving public , private and military partners			2
finally , the broader global community must come together and take meaningful action against ieds and those who use them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : pressure cooker bombs , like the one used in @entity2 , are not new
@entity184 : ieds are effective for those who want to *inflict* terror and violence on people
he says to date , the domestic and international threat of @entity121 has been ignored
@entity184 : the @entity10 and the global community must take meaningful action against @entity121
