@entity0 claimed its first @entity3 title in 23 years after beating @entity4 9 - 8 in a dramatic penalty shootout in the final sunday			1
the winning penalty was scored by @entity0 goalkeeper @entity7 after he had saved the preceding effort from his @entity4 counterpart @entity9			1
it was almost a carbon copy of the 1992 final when the @entity12 beat @entity4 on spot kicks after a goalless draw and extra time			1
the 35 - year - old @entity7 , who replaced the injured @entity16 for the final , had been beset by cramp during the lengthy shootout , but mustered the energy to fire his kick past the unfortunate @entity9 to spark wild celebrations by his team			1
@entity4 had looked set to win its first @entity3 crown since 1982 when it took a 2 - 0 lead in the shootout after @entity29 's new signing @entity27 and teammate @entity30 had failed to convert their kicks			1
but the @entity4 failed to take full advantage as @entity33 saw his effort saved by @entity7 and @entity35 sent his effort wide			1
with all the remaining outfield players successful with their kicks , it was left to the respective goalkeepers to play out the final drama			0
the match in @entity42 in @entity43 was watched by the country 's president @entity44 , @entity47 president @entity46 and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) president @entity50			0
they saw a tactical affair which rarely reached the heights expected of a match between two powerhouses of @entity57 football , played in a stadium less than full			0
the elephants of @entity0 made the better start but failed to forge a clear cut opening as the supply to star striker @entity27 was restricted			2
@entity4 came closest to an opening as @entity65 's snap shot from the edge of the area rattled the post and late in the first half @entity69 's effort clipped the outside of the near post			2
further chances in the second half and during added times were again limited as both teams appeared to settle for the lottery of penalty kicks			0
the triumph is the second in three @entity3 finals for @entity0 coach @entity83 , who led @entity84 to the 2012 title , ironically with @entity0 as the victims after a penalty shootout			1
@entity88 , the first man to achieve this feat , understood what the triumph meant to the winning nation			0
" we dedicate this win to the @entity0 people , " he told gathered reporters			2
" football has this magic element in that it unites all the ethnic groups -- all the people who perhaps do n't think the same way			0
" @entity0 is more than delighted today and that 's the most important thing			2
" his opposite @entity102 also praised his beaten side , claiming that reach the final alone was a big achievement			0
" we were the better team but we did not create enough chances ... @entity4 can be proud of this young team , " said the former @entity110 manager .			0
