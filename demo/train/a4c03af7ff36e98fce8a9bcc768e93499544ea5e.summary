@entity0 -- what do zombies and androids have in common ? they 're almost human , but not quite			1
that disconnect is creepy , in a way that scientists are searching to understand			0
the uncanny valley is the idea that as a robot 's appearance becomes more and more humanlike , we do n't always respond to it more positively			1
rather , there 's a point on the scale between robot and human where we are repulsed			2
if it 's mechanical but not entirely human , a robot seems disturbing			2
why would that be ? it would make sense that as human likeness increases in a robot , so would our comfort with it			1
but on a graph showing that relationship , there 's a " valley " where this familiarity dips down into creepiness , and then comes back up again with more human characteristics			1
you may have experienced feeling this while watching animated movies that incorporate humanlike forms			1
it 's also the reason that you might get freaked out by clowns or by photos of people with extreme plastic surgeries who do n't look quite real anymore			0
our brains come to an impasse when we see something that resembles a member of our species but just does n't make the cut			2
meet the huggable , semi-robotic and semi-creepy pillow phone some animators sidestep the issue : in the movie " @entity57 , " for example , the main character has eyes but is not very humanlike otherwise ; he is clearly a robot			2
his friend , @entity64 , looks like a white shape with eyes			0
both express emotions clearly but do n't try to mimic the human shape or form			2
and hal 9000 from " 2001 : a @entity75 " is just a red camera eye , but it too conveys feelings			0
but when you get more humanlike , things get weird			2
some reviewers were put off by the characters in the film " @entity82 , " for instance			0
then there are the @entity84 in " @entity85 , " who have many physical human characteristics in addition to morphed features and tails			1
but they are also blue , creating a sense of " otherness " that may have made them less distasteful to viewers -- in other words , they were sufficiently un-human			0
@entity98 , professor at the @entity99 , is using cutting - edge brain science to understand this strange quirk of human nature			1
although the idea of the uncanny valley has been observed , there has not been much rigorous scientific experimental work on it , partly because it 's hard to get at the heart of the matter objectively			1
" even if we do n't actually define it in words , we may be able to find signals for it in the brain , " @entity98 said			2
@entity98 and colleagues published a study last year using functional magnetic resonance imagining ( @entity120 ) , looking at what 's happening in the brain that might explain the uncanny valley phenomenon			1
they hypothesized that , at least in part , the effect might result from a violation of the brain 's predictions			2
when we anticipate one thing but see another , we get an error , and that error makes us shy away from the thing we 're viewing			0
the researchers showed 20 participants some video clips of three " actors " moving in the same ways : a human , an android modeled after the human , and a stripped - down robot ( the same android without its humanlike form )			1
although this is a small sample of people , it is typical for neuroimaging studies , which are expensive and time - intensive			0
something interesting emerged in the results : " the network that normally processes your body movements is more active when you view an android , " compared with when you look at a stripped - down robot or a human , @entity98 explains			2
this could be because the brain has to combine conflicting information , she said			2
" your brain 's gon na be like , ' hey , wait a minute , you told me this was a human , and now this area told me that this is not moving like a human			1
so , i have to really compute that , ' " she said			0
" that 's what we think the uncanny valley might be partially caused by , and we have seen some brain activity that looks like that			1
" the uncanny valley phenomenon was put forth in an article in " energy " in 1970 by @entity176 robotics expert @entity175			1
but before that , @entity177 wrote about " the uncanny " in a 1906 essay , and @entity181 followed up 13 years later			0
yet the idea is largely based on anecdotes , and researchers such as @entity185 , associate professor of human - computer interaction at @entity187 , are working on experiments to hone in on possible explanations			0
@entity185 briefly worked with @entity98 in @entity176			0
@entity190 sees improvisation through machine 's eyes in his view , the uncanny valley effect has to do with a mismatch in features of a single animation or robot , with some parts appearing much more humanlike than others			1
for instance , when a very human - looking head is placed on an obviously mechanical body , that can be creepy			0
so can a human face with robotic eyes			0
" when there are elements that are both human or nonhuman , this mismatch can produce an eerie sensation in the brain , " @entity185 said			1
" it 's when different parts of the brain are coming to different conclusions at the same time			0
" there are other factors that may play in , however			0
the uncanny valley effect could have to do with uncertainty about whether a robotic character is truly alive or dead , and even play into our deep - seated fears of death			1
alternatively , it may be part of cognitive dissonance , which happens when a person 's beliefs are not in line with their behaviors -- for instance , a smoker who berates other smokers			0
from an evolutionary perspective , humans have developed an aversion to sickness , and a creepy - looking almost - human might tap into our internal system that warns us against sources of disease			0
in relation , we evolved to choose mates who are healthy , and weird robots may set off the same warning bells that told our ancestors to stay away from unfit sexual partners			0
@entity185 's current focus is on the uncanny valley with respect to empathy : that is , is the uncanny valley phenomenon related to a person 's difficulty in identifying with particular computer - animated or robotic characters in films ? does it relate to the impression that these characters are somehow " soulless , " and in what ways ? @entity98 's ongoing studies make use of electroencephalography , or @entity266 , which measures electrical activity along the scalp			1
while @entity120 tells where in the brain activity occurs , @entity266 is better for looking at when -- that is , when in viewing agents with different degrees of humanness do people 's brain patterns change			1
@entity266 is also much more portable and less expensive			1
rather than a big scanner , it involves a cap worn on a person 's head			0
researchers may be able to understand the @entity266 patterns associated with the uncanny valley effect , and people 's comfort with various robotic forms			1
eventually , this information could be used to help robot developers or animators who do n't want their creations to scare people			0
@entity293 , compelling social robots and their creators " instead of asking somebody , ' do you like this robot ? ' we could get that information a lot more directly , and faster perhaps , if we can develop these technologies , " she said			0
have you ever experienced the uncanny valley effect ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1

uncanny valley phenomenon : when humanlike forms make us *uncomfortable*
this may be pronounced when some features are human and others not
brain imaging and @entity266 are being used to study the uncanny valley
