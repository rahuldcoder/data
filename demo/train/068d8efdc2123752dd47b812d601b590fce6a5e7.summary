-- " i 'm so happy that i do n't have to be an @entity2 customer			0
" posted to a @entity6 message board this morning , one user 's feelings nail the sentiment among consumers following wednesday 's announcement that the @entity10 is suing to block @entity2 's proposed acquisition of the @entity12 -- owned wireless network			1
@entity6 users generally responded positively to the news that they would n't be seeing the @entity2 death star on their cellphone bills anytime soon			0
riffing on the oft - bemoaned shortcomings of both networks , one @entity19 reader proposed an unfortunate merger scenario : " @entity2 's zero - bars reception merged with @entity6 's customer service			1
i think the result might just collapse into a black hole of suck			0
" @entity2 has long championed its proposed merger of @entity6 as being beneficial to the wireless customers of both networks			2
the company claims it will improve wireless service for @entity2 and @entity6 customers , expand 4g coverage to more of the country and , most recently , add a significant number of jobs to the @entity38 workforce			0
but in the @entity10 's eyes -- and anecdotally those of @entity6 's customer base as well -- the costs of the merger may outweigh the benefits			1
" the combination of @entity2 and @entity6 would result in tens of millions of consumers all across the @entity38 facing higher prices , fewer choices and lower quality products for mobile wireless services , " said deputy attorney general @entity44 in the justice filing			0
not to mention some of the concessions existing @entity6 customers would have to make if the merger were to go through			0
@entity2 has repeatedly stated it planned to use @entity6 's 1700 - @entity55 spectrum for its eventual @entity57 deployment			1
that would ultimately make @entity6 customers buy new phones that could function on @entity2 's network -- unless , that is , you 're okay with edge network service			1
those least happy about the @entity10 's actions are , of course , @entity2 and @entity6			2
in the past year , @entity6 has seen a steady decline in profits as @entity6 customer contracts have been reduced by nearly a million subscribers			1
if @entity12 were able to sell off @entity6 to @entity2 for $ 39 billion , the @entity69 firm could then use that money to invest in its @entity72 business			0
not to mention a successful blocking of the merger would prevent @entity2 's dreams of becoming the largest wireless telecommunications network in the @entity38 , surpassing @entity77 as the reigning champ and leaving @entity79 in the dust			2
of course , if the lawsuit fails to block the merger , today 's customer rejoicing could lend itself to tomorrow 's mass customer departures : " if @entity87 is able to acquire them , " wrote one @entity6 subscriber , " then i am outta here so fast they wo n't even know i existed			1
