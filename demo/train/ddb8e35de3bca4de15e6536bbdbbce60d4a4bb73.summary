you can rest when you 're dead , as the saying goes			1
and in @entity4 , your eternal slumber is done in style			2
burying your loved ones in intricate , beautifully crafted -- and , at times a little surreal -- caskets is a common tradition in some parts of the the @entity11 nation			2
based in @entity13 , a small town in @entity4 's central region , self - taught carpenter @entity12 has made a name for himself with his eye - catching style of coffins			1
" i love playing with the wood , " he says			2
" i did n't study it in the school -- i just love carving			2
" the plucky , young artisan has always had a passion for woodwork and inspired by artists before him such as @entity28 and @entity29 , his startup began to take shape			2
" i saw a designed coffin somewhere and i said : ' no , i have to do this ' and i forced my parents to push me into it			2
" by 2007 , @entity12 had opened the @entity35			1
seven years on , and the craftsman has found big success thanks to his fantastical funerary boxes			0
from chickens to sewing machines burial rites in @entity4 are incredibly important in honoring ancestry			1
in a country where the passing of a loved one is often celebrated with a party - like fervor , the elaborate coffin art allows mourning family members and friends to send their dearly departed off to the afterlife in style			0
@entity12 adds : " it 's a special coffin that talks a lot about the deceased			1
but also for the family who sees it to as a last gift to the deceased			1
" often designs for these figurative coffins reflect the deceased 's vocation or personality			1
perhaps if you worked as a farmer , a chicken casket could be for you			0
what about a fashion designer ? well , a sewing machine , what else ? prices for a custom - made coffin from @entity71 vary due to design request , size and where the casket needs to be shipped to			1
" when it 's local , it could be around 1,000 @entity4 cedi ( around $ 300 ) and above			0
exported ones are $ 1000 or more			0
" eye - catching and strange creations over the years , @entity71 has heard some weird , wonderful and downright bizarre requests for casket creations			1
yet , whatever the request , he does n't judge a family 's choice -- he just sees it as a challenge			0
" i just think of it and am done			0
i always see my orders as normal no matter how weird it is , " explains the artisan coffin maker			0
he adds : " a family came here some two years ago , and they said our late mother used to be a midwife and we want a designed coffin , something that can talk about her work -- and i came up with a pregnant woman who is about to deliver and it was a fantastic piece			1
" @entity12 has also constructed a variety of fisherman - inspired pieces for departed sea workers including canoes , fishing boats , nets and of course , a variety of fish			1
today @entity71 employs six full - time staff			0
but with an increased workforce , other problems arise			0
" like today , for example , we have a lot of work here and i do n't have a big shop ... " he adds : " sometimes the materials we use -- it can be scarce for a while and we do n't have enough money to gather or to store materials for many years			0
" however , @entity71 is optimistic about the future , " in the next five years i want to extend my shop and even the workers or apprentices i have , so that when somebody orders something you can deliver days before its time			0

@entity12 has been designing coffins since 2007
his creations reflect the *professions* of the deceased
