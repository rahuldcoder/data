now the @entity9 is launching its # @entity11 initiative , a series of online video chats meant to " highlight the future of science , technology and innovation in the @entity18			1
" the first one happened thursday at 2 pm et on the @entity9 's google+ page and included four leading thinkers in science and technology			1
