" @entity21 attorney @entity40 said in a written statement			0
" officers who try to obstruct justice when their misconduct faces exposure , rather than cooperating in the investigation , should realize that they will face even more severe punishment			0

the informant , however , denied ever having been to @entity7 's home , leading to probes by local and federal authorities as well as the breakup and reorganization of the @entity0 police narcotics unit			1

@entity11 also cooperated " to a more limited extent , " the statement said , adding that both @entity16 and @entity11 's sentences were reduced because of their cooperation			2
prosecutors have said that the officers regularly presented false information to obtain warrants and that they cut corners to make more time for lucrative side jobs providing additional security to businesses , often while on duty , and receiving cash payments			0

" their routine violations of the @entity140 led to the death of an innocent citizen			0
