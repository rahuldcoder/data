@entity0 -- in what one member of @entity4 called " a charade , " a couple that showed up at president @entity9 's first state dinner -- uninvited , the @entity2 claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a @entity2 committee wednesday			1
under questioning from @entity15 chairman rep. @entity14 , @entity16 , and others , @entity13 repeated over and over again , " on the advice of counsel , i respectfully assert my right to remain silent and decline to answer your question			1
" the @entity24 ' attorney notified the committee in december that because of a pending investigation by federal prosecutors , they would not answer questions about how they gained entry to the @entity2 on november 24 , despite not being on the guest list to attend that night 's state dinner for the prime minister of @entity32			1
in a brief statement that opened the often - contentious hearing , @entity13 chastised the committee for requiring the couple to appear despite having been told the two would invoke their @entity37 right against self - incrimination if subpoenaed			1
that , he alleged , is against the ethical rules of the @entity0 bar			0
he incensed some committee members by reiterating the couple 's respect for @entity46 troops , the @entity47 and the president			1
" you have shown effrontery here , " said @entity49 , @entity50			0
he called it " an abomination " that the @entity24 would invoke the name of those in uniform " and suggest that somehow what you do provides support to them			2
" " the @entity60 protects fools , " @entity49 said			0
" the @entity60 protects stupidity			0
the @entity60 protects errant thought			0
" " this was not a hearing looking for information , " the couple 's attorney , @entity66 , told reporters after the hearing			1
" this was an opportunity for a public flogging			0
" " i think today 's procedure is a charade , " rep. @entity75 , @entity76 , said in the hearing , referring to the @entity24 ' refusal to answer questions			1
other committee members also lambasted the couple , alleging they put their own desire for celebrity before the security of the president and are wasting the committee 's time and taxpayers ' money			0
" i do n't respect your right to take the @entity37			0
not at all , " rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , told the couple			0
" were you there ? " he asked @entity13 , referring to the dinner			1
when @entity13 began , " on the advice ... " @entity94 interrupted him , asking , " are you here right now ? you gon na get an answer from your attorney on that ? " @entity94 noted the committee had offered to allow the couple to speak behind closed doors			1
after conferring with his attorney , @entity13 said , " yes , but you did n't offer us any legal protection			1
" @entity13 's wife , @entity110 , also invoked her @entity37 right under questioning by committee members , but replied , " yes , " when asked if she would return to testify after the investigation has concluded			1
asked by @entity14 whether the state dinner appearance was part of a " reality tv stunt , " @entity13 said the couple was under a non-disclosure agreement and " should not discuss matters related to the television matter			1
" the @entity24 contend they were told they could attend the program to honor @entity32 's prime minister , but the @entity2 says they were not invited and were not on the guest list for the exclusive affair			1
best said after the hearing the couple received " representations that they relied upon " that they were invited guests			1
two @entity47 investigators were privy to this information from a person who knows the @entity24 , he said			1
" this was not a stunt , and they committed no criminal act			0
" there was no connection to any reality tv show , he said , and the @entity24 were not seeking publicity			2
the couple has turned down multiple offers from the media to be " rewarded handsomely , " he added			0
" whatever the real story is , it 's on the other side of the gates of the @entity2 , not with the @entity24 , " @entity66 said			1
" they thought they were invited			0
... if it was a misunderstanding , it was a misunderstanding caused by representatives of the government			0
" @entity13 also noted in his opening statement that the couple 's attorneys have offered to provide information to the committee , but that offer was declined by @entity14 's staff			2
" those offers are not satisfactory , " @entity14 said			0
" these lawyers were not at the state dinner and have no firsthand knowledge of the facts			1
" @entity13 also said the couple has provided phone records , e-mails and other documentary evidence to the committee			2
there also was criticism of the @entity2 in wednesday 's hearing			2
rep. @entity175 , @entity177 - @entity176 , said the @entity2 " continues to stonewall " and will not allow social secretary @entity178 to testify on the security breach			2
@entity9 press secretary @entity180 has said that allowing a @entity2 staff member to testify before a congressional committee would violate the @entity60 's separation of powers			2
" i do n't know what the @entity2 is trying to hide , " @entity175 said			2
" obviously , something went wrong , and it originated with the @entity2 , not the @entity47			1
" @entity47 director @entity189 , in previous testimony before the committee , took responsibility for the security breach , acknowledging that " appropriate procedures were not followed			2
" rep. @entity193 , @entity194 , said wednesday he thought it was " unfortunate " that @entity189 " had to take all that grief from us			0
" " i hold you responsible for it , " he told the @entity24			0
" your actions ... made a mockery of this country , a mockery of our security , " rep. @entity200 , @entity201 , told the couple			0
" i 'm saddened , and i 'm disappointed , and i 'm outraged			0
" @entity66 reiterated afterward the @entity24 do not want the events surrounding the dinner to detract from the " extraordinary institution " of the @entity47			1
