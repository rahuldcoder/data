-- @entity2 pirates are notorious for being behind a spate hijackings on the high seas but their activities have also exacerbated food shortages in the @entity7 , a senior official from the @entity9 has said			1
professor @entity10 , who fulfills a dual role as the bank 's chief economist and vice president , says that piracy has both prevented and delayed vital food aid from being delivered to @entity2			1
this has worsened the humanitarian situation inside the country which -- alongside neighboring @entity20 and @entity21 -- is experiencing one of the most severe droughts and subsequent food shortages in living memory , he explains			1
some 12.4 million people in the @entity7 currently require humanitarian assistance as a result of food shortages , the @entity26 estimates			1
" [ @entity31 ] affects the transit of food quickly , where it 's needed by refugees , " @entity10 says			1
" it also brings up the costs of transporting the food and it goes beyond that into tourism , into the exploitation of hydro - carbons ... the issue around fishing and so forth , " he adds			2
" but more urgently it is about delivery of food that is being affected			2
" @entity10 cites the lack of a respected or powerful central authority in @entity2 as a key factor in the rise of pirate activity in and around its waters recent years			1
the country has been without a government since 1991 , meaning there is a lack of security and infrastructure that would allow the safe passage of aid to areas worst affected by the droughts			0
individual charities and agencies are even being forced to negotiate with armed groups or offer monetary incentives to get help into the country -- at considerable risk to their own staff -- @entity10 says			1
" unfortunately the government is at the core of this [ issue ] and without a government you ca n't police			0
there 's no military , organized military to provide security , " he says			0
" this is impacting on the ability of anyone to help the people in @entity2 , so at the end of the day we just have to deal with the governance			0
that is the core of everything , " he adds			0
@entity10 also highlights the lack of protection offered to @entity2 fisherman from international bodies such as @entity94 in preventing illegal fishing in @entity2 waters as another major contributory factor towards piracy			1
large scale fishing operations from countries across @entity101 and @entity102 have popped up illegally in @entity2 waters in recent years with no coastguard or navy to stop them , @entity10 says			2
this has depleted fish stocks and forced many @entity2 fisherman , with no government to petition or act on their behalf , to take up piracy as an alternative source of income , he adds			0
" certainly there 's a sense that this was initially a reaction to foreign ships coming in to fish illegally , depleting the stock of fish , " says @entity10			2
" these fishermen then took the law into their own hands and said look we 'll start hijacking ships as a way of getting back			0
then it became an easy business , a way of life , they got hooked onto it			0
" " that issue has not been addressed , at least not from the @entity2 's point of view , " he adds			0
@entity10 explains that a lack of urgency from international and regional bodies to address these developments as they occurred has led to the situation snowballing into the key regional issue it is today			1
in recent years piracy has caused millions of dollars worth of damage to local tourism , fishing and shipping industries , as well as impacting on food security , he says			2
but with @entity146 relying the high seas to transport roughly 80 % of its goods -- largely due poor roads and a lack of travel infrastructure on the continent -- @entity10 says it is vital for governments and international bodies to come together to address the root causes of piracy			1
he cites giving support to @entity2 to address its governance issue and introducing fair legislation that protects @entity2 fishing waters as key first steps in what will likely be a long and drawn out process			0
by doing so however , @entity10 believes that the region will become a much safer place			2
addressing the issue of food security meanwhile , will become much simpler , he adds .			0
