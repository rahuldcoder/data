-- @entity1 holds a special place in the tennis calendar , an elegant tournament rich with tradition , style and sporting majesty			1
the modern era of the men 's game there has been defined by the legacy of @entity13 , who won a record seven titles in eight years			1
however , it was not exactly love at first sight for the confident young @entity18 , who -- despite winning his first grand slam at the age of 19 -- suffered early exits in his first three visits to the famous grass - court venue			1
" i did n't like grass at all and when people ask me about grass and when i first went over there , i tell them i hated @entity1			1
i hated the surface , " he told @entity0			2
calendar of the court : the six seasons of the tennis year but , speaking to @entity37 's @entity36 , a fellow @entity1 champion , @entity13 quickly qualified his remarks			1
" i loved @entity1 and what it meant , but the surface felt uncomfortable			2
i just did n't like it , i was a hard - court guy , a @entity41 kid			0
" on hard courts the ball is going to be just there , but with grass you have to adjust , so the first two , three years i had to adjust and came out with a bad attitude			2
" @entity13 paid tribute to his former coach @entity49 , who tragically lost his life to brain cancer in 1996			0
the ' owner ' of @entity1 " he helped me			0
i had these long swings , and he shortened them up and told me my attitude had to be more positive at @entity1 , " the 40 - year - old recalled			2
the fruits of their labors came in 1992 when @entity13 advanced to the semifinals before being beaten by big - serving @entity60 @entity59 , who subsequently lost to @entity61 in the final			2
@entity63 was just around the corner the following year			0
" mentally i felt better			0
by ' 92 i felt really comfortable , i was the owner of the place for the next seven years			0
" only a quarterfinal defeat to eventual winner @entity68 in 1996 interrupted an incredible run which saw @entity13 claim seven of the next eight @entity1 crowns			1
his 1999 victory in the final over @entity61 in straight sets was rated one of his best performances as he demolished his arch - rival			0
" that sixth @entity1 ( title ) against @entity61 i got in the zone , " he said			0
" i felt if i was serving well , i would do well , get into the net , be aggressive			0
it was bit more high risk , i was okay with that			0
" in 2001 , @entity13 was beaten in the fourth round by a youthful @entity86 as he sought an eighth @entity1 title , and he retired the following year after winning the @entity88 in fairytale fashion			1
he is still involved in tennis and plays the occasional exhibition or seniors @entity94 event , but spends most of his time with his wife @entity96 and their two children at his home in @entity41			0
@entity86 domination @entity86 began his era of domination in 2003 , but the 16 - time grand slam champion is still one short of the @entity1 record held by @entity13 -- whose tally is matched only by the seven won by @entity107 's @entity106 in the tournament 's formative years of the 1880s			1
@entity13 believes that the @entity111 maestro can still claim another , but he may struggle with world no. 1 @entity114 -- who he was to face in friday 's semifinals -- and @entity116 in their prime			2
" @entity86 needs to find a way to be creative , stick to his game and serve and volley now and again , " @entity13 said			1
" he 's won 16 majors in a certain way , he 's not going to change now			0
" the task of giving @entity86 advice falls to his current coach @entity125 , who also guided @entity13 in the latter part of his career			1
the @entity18 acknowledges the difference in their playing styles but told @entity0 that both shared a key ingredient to success			2
" both these guys are superstars in regards to handling pressure , " @entity125 said			0
@entity13 accepts that his style of big serving and volleying at @entity1 is from a bygone era , and he regrets its passing			1
" it 's sad to see @entity1 today with the players staying back , with the balls being different , but grass is grass -- you can still get into the net but it 's a lost art , and it 's unfortunate			1

@entity13 admits he " hated " playing on @entity1 's grass in his early years
@entity18 legend took time to adapt to the bounce of the @entity156 surface
@entity13 won seven titles from 1993 - 2000 as he dominated at @entity160
@entity86 is still bidding to equal the men 's record held by @entity13
