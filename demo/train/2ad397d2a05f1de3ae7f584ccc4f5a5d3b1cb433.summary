@entity0 -- sunday could not have begun any better for @entity3 's ruling @entity2 , the party of @entity4			1
as the autumn sun rose and warmed the seats of the 95,000 - seater , calabash - shaped @entity8 , supporters poured in from across the country			0
by mid-morning the stadium was packed to the rafters			0
the beautiful , melodic songs used by activists through the years of struggle against apartheid until 1994 when @entity4 was voted into power filled the stadium			1
party activists crowed about the party 's pulling power : no other political party in the country has yet managed to fill the stadium			2
this was the last political rally before new @entity3 's fifth democratic elections are held			1
all the major parties staged political rallies , but the @entity2 sought to present a show of force as it attempts to swat off challenges from the relentless opposition @entity34 and the upstart , left - wing @entity27 launched a few months ago by expelled former @entity37 leader @entity36			1
then the @entity2 's leader , president @entity38 , rose to address the packed stadium			1
within half an hour of his plowing into a statistics - laden speech , nearly half the stadium seats were empty			0
a laborious and monotonous speaker at best , @entity38 struggled through the speech , igniting only a few rounds of applause from die - hard supporters in the hour - long delivery			1
it was only at the end , when he burst into his election signature song @entity52 ( " this road is @entity54 , " as opposed to his other favorite , " @entity58 " ) that some energy returned to the crowd			0
the scandal - soaked @entity38 -- who was booed in front of @entity62 president @entity61 , @entity64 's @entity63 and other world leaders at the same stadium on december 10 last year during the memorial service for @entity4 -- has become the most divisive figure in @entity3 politics today and the pivot around which electioneering and questions about the country 's future have swung			1
as he spoke , a scandal about the national ombudsman 's report into how he unduly benefited from the building of a $ 25 million palace for him at his rural @entity81 village was intensifying			0
a $ 200 million town is also being built near his home , claimed a newspaper			0
other scandals have wracked his administration since he came to power in 2009			1
questions continue to be raised about his closeness to an @entity91 family that employs his son and wife and which landed a private jet filled with 200 wedding guests from @entity91 at a top - security military base ; his evasion of more than 700 charges of fraud and corruption due to the influence of intelligence services and numerous suspect business connections by members of his family			0
in all these cases , @entity38 has said that he did not know and that people abused his name to gain favor			2
yet , despite the cocktail of scandals and gaffes that engulf @entity38 , there is no doubt here that the @entity2 will win the election on wednesday and @entity38 will be returned to the presidency			1
according to a @entity3 @entity122 poll released on may 4 , the @entity2 will get 63.9 % of the vote , down from the 65.9 % the party won in the 2009 general election			1
the opposition da will increase its support to 23.7 % while @entity36 's @entity27 party is expected to get 4.7 %			0
if there is so much disenchantment with @entity38 , then , why is he headed for victory ? history , for one			2
in @entity38 's speech on sunday he went through a long list of achievements by the @entity2 in the 20 years of democracy			1
it is an impressive roll call : ubiquitous access to water , electricity and health services			0
about 16 million people are now on social grants while there is universal access to no - fee schools			0
the dignity of full citizenship has been restored to blacks like me , a powerful , deep act that resonates with many			0
we still enjoy a free and vigorous press , despite iniquitous new legislation waiting to be enacted by @entity38 that will criminalize much newsgathering			2
yet this narrative -- which the @entity2 has harnessed in its election slogan : " we have a good story to tell " -- is incomplete			2
violent strikes over poor services are on a sharp increase , with the @entity162 reporting a total of 569 protests in three months in @entity3 's wealthiest province , @entity166			1
about 122 of these turned violent			0
reports of corruption are on the increase , with @entity171 's 2013 global @entity170 showing that @entity3 has dropped 17 places since @entity38 came to power in 2009			1
@entity3 is currently ranked 72 out of 175 countries			2
the economy is taking a beating under @entity38 , with paltry gdp growth of 1.9 % last year and unemployment at 24.1 % ( narrowly defined ) or a staggering 36 % if one includes those who have given up looking for work			2
the @entity27 has found fertile ground among these disaffected youth , with an estimated 30,000 young people turning up to listen to @entity36 giving his final election speech on sunday			0
so what happens after wednesday ? increasingly , @entity3 feels like a country caught between its past and its future			1
for many , the @entity2 represents the triumph against a heinous apartheid system			2
the memory of @entity4 , so central to that victory , is still fresh			2
leaving this party of freedom , which has enjoyed near 70 % majorities in the late 1990s and early 2000s , feels like a betrayal of the struggle for freedom			0
yet , slowly , all that is changing			0
a 63 % win by the @entity2 , for example , will mean that the party is experiencing its second significant decline in two successive elections			1
with the growing discontent about its government , it is unlikely that it will claw back these losses at the next election in 2019			0
the opposition da , for long regarded as a " white party , " is swiftly transforming			0
advised by @entity61 and @entity215 's former pollster , @entity214 , it has encouraged the emergence of credible young black leaders			0
the @entity27 , in just five months , has become a force to be reckoned with			0
but both parties are only likely to give the @entity2 a real run for its money in the 2019 and 2024 elections			1
many are hoping that the @entity2 will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures			1
among these would be assessing the damage done to the party by @entity38 's scandals , and a return to some regard for the people			1
indeed , speculation is rife that @entity38 may be ousted should the @entity2 's showing in this election fall to 60 %			1
@entity38 controls about 75 % of the @entity2 's national executive committee , and it is unlikely that his allies in that powerful body would cut him loose			1
given that scenario , he will continue to inflict damage on the party of @entity4 -- and on the nation 's fortunes			2
that would open the window for a stronger challenge from the opposition in 2019 and beyond			0
on the other hand , president @entity38 could attempt to introduce serious economic reforms to build a proud legacy for himself			1
that , too , seems unlikely			0
and so @entity3 finds itself caught in a slow , glacial even , journey towards a multi-party future			2
loyalty to its past heroes continues to hold it hostage .			0

@entity3 's fifth democratic elections are held this wednesday - first since @entity4 's death
president @entity38 is most divisive figure in @entity3 politics today , says justice @entity267
@entity267 : several scandals have wracked his administration since he came to power in 2009
