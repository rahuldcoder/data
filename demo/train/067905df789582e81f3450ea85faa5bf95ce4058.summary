thousands of @entity0 celebrated the release sunday night of 550 inmates from @entity4 prisons , part of the second phase of the deal that won the freedom of captured @entity4 soldier @entity9			1
the revelry in the @entity11 in @entity12 -- the long - timehome to the late @entity0 leader @entity13 -- ran late into the night			1
@entity14 , general - secretary in @entity0 president @entity16 ' office , was among those officials greeting the line of freed prisoners , as they all paid their respects at @entity13 's grave			1
@entity23 ' armed wing , the @entity22 , welcomed the news even as they , like @entity14 and other @entity0 leaders , continued to push for the release of others in @entity4 custody			1
" it 's a great accomplishment , but it 's not the end , " brigade spokesman @entity29 said sunday night			0
" we will work toward liberating all our prisoners			0
" the @entity34 said in a news release sunday night that the @entity36 assisted in the release process , which it noted at 10:30 p.m. had been " completed			2
" it all follows a deal , signed between @entity4 and @entity23 in october , that won @entity9 's release from @entity23 in exchange for allowing more than 1,000 @entity0 to leave @entity4 jails			1
a total of 477 prisoners were freed in october under the first stage of the swap			2
phase two happened late sunday night with the departure of ten buses from @entity48 , said @entity49 of the @entity4 @entity50			1
the majority of the prisoners to be released sunday -- 505 , including four women -- were sent to the @entity54 through the @entity56 crossing			1
forty - one others were transferred into @entity58 through the @entity60 crossing			0
two prisoners were sent to @entity62 via the @entity64 crossing and two others -- a man and a woman -- were sent to their homes in east @entity69 via the @entity71 base			0
@entity14 , the senior official in @entity16 ' office , thanked @entity74 officials for their role in the prisoner swap			0
he also said that @entity0 leaders are still seeking the release of others " including the old , children and the ill ones and also the members of the @entity0 legislative council			2
" " we insist that going back to the negotiation table will not happen without the immediate halt of all settlement activities ... and the recognition of the state borders , including @entity69 , and the release of all prisoners as agreed to with the previous @entity4 government , " @entity14 said			1
ahead of the expected release , @entity4 security forces and hundreds of @entity0 clashed at a @entity54 crossing near the internment facility where the prisoners were being held			1
at least 20 palestinians and one @entity4 soldier were injured in the sunday evening skirmishes at the @entity56 crossing , according to @entity0 and @entity4 officials			1
@entity102 , spokesman for the @entity0 medical relief services in @entity12 , told @entity104 that many of the @entity0 suffered injuries from inhaling tear gas and from rubber bullets fired by the @entity4 security forces at the families and friends of the soon - to - be - released prisoners			1
@entity0 independent lawmaker and political activist @entity113 , who was at the scene of the clashes , told @entity104 that he had been sprayed with foul - smelling water used to disperse crowds and had been overcome by tear gas			2
an @entity4 military spokesman said some 400 @entity0 were engaged in an " illegal riot " at the crossing point and were throwing rocks and burning tires			1
the spokesman said soldiers were using riot control methods to disperse the crowds			0
@entity9 was captured in june 2006 , and spent more than five years in captivity			0
while the first stage of the deal to release him provoked significant discontent among some @entity4 , with the families of terror victims claiming the price paid for one single soldier was too costly , sunday 's release prompted very little attention in @entity4 media			1
" the first group of prisoners released in october is immeasurably different from the one to be released today , " @entity140 , head of the paroles department at the @entity4 @entity142 , told @entity104			1
" all 550 freed today were not directly involved in the injuring or killing of @entity4 citizens and most of them are members of @entity150 , " @entity140 said			2
@entity150 , the ruling @entity0 party , is considered in @entity4 as the most moderate of all @entity0 political fractions			2
" the list in the first part of the deal was largely dictated by @entity23 and was composed mainly of prisoners with blood on their hands serving life imprisonments			0
most of them were members of @entity23 and other extremist organizations , " she added			0
many of the inmates who were released sunday would have finished serving their sentences before the end of 2012 , @entity140 said			0
but some criticized the terms of the swap agreement			0
" this deal is a formality that does n't meet our expectations			0
the second stage of this deal did n't include old , ill or handicapped prisoners			0
it also did n't include the remaining five female prisoners inside @entity4 jails			2
this deal was solely controlled by the @entity4 side , " @entity178 , the @entity179 minister of detainees and ex-detainees affairs , told @entity104			0
" we will welcome and celebrate the prisoners in the @entity11 upon their release			0
the fact that the release will take place during the night will not affect our celebrations			0
@entity4 decided to release them at night with the wrong assumption that this will affect the intensity of the celebrations			2
the celebrations will start tonight and will continue for several days in different districts and towns , each prisoner will be celebrated in his own hometown , " @entity178 said			0
the minister said @entity4 had launched a large arrest campaign after the initial prisoner release in october			1
" as long as the occupation continues , arrests will continue , " he said , adding that approximately 3,500 @entity0 prisoners remain behind bars in @entity4 prisons .			1

the release of 550 @entity0 prisoners has been " completed , " @entity4 's military says
thousands of @entity0 welcome the release , celebrating late into the night
clashes break out at @entity54 crossing ahead of the release , 20 injured
the prisoner exchange began in october , with the release of 477 @entity0
