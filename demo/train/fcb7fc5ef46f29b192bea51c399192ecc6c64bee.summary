@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 plans to appeal a federal judge 's dismissal of charges against five @entity9 security guards accused of killing 17 people in @entity0 in 2007 , vice president @entity3 announced saturday			1
speaking at a joint appearance with @entity1 president @entity12 in @entity0 , @entity3 said he was " disappointed " with the ruling , and that the @entity13 would file the appeal next week			1
" the @entity4 is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the @entity1 people , " @entity3 told reporters			1
the september 2007 shootout in @entity0 's @entity21 left 17 @entity1 dead and two dozen wounded			1
the killings led @entity1 's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by @entity9 , now known as @entity9 , and other firms			1
an attorney representing one of the five defendants in the case said he was disappointed by @entity3 's announcement in @entity1 , saying it was motivated by " political purposes " as opposed to legal reasoning			1
" this is not how the @entity13 announces its intentions in any case , " said @entity36 , attorney for @entity37			2
" we had no idea that the vice president was going to announce a political decision			0
" last month , @entity4 district judge @entity48 found that the government 's case was built largely on " statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution , " a violation of the fifth amendment rights of the five men charged			1
" in their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case , the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation , " @entity48 wrote in a 90 - page decision			2
federal prosecutors " repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced , senior prosecutors assigned to the case " in doing so , he found			2
@entity48 also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case , calling their explanations for using the guards ' statements " all too often contradictory , unbelievable and lacking in credibility			2
" " in short , the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants ' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , " he wrote			0
@entity36 , @entity37 's attorney , said @entity48 's " reasoning is sound and will hold up in appeal			0
" the men were guarding a @entity90 convoy moving through western @entity0 when the shooting began			0
the company said its contractors came under attack , but @entity1 authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate			1
each of the now - former guards -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity37 , @entity101 and @entity102 -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter , 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime			0
prosecutors requested that charges against @entity102 be dropped in november , but thursday 's ruling dismisses the counts against all five			0
" we 're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them , " @entity99 's lawyer , @entity114 , said at the time of the dismissal			0
a sixth guard , @entity122 , pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter			0
@entity2 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
