the new biblical epic from director @entity2 , " @entity3 : @entity5 and @entity6 , " has a race problem			1
we 've known since the moment the full cast was announced : nearly every major role in the movie is played by a white actor			1
what makes it worse for many observers is that , on the flip side , virtually every black actor in the movie is playing a part called " @entity20 thief " or " assassin " or " royal servant " or " @entity20 lower class civilian			2
" in the weeks before " @entity3 " opens , on december 12 , a number of people , from @entity27 activists to @entity29 journalists , have called for a boycott of the potential blockbuster			1
" as much as i love a good @entity35 movie , i 'm going to go ahead and boycott this one , " wrote @entity32 in the @entity33			2
" and i invite my fellow @entity29 to join me			0
" if " @entity3 " were a tale set in the @entity39 , such a disparity might be historically justifiable			1
but this story is set in @entity20 ( which was part of @entity42 even back then ) , with characters of exclusively @entity45 origin			0
according to the @entity35 , @entity46 , and therefore all subsequent @entity29 , were of @entity47 -- that is , @entity48 -- descent			0
before we start skewering @entity2 too thoroughly , we should probably remember that the whitewashing of @entity35 movies is a well - established tradition			0
@entity54 's " @entity58 " should probably get a pass , as it was made in 1956 , before @entity56 was integrated to any substantial degree			0
but the same can not be said for this past spring 's " @entity60 , " which has an even less diverse cast than " @entity3 , " and with greater racial implications , seeing as how all of humanity is supposed to have descended from @entity60 and his entirely white family			1
nor should we pretend that this is a modern problem , or one unique to film representations of the @entity35 and its central characters			2
every @entity70 painting of a biblical scene , from the @entity72 through the @entity73 and beyond , depicts a whitewashed @entity35			0
@entity2 has attributed the casting of his film to pure marketing concerns : " i ca n't mount a film of this budget , where i have to rely on tax rebates in @entity80 , and say that my lead actor is @entity82 so - and - so from such - and - such			2
i 'm just not going to get it financed			0
so the question does n't even come up			2
" this is a rationale very much of our time -- including the thinly veiled racism of " @entity82 so - and - so " -- but it fails to account for the long history of the bleached - out @entity35 , in which @entity2 's movie simply makes up the most recent chapter			2
the most obvious error in this sort of casting is the historical one : inhabitants of @entity20 and @entity97 simply did n't look like @entity98 or @entity99			2
the deeper problem is one of conflating whiteness with heroism and power			2
is it so hard to imagine our biblical heroes as being nonwhite ? is it beyond belief that one of the greatest empires in world history had authentically dark skin , rather than being white folks just wearing a ton of makeup ? does @entity117 have a prayer in @entity56 ? when it comes to the depiction of the @entity122 in " @entity3 " in particular , however , there is a more specific issue at play			1
@entity126 ceo @entity125 , not known as an expert on race or history , weighed in with the rhetorical question ( which he then proceeded to answer ) : " since when are @entity122 not white ? all i know are			1
" the race of the ancient @entity122 has been controversial for over two centuries			1
it is a loaded debate that can not be understood apart from the historical contexts of the scholars engaged in the conversation			0
the debate was particularly intense during the abolitionist movement in the @entity139			0
at stake were the claims of the pro-slavery faction : that black people were inherently physically and intellectually inferior and , thus , well - suited for slavery			0
if the ancient @entity122 -- world leaders in architecture , engineering , farming , and literary production , as well as documented slave owners -- were not white , then there was a problem			1
this project reached its apex in the work of " @entity155 " of anthropology , founded in the first half of the 19th century by @entity158 , which claimed that @entity117 had created multiple hierarchically organized races , with @entity161 at the top			0
this idea was taken one step further by @entity166 slave owner @entity165 , who repeatedly stated " that the @entity20 race were @entity161			1
" @entity165 ominously attributed the inability of @entity122 to recapture power in the @entity170 to their mixing with other races			1
the clear agenda here was to provide a historical basis for @entity27 slavery			1
from the second half of the 20th century onward , anthropologists have largely agreed that ancient @entity122 were indigenous to the @entity180 region and genetically representative of @entity42			1
@entity20 has long been a genetic crossroads , because it has long been a political and economic crossroads , since before we have written records			0
at least one important minority opinion , however , known as " the black @entity20 hypothesis , " emphasizes racial ties between @entity20 and @entity189			0
the theory -- favored by @entity195 -- draws upon philology , the writings of historians , and art and architecture to argue that ancient @entity20 was a black civilization			1
how @entity198 flipped the script in @entity56 this controversy over race is something the makers of " @entity3 " claim to have thought about			1
" we cast major actors from different ethnicities to reflect this diversity of culture , from @entity210 to @entity80 to @entity211 , " @entity2 said			0
" there are many different theories about the ethnicity of the @entity20 people , and we had a lot of discussions about how to best represent the culture			0
" despite this discussion , the tableau produced in " @entity3 , " unfortunately , is the one favored by 19th - century slave traders			1
in an important sense , however , the entire debate , down to the present , is essentially moot			0
the categories of modern @entity139 were not relevant to the concerns of ancient @entity122			1
modern anthropologists no longer see race as a fundamental biological or natural category of people , but rather as a biocultural category , intermingling genetic and anatomical data with economic , political , and social data			2
historically , skin tone was not the key feature by which society was hierarchically structured			0
race is a lived experience , of course , but the distinction between slave and free -- a critical one in the ancient world -- was not drawn along modern racial lines			1
there were more than a few blond - haired , pale - skinned " barbarian " slaves in the roman empire			0
in the ancient world it was more important to be free than pale			2
still , the image of ancient @entity122 as white has been powerful and destructive			1
whitewashing the @entity35 is problematic both because it is unhistorical and because it reinscribes the dangerous association of whiteness , divine favor and heroism that has plagued modern @entity257			0
recognizing the violent and painful history of this idea -- particularly as it pertains to ancient @entity20 -- is an important preamble to talking about it .			0

critics say the new movie " @entity3 " has a " race problem "
the race of the ancient @entity122 has been controversial for more than 200 years
@entity27 slave owners *insisted* @entity122 were white ; historians are n't so sure
