-- all the tech world 's eyes will be on @entity3 monday , when the computing giant 's 24th annual @entity4 kicks off in @entity6			1
as its name suggests , the weeklong gathering lets @entity3 host presentations and workshops for the people who make a living writing the apps and other software that run on its products			1
but its opening keynote almost always makes news			2
the conference has been the launching pad for two phones ( the @entity23 in 2009 and the @entity24 in 2010 ) and several new , or updated , @entity25			0
this year , the former seems highly unlikely			0
the latter ? maybe not so much			0
fans are clamoring for some excitement , because @entity3 has n't introduced a major new product since the @entity31 last october			1
and with growing competition from such rivals as @entity35 and @entity36 , there 's always the chance that the secretive folks from @entity39 are cooking up something big			2
so here 's a look at what to expect from @entity4			1
@entity3 's keynote begins monday at 1 p.m. et. a new @entity45 the safest bet for @entity4 is that @entity3 will introduce @entity45 7 to the world			1
for the first time , @entity3 vice president @entity48 is responsible for the update , and reports have suggested the mobile operating system will be " black , white and flat all over			1
" unnamed @entity3 sources have popped up on the @entity54 , saying that much of the color , gloss and shine will be removed from the look of @entity24 , @entity31 and @entity60 screens in favor of a simpler black - and - white theme			1
style aside , there will almost certainly be a host of new features to announce as well			0
reports have centered on improved in - car support for @entity69 and @entity70 , along with new integration for third - party ( and @entity73 - owned ) apps like video site @entity74 and photo site @entity76			0
the update also could bring @entity78 , which allows easy @entity80 sharing between @entity3 devices , to mobile			1
new @entity83 the @entity85 and @entity86 laptops are both due to be updated , according to @entity3 's once - a - year pattern			1
and the timing is right : @entity89 just announced a more powerful processing chip			0
it will be a challenge for @entity3 to shrink the already ultra-slim @entity86 much further			1
but if the rumors are true , the beefier @entity92 may give way to a new , sleeker version of itself			0
@entity3 also could introduce a refreshed @entity97 desktop tower for those deep - pocketed office managers who prefer to order the freshest machines			1
a streaming - music service ? it seems like only a matter of time before @entity3 leaps into the increasingly crowded streaming - music market led by @entity104 , @entity105 and others			1
@entity3 's been making deals with record labels such as @entity109 and @entity110 , which would allow them to stream songs to users as part of a free or paid - subscription service			1
observers expect such a platform , possibly called @entity117 , would exist apart from @entity118 , @entity3 's digital - media service , and focus on mobile devices			1
@entity120 sure , there are realistic expectations			0
then there are the really fun ones			0
@entity125 springs eternal in the fanboy 's breast , so we wo n't be the ones to shoot down hopes for a big , " one more thing " surprise			2
and , hey -- ceo @entity132 has already teased " exciting new product categories " this year			0
according to observers , an @entity135 set has been on the verge of being released for years now			1
( experts are just sure the company is going to roll out a tv set			2
) a little over a year ago , there was a bizarrely specific @entity143 survey asking loyal customers about the " concept " of an @entity135			2
it seems like too much of a real thing to never happen			0
but will it happen next week ? not likely			0
joining the mythical " @entity135 " is an @entity3 watch -- another product everybody is sure is coming , despite @entity3 having said no such thing			1
wearable tech is becoming a huge field and @entity3 would surely like to cool off some of the heat generated lately by @entity155			2
a watch feels slightly more likely than a tv , but not by much			0
this fall , just in time for holiday shopping , seems a more likely release date for one or both			0
and , quite possibly , for a new @entity24			0
there have been some rumblings about a possible new @entity31			0
it has been a little more than seven months since the @entity31 was unveiled , though , and only four months since @entity3 offered a @entity166 version of its bigger counterpart			2
so a new model would be a surprise			0
what do you want to see from @entity3 ? let us know in the comments .			2

observers expect a new mobile operating system and refreshed @entity83
a rumored smart watch and a possible @entity135 set remain *longshots* for now
