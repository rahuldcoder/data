-- just three weeks after @entity1 and @entity2 announced their separation , there is speculation of a new plus - one in the mix for " @entity1			1
" @entity8 , here with his sons , was photographed on vacation with another woman			1
fans of the show are buzzing about photos of @entity8 apparently on vacation in @entity17 , @entity18 , with a young woman who is definitely not his wife and reality tv co-star			1
@entity23 identified her as @entity24 , the daughter of dr. @entity25 , a surgeon who famously performed a tummy tuck on @entity2 that was documented for the @entity29 ' hit @entity28 show			0
@entity8 and @entity25 appeared to be the guests of designer @entity31 , creator of the @entity33 line , and the pair was spotted holding hands , smoking together and lounging aboard @entity31 's yacht			1
the @entity29 ' marriage became the focus of their reality show -- which had followed the adventures of the pair raising a set of twins and sextuplets -- amid allegations that @entity1 was cheating on @entity2 with 23 - year - old teacher @entity46			2
@entity1 repeatedly denied that he had strayed			0
but after much speculation and tension on the show , the couple announced in june that they had separated			1
the same day , @entity2 filed for divorce			0
given the media spotlight , dating coach @entity54 said , it 's not a good idea for @entity8 to be out with another woman so soon after the marital rift			1
" you need to take a little time off from dating , because there is this rebound period , " @entity54 said			1
" he 's probably feeling that he was n't getting enough attention from his wife , so he 's all lonely , and he needs to be stroked up			0
" once he gets the feeling that ' i 'm loveable ; i 'm worthy ; someone loves me for me and wants to put me first , ' " @entity54 theorized , " then that person he is dating , either he will dump her , or she will dump him			2
" relationship expert @entity70 said the unfortunate ones in the high - profile tabloid fodder are the @entity8 children : 8 - year - old twins @entity74 and @entity76 and 5 - year - old sextuplets @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
" their whole tv show is based on them being parents and caring for all of these kids they have , and both of them seem totally wrapped up in themselves , " @entity70 said			0
" it 's strange that [ @entity1 ] feels like he has to deny the whole thing , then at the same time he is flaunting it			2
" @entity95 @entity94 advises that parents should wait about a year after a separation before introducing a relationship to their children			0
" children need about a year at least to adjust to the new sense of family and to develop individual relationships with each parent , " said @entity94 , the author of " @entity105 with @entity106 the @entity107			0
" " when @entity109 has a girlfriend , then kids can see that as an intrusion on their time and their situation			1
" @entity94 , whose @entity107 program for children of divorce is mandatory through the court system in several states , said children go through a great deal of emotional turmoil in the wake of a broken marriage			0
couples should wait at least six months to even let their kids know that they are actively dating , @entity94 said			2
" it is hurtful to children to think that their parents are dating when it is done so soon after a separation , " @entity94 said			2
" because what it says is that it is minimizing the marriage , and the marriage is crucial to children because they came from this union , and they want to know that their parents were in love when [ the children ] were born			0
" the idea that there could be such a quick move to dating that the children are aware of could devalue their parents ' relationship and therefore themselves			2
" @entity94 noted that parents going through a divorce can date privately but said they should also consider counseling before entering another serious relationship to guard against the high divorce rate for second marriages			0
@entity8 has n't commented on the seriousness of his apparent relationship or even confirmed that it is a relationship			1
he told @entity157 that he felt " very relaxed " during his time away , though he added : " i keep thinking about the kids and missing them			0
