-- @entity2 's managers have complied with the wishes of most of the state attorneys general who demanded they rid the site of prostitution ads. @entity2 says it has removed prostitution ads , but some issues remain			1
the @entity10 's dominate classifieds publication replaced its controversial " erotic " section with a new " adult " category			0
and where @entity2 once relied on readers to flag dodgy advertisements , the company 's employees now review every ad submitted to the adult area before they appear online			1
yet , the site has been unable to block every solicitation for sex			1
@entity24 , a self - described sex worker from @entity25 , confirmed for @entity0 that she successfully posted an ad for her services to the adult section late last week			1
she wished to remain anonymous , so neither the ad 's photo nor text can be included in this story			1
regardless , it is n't hard to find questionable ads in @entity2 's new adult section			1
the most noticeable difference between @entity2 's erotic and adult categories is the photos			1
in the adult section , the photos are less provocative			0
when it comes to the text , however , the two sections are very similar			0
both are packed with ads for massage services			0
ads in both areas include descriptions of the masseuse 's breast size ( " i 'm a natural c cup " ) and they are often photographed dressed in their underwear			0
even if most of these services are legitimate , and only a few are veiled offers of sex in the new adult area , plenty of others make little if any pretense about what they offer			0
these ads typically include words such as " busty , " or " fantasy girl " in their descriptions			0
often , they feature photos of a woman or man dressed provocatively in their underwear or bathing suit			0
clearly , @entity2 faces a significant challenge as it tries to purge prostitution from its web pages			1
while it can ban nude photos and overt offers of sex , how can anyone expect the site to outlaw ads featuring photos of bikini - clad women offering phone numbers ? one can find racier images in department store ads. the @entity95 has made it easier for merchants of all kinds to conduct commerce and reach wider audiences			1
should anyone be surprised that the sex trade has benefited from this as well			0
if @entity2 were to disappear tomorrow , does anyone really expect that would curb prostitution ? a review of some competing online classifieds shows that while @entity2 has been a popular destination for sex workers , it is by no means the only one			1
for example , @entity111 is an online classified publication and @entity2 competitor			2
the content it produces can also be found on the web sites of some entertainment and alternative publications in major metropolitan areas , such as @entity122 's @entity121 or @entity25 's @entity123			2
@entity2 is g - rated compared with the photos found in @entity126 ' adult section			1
ads included nude photos while others showed people engaged in sexual intercourse			0
a common ad would show a bare chested woman asking men to call her at a phone number			1
in the area of @entity137 that services @entity138 , @entity139 , one ad found on tuesday by @entity0 featured a photo of a bare - chested woman apparently engaged in masturbation			1
it must be noted that there was nothing as graphic on @entity2			2
this is relevant because @entity148 , @entity139 's attorney general , last week threatened @entity2 with a criminal investigation			2
@entity148 has n't made any similar threats -- at least none that has been publicized -- against @entity126			0
managers at @entity126 did not respond to an interview request			0
in november , @entity2 and 40 state attorneys general , including @entity148 , signed an agreement that called for the site to add more safeguards			1
the classifieds publication followed through and one of the new changes was a new requirement that anyone posting to the erotic section must provide a credit card			0
all the parties hoped that criminals would be unwilling to provide identification and this would be deterrent			0
" many of the classified and communication services on the @entity2 site provide the public with a valuable service , " @entity148 wrote to @entity2 ceo @entity169 on may 5			1
" however , it appears that the management ... has knowingly allowed the site to be used for illegal and unlawful activity after warnings from law enforcement officials and after an agreement with forty state attorneys general			2
" since then , @entity2 did away with the erotic section and agreed to review every ad before it appeared , but @entity148 was dissatisfied			1
he posted a note on his site that said the " @entity187 site continues to display advertisements for prostitution and graphic pornographic material			0
this content was not removed as we requested			0
we have no alternative but to move forward with criminal investigation and potential prosecution			0
" this is at best an empty threat , says @entity198 , a senior staff attorney for the @entity199			0
the @entity200 protects web sites like @entity2 from being held criminally liable for the actions of its users , @entity198 said , who added that @entity2 has no legal obligation to even review ads before they go online			1
had @entity198 had his way , @entity2 would have never agreed to do the monitoring			2
@entity209 , @entity2 's founder , had earlier gone on national tv and said that @entity2 would not do away with the erotic section			2
the company 's reversal may have led @entity148 to believe he could shame @entity2 managers into doing more than what the law required			1
" it made life more difficult for @entity2 i think , " @entity198 said			2
" but i was much more disappointed with ( @entity148 ) than @entity2 , " @entity198 said			2
" his threats were bogus to begin with and he was wrong to threaten ( @entity2 's managers ) with jail when the law is very clearly on their side			1
