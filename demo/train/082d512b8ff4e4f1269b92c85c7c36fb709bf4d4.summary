-- for many , back - to - school is a season of anticipation , nostalgia , and shopping			1
for me , it evokes memories of an unsung historical event : the integration of @entity11			1
no , i 'm not talking about racial integration ; i 'm talking about the full inclusion of students with disabilities			1
when i entered @entity17 as a freshman in 1980 , it happened to coincide with a new requirement -- all institutions receiving federal funds had to become fully accessible under @entity22			1
i was a 17 - year - old lifelong wheelchair - user , born with a neurological condition called spinal muscular atrophy			1
i 'd never walked or stood and my arms were weak as a baby 's			1
but , as my parents often said , there was nothing wrong with my head			1
i had little awareness of the precedent i was setting			1
at 17 , i was too self - centered for that			1
i was preoccupied with how i 'd cope my first time living away from my parents , depending on full - time , live - in personal - care attendants			1
yet i had an @entity40 freshman 's cockiness , too			1
i 'd always managed before , had n't i ? to be sure , @entity11 had had students with disabilities before me			1
but those students had to make do , bearing or circumventing access barriers without complaint			1
after all , it was a centuries - old campus			1
how much could one expect ? @entity48 , on the other hand , had rights -- and expectations			1
i challenged the university in a whole new way			2
i was an inadvertent pioneer			2
i mean , it was n't my fault			2
i had n't fought for my rights			2
they fell into my lap. the timing was a coincidence , one i was n't entirely comfortable with			2
i remember meeting with university officials the summer before my freshman year got under way			2
we discussed every detail of my life and needs			2
what was the width my widest wheelchair ? did i take baths or showers ? how much space around a toilet did i require for transfers ? boxers or briefs ? ( just kidding			1
) i also had to pre-pick classes so @entity11 could ensure mine would be held in accessible classrooms , of which there were too few			1
if i changed my mind , i could be out of luck			2
not that pioneering was an unfamiliar role for me			2
i 'd been the first and only " handicapped " student in my nursery , elementary and high schools , too			2
my parents had insisted on my attending " regular " schools at a time when that was unheard of			0
in the 1960s , according to government statistics , only one in five disabled kids was educated in a public school -- usually a separate ( dare i say " segregated " ? ) special - ed school			0
the majority stayed home or got sent off to under - regulated residential institutions			0
more than a million handicapped kids had no access to the school system at all			0
many states even had statutes specifically excluding the deaf , blind or mentally retarded from public schooling ! we lived in @entity105 , and my parents were private - school kind of people			0
i vaguely recall how the schools my older , non-disabled brother attended refused to accept me , how my parents had to argue and beg on my behalf			0
they knew separate was n't equal , but they had no legal recourse			0
i ended up at the only private schools willing to take a kid in a wheelchair			1
it 's no exaggeration to say that for many years i assumed i was simply too dumb for my parents ' first - choice schools			0
today , of course , it 's completely different			0
after countless pieces of legislation , reauthorizations , government commissions and legal rulings , wheelchair ramps and lifts , @entity127 and recorded books , sign - language interpreters , " shadow teachers , " and other accommodations are commonplace in schools as they are elsewhere			1
parents of so - called special - needs kids still have to fight sometimes to ensure fairness , but they have rights and a grievance process on their side			0
integration is the standard that must be met			0
ultimately , my @entity11 experience had its ups and downs , as might be expected of what was a revolutionary new concept			1
sadly , it was n't just the ancient brick buildings and cobblestone paths that posed inexorable barriers ; sometimes hidebound traditions can be equally obdurate			0
nevertheless , how the demographics of education has changed became especially clear to me recently when my kids ' school held a " diversity day			0
" ( my kids do n't have disabilities , but some of their classmates do			0
) i boldly volunteered to lead a discussion about people with disabilities			0
to my surprise , i was n't the only one			0
kids do n't always appreciate this			0
for them , the return to the school year is a ritualized obligation			0
what a shame so few understand it as a right and a privilege to be celebrated -- a proud and hard - won victory			0
overcoming barriers to bring mobility to the world			0
