@entity0 -- @entity2 approved a $ 9.7 billion @entity4 aid package on friday following delays over fiscal cliff bickering , warnings of dwindling federal funds and swirling controversy over millions of dollars for unrelated projects			1
the measure passed the @entity12 , 354 - 67			1
the @entity13 did so unanimously and without debate			2
it was the first legislative action of the new @entity2 , which picked up the @entity4 package after the previous session on tuesday shelved a vote on a much larger assistance plan for storm victims , infuriating @entity22 and @entity23 politicians			1
lawmakers from both houses will weigh in on $ 51 billion in additional @entity4 aid on january 15			2
but that larger portion will likely face much closer scrutiny in a @entity2 anticipating more acrimony over spending and debt in coming months			1
@entity12 leaders initially balked at immediate consideration of a big spending bill just after concluding the excruciating negotiations around the fiscal cliff			1
house speaker @entity37 preferred to wait a few days at least before holding a vote on a @entity4 bill			1
the original storm legislation also included what some @entity41 saw as congressional " pork , " or money for unrelated pet projects			2
budget hawks viewed the extra funding as wasteful in an era of record deficits			1
some lawmakers and taxpayer interest groups teased out $ 8 million for cars for the @entity54 and justice departments , $ 2 million for the @entity55 to repair roofs , $ 150 million for fisheries , and $ 100 million for repair of @entity60 facilities			0
" it 's perceived to be free money			0
it goes around the budget caps that are ever tightening			0
traditionally we have n't offset disaster funding , but that does n't mean that some of these things should be in there , " said @entity65 , vice president for @entity66 , a nonpartisan budget watchdog			0
" it 's honey for the flies			0
" but @entity22 @entity77 rep. @entity77 rejected criticisms of pet projects , or earmarks			0
" those reports were totally false , " @entity77 said on @entity1			0
the @entity82 said the broader aid package was designed to provide funding for any federally declared disaster last year , not just @entity4			2
conservative groups , such as the @entity87 , urged @entity12 members to oppose friday 's scaled - back bill that included more than $ 9 billion to help the government pay flood insurance claims			1
@entity2 faced strong pressure to boost the debt - ridden flood insurance program , which is the primary option for that type of coverage for @entity97 homeowners and businesses			1
it has been under severe financial pressure for years from payouts related to big storms like @entity102 in 2005			0
the @entity103 told @entity2 on tuesday the flood insurance program was nearly out of money to compensate storm victims and required new authority to borrow more money to meet its obligations			1
" @entity2 should not allow the federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the first place , let alone expand the national flood insurance program 's authority , " the @entity87 wrote on its website			1
@entity116 @entity115 rep. @entity115 said flood insurance claims needed to be met for victims who paid their premiums			2
" but madam speaker , here is the tragic reality -- the national flood insurance program is broke			1
it is now taxpayer bailout broke , " he said on the @entity12 floor			2
rep. @entity77 blasts his own party @entity132 and @entity41 lawmakers in the storm - struck region , including @entity23 gov. @entity135 , unleashed a firestorm of criticism at @entity138 for not addressing the measure as originally planned on tuesday			0
" @entity23 deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display , " @entity135 said , adding , that this is " why the @entity97 people hate @entity2			2
" @entity41 civil war over @entity4 relief later , closed - door meetings between @entity12 @entity41 from the @entity148 and @entity37 and majority leader @entity149 got the aid package back on track with friday 's vote on flood insurance and a promise to address the rest in coming weeks			1
but @entity65 said that tempers may flare anew when @entity2 debates the next portion , including the question of unrelated storm expenses			0
" we have to do the scrutiny			0
it wo n't be pretty			0
there 'll be some hurt feelings , " he said			0
opinion : @entity41 's obstructionism is suicide strategy @entity1 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity13 approves bill following @entity12 passage
extra funding in original @entity4 bill included money for fisheries
@entity2 will consider more help for @entity4 victims later this month
@entity4 victims need help from debt - ridden government insurance program
