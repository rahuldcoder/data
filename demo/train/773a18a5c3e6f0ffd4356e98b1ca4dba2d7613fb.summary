-- in 1916 , @entity3 polar explorer @entity1 managed to save his entire crew after they had been stranded in the @entity6 for almost two years			1
now , nearly a century later , @entity9 explorer @entity7 and his team of five adventurers have set sail thursday on a voyage to emulate @entity1 's epic survival journey , using almost exactly the same equipment and rations			1
during the original , grandly titled " @entity17 " , @entity1 had attempted to cross the @entity6 and reach the @entity19 with a crew of 27 men on his ship , the @entity23			2
but , after little more than a month , temperatures dropped so dramatically that the ship froze solid in the ice and eventually sunk			0
so began the long mission to survive , culminating in what is regarded by many to be one of the most astonishing rescue journeys in history			0
after abandoning ship and finding land on the inhospitable and remote @entity35 , @entity1 set out with just five of his men in a small open lifeboat to seek help for the rest of his crew			1
braving 20 meter - high waves , they rowed for two weeks across 800 nautical miles ( 1,482 kilometers ) of icy ocean to the island of @entity46			0
there they trekked 32 miles along the island 's mountainous interior , eventually securing vital assistance at a manned whaling outpost			0
attempts to repeat @entity1 's rescue mission have been done before , but @entity7 ' journey has a special twist			1
in the name of authenticity , they will reenact the whole thing on a replica of the original lifeboat and use only equipment and rations available in the early 20th century			1
" nobody has managed to do it the way @entity1 did it -- with the same gear and the same boat , " said @entity7 , who believes it 's the most challenging expedition of his life			1
" it 's not to be taken lightly , " he added			0
the only modern adjustments on board are the emergency gear and radios			0
apart from that , the crew are facing exactly the same privations as their predecessors -- right down to the handmade reindeer skin sleeping bags , unpalatable but nutritious @entity83 ( a concentrated mixture of fat and protein ) and @entity1 's favorite whiskey " @entity88 "			1
@entity7 and his crew have just left @entity35 and are now sailing the rough @entity90 in their replica of the @entity93 , a wooden lifeboat only 6.85 meters ( 22 feet ) long ; the size of a typical six - seated mini bus			2
they will then attempt the climb using only one small section of rope and a carpenter 's adze -- just as @entity1 did			1
as the centenary of @entity1 's journey approaches , the motivation for this expedition is in large part to honor the great explorer 's legacy , even if it means risking life and limb and overcoming some enormous challenges			1
" there is a certain amount of luck involved , as well as the skill of the crew and the preparation of the boat , " explained @entity7 , in an interview before he left for the @entity6			2
the team 's skipper @entity121 is concerned about the technical difficulties of operating an antiquated yacht			2
" the boat does n't have a keel , which means it will capsize easily			0
and since we are relying on celestial navigation , a cloudy sky will make it more difficult knowing where we are , " he said			0
for the worst case scenario , there is a modern boat trailing them , ready to pick them up if disaster strikes			0
and , unlike @entity1 and his men , this crew has n't already spent over 500 days abandoned in the @entity6			2
polar historian and author dr @entity141 thinks this reenactment is an excellent way of resussitating interested in the early 20th century period known as the " @entity145 "			1
" we need people like @entity7 to do things like this that bring history alive , " @entity141 said			0
" anyone who has ever been to the @entity90 knows how awesome @entity1 's journey was			1
it 's quite rightly called an epic , " he added			0
" the human will to survive is strong and in @entity1 it found its perfect exponent			0
the man was a legend , " @entity141 said			0
as an environmental scientist , @entity7 also wants to draw attention to the climate change affecting @entity6 since @entity1 's time , which he attributes to global warming			1
most of all , however , he wishes to honor the spirit of @entity1 's philosophy			1
" one of his key messages was the importance of team work , " @entity7 said			2
" we need to all act together in this world today , to overcome our problems			0

adventurers set to *re-enact* polar explorer @entity1 's epic journey .
