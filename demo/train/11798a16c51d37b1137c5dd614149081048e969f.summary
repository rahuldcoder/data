@entity0 -- thursday 's coordinated attack on @entity4 soldiers and civilians , the deadliest in more than two years , spawned reprisal , rhetoric and questions over security in neighboring @entity10			1
@entity4 's military said it launched an airstrike against militants in @entity19 on thursday , hours after a string of bold attacks on buses , civilian vehicles and soldiers left seven @entity4 dead in the southern part of the country			1
@entity23 medical officials said an airstrike north of @entity25 killed a boy in a home and injured five early friday			0
three other people were injured , they said , in a strike on a @entity31 government compound south of the city			0
@entity4 police said an eighth @entity4 , a special operations officer , was killed late thursday in fighting with @entity36 border infiltrators			1
" we all witnessed today an attempt to escalate the terrorist war against @entity4 by launching of attacks from the @entity36 , " prime minister @entity37 said			1
" if there is someone who thinks that the state of @entity4 will let this pass , he is mistaken			2
" the @entity46 in @entity19 , whose leaders were targeted in the airstrike , and @entity31 denied involvement in the terror attacks on @entity4 , with the latter claiming @entity4 was looking for a pretext to attack @entity19			1
the first retaliatory @entity4 airstrike occurred just west of @entity57 , close to the @entity10 border , and killed six people , @entity23 medical and security sources said			1
the victims were five @entity46 members and the son of one of the members			0
@entity64 , head of the group in @entity19 ; @entity67 , head of its military wing ; and @entity71 , a senior operative , were among those targeted , the @entity66 said			0
" @entity66 's blows are now hitting the heads of the committees in @entity19 , " @entity4 defense minister @entity73 said			2
" the people who gave the order to murder our citizens and that were hiding in @entity19 are no longer alive , " @entity37 said			1
late thursday , the @entity66 said forces intercepted a rocket fired on @entity4 from @entity19			2
hours earlier , six civilians and one @entity4 soldier were killed and 40 people were wounded in attacks about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) from the @entity4 city of @entity89 , close to the @entity4 - @entity10 border			1
@entity4 soldiers exchanged gunfire with the assailants and killed seven militants , the military said			1
@entity46 militants attacked with the intention of kidnapping an @entity4 civilian or soldier , the @entity66 said			2
@entity4 believes that the attacks had their roots in @entity19 but were coming out of the neighboring @entity10 region of @entity36			1
they come amid what @entity73 says is " the weakening of @entity10 control over @entity36			2
" @entity10 claims it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the @entity36 , exchanging fire with militants on its side of the border			1
@entity114 , the governor of @entity36 , an @entity10 province , said " the security at border has not been affected by the revolution , and no one from @entity10 has crossed through to conduct the attacks on @entity4			1
" " the distance between the place of the attack and the border of @entity10 is too far to allow the sort of attack conducted on the @entity4 today with the weapons used , " @entity114 added			1
senior @entity10 military and security officials told @entity1 that two members of the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) and one military officer were killed in clashes near the southern border between @entity4 and @entity10			1
gen. @entity134 , head of security in @entity136 , said an @entity4 helicopter was in action over the area , chasing militants in the aftermath of the attacks on @entity4			1
" the @entity4 ground troops engaged with armed militants 200 meters from the @entity10 border which may have also led to casualties on the @entity10 side , " said @entity10 army spokesman lt. col. @entity143			1
" we have reinforced our border guards and raised the level of alert			0
" the incident allegedly occurred east of @entity153 , about 13 kilometers north of @entity154			0
an @entity4 army spokesperson told @entity1 in @entity0 the @entity66 had no information on the @entity10 claims			1
@entity31 denied responsibility for the earlier strikes against @entity4 and condemned " the crime in @entity57			2
" @entity165 , a @entity31 spokesman , said the @entity169 " announced a state of emergency and told the people to be careful and take all the measures needed , hospitals are on high alert , and concentrations of security forces were evacuated			2
" @entity170 , the spokesman for the @entity46 , said the group would have announced its involvement if it were responsible			0
" we warned @entity4 not to blame us just because it is easy for them to do so , " he said			2
" all the options are open now for reaction , from kidnapping soldiers , to suicide attacks inside @entity4 and to shelling with rockets			2
" @entity4 had been on heightened alert in the south of the country , and an elite counter-terrorism unit was in the area , according to an @entity4 government source who does n't want to be identified because he can not speak publicly about the matter			2
the counter-terrorism unit and @entity4 soldiers responded to the attacks , the source said			0
the incident began when shots were fired at a civilian bus traveling from @entity195 to @entity89 , near the community of @entity197			0
attackers also fired shots at another bus and two civilian vehicles			0
@entity89 is a resort town on @entity4 's southern tip , near @entity10 's @entity36 border			1
officials say it 's likely there were both civilians and active - duty soldiers traveling by bus in the area because it was the start of the weekend and soldiers might have been going on breaks to the @entity89 area			0
later , @entity66 soldiers were injured when an explosive device was detonated as they arrived on the scene			0
several mortar shells " were simultaneously fired from the @entity19 at soldiers conducting routine maintenance work on the security fence on the @entity4 - @entity10 border			1
" that was a bit farther north along the border from the bus attack , the @entity66 said			0
" this is a malicious attack on innocent civilians , who were on their way to the known tourist destination city , @entity89 , for their summer vacation , " the @entity66 said			0
" the @entity66 will pursue those responsible for this attack at all costs and will not allow any further harm to @entity4 civilians			1
" @entity73 said @entity4 " will not always be able to prevent such attacks			0
" " the @entity10 control over @entity36 is weakening , and this is probably the reason that this attack that originated in @entity19 has made it all the way down here			1
" " in light of what 's happening near @entity89 , our deepest condolences go out to the victims , their families and loved ones , of what appears to be a brutal and cowardly act of terrorism in southern @entity4 , " the @entity244 @entity243 in @entity245 said			0
@entity89 generally has not endured the kind of strife faced by other regions including the swath of southern @entity4 near @entity19 , the coastal @entity23 territory just south of the jewish state along its west coast			0
across the border , the @entity10 army and police are cracking down in an " anti-terror " operation in the @entity36 area of @entity10 , state - owned media reported tuesday , as reports emerged of @entity270 's doctor surfacing in the area			1
police said they found hand grenades , machine guns , rocket - propelled grenades and ammunition in the operation that targets @entity36 " terror cells " suspected in attacks on a gas pipeline to @entity4 and a police station in the border town of @entity281			2
since the overthrow of the @entity285 regime , the security situation in @entity36 has dramatically deteriorated			0
senior @entity10 officials said several weeks ago that more than 23,000 prisoners escaped from prisons in @entity10 in late january and february because of the breakdown in regime authority			0
about one - third of the escapees have been recaptured , but many apparently traveled to the @entity36 to take advantage of the relative absence of state security			0
many of the weapons looted from police stations ransacked during the revolution ended up in the @entity36			0
travel between @entity10 and @entity19 has become much easier since the @entity301 reopened the border crossing at @entity57 in late may			2
but along with traders -- and @entity305 just wanting a break from their cramped sliver of territory -- there are signs that @entity311 groups have begun taking advantage of weaker security			0
the crossing is the only land passage out of @entity19 not directly under @entity4 control			0
questions are being raised about the @entity10 military presence in the demilitarized zone in @entity36 , which was created under the terms of the @entity321 signed in 1978 between @entity10 and @entity4			1
@entity1 's @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 and journalist @entity327 contributed to this report .			0
