@entity0 -- the harshest critics labeled them " virtual strip searches			0
" @entity6 passenger screening that produced particularly realistic full - body images using backscatter technology			1
others also expressed health concerns about low doses of radiation from the x-rays underpinning those scans			2
well , it 's all over now as the @entity16 says it has met a june 1 deadline to remove all 250 backscatter machines from @entity20 airports			1
travelers will still go through other full - body scans that rely on a system that uses radio waves and produces less detailed body imaging			1
the millimeter wave machines raise fewer privacy and virtually no health concerns			1
" i think from the privacy perspective , that ( the elimination of backscatter machines ) has to be considered a victory , " said @entity29 of the @entity30			0
the @entity16 maintained that the backscatter machines , manufactured by @entity36 , were safe and effective			2
the agency had developed protocols to assure that screeners who saw imagery of passengers never saw the passengers themselves			0
but @entity44 voted to require all body scanners to have privacy - protecting software , and the @entity16 announced in february it was phasing out backscatter systems because they could not meet the new standard			1
the last backscatter machines were removed about two weeks ago , a @entity16 spokesman said			2
all 250 units were removed at @entity36 's expense , the agency said			0
currently , there are more than 700 body scanners at about 165 airports , all with @entity58 ( @entity60 ) software , which display items on a generic body outline			1
@entity29 said he still has privacy concerns about millimeter wave machines , including what information is captured by the machine -- even if unseen by screeners -- and how long that information is retained			0
" we 'd like to see clearer rules about the collection of the images , " @entity29 said			0
" are they deleted ? are they saved ? is some analysis being done and can they be linked to passengers ? " most countries do not use body scanners , he said , preferring to use a combination of metal detection and technology that can identify explosives			2
backscatter machines could return one day if the company develops required software , the @entity16 has said .			0

backscatter full - body scanners generated *controversy*
critics said images were too *revealing* , others cited *potential* health concerns
@entity16 says it has met june 1 deadline to remove machines from airports
airport full - body screening will use different technology
