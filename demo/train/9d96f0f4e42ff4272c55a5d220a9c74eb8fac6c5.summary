@entity0 -- @entity2 has struggled to contain ethnic tensions in the far northwest region of @entity5 , recently launching a crackdown after a series of violent attacks left hundreds dead in recent months			1
but authorities think they may have found a new tonic to mend the cultural differences between the region 's indigenous @entity12 -- a mostly @entity16 , @entity15 - speaking group -- and @entity2 's dominant ethnic group , the @entity18			1
the wide - eyed @entity12 beauty is the protagonist of an upcoming cartoon based on the well - known tale of a girl from the city of @entity28 who captivated @entity2 's @entity30 with her good looks and sweet fragrance in the 18th century and became his concubine			1
according to the legend most @entity2 are familiar with , the girl fell in love with the emperor and became his cherished consort			1
" she is a figure that has contributed much to cross-cultural communication , " @entity38 , director of the cartoon , " princess @entity40 , " told @entity1			2
the animation is set to become a television series at the end of 2015 , and a film the following year			2
@entity38 's company , @entity47 , won a tender to create the 3 - d animation last year , as part of a campaign by @entity5 authorities to promote social harmony among @entity2 's different ethnic groups and raise awareness of the folk customs of the @entity12			1
during a visit to the province in june , @entity38 and his colleagues were inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture of @entity5 -- a region the size of @entity64 that shares borders with eight countries			1
" the cultures there and the folk arts are exquisite			0
but the place 's economy is less developed			0
so we wanted ... to help them promote their cultures , " he said			0
but appealing to both @entity77 audiences may prove a challenge			0
princess or sex slave ? selecting a musician to compose the theme song , for example , took over a year , @entity2 's @entity84 reports , because it was difficult to find a composer who was familiar with both @entity18 and @entity12 traditions			1
then there are the alternative versions of the @entity91 's story			0
although the legend of @entity95 has become a symbol of national unity for many @entity2 , modern uyghur interpretations of the tale portray her as an imperial sex slave who was murdered by the emperor 's mother after stubbornly rejecting the emperor 's advances			1
@entity38 said he wants the series to be entertaining while also fulfilling " political needs			1
" " ( the cartoon ) is a re-understanding of the friendship between @entity18 and @entity12 , which is especially significant to the re-education of the children and teaching them to accept different cultures			1
" his animation company , working in collaboration with the government of @entity28 , has plans to show the cartoon in @entity2 and abroad , especially in @entity118 regions			1
@entity5 has a long history of ethnic unrest			2
some @entity12 have expressed resentment toward the @entity18 in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment by security forces , discrimination and a lack of economic opportunities			2
@entity16 separatists have been held responsible for a series of recent deadly attacks , with @entity2 authorities launching an anti-terror campaign in may			2
measures to end the violence have ranged from executing convicted terrorists to banning beards and @entity118 dress in some areas			0
but authorities have not ignored the role of soft power			0
" it is similar as fighting a war in the realm of ideology			0
if we do n't pass on positive energy , the opposite side would occupy the battlefield , " @entity146 , a deputy director of cultural industry office at the @entity148 told the @entity84			2
finding common ground , however , was difficult even among the animators			0
some of the more conservative @entity5 artists who were consulted in the making of the cartoon objected to the use of animal characters because of the negative connotations associated with some creatures like snakes according to @entity118 traditions , and because @entity12 families rarely own pets , the @entity84 reports			1
" the difficulty is that you have to respect history and culture while catering to the market , " @entity38 said			0
when it came to the animals , @entity38 insisted they should stay			0
" it 's all about compromise , " he said			0
intern @entity176 contributed to this report .			0
