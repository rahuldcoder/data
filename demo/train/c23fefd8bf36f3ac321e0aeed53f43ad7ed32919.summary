-- without firing a shot , @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has achieved remarkable results in his efforts to counter @entity7 's nuclear program			1
in little more than a year , the prime minister has managed to move the @entity7 nuclear issue to the top of the international agenda , to toughen sanctions , and in an extraordinary move , to push @entity14 president @entity13 to strengthen @entity14 policy so that preventing @entity7 from acquiring nuclear weapons became the focus , rather than just containing @entity7 and its nuclear program			1
indeed , if you throw in @entity23 challenger @entity22 's unwillingness to accept @entity7 even having the capacity to produce a nuke , @entity1 's record is even better			1
but @entity2 's policy is approaching a point of diminishing returns			0
by stressing red lines it ca n't or wo n't enforce , @entity1 threatens to overplay his hand , irritate a close ally and undermine @entity2 's own credibility			1
news : @entity1 asks @entity36 to draw ' red line ' on @entity7 's nuclear bomb plans club @entity39 : who else is going to join ? the logic of getting a great many countries to sign on to some new line in the sand on paper might make sense			1
since @entity2 ca n't or wo n't ( yet ) enforce its own new red line -- @entity7 is moving to enrich higher levels of uranium -- it will require others to join it to be effective			1
but this is a club few seem ready to join			0
indeed , @entity2 's most important ally seems very reluctant to get locked into trip wires or red lines that might commit it to what @entity13 seems determined to try to avoid -- a military strike against @entity7 's nuclear sites			1
in fact , the cruel reality from @entity1 's perspective is that with the exception of @entity2 's government , which sees a putative military strike as a war of necessity , everyone else -- without exception -- sees it as a war of discretion			2
it has n't tested one and does n't have enough fissile material to produce one			0
nobody is ready for @entity80 redux , least of all an @entity14 president who is running on extricating @entity14 from costly and unpredictable wars , not getting the @entity14 into new ones			0
undermining deterrence the more @entity2 talks about red lines , green lights and military options without actually acting , the more its credibility and deterrent capacity is undermined			0
once a day and twice on sunday , @entity2 politicians are either talking or leaking why @entity2 is going to strike @entity7			2
these war scares are becoming something of a joke , truly			0
one @entity2 source told me that he was getting so tired of this @entity95 line that @entity2 ought to just hit the @entity7 and get it over with already			2
you can only imagine the chuckling going on in @entity99			0
this past spring a war scare prompted a parade of senior @entity14 officials to run to @entity2 to reassure their counterparts , then it was the " october surprise " scare that @entity2 would strike before the november elections			2
and now the prime minister has stated in his @entity109 speech that it would n't be until next spring , or at most by next summer , at current enrichment rates , that @entity7 will have finished the medium enrichment of nuclear fuel and move on to the final state , all but implying that @entity2 would probably not act until next year			2
you have to wonder why anyone would lay down red lines publicly if he ca n't credibly enforce them nor expect others to ? if red lines are to deter war not facilitate it as the prime minister says , then @entity99 would have to stop enriching uranium out of fear of an @entity2 strike			2
but given the reality that @entity7 knows @entity2 is bluffing , figures it can absorb and even exploit an @entity2 strike , and the @entity14 and the international community do n't want war , where 's the urgency ? in this case , there 's very little reason for the mullahs to worry			1
news : three things we learned from the @entity109 angering the president even without @entity7 to complicate it , the relationship between @entity13 and @entity1 is among the most dysfunctional in the history of the @entity14 - @entity2 story			1
there 's little sense of confidence and trust and a pronounced sense that each would like to close his eyes and make a wish that the other would disappear			0
@entity1 thinks @entity13 is bloodless and cold when it comes to understanding @entity2 's fears and its security challenges ; @entity13 thinks @entity1 is a conman who thinks only of himself with little sense of respect or sensitivity for @entity14 interests			1
indeed , one of the reasons @entity13 does n't want to endorse @entity1 's red lines is that it will make it harder for the @entity7 to cut a deal , and that is still @entity13 's preferred option			1
the @entity7 nuclear issue has actually made the relationship between the two leaders worse			2
by appearing to jam the president politically by questioning @entity13 's refusal publicly to accept red lines a month before an election , @entity1 -- with a good deal of help from @entity22 -- has thrown the nuclear issue into the middle of the campaign			1
only the interminably obtuse believe that @entity1 would n't prefer his friend @entity22 to be the next president			0
the president 's much publicized phone call today with @entity1 ( these calls are never touted this far in advance ) may help to keep matters from getting worse			0
but the @entity1 - @entity13 relationship could easily deteriorate , particularly if the president believes as he must that @entity1 wants his rival to win			2
the only thing worse for @entity1 than a re-elected @entity13 is an angry re-elected @entity13			0
the smart play for @entity1 would be to stop talking about @entity7 publicly at home and abroad , desist from creating the impression that he 's pressing the president before the elections and start a quiet dialogue with the @entity14 about how best to handle the period ahead			1
he should explore what assurances the @entity197 is prepared to give @entity2 and other @entity14 allies in the @entity200 and give the @entity14 three months to get through the elections and the immediate aftermath of the vote			0
this might actually create a greater sense of confidence that @entity1 was giving the @entity14 the benefit of the doubt and build up some currency in the bank which @entity2 will need if in fact it does decide it must go it alone against @entity7 in the spring			1
another several months will not matter			0
indeed , as former @entity2 military intelligence chief @entity215 has said , the zone of immunity may be much less important than the zone of trust between the two allies			0
whether through negotiations , diplomacy or war , the @entity14 and @entity2 will need one another to deal with the @entity7 nuclear threat			1
red lines are n't the answer -- lines of trust and communication between two allies are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			0

@entity234 : @entity2 @entity235 has scored some *victories* on @entity7 nuclear program
but he says @entity1 's new emphasis on drawing a red line is *counterproductive*
@entity2 politicians are crying wolf , threatening an attack that is n't *happening* , @entity232 says
@entity232 : *injecting* the issue into @entity14 election campaign further *alienates* president @entity13
