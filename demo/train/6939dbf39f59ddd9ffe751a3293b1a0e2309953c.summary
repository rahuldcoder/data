-- @entity1 has struck up a new , conciliatory chord on negotiations about its nuclear program			2
and its leaders say it 's eager to get down to business			0
foreign minister @entity10 reiterated @entity1 's apparent haste to reach an international agreement on its energy program in a statement monday			1
@entity10 hopes that together @entity1 and the @entity15 will be able to work out a " roadmap " a day after @entity1 presents its latest plan at the @entity17 to secure its energy independence and build international trust			1
he would like an additional meeting on wednesday in @entity22 , @entity23 , with ministers from the countries from the @entity26 in order to hammer out the details , he said on his @entity30 account			1
the meeting would include the @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 -- the countries with permanent seats on the @entity38 -- plus @entity39			1
" as i 've said before , a rather difficult and time consuming process begins tomorrow , " @entity10 wrote			0
" hopefully by wednesday we can agree on a roadmap to reach a solution			0
but even if the other party , in good faith , agrees on the details , a new ministerial meeting will be needed			0
" good faith @entity10 's statement follows an apparent about - face in @entity1 's tone towards the @entity31 and its @entity52 allies that has set in since the election in @entity1 of its new president , @entity54 , who replaced @entity55			1
@entity55 was known for caustic and threatening rhetoric towards the @entity31 and @entity57			0
@entity54 has struck a much friendlier tone			0
during his visit to the @entity61 in late september , @entity54 's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the @entity15 of a thaw with @entity1 and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program			2
many fear @entity1 is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb			0
@entity1 has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only			2
on message @entity10 's @entity30 post is not surprising and is on message with his own previous statements and with those of his colleague @entity78 , @entity1 's powerful speaker of the parliament and a close associate of @entity1 's supreme leader , @entity81			1
@entity1 is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program , and is keen to resolve the issue " in a short period of time , " the speaker of @entity1 's parliament , @entity78 , told @entity0 's @entity89 in an exclusive interview last week			1
" from @entity1 's side , i can say that we are ready , " @entity78 said from @entity22			1
" if the @entity31 and other countries say that @entity1 should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that , " he told @entity89 , " then we can clearly show and prove that			2
we have no such intention			0
so it can be resolved in a very short period of time			0
" nonetheless , @entity78 said , the @entity15 must accept @entity1 's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes , as allowed under the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , to which @entity1 is a signatory			1
critics have expressed suspicions over that enrichment , fearing the @entity1 may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb - grade materials			0
relaxing sanctions some believe that @entity1 's recent opening and seeming willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program may be a result of crippling sanctions on its economy			1
shortly after this year 's @entity61 ended , a @entity120 official said the @entity31 would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on @entity1 if it engaged in confidence - building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its disputed nuclear program			2
but this will take time and trust building			0
under secretary of state @entity128 , who is in @entity22 , has made clear that the entire sanctions regime targeting @entity1 would not be lifted " any time soon " unless the entire litany of concerns about @entity1 's nuclear program were fully addressed			1
@entity0 's @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report			0
