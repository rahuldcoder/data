-- some antiquated state driving laws are flat - out crazy			1
got a housecoat ? if you 're a woman , it 's illegal to wear one while driving in @entity5			2
but what about modern rules of the road that seem very unusual and can still result in a hefty fine ? in @entity5 , no vehicle without a driver may exceed 60 miles per hour			2
but who gets the ticket ? we 've collated some of the more irregular and disputed road laws from around the nation and have included , at the end , some of the more bizarre contributions that have kept our roads the safest in the world			1
driving too slowly in some states , including @entity5 , a dawdling motorist can be cited for driving too slowly			2
police officer @entity25 of the @entity26 says that while it 's not common , you could get a ticket if , " you 're blocking traffic or creating a road hazard on the freeway			1
" he mentions a couple reasons why someone would drive that slowly			2
the car could be suffering engine trouble or the driver could be impaired , for example			1
both will likely attract the attention of a police officer			0
drivers on city or rural roads are not exempt , says police officer @entity25			0
he adds , " just about anywhere , if you 're in the middle of an intersection or on a regular two - lane street and the speed limit is 45 [ mph ] and you 're doing 10 [ mph ] for no good reason , you can be cited for impeding traffic			1
" slow driving laws are enforced in most states , including @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , where tourists can be most at risk from the police scanner			1
you should also beware of rubbernecking accidents or police lights , which , while non-ticketable in most cases , does n't particularly help traffic cops do their jobs			1
red - light running @entity73 , @entity72 motorist @entity71 was ticketed by cameras earlier this month for running a red light			1
he told local station @entity76 that he crossed the stop line as the light was turning red , but that at his hearing the police officer gave him a different characterization of the stop line			1
the police officer says the stop line is a lateral line parallel to the curb of the cross street or , " ten feet farther out than where it actually starts			1
" @entity72 law states that the violation line is at the stop line before the crosswalk			1
the editor of road campaign site www.highwayrobbery.net , a businessman and activist who requested anonymity , tells @entity0 , " the law , as i understand it , is that you 're okay to proceed across the line if you can get any bit of your car ahead of the line			1
typically the limit line is the first line you come to if there 's a crosswalk -- which are sometimes surprisingly wide -- so the crosswalk can end up being 10 to 15 feet from the curbs of the crossing street			0
somebody looked at the pictures and realized that cities were using an imaginary line , sometimes that of the curb , that you have to get part of your car over to not get a ticket , an extra 12 - foot zone			1
" the governor of @entity72 has said he will sign a bill later this year to clear up confusion after scores of motorists ' complaints concerning crossing of violation lines , which is usually a civil offense			1
animals and cars @entity132 couple @entity131 , 26 , and his wife @entity133 , 25 , say they were the victims of a " cultural misunderstanding " after they were arrested and held in @entity135 several years ago			0
they had left their six - month - old daughter in the car while they went to @entity141 mall			2
they said nobody in @entity144 would condemn their actions , but under @entity148 law , they faced a sentence of one year for child endangerment if they were found guilty			0
the case was eventually dropped			0
now it 's illegal in many states to leave an animal alone in a car , and with good reason			1
the @entity158 points out that , even with the vehicle 's windows left slightly open , an outside temperature of 85 degrees can cause a temperature of 102 degrees inside a vehicle within 10 minutes , and 120 degrees within half of an hour			0
as dogs breathe differently from humans , their central nervous systems can be overwhelmed in less than 15 minutes from excessive heat			0
@entity5 governor @entity169 last year signed into law @entity170 , which bans owners from leaving animals unattended in a motor vehicle " under conditions that endanger the health or well being of an animal due to heat , cold , lack of adequate ventilation , or lack of food or water , or other circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause suffering , disability , or death to the animal			0
" first - time violators are fined $ 100 , with a second offense garnering a possible six - month jail term			0
also remember , smoking with children of car - seat age in the car will draw you heat in @entity72 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 among others			1
as of yet , there is no law about smoking with pets in the car			2
carpool violations several states face the thorny issue of their carpool lanes moving too slowly			0
some carpoolers have accused single - occupant hybrid drivers of soft - pedaling to save gas			0
but from @entity5 to the @entity212 , it seems the sheer volume of cars using the carpool lanes has slowed the lanes enough to almost destroy the incentive of car - pooling or owning a hybrid car			2
@entity5 is considering allowing motorists to exit and enter the carpool lane at will , when previously crossing the double yellow was an offense			0
the state transportation agency has warned against increasing the occupancy of carpool cars from two to three in @entity227 , like it is in @entity228			0
beware that buying an easily recognizable hybrid such as a prius now does not mean automatic rights to use the carpool lane , at least in the @entity233			0
this is something police officers are well aware of given the recent shortage of available hybrid permits			0
the black market for scarce carpool lane exemptions has put up to a $ 5,000 premium on sales of used prius that carry the exemption sticker			0
the ridiculous an assortment of seemingly crazy state driving laws exists and can be found easily across the @entity246			2
most of these examples are sourced from newspapers and come from the site @entity251 , whose editors did not respond to a call for comment			0
here goes : in @entity5 , no vehicle without a driver may exceed 60 miles per hour			0
in @entity57 , if an elephant , goat or alligator is left tied to a parking meter , the parking fee has to be paid just as it would for a vehicle			0
in @entity264 , it is illegal to have a sheep in the cab of your truck without a chaperone			1
in @entity270 , a door on a car may not be left open longer than necessary			2
in @entity274 , it is illegal shoot any game other than whales from a moving automobile			1
good luck finding a whale in @entity274 ! e-mail to a friend			1

some traffic laws leave everyone scratching their heads
it is ok to shoot whales from your car in @entity274
no sheep allowed in @entity264 truck cabs without a chaperone
@entity72 *battle* over where to stop when light turns red
