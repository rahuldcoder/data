-- president @entity1 must do well in the debate monday or he risks losing the national security advantage that @entity4 have struggled so hard to regain			1
@entity1 was able to ward off @entity6 's attacks about @entity7 in the second debate , when @entity6 tripped up on one word , " terror , " which contradicted the public record			1
but tonight , the @entity12 will have 90 minutes to take on the president 's national security program in more systematic fashion			1
with last week 's capture of a terrorist who was planning to bomb the @entity19 and a brutal bombing of civilians in @entity22 , national security issues are heating up			1
@entity4 stand a lot to lose			1
for several decades , the public trusted @entity12 on the issue of national security			1
since @entity27 , @entity12 hammered away at @entity4 as being weak on defense and unwilling to do what was necessary to protect the nation			1
in 2004 , president @entity31 eviscerated his opponent , @entity33 sen. @entity32 , with this argument			0
though @entity32 began the @entity35 by highlighting his credentials as a @entity27 veteran , the @entity12 developed an entire campaign around the question of whether @entity4 could be trusted to prosecute the war on terrorism			1
for all of @entity1 's struggles with the economy , @entity4 have made huge strides in the past six years			1
the reversal of partisan fortunes began toward the end of @entity31 's presidency , when the @entity49 was struggling to avoid total chaos in @entity51 , a war that was highly unpopular			2
@entity4 took control of @entity54 in the 2006 elections , partially in response to @entity31 's decision to go to war in @entity51 and his handling of it			1
in the 2008 presidential election , @entity1 made @entity31 's war a centerpiece of his campaign			1
he promised to bring the war to an end and to reverse those components of the war on terrorism that had violated civil liberties			0
as president , @entity1 continued to neutralize many of his critics			0
he left intact most of @entity31 's counterterrorism program , in some cases intensifying operations such as drone airstrikes against @entity77 , and he made it difficult for conservatives to say that he was not doing enough			2
after @entity80 was killed by special operations forces , even @entity12 had to praise the courageous operation			0
@entity1 accelerated the war in @entity84 and brought the controversial war in @entity51 to a close			0
while many on the left have been frustrated that @entity1 retained so much of the status quo , politically the president positioned himself as the person who was tougher on defense			0
during the @entity35 , he railed against @entity6 for having failed to salute the troops in his acceptance speech and for a series of embarrassing gaffes that took place when @entity6 traveled overseas this summer			0
in september , @entity98 found that 53 % of those surveyed trusted @entity1 to make wise decisions on foreign policy , compared with 38 % for @entity6			0
but in recent weeks , the advantage seems to be eroding			1
the outbreak of violence in the @entity105 and the @entity49 's contradictory statements about a deadly @entity77 attack at the @entity109 @entity108 in @entity110 , @entity7 , have opened up space for @entity12 to go after the administration on this front			2
vice president @entity115 's statements during his debate against @entity117 that neither he nor the president knew about security threats , along with secretary of state @entity120 taking responsibility , certainly did not help			1
sen. @entity122 , @entity123 , told @entity124 , " i think it 's very laudable that she should throw herself under the bus			2
but first of all , responsibility for @entity109 security does n't lie with the secretary of state			2
it lies with the president of the @entity109			0
it 's either willful deception or a degree of incompetence and failure to understand fundamental facts on the ground			2
... either one of those is obviously totally unacceptable			0
" @entity1 has tried to push back against all of this criticism , including his statement in the second debate that he himself has ultimate responsibility , but the @entity12 ' singular attacks have continued nonetheless			2
administration officials must be careful if they think there is no risk			0
aside from 2008 , there are many years in which parties lost their advantage on national security			1
in 1952 , @entity4 still thought of themselves as the party that had won @entity155 and set up @entity109 's @entity157 strategy against the @entity158			1
republicans hit back when @entity160 faced off against @entity161 , a @entity155 military hero			0
republicans attacked democrats for being weak on fighting communism , for a military stalemate in @entity166 and for having allowed @entity167 to fall to communism in 1949			0
@entity161 won the presidency , and republicans took control of @entity54			0
just a few years later , @entity12 saw their advantage slip away			2
though @entity161 was an immensely popular president and one who , as @entity174 shows in his masterful new book " @entity176 , " demonstrated immense skills at diplomacy , @entity172 ran as more of a hawk than @entity161 's vice president , @entity180 , did in 1960			0
he built on arguments that @entity4 had made in the 1950s , that @entity12 were so focused on balancing the budget they were not spending enough on defense to win the presidency			2
" our security , " he said , " has declined more rapidly than over any comparable period in our history -- in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory power , in terms of our alliances , in terms of our scientific effort and reputation			0
" republicans struggled again in 1992 when president @entity198 watched as his advantage , which had apparently been cemented with the successful @entity200 in 1990 - 1991 that resulted in the expulsion of @entity51 forces from @entity203 , slip away			0
while @entity31 did not devote enough attention to the economy , it was also @entity208 's continued military attacks on his opponents in @entity211 cease - fire zones that seemed to demonstrate @entity31 's victory had been incomplete			0
" it 's like any other bully , " presidential candidate @entity213 said then , " you send ' em mixed messages , they 'll take advantage of you every time			1
" the politics of national security is tricky , and uncontrollable events can easily push politics in a different direction			1
@entity1 will have to answer some of the tough questions that have emerged , and this time @entity6 is going to be prepared to handle them more effectively and to show that his overall agenda still offers the @entity109 the best path forward			0
monday 's debate can have a big impact , not just on the outcome in november , but on how the public thinks about whom they should trust when it comes to national security			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

monday 's presidential debate may be *crucial* , says @entity238
@entity4 ' national security advantage hangs in the balance , he says
only in recent weeks has their advantage seemed to be eroding , @entity238 says
@entity238 : national security is often the *deciding* factor in presidential elections
