-- @entity1 ended 10 - man @entity3 's hopes of winning a trophy this season with a 2 - 1 home victory that put @entity9 's side into the semifinals of the @entity11 for the fourth time in five seasons			1
a goal in each half from @entity15 and @entity16 ensured a 3 - 1 aggregate win for the @entity19 leaders , who beat @entity3 in the 2008 final on penalties in @entity22			1
@entity1 will next face either defending @entity24 champions @entity25 or @entity26 , who hold a 5 - 2 lead ahead of wednesday 's second leg in @entity30			1
the future of @entity3 coach @entity32 is now in considerable doubt after a disappointing season which has seen the @entity37 side 's domestic title reign realistically over with seven games to play			1
@entity32 in troubled waters at @entity40 the @entity41 raised eyebrows when he chose to start misfiring $ 80 million signing @entity43 up front with @entity45 and @entity46 flanking him , leaving former spearhead @entity47 on the bench			2
the @entity50 striker made an immediate impact after replacing @entity43 at halftime , and got @entity3 back into the match soon after @entity54 ' 70th - minute sending - off -- only for poor defending to allow @entity1 to regain a two - goal overall lead straight away			2
" a lot of people thought @entity47 would play , " @entity9 told reporters			0
" i thought having signed @entity43 for the money they did they had to play him			0
i was n't 100 % sure but i could n't see how they could leave @entity43 out			0
" @entity32 admitted he might have made a mistake in starting the @entity66 striker , who has not scored since leaving @entity67 at the end of january			0
i told you a lot of times this season i wanted to start with @entity43 for this kind of game , these type of tactics , " the former @entity70 coach said			0
" @entity47 played well in the second half			0
i wanted to put more pressure up front because we needed to score			0
@entity47 was fresh and he could use his power up front			0
this was the reason i took out @entity43			0
" the home side , having survived some early scares , thought they had scored in the 27th minute when @entity15 stole in at the near post to head home @entity91 's cross , but the @entity92 international strayed marginally offside			2
the breakthrough came two minutes before halftime as veteran @entity96 combined well with @entity97 to burst into the right side of the penalty area and slide a pinpoint low cross with his favored left foot to an unmarked @entity15 at the far post			1
@entity104 record as @entity105 go through @entity32 replaced @entity45 , the club 's top scorer in @entity107 this season , with @entity109 after an hour but @entity1 could have gone further ahead as goalkeeper @entity110 did well to keep out a low shot from @entity112 and then @entity96 aimed a weak header after more good work by @entity91			1
@entity54 , who was denied a penalty in injury - time in the first leg at @entity117 last week , received his second yellow card after a tackle from behind on @entity112			0
the first , also for a foul on the @entity122 midfielder in the opening half , had already meant the @entity125 midfielder would have been suspended for the first leg of the semifinal if @entity3 had progressed			2
with @entity112 replaced by @entity128 in the 75th minute , @entity3 took advantage to level on the night as @entity130 picked out @entity47 with a lofted through pass and the 33 - year - old chested the ball down and fired a low shot past @entity135			2
@entity91 gives @entity1 the edge but @entity3 's excitement lasted less than 30 seconds as @entity1 surged forward , with @entity91 and @entity96 combining to set up hard - working @entity138 -- who slotted in a low left - foot shot			1
it was the 37 - year - old @entity96 ' third assist of the quarterfinal , having also set up @entity91 's first - leg winner			1
the win kept @entity1 , the @entity24 runners - up in 2009 , on course for a treble this season ahead of saturday 's @entity147 semifinal against local rivals @entity148 .			1

@entity1 win all - @entity151 semifinal 3 - 1 on aggregate after home victory
@entity15 and @entity16 score either side of @entity47 's *equalizer*
veteran @entity96 sets up both @entity1 goals to add to his first - leg assist
@entity3 coach @entity32 faces the sack as last chance of *silverware* ends
