@entity0 , @entity1 -- with @entity8 gov. @entity7 threatening to cement his standing atop the national polls , his rivals for the @entity6 presidential nomination aggressively sought to undermine his conservative credentials on monday during the first - ever @entity2 / @entity13 debate in @entity1			1
@entity7 repeatedly found himself in the crosshairs , as the field of candidates took turns attacking his positions on illegal immigration , @entity20 , and his controversial 2007 push to vaccinate @entity8 schoolgirls against human papillomavirus , a common sexually transmitted disease that can lead to cervical cancer			1
@entity27 rep. @entity26 , whose standing among @entity6 has slipped dramatically since @entity7 entered the race , said she was " offended " by @entity7 's executive order , which included an opt - out provision for parents who did not want the vaccine			1
" to have innocent little 12 year old girls to be forced to have government injections through an executive order is just flat - out wrong , " @entity26 said			2
former @entity37 sen. @entity36 -- like @entity26 , a staunch social conservative struggling to gain traction in the polls -- also pounced			0
" this is big government run amok , " @entity36 said to applause			0
" it is bad policy and it should not have been done			0
" @entity7 said he regretted his decision to push for the vaccine using an executive order , but said he was standing up against cancer			2
" at the end of the day i am always going to err on the side of life , " @entity7 said			0
" at the end of the day this was about trying to solve cancer			0
" @entity7 was also attacked by his opponents for signing the @entity55 in 2001 , which granted in - state tuition to some children of illegal immigrants			0
and former @entity61 gov. @entity60 chided @entity7 for referring to @entity20 as a " @entity62 " and vowed to protect the program			1
@entity60 called such language " over the top " and said that @entity7 wrote in his book " @entity67 ! " that the entitlement program is unconstitutional			2
@entity7 said @entity60 is trying to " scare " seniors who rely on the federal program			2
when @entity60 persisted on the constitutionality question , @entity7 said the nation needed to have a serious conversation on the issue , which prompted @entity60 to cut him off by saying " we 're having that conversation right now , governor			2
" other candidates then joined in , with former house speaker @entity79 earning applause from the crowd of conservative tea party supporters by saying the issue was n't about who was scaring senior citizens when , he said , president @entity86 was scaring the nation every day			0
@entity26 and @entity7 squared off on the vaccination situation , with @entity26 saying , " we can not forget that in the midst of this executive order there 's a big drug company that made millions of dollars because of this			1
" she added that a former @entity7 aide was a lobbyist for the company and asked if the issue was about saving lives or money			2
@entity7 responded that the company , @entity100 , made a $ 5,000 contribution and said to @entity26 : " if you 're saying i can be bought for $ 5,000 , i 'm offended			1
" " i 'm offended by what happened to all those girls , " @entity26 said of the required vaccination of girls as young as 12 against cervical cancer			2
@entity7 also said that the executive order was a mistake and he should have worked with the legislature instead of issuing it			0
he also noted the order gave parents the right to opt their children out of the vaccination			0
the debate at the @entity118 in @entity0 gave the other candidates on the stage a chance to change what many are portraying as a two - person race between @entity7 and @entity60			1
@entity2 and the @entity133 , a leading national tea party organization , teamed up to put on the event , with questions coming from the moderator , @entity2 anchor @entity131 , as well as from tea party activists , supporters in the audience and voters at locations in @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
participants included @entity7 , @entity60 , @entity26 , @entity139 , @entity36 , @entity8 rep. @entity140 , former @entity141 and former @entity143 ambassador to @entity145 @entity144 and former @entity147 ceo @entity146			1
@entity7 , the new guy in the race and the current front - runner in the national polls , and @entity60 , the previous front - runner in the @entity6 battle , sparred over jobs and @entity20 at a debate last week at the @entity156 in @entity157 , @entity158			1
they continued the battle monday			0
when @entity131 noted @entity7 's success creating jobs in @entity8 , @entity60 cited what he called advantages to accomplishing such success in that state , including no income tax , lots of oil and a @entity6 - controlled state legislature			1
" if you 're dealt four aces , that does n't necessarily make you a great poker player , " @entity60 said in the best zinger of the early going			1
if voters believe all of @entity143 is like @entity8 , then they should choose someone with success in @entity8 , @entity60 continued , adding that if voters believe the nation needs to be turned around , " that 's what i do			0
" @entity7 responded to @entity60 : " you were doing pretty good until you got to talking poker			1
" in the @entity158 debate last week , @entity7 stood by earlier comments that @entity20 is a " @entity62 " and that it was a " monstrous lie " to tell young workers that the 74 - year - old pension system would be there when they retire			1
@entity60 fired back , saying that " under no circumstances would i ever say by any measure it 's a failure			0
it is working for millions of @entity143 , and i 'll keep it working for millions of @entity143			0
" since then , both candidates have swung at each other through e-mail and social media			0
in a radio interview , @entity60 went a step further			0
" if we nominate someone who the @entity203 can correctly characterize as being opposed to @entity20 , we would be obliterated as a party , " he said			0
@entity7 's team fired back , noting that in @entity60 's policy book " no apology , " the former @entity61 governor compared the management of @entity20 to a felony			1
when that issue came up monday , @entity60 said @entity7 was misquoting him from the book			2
as for @entity60 's charge that @entity7 would possibly abolish the popular government program , @entity7 's team says that the @entity8 governor believes that @entity20 must be protected for current beneficiaries and those nearing retirement age			1
in a a @entity219 op - ed released monday by @entity7 , he declined to use the phrase " @entity62 " but called for a " frank , honest national conversation about fixing @entity20 to protect benefits for those at or near retirement while keeping faith with younger generations , who are being asked to pay			1
" @entity26 , who is vying for tea party support with @entity7 , also has tried to inject herself into the @entity20 discussion			1
monday 's debate was crucial to @entity26 , who has dropped in national polling since @entity7 launched his campaign on august 13 , the very same day that she won a crucial straw poll in @entity236 , @entity237			2
