have you heard that it all comes down to turnout ? of course you have , because politicians say it every november			0
but the act of getting voters to the polls is much more than a shopworn cliche			1
there 's an entire industry in @entity12 politics built around finding and mobilizing voters , largely constructed by @entity14 who have been innovating in the field for more than a decade			1
the nerd science of campaigning -- sifting through data , analyzing behavior , modeling segments of voters and persuading people to cast ballots -- is one reason president @entity27 's team flabbergasted @entity29 's overconfident numbers - crunchers in 2012			1
many of those same @entity14 operatives are on the front lines of the 2014 midterm elections , mining the electorate , state - by - state , to find enough voters to tip a race one or two points in their direction			1
having a well - oiled field operation is never enough to overcome a bad national climate or a bum candidate at the top of the ticket			0
but in a tight campaign like so many of the deadlocked 2014 races it can make a serious difference			0
@entity49 back on the air in @entity51 with advanced analytics and targeting , the @entity27 team in 2012 narrow - casted its message to persuadable voters -- on @entity55 , on television , on @entity57 , on well - placed billboards , on doorsteps , wherever -- and tilted swing state electorates in their favor			1
it was done efficiently , without wasting money on television ads or mailers that were hitting the wrong households			0
in press reports after the campaign , @entity27 's tech savants were hailed as " gurus " and " masterminds			1
" they were n't always so celebrated			1
" on the @entity79 campaign in 2004 , they put the internet team -- they called us the internet team , not digital -- next to the it team , and most people would come over and ask us to fix their printers , " says @entity74 , the founder of @entity75 , one the @entity14 's premier digital firms			1
" that was how little people understood , " he says			1
" it was n't until we started to produce metrics that people understood that people took us seriously			1
so raising money was the first big one			0
we raised $ 87 million in 2004			0
and then people said , all right			2
" @entity74 was a grunt on the @entity79 campaign			0
but like many of his young colleagues , he was a pioneer			0
@entity74 , now 29 , went on to steer digital marketing for both of @entity27 's innovative campaigns , launching @entity105 along the way to build full - spectrum digital campaigns for @entity14			1
@entity108 is returning to @entity109 along with @entity27 , they 've helped elect @entity111 in 2012 as well as @entity113 mayor @entity112 and @entity115 gov. @entity114 in 2013			0
this cycle , @entity105 is doing independent expenditure work for @entity14 party committees as well as @entity119 , the @entity121 - funded environmental outfit			1
in a fragmented and self - segregating media world , defined by declining television viewership and skyrocketing mobile usage , the digital geeks of 2004 are now at the chief innovators of voter targeting			2
" in 2004 , there were like 30 of us in a horrible dive bar , " said @entity128 , a veteran of @entity130 's presidential campaign and a partner a @entity105			2
" we started off in the back of the campaign , with no access , no insight and no budget			2
now we are at the forefront of how you reach voters and change sentiment online			2
" by matching voter files with consumer data and online behavior , @entity105 creates models of voting universes and devises clever , eye - catching ways to engage with them in the digital space , where attention spans are notoriously short			2
the " @entity155 " poster displayed prominently in its @entity154 offices is less a joke than a guiding principle			0
their goals -- fundraising , persuasion , mobilization -- are as varied as the tools they employ			0
they produce online video , display ads , micro-sites , @entity55 and @entity170 campaigns and email blasts for their candidates			2
" we know how to reach people that are low tv watchers , " says @entity173 , a @entity105 partner with a background in corporate marketing and communications			2
" we know from our modeling that 33 % , as high as 40 % , of voters might not be watching any television			2
so if you are spending the majority of budget on television , guess what ? you are probably not getting any of that 40 %			0
" with election day less than two weeks away , their offices resemble a day - trading firm , with scores of smartly - dressed young operatives glued to their computers and pushing out content aimed at mobilizing voters			1
" right now , we are optimizing our campaigns , " @entity128 says			0
" the strategy has been set			0
we know the story of the candidates			0
we have really good content and video and sites to direct people towards			2
" " @entity205 , " " data , " " field , " " micro-targeting " -- the terms are often confused or lumped together as catchall shorthand for whatever it was the @entity27 campaign did on its @entity214 computers to mobilize auto workers in @entity216 or @entity217 in @entity218			2
the truth is that they are each discrete domains , each requiring its own expertise and methods			0
democrats , the successful ones at least , have won by synchronizing those activities both inside their campaign offices and across the spectrum of left - leaning interest groups , ensuring that the right voters are getting the right message at exactly the right time and place			0
another truth : @entity14 are still better at most of it than @entity236			1
" republicans are still very much in the television persuasion model , " said @entity237 , who led digital strategy for @entity29 's campaign and runs @entity240 , a leading @entity236 digital firm			1
" we are still having philosophical arguments about where we are , and meanwhile the @entity14 arguing about the type of targeting to use			1
" after getting walloped in the field in 2012 , the @entity236 vowed to overhaul their digital and data efforts			0
in many ways , they have			0
the @entity251 , for instance , added a team of data scientists , juiced its email marketing and fundraising efforts ( remember those @entity257 socks ? ) , and created a widely - used app for door - to - door canvassers			0
today , 70 % of @entity251 voter data being collected in the field is done digitally â € ” up from just 5 % last cycle			0
outside groups like @entity264 and @entity265 have also revamped their data and digital programs , tapping into the @entity251 's voter file , @entity269 , and i360 , another data hub affiliated with the @entity272 financial network			1
opinion : why the ' seinfeld election ' matters but while @entity236 have developed the tools and can point to a bevy of talented digital strategists in their ranks , they still have n't matched the culture or the manpower of the @entity14 tech world that 's been blossoming for over a decade			1
there are schools and training programs in @entity14 circles focused on field organizing and data ; @entity74 himself teaches one at @entity292			1
and there 's a tradition of sharing information and best practices that 's been well - established over the years , spearheaded by left - leaning interest groups and labor unions that began experimenting with voter contact techniques during the @entity300 years			0
@entity237 is confident @entity236 will catch up			0
it will take time , he says , for the party 's established consultant class , schooled in tv - buying , to understand the importance of data and digital advertising			1
" it 's not that @entity236 are n't building tools , " he says			1
" the tools are there , it 's just a question of why are n't people choosing to use them			1

there 's an entire industry to find and mobilize voters
bully @entity75 is a premier @entity14 digital firm
