@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new @entity4 video shows images of what appears to be an imagined missile attack on @entity9 government buildings in @entity10 , including the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
the roughly 4 - minute video was posted monday on the @entity15 channel of the @entity4 government website @entity17			1
it carries a montage of clips of different weapons , including artillery guns firing and large missiles on display at military parades			0
just before the three - minute mark , it cuts to footage of the @entity11 in an electronic sight 's crosshairs , and then a simulated explosion of the @entity12 's dome			1
at the same time , the voice narrating the video says , " the @entity11 has been captured in the view of our long - range missile , and the capital of war is within the range of our atomic bomb			1
" analysts say that @entity43 is still years away from being able to target nuclear missiles at the @entity9			0
@entity9 lawmaker questions @entity4 leader 's ' stability ' but the video 's release comes amid spiking tensions between @entity51 and @entity10 after the @entity52 voted to impose tougher sanctions on @entity43 following its latest nuclear test last month			1
in a slew of angry rhetoric in response to the @entity52 vote , @entity43 has threatened to carry out a pre-emptive nuclear attack on the @entity9 and @entity1 and said it was nullifying the armistice agreement that stopped the @entity61 in 1953			0
