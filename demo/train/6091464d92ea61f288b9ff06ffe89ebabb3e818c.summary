@entity0 , @entity1 -- like many i have been anxiously waiting the outcome of the @entity1 " forest peace talks			1
" but unlike most , i have done so 200 feet ( 60 meters ) above the ground , perched at the top of an old growth tree whose fate depends upon them			1
a tree i climbed 10 months ago and vowed not to leave until the forests were protected			1
and then on saturday the news hit -- the talks had collapsed			1
the two years of talks between environment groups , unions and industry representatives failed to find the resolution to bring the industry out of crisis and protect @entity1 's high conservation value forests			1
no deal means clear - felling of old growth forests is set to continue			1
the tree that has been my home since december 14 last year is a part of 572,000 hectares at the center of the debate			1
verified by scientific experts to be of world heritage value , it should have have been on its way to formal protection			2
and i should have been on my way out of this tree and into a long hot bath ! unfortunately the forestry industry had other ideas , digging in its heels when it came to final crunch			1
neither the science nor the economics seem to have won out			0
the @entity1 forestry industry is in crisis and being propped up by tax payer funds			0
there are some who may want to put their heads in the sand , but we can not go on ignoring today 's market realities of a worldwide trend towards environmentally friendly products			0
from my tree top platform , i have skyped my way around the globe , speaking to thousands of people			1
and the message is clear , people do n't want to buy furniture and flooring made from the destruction of endangered species habitat , community water catchments or globally significant carbon sinks			0
the failure of the talks has created uncertainty for the future of the forests here			1
and with it , uncertainty for me			0
with no end in sight , who knows how long it will be before i set foot on the ground again ? i have already become the @entity80 record holder for the longest time spent in a tree , after i reached 209 days back in july this year			1
i hope , for the sake of the forests , that i will not need to break the world record held by @entity85 , who sat for two years in a @entity86			0
' @entity87 ' takes its toll on @entity89 's environment in the upper branches of this 400 - year - old tree i have endured high wind , snow , hail and extreme conditions			1
it 's been a tough winter , that 's for sure			0
and the weather is n't the only challenge			0
living on a three meter platform suspended in the tree tops adds difficulty to every daily task that i once took for granted			2
no turning on the tap for hot water or going to the shops if you run out of milk ! i have to bathe in a small bucket			0
and i haul up everything i need on a long rope , relying on support from the community for donations of food and supplies			0
luckily support has flooded in , from all walks of life , locally and internationally			0
the many people who visit the base of the tree to say thank you have been overwhelmingly inspirational			2
and it has helped me get through what is the hardest part of this experience -- the loneliness of being separated from my loved ones			0
yet , no matter how challenging , there are constantly moments when i am awe - struck by the beauty of this forest			1
the coating of snow across the forest in winter , the star speckled skies of summer nights or watching endangered wedge - tailed eagles soar in the skies above			1
i have watched the seasons come and go			0
and with it , new life in the forest			2
conservationists placed hidden cameras in the forest below , capturing footage of a mother @entity148 , the day before logging began			2
this iconic @entity80 species is listed as endangered in both federal and state legislation			0
luckily , the media spotlight from my action had the loggers packing up and leaving after a week , giving these young devils a chance of survival			2
in february 2012 , to our delight , footage was taken of the juvenile devils exploring the world			0
sadly , with the collapse of the talks , logging of their habitat could begin again any day now			2
@entity170 color around the world many people ask my why i am willing to sacrifice everything in my life , give up my chance to spend time with family and friends , and put my career as a high school teacher on hold , in order to sit in a tree			2
but when i look around me at this unique and irreplaceable ecosystem the answer is simple : i sit in this tree because from here i believe it is possible to save this forest once and for all			1
of course , it takes more than one woman perched 60 meters above the ground ; it takes an international community			0
and i have been able to share my story with the world , powered by solar panels and blogging about my tree top life			2
i hope my action will be a catalyst , inspiring others to say no to wood products that come from unsustainable forestry practices			0
and say yes to the protection of the world 's globally significant forests			0
despite the cloud of uncertainty that now looms over the future of these forests , i am one hundred percent committed to staying in this tree for as long as it takes to see this forest receive the protection it deserves			1
