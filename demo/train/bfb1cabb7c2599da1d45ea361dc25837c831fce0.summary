@entity0 -- the @entity2 for now has ordered @entity3 not to enforce a law that had effectively shut down several clinics that provide abortions			1
the court 's order means those clinics can reopen immediately			0
the restrictions had gone into effect in recent days , but a number of abortion rights supporters then asked the justices to intervene on an emergency basis			0
the 6 - 3 order tuesday from the high court was a setback for the law 's backers			1
a ruling by a federal appeals court earlier this month gave @entity3 the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be " ambulatory surgical centers , " regulated under the same standards as hospitals			1
another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital			0
abortion rights groups said 13 reproductive health clinics were forced to immediately close after the court ruling , leaving all but eight still operating			1
the high court 's action would only have temporary effect , until more appeals can be filed on the larger questions of the @entity3 law 's constitutionality			1
that process may take several months , at least , to resolve at the appeals court level			0
the @entity2 refused to intervene previously when other sections of the @entity3 law were challenged in court			1
lawmakers in the state 's @entity52 - majority legislature have said the regulations would improve patient care and safety			1
abortion rights groups counter , saying the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in @entity3			1
the @entity61 had sued @entity3 this past spring , on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics			1
in august , a federal judge ruled that the " ambulatory surgical centers " requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction			0
thursday 's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allowed the measure to go into effect immediately			2
abortion rights groups cheered the justices ' intervention			0
" the @entity76 @entity2 gave @entity3 women a tremendous victory today , " said @entity75 , president of the @entity61			1
" this fight against @entity3 ' sham abortion law is not over			2
@entity81 was designed to gut the constitutional protections of @entity83 and half of the state 's clinics remain closed			0
" there was no immediate reaction from state officials to the @entity2 's one - page order , which justices @entity91 , @entity93 and @entity94 opposed			2
a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office , who earlier defended the law , said it was passed after " careful deliberation by the @entity100 to craft a law to protect the health and safety of @entity3 women			2
" abortion rights groups counter the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options , and called the appeals court decision " demonstrably wrong			2
" clinic supporters said before the bill was enacted , there were 41 facilities in @entity3 providing abortions			0
the law also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for " abortion - inducing drugs " such as @entity120			2
critics contend the law , in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state , will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous " back - alley " abortions			0
@entity133 gov. @entity133 signed the bill into law last year			0
the high court case is @entity137 v. @entity138 ( @entity139 ) .			0

strict new law caused some @entity3 abortion clinics to close
ruling 6 - 3 , the @entity2 tells @entity3 not to enforce that law for now
the action will only have temporary effect , until more appeals can be filed
@entity3 lawmakers said the regulations would improve patient care and safety
