@entity0 -- the words " budget " and " compromise " have n't been connected in @entity5 in recent years			1
but legislators stunned observers and perhaps each other this week when @entity8 and @entity9 proved that they can , indeed , agree on government spending			1
@entity8 rep. @entity8 and @entity9 sen. @entity11 worked out a budget framework to fund the government into 2015			1
the @entity14 approved the compromise agreement thursday			0
the measure now goes to the @entity17 , where it is expected to pass as early as next week			0
the @entity14 supports the proposal			0
it was the first full budget agreement by a divided @entity5 -- in which different parties control the @entity14 and @entity17 -- since 1986 , @entity8 boasted in announcing the deal			1
after years of bruising political fights over spending and the federal borrowing limit , dysfunction reigned supreme in october when the government shut down for 16 days			1
a short - term spending plan got it going again , but a @entity1 / @entity30 poll found that 71 % of @entity31 thought another shutdown would occur when the money ran out in january			2
instead , such repeated budget brinksmanship would be put on hold if @entity5 passes the @entity37 proposal			0
while neither side loves the compromise legislation , it appears to be on a path to approval			0
so , what changed this time ? @entity8 leaders stood up for two years , the most conservative members of the @entity8 , with the help of outside conservative groups , have been driving the agenda in the @entity8 - led @entity14			1
house speaker @entity49 endured humiliating leadership lapses when he was unable to corral sufficient votes from his majority caucus for legislation and agreements opposed by the @entity56 wing			0
the government shutdown in october was apparently the last straw			1
led by tea party conservatives , @entity8 forced a showdown over their demand to dismantle @entity62			1
when @entity9 balked , the public blamed the @entity8 for the dysfunction			1
plummeting poll numbers emboldened @entity49 and other establishment republicans to assert their leadership this time by defying conservative opposition to the budget agreement			2
in particular , @entity49 has blamed outside conservative groups that exert influence on @entity8 politics for pushing @entity8 legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in october			1
" the day before the government re-opened , one of these groups stood up and said ' well , we never really thought it would work , ' " he told reporters thursday before animatedly asking : " are you kidding me ? " at the same time , @entity49 and other @entity8 leaders want to keep the political focus on problems with @entity62 , such as the botched launch of the @entity87 website and policy cancellations despite president @entity90 's promise that people could keep coverage they liked			1
rep. @entity8 : from @entity8 vp candidate to fiscal deal maker in defense of defense in general , members of @entity5 hated the untargeted forced spending cuts known as sequestration from a 2011 agreement , albeit for different reasons			2
@entity9 disliked the indiscriminate nature of the dramatic spending reductions , with priorities such as education and social programs targeted equally with other less - valued categories			2
republicans , meanwhile , opposed the deep cuts to military spending that top generals said weakened @entity31 's defense readiness			0
the budget deal would eliminate $ 45 billion worth of sequester cuts set to hit in january , as well as another $ 18 billion scheduled for 2015			0
defense secretary @entity116 praised the agreement thursday , saying it provided certainty for military planning			0
" this agreement does not solve all ( @entity123 ) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training , in particular , and procurement , " said @entity121 , a former @entity8 senator			1
" it also gives us some new certainty , predictability for our planning , for our budgeting over the next two years which is particularly important , " he added			2
no one likes @entity5 years of dysfunction have really torpedoed the public 's view of @entity5			0
after the october government shutdown , a @entity1 / @entity30 poll showed only 14 % of respondents expressed satisfaction with how the government was operating			1
by comparison , 26 % of people were dissatisfied with the government during the @entity148			0
@entity5 was under pressure from the public as well as the business community , including the influential @entity152 , which warned that another manufactured government crisis would harm the economy			2
perhaps lawmakers are sick of being the least popular kids in town			0
@entity158 emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal democrats do n't want to be blamed republicans got the most blame for the october shutdown , and @entity9 want to make that a permanent association in the mind of the public			1
@entity14 minority leader @entity168 told @entity1 on thursday that the anti-government tea party wing had sullied the @entity8 brand			1
" in many ways , those people have hijacked the name @entity8 , which has been such a valuable contribution to our country , the @entity8 , " the @entity172 @entity171 said			2
" but they 've taken it over the cliff			0
" with congressional elections coming up next year , democrats want to ensure that voters think of @entity8 whenever the word shutdown comes up			2
agreeing to the budget plan avoids the possibility of another shutdown until at least 2015 , preserving the negative connotation for @entity8 through the next election cycle			1
certainty at last actually passing a formal budget for the first time in several years benefits everyone			1
@entity5 returns to what leaders call " regular order " on the budget , meaning spending proposals are debated and passed instead of the practice in recent years of merely authorizing spending at previous levels			2
bureaucrats can develop strategies and plans based on known figures , rather than wallowing in uncertainty over how much money the bickering legislators finally would authorize			0
legislators up for re-election next year can campaign on their political and fiscal philosophies and accomplishments -- such as passing a budget -- instead of engaging in spending showdowns that anger voters and hinder economic growth			0
" i came here to cut the size of government			0
that 's exactly what this bill does , " @entity49 said thursday of the budget deal			0
meanwhile , @entity168 made sure to point out that passing the budget agreement would require @entity9 votes because too many republicans oppose it for the majority party to push it through on its own			1
" they have n't passed anything with their own votes that was any good for the country , " she said			0
opinion : a budget deal that 's bad for @entity31 @entity1 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

for the first time in years , leaders agree on a full budget plan
@entity8 want to avoid another government shutdown and focus on @entity62
@entity9 can still brand @entity8 as the shutdown party *due* to october
bureaucrats , politicians and the economy benefit from the funding certainty
