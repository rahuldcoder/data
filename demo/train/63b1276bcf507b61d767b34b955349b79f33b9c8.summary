@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 summoned the @entity4 ambassador on friday to express its " strong dissatisfaction " over the @entity7 's meeting with @entity4 president @entity8 a day earlier			1
@entity1 did n't disclose what was discussed during the session with ambassador @entity11 at the @entity12			2
but @entity0 had warned that a meeting between the president and the exiled @entity16 spiritual leader would damage its ties with @entity18			2
" the @entity1 side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this meeting , " a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity12 said in a statement after thursday 's meeting at the @entity22			1
" @entity1 demands the @entity4 seriously consider @entity1 's stance , immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact , [ and ] stop conniving and supporting @entity31 separatist forces			1
" the @entity4 @entity32 did n't characterize friday 's meeting , but it provided the message @entity11 delivered to deputy foreign minister @entity35			2
" now is the time to move forward and cooperate in ways that benefit our two counties , the region and the world , " @entity11 said , according to the @entity4 embassy			0
the meeting has the potential to further complicate @entity1 - @entity4 tensions , which have been rising in recent months			1
the @entity7 has said he favors genuine autonomy for @entity16 , not independence for @entity48			2
@entity0 regards the @entity50 laureate as a separatist who wishes to sever @entity48 from @entity1			1
@entity8 's meeting with the @entity7 " runs against the repeated commitments by the @entity4 government that the @entity4 recognizes @entity48 as part of @entity1 and gives no support to ' @entity48 independence ' , " @entity54 spokesman @entity53 said			1
during the meeting , @entity8 stressed his " strong support for the preservation of @entity48 's unique religious , cultural and linguistic identity , and the protection of human rights for @entity16 , " according to a @entity22 statement			1
the president praised the @entity7 's " commitment to nonviolence and his pursuit of dialogue with the @entity1 government , " the statement added			1
he also stressed the importance of having both sides " engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences , and was pleased to hear about the recent resumption of talks , " it noted			0
the @entity7 , while acknowledging that he raised concerns about @entity48 during the meeting , did not provide further specifics about his home region 's political situation while addressing reporters			1
he said he admired @entity4 as a " champion of democracy and ... freedom , " and cited the need to promote " religious harmony " and " human value			0
" he also met with secretary of state @entity95			0
the meeting between the @entity7 and @entity8 could " seriously undermine the @entity1 - @entity4 political relations , " @entity96 , a senior @entity97 leader in charge of ethnic and religious affairs , warned recently			1
" we will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes			0
" on thursday , @entity1 's @entity12 spokesman said the meeting " grossly violated the norms governing ... international relations			2
" @entity8 did not meet with the @entity7 when the spiritual leader visited @entity18 last fall , making it the first time since 1991 that such a meeting did not occur			1
ahead of a summit with @entity1 president @entity114 , @entity8 persuaded @entity16 representatives back then to postpone the meeting with the @entity7			1
thursday 's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between @entity4 and @entity1 , including trade disputes , a recent @entity4 arm sales deal for @entity123 -- which @entity1 considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship row over internet search engine @entity126 the meeting is " another event in the recent , one has to say , downward spiral in @entity4 - @entity1 relations , " said @entity1 scholar @entity128			1
it 's also troublesome for the @entity1 for one other important reason , @entity128 said			0
" he could have met him as a spiritual leader in a neutral place like a church , " he said			0
but receiving him in the @entity22 " is a political act			0
and that is going to irritate @entity1 very much			0
" the meeting did not take place in the formal , official setting of the @entity146			0
it was instead held in the @entity148 , which is considered part of the presidential residence			0
the choice of settings was considered by many observers to be a sign of @entity18 's acknowledgment of @entity0 's political sensitivities			0
some analysts said the @entity1 government could retaliate by cutting off political exchanges as they did after the @entity7 met with the heads of state of @entity161 and @entity162			1
and @entity114 could turn down an invitation to visit @entity18 in april			0
neither @entity1 nor the @entity4 can afford strained relations , said @entity165 , a diplomat and investment banker who has served as a presidential adviser on @entity1			2
" we both need each other , " he said			0
" we need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis , to deal with the global financial crisis			0
" @entity1 is the largest growing export market for @entity4 companies , @entity165 said , expanding by 65 percent last year alone			2
nearly three - quarters of all @entity4 think that @entity48 should be an independent country , according to a new national @entity178 poll			2
but the survey , released thursday , also indicates that most @entity4 think it is more important to maintain good relations with @entity1 than to take a stand on @entity48			1
@entity2 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
