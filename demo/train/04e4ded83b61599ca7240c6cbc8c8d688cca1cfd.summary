@entity0 , @entity1 -- in his epic " letter from the @entity6 , " the rev. @entity3 observed that " justice too long delayed is justice denied			0
" but now that the @entity11 administration is fast - tracking the deportation of thousands of undocumented minors , perhaps hoping to get rid of them before the november elections , it 's clear that expedited justice is just as bad			1
some migrants who come to the @entity18 are dying to go home			1
sadly , some of these deported kids could be going home to die			1
when @entity18 first learned that as many as 60,000 unaccompanied minors from @entity25 had made their way into the @entity18 since october 2013 , and we heard the horrific stories they told about being assaulted and targeted for murder in their home countries , we had to know this story was n't going to have a happy ending			1
the @entity11 administration has said from the beginning that most of those children would have to go home			2
in order to ensure such an outcome , the administration has its thumb on the scale			0
a lawsuit claims that the system is rigged to make it all but impossible to establish the " credible fear " necessary for the kids to obtain asylum			1
despite the president 's claim that there is no rush in returning the children and due process would be preserved , the reality is much different			2
kids are given court dates they ca n't possibly be expected to make -- often in another state			1
many do n't have lawyers			0
deportation cases are being rushed through the pipeline			2
according to the @entity63 , the first bloc of deportation cases against children from @entity25 are under way in the @entity66 courts			1
immigration attorneys and immigrant advocates worry that the children wo n't have enough time to find a lawyer who can prepare an adequate defense that might allow them to stay in the @entity18			1
for @entity75 , an attorney with @entity76 , a nonprofit organization in the state that gives low - cost legal services to immigrants , justice expedited is no justice at all			0
" although the court clearly gives them this list of legal providers , i would bet 90 % are not going to find lawyers , " @entity75 told the newspaper			0
" there are not enough , and the time frame they are giving them is very rushed			0
it 's a violation of due process			0
" of course , many of these kids will never make it as far as @entity66			2
in fact , many have been quietly apprehended at the border and returned to @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100			0
last month , @entity102 gov. @entity101 , a possible contender for the @entity104 nomination in 2016 , warned that the administration was giving the migrant children death sentences			2
@entity101 told a gathering of the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity111 : " we are not a country that should turn children away and send them back to certain death			0
take it from @entity117 , who runs the morgue in the @entity99 town of @entity120 , which is one of the most violent cities in the world			0
according to an article in the @entity125 , he said that at least one child slain in @entity120 since february was deported from the @entity18			1
gang members shot at another young man deported from the @entity18 in another case reported by the @entity125 , a boy was shot and killed after leaving a deportation flight , according to his cousin			1
the article refers to " thousands " of undocumented @entity99 children who were deported by the @entity18			1
by the end of the year , there could easily be many more dead children who -- once upon a time -- managed to escape their hellish environment			0
they trekked all the way to the @entity18 , only to be captured and sent home without a hearing , without due process , without a chance			2
this is not how a great country welcomes the most vulnerable people in the world .			0
