@entity0 -- the most conservative republicans are embracing some of the same campaign strategies -- decreased federal spending , lower tax rates and repealing @entity6 -- that many say led to the party 's defeat in november			1
it may be a telling glimpse of the @entity14 leadership 's ongoing gut check			1
the message : we may have lost the presidential battle but we can still win the war of principles			2
" first , the @entity14 needs to be a conservative party with no apologies , " @entity20 , chairman of the @entity21 , said on thursday to audience applause at the @entity23			1
@entity23 is an annual event which also serves as a way to check the pulse of the political right			1
this year 's conference is being held along the banks of the @entity32 just outside @entity0 in @entity33			0
it is the same type of message @entity36 chairman and 2012 @entity14 vice presidential nominee rep. @entity39 echoed earlier in the week			1
" the election did n't go our way , " said the @entity40 @entity14 , who is slated to make an appearance at the conference this week			1
" believe me , i know what that feels like			0
that means we surrender our principles ? that means we stop believing in what we believe in ? " for the most conservative wing of the party 's faithful , the answer is a resounding " no. " such emotions are a deep undercurrent in the @entity14 's search for identity			1
that soul - searching is unfolding as party leadership braces itself for the next round of contentious budget battles and takes tentative steps toward working with a president whose very name is still a rallying cry for many in the base			2
major conservative conference comes at crucial time for @entity14 agenda topics include " reversing @entity6 and @entity75 : @entity77 " and " has @entity76 ? business in @entity80 's @entity79			1
" flying in the face of the old - time religion fervor , @entity14 face the task of wading through internal divisions as they await the @entity86 's expected release of a post-mortem " @entity90 " report that dissects why the party lost the 2012 presidential election			1
the autopsy is expected to highlight issues like beefing up @entity86 technology , voting by mail , fundraising and other campaign mechanics , as well as outreach to specific demographic groups in hopes of identifying more effective ways to attract minority and younger voters			0
the report will deal with things that can be fixed , some @entity14 strategists say			1
the core message , they say , is solid			1
it just needs better packaging			0
in this , some party faithful see @entity39 and his budget as an indication that the party is on the right path			2
@entity39 's budget shows " the @entity14 is sticking to its principles of fiscal responsibility , " said @entity117 , a veteran @entity14 strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the communications firm @entity120			1
the lessons the overall party " learned were more about the presidential candidate " and less about the broader party , he said			2
@entity126 charm offensive does not extend to @entity39 budget @entity126 officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , essentially accused @entity39 of misreading last november 's election in releasing a spending plan on tuesday that seeks to unravel much of the @entity80 domestic agenda			0
@entity39 said repealing the president 's health care law is critical to efforts to balance the budget			0
" we will never be able to balance the budget if you keep ' @entity6 ' going because ' @entity6 ' is a fiscal train wreck , " @entity39 said on tuesday			0
@entity39 's budget and a @entity143 plan by @entity145 chairman @entity144 of @entity0 , which will likely include a tax increase for the wealthy and business and some spending cuts , are seen as partisan efforts unlikely to win congressional approval			0
and that 's the problem , some @entity14 say			2
conservative positions â € ” like those championed by @entity39 on issues like trimming entitlement spending as a way of cutting the deficit -- are lost in messaging that reminds voters too much of a failed presidential platform			0
" they should have learned from the 2012 elections , and stand by the issue that the debt is the main problem			0
but the language has to be different , " said @entity168 , an economist and conservative political commentator			2
" the @entity14 has problems in communication on a number of levels			2
the way he is communicating in a ' take it or leave it ' way is not going to resonate with the @entity79 people , " @entity168 said			0
but the @entity14 needs more than a message makeover , political experts say			1
it needs a major overhaul			1
" now we know the messaging was bad			0
and we are getting to the second stage : the recalibration , " @entity1 chief political analyst @entity187 wrote recently			0
" ' think of it as a reappraisal , ' one senior @entity14 strategist told me			2
i prefer to think of it as a matter of survival			0
" @entity1 's @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
