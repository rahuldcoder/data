-- @entity2 's navy monday opened two weeks of hearings into the @entity5 sinking of the cruiser @entity7 , an effort to formally close the book on the country 's worst naval disaster			1
the gun turret of @entity7 was discovered with the rest of the vessel in march 2008			1
the ship 's entire crew of 645 died when it was sunk by the @entity20 commerce raider @entity18			0
about 15 relatives of the lost men attended monday 's opening session , said @entity24			0
@entity25 , the lawyer presenting the evidence gathered by investigators to a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge			1
" i do n't think until today -- until you actually get to hear the evidence of the impact of a bombardment of the ship and the nature of the injuries -- i think there are some pretty mixed emotions as a consequence of it , " @entity25 said			0
the inquiry could produce its report on the sinking by april , he said			0
in march , researchers discovered the @entity7 's wreckage in the @entity47 , about 207 km ( 128 miles ) off @entity2 's west coast			1
at the time it sank , searchers found only two floatation belts and an empty life raft -- and the only accounts of its november 1941 destruction came from survivors of the @entity18 , an armed cargo ship flying a false flag			2
the @entity20 ship inflicted " enormous damage " on the @entity7 during a battle that is believed to have lasted about 35 minutes and left 70 percent of its crew dead or incapacitated , @entity25 said			2
" it is likely that the captain , the navigator , all the senior officers were taken out on the first salvo , " he said			0
a torpedo tore into the @entity7 's bow , flooding the forward end of the ship , while the @entity18 fired an estimated 87 rounds from its 15 - cm ( 5.9 - inch ) guns into the @entity2 cruiser			1
the @entity7 limped away and sank sometime between two to four and a half hours later , @entity25 said			2
during the battle , however , the @entity18 was hit by an @entity2 shell that damaged its engines and set the vessel ablaze			2
with hundreds of mines aboard , its captain ordered the crew to abandon ship , fearing the fire would set those off			0
a search began only five days after the battle , when the @entity7 had failed to return to port in @entity89			0
and an 11 - day delay by @entity2 's government in announcing the ship 's loss fueled what a 1999 parliamentary report called " a proliferation of theories " about the fate of the crew -- that the ship was actually sunk by a @entity101 submarine , that survivors were machine - gunned in the water or that the government hid bodies after they washed up on the beach			1
@entity25 said some of the proponents of those theories will be allowed to present their cases to the inquiry as well			1
" we 're not hearing from everyone , but we are giving an opportunity to people to make those arguments , " he said .			0

the wreckage of @entity7 was found in march 2008 off @entity2 's western coast
