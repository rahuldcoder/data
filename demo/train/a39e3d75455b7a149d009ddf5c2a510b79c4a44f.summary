-- eyes trained straight ahead , the 16 young men are as grim - faced as pall - bearers as they carry their respective team 's boats down to the river 's edge			1
weighing on their broad shoulders is n't just a 20 - meter vessel -- it 's 184 years of tradition , six months of grueling physical training , and a fierce rivalry between two of the most prestigious universities in the world			1
welcome to the @entity17 ; 6.8 kilometers of sweat , tears , and the occasional sinking in @entity22 's @entity21			0
almost every year since 1829 , the universities ' rowing teams have battled it out in arguably the greatest -- and most controversial -- grudge matches in @entity27 's sporting history			1
" it 's the preeminent student varsity match in the world , " @entity28 , former @entity30 rower and four - time olympic gold medalist , told @entity0			1
" it 's unlike any other rowing race -- it 's a very long distance over a particularly torturous piece of river			2
" @entity30 triumph @entity30 emerged victorious in the 159th edition of the race on sunday , cruising over the finish line a length - and - a - half ahead of their rivals , under a torrent of jubilant expletives from cox @entity48			1
it was an emotional win for the team who named their boat after former cox and @entity55 silver medalist @entity53 , who died earlier this year from cancer , aged 35			1
but @entity30 , better known as the " dark blues , " due to their distinctive uniforms , still trail behind @entity61 's " light blues " in the long history of the race -- 77 to 81			1
indeed , giant billboards dotted along the riverbank screamed " which blue are you ? " to the thousands of onlookers who braved smatterings of snow to cheer on the rowers in their 17 - minute crusade from @entity74 to @entity75			0
protest , elitism and wild boar sausages there was none of the drama of last year , however , when @entity83 protester @entity81 brought the race to a standstill after plunging between the boats and narrowly avoiding the pounding oars			2
the anti-elitism campaigner served seven weeks in prison for the stunt -- though he 's admitted if the weather had been this foul in 2012 he might have been more reluctant to dive into the murky @entity21			0
freezing weather aside , the @entity95 were n't taking any chances , arming themselves with thermal imaging equipment as they patrolled the course			0
it appears that if @entity81 had hoped to discourage the stereotypical @entity104 jacket - wearing " hooray - henry " crowd , he failed miserably			0
going hand - in - hand with prestige is wealth , and the @entity17 is no exception			2
beside the traditional pubs lining the riverbank this weekend were champagne - sponsored soirees and stalls selling wild boar sausages			0
if any more proof was needed of the race 's upper - class flavor , it was surely found in the title sponsor -- global financial services firm @entity120			2
elitist ? far from it , argued @entity124 president , @entity123 , who instead called the race " the ultimate meritocracy			0
" " you get to the university on your academic merit and you make the team on your rowing merit , " he said			0
" it does n't matter who your parents are			0
" no pain , no gain regardless of its character , there 's no disputing the race 's reputation as a breeding ground for future olympians			2
it regularly attracts the best athletes from across the world -- including @entity148 competitors the @entity149 twins , who rowed for @entity30 in 2010 and are perhaps best known as the former business partners of @entity151 , who alleged that @entity151 stole the idea for @entity153 from them			0
training is a grueling commitment which begins in september , and it 's estimated that for every stroke made on race day , 600 have been made during practice			2
an average day will begin at 5am , with competitors training around five - hours - a day , seven - days - a - week			0
" it 's of the highest importance to us -- we sacrifice six months of our lives for 16 minutes , " @entity123 said			0
" i 'd say there 's definitely lots of cases where the boat race has caused many a break - up			1
" tradition rules since old school chums @entity171 , a student at @entity61 , and @entity173 , of @entity30 , first challenged each other to a rowing race in the early 19th century , the competition has gained legendary status in @entity27 , attracting millions of tv viewers each year			1
fabled stories such as the " 1877 dead heat " -- where judge " @entity180 had his view of the finish line obscured -- add to the almost mythical character of the competition			1
tradition continues to loom large in the race which begins with the toss of an 1829 gold coin and ends with throwing the winning cox into the water			1
today that strong sense of history sits happily beside state - of - the - art sports equipment and up - to - the - minute media coverage			0
and while opinion remains divided on its merit -- telegraph journalist @entity198 described the boat race as " fantastically boring " -- there 's no denying its enduring place in the nation 's history .			1

@entity206 win 159th edition of prestigious boat race against @entity61
the " dark blues " cruise over finish line one - and - a - half lengths ahead of rivals
strong *military* presence ensures there 's no repeat of last year 's anti-elitist protest
tradition and prestige loom large in @entity27 's greatest grudge match
