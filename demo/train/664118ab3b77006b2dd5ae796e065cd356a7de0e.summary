-- april 20 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17			0
it is the worst oil spill in @entity20 history , and it happened exactly one year ago			1
that story leads off this wednesday edition of @entity0			0
first up : a year later @entity23 : blowout preventer , top kill , containment dome			1
a year ago , most of us had never heard of those terms			1
but they became part of our everyday lives as we watched the oil spill in the @entity4 unfold			1
it started on april 20 , 2010 , with this explosion on the @entity36 oil rig			1
11 of the 126 workers on the rig were killed in the explosion			1
the situation got worse when officials realized that oil was leaking directly out of the well and into the @entity4			1
several early attempts to plug that leak completely failed			0
that left this : a sheen that stretched across parts of the @entity4			0
when a reporter dipped his glove into the water , as you see on your screen right there , you can see just how thick the oil was			2
two weeks after the explosion on the rig , the oil reached shore , coating miles of beaches all along the @entity20 @entity63 and having a devastating impact on local wildlife			1
eventually , engineers were able to seal the well and stop the leak , but not before more than 200 million gallons of oil got out			2
check out what @entity70 found when he journeyed back to the @entity63 one year after the spill			1
( begin video ) @entity74 , @entity75 national correspondent : @entity77 officials are watching their worst predictions come true			1
@entity80 oil spill damage to some sensitive marshes may be permanent			1
are these marshes done for ? @entity83 , coastal protection and restoration : this area is likely going to be open water in a few years			0
@entity88 : this is what this 40 - acre section of marsh looked like when the oil hit last may			2
the syrupy crude i saw floating on the water then was just the beginning of the problem			0
@entity99 : it 's wiped out the birds that used to be here			2
it 's wiped out the fish , the shellfish , everything in this area			2
@entity88 : returning 10 months later , the @entity77 governor 's office gave me an exclusive and disturbing look inside this damaged ecosystem			2
i could still see oil everywhere , sticking to the plants			2
it 's also saturated the fragile soil			2
you can find it a foot below the surface			0
yes , it 's down into the roots			2
it 's like a paste			2
and @entity77 officials still look at all this oily black and see red			0
this confrontation was in december as parish president @entity131 accused the @entity132 of not doing enough to speed the clean up			0
after months of study , the @entity132 now tells me digging out the oil in some areas will do more harm than good			2
@entity139 , @entity132 : you can actually go in , you can trample oil into the marsh , where it would make it even worse than what it would have been if you would have just left it alone			2
@entity88 : but letting nature take its course could mean watching more of these vanishing marshes wash away			0
@entity99 : we 're losing and trying to prevent the loss of ... @entity88 : wait a minute			0
do you know what i smell ? it smells like freshly poured asphalt			0
@entity88 : and there 's fear that the oil we see in the marshes is only a fraction of what 's here			1
there 's oil underwater , too			1
this is how most people find submerged oil out here			2
it looks clean right now , but not for long			0
watch what happens as a couple of quick spins from our airboat churns up the sediment below and releases the hidden oil			2
that 's not mud we 're looking at , is it ? within seconds , a telltale sheen begins to form , a reminder that the losses suffered in this spill are far from over			1
so , as long as this oil is here , it 's just going to keep killing anything that tries to live here			1
@entity99 : it 's going to keep killing , and you 're going to have the birds who are going to come back and get re-oiled and they 'll go fly somewhere else			1
and so , yes , the impacts are going to continue			0
@entity88 : and that , officials say , could go on for decades			0
( @entity198 ) @entity199 @entity23 : this day in history also marks the anniversary of a tragic event that took place in @entity5 , @entity6			0
on april 20 , 1999 , a shooting happened at @entity205			0
13 people were killed ; 23 others were wounded			0
the two shooters eventually killed themselves as well			0
the attack shocked the country			0
former president @entity211 described it as " a day that changed us forever			0
" this memorial to the victims of the shooting was unveiled at a park near @entity205 in 2007			0
just the facts @entity220 , @entity15 : just the facts ! the war in @entity7 started in 2001 following the september 11th terrorist attacks on the @entity20 a @entity20 - led coalition removed @entity7 's @entity226 leaders from power			1
@entity226 fighters eventually regrouped and are battling coalition forces to this day			1
there are currently around 100,000 @entity20 troops serving in @entity7			1
threat of insurgents @entity23 : the @entity20 is scheduled to start pulling some of those troops out of @entity7 later this year			1
but defense secretary @entity235 has said that the pace of the withdrawal will depend on the conditions in @entity7			1
right now , coalition forces are facing a new threat in their fight against the @entity226			1
( begin video ) @entity244 , @entity75 pentagon correspondent : @entity20 and @entity7 forces in the remote mountains of eastern @entity7			1
six @entity20 troops lost their lives here trying to dislodge the @entity226 and protect local citizens			0
but it 's the threat of insurgents wearing @entity7 uniforms and attacking once secure areas that is increasingly worrisome			1
former @entity7 war commander , retired lieutenant general @entity254 , says the @entity226 are getting ready for a @entity20 withdrawal			1
@entity256 @entity254 , @entity257 ( @entity258 ) : their approach is not only to try and find ways to get inside the wire , as it were , to kill @entity20 , but also to suddenly undermine psychologically @entity20 confidence in their @entity7 counterparts			1
@entity266 : on monday , a man wearing an @entity7 army uniform entered the secure compound of the @entity270 and opened fire , killing two			1
five @entity20 soldiers were killed saturday when a suicide bomber wearing an @entity7 military uniform struck a military base			1
on friday , the @entity277 police chief was killed by a suicide bomber wearing a military uniform			0
@entity20 military officials say civilians still suffer most from the suicide attacks			0
in february and march of 2010 , insurgents killed or injured 82 @entity7 civilians			1
this year it was 353 , a 330 % jump			2
but @entity254 warns @entity20 troops should n't feel too secure			0
@entity287 : we have felt in the past if we were inside of our bases and if we were working with our @entity7 counterparts , that we were relatively secure			1
and i think that this whole strategy now puts that into question			0
@entity266 : the @entity20 military is now training @entity7 units in basic counterintelligence so they can try to find infiltrators in army and police units before they attack			1
@entity242 , @entity75 , the @entity302			1
( @entity198 ) @entity303 @entity304 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! the word " volunteer " can be traced back to what language ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity316 , b ) @entity314 , c ) @entity317 or @entity318 ) @entity319 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! we 'll volunteer that the correct answer is latin			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! volunteer month @entity23 : april is volunteer month , a time when many @entity20 help others out without asking for a thing in return			1

more than 60 people took part in the races			0
