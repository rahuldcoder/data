-- " i want to be frozen on the hope that they 'll find whatever i died of and bring me back , " @entity0 told a shocked group of dinner guests gathered at his @entity8 home for a party hosted by him and his wife , @entity13			1
" @entity14 : a @entity15 : dinner with the @entity17 " airs at 8 p.m. et sunday			0
no topic was off - limits when @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 discussed friendship , insecurities , success , worries , life , death and nearly everything in between			1
@entity34 asked the @entity1 host whether he was " maybe a little obsessed with your own mortality , like i am ? " " oh , i fear death , " @entity0 told the " @entity39 " creator			1
" my biggest fear is death , because i do n't think i 'm going anywhere			1
and since i do n't think that , and i do n't have a belief ... i 'm married to someone who has the belief , so she knows she 's going somewhere			1
" although mortality was a topic of discussion , the dinner party was far from macabre			0
not only did @entity54 funnyman brand rummage through @entity13 's underwear drawer ( on camera , no less ) , the multicourse meal was prepared by @entity57			2
" this is big news , " @entity20 said			1
" you would like to be frozen ? this is news to me			0
" " it 's the only hedging of a bet , " answered @entity0			1
the comedian and host of @entity66 's ( sister station to @entity1 ) " @entity67 , " still in shock , told the group , " i just want to make sure that we stick with the headline here , which is that you wish to be frozen			2
" @entity34 wondered aloud whether @entity0 wished to live forever			1
" yeah , you bet your ass , " @entity0 said			1
" here 's the thing , " @entity20 continued			1
. " you just revealed that you want to be frozen ... " " why you hung on that ? " asked @entity0			1
" listen , two things just happened , " @entity20 joked			1
" you revealed you want your head chopped off and frozen , and @entity26 went into your wife 's room and stole your underwear			2
and now you 're moving on with your prepared questions			0
" when the subject turned to friendship , @entity0 told the group that he had an " unusual situation " because he remains friends with three individuals he 's known since the age of 10			1
" well , these are people you fought in the @entity92 with , @entity0 , " joked @entity20			1
" that 's a bond			2
when you 're fighting the @entity95 , that 's an incredible bond , @entity0			1
" @entity22 told party guests that his mother is his best friend			0
" we started out together in @entity100 , @entity101 , " explained the basketball great			0
" and throughout all the tough times , she was there			0
she was really my real role model			0
my mother 's always been there for me			2
she 's my best friend			2
before i do something or say something crazy , i always think about how it could affect her			0
" @entity34 had similar sentiments			0
" both my parents were unbelievably supportive , " he said			0
" they were ex-hippies and so , thank @entity115 , never wanted me to become a lawyer or anything like that			0
my mom used to call every monday morning after ' @entity39 ' would air , and either rave about the show or say , ' eh , i did n't think this was as funny as some of the other ones			2
' and i would always look forward to that call			0
" @entity34 lost his mother last year after a battle with cancer			0
@entity20 opened up about the insecurities within him that plague him to this day			1
he talked about a group of inner - city kids who came to visit the " @entity67 " set			0
" one of the girls -- she must have been 16 , 17 years old -- said to me , ' how do you get over your insecurity ? when does that go away ? ' and i said , ' you never get over it			0
' and she was shocked			0
" @entity25 also chimed in on insecurities and success			0
" the prime rule back in the ' 40s was , you have to be humble with your creativity and gracious with your success			0
we did n't think about money or fame ever			2
" @entity0 asked @entity150 inventor @entity24 what makes him angry			1
" inaction , " answered @entity24			0
" people seeing something just inhumane going wrong and just not doing anything about it			2
" @entity0 asked banks what people 's biggest misunderstanding is about her			1
" when i created my show , " said the fashion and beauty guru , " i also created a persona on ' @entity164 , ' and it 's a character			1
... that is a character			2
i do n't do that			2
" @entity34 told the group , " i think people , because of ' @entity39 ' , think that i 'm a heartless frat guy , playboy type			1
could not be further from the truth , i 'm actually very shy			2
i fall asleep each night with a book in my hands			0
my favorite movie is ' @entity176			1
' " as dinner wrapped up , @entity0 asked his guests what they were most grateful for			1

" i hope people enjoy it , " @entity0 said			1
" i hope that enough people like it that we do it on a regular basis			2
i 've done a lot of things in my life and this was one of the big kicks			0
i think it 's a great idea and i think that it works			2
" @entity0 also opened up about some misconceptions about himself			1
" people sometimes think i 'm sort of all - knowing , " he explained			1
" when you reach a certain age and people see you on television , they look at you and think , ' wow ! everything must be great ! ' well , everything is n't always great			1
you can be hailed on the streetcorner , but you still have to go home and take out the garbage			0
you have one kid who does n't want to go to school , another has an earache			2
... " here 's an example : my wife is late getting somewhere			0
one kid is yelling , another kid is out on his bike , and he has n't come home , and i 'm out in front of the house looking for him , and a tour bus goes by			1
so i got ta stop and smile and wave at a tour bus			0
it 's like leading two lives , and it 's crazy			0
