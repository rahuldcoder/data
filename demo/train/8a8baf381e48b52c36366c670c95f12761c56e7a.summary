-- before my parents left @entity4 in 1967 , they were given a gift box full of @entity6 : a collection of the greatest @entity9 cast recordings of all time , lovingly pressed into 50 sleek disks of vinyl			2
for over a decade , the contents of the box were the only music played in our home			0
my sister and i came of age listening to @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity23			0
and when we were finally ushered into the dark of an actual @entity9 playhouse to experience firsthand the unique alchemy that occurs when music and theater meet , we were hooked for life			0
all of this is just to explain why i 'm conflicted by the controversy that 's erupted over the recent revival of @entity33 and @entity35 's comic operetta " @entity36 , " which is being presented in celebration of the 60th anniversary of @entity40 's @entity39 , one of the oldest light opera companies in the nation			1
it 's hardly surprising that the @entity45 would choose " @entity36 " for its diamond jubilee year			1
it is the most frequently staged of @entity49 's operettas and a perennial favorite of the @entity45			0
every time , they have done it the same way : as a photocopy of the @entity56 original , with @entity58 actors wearing garish facepaint and outfits that cartoonishly approximate traditional @entity62 garb			0
there 's a term for this kind of racial costuming : @entity67			1
it 's a phenomenon that seems to be resurgent			2
we saw it in @entity72 's geisha - inspired performance at the @entity73 in november , in a january episode of the hit sitcom " @entity79 " and a month later , in the opening sketch of the venerable comedy program " @entity78			2
" each time , the use of yellowface has been defended as loving homage or harmless parody			0
each time , when @entity84 - @entity6 have pointed out that we do n't find the wearing of cosmetics and wardrobe to simulate @entity84 appearance to be " loving " or " harmless , " our concerns have been dismissed			1
which is why , despite my deep personal love of musical theater , i think these " traditional " productions -- yellowface productions -- of " @entity36 " have to end			1
they are the deep - drilled root of the yellowface weed : the place from which the scourge keeps springing back , even when its surface expressions are plucked			2
there are older examples of yellowface in entertainment than " @entity36 , " but none so popular , and certainly none that have been as popular among mass audiences for as long -- 129 years and counting			1
i want to be clear that i 'm not saying that " @entity36 " should n't be performed at all			1
its biting satire and splendidly silly stage play make it quite possibly @entity49 's greatest work			0
but when it is performed by an all - white troupe of actors dressed and made up as @entity116 , it shifts from a brilliant comedy of manners to , as @entity84 - @entity6 actress and blogger @entity119 says , a " racist piece of crap			1
" @entity119 , a musical theater veteran and original cast member of the bawdy @entity125 hit " @entity126 , " is actually quoting herself			0
that 's the first line spoken by @entity128 , the character she plays in the indie film " @entity131 , " a mockumentary that follows an asian - american theater troupe forced to put on a production of " @entity36 " in order to stave off bankruptcy			1
" in the movie , the artistic director makes a desperate attempt to convince us that it wo n't look like yellowface , because underneath the costumes and makeup , it 's @entity116 playing @entity116 -- or at least the @entity116 white people think we are , " says @entity119 , who also co-wrote the screenplay			1
" obviously , the company is not down for it			0
" by demonstrating that @entity116 ca n't present a " traditional " version of the show without looking and feeling ridiculous , the film aptly exposes the uncomfortable racial reality behind operetta 's fanciful farce			1
but it then goes on to show how little it takes to make a version of " @entity36 " that is n't offensive : a commitment to multiethnic casting and an end to the use of makeup to ape " exotic " @entity84 features			1
and while we 're at it , maybe change the cast names to something that do n't sound like schoolyard slurs ? there 's no reason why @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 could n't be @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , all names that @entity62 humans might actually be called			1
hardcore fans find the suggestion of any kind of alteration of @entity49 's works to be anathema			0
but live theater is unsettled and organic by nature			0
no two performances are the same , and shows are revived time and again , with each new production adding contexts that enhance rather than erase the original			0
indeed , " @entity36 " has seen the wildest set of adaptations of all of @entity49 's works			1
1939 saw the first staging of " @entity196 , " a jazzed - up edition of the opera featuring an all - black cast , which has since itself been revived dozens of times			2
in 1987 , @entity202 member @entity201 headlined a much - celebrated version of " @entity36 " for @entity205 television , which was traditional in all respects , except for resetting the antics at an @entity209 seaside resort			2
even " traditional " productions embrace mutability and modernity			0
the song " i have a @entity215 , " sung by @entity214 , details a lengthy set of individuals who " never would be missed " if they were to encounter the business end of a chopper			0
every " @entity36 " production customizes the lyrics of the song , rewriting them to lampoon present - day celebrities and situations			1
if @entity171 can sing about @entity225 and customer service operators , there is n't any reason why the rest of the play ca n't be updated as well			0
a hundred and thirty years ago , @entity230 was exotic and alien and strange ; today , sushi is sold in @entity234 ( now a @entity62 - owned chain ! ) and there are 18 million @entity6 who trace our ancestry to that continent , but keep our homes and hearts right here			0
is n't it time to lower the curtain on yellowface for good ?			2

to celebrate 60th anniversary of @entity40 's @entity39 , " @entity36 " is shown
@entity248 : yellowface productions of " @entity36 " have to end
he says an all - white cast of @entity84 characters in cartoonish costumes is offensive
@entity248 : racial costuming seems to be resurgent ; we do n't need it in this day and age
