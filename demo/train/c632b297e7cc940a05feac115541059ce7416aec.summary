it is some admission from one of the finest golfers ever to play the game			1
@entity5 -- a 14 - time major champion and former world no. 1 -- is taking a break from the sport after admitting his game is n't up to scratch			1
the 39 - year - old shot a career worst round of 82 at his first tournament of 2015 in @entity14 before withdrawing from his second at @entity16 due to injury			1
and he says he wo n't be back until both his body , and his game , are in tip top shape			0
" this latest injury is not related to my previous surgery			1
i am having daily physical therapy and i am feeling better every day , " @entity5 said in a statement on his official website			2
" right now , i need a lot of work on my game , and to still spend time with the people that are important to me			0
my play , and scores , are not acceptable for tournament golf			1
" like i 've said , i enter a tournament to compete at the highest level , and when i think i 'm ready , i 'll be back			1
next week i will practice at medalist and at home getting ready for the rest of the year			0
" after his 2014 was blighted by a series of injuries , @entity5 ' world ranking now stands at 62 -- the lowest since he turned professional back in 1996			2
his first appearance of the year at the @entity44 saw him miss the cut by 12 shots after shooting a second round of 82 , the worst of his career			0
and he lasted just 11 holes at the @entity50 at @entity16 before pulling out due to difficulties with his back			2
it raises further questions as to whether @entity5 will ever be able to recapture the form that saw him snare 14 major titles during a glittering spell between 1997 and 2008			2
despite a clutch of top five finishes since winning the @entity60 in 2008 , @entity5 missed two majors last year and recorded a best finish of 69th in the @entity63			2
he stated his desire to feature at the @entity65 , that starts in @entity66 on february 26 , but says he will only play if his game is up to it			1
" the last two weeks have been very disappointing to me , especially @entity69 , because i never want to withdraw , " he added			0
" unfortunately , lately injuries have made that happen too often			0
i am committed to getting back to the pinnacle of my game			0
" i 'd like to play the @entity65 -- it 's a tournament in my hometown and it 's important to me -- but i wo n't be there unless my game is tournament - ready			1
" that 's not fair to anyone			0
i do , however , expect to be playing again very soon			0
