-- what do aluminum sheeting and life insurance have in common ? very little unless you 're @entity5 , industrialist and ceo of @entity7 , the @entity8 conglomerate with companies that produce the metal for car manufacturers and the insurance for those who will drive them , as well as a raft of other commodities , products and services			1
at 43 , @entity5 is one of @entity8 's richest men , inheriting control of the company in 1995 that was founded by his father , and has increased the overall turnover from $ 2 billion to $ 29 billion by 2010			1
@entity5 hopes to more than double that figure by 2015			1
" i know that sounds audacious but to put it in context , we were a little under $ 10 billion four years ago , " he says			2
" so we have a track record of doing audacious things			0
i generally believe that the quality of your future is entirely dependent on the quality of your imagination			0
" running a company is in @entity5 's blood --- the family business itself goes back four generations - but he admits that when it was his turn to become chairman after the unexpected death of his father , it was a trying time			1
" ( it ) was a very difficult time , emotionally ... i was pretty much in a fishbowl , as you can imagine			0
i was only 28 , limited experience but a lot of exposure , high quality exposure , to the world of business			2
the only thought in my mind was to carry forward his work			0
i decided that i would just put my head down and hang in there and just keep at it			0
" apart from a family tradition of being business - minded , @entity5 has continued the legacy of largesse as @entity64 give 3 % of its net profits to charity			1
" it is this whole philosophy of trusteeship , of plying back part of your profits in terms of giving back to society			0
so the social arm ... is run with the same rigor and intensity and precision as our businesses are			0
essentially we work out of 3,000 villages and the work that we do touches about 7 million people every year			0
" while he continued family traditions in the company , @entity5 has displayed a keen eye when it comes to acquisitions , overseeing the purchase of 20 companies across the world , boosting revenues and , he hopes , @entity8 's image as an emerging business heavyweight abroad			1
" i think the @entity8 story is now much better known the world over , i think @entity8 as a nation is far more respected , " he says			2
" it 's gained the respect of people as an intellectual powerhouse , as a serious business destination , as people who are a very enterprising lot			2
i think it 's the sheer spirit of enterprise that @entity8 bring to the table			1
