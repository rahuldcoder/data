-- you could say that @entity2 is on top of his game			0
for almost a decade , the 30 - year - old has scaled the peaks of competitive free - climbing , becoming one of the most successful boulderers the sport has ever known with five overall @entity13 titles to his name			1
bouldering -- the sport of climbing small rocks or boulders without ropes or harnesses -- combines athletic agility with incredible strength , which are two qualities the @entity24 has in abundance			1
" as a professional you need to be really focused and train really hard , " @entity26 told @entity0 's human to @entity28			1
" i think the thing that makes my climbing unique is that i 'm really diverse			0
" i 'm really strong in different areas of climbing whether it 's steep or flat , or long or short climbs			1
i 'm a very powerful and dynamic climber , so this helps me to combine all the skills of the different areas of climbing			2
" born in @entity37 an der ybbs , @entity26 began climbing at the age of 11 , honing his skills on indoor walls before moving outside to climb on rocks			2
he turned pro by the time he 'd reached his late teens , and in 2005 he clinched his first @entity13 title aged just 22			1
@entity47 , bouldering was used solely for practice by climbers preparing for bigger climbs , but the rise in popularity of indoor climbing centers in recent decades has seen it morph into a sport			1
in 1998 , it officially became a new climbing discipline , and the following year the @entity57 held the first @entity13			1
this year , the competition was contested over eight meetings held around the globe , with competitors battling it out on a variety of artificial climbing walls with crash mats below			2
the winner is the climber who can conquer the most boulders in the fewest attempts			1
" in competing , it 's a lot about knowing what other people did and knowing you have to better them ... and that makes it really difficult , " @entity26 says			1
" it 's both mental and physical , but it depends on the situation			2
it can be very mental and not physical at all , but usually it 's a combination			2
" @entity26 has successfully mastered both over the last decade , recording a top - three finish in nine of the last 10 years			2
and while he did n't win the overall title this year , he made up for it by chalking up his first win at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 in september			0
" next season , i 'm going to try to win the @entity89 , which i have n't achieved yet ... that 's one of my goals			2
and besides that , i want to climb hard stuff ... to push my limits , " he says			2
away from the competition walls , @entity26 has already completed some of the toughest outdoor climbs			2
in 2006 , he became one of only a handful of climbers to successfully scale @entity101 -- a famously difficult , 15 - meter high rock in @entity103 , @entity104 -- and in 2009 , @entity26 showed he was no slouch at longer climbs either , completing a 250 - meter alpine ascent of " the @entity110 " route in @entity24 's @entity109 region			1
" wherever i am , i always look out for rock faces			0
it would be good to discover something new , to go to places no - one has ever climbed before			0
i find myself on the @entity116 looking for places to climb			0
" a recent trip to @entity120 uncovered " some great rock faces and great places to develop climbing , " he says , and from a personal perspective , he 's keen to one day grapple with the mighty @entity122 , the 900 feet ( 275 meters ) granite monolith in @entity124 , @entity125			0
but his heart , along with his fingers , remains firmly wedded to @entity132 's crags and cliffs , not least those flanking the @entity136 and @entity137 valleys near his home in @entity139			1
it 's a place where he can mix sport and pleasure , he says , picking routes that are sometimes really hard but also beautiful			1
" it 's not just the difficulty , it 's also the aesthetics -- that it 's a really nice climb makes it fun to do			1
it 's a nice mix. " @entity26 climbs the 100 - meter cliff with the assistance of ropes , a harness and bolts anchored in the rock and a climbing partner called a belayer who controls the amount of friction on the rope			1
" in sport climbing , or free climbing , you have a partner who belays you with a rope			0
bolts are usually pre-placed -- drilled in , so really safe -- and you climb without resting or falling into the ropes			1
that 's the objective ... it 's usually a long process but it gives you a great feeling of satisfaction , " @entity26 says			0
" there are situations when you are afraid -- for example , if you are really high above the last belay place , the last bolt -- but usually climbing and bouldering is not too dangerous			0
" sometimes it 's difficult mentally , when you work on a route and you 're not sure if it 's possible			1
you put a lot of effort into it and learn later it 's not possible , that 's a big drawback , but you need to stay positive and have fun			0
it 's just a really cool feeling to be up there alone			0
" solitude at the top of a cliff is replaced by companionship when he gets back down			0
more often he 's met by his girlfriend and fellow free climber @entity200			1
the 25 - year - old , a four - time overall @entity13 winner and double world champion has the knack of keeping @entity26 emotionally grounded while pushing him towards new career highs			1
" all my travels and competitions and places i go , i spend time with her			0
with @entity200 , it 's funny , she is successful			0
she has more titles than me and competing with her helps me a lot ... when we rock climb it 's really inspiring			2
we can really push each other , " he says			0
" i still want to achieve harder climbs , longer climbs , some good places and results in competing			0
" i think it 's an old expression but when you die you do n't want to look back at your life and think you have n't lived			0
so it 's important what we do while we 're alive			0
