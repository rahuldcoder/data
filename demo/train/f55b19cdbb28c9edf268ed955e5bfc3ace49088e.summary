@entity0 -- the 1997 murder of @entity3 , the rapper also known as the @entity3 and @entity3 , remains an unsolved crime despite @entity0 police and @entity7 investigations that lasted for years			1
the @entity7 , which joined the case five years after the shooting , opened up its files this week by publishing hundreds of pages of investigation reports and notes from its probe on the agencies website			1
readers get a behind - the - scenes look at the @entity7 and @entity20 's work , but the documents are heavily redacted , hiding the names of sources , investigators and suspects			1
the drive - by shooting , in front of dozens of witnesses who were leaving a music industry party in @entity0 on march 9 , 1997 , spurred several conspiracy theories , but no arrests			1
@entity3 , 24 , was killed six months after his former friend and rap rival @entity34 was gunned down on a @entity36 street , causing suspicion that both shootings were part of an " @entity39 versus @entity40 " hip hop war			2
@entity34 recorded for @entity43 's @entity0 - based @entity42 , while @entity3 was signed with @entity45 - based @entity44 , founded by @entity46			1
the @entity7 opened its case in december 2002 because of " multiple source information " that @entity3 was killed " in retaliation for the murder of @entity34 " and that a rogue @entity20 officer was involved , an @entity7 report said			1
the @entity7 's case was closed in january 2005 when the @entity54 in @entity0 decided there was enough evidence for indictments in the case , according to one letter in the files			1
the files include a @entity63 newspaper story that suggested the @entity7 was pressured by the city of @entity0 to drop its probe after the lead @entity7 investigator was named as a witness in a $ 400 million lawsuit @entity3 ' mother filed against the city			1
@entity3 ' mother and his estate claimed that an @entity20 officer , who was later convicted of bank robbery , was involved and that the police department was ignoring evidence			1
the lawsuit was later dismissed			0
the newly - published documents , despite the redactions , do indicate tension between the @entity7 and @entity20			1
near the end of the @entity7 probe , the lead agent writes that he had been ordered to have no contact with the civil lawyers for the @entity3 family			2
the agent notes in one report that he would not contact a certain source " because he / she is one of the main witnesses " in the civil suit against the @entity20			2
retired @entity0 police detective @entity93 , who worked on the @entity96 ' case , told @entity1 earlier this year that he believes @entity43 was behind the murder , even though the @entity42 ' boss was serving time on a probation violation at the time			2
" @entity43 ordered the hit , " @entity93 says , adding that he believes it was arranged by @entity102 , who headed security for @entity42			0
@entity93 goes even further , stating that he believes @entity43 was behind the shooting of @entity34 as well			0
@entity93 says @entity34 's bodyguards told him that the rapper planned to sever ties with @entity43 's @entity42 which could have cost the company millions of dollars			2
" that theory does n't even add up , " says @entity110 , who wrote " @entity113 , " noting that @entity43 was sitting in the driver 's seat next to the rapper			0
" open fire on my car , but try not to hit me ? " @entity102 told @entity1 he had nothing to do with either murder , and @entity43 has repeatedly said he had nothing to do with the crime			0
but two months after @entity34 's killing , @entity43 talked to @entity122 and one quote seems to follow the former record company executive : " if you knew who killed @entity34 , would you tell police ? " to which @entity43 responded : " absolutely not			0
it 's not my job			0
i do n't get paid to solve homicides			0
i do n't get paid to tell on people			0
" @entity1 's @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report			0
