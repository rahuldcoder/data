-- actor - director @entity1 has touched the lives of thousands of @entity4 service members			1
@entity1 often travels overseas to honor and entertain the troops with his lt. @entity6 , and his @entity8 helps support them when they return home			1
@entity0 's @entity10 recently spoke with @entity1 about @entity11 and his philanthropy , which also assists civilian first responders			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity10 : what is the @entity8 ? @entity1 : over the past 10 or so years , i have been very active with a lot of military charities , a lot of first - responder charities			1
... it became clear that , in order for me to continue at the pace that i 'm at without having to travel all the time , i needed an entity that i could use to draw in funds and point people in the right direction with regard to military and first - responder support			1
@entity33 : why is this cause important to you ? @entity1 : i have veterans in my family			1
on my wife 's side , i have @entity41 veterans			1
i remember all too well what happened to them when they came home from war			0
on my side , i have veterans			2
my dad was in the @entity51 , my uncles were in @entity52 , and my grandfather served in @entity54 i have great respect for our veterans			2
and then i played one in " @entity59 " and i got involved with the @entity60 organization , and i became keenly aware of what people who lose their limbs and parts of their body have sacrificed in service of their country			2
so i feel it 's important to keep them strong and do what i can to let them know that i 'm a grateful @entity4 for what they provide , which is freedom for me and my children			1
@entity33 : how did the @entity6 get started ? @entity1 : i started taking a group of musicians with me to visit our troops in 2004			1
prior to that , i would just go out and shake hands and take pictures and sign autographs and just pat them on the back and say " thank you " and sit down to have dinner with them -- just let them know they were appreciated			0
and eventually i asked the @entity91 if they would let me take a group of musicians so i could entertain the troops at the same time , and they said " sure			2
" i happened to have these guys that i played with out of @entity96			0
and my buddy @entity97 and i put some more guys and gals together , and we have a band of 13 people now			0
it 's a big , big show			2
we 've been all over the world several times			0
we probably will do 14 , 15 @entity91 shows this year alone			0
it 's a good feeling to see the smiles on these people 's faces			0
when i go over to @entity110 , for example , and you 're out there in the war zone and you bring those people together and you play for them , it 's a great feeling to see them having a great time			0
@entity33 : what was it about @entity11 that made you want to be a part of it ? @entity1 : it 's highlighting average @entity4 and what they do on a daily basis to serve and to give back			1
i 'm glad @entity0 has created the @entity11 project , because it 's something that makes you feel good when you see what can be done and what people are doing out there in the shadows			2
a lot of people do n't know the extraordinary sacrifice and service of certain people			0
and when these kinds of things are highlighted through a campaign like this , i think it gives incentive to other people : " hey , wait a minute			0
there are things i can do in my community , even if it 's small			0
" @entity1 and his band 's efforts to support the troops are chronicled in the documentary " lt. @entity6 : for the @entity154			1
