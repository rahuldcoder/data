-- news footage of @entity3 sales , in which shoppers line up after @entity5 in search of steeply reduced merchandise , can resemble an episode of the classic nature show " @entity10			1
" shoppers wind neatly along the edges of big box stores like patiently waiting army ants			1
as doors open , sleep - deprived bargain hunters leap past one another like spawning salmon flinging themselves upstream			2
at close of business we see bare , dangling store shelves , reminiscent of the gnawed carcasses left behind by a pride of lions			2
to those who do n't participate , @entity3 may seem like madness , an exercise in chaos to be avoided at all costs			1
but for the initiated , the country 's biggest shopping day is something more : a jump start on @entity35 shopping and even a ritual worth preserving			2
it 's impossible not to marvel at the spectacle			0
@entity0 readers shared their own dramatic stories about the annual event in the comments section of a recent article			0
" at about 10 p.m. @entity5 2011 , someone sat their @entity45 at a bin in the aisle at @entity48 with her hand on a dvd discounted from $ 19 to $ 5 until the clock struck midnight to make sure she got it , " reader @entity43 remembered			1
" people started disregarding the etiquette and just stashing items in their jackets instead of leaving them in the shrink - wrapped displays			0
people were shoving and screaming at each other , " he wrote			0
" a woman was brought to the front and kicked out for bringing a firearm into the store and brandishing it at a rival shopper			0
it was the grandma hoping to score the $ 5 dvd			0
" @entity3 : shorter lines , but bigger checks so what 's the draw of risking life and limb for discounted dvds ? " it feels like some kind of communal shopping experience , something we 're all in together , " said @entity76 , a friend of mine from college who has been braving the @entity3 crowds for a decade			1
he usually only makes four or five purchases on @entity3 , spending around $ 400			1
it 's worth the effort , he said , to " soak up the mad capitalist consumer energy of @entity3 ! " " it 's pretty exciting to see people shopping like crazy , " @entity76 said , " even if my enthusiasm gets dampened by the long lines and occasional surly shopper			1
" for some , the retail spree is a family tradition			2
" i started @entity3 shopping with my @entity97 , " @entity76 said			1
at first , they shopped for equipment and supplies for @entity76 's it consulting business because of 40 % to 50 % savings			0
that was 10 years ago			0
now 41 and a father , @entity76 's @entity3 shopping strategy has branched out to include deals on toys for his son			1
this year 's @entity3 will be a lot different , he said , since his father passed away in march			1
" i 'll definitely have breakfast at the @entity111 when i 'm done , which is what we always did , " he said			0
@entity115 , 31 , also shops on @entity3 because of family tradition			1
" the first memory i have of @entity3 shopping is from when i was about 6 or 7 years old , " she said			1
" my mom , grandma and i went to a large department store in @entity123			0
i have been every year since then			0
" this year , her husband will join in the tradition , but the couple 's daughter still has a few years to go before she can drink coffee and stay up all night for long lines and " doorbusters			1
" now that @entity115 and her mother live in different states , they ca n't always shop together			1
" i always call her when i 'm headed out , " she said			0
" i 've become her wake - up call , usually around 2 a.m. " for @entity137 , a health policy analyst for the @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity3 is n't about family , but about the thrill of the bargain hunt			1
" i tried to make it a family tradition , " she said , " but my family members dropped out after one time			2
they could n't hang with me , they did n't have the stamina			2
" these @entity3 veterans acknowledge that some of their fellow shoppers turn into ruthless retail competitors mere hours after giving thanks during a dinner of turkey and pumpkin pie			1
" i 've been hit with a shopping cart , had people take things out of my cart , had people start fighting in line , had someone take something out of my hands before , " @entity115 said			2
but often , the shopping means meeting new people , comparing lists and having fun			2
" my experience has been that most people are helpful , patient and excited , " @entity76 said			0
" that may be particular to the @entity174 , but i do n't think so			2
" @entity115 and her mother even charmed a particularly long line into singing @entity35 carols last year			2
" my mom found one of those weird singing @entity35 tree tats and wore it in line , " she said			0
" the tree lit up and danced while she sang at the top of her lungs			0
of course , that story preceded us to the next store on our list , where total strangers were talking about it			0
" @entity192 : confessions of a @entity3 shopaholic " i have learned over the years that you need to pack your patience and a sense of humor , " when headed out on a @entity3 shopping trip , @entity195 said			1
" if you do n't have either , you are in for a miserable experience			2
" impatience can result in stampedes or fights , which retailers are taking steps to avoid this year			0
@entity48 , for example , is offering guarantee cards , which allow shoppers to get @entity211 , lcd tvs and blu - ray players at @entity3 prices before they get their hands on the items			1
shoppers will get the items before @entity35 , so sellouts are theoretically no longer a reason for crowds to lose their cool			0
the @entity221 @entity224 's @entity223 group has issued @entity3 safety guidelines for retailers to avoid injury during the start of the holiday shopping season			1
and stores across the country are working with local law enforcement help to keep crowds safe and shopping			2
the @entity234 estimates 147 million people will venture out this friday , saturday and sunday to take advantage of holiday sales			0
president @entity238 said in a recent press release , " though the @entity3 tradition is here to stay , there 's no question that it has changed in recent years			1
" no longer do shoppers wait to find out @entity3 promotions in the @entity246 morning paper , he said			1
now companies provide information through social media , mobile apps and specialized websites			0
@entity115 usually begins watching for @entity3 information online in mid-october			1
@entity253 is a favorite of hers -- the site offers @entity3 ads and cash back on certain purchases -- but she wo n't forgo in - store shopping for online cyber monday deals			1
she prefers the in - person rush			0
a few years ago , with a large outlet mall as her target , @entity115 and her mother could not find a parking spot at 10 p.m. on @entity5 night			1
so they drove out of the parking lot and found a hotel parking lot behind the mall where they could leave their car			0
" the mall was at the top of a hill , so we started hiking , literally , " @entity115 said			0
at the top of the hill , they were suddenly faced with the town 's drainage ditch			0
in order to make it to the coach store , which was offering everything at 50 % off , " we had to climb down the drainage wall and back up the other side , " she said			0
" we laughed our way through our desperation and got to the mall			0
" and at 5 a.m. , loaded down with bags full of @entity3 loot , she and her mother climbed back up the stone drainage wall on hands and knees			1

the communal aspect of @entity3 shopping can often *outweigh* the hassle
many families have turned @entity3 into a @entity5 tradition
if you ca n't wait in long lines or shop patiently , @entity3 veterans advise : do n't go !
