the 40 - minute raid early monday in @entity1 left @entity14 dead , along with four others in the complex that sits on a mountainous region near the capital			1
@entity14 was not armed during the raid , but he put up resistance when @entity4 forces entered the compound , the @entity19 said			1
officials had earlier said that @entity14 was an active participant in the firefight , implying that he was armed and gave the @entity27 little choice but to shoot him down			1
after the operation , @entity4 forces departed with the @entity32 leader 's body , nearly 10 years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity4			1
" it was a staggering undertaking and there was no one else , i believe , other than an @entity4 group of military warriors who could do it , " @entity4 vice president @entity34 said tuesday			0
" and the world is a safer place today , not only for the @entity4 people but for all people			0
" officials on tuesday offered new details about the raid and clarified earlier accounts			0
@entity4 military personnel arrived on two helicopters , attacked the residence and started moving methodically from room to room , said @entity19 press secretary @entity54			1
they were engaged in a firefight throughout the operation , he said			2
there were no armed guards around the compound , according to a @entity4 official who is not authorized to speak on the record			1
original plan cia director @entity64 told @entity69 " that the original plan was for two @entity66 helicopters , carrying 25 people , to go into the compound			2
the first was to go over a courtyard , while the second was to go over the roof			0
but the first helicopter had problems and had to set down on the ground , prompting the second one to do the same , he said			0
" both teams immediately went into the compound itself			2
they had to breach about three or four walls in order to get in there , " he said			0
" they were able to do that and they immediately then went into the compound itself and fought their way up to the third floor			2
" officials called the @entity4 operation a surgical raid -- and said it was conducted by a small team and designed to minimize collateral damage			2
the compound is in @entity0 , about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) north of the @entity1 capital of @entity99			2
the city sits in a region where most residents are army personnel			0
when it was first built , the compound was secluded and reachable by only a dirt road , officials have said			2
in recent years , more residences were built around it , but it remained by far the largest and most heavily secured property in the area			0
the compound had outer walls up to 18 feet tall topped with barbed wire , with two security gates and a series of internal walls that sectioned off different portions of the compound , senior administration officials have said			2
@entity14 " did n't hold his hands up " months of intelligence work determined that the compound was custom - built to hide a high - value terrorism suspect , almost certainly @entity14			1
there was no telephone or internet service at the dwelling , which was valued at more than $ 1 million			0
its occupants burned their trash rather than leave it out for collection as other area residents did			0
besides the @entity14 family , two other families lived in the compound , according to @entity54			1
on the first floor of the building , two @entity32 couriers were killed in addition to a woman caught in the crossfire , he said			0
@entity14 and his family lived on the second and third floors , and they were cleared last , with @entity14 killed toward the end of the siege , @entity54 said			1
@entity14 was not armed but did put up resistance when @entity4 forces entered the compound , he said			1
according to the @entity4 official , who is not authorized to speak on the record , @entity14 " did n't hold his hands up and surrender			1
" a woman in the room with him -- believed to be @entity14 's wife -- rushed @entity4 forces and was shot in the leg , but not killed , said @entity54			1
officials had earlier said that @entity14 was shielded during the shooting by women , including his wife			1
five of the approximately two dozen people in the compound were killed -- the two couriers , the woman , @entity14 and his son , said the @entity4 official who sought anonymity			1
@entity64 told @entity69 he did n't think @entity14 said anything to @entity4 forces before he was killed			1
" to be frank , i do n't think he had a lot of time to say anything			0
it was a firefight going up that compound and by the time they got to the third floor and found @entity14 , i think this was all split second action on the part of the @entity27 , " he said			1
team practiced on a replica of the compound prior to the assault , @entity4 intelligence officials provided detailed satellite images of the compound , which was enough to construct a replica , according to a senior defense official			1
team members practiced on that mock - up , and knew the height of every wall , and which gates to go through , the official said			2
@entity198 and senior administration officials have said that no @entity4 forces were harmed during the operation			2
according to the senior administration officials , intelligence work determined at the beginning of 2011 that @entity14 might be at the compound in @entity1			1
by mid-february , the intelligence was strong enough to begin considering action			0
to discuss that intelligence and develop a plan , @entity198 chaired five @entity210 meetings from between march and april , with the last two on april 19 and april 28 -- last thursday			0
the next day , on friday , @entity198 gave the order for the mission , the officials said			0
multiple options a @entity4 official said multiple options were considered before settling on the assault			2
" a bombing would not have risked @entity4 lives but it might have left questions " as to whether @entity14 was killed , the official said			1
national security officials agreed " the best option is the one that gives proof , " the official said			0
the key break involved one of @entity14 's trusted couriers , according to various officials			1
about two years ago , intelligence work identified where the courier and his brother lived and operated in @entity1			0
it took until august of last year to find the compound in @entity0 , they said			0
" when we saw the compound where the brothers lived , we were shocked by what we saw -- an extraordinarily unique compound , " one senior administration official said			1
" the compound sits on a large plot of land in an area that was relatively secluded when it was built			0
it is roughly eight times larger than the other homes in the area			0
" noting that the courier and his brother had no discernible source of wealth to live at such a property , intelligence analysts concluded the compound was " custom - built to hide someone of extraordinary significance , " the official said , adding : " everything was consistent with what experts thought @entity14 's compound would look like			1
" @entity2 's @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0

the operation lasted nearly 40 minutes
the compound had no armed guards , an official says
@entity14 " resisted , " but was not armed , the @entity19 says
