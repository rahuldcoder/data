-- the @entity2 - based arm of the @entity4 terrorist network claimed responsibility friday for last week 's plot to send explosive devices on cargo planes bound for the @entity9			1
@entity10 , which had been suspected in the plot , posted its claim on various radical @entity14 websites , saying , " we will continue to strike blows against @entity9 interests and the interest of @entity9 's allies			1
" the statement also claimed the group is responsible for the crash of a @entity24 cargo plane in @entity25 , @entity26 , on september 3			1
investigators said earlier this month they had failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in that crash , which killed the two pilots aboard , according to a @entity9 government official			2
about 45 minutes after @entity33 departed @entity34 for @entity35 , @entity36 , the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit			0
they asked to return to @entity25 , but shortly before the plane could get to the airport it crashed			0
officials in the @entity26 have said -- and a @entity9 official confirmed -- that the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion			2
explosions have distinctive sound signatures , and that would have been recorded on the device , the official said			0
the @entity26 said it has " eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion , following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage			0
" a @entity9 counterterrorism official said friday that while " there are very strong indications that @entity10 was responsible for plotting last week 's disrupted cargo plane plot ... we ca n't confirm at this point their claims about the early september incident			1
" @entity69 counterterrorism chief @entity68 said sunday that the @entity9 is " looking very carefully " at the september crash to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft			1
the latest threat was revealed october 29 when authorities in the @entity26 and @entity75 found two explosives - laden packages sent from @entity2 that were addressed to synagogues in @entity79 , @entity80			1
the statement by @entity10 said that since @entity85 media did not link the september @entity24 plane crash to the group , " we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation			1
" " we did that this time using two devices , one of which was sent via the @entity9 @entity24 company and the other via the @entity9 @entity95 company , " the statement said			1
the devices , loaded with the powerful explosive @entity99 , were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone , a source close to the investigation has said			0
friday 's claim of responsibility by @entity10 warned that " since both operations were successful , we intend to spread the idea to our mujahedeen brothers in the world and enlarge the circle of its application to include civilian aircraft in the @entity112 as well as cargo aircraft			1
" @entity9 investigators believe that @entity4 bombmaker @entity115 , 28 , is linked to the packages , according to a federal official who was briefed by authorities			2
@entity119 , who is thought to be in @entity2 , is a @entity120 who ranked high on @entity120 's list of most wanted published in february 2009			0
he is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year 's failed attempt to blow up a @entity9 airliner as it landed in @entity126 , @entity127 , on december 25			0
a @entity9 official said that the devices found in the packages last week were very sophisticated and could have exploded in flight , but it was n't clear whether that was the intent			1
the group 's statement said the devices ' designs " allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination , and they are designed to pass through all detectors			0
" the packages were discovered thanks to a tip from @entity120			0
@entity120 officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages bound for @entity154 organizations in the @entity9 , enabling quick tracing to the @entity75 and @entity25 , a source told @entity0			1
friday 's statement denounced the @entity120 assistance in thwarting the plot , saying , " @entity160 has exposed you and showed the world that you are nothing but treacherous agents to the @entity154 because these bomb packages were headed to @entity154 - @entity166 temples , and you had to intervene with your treacherous ways to protect them , so may @entity160 curse you for being the oppressors			2
" but two @entity9 officials said that the street addresses found on the packages were not the current locations of the synagogues and that the packages were addressed to historical figures from the @entity176 and the @entity177			0
after last week 's incidents , @entity9 government authorities grounded packages originating from @entity2 destined for the @entity9			2
@entity2 has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups , but the country , the ancestral home of @entity184 , is still used for operations , @entity9 officials say			0
@entity0 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 says it will spread the package - bomb idea to others
the group also says it is responsible for the september crash of a @entity24 cargo plane
