-- something was different in 2013			2
unlike recent years , when some of the major events were powered by groups and movements -- think revolutions that seemed to materialize out of nowhere , public squares occupied without visible leadership -- this year , it was individuals who created the most unexpected or dramatic events			1
some of this year 's crucial stories resulted from the interaction of individuals challenging institutions , organizations or the status quo			1
other times , they succeeded			2
but mostly they gave a shove to history , trying to knock it onto a different path			2
these are my candidates for what defined 2013 : the spies got out - spied @entity30 had n't yet turned 30 when he threw back the curtain , exposing the astonishing scale of surveillance by the @entity34			1
while the @entity34 had its sights on other things , a single contractor in its midst triggered an earthquake			1
@entity30 left his @entity34 job with hundreds of thousands of documents , revealing how the @entity34 was gobbling up " meta - data , " records of telephone calls and e-mails , even from world leaders and @entity44 allies			1
the revelations showed an almost omnipotent @entity34 , capable of learning any of our secrets			1
and yet , it bared an agency that could be embarrassingly bested by a single man			2
to some a hero , to others a traitor , @entity30 forced an examination of how far society is willing to allow the government to spy on people 's lives			1
if @entity30 did n't act , would we have slipped quickly and easily into an orwellian state without knowing what our government had been doing ? a pope more concerned with inequality than sexuality in march , @entity70 cardinals gathered in @entity71 to choose an @entity73 priest as the new pope , the first @entity75 pope in nearly 1,300 years			1
pope @entity76 has emerged as the most innovative pope in living memory			1
@entity0 poll : @entity74 's approval rating sky high he is challenging the mighty forces of tradition in the @entity84 , wearing a benevolent smile while surely facing murmurs of dissent behind @entity89 walls			1
the @entity74 decried the @entity84 's obsession with homosexuality , abortion and birth control , prodding @entity94 to fight poverty and inequality instead			1
he has become an endless source of surprises , phoning his newspaperman to cancel his subscription , paying his hotel bill in person and refusing to move to the papal residence			2
can @entity76 succeed in bringing lasting changes to one of the world 's oldest , most conservative institutions ? we will find out			1
struggling @entity109 pulls a rabbit out of the hat the dispute with @entity109 over its nuclear weapons began a new chapter with the surprise election of @entity116			2
the new @entity109 president sharply shifted to conciliatory tones , but much doubt remains about whether that will result in real changes			2
@entity121 put the odds for a final deal at 50/50			0
it is @entity116 's boss , @entity126 ayatollah @entity125 , who has the final say in @entity109			1
nothing happens without his approval , not even a change of tone			0
it is not clear he has decided to change the goals of @entity109 's nuclear program			1
almost two decades have passed since the @entity44 and other countries started imposing sanctions on @entity109 , aiming to prevent what they believe -- and @entity109 denies -- is a nuclear weapons program			0
@entity109 and the @entity143 - led world powers made an interim deal to slow some of @entity109 's progress for six months and roll back some sanctions			1
that created excitement in some quarters and consternation in others , especially because @entity109 appears to have found a way to continue enriching uranium even though the @entity154 had specifically demanded it stop			0
who wins ? some would say @entity109 , thanks to @entity116			0
@entity121 scored self - goal with @entity159 rollout when it comes to individuals challenging the status quo , the @entity160 is not exactly @entity164 , but @entity121 took on the system and then trampled himself in it			1
the story might have been the political dysfunction and the government shutdown that left @entity44 disgusted with @entity143			0
@entity121 seemed to be scoring points after standing firm against @entity171			0
what tripped him most painfully required no intervention from his critics			0
it was the disastrous rollout of the signature achievement of his presidency , the @entity159 , better known as @entity159			0
when @entity44 stopped shaking their heads at the shutdown , they discovered the @entity159 rollout disaster unfolding			0
@entity121 's approval rating took a plunge , made steeper by his initial denial that there was a problem			1
when a contrite @entity121 declared " that 's on me , " he found little disagreement			1
in @entity190 , @entity121 fumbled and @entity191 stays in power when 2012 drew to a close , we knew the suffering of the @entity190 people was nowhere near its end			0
who would have guessed that by the end of 2013 , the @entity190 regime would be strengthened ? after calling for @entity190 president @entity201 to step down in the face of mounting deaths , @entity121 , along with much of the @entity204 , seemed to have no clear idea what to do next			0
he worried that the opposition fighting against his dictatorship would give rise to a new regime dominated by @entity213 extremists			0
@entity121 drew a " red line , " saying the use of chemical weapons by @entity191 would change his calculus			0
then @entity191 used chemical weapons , and @entity121 announced he had decided the @entity44 had to intervene			0
@entity121 is not a natural risk - taker			0
when he decided to take action in @entity190 , he went out on a limb , but quickly he reversed course , afraid to challenge public opinion			0
he surprised everyone with the announcement that he would await congressional authorization			0
the congressional green light looked doubtful when secretary of state @entity227 off - handedly suggested intervention could be prevented if @entity191 surrendered his chemical weapons			0
@entity190 's ally @entity231 picked up the idea and launched into a diplomatic offensive that saved @entity191 from @entity235 attack and saved @entity121 from political shame			2
as @entity231 's @entity238 made his victory lap , the @entity190 people continued to endure relentless assault by @entity191 and his @entity242 ally , @entity243			1
the death count has continued to climb , and the winter weather is adding to the misery of @entity190 's civilians			2
@entity238 outwitted @entity121 , and another dictator gets the last laugh			0
as we look back on 2013 , it 's worth remembering that we are all not just witnesses ; we are the protagonists of our time in history			1
individuals can change history , for better or worse			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			0

@entity260 : some individuals made a huge impact by challenging the status quo
@entity265 : if not for @entity30 , we would n't know about @entity34 's *massive* spying
she says pope @entity76 is challenging the mighty forces of @entity70 tradition
@entity265 : we are all not just witnesses ; we are the protagonists of our own time
