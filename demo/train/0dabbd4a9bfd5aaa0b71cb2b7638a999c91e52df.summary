debris from @entity0 lay splayed for miles across silent rural fields in eastern @entity2 on saturday			1
two days after the jet crashed , some bodies remained strapped in seat belts -- wearing inflight headphones			1
conspicuously missing at the crash site near @entity8 were international forensic workers needed to secure and sort the wreckage , and a recovery crew to identify and remove with dignity the bodies of the 298 people who were on board @entity15			1
a few things have been moved			2
luggage was stacked in piles ; mementos , children 's toys were handled			2
most everything is unguarded , there for the curious -- or for the taking			2
but the debris field has n't changed much overall since it slammed into place from about 30,000 feet in the air			0
not like it would change , if investigators had a chance to cordon it off and catalog it			0
plane parts , books , bodies a round piece of wreckage the size of a small garage -- part of the cabin perhaps -- stood tilted over personal effects of people heading for vacation			1
fields were bestrewn with novels , beach sandals , guide books and colorful carry - on bags			0
and all around them were the bodies of their owners , some dressed in shorts and other vacation wear			1
with leaders around the world calling for a swift , thorough and professional investigation , in eastern @entity2 , a small group of local government workers camping near the wreckage emerge from their tents in the mornings			1
they split up the crash site territory in an orderly manner to look for bodies , said journalist @entity68 , who visited the site			1
the emergency workers mark spots where they find human remains with stakes and tie white rags around them			0
there are so many of them			0
bodies lie by the roadside , some in fields , some intertwined with parts of the aircraft			1
and they are spread out so far			0
" half of them are so mangled , you could n't identify them , " @entity68 said			0
collecting bodies not their job a witness who saw the people falling to @entity91 on tuesday said they had appeared from out of the cloud cover -- like horrifying rainfall , after the plane tore apart in the sky			1
emergency workers tell @entity97 it 's not their job to collect the bodies			1
and a local @entity101 rebel leader has said that officials from the @entity103 and @entity0 asked that the bodies not be moved			1
but rescue crews and inspectors from those countries are not on site			2
and to get there , they would have to drive about 90 minutes from the city of @entity112 down pot - hole pocked roads			0
but these lead through a war zone , past checkpoints set up by varying local militias			0
there is no central command , virtually no rule of law			0
three separate @entity101 rebel groups guard the perimeter of the crash site alone , @entity68 said			1
a small international delegation a delegation of 21 monitors from the @entity128 in @entity129 made it in after assurances from rebel leaders , but local militiamen at the site allowed them only a brief view of a small outtake of the crash site			1
" it basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now , guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable , " said @entity138 spokesman @entity137			0
they asked militiamen for their commander , their leader , he said			0
" no one showed up			0
" an armed man who appeared to have been drinking was there , @entity137 said , but he was n't helpful			2
" he kind of rushed all of them away , including the journalists			0
" militiamen would have to trust international and @entity2 crews enough to let them in , and trust is scarce in the conflict zone , @entity68 said			1
many militiamen hold conspiracy theories about the crash			2
" they claim that it 's a provocation conjured up by the @entity2 authorities in @entity167			1
" they do n't trust anything coming out of @entity167 , he said			0
the @entity138 crew is at the site to get an overview and report back what they see			2
they usually act as observers in conflict zones and are not equipped or trained to recover bodies and evidence			2
but for now , they , the local workers and a few journalists are the only ones there to care			0
