-- the federal government may require automakers to road test cars to ensure the accuracy of gas mileage claims , the @entity1 confirmed tuesday			1
currently , the @entity1 road tests 10 to 15 percent of new vehicles every year , but the other 85 % are tested by the car companies themselves , typically through use of computer modeling , wind tunnels and treadmill - like tests			1
but those methods have come under scrutiny			0
@entity17 's @entity16 and @entity18 lowered fuel economy estimates for some 2012 and 2013 models after the @entity1 found discrepancies between agency results and data submitted by the company			0
mileage claims were lowered by 1 or 2 miles per gallon on most cars , but the @entity27 was adjusted by 6 miles per gallon			1
and @entity28 last month agreed to make a " goodwill payment " to owners of 2013 - and 2014 - model year hybrid vehicles and most 2014 @entity32 after the @entity1 challenged its mileage claims			1
the answer , the @entity1 says , is to require car makers to conduct road tests			1
" some automakers already do this , but we are establishing a regulatory requirement for all auto makers , " @entity37 , director of the @entity1 's @entity38 , told the @entity39			0
the proposal has not been formalized , and would have to go through a lengthy public comment and review period			0
" at this early stage , it is premature for us to speculate on what form a proposal may take , " the agency said in a statement tuesday			0
" @entity1 will engage interested stakeholders proactively before making any proposal			0
" the @entity1 said the wind tunnel and other tests are important to get repeatable , reliable data			2
but it said it is considering requiring road tests			2
the @entity61 administration has pushed through significant changes in auto mileage requirements for passenger cars and light trucks , including suvs , pickups and minivans , as a way to reduce @entity71 oil consumption			1
related policies and consumer demand with gas prices going up have led to design changes , lighter vehicles , cleaner - burning engines and more gas - electric hybrid vehicles			0
cars that go further on a gallon of gas are also a big selling point with consumers looking to save money at the pump .			2

the @entity1 has challenged some car companies on their gas mileage claims
@entity1 road tests only a *fraction* of vehicles , while car companies *basically* use other methods
the @entity61 administration has pushed through *tougher* *standards* for better gas mileage
consumers have responded , driven by saving money at the pump
