-- it 's a sport made up of birdies and eagles , so perhaps it 's no surprise that a large @entity5 flightless bird has found a home away from home at a rural @entity9 golf club			1
the rhea -- similar in appearance to an ostrich -- disappeared from a pen at its owner 's home five weeks ago in the town of @entity17 in @entity18			1
attempts to track it down are focused on the area surrounding @entity22 near the town of @entity24 , roughly five miles away			1
with its top speed approaching 40 miles per hour , catching the four - foot - tall rhea , which has been spotted dashing along the greens and fairways , sounds like a task too far for even sprinter @entity31			1
but local golfers and staff at @entity22 are n't too concerned			2
many have welcomed media who have descended on the club and taken to snapping pictures of the rhea when it appears from the miles of fields surrounding the 18 - hole course			1
" we 've had everybody and his brother down here , " said one senior member who asked not to be named for fear of being bombarded with media requests			2
" the greenkeepers have had little videos on ( their ) phones and they 've sold them			2
" obviously it 's a bird that 's escaped and it 's all over the place			1
it 's not in one particular place			2
" animal welfare charity the @entity58 has been reportedly warning members of the public about approaching the rhea , stating that the birds have extremely sharp claws and the potential to be dangerous if they feel threatened			1
but not all are convinced of the danger			0
" the papers have made it a man - killer , it 's ridiculous what they are saying , " said the @entity22 member , referring to alarmist stories that have appeared in print and on television segments			1
" it 's not dangerous in any way , shape or form			0
they ( media ) have made all that up			0
if you get within about 20 or 30 yards of it , it just runs away			0
if you cornered it in some way it might turn on you but that happens with anything			0
" dangerous or not , what plans are in place to catch the runaway bird ? " they ca n't capture it , they do n't even know how , " the @entity22 member said			2
unless , that is , the birds and the bees play a helping hand			0
" it 's a female , as it happens , but the only way you 're going to catch is if you 've got a male , " the golfer said			0
" when it comes into the mating season and the male starts doing whatever it does , then you 'll ( apparently ) be alright			0
