-- @entity2 's fairytale at the @entity3 will have one more enthralling chapter after it overcame the might of four - time champion @entity6 to seal a place in the final for the very first time in @entity11 wednesday			1
in a contest which was marred by a number of mystifying refereeing decisions , @entity2 survived the sending off of striker @entity15 and the ruling out of a seemingly legitimate strike to prevail on penalties			1
with the game ending 1 - 1 after extra-time , it was the @entity2 which held its nerve to progress 3 - 2 on penalties and advance to sunday 's showpiece final against @entity26			1
' @entity26 ' end @entity29 's @entity3 hopes the @entity26 had earlier booked their place in the final with a convincing 4 - 1 win over @entity33 in @entity34			1
@entity2 , which had not won a game away from home at the tournament before arriving in @entity38 , had endured a frustrating night with referee @entity40 's display a constant cause of consternation			1
but it will now have to take on @entity26 without star striker @entity44 , who was harshly shown a second yellow card for diving when it looked as if he had been fouled			1
@entity44 's 117th minute dismissal leaves the @entity2 without its two star strikers following the injury to talented forward @entity51			2
@entity2 should have been given the chance to take an early lead when @entity54 sent @entity44 hurtling towards the turf inside the @entity6 penalty area , but the referee wrongly waved away appeals for a spot kick			1
instead , it was @entity6 which was controversially awarded a penalty after the @entity40 adjudged that @entity62 had been fouled inside the penalty area			2
@entity63 stood up to fire home from 12 yards and net his fourth goal of the competition			0
what can we expect from the @entity69 ? with both teams struggling to play on a terrible surface at the @entity73 , the game lacked any real sort of quality			0
but what it lacked in quality it more than made up for in drama and excitement as @entity2 continued to fight back against a perceived injustice			2
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity82 produced a wonderful reaction save to deny @entity84 , while @entity85 hit a post for the @entity6			2
but with an hour on the clock , the underdog finally got its reward as @entity90 was allowed time and space to fire home a deserved equalizer			0
@entity2 make giant strides with the game moving into extra-time , @entity2 appeared to have scored a dramatic winner when @entity99 beat @entity82 to the ball and prodded into the net			2
but most of those packed inside the stadium were left in disbelief when @entity40 ruled the goal out for a minor clash with @entity108			0
worse was to follow for the @entity2 when @entity15 was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for diving , despite replays showing he was quite clearly fouled			2
in the end , the contest went to penalties and it was @entity2 which held its nerve with @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity90 all scoring to send it through to the final			1
@entity121 captain @entity120 told reporters : " the referee is human , all humans make mistakes , but he happened to make too many tonight			0
but we 're not going to dwell on that , we 've qualified			0
" ' @entity26 ' end @entity29 's @entity3 hopes in the day 's early kick off , @entity26 reached the final for the first time since 2000 following a comfortable victory over @entity33			1
the @entity133 scored three times in 20 first half minutes to take control of the contest and leave manager @entity137 dreaming of repeating the triumph he pulled off as a player in 1994			0
@entity140 headed @entity26 ahead on 25 minutes before @entity141 added a second on the half - hour mark			1
@entity144 then deflected @entity146 's free - kick into the @entity33 net to leave his side facing an uphill struggle			1
and @entity150 , who replaced the injured @entity151 , inflicted further punishment on @entity33 when he ran through to score eight minutes after the interval			2
@entity33 , which famously came back from 4 - 0 down to draw 4 - 4 with @entity155 in the opening game of the 2010 finals , pulled one back through substitute @entity158 in the 75th minute			1
@entity26 go through but that failed to take the shine off for manager @entity137 , who is now hoping to become only the second man in the tournament 's history to win the tournament as a player and a coach after @entity169 's @entity168 , who won it in 1959 and 1998			0
" we won in 1994 after we had been together for five years , " he told reporters			0
" but we have been together for five weeks			0
we met up for the first time in our training camp in @entity175 before the tournament , and it was a young group			0
" we worked hard , the atmosphere was wonderful but you can not compare this team to that			0
we did play very well today and i am very happy but we have n't won anything yet			0
