-- we began breakfast one recent morning delivering this news to @entity4 : @entity5 , her caregiver , was going on a two - week vacation			1
" who is going to take care of me ? " she asked			2
and then she gave me " the look			2
" i call it pouty face			2
her dime - sized brown eyes squeeze together , the lower lip rolls out , the hands ball up			1
every time she looks like that , my crazy @entity17 empties of sugarplum fairies and fills with fears of pedophilia and child snatching			2
previously on @entity0 : i 'm her mom , not the nanny ! we have had the same babysitter since @entity4 was born			1
@entity5 would step in front of a train for @entity4			1
she is not easily replaced			2
but when @entity4 was a baby , we figured we had options			1
there is a reason @entity32 gave us mothers , tias ( aunties ) , abuelitas ( grandmothers ) and the occasional bff you call " co-madre " regardless of whether they are actually your kid 's godmother and hence your " co-mother			1
" the problem is every @entity43 in @entity44 works until death			1
there is no cotton - topped @entity47 on standby sitting in her house - dress feeding chickens			1
i do n't think all @entity51 are so overprotective of their kids			2
@entity4 was just a baby the first time @entity5 went on vacation			1
i called my mother who lives in @entity56 and laid on the guilt			2
i recited the @entity59 statistic that 1 in 4 girls is sexually abused before age 18 ( it 's all about sexual abuse with the @entity63 )			1
she hopped on a train and i left for work			1
she called me an hour later with @entity67 blaring in the background			0
@entity4 had early pouty face			1
she must be malnourished by my lousy parenting and in need of chicken soup			0
i told my mother she drinks only breast milk and to look in the fridge			0
@entity4 began throwing up at 3 a.m. i called the pediatrician , who yelled through the speakerphone to call 911			1
" you ate soup when you were a week old , " my mother admitted sheepishly			0
@entity80 : my nanny 's sadness is also my own @entity5 demanded to vet her next replacement			1
she hangs out with a legion of sitters representing all the nations of @entity89 and @entity90 , and they have their special ways			1
children should be stuffed with comfort food ; pock marked by lipstick kisses , wrinkled from hugging and rocking , and wear fuzzy socks because their feet can never be too warm			0
i 'm not saying other ethnic groups do n't coddle their kids , but @entity51 just seem to excel at it			0
i remember being handed a worksheet at a @entity63 and me group that mapped out three goals for toddlers : adaptation , separation , and integration			0
my sitter and her gang laughed at me			1
adaptation ? @entity110 will do it when she 's ready			1
for months my toilet was surrounded by @entity43 sitters staring at @entity115 , waiting for poo			1
mamas , grandmas , nanas , your 400 tias and most particularly your girlfriends are in this with you cradle - to - grave			2
integration ? yes , they are allowed to play with children being raised by their friends			0
i was n't going to be drawn into this kind of ethnocentricity			0
my employer offers a service providing bonded , certified , triple - a , recommended , backup babysitters			2
my sitter threatened to pull my @entity43 card			1
" you 're leaving your / my child with a total stranger in a strange land ? ! " i reminded her i was born here			0
the next morning " @entity142 " arrived			0
@entity4 gave me pouty face , but i walked out the door with my head high			1
i got a call an hour later			0
one of @entity5 's snitches was at my apartment			1
" she 's feeding her cold plantains , " she whispered in @entity149			2
i told her to butt out			0
then came call no. 2 , this time from my neighbor			0
" the @entity149 nannies are icing the replacement , " she warned me			0
" @entity4 has pouty face			1
" call no. 3 came from the sitter herself			2
" @entity4 does n't want to take a nap or eat her porridge , " she said			1
" @entity4 no longer naps , and what is porridge ? " i asked			1
i came home after call no. 5 to a troupe of nannies staring down this poor woman from " a @entity170 country where they do n't even speak @entity149			0
" i accused everyone of bigotry and got that stare that says " new mom			0
" @entity142 revealed she had never cared for a child " this particular age " and said she had to go			0
the specter of @entity142 reigned over our household for months			0
if you do n't behave , @entity142 will be coming for the weekend			0
clean up your toys , or @entity142 will pick you up from preschool			0
if only i could find that woman , i 'd hire her one more time just to revive the memory			0
the next replacement sitter was an aging woman sent by an agency with hearts and fairies dancing across their logo			1
not an hour after her arrival came phone call no. 1			0
" @entity17 , it 's @entity4			1
i 'm on the phone upstairs			0
" let 's start with the fact that @entity4 had never dialed the phone on her own			1
" why are you upstairs ? " i inquired			0
" i do n't nap			0
i do n't want bath			0
" i could feel pouty face through the phone			0
the nanny was on the other line complaining that @entity4 would n't bathe at 2 o'clock in the afternoon			1
" @entity17 come ! " i was home in an hour			0
during her next vacations , she outsourced @entity4 to her tribe -- @entity210 from @entity211 , @entity212 from @entity213 , @entity214 from @entity215			1
it was a brilliant solution for about a year , until all their kiddies started school			0
suddenly , mamas were ditching their @entity43 sitters left and right in exchange for grimy after - school programs and college students trying to make an extra buck toward tuition			1
those who did n't soon lost their sitters to more fulltime jobs			1
but her next vacation left us in a lurch			2
we requested a @entity149 speaker from an agency , and they sent a woman from @entity236			2
an hour later , my building superintendent called			0
" your baby sitter is a freak , " he said			1
" @entity4 told me to call			1
and she 's not @entity236			2
" who pretends to be @entity236 to get a job ? i could n't come home			0
i posted a cry for help to my faux friends on @entity247 , which elicited only sympathy			0
" would you like me to take her ? " he asked , he of the four kids who 've scampered our halls chatting in @entity255 since they were toddlers			0
great ! he even has the keys ! i expressed my glee on @entity247 and the replies poured in			0
in short order , my super was accused of being a pedophile , a child trafficker , a canonize - able saint , and a shyster looking to rob me			2
i got home to find @entity4 with his daughter , @entity268 , all grown up , making paper bag puppets			1
pouty face no more ! @entity272 -- sitter @entity273 ! i had found an unemployed college graduate who lives down the hall and is great with kids			2
i was all set until i got altruistic and recommended her to a friend			0
less than a year later she had a fulltime job			0
that brings me back to this week			0
as soon as i mentioned back - up care , @entity5 sprung into action and ran it all by @entity4 who now talks in full sentences			1
they announced a girl named @entity289 would be monitoring @entity4			1
i also hired a lovely girl from back - up care who they allowed to hang out with them			2
i still had @entity4 cruising from play - date to play - date			1
@entity5 somehow managed to monitor the entire thing from the @entity296			1
by week 's end , everyone had it covered			2
i was out of it , sitting totally detached at work , sporting my own pouty face .			2

@entity80 was lost when her regular baby - sitter , @entity5 , took a vacation
@entity80 's daughter , @entity4 , chased away the women an agency sent to watch her
@entity5 arranged an army of @entity43 sitters to sit in for her , which seemed to work
