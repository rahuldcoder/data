the finance ministers from the 17 nations that use the euro , known as the @entity10 , gave @entity5 the funding it needs to avoid a potential default next month			1
while this new deal provides some short - term relief for @entity5 , difficult days lie ahead as the government tries to trim debt to 121 % of the country 's gross domestic product by 2020			1
@entity5 's debt now stands at about 160 % of gdp			1
the announcement came at an early morning press conference in @entity23 after finance ministers met for more than 13 hours			0
" in the past two years and again this night , i 've learned that ' marathon ' is indeed a @entity5 word , " said @entity25 , vice president of the @entity26			2
" but in the end we came to an agreement ( that is ) very far - reaching and important			0
" " it 's clear that the @entity5 economy can not rely anymore on a large public administration financed by cheap debt , but rather needs to lean on investment both @entity5 and foreign , " @entity25 said			1
" this should give @entity5 enough space to improve its competitiveness , " added @entity37 , managing director of the @entity38 , saying that the goal of the terms of the new bailout is to create growth for the @entity5 economy			1
" there are downside risks , that is clear			0
" @entity5 is in its fifth year of recession , and the government reported last week that @entity5 's gdp , the broadest measure of a nation 's economic output , fell 6.8 % last year			1
that 's much worse than the 6 % contraction the government originally predicted			2
fourth - quarter gdp also continued to decline , shrinking 7 % , compared with a 5 % decrease in the third quarter			0
this new program will give " financial stability in @entity5 and in the euro area as a whole , " the @entity10 said in a statement announcing the deal			2
" the @entity10 is fully aware of the significant efforts already made by the @entity5 citizens but also underlines that further major efforts by the @entity5 society are needed to return the economy to a sustainable growth path			1
" an austerity pact was approved by the @entity5 parliament on february 12 , leading to some of the worst riots in the country in recent years			1
the package , which included deep cuts in government spending , wages and pensions , helped pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to sign off on tuesday 's new bailout deal			0
tuesday 's bailout deal " certainly removes some near - term risk , " said @entity84 , senior economist for @entity85 in @entity86			2
" i think it 's clear that questions will emerge whether @entity5 can stomach these cuts			1
" @entity5 voters are scheduled to head to the polls for parliamentary elections in april , a vote that will widely be viewed as a referendum on the tough austerity measures the nation faces			1
@entity5 has also hammered out a plan to write down â‚¬ 100 billion worth of @entity5 government bonds and swap existing debt for securities with lower interest rates , a deal that would result in losses of 53.5 % of nominal value for the private sector			1
the euro raised a half percent against the dollar to 1.327 within minutes of the announcement , but otherwise market reaction was muted during @entity114 trading hours , suggesting investors have already priced in the bailout deal , analysts said			0
" there are details to be worked out			0
big work is done now , i think that will provide relief to financial markets , " @entity84 said			0
" but it 's difficult to see this turning around the @entity5 economy anytime soon			1
" while the @entity5 economy is small compared to other eurozone countries -- " about the size of @entity128 compared to the rest of the @entity130 , " @entity84 said -- the real threat is keeping the debt crisis and borrowing costs from spiraling to larger economies in the eurozone			1
a default by @entity5 could spark " a @entity138 - like event , " he said , referring to the collapse of the investment bank that catalyzed the 2008 financial crisis			2
" i think we understand these issues much better than we did three years ago , " @entity84 said			0
" kicking these issues down the road has been useful to some extent " because a default would be less likely to take the markets by surprise , he added			0
" the next hurdle is to create a firewall to put up sufficient money to know that @entity153 and @entity154 wo n't be next , " @entity84 said			0
" this today is really short - term relief , but we 'll probably be looking at these issues ( at ) some point			0
" there has been some speculation that @entity5 might exit the eurozone , but @entity10 president @entity161 stressed ahead of monday 's meeting that @entity5 should remain a member of the euro currency union			1
" it is the intention of nobody to have @entity5 outside of the eurozone , " he said			2
" that would be a bad solution for @entity5 and ... a bad solution for the euro area			2
" the @entity5 deal is not the final step toward stabilizing eurozone debt woes			1
pressure remains on both the @entity38 and the @entity178 to provide more support measures , analysts said			0
" from our perspective , clearly you need to have more firepower on the table , " said economist @entity180 at @entity85			0
" investors are waiting to see if the @entity178 will make more direct steps in the sovereign bond market , buying up debt from countries considered vulnerable like @entity190 and @entity191			0
" @entity0 's @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 and @entity196 's @entity195 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
