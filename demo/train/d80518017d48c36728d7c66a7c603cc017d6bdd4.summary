@entity0 won saturday 's @entity2 presidential primary , marking a stunning turnaround for a candidate who finished fourth in @entity5 and @entity6 and whose campaign had been left for dead -- again -- by observers just weeks ago			1
with about 95 % of polling places reporting , @entity9 had 40 % of the vote , with former @entity13 gov. @entity12 getting 27 % and former @entity15 sen. @entity14 getting 17 %			1
@entity15 rep. @entity16 of @entity17 had 13 %			2
based on early returns and exit polls , @entity18 projected @entity9 the winner			2
in his victory speech to supporters , @entity9 thanked " everyone in @entity26 who decided to be with us in changing @entity28			2
" " it is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track -- so many people who are so concerned about jobs , about medical costs , about the everyday parts of life , and who feel that the elites in @entity28 and @entity40 have no understanding , no care , no concern , no reliability , and in fact do not represent them at all , " @entity9 said			2
@entity9 , whose surge has been helped in part by two strong debate performances in @entity26 , said that if he 's resonating with voters , it 's not just because he 's a good debater			1
up - to - minute updates on @entity18 's live blog " it 's that i articulate the deepest - held values of the @entity15 people , " he said			1
since the beginning of the modern @entity2 primary system in 1980 , this is the first time that three different @entity2 candidates won nominating contests in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity26			1
the winner of the @entity26 primary , which this year is the third contest on the primary and caucus calendar , has gone on to win the @entity70 nomination in every election since 1980			1
less than a week ago , @entity12 , the @entity6 winner , was looking at a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in @entity26 , a big lead in @entity76 and the possibility of a clear path to the @entity2 nomination			1
but @entity9 turned in two strong debate performances in the state this week while @entity12 was put on his heels by his rivals			1
@entity12 congratulated @entity9 in remarks to his supporters after polls closed saturday night			1
" this race is getting to be even more interesting , " @entity12 said			0
" ... we 're now three contests into a long primary season			0
this is a hard fight because there is so much worth fighting for			0
" how they voted in @entity26 " our campaign has fought very hard here in @entity26 , and in the coming weeks and months , i 'll keep fighting for every single vote			0
i will compete in every single state , " he said			0
" we 're going to win this nomination , and we 're going to defeat president @entity102 in november			0
" @entity14 , the @entity5 winner , also congratulated @entity9 on saturday night			1
nearly an hour earlier , he told @entity18 that the battle between the first three contests ' winners is just beginning			0
" the great narrative is that three days ago , there was an inevitability in this race , " @entity14 said			0
" @entity12 was 2 - 0 ( before @entity5 officials switched the narrow @entity5 result this week ) and soon to be 3 - 0 , and i took @entity5 , @entity0 took @entity26 , and it 's game on again			1
" @entity14 said he was preparing not only to campaign in @entity76 , where the next primary awaits on january 31 , but in other states , indicating he believed he had what it took to sustain his campaign for a long fight			2
" this is a long race			0
as a result of what happened here tonight , this race is n't going to be over next week or the week after , " @entity14 said			2
" this is going to be a long one , and it 's going to be the best thing that could happen for whoever the eventual @entity70 nominee is , because that nominee is going to be sharpened by steel			0
" @entity16 told supporters he expected to get four to five times as many votes in @entity26 as he did four years ago			0
" so there 's every reason to be encouraged , " he said			0
@entity9 's @entity26 turnaround is just his latest			1
he came out of nowhere to top national polls in late fall on the strength of debate performances , but dropped again ahead of the @entity5 caucuses as opponents hammered him in @entity5 ads. " @entity9 has been harder to kill than @entity143 , " @entity70 strategist and @entity18 contributor @entity145 said saturday			1
" he has been dead three times in this campaign , and ... the guy keeps coming back			0
" are you voting in the @entity26 primary ? share your story according to exit polls saturday , 38 % of voters said they decided whom to vote for in the " last few days , " and 17 % did so on saturday			1
of the " last few days " crowd , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 26 % took @entity12			2
of those who decided saturday , 44 % voted for @entity9 , and 21 % took @entity12			2
@entity9 won a plurality of votes among all income categories except the one for people making $ 200,000 a year or more , a category that @entity12 won with 47 % , according to the exit polls			1
the candidates will now focus on @entity76 , where they will debate in @entity164 on monday and at the @entity18 / @entity70 of @entity76 debate in @entity166 on thursday			0
the former @entity168 speaker has been presenting himself as the conservative alternative to the " @entity13 moderate " @entity12 , while @entity12 continued to attack @entity9 as he has over the past week as polls tightened			1
@entity12 supporters and donors were grumbling saturday that @entity12 's campaign badly mishandled how he responded to rivals ' demands that he release his tax records			2
@entity12 said in a @entity18 debate thursday night that he was not sure how many years of tax returns he plans to release but will make them public sometime in april			0
but as the polls were closing , a @entity12 source tried to downplay the results , noting that @entity12 got only 15 % of the vote in @entity26 in 2008 , a race that eventual nominee sen. @entity185 won			1
the campaign will immediately pivot to @entity76 , the source said , where " we have a strong organization and big plans for next week			0
" @entity12 has held a large lead in polls of likely primary voters there , but recent polls show the race tightening a bit there , too			1
three @entity70 sources told @entity18 that @entity12 has secured the endorsement of former @entity76 gov. @entity201 , who is on many @entity70 ' wish list			0
but a @entity201 source denied the report , and sources in @entity12 's campaign said if that is true , he had n't told them			2
the campaign plans a " major " economic speech on tuesday morning as a prebuttal to @entity102 's @entity211 address that evening and differentiate @entity12 from @entity102 and @entity9			1
he also plans a reaction speech to @entity102 's address on wednesday morning			0
@entity12 launched a new line of attack on @entity9 on saturday before polls closed , calling for him to release details on his work for government - backed mortgage giant @entity219 , an institution unpopular with conservatives			1
" did n't he say he was going to release information about his relationship there ? " @entity12 asked			0
" let 's see what report he wrote for @entity227 and @entity219 , what his conclusions were and what the contract looked like			0
i thought he said he was going to do that			0
" @entity12 's campaign also has been pressing the former @entity168 speaker to release the full report from a 1990s ethics investigation that led to his downfall in @entity239			2
@entity9 was reprimanded by the @entity168 and ordered to pay a $ 300,000 penalty in 1997 for violating an ethics rule			0
this week , @entity12 's campaign sent @entity9 a cake marking the 15th anniversary of that reprimand , according to a @entity12 campaign source			1
a picture provided by that source shows the wording " happy 15th anniversary , mr. speaker ! ... now release the records , " written in icing on the cake			0
things reversed quickly for @entity12 in @entity26 this week			1
as late as tuesday , @entity12 had a double - digit lead in most polls of likely voters in the state 's primary			1
then what had been declared an eight - vote @entity12 victory in @entity5 's january 3 caucuses was reversed into a 34 - vote win for @entity14 when the state party certified its results on thursday			1
later that day , @entity17 gov. @entity265 suspended his campaign and threw his support to @entity9			0
" it has been a hard week , " state treasurer @entity268 , a leading @entity12 surrogate , said friday			2
" nobody is going to deny that			0
" @entity14 spent the week trying to bring down @entity9 in what most see as a race between the moderate @entity12 against conservatives @entity9 or @entity14			1
although most @entity2 strategists see @entity16 's strict interpretation of the @entity277 and his views on defense and spending as out of step with the mainstream , he appeals to libertarian - leaning @entity70 and has a large following among younger voters .			0
