-- if ever there was a @entity3 versus @entity5 clash in international football this was it			0
@entity8 , the reigning world and @entity10 champions taking on @entity11 , ranked 138th by the game 's governing body @entity12 , one place below @entity15			1
almost all of @entity11 's squad are amateur players -- nine are unemployed -- and their coach @entity19 even admitted before the tournament began : " we are not here to win			1
" after a heavy defeat in their opening @entity25 game against @entity26 , @entity19 declared their dream had come true -- solely because they found the net in a 6 - 1 reverse			1
there was to be no goal this time round as they were put to the sword by @entity8 who completed a 10 - 0 victory to all - but secure a semifinal berth			1
that represented the biggest in the history of the competition that pits the champions of each @entity12 confederation against each other and acts as a precursor to next year 's @entity45 in @entity46			2
but @entity11 's squad were afforded a standing ovation from the 71,000 crowd , who backed them throughout the match			2
before the game there was a heavy police presence outside the ground in @entity56 in response to the ongoing protests in @entity46			2
" @entity11 set an example in terms of fair play and went forward whenever they had the opportunity , " @entity8 coach @entity59 said			2
" we did n't score more goals because they did n't let us			0
this game has n't damaged football in any way			0
in some ways it 's made it even stronger			0
" after handing over pendants to their opponents prior to kickoff , @entity11 maintained parity for less than five minutes as @entity76 striker @entity75 beat goalkeeper @entity77 at his near post to put the " @entity8 " ahead			1
any @entity11 foray into @entity8 's half was roared by the crowd but @entity59 's side soon fired two goals in the space of two minutes as @entity85 and @entity75 found the net			1
@entity87 grabbed a goal either side of the break before @entity75 sealed his hat - trick just before the hour mark -- making him the first player to do it twice in the tournament following his three against @entity96 in 2009			1
@entity98 's treble followed soon after , and @entity99 then got number eight			0
@entity75 missed the chance to claim his fourth , sending a penalty over the crossbar after @entity105 was adjudged to have handled the ball			2
but he made amends a minute later as he rounded @entity77 to slot into an empty net			0
@entity85 then got his second , firing home from inside the area			0
the crowd were willing @entity11 forward but the closest they came to scoring was when @entity114 narrowly failed to latch onto @entity116 's pass , but the offside flag had gone up			2
upon the final whistle , @entity11 gave @entity8 a guard of honor as the world champions left the pitch before the minnows took the applause of the crowd			1
however , the battle for semifinal places will go to the last round of @entity128 matches , following @entity130 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity130 in thursday 's late match			1
veteran striker @entity132 celebrated his landmark 100th international appearance -- becoming the first @entity134 to do so -- by scoring the winner six minutes after halftime			0
the 34 - year - old finished off a fine move involving strike partners @entity139 and @entity141 , ending his run of 12 games without a goal for the @entity146 champions			0
it was his 34th goal for his country , putting him ahead of @entity141 in the all - time list			0
captain @entity150 gave @entity130 the lead in the 19th minute but @entity76 midfielder @entity152 equalized eight minutes before the break			0
if @entity130 beat @entity11 on sunday , then @entity26 's @entity26 would have to inflict @entity8 's first defeat of the tournament in order to qualify .			1

world champions @entity8 beat @entity11 10 - 0 in their @entity25 game in @entity56
@entity11 ranked *137* places below the all - *conquering* @entity163 side
@entity75 scores four and @entity87 three in record competition win
battle for semifinal places will go to final round after @entity130 's win over @entity26
