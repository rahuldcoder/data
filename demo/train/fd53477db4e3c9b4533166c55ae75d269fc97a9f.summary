-- at just 31 years old , and already heading a vast business empire he built from scratch , @entity1 has been referred to by some as @entity6 's youngest billionaire			1
but this is a label the @entity9 entrepreneur does n't want to associate himself with			1
" money should never be a measurement for anything , " says @entity1 , founder of the pan-african multi-sector business conglomerate @entity10			1
" i like to see myself as an entrepreneur that 's being disruptive -- i like to be the underdog in a lot of cases , " he adds			2
" it 's all about how you go about it ; but one thing i definitely do n't want to be known as is as ' @entity6 's youngest billionaire			0
' " whilst having problems with that specific description , @entity1 has no issue about claiming other , less corporeal , titles			2
an adventurous spirit , @entity1 is gearing up to become the first ever @entity28 in space , proudly representing the region in the @entity32 program , which offers paying customers the opportunity to travel beyond the @entity36 's atmosphere			1
" i 'm taking quite a few of flags into space , as a way to kind of send a strong message that ' look , we as @entity6 have the vision and the ability as well , " says @entity1			1
" it 's something that started off for fun and it 's actually turned out to be something quite nice where we can send a strong message to say , ' we 're coming , we 're going to mark our space in that territory too			2
" reading this : flying doctor takes to the skies conquering the space frontier seems like a rather fitting move for a maverick entrepreneur such as @entity1 , who quit school around the age of 15 to embark on his first commercial enterprise -- a small it business inside a shopping mall built across the road from his father 's shop in @entity65 , @entity9 's capital			1
" the idea initially was to do it for the two months during my summer holiday , " recalls @entity1			2
" and when school started again i conveniently did n't tell my parents that it did , and obviously they figured me out in a week			0
" @entity1 believes his business journey was easier because of his accommodating parents , who allowed him to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams			1
" so i told them , ' look , if you want me to go through the whole cycle i 'll do it for formality purposes , but i 'm going to end up doing this , so i 'd really appreciate it if you 'd let me do it now			0
' " they were surprisingly really open - minded and kind of gave me the opportunity and said ' look , do it on your own , try it out for a year -- if it does n't work out you go a year behind your friends			0
' " and i 've still got that option open 16 years down the line			0
" so , at the age of 16 , @entity1 spotted a gap in the market and went big			2
as his business evolved , @entity1 started flying to @entity96 to stock up on computer hardware and then sell it for a profit in @entity65			1
" i was flying to @entity96 every weekend because i did n't have the money to set up a shop and have enough working capital to do an air cargo , " recalls @entity1			1
" so monday to friday i 'd sell my goods in @entity9 and on a weekend i 'd actually fly to @entity96 , fill my suitcase up with it stuff again and bring it back , and the same repeated , " he adds			2
this quickly developed into a thriving business and before long @entity1 was branching out into several other areas			1
today , the @entity96 - based @entity10 has grown into a major corporation that operates in 18 @entity28 countries and has various and diverse interests -- from financial services and real estate to communication , manufacturing and agriculture			1
the group also runs the @entity119 , a non-profit arm focused on fostering entrepreneurship among young @entity6			0
read this : african ceos look to bright future while @entity1 acknowledges that there are still many challenges when it comes to doing business in @entity6 , he says the continent holds a fantastic opportunity going forward			1
" the @entity131 is definitely investing more in @entity6 -- or wanting to invest more in @entity6 -- but they 're still investing a lot in @entity133 as well , specifically @entity134 and @entity135			0
[ the ] nice thing is that @entity134 and @entity135 's investing in @entity6 , so the ultimate destination is us , " he says			0
" people do want to come to @entity6 ; people realize that we 're the next big thing -- @entity134 and @entity135 have had their time , it 's now ours			0
" echoing a growing chorus of voices cautioning against exploitative behavior from foreign investors , @entity1 adds that , whilst @entity6 still needs investment in many sectors , gone are the days where the continent desperately relied on outsiders			2
" we 're evolving ; we 're writing our own story now ; we 're making it happen for ourselves , " he says			0
" so i think that 's very important for people to realize that they must plug into what 's important to us and how it should be done that 's going to benefit our countries and our people -- local beneficiation , empowerment of our people			0
" we want to see our economies and our countries transform , so i think people with that mindset , willing to help us on that route , are more than welcome			0
and i think that 's hopefully what we 're going to see more of now , because we 're becoming more picky as countries			0
