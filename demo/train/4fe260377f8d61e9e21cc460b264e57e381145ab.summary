" after a day of innocent house - hunting , i am devastated and my heart hurts that my former very good friend , a person i used to call my ' wifey ' and traveled the world with , is making very public and very untrue allegations about me on @entity2 , " he wrote , adding " it is still too painful " to reveal what caused the end of their friendship			1
he said that as a result of @entity7 's series of tweets sunday , her fans have sent him death threats and posted derogatory comments about his 6 - month - old son			1
