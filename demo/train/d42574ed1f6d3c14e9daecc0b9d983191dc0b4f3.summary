home means many different things to different people			2
it 's an idea that intrigues @entity5 - born photographer @entity4 , who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls			1
she first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who do n't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in april 2013 , while she was in @entity16 studying for her master 's degree			1
the notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later , she said			0
the result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled " @entity25 , " in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place			1
having moved into her new home in a squat in @entity35 , north @entity16 , @entity36 had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs			1
she also found herself part of a wider alternative community that 's both transient and close - knit			2
through the connections she made , she visited six other squats in north and south @entity16			1
one was in a former fabric warehouse , another in an abandoned garden center , a third in a white - walled former design studio			0
" as the squatting scene is very interconnected , i came to discover how diverse squats can be , both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe , " she said			2
" the unusualness of the different places , which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense , intrigued me and shaped my project			2
" all the squats @entity36 visited were in former commercial premises			1
a law enacted in september 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties			0
with housing costs high in @entity16 and affordable options in short supply , squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although , as @entity36 points out , it 's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty			1
" what might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living , " she writes in the text accompanying her images			2
" the squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure , freedom , friendship and self - discovery			2
yet , it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt			0
" the squatters ' campaign group @entity93 ) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time			2
but it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the @entity102 have squatted at one time or another , it says			0
social media follow @ @entity105 on @entity106 to join the conversation about photography			0
the @entity109 , an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need , estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in @entity115			0
about one - third of these homes have been empty for six or more months , it says			0
but since it 's now illegal to squat in residential properties , empty or not , squatters have turned to @entity16 's disused commercial buildings , many of which have been left empty long - term			1
when squatters move in , they bring a new life to the space , often surprising in its incongruity			0
in one of @entity36 's photographs , taken inside the disused fabric warehouse , a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth			1
he 's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric			0
other images show " @entity137 , " a former five - story office block in central @entity16 that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves			1
graffiti covers the walls , and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked			0
another of @entity36 's photographs , taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant , shows a young man and woman , semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood			1
for her project , @entity36 says , she used only a wide - angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects			1
" the use of natural light adds to a candid feel , " she said , adding to the authenticity of the images			0
" i visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes , according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces			0
especially for the squat that i stayed at , i focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home			1
" far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people 's intimate space , @entity36 says she made many friends			1
this was in part because she won people 's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters , tax dodgers or down - and - outs			1
" my fellow squatters knew that i was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle , since i was always carrying my camera with me , " she said			1
" the squatters were very welcoming when i first met them , became my friends , hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs			0
" despite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water , @entity36 says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first			2
from her images and her words , it 's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience			2
" you may not have a shower , but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views , " she writes			0
" you may have to share your room with seven other people , but you may share your happiest moments with them			0
you may have to move 10 times a year , but the diverse places and people you meet become an integral part of your journey through life , turning it into anything but ordinary			0
" @entity4 is a photojournalist and documentary photographer based in @entity234			1
she is on the reportage by @entity237 roster .			0
