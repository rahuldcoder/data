the sales pitch was passionate : sprawling land along a desolate stretch of @entity4 highway , ready to be turned into a pay - as - you - go terrorist training camp			1
" it looks just like @entity12 , " wrote @entity7 in his letter to prominent @entity10 cleric @entity9			1
@entity7 asked for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from @entity10 , so fighters could be readied for the @entity12 frontlines for a hefty per - person fee			1
@entity7 is a pivotal witness against @entity9 in his federal trial on terrorism - related charges and testified in a @entity24 courtroom wednesday about his bumbling efforts to start an @entity27 - style training camp in the @entity28			1
the @entity29 - born @entity9 , whose fiery rhetoric allegedly set the likes of failed " shoe bomber " @entity33 and 9/11 hijacker @entity34 on the path to radicalization , was extradited to the @entity28 in 2012 after an extended legal battle			1
among the allegations against him is the claim he aided in terrorism efforts by sending two men carrying cash and training materials to @entity4 in response to @entity7 's pitch			1
he could face life in prison if convicted			0
defense lawyer @entity48 told the jury during his opening statement that no evidence shows his client gave directions or orders relating to the alleged crimes			2
rather , he was merely a " commenter on events and issues " when he praised @entity56 in his sermons and celebrated the terrorist attacks on @entity59 and @entity60			2
" these are ideas , not acts , " he said			0
" these are expressions , not crimes			0
" during his testimony wednesday , @entity7 said his letter to @entity9 promised scores of eager recruits who had already pledged their loyalty to the preacher , along with a hillside hiding place and personal security detail when he arrived at the camp			1
they were amassing stockpiles of weapons and building living facilities , even a mosque , @entity7 wrote			0
in reality , only two run - down trailers sat atop the barren ranch land , but @entity7 reasoned that things could be taken one step at a time : " if he accepted it , i 'd know i had a buy - in and i 'd start building			1
" @entity94 's presence was crucial to getting the cash flow started , he testified			1
" he 'd be the star attraction			0
" when @entity7 called @entity9 to confirm he had received the detailed note and draft for a camp advertising flier , @entity9 first berated him for being careless and risking law enforcement interception , testified @entity7 , who faxed his letter to the high - profile @entity103 mosque leader from a @entity105 's near his home in @entity107 , @entity60			1
@entity94 nevertheless agreed to support the transatlantic venture , @entity7 said			1
another witness , @entity109 , whose husband owned the property , testified last week she had envisioned it as a " kitchen farm " where women from their @entity116 community could come to learn to grow vegetables , canning and raising animals			2
@entity109 and her former friend @entity120 said @entity7 arrived with @entity9 's men in december 1999 and that the pair 's apparent leader was a physically imposing , temperamental man who claimed to have served as @entity56 's bodyguard			1
when he saw the conditions at the ranch , he flew into a rage			0
" he was very upset			0
there were no men , there were no weapons , there was no hole for @entity9 , " @entity109 testified			2
she said the men discussed a plan to kill @entity7 and take his pregnant wife hostage until she gave birth to their child , after which they would kill her as well and take the infant			2
despite the disappointing state of affairs , @entity9 ordered the men to stay and continue the effort for several weeks , @entity109 testified			2
they conducted perimeter checks and did calisthenics , and once made @entity148 ' mentally disabled teen brother kneel in the dirt for a throat - slitting demonstration , according to testimony			0
@entity109 decided she had finally had enough when the men demanded she use a password to exit her own doublewide trailer , the soft - spoken woman testified			0
" i got in his face about that , " she said			0
not long after that , the men abandoned the effort and returned to @entity162			0
after his 2002 arrest , @entity7 himself faced charges of aiding terrorists through the @entity4 plot and escorting a recruit from @entity10 to training in @entity12 , allegedly on orders from @entity9			1
he was released in 2010 as part of an agreement to testify for the government			0
the trial of @entity9 opened less than a month after @entity56 's son - in - law , @entity175 , was found guilty in the same @entity24 federal courthouse of helping @entity27 members conspire to kill @entity28 and providing material support to terrorists			1
prosecutors said @entity175 , a @entity180 cleric , played a crucial role as the organization 's principal mouthpiece and recruiter , helping " restore @entity27 's trove of new terrorists " as deadly missions turned its members into martyrs			2
@entity190 cuts an unusual figure in the courtroom ; missing one eye and both hands , he wears an occasional writing prosthesis on his right forearm rather than the infamous hook - like device he 's often seen sporting in photographs			2
opting for comfort , he asked his attorneys for sweat pants and t - shirts for the proceedings rather than a suit			0
he has said he plans to testify in his on defense			0
@entity7 resumes his testimony on thursday .			0
