-- minimalist blogging platform @entity1 drew its last breath earlier this week			1
the service , a favorite among mobile bloggers who liked to post on the go , officially shut down four years after it was originally created , one year after it was purchased by @entity8 , and two months after it informed users that it was closing			1
that came on the heels of other closures , and announcements thereof			0
@entity14 , the popular @entity15 tool , will shut down july 1 and @entity16 , the hyper - local news site , was shuttered in february			1
it 's a reality of the internet that sites are constantly starting up , shutting down or getting acquired			1
but that does n't make the loss of a beloved site any less upsetting or inconvenient for its faithful fans			1
to preserve your sanity , and your data , here are a few tips for handling the death of a favorite website or service			1
pay attention to warnings most sites wo n't shutter without giving their users official notice			0
to avoid being caught off - guard , read any updates , e-mails , blog posts or tweets from the company warning of major changes or sharing goodbyes			0
there are also less obvious signs			0
when a company starts neglecting a site 's design or features , that could mean it 's shifting resources to other projects or running low on money			1
@entity14 's last significant update happened in late 2011			1
nearly a year and a half later , @entity57 finally announced the beloved rss reader was being " retired			0
" so ask yourself , does a site seem like it 's stayed exactly the same for the past year , unloved and a little retro around the edges ? does it still have a button to share content on @entity66 but nothing for @entity68 ? it might be time to pack it in			1
the decision to close a site might come suddenly after an acquisition by another company			2
if the purchase is labeled an " aqui - hire " that means the purchasing company is interested in the people on staff , not in the product they 've built			0
of course , a slow , steady drop in popularity can be a solid sign of a site nearing the end			2
if you are the last of your friends using a social network , it might be time to move on before @entity89 shows up			2
save your data a site shutting down can be especially upsetting if you 've invested time in it , become part of a community , or created or uploaded content			1
blog posts , photo libraries , bookmark collections , conversations , messages , friend networks and carefully curated folders of rss feeds will typically disappear with the site			2
most services do the courteous thing and offer a way to save data			2
@entity1 added a way for bloggers to export their sites as @entity115 files before it closed			1
@entity57 has a site dedicated to exporting data from all its various services called @entity120			1
when a major site announces it is closing , competing sites often step up and offer ways to transfer content directly to a new blog , @entity126 , album or other service			1
but not all companies follow these rules			0
when @entity132 shut down @entity16 , the announcement was sudden and the closure immediate			2
there was no way for community members to preserve or download the lively discussion threads that were the heart of the site , and they were n't publicly archived			2
if you have valuable content stored on a site , make periodic backups , even if you think that company will be around forever			1
stay in touch if a site includes a strong community , find other ways to connect with the friends and contacts you 've made once it is offline			1
even when you can export your own data , connections with other people will disappear with the site			1
be sure to connect on e-mail , @entity159 , @entity8 or @entity160			0
you can also reunite on the site you move to next , which is what some @entity163 members did when they migrated to @entity165 , a newer hyper - local community site			2
delete your profile once you 've extracted all the content you need from a dying site , consider hitting the self destruct button on your profile			2
any information left on the service can linger on the internet for years , and personal information might even be sold off to other companies			2
when people abandoned @entity177 for @entity160 's greener pastures , many left behind old profiles adorned with what seemed like hysterical photos at the time			2
now those people are older , perhaps trying to get jobs or dates , and old @entity177 pages still haunt their search results			0
unless you remember your password , getting rid of old profile pages can be difficult			0
find an alternative once you 've been dumped by a favorite website it can be hard to learn how to trust again			0
early adopters are used to constantly signing up for new services that close months or a year later			0
but most people might be hesitant to jump right in and invest time and energy in a new site			0
when you are ready , there are some things to consider when choosing a replacement			0
new startups are still finding their legs and could be bought or go under , but if you do n't mind the uncertainty , they often have some of the most exciting new designs			0
look for sites that offer ways to import your old data , and if you crave stability , for companies that are profitable and still growing			1
there are many good alternatives to @entity1 vying for the attention of the newly homeless bloggers			1
@entity216 is established and dependable , @entity215 is easy and attractive , and newer companies like @entity218 are exciting , but their futures are uncertain			0
if you can wait a bit , two @entity1 co-founders are working on a new project called @entity224			1
they pledge never to sell the company and to keep all urls online no matter what			0
" this one is made to last forever , " reads the site 's tagline			1
forever is a pretty bold promise online			0
make a backup , just in case			0
the gallery above shows some sites that have disappeared over the years			0
what websites would you add to the list ?			0

popular or not , no site 's future is *guaranteed* on the web
blogging platform @entity1 was shut down for good this week by new owner *twitter*
make sure to transfer data , get contact information for online friends
look for an alternative in a site that is both profitable and growing
