@entity0 -- the former chief of the @entity3 who resigned after being charged two years ago with sexually assaulting a maid in a @entity6 hotel has lashed out at his treatment by police -- particularly his forced participation in " the perp walk			1
" " i think it 's a terrible thing , frankly , " @entity11 told @entity1 's @entity12 in his first @entity14 television interview since he resigned as head of the @entity3 in 2011			1
" the problem is , it 's a moment where in all @entity21 , @entity20 society you 're supposed to be innocent , you 're supposed to be innocent until you 're convicted			1
" the economist had been widely expected to become @entity25 's @entity24 presidential candidate -- until his professional career imploded with his may 2011 arrest			1

@entity11 's arraignment was televised and clips played on @entity20 and international networks			1
" @entity38 walks , " in which defendants -- accompanied by police -- walk in front of photographers handcuffed , are standard fare in @entity20			1
underscoring the cultural differences between @entity25 and the @entity20 , many @entity25 recoiled from images of @entity11 being paraded before the news media in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under @entity25 law to protect the presumption of innocence			1
" the perp walk takes place at the moment where you ( are ) supposed to be innocent , " said @entity11 , who calls himself @entity11			2
" you 're just shown to everybody as if you were a criminal , at a moment where nobody knows if it 's true or not -- maybe you 're a criminal , maybe you 're not			2
