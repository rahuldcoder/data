@entity0 if @entity5 leaders can quell conservative dissatisfaction with @entity8 speaker @entity7 , and no further drama comes out from the @entity8 leadership 's no. 3 rep. @entity10 , @entity3 heads hope to get back on track with their aggressive agenda to forcefully confront president @entity14 on the top issues of the day , including the @entity16 , immigration , health care and national security			1
@entity5 believe their legislative plans will sharpen for voters the contrast between the @entity3 and @entity23 , and set the stage for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections			1
" the first thing we need to do is demonstrate we heard what the voters were saying on nov. 4			0
to me , they said we want you to function and we want you to solve problems , " @entity3 senator @entity30 , the number two @entity5 leader , told @entity1			1
@entity5 have a long list of priorities , chief among them unraveling many of the president 's signature policies on energy , health care , the environment , and banking			1
their job wo n't be easy because for any bill to get through the @entity48 , the 54 republicans will need a handful of @entity23 votes			1
@entity5 leaders say they want to put on the floor compromise bills that can bridge the ideological gap between the most conservative members of the @entity3 and a small group of centrist @entity23 who might vote with them			1
in addition , the president is vowing to veto major changes to his signature health care law or the recent immigration reforms he ordered			0
so anything @entity5 hope to get signed into law will have to be negotiated with @entity14 , who they fiercely stood up to during his first six years in office			1
" when the @entity65 people elect divided government , they 're not saying they do n't want anything done , " a collaborative sounding incoming senate majority leader sen. @entity68 recently told @entity1 's @entity69			0
" what they are saying is they want things done in the political center , things that both sides can agree on			0
" in a sign of how important @entity5 are taking their new responsibilities , @entity8 and @entity48 @entity5 will huddle in a rare joint retreat in @entity78 , @entity79 in mid-january to finalize and unite around their strategies for 2015			1
approval of the @entity16 pipeline , which the administration has delayed for years , tops the @entity3 agenda			1
votes are planned on the @entity8 and @entity48 floor during the first two weeks of january			1
@entity3 leaders also plan quick votes on @entity89 and immigration			2
related : @entity14 , @entity91 to test new relationship if they pass , the president would be forced to either accept or reject the bills			0
@entity5 believe they win either way : if he signs them , @entity5 will have accomplishment to point to			2
if he vetoes them , the @entity3 can blame the president for blocking bipartisan bills			1
" hopefully , the president will follow our lead and go in a different direction , " @entity102 said			0
@entity102 has said also he wants to allow @entity23 amendments to @entity3 bills , something @entity5 were denied regularly by @entity23 when they controlled the @entity48			1
in doing so , @entity102 believes he can build good will across the aisle and grow support for individual bills			0
he believes also , strategically , that @entity23 will quickly run through a series of hot - button @entity23 issues -- like bolstering @entity118 regulations and boosting the minimum wage -- that could be more difficult for @entity3 senators running again in swing states to vote on if they took place closer to the election			2
in the @entity8 , @entity7 will have a larger majority -- 246 @entity3 seats -- and aides from both parties expect the speaker will be able to bypass @entity23 push through most legislation with mainly @entity5 votes			1
but because the continued internal tensions between conservatives and those @entity3 members hoping to resolve key policy issues will persist , @entity7 might again need to turn to @entity23 on key spending or fiscal matters			2
" if we did n't have the president we 'd be shuttered off to the side -- we do n't care what you think , " rep @entity141 , the number two @entity8 @entity143 told @entity1			1
while he said he was willing to work with @entity3 leaders , @entity141 said even in the minority democrats would remain relevant in major policy debates because of @entity3 defections , and a key role for @entity23 in the new @entity150 would be to work with the president to sustain any vetoes			1
here is a look at what @entity5 have in the works : @entity16 / energy -- @entity5 say construction of the pipeline is an easy way to create jobs and lessen @entity65 dependence on oil from the @entity163			1
a @entity48 bill fell one vote shy of the 60 needed to overcome a @entity23 filibuster in november			2
@entity5 leaders are confident they can pass it now but acknowledge it 's unlikely they can get 67 votes to override a presidential veto			2
related : @entity48 eyes @entity16 fight economy / jobs -- in 2014 , @entity8 @entity5 passed a series of narrowly focused bills designed to create new jobs			1
many of these rolled back federal regulations on manufacturers , which the @entity3 argued prevented businesses from expanding			2
some passed with bipartisan support but hit a wall in the @entity23 - controlled @entity48			2
now republicans are scheduling new votes on these same bills in both chambers and hope to garner enough support to send them to the president			2
obamacare -- the day after the midterm election @entity7 and @entity102 promised to keep up their effort to repeal @entity89 , which not a single @entity5 voted for when it was enacted			2
they recognize they do n't have the votes to get over a certain presidential veto of a complete repeal so are looking at smaller changes to the law that are supported by bipartisan lawmakers			0
the first week back @entity8 @entity3 leaders scheduled votes on two measures increase the threshold employers have to reach to provide healthcare to workers from 30 to 40 hours per week			1
one @entity3 bill deals narrowly with changing the law to encourage hiring more veterans and another is a broader proposal affecting all businesses			2
votes are likely on doing away with the medical device tax that helps pay for the law			0
there is an internal debate among @entity5 whether to use a special budget tool -- known as " reconciliation " -- that could allow them to pass a repeal in the @entity48 with just 51 votes			1
but because the president has said he will veto that bill , some @entity5 want to save reconciliation , which can only be used once , for another priority , like tax reform , entitlement changes , or energy policy			1
immigration : @entity7 vowed he would fight " tooth and nail " to reverse the president 's executive actions , enacted in november , to allow roughly 5 million undocumented workers to remain in the @entity65 funding for the @entity238 runs out at the end of february			0
late last year , @entity5 would only agree to fund the agency , which needs to carry out the immigration orders , until then because they want to try to force the president to reverse course			1
the standoff has the risk of shuttering the department , which responds to terrorism , natural disasters and other politically - sensitive matters			0
@entity5 are readying action on this issue soon -- likely in the @entity8 in the second week of january			1
tax reform : members have both parties have stressed they want to simplify the tax code , but a major impasse has prevented progress			0
@entity5 oppose measures that could be characterized as a tax hike			2
@entity23 want to expand current tax breaks such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit , but some in the @entity3 argue these are abused by undocumented workers			0
democrats also want to close loopholes for corporations , which @entity5 oppose			0
foreign policy and @entity269 : @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 likely will dominate the agenda			0
republicans are vowing to push back on the president 's executive actions to restore diplomatic relations with @entity270 but are n't settled on a strategy yet on how to do it			0
they also oppose his negotiations with @entity271 over that nation 's nuclear program and may quickly call a vote on a bipartisan bill to increase sanctions on @entity271			0
that could upset the delicate multinational talks that were recently extended			0
@entity150 is expected to act early in 2015 on a new use of force authorization against @entity293 fighters in @entity272 and @entity273			0
that debate will focus on how much latitude to give the @entity8 and whether to restrict the use of ground troops as many democrats want			0
@entity300 / @entity299 : @entity5 - led investigations will continue into whether the @entity300 unfairly targeted conservative groups and whether the administration covered up its handling of the @entity299 attacks			0
@entity23 complain both investigations are politically motivated and should be ended			0
trade / infrastructure : republicans will likely advance trade bills that were opposed by many @entity8 and @entity48 @entity23			1
new spending for upgrading the nation 's roads and bridges in another area where both parties could cobble together a bipartisan vote			0
@entity102 told @entity1 in december , " we have certainly a lot of bipartisan interest in the crumbling infrastructure in the country and what to do about it			0

@entity5 are eager to shake off past *scandals* and seize control of both chambers of @entity150
top agenda items for the @entity3 include : approving the @entity16 pipeline expansion and confronting the president
