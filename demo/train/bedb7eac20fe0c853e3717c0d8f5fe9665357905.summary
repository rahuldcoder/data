after a decade of construction and almost four years behind schedule , the @entity1 's latest airport destination began full operations earlier this week			1
@entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , will eventually occupy 29 square kilometers ( roughly a third of the size of @entity6 city itself ) and comes in at a total cost of $ 15 billion			1
the giant facility will have an annual capacity of 50 million passengers as well as public spaces for art exhibitions , a vip terminal inspired by @entity18 sailboats and an aquatic themed mosque			0
like an increasing number of oil and gas rich cities in the region , @entity6 is attempting to diversify its economy to make the most of new trade and tourism opportunities			1
for the head of @entity7 's ambitious national carrier , the much - awaited development could n't have come soon enough			1
" it gives us unlimited opportunities , " @entity33 ceo , @entity32 told @entity34			0
" @entity36 was very congested			0
we could not give the standard of service we would prefer our passengers to have on the ground			0
" analysts say @entity6 , like its @entity44 neighbors , understands the power and potential of aviation to provide a stable long - term industry in the region			1
" there 's a recognition by the ( @entity7 ) government that aviation plays a wider economic role which does n't only directly support jobs , " said @entity50 , director of aviation analytics firm @entity51			1
" it ( also ) supports trade , it supports stability to develop tourism and we 've seen that that 's been done very effectively for example in @entity64 , " @entity50 added			2
@entity64 opened the doors of its second airport , the mammoth @entity67 , just last year			2
there are already plans to increase annual capacity there from the 120 million agreed upon during the initial design phase to over 200 million			0
" ultimately we want to create the world 's largest airport , " said @entity72 , ceo of @entity73			2
" the current largest airport in the world in @entity78 , @entity79 , is about 89 million passengers so you can see the kind of scale and order we are looking at , " @entity72 added			0
in @entity85 , meanwhile , construction is underway for the new @entity86 at @entity87			0
set to open in 2017 , it will have a capacity of 30 million passengers per year alone			0
such massive developments ensure competition in the region is stiff			0
but with so much capacity will there be enough tourism and trade to go around ? that remains to be seen , but regional airlines seem convinced and are operating to ambitious expansion schedules themselves			2
" step by step we 're opening up the @entity104 but we 're also going to balance that with more cities in @entity109 ( and ) in the @entity1 , " said @entity106 ceo of @entity85 carrier , @entity107			2
according to the @entity110 , @entity107 and the other @entity1 carriers are currently gaining more passengers than any other region			1
in the first quarter of this year @entity114 ( a separate facility to @entity67 ) became the busiest in the world with more than 18 million passengers , overtaking 16 million at @entity119 's @entity118			0
on top of this , many analysts believe the @entity44 hubs -- situated just 8 hours flying time from two - thirds of the world 's population -- are well placed to tap into many new and emerging markets in @entity109 and @entity128			1
" i do n't think the big hub airports in the @entity44 are particularly competing with each other , they are more competing with other parts of the world , " said @entity50			2
" the @entity44 is positioned between growing markets in @entity109 , @entity128 and @entity134 and the airlines who operate out of these hub airports have very long range modern aircraft			1
" many other airlines in other parts of the world are simply not equipped ...			0
so , these airports should be able to grow @entity142 , " @entity50 added			0
if that 's the case , all that 's left is for the @entity44 carriers to grab a piece of the lucrative aviation pie in the skies			1

@entity7 's *sparkling* new airport is one of a series of ambitious aviation projects in the @entity44
countries in region looking to diversify economies to take *advantage* of location between east and west
@entity1 carriers growing faster than airlines in other regions , says @entity110
