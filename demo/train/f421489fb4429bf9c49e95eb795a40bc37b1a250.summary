@entity0 -- it 's mid-june , a perfect time to visit the beach to watch porpoises play in the surf or seagulls strut the sand -- or you could watch a formation of @entity12 warplanes darting over the shore at hundreds of miles per hour			2
but do n't worry -- the @entity14 has n't declared war on your family 's beach house			0
it 's just part of a major @entity12 exercise called @entity21 ( translation : armored fist )			1
the exercise is designed to test the capability of every type of @entity12 aircraft , including @entity29 @entity28 and @entity30 , as well as some @entity32 ships and @entity34 planes			1
the drill will stretch from @entity36 in northern @entity37 to the @entity32 's @entity38 in @entity39			1
with thousands of @entity12 and other service members involved , it 's the biggest such drill ever on the @entity14 @entity42			1
" exercise mailed fist is the first exercise of its specific kind and the largest @entity50 exercise conducted in recent history , " said staff sgt. @entity43 , @entity12 spokesman			1
" in the past , @entity50 units had to deploy to the @entity53 to conduct this type of training			0
" mailed fist was not originally supposed to be one big exercise			0
but the @entity50 's commander , maj. gen. @entity57 , decided to combine several smaller drills into one big exercise			0
not only do the @entity12 train closer to home , the @entity59 saves money			2
most of the exercises will take place in the skies above or near @entity12 bases along the @entity68 and @entity69 coast			0
from monday until friday , vacationers " who are located near the bases ... will see an increase in air and ground traffic at various times throughout the week , but there should be minimal impact on activity near beaches other than occasional fly - overs at relatively high altitudes , " the spokesman said .			0
