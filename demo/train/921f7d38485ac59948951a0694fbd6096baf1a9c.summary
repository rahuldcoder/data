-- a lawyer for former @entity3 president @entity2 scoffed monday at a @entity5 government warning that his client 's planned return to @entity3 from @entity8 could disrupt elections scheduled for sunday			1
" the @entity5 government has done everything they can to keep him halfway around the world , " said @entity10 , @entity2 's longtime , @entity12 - based lawyer			1
" for them to issue this ridiculous statement that it was voluntary and that he voluntarily stayed in @entity8 is pure fiction			0
he 's been trying to come back for seven years			0
" @entity10 was referring to a comment made by @entity21 spokesman @entity20 , who said monday , " mr. @entity2 has chosen to remain outside of @entity3 for seven years			2
to return this week can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact @entity3 's elections			0
... return prior to the election may potentially be destabilizing to the political process			0
" @entity10 said @entity2 , @entity3 's first democratically elected president , is planning to return before sunday 's elections , though he said he did not know when			1
@entity2 has long said that he was removed from @entity3 in 2004 aboard a @entity29 plane in a coup carried out by the @entity5 government			2
@entity5 authorities have said they were seeking to prevent him from being violently overthrown by domestic unrest			0
since then , @entity2 has been trying to return to @entity3 to work in education , @entity10 said			0
he particularly wants to return prior to the election so that any new government will not have the opportunity to keep him out , something he said the @entity5 government would support			2
" the @entity5 government is very involved in keeping @entity2 out and trying to shepherd in a right - wing government , " the lawyer said			1
since 2004 , @entity2 has been teaching in @entity8 and trying to arrange for his return to @entity3 , his lawyer said			2
in february , he received a new @entity3 passport			0
but the lawyer conceded that @entity2 's return would draw attention away from the current list of presidential candidates			1
" it 's clear that the candidates now running for office have very low popularity among the @entity3 people and the @entity5 does n't want a figure as popular as @entity2 coming back , " @entity10 said			1
" he 's a populist and represents the aspirations of the @entity3 people and ( @entity5 government officials ) are , i think , afraid that those aspirations may not be consistent with the interests of supporting the elite in @entity3			0
" @entity20 said that the @entity3 constitution gives @entity2 the right to return and that the decision to allow that is in the hands of the @entity3 government			0
" we would urge former president @entity2 to delay his return until after the electoral process has concluded to permit the @entity3 people to cast their ballots in a peaceful atmosphere , " @entity20 told reporters at a @entity21 briefing unrelated to @entity3			1
and the @entity21 spokesman asked @entity8 , where @entity2 and his family have lived since he left @entity3 voluntarily in 2004 , to also make the case against his return			1
" we encourage the @entity8 government as a committed partner to @entity3 's stability to urge former president @entity2 to delay his return until after the elections , " @entity20 said			1
