@entity1 it 's an unusually cold december evening in @entity1			1
at this particular running track , only a few dedicated runners are braving the frigid temperatures -- a couple of high - school sprinters , an old man shuffling along , a middle - aged man who just changed out of his suit and tie for a post-work run			2
among this cluster of fitness enthusiasts are the @entity14 -- all of them dressed in black uniforms , running together , completely in sync			2
from afar , any ordinary bystander would never have guessed that the @entity14 are in fact made up of blind runners paired up with deaf runners and a few " guide runners " who help ensure the team stays on track			1
formed just four years ago , this remarkable running team of almost 60 runners has already competed in marathons around the world including @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity33 's @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity35 in addition to local @entity1 races			1
" the major objective of the @entity14 is to raise the public awareness of persons with specific needs , " says @entity38 , founder of the running team			1
" we want to provide a platform for people with disability to realize their potential			0
" @entity38 completely lost his own vision when he was 13			1
in 1999 , one of @entity38 's closest friends who was also completely blind committed suicide because of immense feelings of social isolation and discrimination			1
" i said to myself , one day i will do something for the community and do my best to allow disabled persons to live a fulfilled life			0
" back then , those with disabilities could hardly rely on the government to help them integrate into society			0
" in 1980s or early 1990s , the @entity65 was not even established , " explains @entity38			2
furthermore , people with disabilities were only allowed to complete form 3 level of education			0
" only those who came first or elite students were admitted to normal schools			0
" fortunately , after the government signed the @entity73 , things have changed for the better over the years and there have been many efforts ever since to create a barrier - free environment			0
however , one area of improvement remains : there is little support for the children of parents with disabilities who may not have any disabilities themselves			0
" it leads to a vicious cycle of poverty , " says @entity38			2
the @entity14 team is part of @entity38 's larger initiative called the @entity92 for the @entity93 that -- among its many other programs -- has set up an education fund for those children			1
the team runs races to raise money for this fund that in turn helps counsel the children and provides them with appropriate home tutors when necessary .			0

in @entity1 , there 's something a little different about running team @entity14
*members* of the group are either blind or deaf , and have competed in marathons worldwide
@entity14 is now made up of almost 60 runners , and was founded by @entity38 , who lost his vision aged 13
