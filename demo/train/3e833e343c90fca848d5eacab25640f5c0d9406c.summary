he 's accused of plotting with his brother and carrying out an attack near the finish line of the @entity5 that killed three people , wounded more than 260 and spurred a massive manhunt that terrorized the city for days			0
and now , nearly 19 months after the bombings , @entity10 's trial is starting			1
here are 13 things to keep in mind as the proceedings get under way this week at the federal courthouse in @entity17 : 1			0
it 's going to take time to pick a jury			2
lawyers have more than 1,000 people to choose from			0
about 1,200 potential jurors have been summoned , @entity1 affiliate @entity23 reported			0
the prosecution and defense will have to pare down that pool to 12 jurors and six alternates			0
prosecutors have said the trial could last up to four months			2
we already have some clues about the arguments on both sides			0
court documents filed so far by the defense and prosecution paint a pretty clear picture of where things are heading -- though their portrayals of @entity10 , 21 , are dramatically different			2
prosecutors cast him as a deliberate killer inspired by jihadist literature			0
the defense has tried to pin the blame on @entity48 , describing @entity10 as a youngster manipulated by his older brother , who " was an all - powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed			2
" @entity48 , 26 , was killed in a confrontation with police days after the bombing			0
police surrounded @entity10 two days later as he hid inside a boat in a backyard in @entity59 , @entity60			2
he surrendered with rifle lasers tagging his head			0
@entity10 faces 30 federal charges			1
he has pleaded not guilty to all of them , including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death			0
in addition to accusations tied to the two pressure cooker bombs that blew up at the marathon , the indictment against @entity10 also alleges that he and his brother killed a @entity75 police officer by shooting him in the head at close range			2
it 's a capital case , even though @entity60 abolished the death penalty			1
@entity60 got rid of the death penalty three decades ago , but this is not a state case			1
federal prosecutors can seek the death penalty against @entity10 because of the nature of the crimes he 's accused of committing			1
federal prosecutors say he acted in " an especially heinous , cruel and depraved manner " and lacks remorse			1
this is n't the prosecutor 's first time tackling a prominent case			0
in 2011 , the @entity92 named @entity94 attorney @entity93 " @entity101 " for prosecuting corrupt politicians , winning a terrorism case against an @entity98 supporter and pushing the prosecution of notorious mob boss @entity100			0
when @entity100 was sentenced in 2013 to two life terms plus five years in prison , @entity102 did n't mince words , describing him as a terrorist driven by " his desire for power , for greed and ambition			0
@entity10 's lawyer is known for representing high - profile clients in death penalty cases			1
her name is @entity116 , and you 've seen her before			0
the federal public defender represented " @entity119 " @entity119 and @entity120 , the gunman who seriously wounded former @entity94 rep. @entity122 and killed six people at a meet - and - greet for the congresswoman			0
an ardent opponent of the death penalty , she has kept some of the nation 's most despised criminals -- baby killers , bombers , white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row			1
prosecutors and defense attorneys talked about a possible plea deal for @entity10 , but it did n't work out			1
several of @entity140 's most notorious clients have pleaded guilty and avoided the death penalty			1
@entity119 and @entity120 both faced capital charges but are now serving life sentences in prison			0
in @entity10 's case , discussions in recent months have centered on the possibility of him pleading guilty and receiving a life sentence without parole			1
the talks have reached an impasse because the @entity153 has resisted removing the death penalty as a possibility , officials told @entity1			1
some people in @entity17 want to see a deal like that for @entity10			2
in an opinion column published in the @entity92 earlier this month , a retired federal judge , a former prosecutor and another lawyer argue that a trial and the media frenzy surrounding it will needlessly force victims to relive the horrors of the bombing			2
" let 's write a last chapter that guarantees just punishment for @entity10 while putting the victims and the community at the center of the legal system 's concerns , " @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 wrote			1
others want him to get the death penalty			1
when federal prosecutors announced last year that @entity94 attorney general @entity187 had decided to seek the death penalty against @entity10 , a number of victims and their family members said it was a step in the right direction			1
@entity190 , who lost a leg in the bombing , told @entity23 he has no doubt about where he stands			0

" and i strongly believe that 's how it should be			0
@entity10 's lawyer tried to get the case moved out of @entity17			1
the judge said no. so did a federal appeals court			0
@entity140 argued that @entity10 could n't get a fair trial there			1
federal prosecutors argued that changing the location of the trial would deny victims a chance to see justice carried out			1
experts are split on how the location could influence whether @entity10 is sentenced to death			2
on the one hand , @entity17 is a liberal city where opposition to the death penalty is widespread , @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity217 said			1
on the other hand , because it 's a federal case , the jury will be drawn from a broader pool that could include more conservative suburban or rural residents who are more inclined to support executions , @entity222 lawyer @entity221 , a leading expert on capital cases , told @entity1 last year			2
in a 2013 @entity92 poll , 57 % of @entity17 respondents supported a life sentence for @entity10			0
thirty - three percent favored the death penalty			1
it 's unknown whether @entity10 will testify			2
at a hearing last month , he appeared in court , telling a judge that he was satisfied with his defense lawyers			0
they told the @entity92 that they 're prepared to take the stand			0
even if @entity10 is found guilty , that 's not the end of the trial			1
since @entity10 's trial is a capital case , there will be a separate court proceeding on whether he should get the death penalty if the federal jury finds him guilty			1
that phase , @entity217 says , would be like a " small , separate mini trial			0
" @entity1 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			0
