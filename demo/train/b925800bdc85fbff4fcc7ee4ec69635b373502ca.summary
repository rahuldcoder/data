@entity0 -- president @entity2 called thursday for high - level talks with republicans to work out a compromise on health care legislation , then putting the resulting bill to a vote in @entity9			1
" if @entity9 decides we 're not going to do it , even after all the facts are laid out , after all the options are clear , then the @entity11 people can make a judgment as to whether this @entity9 has done the right thing for them or not , " @entity2 said			2
" that 's how democracy works			0
" @entity2 's comments were the first clear signal from the @entity21 or @entity22 in @entity9 on how they would proceed on a top legislative priority after losing their 60 - seat super-majority in the @entity27			1
@entity4 @entity28 was sworn in as the new @entity11 senator from @entity30 earlier thursday , leaving the @entity22 one vote shy of being able to overcome @entity4 filibusters of health care reform and other major initiatives			1
asked at a party fund - raising event about the @entity22 strategy for health care reform going forward , @entity2 said @entity22 leaders in the @entity21 and @entity27 were working out differences in the separate health care bills passed by each chamber last year			1
once that was finished , @entity2 said , the next step would be " to call on our @entity4 friends to present their ideas			1
" " what i 'd like to do is to have a meeting whereby i 'm sitting with the @entity4 , sitting with the @entity22 , sitting with health care experts , and let 's just go through these bills -- their ideas , our ideas -- and walk through them and in a methodical way so that the @entity11 people can see and compare , " @entity2 said			1
" and then i think we 've got to go ahead and move forward on a vote , " he added			0
" we 've got to move forward on a vote			0
" a @entity21 official acknowledged later thursday that this was new language from @entity2 to offer a possible scenario for health care talks to move forward			2
however , the official stressed it was " not a new strategy " for the @entity21 to coalesce behind , and aides were still mulling various options to complete action on health care legislation			0
@entity68 leaders in @entity9 have struggled to come up with a consensus strategy since the party lost its super-majority in the @entity27			2
@entity4 have unanimously opposed the health care bills so far , meaning @entity22 would be unable to pass a bill through the @entity27 because of a certain @entity4 filibuster			1
@entity28 , now the 41st @entity4 senator to give the @entity4 its unstoppable filibuster ability , said thursday after his swearing - in that @entity9 should start over on the health care issue instead of continuing to work on existing proposals			1
@entity4 complain the comprehensive @entity22 health care bills would lead to a government takeover of health care			1
they call for smaller steps focused on individual issues , such as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits			0
democrats , however , say that spiraling health care costs that threaten the nation 's future economic stability can only be addressed through comprehensive reform			0
@entity2 said thursday the @entity22 bill that will emerge from the @entity27 talks on joining their two proposals would expand coverage to at least 30 million @entity11 who lack health insurance while reducing long - term health care costs			1
the measure would include an insurance exchange to allow people and small business owners to pool together to purchase coverage , @entity2 said , but he made no mention of a government - run public health insurance option that @entity4 have rallied against			2
@entity2 said the @entity22 bill would include reforms that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or capping lifetime benefits			1
" and by the way , all of it is paid for , " @entity2 said			0
" not only is it deficit - neutral , but the @entity114 , which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for much things cost in @entity9 , says it is going to reduce the costs by $ 1 trillion			0
" @entity2 called health care reform the " single best way to bring down our deficits , " adding " nobody has disputed that			0
" " nobody can dispute the fact that if we do n't tackle surging health care costs , then we ca n't control our budget , " he said			0
while democrats from both chambers have been working together to merge their two bills , alternative strategies also have been discussed			2
house speaker @entity132 said this week that the chamber would vote next week on one provision of its health care bill , which would drop the current anti-trust exemption for the insurance industry that allows practices such as market allocation			0
the @entity27 bill would maintain the anti-trust exemption , so it was unclear whether the @entity21 's limited first step would win approval there			1
however , @entity22 aides have said that @entity21 @entity22 want to keep momentum on health care going in coming weeks			2
@entity1 's @entity148 contributed to this story .			0
