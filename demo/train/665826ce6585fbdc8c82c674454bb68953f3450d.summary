@entity0 , @entity1 -- bruised by the embarrassing 2 inches of snow that crippled @entity0 two weeks ago , the city rallied this week to make sure a repeat was n't in store			1
here are five reasons @entity0 is not a laughingstock -- this time : 1			1
people actually listened i 'll be damned			2
the most historic thing about the storm was people 's response : folks heeded the warnings and stayed home			1
i did n't think this was possible , until this week			2
southern pride if there 's anything @entity24 love , it 's unleashing a can of whupass			1
atlantans and @entity28 are resilient folks			2
we saw the viral posts about @entity32 and heard the punch lines			2
we were determined to do better this time			2
so take that , critics			2
@entity36 , is that egg on your face or grits ? 3			0
a most awesome robocall in my 19 years in @entity0 , never before have i received a call from the mayor 's office announcing a state of emergency			1
but mayor @entity47 did just that tuesday night , urging hundreds of thousands of @entity48 to remain inside ahead of wednesday 's storm and to stay off the roads			1
that 's what i call a @entity53			2
whether it was to scare us or save political face from two weeks ago , its intended effect resulted in people not venturing outside			1
this is not to exonerate the mayor and gov. @entity61 for their missteps two weeks ago			1
they blew it during @entity32 , pointing fingers and appearing to play politics while thousands were stranded on the highways of metro @entity0			1
in an interview with @entity2 , the mayor had seemed clueless at residents ' angst over his handling of the storm			1
" i do n't think people are mad at me , " he told @entity2			0
but too many times we excoriate leaders -- often rightfully so -- but do n't credit them when they learn a lesson			0
it was clear mayor @entity47 and @entity82 learned from the mistakes of two weeks ago			1
for his part , @entity61 was out front early on , urging residents to use caution and be prepared			2
the two leaders were n't going to let the region become the butt of late - night jokes and viral internet posts again			0
admit it : those meteorologists are pretty good ok , my generation of @entity24 grew up in an era when winter storm predictions stunk			2
forecasters would predict 4 inches of snow and , as kids , we 'd ditch homework , drink hot cocoa and stay up late looking out our windows			0
once every few years , we 'd awake to an inch of snow			0
this makes for a skeptical bunch			0
fast forward to today : throw into the mix local news reporters who stand outside while nothing is happening and scream from the tv as dire music plays : @entity114 ! this lends itself to eyeball rolling			0
and i imagine this played a major role in @entity32			0
from officials on high to gritty workers , we collectively yawned -- until we all ran out the door at work at the same time			0
these days , armed with new - fangled tracking methods , the meteorologists have been spot on			0
they predicted the storm of two weeks ago with precision and did so again			1
granted , the warnings from the @entity131 of a catastrophic and historic storm -- repeated by every news outlet -- turned out to be over-the - top			1
it packed a powerful punch , for sure , but nothing too alarming			0
nothing any @entity139 city would n't just take in stride			0
we did n't ' pull an @entity0 ' yes , @entity142 had actually coined a new term			1
@entity145 truck crews in the @entity146 last week repeatedly told reporters they were out early to de-ice roads because they " were n't gon na pull an @entity0			1
" and this time , by golly , @entity0 did n't pull an @entity0 either			1
( apparently the crews in @entity151 were not notified of this term			0
@entity0 has plenty of reasons to be a laughingstock			1
congested roads , weird political dynamics and far too few @entity159 titles ( not to mention a lack of @entity162 titles and @entity164 victories )			2
but we do have a thriving economy , tons of green space and friendly people in a world - class city			0
i spent wednesday embedded with @entity0 firefighters at @entity172 , @entity173			1
the collective effort by citizens and local leaders made for a boring day			0
there were no heroic rescues			0
this made for a restless bunch			0
as one put it : " when 's that biblical , catastrophic storm gon na get here ? " to be clear , this storm was far worse than the one two weeks ago			1
more than 350,000 @entity28 were without power at its peak , and at least two deaths were attributed to the weather			0
it was serious business in small pockets			0
but because most folks stayed inside , it had the feel of a dud			0
" that 's the way we like it , " said fire sgt. @entity196			2
if this was a catastrophic storm , i hope i live in @entity0 when the apocalypse hits .			1

@entity1 's *governor* , @entity0 's mayor learned lessons from 2 weeks ago
residents decided to heed warnings
storm was worse , but roads were clear
