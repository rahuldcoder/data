-- monday is the second day of the year , which means millions of @entity2 have started new diets			1
they resolved to lose weight , get in shape , and they are starting strong			2
sadly , the odds are that almost all of these resolutions will soon be broken and abandoned			2
close to half of all dieters end up heavier than ever			2
virtually none will lose weight permanently			2
the same is true for the country as a whole			2
obesity has become the country 's leading public health problem			1
yet as we talk and talk about the issue , the country only becomes fatter and fatter			1
the problem for the country echoes the problem for individuals : willpower is not enough			1
" ( it 's a ) basic instinct , even stronger than the sexual instinct , to store calories to survive the next period of starvation			0
and we live in an environment where there 's food every half mile			0
it 's tasty , cheap , convenient , and you can eat it with one hand			1
" thus says @entity39 of the @entity40 at @entity41 in @entity42 , author of one of the many studies on the limits of dieting , quoted in @entity48			0
if you as an individual want to change your weight , you must change your whole life			1
likewise , to reduce obesity in modern society , we will have to alter the way society is organized			1
weight gain is driven by two trends : increases in calories consumed and decrease in calories expended			0
for example : the after - inflation cost of sugary soda has declined by an estimated 48 % over the past 20 years			0
correspondingly , consumption of sugary soda has soared : sugary soda is now the single most important source of calories in the @entity2 diet			1
for example again : the number of @entity2 who work at physically taxing jobs continues its steady decline			1
even those jobs that demand physical labor -- manufacturing , for example -- are much less grueling than they used to be , as electrically powered machines do the lifting and shifting that used to consume human energy			0
while @entity2 expend fewer calories at work , they spend more time in cars -- almost twice as much as in the 1970s			1
they spend 26 hours per week consuming tv or online entertainment			0
americans could theoretically compensate for more sedentary lifestyles by stepping up their recreational exercise -- but only about 20 % of @entity2 bother			1
some 80 % never do -- including presumably all those failed dieters			0
want to change this ? it 's no small project			0
it would involve the redesign of cities , the relocation of schools , the reinvention of our modes of eating and amusement			0
first lady @entity104 has made healthy eating her special project			1
good for her , and let 's hope her efforts lead to success			0
but if we are to succeed , we should understand : the campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking ( which involves just one decision , to smoke or not to smoke ) and much more like the generation - long campaign against highway fatalities , which required the redesign of cars , the redesign of highways , and changes in personal behavior like seat - belt use and drunk driving			2
the good news is that the campaign against highway fatalities has yielded real progress : down two - thirds since the mid- 1960s			0
the bad news is that , for most of us , it will take more than a @entity134 's resolution			0
however , if you are seriously resolved , congratulations -- and see you on the jogging path			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			1

@entity140 says @entity2 eat more , exercise less than in earlier generations
he says obesity is *no.* 1 health problem , *extremely* *difficult* to reverse
@entity104 is to be commended for taking on the issue , he says
@entity150 : to solve it will take major changes in the @entity2 way of life
