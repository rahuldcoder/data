@entity0 -- a year ago , @entity2 was an idealistic 19 - year - old revolutionary who sang about freedom			0
always dressed in a scarf and fingerless gloves woven with the colors of the @entity8 rebel flag , @entity2 worked with a team of pro-democracy activists in @entity8 's northern @entity12 province			1
he would sing from the rooftops during boisterous anti-government protests , complete with humorous animations that begged the international community to help stop @entity8 government atrocities			2
but today , @entity2 appears much different in a series of @entity20 videos			0
gone is the scarf with colors of the rebel flag			0
instead of leading the chants , the young man stands in the crowd smiling as one man sings , " we destroyed @entity30 with a civilian plane , turned the @entity32 into a pile of dirt			2
if you call me a terrorist , i say it 's an honor			2
" in another video , @entity2 stands cheering with a crowd of bearded men as a little boy sings , " our commander is @entity43			0
he showed the @entity30 the strength of our faith			2
" a man gives the boy a knife , which he proceeds to slice through the air as he sings , " our police is @entity51			2
we will come to slaughter you			0
" it was a chilling warning to the minority religious sect of @entity8 president @entity56 , who has stacked the top ranks of his security forces with fellow @entity52			2
@entity2 declined several requests to speak with @entity1			0
several of his friends , however , confirmed that he is now a member of @entity51 , or the @entity51 , the most famous of the hard - line @entity62 rebel groups now fighting against the @entity8 regime			1
@entity2 's ideological evolution is symbolic of a broader shift that many @entity8 say they 're seeing nearly two years after the anti-government uprising began			1
" there is an increasing militarization and now increased radicalization of the revolution , " said @entity67			0
she is the @entity72 spokeswoman for the @entity73 in @entity8 , one of the first groups to organize peaceful anti-government protests in the spring of 2011			1
" @entity51 continues to make gains , " @entity67 said			2
" they continue to increase in popularity , particularly as they begin to implement social services			1
" in the last year , the @entity51 has grown from a shadowy group claiming responsibility for deadly car bombs to what @entity8 describe as a highly disciplined fighting force that continues to attract recruits from the more secular @entity89 rebels			1
@entity51 fighters are said to be leading the ongoing siege of the @entity93 military airbase in @entity95 province			2
they are also credited with helping lead the capture of the @entity98 airbase in @entity12 province last month			0
opinion : terrorist group fills power vacuum among @entity8 rebels the high - profile @entity62 victories on the battlefield have been accompanied by another trend			1
gradually , black @entity62 banners have replaced the distinctive green , black , white and red flags of the @entity8 rebels at weekly anti-government protests			1
" after two years of killings and butchering and the entire world standing by and watching us , now we depend on @entity116 only			0
so we started raising the banner of @entity121 , the black banner of war , " explained a @entity8 activist who has spent much of the last two years organizing anti-government protests in @entity12 province			2
the @entity121 refers to the @entity126 creed " there is no god but @entity116 , @entity124 is the messenger of @entity116			0
" it is one of the most important pillars of @entity126			0
it is also invoked for martyrdom on the battlefield			0
the rapid rise of hard - line @entity137 groups like the @entity51 -- some of which have seen their ranks swelled by foreign jihadi fighters -- is a trend that makes @entity67 and other more secular revolutionaries deeply uncomfortable			1
it is also making @entity145 uneasy			0
in december , the @entity30 government blacklisted the @entity51 , labeling it a terrorist organization			1
" we blacklisted the @entity51 because of its intimate links with @entity152 ... which is responsible for the killing of thousands of @entity154 and hundreds of @entity30 , " said @entity148 , the @entity30 ambassador to @entity8 , in an interview with @entity1 last month			1
" we know what @entity152 in @entity154 did and is still doing , and we do n't want it to start doing that in @entity8			2
" but some @entity8 opposition leaders blame @entity159 inaction for the recent growth of the @entity62 groups			1
" the @entity30 and the @entity164 did n't help us , and that created an increase in @entity126 radicalism here , " said @entity162 in an interview in @entity95 last month			2
@entity162 was a judge who defected from the @entity8 government and helped launch the @entity170 , an opposition - run court that is trying to institute law and order in rebel - controlled parts of @entity95			1
like many in the opposition , @entity162 has viewed @entity62 groups like @entity178 as uneasy partners in the campaign to overthrow the @entity56 regime			1
" they are our brothers in the revolution			0
but we differ on how to build the state , " explained @entity162 , who now serves as the chief prosecutor for the @entity170			0
" we call for a civil , democratic nation			0
they call for an @entity126 state			0
" @entity30 branding of @entity51 may have unintended consequences members of the @entity51 declined to meet face to face with @entity1 journalists			1
instead , @entity197 , the spokesman for the @entity51 in @entity95 , answered several questions submitted in print			2
he wrote that the main object of the group in @entity8 was " to establish an @entity126 state that can be based on the principles of the shura ( consultations ) where righteousness and justice will prevail based on applying @entity116 's laws			1
" " we already started carrying out @entity116 's law in some of the liberated areas , " @entity197 added			0
" and we noted a great reception among the people when it comes to these religious courts , especially when they discovered that these courts were not as some portrayed and tried to distort their reality that such a court system will enslave them and that their heads will be severed and that their only salvation is when they choose a secular @entity159 - oriented system that can rule among them			1
" competition between the @entity170 and courts backed by the @entity51 exploded this month			2
on tuesday , the council accused @entity51 fighters of raiding one of its courthouses in @entity95			0
" @entity51 stormed the @entity236 and seized the building of the @entity170 and attacked scholars and judges who were there and they beat them and insulted them and then they kidnapped them to @entity51 's headquarters , " said the council in a written statement also signed by a group calling itself the @entity235			1
rebel court fills void amid @entity8 war it is not the first time tensions have flared between the @entity51 and other revolutionaries			1
one of @entity95 's most famous anti-government activists , a man known as @entity249 , told @entity1 he was briefly detained and flogged by @entity62 fighters last week			1
after his release , @entity251 posted a photo on @entity254 of his bruised back			0
" they accused me of protesting against the caliphate , " @entity251 said in a brief interview with @entity1			0
asked whether he thought the @entity51 was taking over @entity8 's uprising , @entity251 said , " yes , of course , that 's true , but it 's all because of the mistakes of the @entity89			1
" nearly two years into the uprising , the rebel @entity89 continues to be dogged by accusations of corruption			0
in recent weeks , activists have mounted an online campaign accusing @entity269 , a prominent commander based in @entity95 , of banditry and kidnapping			0
@entity269 has denied the charges			0
but last week , a detachment of @entity269 's fighters raided the offices of the @entity276			0
they briefly detained several @entity8 journalists who had published reports that @entity269 's brigade had killed an innocent civilian			1
meanwhile , @entity62 groups like the @entity51 have been applauded for distributing food and fuel to hungry , freezing @entity8			1
the @entity51 also launched a cheap public service in rebel - controlled parts of @entity95			1
" not only do they do the fighting , but they also perform a lot of civil duties such as cleaning roads , manning bakeries , installing and repairing city infrastructure like electricity , " said the activist from @entity12 province , who asked not to be named			0
" some of the @entity51 members are now playing even the role of street cleaners because of garbage in the city that has increased the rat population			0
" even @entity8 who criticize the @entity51 concede the @entity126 have offered hope to some members of a society traumatized by a brutal conflict that has claimed more than 70,000 lives and left millions of people homeless			1
as @entity126 within the uprising continue to attract support , leaders of the @entity89 have been left fuming , blaming a lack of @entity159 engagement for the ideological shift in the uprising			1
" we see the @entity62 factions gaining more ground , recruiting some of our own people , " said @entity319 , a spokesman for the @entity89			1
" the world is handing @entity8 over to the unknown , to the radicals , to the @entity126			0

hard - line @entity62 groups like the @entity51 are becoming more popular in @entity8
they 're fighting the @entity8 regime while providing social services for @entity8 civilians
some *attribute* their rise to @entity159 *indifference* and a @entity89 that 's lacking
the @entity30 blacklisted the @entity51 in december , labeled it terrorist
