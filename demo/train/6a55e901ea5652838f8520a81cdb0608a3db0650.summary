-- @entity1 and @entity2 are two @entity4 men in their 20s			1
they 're both fascinated by -- and adept at -- computer use and held jobs that gave them access to some of their country 's most secret and sensitive intelligence			1
they chose to share that material with the world and are now paying for it			2
but that may be where the similarities end			0
what did they do ? @entity23 pvt. @entity1 leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents about the wars in @entity26 and @entity27 and sensitive correspondence written by @entity4 diplomats -- information that @entity31 published			1
some of that information was also analyzed and reported by @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity36 newspapers as well as other news outlets			0
a military judge acquitted @entity1 on tuesday of aiding the enemy , but convicted him of violations of the @entity41			1
the proceedings for his sentencing could take days or even weeks			0
he could get 136 years			0
@entity2 , a former @entity45 employee and @entity47 contract employee , told a @entity36 journalist that the @entity47 was operating classified surveillance programs that track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and internet traffic of virtually all @entity4			1
to tell his story , he left his job and life in @entity56 , fled to @entity57 and is now in @entity58 , where he has been granted temporary asylum			0

@entity2 worked for @entity47 contract firm @entity69 , a job that gave him access to the sensitive programs			1
what are their stated motives ? when @entity1 entered his guilty pleas on certain charges in february , he spent more than an hour in court reading a statement about why he had leaked the information			1
he said that the information he passed " upset " or " disturbed " him , but none of it , he thought , would harm the @entity4 if it became public			0
@entity1 said that he thought the documents were old and that the situations they referred to had changed or ended			1
" i believed that if the general public , especially the @entity4 public , had access to the information ... it could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to @entity26 and @entity27 , " he said , according to a statement that @entity1 's lawyer , @entity88 , posted a link to on his site			1
@entity101 's full statement @entity1 's statement also explains why he enlisted : " my natural interest in geopolitical affairs			1
" @entity2 has said that he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing			1
" even if you 're not doing anything wrong you 're being watched and recorded , " he said			0
explaining his motivation to @entity36 journalist @entity111 in an edited video published on the newspaper 's website in june , @entity2 said the @entity47 's activities were tantamount to " abuses			1
" he also revealed to @entity36 that he had access to everyone working at the @entity47 , the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the globe			1
" i 'm just another guy who sits there day to day in the office , watching what 's happening , and goes , ' this is something that 's not our place to decide			0
' the public needs to decide whether these programs or policies are right or wrong , " he said			2
how much damage did they do ? @entity1 was acquitted tuesday on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy , and experts say that clearly illustrates that the government did not provide convincing evidence that he helped enemies of the @entity4 through his leaking			1
he was convicted on several other counts and now probably faces a lengthy term in a military prison			2
at @entity1 's sentencing proceeding , the prosecution called retired @entity147			1
gen. @entity148 , who at one point had headed up the @entity150 , which assessed the possible damage that @entity1 's actions had caused			1
@entity148 testified that there were concerns about some 900 @entity27 who were identified in some way in the documents			0
but he did n't say if any of those @entity27 were harmed			0
asked if @entity1 had made the jobs of junior intelligence analysts more difficult by damaging their superiors ' trust in them , @entity148 said it was " hugely important to empower these young intel analysts			1
" but experts outside the courtroom say the mere fact that sensitive information was able to be leaked by an @entity23 private damaged the image of the @entity4 and its ability to influence global affairs			1
" @entity1 's leaking of classified cables made diplomats and officials wonder , ' well , if i talk to an @entity4 , will whatever i say wind up in the newspaper or published online ? " said @entity172 , director and senior fellow of technology and public policy program at the @entity176			2
" it suggested to the world that we could n't keep secrets and we could n't control people with access to secrets			0
" much of the information contained in @entity1 's leaks was outdated , @entity172 points out			2
some of the cables were years old			0
@entity2 case is different @entity2 's case is different , officials say , because he disclosed how the government actually collects telephone and online information , leaving the @entity47 to try to reassemble its surveillance networks			1
@entity199 and security officials have said that the surveillance programs were necessary to combat terrorist threats			2
in an interview with @entity0 , secretary of state @entity203 called @entity2 " an individual who threatened this country and put @entity4 at risk			2
" " people may die as a consequence of what this man did , " @entity203 said			0
" it is possible the @entity4 will be attacked because terrorists may now know how to protect themselves in some way or another , that they did n't know before			0
" in congressional testimony , @entity47 deputy director @entity216 said that @entity2 's acts " constituted an irresponsible and real damage to the capabilities " of the @entity47			1
former @entity45 chief @entity221 had some of the harshest language for @entity2			2
in a @entity0 op - ed , @entity221 said that @entity2 far eclipsed the damage that @entity1 caused			1
@entity227 's editorial " first , there is the undeniable operational effect of informing adversaries of @entity4 intelligence 's tactics , techniques and procedures			0
@entity2 's disclosures go beyond the " what " of a particular secret or source			2
he is busily revealing the " how " of @entity4 collection , " @entity221 wrote			0
... " there are already reports of counter-terrorism targets changing their communications patterns			0
and i would lose all respect for @entity57 's @entity245 and @entity58 's @entity246 if they have not already fully harvested @entity2 's digital data trove			2
" military law attorney @entity249 told @entity0 that there is some good that can come of @entity2 's leaking , though the former president of the @entity254 is quick to add that he has little sympathy for @entity2			2
his leaks helped lead to congressional hearings and a re-examination of how much intelligence gathering is appropriate and when it may be venturing into abusive territory			0
" the public knowing , at least being aware , of the powers of the @entity265 court showed new and sweeping powers being exercised by the executive branch , " @entity249 said			0
" this is a democratic country , a democratic society			0
an informed electorate is essential			0
not every voter should know everything , " he said			0
" but there is increasing concern across the political spectrum " that those powers may be overreaching .			0

@entity31 leaker @entity1 was convicted of violations of the @entity41
@entity2 disclosed sensitive programs run by the @entity47
while they both leaked , their *circumstances* -- and *future* -- could be far different
