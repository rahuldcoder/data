only a few people would feel at ease to send @entity3 cartoon clippings			2
@entity4 was one of them			2
throughout much of @entity8 's eight years in the @entity9 , @entity10 -- a political science professor and longtime @entity8 friend -- exchanged political and humor cartoons with the first lady			1
nothing , it seemed , was too small or inconsequential to send back and forth			0
in may 1996 , @entity3 clipped a " @entity16 " cartoon and sent it to @entity10 and her husband , @entity17 , with a note that read , " it is rare that i can send you a comic strip you and @entity17 have n't seen -- but this one is too good not to share			1
" it showed a cow lying on a psychologist 's chair with a thought bubble reading , " i 'm not a mad cow			0
... i just have issues ... " -- a reference to the mad cow scare at the time and the criticism of @entity3 's role in her husband 's failed health care reform effort in his first term			1
@entity40 : @entity3 wo n't be judged by her husband 's legacy in the reliably loyal and closely protective @entity8 inner circle , @entity10 was a power center for most of the former first lady 's life			1
she counseled @entity8 -- her friend since 1972 -- during the failed push for health care reform and was there for her through her husband 's affair with @entity9 intern @entity53			1
she had the first lady 's ear on everything from @entity58 nominees to relations with @entity60			0
during all of these exchanges , @entity10 took copious notes and kept a sporadic diary of her interactions with the @entity65			2
those documents , which were donated to the @entity67 after @entity10 's death in 2000 , give an unguarded and detailed view into @entity8 's life			1
( @entity71 reached out to @entity8 's office for comment about the documents , but a spokesman did not respond			1
) inside politics : @entity78 's advice for @entity3 the comfort of old friends the documents also show @entity10 's relationship with @entity8 was one of trust , love and the comfort of old friends			1
@entity10 was born in @entity87 in 1938 and raised in the @entity88 until she went to @entity90 for a political science degree			2
she came back to @entity87 after graduation and worked as a legislative secretary and speechwriter for sen. @entity96 of @entity97			0
aside from a love of politics , both @entity8 and @entity10 were @entity101 transplants , moving to the state because of the men they married			1
@entity8 on critics : ' do n't get dragged down ' in 1963 , @entity10 married @entity106 , a member of the @entity107 , and the couple settled in @entity109 , where @entity10 taught political science at the @entity67			1
@entity111 , a close friend of both women , called @entity10 a " very welcoming person			2
" @entity111 , who is mentioned throughout @entity10 's documents , is now dean of the @entity67 @entity115 in @entity116			2
" when you were around her , you knew the conversation was going to be exhilarating , " he said			0
in " living history , " @entity8 's 2003 memoir , the former first lady described @entity10 as the " closest friend " she had during those early years in northwest @entity101			1
" we played tennis and traded favorite books , " @entity8 wrote			2
" @entity4 regularly met for lunch in the @entity128 " to " share stories and gossip			0
" the fact that @entity10 and @entity8 had arrived in @entity109 by fate led her to call it " fate - ville " in notes to @entity8			1
the @entity136 and @entity137 shared many of their most important moments together			0
after @entity4 and her first husband divorced , she married @entity10 , a lawyer at @entity141 , in 1979			2
then - gov. @entity8 performed their marriage and @entity3 was the " best person , " as @entity8 described in her book			2
@entity17 and @entity4 stayed at the @entity9 on the @entity136 ' first night there in 1993			0
and when the @entity146 renominated @entity8 in 1996 , @entity10 was in the skybox with @entity3 's family and closest friends			1
an unguarded look into the @entity136 @entity10 's documents give an unguarded look into the lives of @entity3 and @entity8 , from @entity8 's days as @entity101 governor and rising @entity146 star to the couple 's time in the @entity9 , warts and all			1
@entity10 wrote in her diary that @entity3 called @entity53 , the @entity9 intern who nearly brought down her husband 's presidency , a " narcissistic loony toon			1
" @entity3 defended her husband 's adultery by saying it was caused , partly , because " the ugly forces started making up hateful things about them , pounding on them			2
" @entity10 also noted a 1994 conversation in which the first lady asked her for advice on " how best to preserve her general memories of the administration and of health care in particular			0
" when asked why she wanted to keep the documents , @entity8 replied , " revenge			0
" @entity180 's diary : @entity3 wanted to preserve records for ' revenge ' during all of these times , @entity10 used her background as a historian and a researcher to document her interactions with @entity8			1
she kept fastidious notes , and her journal entries were incredibly detailed			0
her boxes of documents are chock - full of @entity9 letterhead , invites to @entity87 parties and internal campaign memos			0
@entity10 worked on both of @entity8 's presidential campaigns , and throughout much of it , the historian would document the ups and downs in polls , the stories that critiqued him and the positive moments the campaign experienced			1
after the 1992 race , @entity10 received permission to interview most of the campaign staff for a possible book , and now historians at the @entity67 are cataloging the interviews for an oral history collection			0
an inside view of a presidential campaign " what you really do get is this inside view of a political campaign , " said @entity212 , the political science professor overseeing the oral history project			0
" it is one of those really interesting situations where you have somebody that is an academic who is obviously thinking about the historical record about what is happening and at the same time is @entity3 's best friend			1
" @entity10 papers offer insight into @entity3 in a sign of the times , @entity10 clipped magazine and newspaper stories about the @entity136			1
in the 16 boxes of documents housed at the @entity67 , dozens of folders were filled with newspaper clippings from @entity8 's time as governor and president			1
a @entity242 cover story was folded among those from @entity101 newspapers			0
these clippings also regularly made their way to the @entity9 , where @entity10 's letters were expedited to go right to the @entity136 and not to the @entity9 correspondence office			2
after news of what @entity10 's notes revealed emerged last week , some columnists questioned her motivation for allowing the notes to be released			2
" one might at least wonder whether @entity10 told @entity3 she was taking notes that she would release posthumously , " the @entity257 's @entity256 wrote			1
" that 's certainly one form of life insurance			0
but would n't it have been more close - friendish to wait until all parties concerned were enjoying the hereafter before publishing notes that could damage the living ? " friends in @entity101 close to both @entity8 and @entity10 reject that notion , with one saying there was nothing " sinister or machiavellian about the notes that everyone are interested in			1
" " i do n't buy it			0
knowing them both , i do n't buy it , " said @entity111 , the dean at the @entity115			0
" i think her motive was history and political science			0
" he added , " these are just two ordinary human beings , both brilliant , both smart , but who are above all personal buddies			0
" @entity3 was a supporter of making the @entity10 records public in 2010			1
@entity10 's " contributions will grow and live on , enlarging our understanding of history , politics and culture , " @entity8 said then			1
" i hope also that some young scholar will come along and write the story of @entity4 , " she said			0
" we miss her still but this , along with so many of her contributions to us , lives on			0
" in may 2000 , @entity10 was diagnosed with lung cancer			2
that year , the @entity67 awarded her an honorary doctor of laws degree , and she spoke at the commencement			0
@entity10 died a little more than a month after learning of her illness			1
she left behind her husband and two children			0
" the tragic part in all this is that she got sick and she died , and the process was left unfulfilled , " @entity111 said			0
" it is tragedy for history , for @entity101 , and it is a personal tragedy for her friends			0

longtime friend kept fastidious records of all things @entity8
@entity4 's papers give insight into @entity8 's campaigns , @entity3 's thinking
@entity3 considered @entity10 , who died in 2000 , one of her closest friends
