-- hurricane season will soon be upon the @entity2 -- a time of year when storms and strong winds lash many of the islands so popular as vacation destinations for travelers across the world			0
currently , however , a different tempest is raging between two neighboring countries over something far more trivial , but no less volatile -- soccer			0
@entity15 and @entity16 are the latest nations to become embroiled in an unseemly spat that was born on the football field but quickly escalated to dominate and strain diplomatic channels			1
not in doubt is the fact that @entity15 's under - 17 team had their dream of reaching the soccer @entity25 crushed after being forced to withdraw from a qualifying tournament hosted by @entity16			1
pretty much everything else is up for debate			0
@entity16 claims that two @entity15 players , and their coach , tested positive for malaria and the rest of the team were quarantined to safeguard the public from the disease			1
@entity15 says the three individuals in question were not properly cared for and that the rest of the delegation were detained , forced to take anti-malarial drugs and treated like " criminals " up until their departure			1
upon returning home @entity15 officials promptly recalled their charge d'affaires to @entity16 , while a protest saw thousands march through the capital @entity49 to protest against the treatment meted out to the youth team			1
@entity16 insists the matter is now closed after an assurance from @entity15 president @entity54 , but those closely involved in the saga are in no mood to forgive or forget			1
it is not the first time the beautiful game has been the catalyst for a diplomatic flashpoint			0
the most notorious row ended in a four - day war between @entity64 and @entity65			2
the bordering nations had been at odds over issues of migration and land reform in 1969 when they were drawn to play each other in qualifying for the 1970 @entity25			0
the two legs prompted violent clashes between fans , the cutting of diplomatic ties and skirmishes on the border before @entity72 launched bombing raids shortly after			0
four days later a cease - fire deal was clinched			0
and more recently , @entity25 qualifying also sparked conflict between @entity85 neighbors @entity86 and @entity87 in 2009 as the @entity87 team bus was stoned in @entity89			0
@entity87 then refused to allow an @entity86 plane to land , prompting a recall of ambassadors			0
scuffles dominated the matches between the pair as @entity87 claimed a place at the @entity97 at the expense of their great rivals			0
back in the @entity2 , the disagreement over what happened to the team continues to cause diplomatic tension			0
@entity16 medical officials forced the squad to stay in hospital , after three of the party displayed symptoms of malaria -- but the approach was heavy - handed according to the head of @entity15 soccer			1
" the medical team were repressive , aggressive and hostile , " dr @entity115 , president of the @entity116 who accompanied the players on their trip to the tournament , wrote in his official report seen by @entity0			1
" they were not allowed to eat or shower despite being declared sick with borderline temperatures			0
" the rest of the group , despite refusing , were made to take anti-malaria drugs and then quarantined in their hotel by armed security guards until their failure to field a team against @entity64 confirmed elimination from the tournament			2
the @entity15 @entity134 described the move as " machiavellian " in the report mentioned above			2
as soon as the @entity15 contingent landed back on home soil , the crisis escalated and both governments became involved			2
cue a flurry of communications from , among others , @entity16 's prime minister @entity141 , claiming the country 's dealings with the @entity15 delegation were entirely legitimate and in line with its health protocols			1
@entity141 told the @entity150 he regretted how the issue had been " sensationalized " and that language problems between the two parties may have exacerbated the situation			0
but @entity115 persisted to note in his official report that his players had received " psychological aggression " and " medical persecution " at the hands of their @entity16 hosts			1
he told @entity0 that as far as he is concerned " the matter is not closed ... because it 's a discrimination act against our @entity15 people			1
@entity16 has to apologize to our young players before relations are restored			1
" @entity166 , president of the @entity15 - @entity167 in @entity168 , told @entity0 that @entity15 on every continent would be " outraged at this last indignity meted out to their children			2
" she claims the entire country is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after the devastating earthquake that tore the country apart in january 2010			0
she added : " even though the @entity15 authorities might have accepted to officially close the book on the football issue , due to incapacity , @entity15 civil society , both in @entity15 and in its diaspora , continues to feel appalled and indignant about the incident			2
" these children have been traumatized for life , on the way to achieving their dreams , and they were unfairly and illegally prevented from competing , which they had rightfully earned the right to do			0
" can you imagine what it must have been like for these 15 and 16 - year - olds , who were so excited to be living what was probably the greatest adventure of their young lives , to be ... treated like criminals , and thrown out of the host country , just because two team players fell ill ? " until @entity16 know the truth of what transpired , they will continue to feel that @entity15 have no right to feel hurt , angry , and outraged			1
as long as @entity16 do not understand the source of their indignation , @entity15 will continue to be incensed and resentful			1
" there can be no reconciliation until there is full acknowledgement of the truth , apologies , and forgiveness			0
" @entity16 contests such allegations			2
after meeting with a delegation sent by @entity15 's government to examine the dispute , @entity16 's deputy prime minister dr. @entity213 said : " it should be obvious that @entity16 never intended for the @entity15 to feel that they were subjected to discrimination			1
our objective is to resolve and bridge the gap			0
" @entity223 , minister of youth , sports and culture , said in a statement that the other nations in the tournament were subject to the same medical testing @entity15 received and that their quarantine was not restrictive			2
she said that @entity16 did not " expel " @entity15 from the tournament , explaining that they had decided to withdraw in consultation with the footballing authorities			1
@entity15 will have noted as they wait to see if they will be granted special dispensation to play in the under - 17 @entity25 by @entity237 , that @entity238 also congratulated the @entity16 team on their qualification			1
it appears as if this latest disagreement to be sparked by soccer may take a while to blow over .			0
