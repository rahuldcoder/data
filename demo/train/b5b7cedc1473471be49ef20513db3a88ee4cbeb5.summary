@entity0 , @entity1 -- when president @entity4 visited @entity1 on thursday , he did n't come within 300 miles of the nurse protesting her state - mandated @entity7 quarantine			1
but he has inserted himself in the middle of a growing debate between the federal government and states over their rules for health workers returning from the ebola zone			0
@entity15 , the @entity17 worker hailed by the @entity18 as a hero for treating @entity7 patients in @entity21 , on thursday defied the demands the @entity1 's @entity24 governor to remain inside her home near the @entity27 border			1
she was spotted leaving her house by bike , trailed by a state trooper			0
@entity4 , who traveled to @entity0 on thursday for a campaign rally , has sought to tamp down on fears of recently - returned health workers , inviting a group of them to the @entity18 wednesday and hailing their mission as essential			1
" when they come home , they deserve to be treated properly , " he said in the @entity38 on wednesday , flanked by doctors still within the 21 - day incubation period			0
" they deserve to be treated like the heroes that they are			0
" rules implemented this week by the @entity49 require closer monitoring of health workers returning from @entity52 , but stop short of requiring any type of quarantine			2
many states have gone further , insisting nurses and doctors remain isolated for three weeks			2
the @entity18 has questioned those state laws , saying the rules are too strict and not guided by the science of @entity7			2
the virus is spread through bodily fluids and patients are n't considered contagious until they 're showing symptoms of the disease			0
" when i hear people talking about @entity69 leadership and then are promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers , it makes me a little frustrated , " @entity4 said on wednesday			0
@entity15 was initially quarantined inside a tent in @entity76 before being allowed to leave for her home in @entity1 , where gov. @entity78 said he 'd require her to remain inside her home for 21 days			1
@entity15 said the state rules amount to a restriction on her civil rights and has threatened a legal battle over the mandated isolation			2
@entity78 , an @entity24 whose past off - color remarks have garnered national headlines , sent state troopers to @entity15 's @entity92 home to enforce the quarantine			1
on thursday , @entity18 press secretary @entity94 said only that @entity4 believed state policies " should be guided by science , " but would n't go to say whether @entity4 believed @entity1 's rules lived up to that tenet			1
a five - hour drive south from the unfolding legal machinations , @entity99 welcomed @entity4 for a political rally supporting @entity78 's opponent @entity103 , who scored a boost to his chances on wednesday when the state 's independent sen. @entity106 lent his backing			1
@entity103 , a six - term congressman , is locked in a dead heat with @entity78			0
like past races in @entity1 , an independent is also in the mix , though @entity113 is running well behind the two main party candidates			0
@entity1 's gubernatorial contest is one of only a handful of stops @entity4 will make on the campaign trail this year ; his record low approval ratings and controversial policies have made him unwelcome in key @entity123 battles			1
thursday @entity4 hit @entity24 as full of bad ideas , and resistant to measures he said could help improve the lives of middle class @entity69 , like boosting the minimum wage and insisting on equal pay for women			1
the objective in @entity1 , according to @entity133 political science professor @entity131 , is to get @entity99 to just " act like @entity99 " -- that is , vote for @entity103 over the trailing independent			1
" there is a sense that voters just need a final push to come back into the fold , " @entity131 said			0
" they are helped by the fact that the current @entity24 governor is not popular , and has very conservative views that are out of step with the majority of @entity146			0
" one area @entity78 and and his rival have found agreement , however , is quarantining @entity15			0
" it 's the state 's responsibility to make sure that people are protected here in the state of @entity1 for public safety and i support the 21 day quarantine , " the @entity150 told reporters wednesday .			2
