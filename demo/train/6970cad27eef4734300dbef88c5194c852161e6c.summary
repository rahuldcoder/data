-- after being detained for allegedly erupting outside a @entity2 , @entity3 , supermarket -- gunning down 19 people , including six fatally -- @entity5 refused to talk to investigators			1
but , well before , the 22 - year - old had proven quick and ready to share his opinions and experiences with strangers online			0
a picture on his @entity13 bulletin board posted just six hours before the shooting was by no means @entity5 's only foray into social media			2
in fact , on several websites over the past three years , @entity5 presented over-the - top assertions , posed random questions and made rambling comments that drew sympathy , scorn and confusion from others in his online forums			2
he griped about losing job after job			0
ranted about handicapped people and the educational system			2
and opened up about his round - the - clock struggle with aggression and difficulty in finding companionship			0
" he seems like one of those people who avoids substance abuse because he is already strange , " one commenter posted about an online persona , later identified as @entity5 , on a thread on the gaming website @entity39			1
postings on @entity39 , which bills itself as a " free browser - based strategy game " in which members take over a nation 's economy and military , were similar to those of a person believed to be @entity5 made on the site , @entity53 , as well as on @entity13			1
together , these online comments and diatribes suggest a person eagerly trying to engage others , unafraid to articulate his personal struggles and , while only rarely hinting at violence , displaying little in the way of political correctness or respect for powers - that - be			0
even as he had frightened fellow students and alarmed instructors at @entity66 , a poster identified friday on the @entity39 site as " @entity69 " and referred to , in responses and by himself , as @entity5 often interacted with fellow users			1
an @entity39 blog posted friday said that @entity5 had made more than 100 posts on 50 topics , having participated in games on the site since his high school days			1
he 'd started nearly 30 of these threads himself , but had not been active since june 2010 , according to the post			0
" as a community , we are absolutely horrified that someone who had been part of our relatively small group could be involved in such a horrible act , " the post said			1
beyond the gaming elements , @entity39 also features private threads in which its members can comment on a variety of topics			1
that includes rants on hot - button topics and even cartoons , including one in which the poster , @entity69 , refers to himself as @entity5			1
some postings are lighter in nature , on subjects ranging from weightlifting to taxidermy to @entity69 's affinity for the music group @entity105			1
on a thread he started that solicits stories about rejection by the opposite sex , he expresses sadness			0
and on a thread about the participants ' hardest final exam , @entity69 ends one comment with the words " mental breakdown			1
" he titled one message string " would you hit a @entity125 ? , " posting insulting words about and images of mentally challenged people			0
on a may 9 thread , @entity69 asks : " dose ( sic ) anyone have aggression 24/7 ? " while they engage and kid with him on occasion , fellow commenters on @entity39 increasingly call out @entity69 for what they call his nonsensical rants			1
@entity69 's posts also dwell extensively on his employment history			2
on a thread started by @entity69 on may 14 , 2010 , the poster expresses his disgust after filling out more than 20 applications for a part - time job and being rejected			1
according to the post , @entity69 was terminated from " @entity142 , @entity144 fast food , @entity145 - @ [ @entity146 who knew @entity5 outside of the game ] ... the drug hang out. , @entity149 , and @entity150			1
" @entity151 , owner of the @entity145 in the @entity152 , told @entity0 in a phone interview that @entity5 was employed at his restaurant as a busboy from november 2006 until february 2008 , when he put in his two - week notice and told @entity151 that he planned to join the @entity157			2
" he was a good , quiet kid , " @entity151 said			0
" we have no negative items in his file			0
" a person at the @entity2 office of @entity142 confirmed that @entity5 was employed from january to march 2006 at the pizza parlor on @entity164 , down the street from where the shooting occurred in @entity2			2
no one there recalled @entity5 , but payroll records verified he worked as a general crew member			2
@entity171 , who said he worked with @entity5 at @entity149 , told @entity0 's @entity172 on tuesday that @entity5 was fired because of poor customer service and that he " did n't really care about work or anything			1
" @entity176 , a spokesperson for @entity150 , said by e-mail that " @entity5 was not employed at @entity150 at the time of saturday 's incident and has not worked for the company for more than a year			2
" dare is approximately the inverse of the name @entity183 , which was used on another website , abovetopsecret.com			0
@entity186 , that site 's co-owner , said he believes @entity183 is @entity5			1
between february 2009 and september 2010 , @entity183 made assertions such as that @entity189 had never flown a manned space shuttle mission , there was no @entity193 rover , and people can make their own currency			0
@entity53 focuses on " alternative news " and information " not covered by the mainstream media , " @entity186 said			0
he noted that all the postings attributed to @entity183 originated in @entity5 's hometown of @entity2			2
those messages from @entity183 -- riddled with grammatical errors -- often became the object of ridicule , scorn or sympathy from other contributors			0
" the ranting about proof , ( your ) inability to make a coherent sentence gives you away red handed , " one person wrote			0
" it wo n't be long ( until ) you have been banned once again			0
" unlike some of his posts as @entity69 on the @entity39 site , the comments from @entity183 on did n't mention violence			1
but they do reflect a strong urge to break free of any restraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials			0
@entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
