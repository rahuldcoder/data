-- for the serious contenders at grand slams , it 's all about trying to advance with minimal fuss in the first week			0
that way they have plenty of energy left for when the competition picks up in the second week			0
@entity10 certainly is n't messing around in the early stages of this year 's @entity12			1
after crushing @entity13 -- a potentially tricky opponent -- in the first round in 55 minutes , @entity10 routed another fellow @entity15 , @entity16 , 6 - 1 6 - 0 in 56 minutes thursday to reach the third round			1
men 's no. 1 @entity18 made quick work of his opponent , too , dispatching @entity22 6 - 1 6 - 3 6 - 0			2
this grand slam is big for @entity10			1
even though she has won 17 majors , none have come in 2014 and she did n't progress to the quarterfinals at the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
but @entity31 could once again bring @entity10 joy -- she is the two - time defending champion			1
the top seed 's only problems against @entity16 came in her first service game , when @entity10 hit three double faults in windy conditions			1
@entity10 ' path to the final got a little easier when @entity40 was upset by big - serving @entity42 @entity41 7 - 5 6 - 4 and @entity43 -- who defeated @entity10 in the 2011 final -- blew match points and lost to @entity47 's @entity46 in a third - set tiebreak			1
@entity40 and @entity43 were in @entity10 ' quarter			1
just how potent is @entity41 's serve ? she trailed only @entity10 in aces heading into the tournament			1
still , it marks more grand slam disappointment for @entity40 , the eighth seed and a former no. 1			2
despite occupying the final spot in the race for the year - end championships , @entity40 crashed out early at @entity29 , @entity30 and now the @entity12			1
" i do put a lot of expectations on myself , " @entity40 told reporters			2
" i tried to overanalyze and overthink instead of just playing the game			2
" it 's a work in process			0
but i think i have potential to do well " at grand slams " and that 's something i want to change for next year			0
" almost forgotten this year is @entity67 , since she 's missed most of 2014 with a foot injury and this month dealt with a knee complaint			0
the two - time finalist , however , rallied from a break down in the first set and then cruised past @entity73 6 - 3 6 - 2			0
" it 's always going to take time to rebuild , " @entity67 told reporters			0
" i feel like i 'm improving day to day			0
" i play much better than i played a month ago			0

@entity10 crushes @entity16 at the @entity12 on thursday
@entity10 loses just one game in the 56 - minute second - round rout in @entity31
the @entity12 is @entity10 ' last *opportunity* to win a major this year
her chances improved after @entity40 was upset in *straight* sets
