-- dear @entity1 , first of all i have to say : congratulations ! we have all come a long way from once being mistakenly called the inferior sex			2
i remember the first time i read @entity10 's view that a female is an incomplete male , " or as it were , a deformity			2
" i was really offended and furious			2
the first thing that popped in my mind was , " we have to prove all our detractors wrong			2
" but we definitely ca n't do that with 60 million of our girls out of school ! so yes , we have come a long way , but we are still not there yet			1
a wise friend recently told me : no child in the developing world has died directly due to the lack of education			1
they die due to illness , during childbirth , due to violence , poverty , etc. -- which is probably why the world has n't yet understood the gravity of having more than 100 million children not in primary school , of which 60 million are girls			1
if you really think hard , you will realize that the way to end the cycle of poverty , reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and early marriage and many other ills that befall our girls is through education			1
an educated girl will marry later , will have fewer and healthier children , will educate her daughters and without a doubt her sons , will be self - sufficient and , most importantly , will have a voice			1
she will not only dream but also realize her dreams of becoming whoever she wants to be			0
i am writing this letter to all of you girls , but especially appealing to those who have had the privilege of going to school			1
we need to use our educated voices to raise awareness in our families , communities , countries and the world and say we can not and will not ignore our sisters anymore			1
they have the same rights as we do , and there can be no discrimination			0
we can and must hold our governments accountable and ask them to give us the answers and results we deserve			0
i am also writing this letter to all the boys -- fathers , brothers and husbands , friends who have supported us			1
i am grateful that you see us as just as important to the human race as our male counterparts			0
your support and belief in us keeps us encouraged to keep powering on			0
please keep it coming and please spread the word			0
finally , i write to those we want to affect with our voices positively : you have the right to an education			0
you have the right to grow up healthy , in safety , and with equal access to opportunity			0
i , and millions of your supporters across the globe , stand with you in the pursuit of equality			0
@entity102 is coming ; the world is listening			2
i know that this movement -- your movement -- will grow in influence and scope			0
my promise to you : i will continue to use my voice as your voice			1
together , we can ensure that girls everywhere can go to school and stay in school			2
you hold our future in your hands			0
