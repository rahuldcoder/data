-- in front of a packed house at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity1 expressed the spirit of the day : " good morning , children of the ' 80s , " she said to the crowd gathered for the marathon charity concert live aid			1
" this is your @entity15 , and it 's long overdue			2
" skeptics might disagree with @entity1 -- and many did at the time -- but the heart of the july 13 , 1985 , show was in the right place , says former @entity26 vj @entity24			1
" i wind up feeling like i speak in clich√©s when i talk about this day -- and i lived through the ' 60s -- but it was a day when we felt like we were making a difference , " said @entity24 , now 58 , who was there with the rest of his @entity26 colleagues			1
" and i believe that we did			2
" live aid grew out of concern for the victims of famine in @entity39			2
the crisis sparked " do they know it 's @entity42 , " a @entity43 single sung by an all - star cast put together by the @entity47 ' @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity48 , and then " @entity50 , " an @entity52 single spearheaded by @entity53 and manager @entity54			0
with both songs having hit no. 1 in their respective countries , a movement began for a live show to raise money for the cause			1
the concert , which took place 25 years ago tuesday , ran live in both the @entity43 and the @entity52 : at @entity65 's @entity64 and the now - defunct @entity4			1
the lineup included @entity67 , @entity68 , a young @entity69 , @entity70 , the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and -- on both sides of the @entity75 , thanks to a timely @entity77 flight -- @entity78			1
though live aid was far from the first charity show , its success gave birth to other fund - raisers , including @entity85 and live 8			1
it also led to a knighthood for @entity46 , today better known for his charity work than his music			0
@entity24 , now a @entity92 personality and a dj for @entity94 , talked to @entity0 about his memories of the show , its outstanding performances , the crazy rumors and his old employer			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity0 : what was it like to actually be there ? @entity24 : the way the weather has been in the @entity109 , that 's how it was that day			1
we got onto the site at 6 in the morning , and it was hot and humid			0
and that really informed everything that happened , because everybody was running around working really hard			0
it was just incredibly hot , and they were hosing people in the front rows			0
@entity0 : there had been fund - raising shows before -- the @entity121 , the one for @entity122 -- but the level of this was completely different			1
@entity24 : sure , it was n't the first time it had happened			1
but it was gargantuan compared to any of those			0
the scope of it really was incomprehensible for [ the @entity132 ]			0
we saw the crowd there at @entity4 , 100,000 people or so , and we knew we were carried in all these places that were sending us feeds , but the real concept of it -- of how many were actually watching -- you really could n't get your head around it that day			2
it was n't until years later that i started to understand how many did actually see it			2
@entity0 : what were some of the rumors ? i remember hearing that the @entity150 were going to reform , that @entity152 was going to play and @entity153 and @entity154 would come out , say with @entity68 's son @entity155			0
@entity24 : i do n't recall that particular rumor , but what i do remember -- and this kind of stuff was floating up to us -- was that we were all kind of surprised that @entity162 [ @entity163 ] was n't there			1
and so there were some rumors somehow that got started somewhere that , " it was @entity162 's lighting rig up there , @entity162 's lighting rig			0
" how can you tell one lighting rig from another ? @entity0 : what were some of your favorite performances ? @entity24 : the big one of the day was the @entity177 reunion			1
i was so shocked in days hence , when i 'd speak to friends or family who watched it on tv , [ they ] thought they sounded awful , and apparently the band thought they sounded awful			0
i thought they sounded amazing on stage , which is where we were watching			0
... @entity72 was really amazing that day , i thought , and it was right around the time [ her ] nude pictures came out , and she made some sort of comment that " i ai n't taking s * * * off today			1
" and even at the end , we were all up there singing " @entity50 , " and there were people there who i think did n't wind up getting to perform who were part of that finale			0
@entity0 : do you think shows like this make a difference ? there 's always the question about , does this money get to the proper place ? [ the @entity209 reported in march that millions of dollars went to rebels to buy weapons ; @entity46 disputed much of the @entity209 's report			1
] @entity24 : i do n't know the inner workings -- i know , like you , what i read in the newsmagazines -- [ but ] i have to believe that some of the money gets there			1
@entity46 , i know , gets irate -- and he 's no dummy -- he gets irate at the thought that people think that he 's stiffing people and that the majority of the money is n't getting to the people who should be getting it			2
[ but ] we raised a lot of money and we also raised a lot of awareness , and i think both are equally valuable			0
i think the awareness continues today , and so does the money , from what i understand			0
at the end of the day ... it was everything the ' 60s wanted itself to be , and maybe was n't , really			0
and here , in the greed - is - good ' 80s , look at what happened			0
@entity0 : what do you think of @entity26 nowadays ? @entity24 : i do n't			1
( laughs ) my daughter does watch it			0
but i think the most telling thing was just a few months ago , they took the [ word ] " music " out of the logo			2
and they were only 10 years late doing that , i think .			2
