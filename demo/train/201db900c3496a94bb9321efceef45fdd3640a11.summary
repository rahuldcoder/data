-- @entity2 's elections this weekend could trigger the country 's exit from the euro -- but even that might not save @entity7 from splintering , the head of insurance giant @entity9 has warned			1
@entity10 told @entity0 " a @entity2 exit wo n't solve everything , " adding the problems in @entity7 are " more complex than that			1
" @entity15 , a fan of @entity2 mythology , believes a @entity2 exit would be akin to opening a @entity18			1
" opening the box is very tempting before and very disastrous afterwards , " he said			0
@entity15 said there were " flaws " in the construction of the euro which have created the cracks			2
" it was a case of putting the cart before the horse , " he said			0
" economic policies were not converging enough and the disciplines were not strong enough to allow for a stable position in the long run			0
" the worst - case scenario , according to @entity32 , would be a disorderly default by @entity2 leading to its collapse out of the euro			1
further , @entity37 and @entity38 could suffer bank runs that could exacerbate the bloc 's pain			1
however , such an outcome could be avoided should a moderate party win a majority in the @entity2 elections , securing the country 's future in the eurozone , he said			2
@entity15 points to the @entity38 banking crisis as one which must be resolved so @entity7 can allay concerns about the strength of its firewalls			2
" we need to be sure that we do n't just have the fire brigade , " he said , " but that water is coming out of the pipe			0
the @entity38 case is a good test for that			2
" @entity9 , the second - biggest insurer in @entity7 , has been offloading its investments in @entity2 debt -- at a 78 % write - down -- and no longer buys @entity37 and @entity38 debt , as it seeks to distance itself from the deepening crisis			1
@entity15 said the company 's investment portfolio is being kept diverse : " we have approximately 80 % of our assets in bonds , of which half or a little less are in sovereign bonds			0
the other half is in corporate bonds and 20 % are in other asset classes such as equities and real estate , " he added			0
