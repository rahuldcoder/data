-- a parade of world leaders took the lectern at the @entity4 on wednesday			1
but days before the speeches on a host of issues , the global body quietly undertook an issue that often flies under the radar : women			2
the @entity4 consolidated four agencies that tackle women 's issues and created a new super agency			1
last week , the @entity4 consolidated four agencies that tackle women 's issues and created a new super agency			1
humanitarian workers around the world embraced the move			0
it was about time , they said , that the world got serious about how half its population lives			2
the 1945 charter on which the @entity4 was founded mandates equal rights for men and women			2
since then , the @entity4 has added new agencies that focus specifically on children , the environment , refugees , health , education , atomic energy and @entity37			2
all report directly to the secretary general , except the agencies pertaining to women			2
women 's advocates said the agencies were run by lower - ranking officials and lacked clout			1
in 2006 , a high - level panel on @entity4 reform described the women 's agencies as " incoherent , under - resourced and fragmented			1
" it recommended that the @entity4 create a dynamic agency focused on gender equality and women 's empowerment			1
and last year , a coalition of 300 private development agencies launched the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , which pressured the @entity4 to create a single organization to address what it described as consistent neglect of women 's needs			1
@entity65 , co-director of @entity66 , said a double standard persists , despite the image of the @entity4 as a strong women 's advocacy machine			1
the only thing the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) has in common with the well - known @entity74 ( @entity74 ) is a similar sounding name , @entity71 said			0
@entity73 had neither the high - level @entity4 staff nor the money of @entity74 , said @entity71 , who worked at @entity74 for 15 years			2
she said @entity73 's entire global budget equaled the budget of the @entity74 operation in @entity82			0
@entity71 hopes the new agency will " lift the ideals that are worded so eloquently in @entity4 declarations and resolutions off of the inert pages they 're written on and plant them in real women 's lives			1
" " women who have been leading and achieving for decades without the help of the @entity4 system will now enjoy the strengths and benefits that the @entity4 can offer , " she said			2
development agencies shared high expectations for the new agency 's promotion of women 's rights in a world where a disproportionate number of the suffering and persecuted are female			1
" this is a great move , " said @entity105 , president of @entity106 , an international humanitarian agency that focuses on empowering women and girls in developing nations			2
" now , what 's needed are resources , a clear mandate and strong leadership , " she said			0
" but i think what we 're looking for most is the accountability to make sure gender is integrated into all @entity4 strategies			0
it 's up to member states to move quickly , get this new agency off on the right foot and turn the plan into reality			0
" ahead of this week 's @entity4 meetings , @entity73 issued a report on the progress of women 's rights , part of a set of development goals that global agencies have committed to achieving by 2015			1
" implementation still has a long way to go in translating commitments to women 's rights into changes in women 's lives , " @entity73 said			1
roughly 60 percent of the world 's population living in poverty are women and girls			1
according to @entity73 : women are outnumbered four to one in legislatures around the world			0
over 60 percent of all unpaid family workers globally are women , and women still earn on average 17 percent less than men			1
about one - third of women still suffer gender - based violence during their lives			0
in some parts of the world , one in 10 women dies from pregnancy - related causes even though the means for preventing maternal mortality are cost - effective and well - known			0
" gender gaps on this scale are symptomatic of an accountability crisis , " @entity73 said			0
" governments and multilateral organizations have a responsibility to do a better job of answering to women			0
" last week , the @entity169 voted to merge @entity73 and three other @entity4 women 's agencies to better address glaring gender inequities			1
in @entity175 , for example , the @entity173 adopted a new sexual offense bill that hands a minimum 10 - year - sentence to a man who is convicted of rape			0
if he is acquitted , his accuser goes to jail for 10 years			0
the bill was adopted two years ago over the objections of women lawmakers			0
@entity71 cited the @entity175 law as an example of the uphill climb women face in developing nations			0
she said @entity66 and other non-governmental organizations are urging the @entity4 to fund the new women 's agency with an initial $ 1 billion budget			1
advocates would also like to see a presence of the agency in every developing nation , she said			0
hiv / aids agencies especially welcomed the news			0
" this is a historic opportunity to advance the rights of women and girls , " said @entity201 , executive director of the @entity4 agency on hiv / aids			1
he noted that 60 percent of people living with @entity203 in @entity209 are women			1
some aid agencies say that number is as high as 75 percent			0
@entity71 said the new agency has the potential to change the way the @entity4 functions in everything it does , as every institution -- whether it 's a courtroom or classroom , a political party or a pub , a gymnasium or a country club -- opens its doors to women			2
and treats them differently , once they step inside .			0

@entity4 consolidates agencies , creates group focused on women 's issues
women 's advocates say previous agencies lacked clout
roughly 60 percent of the world 's population living in poverty are women and girls
