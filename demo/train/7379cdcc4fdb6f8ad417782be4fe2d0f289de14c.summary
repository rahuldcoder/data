@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 is a former @entity5 's @entity4 supermodel - turned - philanthropist			1
despite her riches , @entity2 , who grew up with few luxuries in communist @entity7 , told @entity9 that her most important work is her charity , the @entity11			1
the model set up the foundation after her near - death experience in the 2004 @entity16 tsunami			1
while @entity2 survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours , her long - term partner did not			1
here , @entity2 shows @entity9 around @entity19 and tells of her love for the " @entity21 , " what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life 's setbacks			1
@entity9 : tell us about the first time you came to @entity19			1
@entity2 : the first time was to visit my aunt and even if @entity19 is in the same country as my town , it felt like a real journey			1
for us it was like going somewhere very special , far away , because under the communist regime you did n't travel that much and @entity19 was " wow			1
" i was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of @entity19 and every time i arrive in @entity19 , even now , i 'm still amazed			1
the lighting at night ; the incredible architecture ; the details ; the history ; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover			2
it was a very special experience			2
the following time i went to @entity19 was during my early career in the fashion industry and i was traveling once , twice a week from my town to @entity19			1
i would wake up at 5.45 in the morning , take the bus for one hour , then a tram to school			2
after school i would take a five - hour train to @entity19			1
so it was quite intense at that time , but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent			2
@entity9 : how would you describe @entity19 , in five words ? @entity2 : @entity19 is a city of romance , of incredible architecture and history			1
some people call it the " golden city , " some people say it 's the heart of @entity68 -- although maybe the @entity69 do n't like that very much ! @entity71 is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and @entity19 is smaller and has more of a village - y feeling compared to @entity71			1
@entity19 has more of a calming vibe			1
it 's not rush - rush - rush			2
i think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of @entity19 and also the vivid colors			1
i think they may imagine @entity19 more in gray colors because of the communist association			1
but since then a lot of reconstruction has been done			2
before @entity19 was shades of grey and black , which was quite mysterious , but now it 's more happy and pretty			1
in five words it 's historical , inspirational , creative , romantic and beautiful			2
@entity9 : what was your childhood like ? @entity2 : growing up in the @entity96 -- at the time @entity7 -- was a beautiful childhood because i did n't understand the whole concept of communism			1
i was only 11 when communism fell down and when the @entity102 happened			2
i had a really beautiful childhood ... i did n't have the great luxury things , we had very little and we counted every penny			2
but our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that 's priceless			2
we did n't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries			0
so we went around our country to see different castles , little towns and i loved it			0
so that made us richer			0
it also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature			0
and the values you learn there are priceless too			0
you do n't step on flowers , kick on mushrooms , you really respect nature			0
and the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit			0
having a clementine for @entity134 -- it was an incredible joy and every time i smell a clementine , it brings me back to my childhood			0
but it was harder for my parents			0
because if you were n't part of the system then you did n't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you			0
my parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you did n't get enough stamps throughout the year , you would get in trouble			0
@entity9 : what happened to you in the 2004 tsunami ? @entity2 : i lost my partner and physically , my pelvis was broken four times , i was drowning many times throughout the experience			1
there were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones			0
seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers , there was just a lot of love around in that moment			0
that 's what happens actually if you live through disasters , it brings people together , it shows that we are capable of that compassion , but unfortunately it just goes away after some time			2
@entity9 : tell us about your foundation , @entity180 ? @entity2 : @entity180 is a foundation that i established after the tsunami			1
it helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives			0
we build or rebuild a school , add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school			0
the education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them , their families and communities get out of poverty			0
we help over 23,000 children a year			0
we give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities			0
the schools elevate the whole community			0
after the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in @entity215			2
we work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that 's something incredible because it really changed so many lives			0
our other project is in @entity225 , where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year			0
@entity9 : if you only had 24 hours in @entity19 , what would you do ? @entity2 : first of all i would take my friends and family and i would walk around and go to the @entity235 because that is my favorite place			1
then i would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist			0
and then i would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the @entity240			0
in the evening i may go to a typical @entity96 pub and afterwards for a concert because i really love them ; they put my mind at ease and inspire me			1
@entity9 : how creative is the city ? @entity2 : many people know about @entity248 and some of the other famous writers			1
but there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. that 's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors			0
that 's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden			0
not just @entity96 authors but also a lot of @entity268 authors because especially anything from @entity268 was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music			1
i discovered @entity275 seven years ago and i 'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies			0
@entity9 : if @entity19 were a person , who would it be ? @entity2 : i think @entity19 would be our former president @entity280			1
he is a proud person and @entity19 is a proud city ; he 's an artist and @entity19 is artistic ; he 's an achiever and @entity19 has achieved so much			1
he is someone people admire , as they do @entity19 .			2

@entity96 supermodel and philanthropist shows @entity9 around her " @entity287 , " @entity19
@entity2 : " @entity19 is like former president @entity280 : admirable , *artictic* and proud "
@entity2 also talks about growing up under communism and surviving the 2004 @entity16 tsunami
