-- there is no evidence to suggest that the two men who used stolen passports to get aboard @entity6 had anything to do with its disappearance saturday as it was flying from @entity9 to @entity10 , an official said tuesday			1
" the more information we get , the more we 're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident , " @entity12 secretary general @entity11 told reporters tuesday at his organization 's headquarters in @entity16 , @entity17			1
here 's what we know about what happened , how it happened and why			2
who are they ? the passengers are @entity29 , 29 , and @entity30 , 18			2
they entered @entity31 on february 28 using valid @entity33 passports			1
@entity0 obtained an @entity35 photo of what appears to be the two men with two of their friends			2
metadata from the photo indicates that it was shot with an @entity42 at 8:20 p.m. the night before the plane departed			0
@entity0 has blurred the faces of the other two men to protect their identities			0
what happened ? to fly out of @entity31 , @entity29 and @entity30 used passports that were stolen in @entity48 , a booming market for stolen passports			1
the passports belonged to citizens of @entity53 and @entity54			0
" @entity48 remains a robust venue for the sale of high - quality , false passports ( which includes altered , stolen passports ) and other supporting documentation , " said @entity58 , who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years			1
the @entity53 , @entity64 , 37 , told reporters he reported his passport stolen in august			0
the @entity54 , @entity67 , 30 , had his stolen in july 2013			0
authorities said they do n't know how @entity29 and @entity30 came to possess the passports			2
@entity70 did it happen ? on saturday , @entity29 used the @entity53 's passport ; @entity30 used the @entity54 's			2
according to @entity48 police , an @entity33 man named @entity73 bought one - way tickets for the men , describing them as friends who wanted to return home to @entity79			1
while @entity73 made the initial booking by telephone , @entity73 or someone acting on his behalf paid cash for the tickets , police said			0
the tickets were purchased at the same time from @entity88 in @entity48 's baht currency and at identical prices , according to @entity92 's official e-ticket verification system @entity93			0
the ticket numbers are consecutive , implying they were issued together			0
both were for travel from @entity9 to @entity97 via @entity10			0
the ticket for the man who was using the @entity53 passport continued to @entity101 , @entity102			0
the ticket for the holder of the @entity54 passport ended in @entity106 , @entity107			1
@entity30 was hoping to emigrate to @entity107			1
the @entity33 's mother had been expecting him to arrive in @entity106 and contacted authorities when he did n't show up , said @entity31 inspector general of police @entity110			1
" if you read what the head of @entity31 police said recently , about ( @entity30 ) ... wanting to travel to @entity106 , @entity107 , to be with his mother , ( this ) is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue , " @entity12 's @entity11 said			1
@entity12 says the passports were recorded as stolen in its database			1
but no country had checked them against @entity12 's list			2
countries , not airlines , have access to @entity12 's data , and many governments do n't routinely check passports against the database			1
why did it happen ? @entity133 , deputy director of the @entity134 of @entity135 , has a plausible explanation			0
" after the @entity139 in @entity33 for human rights and democracy was crushed by @entity33 authorities , there were many @entity33 who fled to @entity31 , " he told @entity0 's @entity137			1
many @entity143 do n't need a visa to enter @entity31 , which makes it a common destination for those seeking to emigrate for any number of reasons			2
but they can run into problems when they try to depart @entity31 for countries that do require visas			2
" a stolen passport can be one way to do it , " @entity133 said			0
" unfortunately , this is quite common			0
" how do they get them ? " often persons like this , if they are going to make a play to go to somewhere like @entity107 or other parts of @entity79 , they would need some sort of broker to help them make the arrangements , " he said			1
" so it 's very possible you could have some sort of migrant smuggling group that 's involved with this			0
" @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
