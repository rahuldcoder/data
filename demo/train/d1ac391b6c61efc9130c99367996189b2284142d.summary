-- as the continent grappled with the @entity8 crisis			1
it is important to take @entity8 seriously , but @entity3 took too long to make a decision and the @entity12 nation had various options to control the risk , notably preventing fans from @entity16 from entering the country			1
@entity5 is still one of the world 's most important football tournaments and a sudden cancellation would have been ridiculous			1
the health of a continent is more important than any football tournament , but given the distance from @entity3 to where the disease is most prevalent , the risk posed to the @entity12 nation would have been small			1
@entity3 offered to host the tournament the following year , but to have staged competitions in successive years -- 2016 and 2017 -- would have caused a huge rumpus with @entity33 clubs			1
of course , an @entity5 should be played on @entity12 soil , but would offering it to @entity35 have been a better solution ? new host @entity37 -- the right choice ? for @entity2 to give the tournament to @entity37 , however , was a controversial decision			1
@entity43 officials cite @entity37 as an example of a resource - rich country that is plagued by kleptocracy problems			1
president @entity48 has been in power since 1979 and the vast majority of his citizens live in poverty			2
in recent years , anti-corruption groups have tried to draw attention to the ruling family 's assets in @entity57 and the @entity58			2
in 2012 , @entity37 co-hosted @entity5			1
i attended that tournament and it worked out , but remember @entity61 was the co-host as well and that made a huge difference			2
but @entity2 did n't have a lot of options			2
@entity16 is n't like @entity57 where you clap your hands and you have 10 countries willing to host a major tournament			1
as they say , @entity72 -- " this is @entity16			2
" to be honest @entity2 was lucky to find a replacement on that short notice			2
" @entity2 wishes to express its sincere thanks to the @entity37 people , its government and particularly president @entity80 , " said @entity2 president @entity75 in a statement			1
" to agree to organize a competition like this two months before the event , you must admit you really have to be a true @entity12			2
" but @entity2 could still face problems			2
@entity37 has two great stadiums , but the other two are not of international standard			1
it will be very difficult to host a tournament with similar conditions for all teams			1
the government will have to put in a lot of effort just to provide at least a normal playing surface			2
@entity37 's infrastructure could also present problems			1
there are a few decent roads between the airport and the stadium or from city to city , but that 's not the case for the rest of the country			0
will there be enough hotels and accommodation for the 16 teams , officials and international press ? participants need to be prepared to improvise , but it will be a big challenge for everybody involved			0
power cuts are a normal part of life in @entity16 , so it 's not unusual that stars playing for @entity57 's top clubs will have to take a cold shower or spend time in hotels without electricity , walking around with flashlights or candles			0
many international fans wonder why @entity12 stars would accept such conditions			0
the reason is simple : all @entity130 are proud to represent their country and are honored to play at @entity5 , even if they have to play on a bumpy pitch or are living in a less - than - luxurious hotel			1
for me that 's really impressive , touching even , when you realize how much it means to these guys to carry the flag for their country			0
do n't expect @entity12 players to crumble under any pressure from @entity33 clubs asking them not to travel to the tournament because of @entity8			1
the players believe that they have to fight this illness by showing some solidarity			0
uncomfortable atmosphere ? when i have been to @entity37 you often feel the locals are n't that keen to communicate with foreigners			1
the constant presence of military and police armed with rifles creates an uncomfortable atmosphere			0
when i was at the tournament in 2012 , my local driver was punched in his face with a gun because he asked politely if he could drop me and my cameraman closer to the stadium			2
that was one reason why i felt more comfortable in @entity61			0
i expect the attendances in @entity37 to be strong because the locals are big football fans			1
and if the government wants the stadiums to be full then people are most likely to go there			0
africans view @entity37 's national team somewhat critically , given it has too many naturalized players -- many were born in @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
@entity37 's participation also signals a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes , following the team 's suspension from the competition for fielding an ineligible player earlier this year			1
a crazy draw -- who are the favorites ? @entity5 offers a strange mix of football			1
within two minutes you can witness everything from amateur level to world - class ability			0
you see unbelievable skills and seconds later you shake your head about a mistake you would n't even see in the lowest leagues			0
the weaker teams are no better than @entity200 third - division level , but with teams like @entity176 you see plenty of players who earn their money at top clubs			0
however , the level , especially in the tactical area , has improved drastically over the last four tournaments			0
@entity210 is my tip to win the tournament			2
it 's a team that had a fantastic @entity215 , a convincing qualification campaign and a team where it 's hard to spot any weakness			0
@entity210 is a team that plays @entity33 football , is disciplined and physical , and has plenty of experience			0
@entity225 is a contender because of the individual class of players like @entity229 and many others			0
it 's a shame that @entity232 -- the current @entity12 champions -- did n't qualify for the tournament			1
@entity236 coach @entity235 always managed to field a team with a good mixture of overseas - based players and local youngsters			0
the @entity232 will be sorely missed			1
i ca n't see a surprise winner like @entity243 in 2012			0
it was a once - in - a - lifetime fairytale when a team of unknown players beat sides like @entity225 and @entity176 against all the odds			0
@entity251 , with my good friend @entity249 in charge , is a team that could potentially go all the way			0
its physical strength is known to anybody who watches @entity12 football , but @entity258 has formed a unit which has also improved tactically			0
@entity37 has a decent side but it 's not a team that has the level required to become @entity12 champions			1
fans one of the big differences between the @entity267 and @entity5 is the attendance and the atmosphere in the stadiums			1
why do you see so many empty seats in the stadiums ? @entity16 is a huge continent and connections from one country to the other by plane , train or car can be quite complicated and can take hours or even days			0
the travel costs are also very expensive and sometimes connections between @entity12 countries are easier with a stopover in @entity57			0
likewise , an average @entity12 worker would never be able to afford the airfare , while accommodation can be completely overpriced			0
a very average hotel room during the 2010 @entity5 was sometimes more than $ 500			1
ticket prices at @entity5 are also too high for fans			1
a normal ticket costs many times more than local fans would normally pay for tickets at a domestic league game			0
average @entity12 fans just ca n't afford to pay such prices for a football game			0
poverty forces people to buy food or medication instead of spending crazy money on a football match			0
every match of the host nation is traditionally a sell - out crowd , and as long as the host is still in the tournament , the attendances are decent			1
but when the home team is eliminated , you sometimes get the feeling that the football in the country has just died , with local supporters losing immediate interest in the tournament			2
these days , @entity12 fan culture gravitates towards many of them supporting @entity33 teams			0
so much so , that the @entity320 means much more to @entity12 fans than @entity5			2
who cares to watch @entity37 against @entity251 if you can see @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 or @entity327 at the same time on television ? @entity12 football , therefore , has a real struggle competing against the major @entity33 leagues , with @entity332 , @entity333 and @entity334 now the true idols of @entity12 fans .			2
