-- @entity4 ' $ 100 million @entity3 - directed thriller @entity1 blasted off on its opening weekend at the box office , scoring a stunning $ 55.6 million from 3,575 theaters			1
the sci - fi title , which stars @entity9 and @entity10 , set a new october opening weekend record , surpassing @entity13 's $ 52.6 million debut in 2011			1
gravity also marks the best - ever debut for both of its stars , beating @entity9 's $ 39.1 million start for this summer 's @entity19 ( talk about having a great year at the box office ! ) and @entity10 's $ 42.9 million debut for @entity22 in 1997			1
and to put a cherry on top of @entity4 ' incredible weekend , audiences issued @entity1 an excellent " a- " @entity27 grade , which will yield great word - of - mouth for weeks to come			1
the film played to a much broader audience than most young - male - dominated sci - fi films			1
crowds were 54 percent male and 46 percent female , and 59 percent were above the age of 35			2
@entity38 showings accounted for a whopping 80 percent of the film 's weekend gross ( bucking the downward trend @entity38 has faced this year and proving that audiences will pay for the format if they feel it 's worth it )			1
@entity47 tickets made up 20 percent of revenue — because if there 's one thing that looks great on a big screen , it 's outer space			2
@entity54 dropped 37 percent in its second weekend to $ 21.5 million , which gives the animated title a $ 60.6 million total after 10 days			0
@entity58 spent $ 78 million on the saucy sequel and wisely scheduled it away from other family competition , which should allow it to thrive throughout october			0
( by comparison , films like @entity63 and @entity64 got choked out this summer while competing with each other and @entity67			2
) the next animated film to arrive in theaters , @entity69 , wo n't come out until nov. 1			2
@entity70 and @entity71 faltered in third place with their new crime drama @entity73 , which earned a weak $ 7.6 million in its first three days			1
both stars are hotter than ever : @entity70 , after winning an @entity82 for @entity83 and landing the @entity85 role in @entity4 ' upcoming @entity87 sequel , and @entity71 , after hitting no. 1 with his comeback album @entity81 , the sequel to which is projected to be the no. 1 album this week			1
but nothing about @entity73 inspired crowds to check it out in theaters			1
audiences issued the poorly reviewed film , which cost @entity95 about $ 30 million , a weak " c " cinemascore grade			2
prisoners and @entity98 made up the rest of the @entity100			0
prisoners fell 48 percent to $ 5.7 million , giving the @entity103 vehicle a $ 47.9 million total against a $ 46 million budget			0
the film earned excellent reviews , but has had trouble holding on to audiences due to the arrival of @entity98 , @entity111 , and gravity — three well - reviewed dramas attracting attention			1
fortunately , @entity115 is holding on better than one of those films , @entity98 , which fell 56 percent this weekend to $ 4.4 million			2
the @entity119 racing drama starring @entity120 and directed by @entity121 has now earned $ 18.1 million total and will fall short of its $ 38 million budget			0
