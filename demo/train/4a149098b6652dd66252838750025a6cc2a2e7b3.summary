@entity0 -- consider tonight 's speech by president @entity3 to be the antidote to his now - infamous comments two weeks ago that his administration lacks a strategy for combating @entity8 in @entity9			1
the beheadings of two @entity11 -- journalists @entity12 and @entity14 -- have propelled isis into the center of the @entity11 public consciousness			1
the group is no longer a distant , local threat , but an immediate threat to @entity11 lives			1
@entity3 knows he must now give a comprehensive answer to this threat			1
is @entity8 a threat to the @entity11 ? first , he will need to explain to @entity11 to what degree @entity8 threatens @entity11 national security			1
the administration 's current assessment is that , for now , it is principally a threat to the region , as well as to @entity11 diplomats , soldiers and other personnel based in @entity34			2
however , the @entity11 intelligence community believes @entity8 also threatens @entity11 interests outside the region , including in the @entity11 homeland			1
@entity39 : 10 questions for @entity3 on @entity8 intelligence officials tell me that while @entity8 is focused on strengthening the @entity44 state , or caliphate , in @entity9 and @entity34 , this does not mean its aspirations end there			1
@entity8 is believed to be encouraging the many foreigners now fighting for it ( including about a dozen @entity11 ) and other sympathizers to carry out attacks in the @entity51 when they return home			1
when i asked defense secretary @entity54 last week whether @entity8 is a threat to the @entity11 today or some day down the road , he said the administration does n't have the luxury of making that distinction			1
" we ca n't take a chance , @entity63 , on saying , ' well , let 's technically define this -- is it a real threat today or tomorrow , or is it going to be in six months ? ' " @entity60 said			0
" that 's the way the threats do n't work in little , neat boxes and emanate on our time frame			0
they emanate on their time frame			0
we know they 're a threat			0
we know they 're brutal			0
we know that they are , as i 've said , as others have said , something that we 've never seen before			0
" what 's @entity3 's strategy ? second , the president will need to lay out in detail his strategy for dealing with @entity8			1
this follows another confusing rhetorical moment for the @entity87			0
@entity3 is open to airstrikes on @entity8 officials including the president now say the goal is " degrading and destroying @entity8 , " but only after the president indicated last week that his goal may be simply to make @entity8 a more " manageable " threat			1
now that the goal is to defeat @entity8 , exactly what steps will the president order to accomplish that ? sources tell @entity1 he is " open to " ordering airstrikes inside @entity9			2
and @entity60 told me in our interview that the @entity104 has already presented him with military options to do so			0
@entity107 : ' @entity108 ' of nations will help fight @entity8 we also now know that the president is asking for so - called @entity112 authority to arm and train @entity9 rebel groups			2
however , the president has said , and will likely repeat tonight , that military action alone will not accomplish his goals			0
he needs an international coalition , particularly involving regional states directly involved in the conflict			0
he needs a more inclusive government in @entity34			0
and he needs a continuing and broad humanitarian mission to serve the many @entity34 and @entity9 that @entity8 is driving from their homes , starving and murdering			2
@entity107 's mission : @entity125 buy - in for @entity127 efforts how long will this fight last ? finally , @entity3 will need to explain to @entity11 how long and how intense this new war will be			1
he campaigned on ending the long @entity11 wars in @entity34 and @entity131			2
until very recently , his administration continued to emphasize that @entity11 are war - weary and that the administration was loathe to bring the nation back to war , short of very direct threats to @entity11 interests			2
remember the administration 's -- also infamous -- mantra " do n't do stupid stuff " as the driving force of the president 's foreign policy			0
now , the president is taking the nation back to war			0
for how long ? how costly will it be ? as a candidate in 2007 , he famously called @entity34 " a dumb war			0
" why wo n't this war be dumb ? opinion : could @entity3 's plan against @entity8 spark backlash ? round - up : did @entity3 sell his @entity8 strategy ?			1

beheadings of two @entity11 put @entity8 into @entity11 ' consciousness
@entity3 must explain to public the threat @entity8 presents
the president must also lay out what his strategy is for *eliminating* the @entity8 threat
