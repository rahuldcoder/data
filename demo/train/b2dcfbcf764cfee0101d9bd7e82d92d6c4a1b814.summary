the @entity39 came closest to scoring in the first half as @entity10 's 25 - yard free - kick forced a fine save from @entity3 goalkeeper @entity43			2
however , the @entity45 ' dominance of possession -- they had an incredible 70 percent of the play -- finally told , with players lining up to take potshots at @entity4 's goal			0

@entity69 netted twice to give @entity8 a 2 - 0 halftime lead before @entity71 pulled one back , but @entity73 crashed a spectacular late goal to make it 3 - 1 and substitute @entity76 set up a tense finish			1
striker @entity69 netted the opener from close range in the ninth minute after @entity80 pounced on @entity83 's poor back - pass and rounded goalkeeper @entity81			0
he then scored a tournament - leading eighth goal in the 31st minute with a powerful header from @entity88 's cross			0
@entity89 hit the post for @entity20 in the second half before fellow substitute @entity92 reduced the deficit in the 73rd minute after a pass into the penalty area from @entity96			0
@entity97 and @entity98 both squandered golden chances to level , the latter from a simple header , and @entity8 made the most of their escapes when @entity73 crashed in a shot off the underside of the crossbar in the 81st minute			0
@entity109 's lapse allowed @entity76 to comfortably sidefoot home just three minutes later , but it was @entity8 who looked most likely to score again as @entity113 smashed a fierce long - range shot against the bar in time added on .			2
