-- the world 's largest professional social network just got a wider reach -- and it wants to be in front of your face for more of the day			2
@entity7 launched its long - awaited @entity9 app late wednesday , along with revamped versions of its @entity12 and @entity13 apps			1
redesigned from the ground up , the tablet version looks nothing like the @entity7 website ; it 's more akin to a social news aggregator			1
" this was a chance to go back to the drawing board , " says @entity19 , @entity7 's social media manager			1
" to design it for how people use the @entity9 : morning and night infotainment			0
" the app 's main screen is a clean , simple interface with just three options : updates , profile and inbox			2
the latter two are self - explanatory , although it 's worth mentioning that the list of people who 've looked at your profile -- a voyeuristic option hidden deep on the website -- is front and center here			0
it 's " updates " where the app shines , and turns into a kind of socially - enhanced @entity45			0
you see stories your friends have shared , beautifully laid out , alongside such nuggets of news as which of your friends have changed their jobs recently			0
( download it in the app store here			0
) the app also pulls in details of the day ahead from your @entity61 or @entity62 calendar			1
@entity7 expects you 'll use it over breakfast , when you 're torn between work and news , as well as take it to meetings			1
it 's been a long time coming -- longer even than the much - delayed @entity9 app. @entity7 has 150 million users , and the @entity9 is the fastest growing device on the network			2
more than 22 % of @entity7 traffic comes from mobile devices ; a year ago , that figure was 8 %			1
what do you make of the @entity78 app ? will you use it ? let us know in the comments			0
