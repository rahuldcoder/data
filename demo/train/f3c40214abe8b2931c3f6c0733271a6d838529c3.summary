@entity0 , @entity1 -- a design issue rather than poor maintenance is likely to blame for the mid-flight failure of a @entity10 airliner 's engine , the ceo of the @entity1 carrier said friday			1
one of the four engines on the @entity10 @entity12 shut down six minutes after takeoff thursday from @entity15 's @entity14 , forcing it to return and make an emergency landing			1

but while above the western @entity22 island of @entity23 , part of the engine 's covering , or cowling , tore off			2
" this issue does not relate to maintenance ; this is an engine issue , " ceo @entity28 told reporters friday			0
" and the engines have been maintained by @entity33 since they 've been installed on the aircraft			2
" " so we believe that this is probably most likely a material failure or some sort of design issue that we 're tracking and trying to understand , " he added			0
" we do n't believe this is related to maintenance in any way			0
" on friday , @entity12 announced that it had asked all operators of @entity44 with @entity33 engines to inspect them as a precaution			1
following the @entity10 ceo 's comments , a @entity33 spokesman referred back to his company 's earlier news statement , which said : " since @entity51 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to @entity14 , we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities			1
in situations like these , @entity33 has well established processes to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions			2
" after the incident , @entity10 -- @entity1 's national airline -- grounded its @entity12 fleet			1
the airline said flights of the twin - deck planes -- the world 's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation is complete			1
on friday , @entity69 said @entity10 hopes to resume @entity12 flights within 48 hours , after completing engine safety checks			1
" we believe over the next 24 to 48 hours , those checks will be complete on all of the @entity44 , and if we do n't find any adverse findings out of the checks , the aircraft will resume operations , " he said			1
@entity10 has six @entity44 in its fleet of 191 planes			2
@entity12 will at some point deliver 14 more , the airline said			0
passengers on the detoured @entity10 flight spent the night in @entity15 , then flew to @entity1 on friday			0
