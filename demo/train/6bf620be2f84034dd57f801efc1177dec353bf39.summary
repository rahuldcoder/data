@entity0 -- the @entity2 filed a civil contempt lawsuit against attorney general @entity4 on monday seeking the release of documents linked to a controversial weapons crackdown			1
the lawsuit asks a federal court judge to rule that president @entity10 overstepped his authority in claiming executive privilege over documents sought by the committee in its investigation of the @entity17 weapons tracking program			1
the lawsuit also seeks an order requiring @entity4 to turn the documents over to @entity2 investigators			1
" waiting nearly eight months after the subpoena had been issued to assert a meritless claim of privilege , the president 's decision was a calculated political maneuver designed to stop the release of documents until after november 's elections , @entity2 chairman @entity22 , @entity23 , said in a statement			1
no criminal prosecution of @entity4 for contempt the lawsuit stems from a contempt of @entity38 citation passed by the @entity2 last month , and was expected			0
the @entity2 resolution gave lawmakers the option of filing a lawsuit if the @entity43 declined to file criminal charges against @entity4			0
@entity45 say the @entity46 is using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting @entity4 and @entity10 in an election year			0
" this partisan lawsuit wastes taxpayer dollars and resources , and is a distraction from the urgent business before @entity38 : acting to create jobs and grow our economy , " @entity51 @entity50 said in a written statement			2
" it is also designed to distract the @entity43 from its critical job of challenging state laws designed to restrict the rights of @entity65 to vote			0
" @entity43 director of public affairs @entity66 said in a statement that @entity4 's department had been " always willing to work with the @entity2 , instead the @entity2 and the @entity69 have said they prefer to litigate			0
" the @entity71 launched the @entity17 program in @entity73 to track weapons purchases by @entity76 drug cartels			1
it followed similar programs started in the @entity80 administration			0
the program lost track of more than 1,000 firearms , two of which turned up in the 2010 killing of @entity87 agent @entity17			2
@entity17 investigation started with agent 's death the @entity43 announced on july 6 that it would not prosecute			2
the department said it has had a longstanding position across administrations of both parties not to proceed with prosecution when a president has asserted executive privilege , as @entity10 did			1
executive privilege refers to a president 's authority to refuse to comply with some demands from lawmakers and judges to turn over documents and other materials			1
the @entity10 administration said it was asserting the doctrine in the @entity17 case to shield documents that include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes			1
@entity22 said the president was violating his promise to operate openly			0
" after promising an unprecedented level of transparency , the president is attempting to expand the reach of executive privilege to obstruct the truth about the reckless conduct that contributed to the death of a border patrol agent and countless @entity76 citizens , " @entity22 said			1
" the family of @entity87 agent @entity17 , whistleblowers who faced retaliation for exposing the @entity43 's reckless tactics , and the public have a right to know the full extent of what occurred			2
" house speaker @entity132 applauded the filing			0
" after providing -- then retracting -- inaccurate information to @entity38 , attorney general holder has gone to extraordinary lengths to block access to subpoenaed documents and deny the efforts of the @entity17 family to get the truth , " he said in a statement			2
@entity143 : @entity38 's @entity4 vote like historical evils the showdown between @entity22 and @entity4 over the program dates to subpoenas issued last year by the @entity149 seeking a wide range of documents and other materials			1
eventually , the committee reduced its demand to focus on documents involving decision - making after the administration shut down the @entity17 program			1
in particular , the committee wanted documents relating to the period after february 2011 , when the @entity43 sent @entity38 an erroneous letter -- later withdrawn -- that said top officials knew nothing about @entity17 until early that year			2
executive privilege : a rocky legal and political road in @entity65 history in july , @entity22 conceded that investigators lack evidence that @entity4 knew of the failed weapons - tracking tactics of @entity17			1
the contempt citation , he said , was for @entity4 's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents			0
" it 's not for what the attorney general knew about @entity17 , " @entity22 said			0
" it 's about the attorney general 's refusal to provide the documents			0
" @entity183 press secretary @entity182 said last month that @entity22 's comment showed the contempt citation was about politics			0
the truth about the @entity17 scandal @entity1 's @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
