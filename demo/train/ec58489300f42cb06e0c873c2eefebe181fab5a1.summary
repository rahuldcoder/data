-- the nation 's suburban schools added 3.4 million students to their rolls over the past 15 years -- and nearly all of them were minorities , according to a study released tuesday			1

yet the new arrivals resulted in only a modest increase in the individual schools ' racial and ethnic diversity , the study said			1
" the school districts look like they are more diverse , but within your school districts , if the whites are in one school , the blacks in a different school and the @entity25 in yet a different school , it does n't necessarily mean the suburban whites have more black and @entity33 classmates -- because they do n't go to the same school , " said @entity17 , senior research associate at the @entity18 in @entity10 , who wrote the report			0
using federal government data , @entity17 found that minority students made up 99 percent of the increase in suburban school enrollment between the 1993 - 94 and 2006 - 07 school years			1
during that time , the student body at the nation 's suburban schools went from 72 percent white to 59 percent white ; from 12 percent black to 15 percent black ; from 11 percent @entity33 to 20 percent @entity33 ; and from 5 percent @entity42 to 6 percent @entity42			2
the diversity , however , is not reflected at the individual school level			0
for example , in 2006 - 07 , the typical white suburban student attended a school whose student body was 75 percent white , down from 83 percent white in 1993 - 94 , @entity17 wrote			1
" so at a time when the white share of student enrollment in suburban school districts was falling by 13 percentage points , the exposure of the typical white suburban student to minority students in his or her own school was growing by a little more than half that much -- or 8 percentage points , " the report said			1
from another point of view , the typical black suburban student attended a school in 2006 - 07 that was 34 percent white , down from 43 percent white in 1993 - 94			1
but @entity25 suburban students tended to become more segregated over the same time period -- in 2006 - 07 , the typical such student was in a school that was 49 percent @entity25 , versus 42 percent @entity25 in 1993 - 94			1
suburban schools accounted for most of the change in demographics , according to the study , accounting for two - thirds of the 5.1 million increase in the number of students nationwide over that time period			1
city schools tended to be more segregated than their suburban counterparts , the study said , with the typical urban black student attending a school with 60 percent black enrollees ; and the typical @entity25 student attending a school with 63 percent @entity25 enrollment			1
minority students in rural areas and in towns tended to be more exposed to whites than were their suburban counterparts			0
the typical black student in a town or rural area attended a school where whites composed 47 percent of the student body and blacks 44 percent			0
the typical @entity25 student in a town or rural area attended a school where whites made up 43 percent of the student body , and @entity102 made up 47 percent			2
asians in suburban schools saw only a slight uptick in isolation -- from 23 percent @entity42 to 24 percent @entity42 over the time period			0
however , " white students are n't going to school with as many black and @entity33 students as the aggregate school district enrollment numbers indicate , " @entity17 said in a telephone interview			2
school diversity has long been considered an important marker of racial equality in education			0
" when students of different racial / ethnic backgrounds do not attend the same schools , the potential exists that they also may not attend the same type of schools , i.e. , schools of similar quality and level of resources , " @entity17 wrote			2
" racial differences in school quality ... can not exist if schools are racially balanced			1
" the study identified the nation 's most - segregated suburban school district as @entity134 - @entity133 in suburban @entity135 , @entity136 , based on its " dissimilarity index " of 0.79			1
that index means that 79 percent of the district 's minority students would have to be moved to different schools in order for the schools ' student bodies to mirror the ethnic makeup of the surrounding population , he said			0
the 0.74 figure for suburban @entity151 , @entity149 's , @entity148 means " you would have to move about three - quarters of @entity148 's black students to a different school " in order to get racial balance , he said			2
calls to school superintendents in both districts were not immediately returned			0
" the suburbs seem to have grown a lot more diverse , " @entity17 concluded			0
" the place you 'd expect to see it is among kids			0
but when you actually look at where kids go to school , it 's not clear that white kids are going to school with a whole bunch more different classmates than they used to -- a little bit more , but not as much as the aggregate measures would suggest			0

minorities made up 99 percent of increase in suburban school rolls , study says
diversity rose , but typical white suburban students attend 75 percent - white schools
expert : racial differences in schools " can not exist if schools are racially balanced "
most - segregated suburban district lies in suburban @entity135 , @entity136 , study finds
