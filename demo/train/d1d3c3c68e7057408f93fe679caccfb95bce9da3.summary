-- " it was booked as a @entity2 tour , but the stages were too small			1
" @entity4 explains -- as only he can -- his current @entity6 comedy act with @entity7			1
they 're calling it " two kids , @entity11			2
" " they could only fit two - and - a - half of us , " he says , " so we fired two - and - a - half , and the other guy did n't want to come as a half			2
after some contract negotiation , it became @entity7 and @entity18 " longtime fans of the legendary @entity21 sketch comedy group know the full cast as also including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
( @entity4 did n't specify which of these three was asked to be half a man on the tour , but the smart money is on @entity23			1
) from 1989 to 1995 , the @entity2 enjoyed tv success , and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore			1
for instance , if you 've ever crushed somebody 's head , you , sir , have enjoyed a @entity2 moment			1
there 's plenty more from their catalog of absurdity , and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the @entity47			2
but if you 're looking for a place to start , this author 's personal favorite is a sketch called " @entity52			2
" and my friend @entity53 favors one called " @entity55			0
" so , here , now , you have some @entity2 advice from somebody named @entity53 , and somebody with the last name @entity60			2
feel free to touch us			0
despite being known for their sketches , the current @entity7 / @entity4 tour is actually more focused on stand - up comedy			1
@entity7 says , " i never liked it until very recently			2
i always felt too exposed and out of control			0
" it 's definitely something new for @entity7 and @entity4 , and , perhaps , even more new for their fans			1
but the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show			0
and it certainly came out when we sat down with them in @entity79 before their performances at @entity82			0
as you 'll see in our video , @entity7 and @entity4 feed off each other with ease , often completing each other 's thoughts			1
certainly , like all comedy , the @entity2 are n't for everyone , but there 's no denying their success ; especially if catching the eye of a young @entity94 is the barometer of that success			1
@entity7 recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group 's career			1
" @entity94 at the time was the sexiest woman in the world , " he says			0
" we had never met a celebrity before			0
we all thought she wanted to sleep with us			0
it really was a big launching pad for us			0
it made us think that wow , we 're in the big leagues			0
she was the first responder			0
" she did n't sleep with them .			0
