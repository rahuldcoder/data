-- all the world 's a stage , @entity1 wrote long before television came into view			2
everyone will be famous for 15 minutes , @entity6 added a few centuries later			2
which leads us inexorably to @entity10 and @entity13 's exuberant @entity12 posting : " honored to be at the @entity14 for the state dinner in honor of @entity17 with president @entity18 and our first lady ! " they have the pictures to prove it , and the overnight fame , too			1
the @entity25 , with a @entity27 camera crew in tow , apparently were trying to ratchet up their prospects for the cable network 's upcoming " @entity30 " if only the @entity25 were the exception			2
but the modern - day reality show genre , spearheaded nearly a decade ago by the first edition of @entity36 ' " @entity35 , " has become a tidal wave of cost - efficient tv programming starring ... pretty much anyone			1
its inhabitants increasingly are called on to step up the pace in pursuit of myriad available slots on networks large , small and sometimes desperate			1
stand out in a crowd , or be pushed aside by someone who will			2
crashing a @entity14 state dinner has proved to be just the ticket for the fame - craving @entity25			1
their audacious breach of @entity54 security has trumped the reality show aspirations of the " balloon boy " family and possibly even knocked @entity58 out of the " @entity60 " spotlight for a day or two			1
what does this say about us as a people ? well , the quest for fame is hardly new			1
nor is our collective fascination with train wrecks			0
what 's changed is the escalation in available venues			1
there 's seemingly no limit to the number of enablers out there			0
hitting it big with a " reality " franchise can work wonders for a tv network 's bottom line , overall visibility -- or both			1
@entity87 , @entity86 was @entity86			0
you actually could learn something by watching its instructional and educational programming			0
but the network gradually got out of that business			0
and it hit the mother lode with " @entity96 , " which eventually became the public face of a broken marriage while making the @entity100 internationally famous			1
@entity27 , home to the ever - expanding " @entity102 " franchise , used to devote itself to the performing arts			2
that began to change in a hurry after @entity108 took control of the network in 2002			0
the network now offers a virtual wall - to - wall reality lineup , with only occasional intrusions from " inside the @entity114 , " the only remaining evidence of what @entity27 used to be			1
@entity117 originally launched as the @entity117			0
believe it or not , it once housed an anthology series , " @entity125 , " that brought its audience plays , concerts , documentaries and even opera			0
the reality bug long since has bitten hard , though , with the once high - minded cable outlet now best known for " @entity128 , intervention " and " @entity130			1
" @entity131 used to be nothing but music videos			0
" @entity135 " changed everything			0
@entity108 had a long and well - earned reputation for emmy - caliber comedies and dramas such as " @entity139 , " " @entity140 , " " @entity141 , " " @entity142 , " " @entity143 " and " @entity144			2
" now its most popular attraction , other than " @entity146 , " is a weekly two - hour dose of " @entity148 , " where little other than size matters			2
against this backdrop , the @entity25 in a way are only acting naturally			0
that 's lamentable , a sad commentary , an appalling sign of our times , etc. , etc. but tv has created -- and continues to create -- a bottomless pit of venues where preeners are prized commodities and abnormal behavior is not only encouraged but intrinsic to the common goal			1
the lone exception these days appears to be major league baseball			0
when a goofball fan runs out onto the field , the cameras turn away so as not to reward the trespasser with a minute or two of national or regional exposure			0
too bad it 'll never catch on			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			1

reality shows are a low - cost form of *entertainment* for tv networks , says @entity175
he says the shows encourage people to do attention - getting *stunts*
@entity175 says the @entity14 gate crashers topped " @entity96 " and the " balloon boy " story
tv has created a " bottomless pit " of venues for abnormal behavior , @entity175 says
