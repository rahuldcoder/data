if the reports are true , and somehow the @entity3 deflated 11 balls in the @entity5 , then shame on me			1
screw them , and shame on me			2
i am 42 , and have been a @entity3 fan for 42 years , plus nine months when you include that prenatal season			1
( while your mother was listening to @entity11 , mine was listening to @entity12 talk about @entity13			2
) in fact , at this point in my life , i essentially do only three things : 1 ) anchor at @entity0 , 2 ) help raise twin 7 - year - old boys and 3 ) root for @entity22 sports teams			1
and if i am being honest , the one i am best at is no. 3			2
i am a really good @entity24 sports fan			1
and the @entity3 are ruining all my hard work , debasing my skills and tainting the hours upon hours of joy that fandom gave me			1
this is an existential crisis			1
how can you root for a cheater ? how can you award malfeasance ? how can you cheer a con ? you ca n't			1
at least you should n't			2
i should n't cheer for the @entity3			1
i know that , no matter what my genetic coding says			2
i am not going to dwell on the specifics of the accusations , or the physics of what advantage you get from deflated footballs			1
the fact is , if the reports are true , the balls the @entity3 used had way too little air in them			1
well below what the league allows			2
well below what the rules allow			2
and if they did it deliberately -- and i am struggling to think of any way it could have happened otherwise -- there is a word for that : cheating			2
and how can you root for a cheater ? you ca n't			1
at least you should n't			0
for all the @entity3 playoff games this year , my sons and i have all donned our no. 12 @entity68 jerseys			1
we wore them because @entity68 is so darn good , so darn handsome and so full of the values of hard work and perseverance that you want your sports icons to embody			0
did he have any knowledge or any involvement in deflating footballs ? oh @entity79 , i hope not			0
but can i guarantee you that he did n't ? nope			0
so how can i wear his jersey for the @entity84 ? i ca n't			0
at least i should n't			0
the worst part of this is , deep down inside , i might have known all this already			0
the @entity3 have a history of pushing the limits			1
( do i now really just have to call it cheating ? ) they were penalized and sanctioned for illegally videotaping an opposing team			0
i managed to compartmentalize that , buy my kids their @entity3 gear and cheer for them anyway , perhaps hoping that it was some kind of anomaly			1
it does n't look like it was			0
i know football is just a game , and the @entity3 demolished the @entity102 45 - 7 , and clearly would have beaten them even if they played with a ball made of marshmallow fluff			1
but that just makes it worse			0
they did n't need to cheat			0
look , no one needs to cheat			0
it is a choice , and it is the wrong choice			0
and it is not a choice i want to condone somehow -- tacitly or otherwise -- to my 7 - year - old boys			0
i have spent so much emotional capital and enthusiasm raising them as @entity3 fans while living in @entity118 , and now i am beginning to regret it			1
i fear i have led them down the path to the dark side			0
maybe they can still be saved			0
being a sports fan is not a purely rational thing			2
do i want the @entity3 to lose the @entity84 ? no. i am just not wired that way			1
but i know i should			0
and that is why i am ashamed			0

reports the @entity3 used deflated balls create existential crisis for @entity132
the *lifelong* @entity3 fan asks how he can still root for a cheater ?
