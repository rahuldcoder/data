-- when music superstar @entity2 hits the road for a tour these days he brings along more than just the music			1
the latin music crossover sensation has joined forces with a unique organization -- @entity10 , a self - proclaimed " rock ' n ' roll cancer organization " whose goal is to " save lives one concert at a time			1
" @entity2 invited the group on tour with him to set up shop at his concerts and perform bone - marrow donation drives as a part of its " @entity28 " campaign to find donors for the @entity27			1
" when you go up on stage and you look at my fans , it 's so diverse ethnically , and i thought it would be perfect , " @entity2 says			1
" i thought we would get people of different races to be able to register for this organization , and i thought that would really help			2
" the diversity of his audience is exactly why the partnership with @entity2 is so vital to the @entity10 's mission			1
" only 10 % of the overall national marrow registry is made up of @entity46 population			0
so when you 're @entity46 looking for a transplant , your chances of finding a match significantly decrease due to the lack of that population on the registry , " says executive director @entity47			0
" so by reaching out to a community through someone like @entity2 , who has such an incredible @entity46 following , we 're able to register people to the database that we never could before			2
" @entity2 is now well - established in the world of entertainment , and he realizes that this is a powerful place that can be used for the benefit of others			2
" i think you reach a certain age where you feel responsible			0
you can communicate with your fans especially nowadays with @entity70 , with @entity71 , all these ways , and obviously the live shows , so any time i feel like i can do something that 's positive and that 's good , it 's a good thing , " @entity2 says			2
the lhs team sets up a table with plenty of information about bone - marrow donation and then asks concert - goers as they pass if they would like to sign up			1
once a volunteer ensures they meet the requirements for donation , one of the @entity10 team members takes a cotton - tipped swab and swabs the inside of the donor 's mouth			1
that 's all it takes , and the donor can carry on to enjoy the show			0
if a match is found , the donor will then be notified and then possibly help to save a life			0
" what i hope to take away from this experience is people realize that it 's important , that they can actually make a huge impact			0
and we 've got to register as many people as possible , and there 's a lot of people out there , a lot of kids , that need this , " says @entity2			0
@entity10 is an international organization that raises awareness for the needs of cancer patients worldwide			1
rock ' n ' roll is at the very roots of @entity10 , as it was co-founded in 2007 by leukemia survivor @entity122 of the @entity124 rock band @entity125 and his friend and fellow survivor @entity126			1
the men created this organization to ensure that awareness , early detection and proper treatment are not a luxury but instead available to all in need worldwide			0
in addition to the " @entity139 " campaign that the group carries out at rock concerts , @entity10 builds and supports cancer centers all over the globe			1
@entity10 purchased the first mammography machine ever in @entity143 and funded a mobile unit for cancer screenings in remote parts of @entity147			2
the group also performs concerts in extreme locations like @entity151			0
