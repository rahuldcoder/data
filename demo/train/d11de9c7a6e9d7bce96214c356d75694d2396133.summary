through shirt sponsorship deals , @entity1 announced one of the biggest -- and most controversial -- in their history			1
the club has signed a four - year contract with ' digital finance company ' @entity11 , a pay - day firm one mp claims is nothing more than a " legal loan shark			1
" named as the number one company in the @entity20 list in 2011 , @entity11 lends money with an annual interest rate of 4,124 %			2
the company , which is named after a slang term for money in @entity24 , declined to comment when contacted by @entity0			0
" we are completely transparent about the total cost of repayment and we make money when our customers repay us quickly , not by continually extending a growing line of credit , " says @entity11 's website			1
" like all companies we make the odd mistake , but we are serious about our commitment to responsible lending and try to put customers at the heart of what we do			0
" as well as sponsoring @entity1 's shirts , @entity11 has also bought the naming rights to the @entity41 ' stadium , reverting it back to its original @entity44 name			1
the club 's owner @entity45 sparked a huge wave of protest from fans when he discarded 119 years of history by calling the ground the @entity44 , after his sports goods firm , back in 2011			0
several key figures have criticized @entity45 for striking the deal , saying it is irresponsible for such a big institution in a traditionally deprived area to carry the name of a firm that preys on vulnerable people			0
the partnership -- said to be worth $ 38m over four years -- underlines how increasingly important shirt deals are to top clubs , with a study by @entity65 showing they had pushed through the eur 500m ( $ 643m ) barrier in @entity68 for the first time in 2012			1
@entity65 's report also reveals the most common shirt sponsor of @entity4 clubs are firms from the betting and lottery sector , products of which are featured on the strips of six teams			1
@entity24 sports business expert @entity80 told @entity0 one of the most important goals for sponsors is getting as many people as possible to see their brand name			0
the @entity4 , with its estimated 4.7 billion viewers a year , is the perfect vehicle , he said			2
" such is the global prominence of the @entity4 and the clubs within it , that shirt sponsors predictably and inevitably secure the ' eyeballs ' they seek by engaging in sponsorship deals			1
" in particular , there is a preponderance of gambling companies , largely because of the convergence of consumer interest in both football and gambling			0
" in the case of @entity1 , there would appear to be an alignment of club and company expectations			2
" for the club , the deal is an immediate source of revenue and also a smart way of returning @entity1 's stadium back to its @entity44 name ; for the sponsor , given the socio - demographic and economic conditions of certain parts of the north - east , it is one way of targeting actual and potential customers			1
" @entity121 currently holds the record for the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal -- the @entity124 pays the @entity126 giants $ 38 million a year to have their logo emblazoned on the famous red and blue strip			1
@entity131 clubs @entity129 and @entity132 both attract $ 32 million a year in shirt deals , from @entity134 and @entity135 respectively , while @entity121 's @entity126 rivals @entity136 receive $ 29m from betting firm @entity137			1
@entity1 's commercial income trails way behind those clubs despite their windfall from @entity11 but according to @entity142 's @entity141 member of parliament @entity143 , it is the wrong message to have on their shirts			1
" some of the richest young men in @entity1 to wear shirts calling on the poorest to go to a legal loan shark , " she said on micro-blogging site @entity148			2
her @entity142 colleague , @entity153 , agreed and called on the government to cap the interest rate companies like @entity11 could charge			2
" pay - day lenders prey on the most vulnerable people in society , namely those on low incomes or unemployed , " she said on her official website			0
" i know of many cases where constituents have turned to pay - day lenders in desperation and find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt at excessive interest rates of over 4,000 % per annum			0
" during this double - dip recession , @entity11 have seen their profits soar as many households struggle to make their income stretch to cover the rising costs of living			2
" i am disappointed that the board has chosen to associate our club , brand and city with practices which too often penalise struggling families			0
" i worry that by associating the club with such a company , it could normalize their practice and plunge many more families into the cycle of debt			0
many will see this deal as money from misery			0
" over the last two years @entity193 , the @entity142 mp for @entity194 -- who dubbed pay - day loan companies as " legal loan sharks " -- has led a campaign against @entity11 , including its sponsorship of the @entity200 and @entity201 football clubs			1
@entity202 want the government to impose a legal cap on lending rates as happens in most other @entity207 countries .			0
