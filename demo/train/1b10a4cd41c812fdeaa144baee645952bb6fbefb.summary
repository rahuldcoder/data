-- we 've all heard that @entity2 is gov. @entity3 's running mate			1
but many still do n't know the details of his proposals for health care reform			1
they offer a stark contrast to what the @entity10 administration would like to do			1
@entity12 @entity12 is a defined benefit program			1
that means the federal government decides each year what @entity12 will cover			1
no matter what that costs , the government pays for most of it ; individuals are responsible for the rest			0
@entity2 's original plan , passed by the @entity24 ( but not the @entity25 ) last year , would have changed @entity12 to a defined contribution program , where the government would instead decide every year what it will pay			1
under his plan , the government would give seniors that amount of money , in one form or another , to buy insurance on their own			1
seniors would have had to pay for the difference between the cost of the insurance and the amount the government was willing to pay			1
the problem was that his original plan saved money by limiting how quickly the voucher seniors would get to buy health care would grow			1
this meant that by 2030 , seniors would have been responsible for 68 % of the cost of their insurance , likely too much for most to afford			2
at the end of 2011 , though , @entity2 made significant alterations to his proposal			2
with @entity56 sen. @entity55 , he produced a plan that more closely resembles @entity3 's ( although he changed things again in his 2013 budget , which @entity55 does not support )			2
instead of tying the amount of the voucher to an arbitrary increase in the future , it would be tied , in his 2011 proposal , to how much insurance costs			0
each year , companies will submit bids for how much it will cost to provide insurance for a senior that year			0
the voucher would then be set at the price of the second - lowest bid			0
in other words , seniors could get the second - cheapest plan for very little			2
if they chose the cheapest plan , they would actually get a rebate			0
if they want anything more expensive , they would have to pay for the difference			0
moreover , traditional @entity12 will be one of the choices			2
if it is the second cheapest , not much will change			0
if , however , it is more expensive , then seniors would have to pay for the difference , but in this way they will have the option to keep their @entity12			1
there are potential concerns , however			0
the first is that the proposal requires that the plans be " actuarially equivalent , " but not that they provide the same coverage benefits			0
this means that plans can tweak benefits they offer to try to preferentially attract healthy customers			0
the second issue is that this plan wo n't save near the money that @entity2 's first attempt did			1
if this plan had been implemented in 2009 , it would have saved the federal government 9 % that year			0
but that would have been a one - time savings , and it would n't bend the cost curve much at all			0
moreover , seniors would have had to pay about $ 64 a month for their traditional @entity12 , which is a significant amount for many of them			1
a third concern , voiced by many who oppose the @entity2 plan , is that the details are insufficient to assume that traditional @entity12 will be preserved			1
there may be a good reason for this : if the @entity122 is too radical for many wishing to pass this proposal into law , it 's hard to imagine they 'll be in a position to defend something far more specific and comprehensive			0
most significantly , though , this whole plan rests on the same rationale as @entity130 did ( it lets @entity12 beneficiaries get their coverage through private insurance companies ) when president @entity134 first proposed it			1
that did n't clearly work			0
many private plans were unable to come in under traditional @entity12 , and only in certain markets in the country			1
@entity139 with respect to @entity139 , @entity2 ( and @entity3 ) would like to get the federal government far less involved			1
they want to convert the current program , where benefits are set at the federal level , and costs are shared between the federal and state governments , to one in which states are given far more flexibility to set benefits , and a block grant payment with which to pay for them			1
some states like this plan , because it will allow them to alter benefits and coverage locally so they will be on the hook for less money in the future			2
even though the federal government covers somewhere between 50 % and 75 % of @entity139 costs right now , the remaining spending is still a significant drain on state budgets			2
unfortunately , savings to the federal government would come from drastically cutting the amount of money they will give states in the future			0
the only way states would be able to provide insurance to @entity139 recipients on way less money would be if they reduced the benefits or the number of beneficiaries			1
if benefits are n't cut , and already low provider reimbursements are n't further reduced , then by 2021 about 19 million people , or one - third of all people on @entity139 , will need to be dropped from coverage			2
many of those covered by @entity139 are very poor elderly people , or those who are blind or disabled			1
if states acted to preferentially protect those groups from cuts , then 27 million other people , many of them children and pregnant women , would be dropped from @entity139			1
although it will likely get far less media attention , the changes to @entity139 may be far more radical			2
@entity139 is already one of the cheapest forms of insurance around			2
there is n't that much fat to be trimmed , regardless of how much states might " innovate			0
" although the focus of much of the election will be on @entity12 , these proposed changes to @entity139 are far more severe , and will have far more immediate repercussions			1
the choice the @entity10 administration would like to reduce future health care spending by a number of means , including @entity215 , the @entity216 and other programs that focus on providers and hospitals to save money ( discussed on @entity0 here )			1
they believe , in general , that relying on experts and leaning on providers can bend the cost curve			0
the problem is that some see this as rationing			0
@entity2 and @entity3 , on the other hand , believe that individuals should be the lever by which spending is reduced			2
they propose to decrease the amount the federal government pays for care by increasing the amount individuals pay and giving them more choices			2
they further believe that this will drive individuals to demand lower prices			0
with respect to @entity12 , the problem is that the amount seniors will be required to pay may be too much for many			1
moreover , there is little evidence that prices will drop ( they did n't for @entity130 ) , and this could result in some seniors forgoing necessary care , which will have negative health consequences			1
ironically , for all the talk about the concerns over the deficit , their plan also may not reduce @entity12 spending as much as the @entity122 does in the next decade			1
in a rational world , we 'd try all these things			0
a bipartisan plan could come from republicans accepting the @entity122 as it stands for all those younger than 65 , without further talk of repeal , in exchange for implementing the @entity266 plan for those 65 and older			0
after all , that proposal is n't really much different than the way the exchanges will work in the @entity122 , with the exception that there is a public option ( which should be opened to everyone under 65 as well )			0
everyone gets something they want , with all the tools available being brought to bear on containing future costs			0
this would require compromise , though , something that is in short supply in election years			0
join us on @entity285 / @entity284			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity288 .			0

@entity288 : @entity2 's proposals for @entity12 , @entity139 sharply differ from @entity10 's
he says @entity12 plan could change quality of care , increase cost to seniors
he says plan for block grants to states to pay for @entity139 would result in benefit cuts to poor , old
@entity288 : @entity10 's approach is different ; ideally a compromise would keep best of both plans
