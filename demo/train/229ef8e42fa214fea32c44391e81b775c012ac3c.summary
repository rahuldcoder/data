@entity0 -- a lawyer for @entity4 suspect @entity3 entered a plea of not guilty monday to all charges related to the 2012 attack on the @entity9 diplomatic complex in @entity10			1
but the federal judge in @entity0 delayed the setting of a trial date as prosecutors address concerns about classified material that will be involved in the case			0
the government 's attorney declined to say whether @entity3 will be the only defendant			1
@entity3 was brought to @entity20 in a motorcade under heavy security that included a police helicopter circling overhead and @entity9 marshals with @entity26 carbines patrolling the court perimeter			2
inside the courthouse , a bomb - sniffing dog explored the courtroom before the hearing began			0
@entity3 , a slender man with long gray hair and a shaggy gray beard , was led in by a team of four plainclothes security officers , three of whom stood directly behind him during the proceeding			2
he wore dark green overalls with " @entity39 " stenciled on the back , but he was not restrained by handcuffs or leg chains			0
an interpreter provided @entity3 with a narrative			1
@entity3 stood for his lawyer to enter his plea of not guilty but did not speak			2
during the short hearing , prosecutors said they needed more time to work with a variety of government agencies in obtaining classified materials that defense attorneys can use in the case			1
a defense attorney told the judge that prosecutors have been slow to produce even a bare minimum of documents that could allow her to make progress			1
" we have to start getting the basis on which he 's being charged , " said defense attorney @entity61 , complaining it 's been five months since @entity3 was first named			1
a federal grand jury handed up an 18 - count indictment october 14 that replaces a single count initially filed june 26			2
the indictment alleges he was the ringleader of the attack , leading 20 others to attack the diplomatic complex			0
among the charges was murder for the deaths of @entity9 ambassador to @entity10 @entity77 and three @entity9 security officers			1
@entity3 remained free for more than a year after the attacks , doing interviews with @entity1 and other media , prompting criticism of the @entity84 administration over how long it was taking to arrest the alleged attackers			2
he was arrested in a military raid in @entity10 in june and charged in federal court in @entity0 , mere yards away from @entity90 buildings where he has become the center of political controversy			1
@entity9 district judge @entity94 asked prosecutor @entity95 to characterize the state of document production required for the defense			0
he responded by saying there are " thousands of thousands of pages " and hundreds of hours of video , both consisting of a mix between classified and unclassified material			0
@entity95 said the government will request a closed hearing to discuss how to handle the classified material already in hand and anticipated from other government agencies			0
@entity61 told the judge it is misleading for prosecutors to list a large quantity that she has received so far , since she believes much of it is less meaningful than it could be			0
" they 're still redacting names that are publicly available , " she said , asserting that the defense should n't have to spend its time piecing together a puzzle of who said what			0
prosecutors did not directly answer the judge 's question as to when they will be ready to propose a trial date , and the defense counsel said her team needs more time to review the additional charges recently filed			1
@entity94 then continued the case to tuesday , december 9 at 10 a.m.			0
