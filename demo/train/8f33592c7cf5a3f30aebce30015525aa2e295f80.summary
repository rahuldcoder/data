-- " the stupidity is simply staggering , " rep. @entity0 , a moderate @entity1 from @entity2 , told @entity5			1
he was referring to the political miscalculation of anti-abortion forces in the @entity8 who insisted this week on reviving the culture wars , years behind us , still again , with yet another proposed abortion bill			1
this bill , championed by @entity15 @entity14 rep. @entity14 , sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks nationwide , with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest			1
" i 'll be very frank : i discouraged our leadership from bringing this to a vote on the floor , " @entity0 said			0
my e-mail box was flooded with headlines that began " this again ? " and " this ... is the @entity1 's idea of outreach to women ? really ? " and " he said what ? " the latter referred to a remark by @entity14 , chairman of the committee , that " incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low , " as a justification for the bill ignoring rape and incest victims			1
democrats on the @entity8 were apparently willing to allow the time when an abortion is legal to be reduced by one month			2
they sought to add exceptions for rape , incest and the woman 's health -- all of which were rejected by @entity1 on the panel			1
but it appears the @entity8 @entity1 leaders , recognizing a train wreck , added the language to the bill anyway to avoid an embarrassing defeat			1
the bill will also include an exception for a medical emergency in which the woman might die			2
this new altered version goes before the @entity68 on monday			0
there are , by the way , 22 republicans on the @entity8			1
it 's hard to avoid inflammatory remarks when discussing rape			2
and the line between inflammatory and insulting is thin			0
so if @entity14 thought he had to address the issue of rape , he should have done so judiciously			1
his remark says to women impregnated by rape : you do n't count			1
there are n't enough of you to matter			0
that 's not just insensitive ; it 's immoral			0
rep. @entity91 , @entity92 , first pounced on the statement 's factual inaccuracy			0
" i just find it astonishing to hear a phrase repeated that the incidence of pregnancy from rape is low , " she said			2
" there 's no scientific basis for that			0
" then @entity91 , one of five women among the @entity105 minority on the committee , added , " and the idea that the @entity1 men on this committee can tell the women of @entity111 that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous			1
" it might be that @entity14 ' argument , such as it is , echoed a comment by @entity117 @entity1 rep. @entity1 , who claimed during his @entity119 campaign last fall that women 's bodies have a built - in mechanism to prevent impregnation from " a legitimate rape			1
" @entity126 's candidacy went into a tailspin from that misinformed remark , and never recovered			0
fact checkers have pointed to studies that indicate @entity14 ' claim is as suspect as @entity1 's			1
one study by @entity133 found that pregnancies resulting from rape were higher than from other instances			2
@entity14 later walked back his low - pregnancy - from - rape argument , saying he was not claiming it was harder to get pregnant from rape			1
@entity14 apparently based his claim on there being fewer pregnancies from rape than from consensual intercourse			2
even so , that 's a " duh , do the math " excuse			0
@entity1 aides now say rep. @entity148 will be managing @entity14 ' anti-abortion bill			1
given her record -- " no " votes on major equality or women - protection legislation and " yea " for issues like ending federal funding for @entity157 -- that 's hardly an improvement			0
and it misses the point			0
it 's not the who , it 's the what -- the argument itself does not stand			0
during the @entity8 debate , @entity14 said , " when you make that exception , there 's usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours			1
and in this case that 's impossible			0
... and that 's what completely negates and vitiates the purpose for such an amendment			0
" so , @entity14 ' argument then became a technical one , that if a rape was n't reported , a decision after 20 weeks to abort was made too late			1
but why is it too late ? does psychological trauma have a timetable ? each case of rape that produces a pregnancy is as individual as the woman who was raped			2
and the ordeal -- psychological , emotional , physical , spiritual -- is not term - limited			0
the issue of abortion raises real and poignant moral questions			0
@entity14 made many remarks that show his obvious , deeply felt , conviction that abortions after 20 weeks are wrong			2
but majorities in @entity196 and of @entity111 , also with deep conviction , came to a different conclusion : they feel compelled to support exceptions for rape , incest and health			0
@entity204 ' outrageous comment and the viewpoints of other @entity1 on the @entity8 illustrate that when one party becomes so narrowly composed that it represents a particular religious culture , we 're headed to what people in other countries face when a ruling party begins making laws from religious theology , without regard to a democratic , secular society -- thus excluding other religious viewpoints and dismissing those who suffer as too few to matter			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

judiciary republicans sought anti-abortion bill with no exception for rape , incest
judiciary chair @entity14 : " incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low "
@entity220 : his remark tells women who got pregnant by rape they do n't count
@entity220 : @entity8 @entity1 finally added exception to the bill to avoid embarrassing defeat
