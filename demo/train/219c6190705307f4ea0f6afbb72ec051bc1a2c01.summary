@entity0 knew @entity2 in his youth , accompanying his artist mother from their home in the more affluent central @entity7 as she helped residents transform vacant lots with sculptures and murals			1
after growing up and working 10 years on photos examining economic divides in @entity14 , he knew where he wanted to look next			0
" @entity2 " is @entity0 's new 124 - page portrait of the people and properties in a struggling area where more than 40 % of residents in three local zip codes live below the poverty line			1
from crumbling buildings to abandoned lots long overgrown by nature , @entity0 says he examined neighborhoods long troubled by destitution yet ripe with beauty and possibility			1
" i want to show the complexity of the place			1
... it has a lot of hidden richness that maybe has been overlooked , " @entity0 said			1
for example ? start with the ubiquitous churches , some recently converted from commercial buildings			0
others , as he writes in the book 's essay , were " built in more prosperous times , such as the @entity40 , which played an important role in the @entity42			1
" " i was most drawn to those that were smaller and in flux , changing denominations and pastors frequently			0
they seemed more like local businesses vying to attract congregations , " he writes			0
he explored the area from 2008 to 2013 , mostly in the first two years when he lived on the edge of @entity2 upon his return from @entity14			1
a large - format camera -- hood over head , with a tripod -- was his tool of choice			0
" people thought i was a surveyor or real estate developer , " @entity0 said , and asked what he was up to			1
" but for the most part , when i told them what i was doing , they were quite open and welcoming -- happy that someone was taking interest in the neighborhood			0
" social media follow @ @entity74 on @entity75 to join the conversation about photography			0
@entity0 's choice of subjects reflected his personal experience in the area			1
@entity2 has both significant african - american and @entity84 populations , but @entity0 -- of @entity87 - @entity86 and @entity14 heritage -- focused on black residents and neighborhoods			1
it was in those neighborhoods that his mother , a @entity93 , started a renewal project that would transform vacant lots into a series of art parks			2
he helped in the summer and grew close to those he worked with			0
his mother 's roots also drew him to @entity14 in the late 1990s			2
wanting to explore his @entity102 heritage , he worked on a photo project examining people who migrated from the countryside to look for opportunity in cities like @entity108			0
it was a study in contradictions -- cities were newly prosperous , yet the workers remained poor , living on the margins			0
@entity0 returned to the @entity114 thinking he 'd explore economic divides there			1
that 's not exactly how it turned out , he says			2
he went to @entity118 and cities in @entity120 and elsewhere in the @entity121			0
once there , his interests were less about making a social point			0
" while i was interested in economic differences and racial divides , i felt there was something more personal for me in the project , " he said			0
" i realized i had some kind of a specific connection in @entity2			2
i was interested in looking at the place itself , not looking at it as a way to explore broader social issues			2
" it was a return to a place that grabbed his imagination years ago			2
" on one hand it is ignored and in decline , but it also is a place of tremendous possibility and great human resources -- people who are marginalized but also have a tremendous amount to offer , " he said			2
@entity0 is a photographer based in @entity148 , @entity149			1
you can follow him on @entity151 and @entity75			0
his new book , " @entity2 , " is available on @entity153 .			1
