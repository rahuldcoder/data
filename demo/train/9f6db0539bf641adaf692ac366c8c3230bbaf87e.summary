seldom have those words sounded quite so apt. they describe the people who enjoyed the singing of @entity7 , who died last week at the age of 104			1
the name may not be instantly recognizable to some @entity10 , but that was no fault of his			2
he accomplished something very few vocalists can claim : during his career , he sang in front of an estimated 200 million people in live performance			2
how could this be ? he was the lead vocalist at @entity20 's crusades and revival meetings for more than 50 years			1
if you went to see @entity20 preach , you heard @entity7 sing			1
and , oh , what a voice he had			2
it did n't matter what your own religious beliefs were			0
if you were interested in the craft -- the art -- of vocal performance , and you were in the presence of @entity7 ( that 's how he was known to his friends ) , then you recognized greatness			1
he was not fancy as he sang , he indulged in no gimmicks , at times he seemed as calm before a microphone as a man waiting patiently for a bus			0
his deep and immaculately modulated baritone , his resolute attention to precise phrasing and pronunciation , his implicit and unmistakable regard for his audience -- this was a professional artist of the highest order			2
the fact that he sang gospel music might , in theory , have worked against him , might have limited the number of his potential listeners ; for many of the years of his career , the nation was obsessed with rock ' n ' roll and other forms of popular , here - one - week , gone - the - next records			2
but he had a certain advantage : a singer 's audience is often influenced by the person who presents him or her			1
in the @entity67 ' early days , they had @entity70 television 's @entity68 to do that			0
it made a big difference			0
@entity7 , for half a century , had @entity20 to present him			1
at all those crusades , in all those stadiums and arenas , they were a matched pair			2
@entity20 would n't have had it any other way			1
they perfectly complemented each other 's strengths			0
@entity20 , at his peak , was utterly electric on a stage -- his presence was crackling and palpable , there was no structure in the world too big for him			1
in the charisma and magnetism department , he needed no help			0
but @entity7 was steady and soothing and reassuring			1
he was placid waters to @entity20 's blazing lightning			1
and for all those years , he was a considerable part of the draw			0
hear and see @entity7 sing at 1961 @entity20 crusade in 1971 , when i was getting started as a reporter , the @entity99 was scheduled to come to @entity103 's cavernous @entity102 for a week - and - a - half of summer services			1
i asked his advance team if i could spend days and nights with them , observing how they did what they did : how they made the arrangements and logistical decisions to get all those people to pack the huge hall every evening			2
they were welcoming and open about having me hang around			0
those were the years when the most successful and highly publicized musical acts were groups such as @entity118 and @entity119 and @entity120			0
so i was struck to find how constant , in my conversations with the people who were coming to the crusade meetings , their unprompted references to @entity7 were			1
he was a major and incandescent star to them -- they had been listening to him for years , and they could n't wait to see him perform in person			0
there was a phrase back then that was used in politics : the @entity134			0
in those times of turmoil and earsplitting acrimony in public life , the term referred to those @entity10 who did n't raise much commotion , but whose fidelity to tradition was unwavering			0
i thought then , and i think now , that the concept also applied to the enduring popularity of @entity7			1
he never tried to be stylish or trendy ; he did n't shift his approach as the decades went by			0
he just sang like a dream -- and , with his clear , careful enunciation and his dignified comportment on stage , he showed unwavering respect for the people in the seats			1
to watch and listen to @entity7 sing " @entity159 , " the gospel number most closely associated with him , was to be in the presence of an absolute master			1
( and if you 've ever heard @entity164 's haunting rendition of the same song , then you just know that @entity164 had to be a @entity7 fan , too			1
) he did fine for himself : more than 70 albums , a @entity168 , a separate @entity169 from the @entity168 organization			0
in the days when what is now called terrestrial radio -- that is , free radio , broadcast by local stations -- ruled , you could n't help hearing his voice as you twisted the dial through the stations in your town			0
he was a permanent cast member of @entity20 's " @entity180 , " which was syndicated to local stations all over the country , and the power of that voice would stop your hand , at least momentarily , from seeking something farther down the dial			2
on sunday his funeral will be held in @entity189 , @entity190 , his home for many years ; on monday he will be buried in a private ceremony on the grounds of the @entity193 in @entity194 , @entity190			0
i remember asking a member of the audience at that long - ago crusade in @entity103 what it was that made @entity7 's music so important to her			1
" when he sings , " she said , " he just brings me comfort			0
" which , in an often frenzied world , is not a bad sum - up of a long , serene and melodic life			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity7 , gospel singer at @entity20 crusades , died recently at 104
@entity213 : regardless of their faith , people knew greatness when they heard @entity7
@entity20 was electric on stage , @entity213 says . @entity7 was soothing and comforting
@entity213 : with clear enunciation , dignified presence , he showed respect for his audience
