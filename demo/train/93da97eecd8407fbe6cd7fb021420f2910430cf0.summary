-- the c - suite has long been thought of as a " boys ' club " ... and for good reason			2
in 2010 , only 15 of the companies on the @entity7 list were headed by women			1
additionally , nonprofit research firm @entity9 reported that overall , women held about 14.4 percent of the executive officer positions at @entity7 companies last year , and according to the @entity12 , women make up just 25.4 percent of chief executives nationwide			1
while these stats are certainly better than they were just 15 years ago -- in 1996 , only one @entity7 company had a female ceo -- there 's still plenty of room left for women in the c - suite			1
got your eye on an executive role ? here are some tips on how to get there , from female leaders with first - hand experience			1
find a mentor ( s ) : one of the best ways to become a great leader is by learning from others who do it well			2
" it is helpful for a woman seeking entry into c - suite positions to have an advocate in the organization , " says @entity34 , who was the first female partner at management consulting firm @entity35 and now serves as the ceo of the @entity37			1
" women need to have mentors and people who help them get the right roles and responsibilities			1
it 's important to have a team to help get to where you want to be			1
" equally as important is finding personal role models -- people whose experiences you can learn from , but who may not be formal mentors			2
" women must talk to people that they respect and role models who may be in the type of positions they seek			1
it 's critical to listen to how they developed their careers and how they became the leaders , " @entity34 says			1
do n't fixate on gender : while it can be tough to do , try to look at your work environment as being " gender neutral , " suggests @entity73 , managing director at @entity74			1
" there are certainly times when i have run into brick walls that have made me want to yell ' boys ' club ! ' but i have tried as much as possible to resist that temptation , " she says			2
" i have tried to look at each situation and think through what i could be doing better to demonstrate my capabilities and my credentials for each opportunity			2
i am not suggesting that there is no discrimination out there			0
but i find that the best way to break through prejudices and discrimination is to keep your focus , maintain your vision -- and just shine			0
" do n't worry about pleasing everyone : women tend to be " people pleasers , " which can be tough in a workplace setting when , inevitably , decisions need to be made that wo n't make everyone happy			1
but in order to reach the executive level in your career , you need to learn to stick to your guns			0
" women are too quick to apologize even when they did n't do anything wrong , " says @entity107 , vice president of public relations at @entity109 and co-author of " @entity111			1
" " stand behind your decisions			0
understand that not everyone is going to like you			0
if you can come to terms with that , you 'll be less apt to want to please everyone and more likely to fight for your beliefs , " she says			0
be willing to work hard : getting to the c - suite is an ambitious goal for anyone , male or female , so you 'll have to be willing to put in the work to get there			1
" the first rule is simply to get an @entity128 on everything you do , " @entity73 says			0
" [ as a manager ] , it is very rare that i will miss someone who is operating at that level on a consistent basis			0
and those are the people i am going to be looking for to fill higher level positions			0
" @entity138 , " the most important message i received was : you have to do the position you want before your get there			0
i hand to perform like a partner before i was promoted			0
" focus on your life outside of work , too : working hard does n't mean your personal life has to fall by the wayside			1
women are more apt to make life outside of work ( children , families , friends , hobbies ) a priority , and that 's ok			1
a rich personal life can actually make you a better leader			0
" women , in general , tend to look at life in a more holistic way , " @entity73 says			2
" i know is that my life is much richer for all the things i experience that have nothing to do with my corporate performance or positioning -- books and nature and art and family			0
in fact , i think that because i have chosen a more holistic path , i have gained the skills and the fullness i 've needed to become a better leader			0
" use your " natural " advantages : there are certain leadership qualities that women inherently possess , so play up these strong points in your rise to the top			1
" by nature , women are nurturing , and able to multitask and problem solve , " says @entity184 , managing director at @entity185 and co-author ( with @entity107 ) of " @entity187			2
" " those qualities can make for a very good leader			2
