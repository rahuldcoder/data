@entity0 -- in the first two days back from his @entity4 family vacation , president @entity2 gave two speeches on two important subjects			1
the first was a four - minute address from the @entity9 on monday on the economy			2
this was obviously a quickly thrown together speech to let the country know that even though the economic indicators , to quote the @entity15 , " trended from bad to worse " while the president golfed and relaxed , his team was aware of them			1
we all come back a little rusty , and hopefully relaxed , from our vacations , and certainly the president and his family are entitled to theirs			0
but this speech offered nothing new on the most important subject of concern to voters , who in two months may alter the political makeup of the @entity28 and change the way this president can do things for the remainder of his term			1
the president slammed the @entity35 one more time			0
this is his campaign theme , and obviously it is n't working			0
besides , the more he blames the @entity35 , the more difficult it will be to work with them in january , when they may have a majority or at least a lot more clout in the @entity28			0
saying his economic team was working on identifying new ways to boost the economy , the president said he would provide details " in the days and weeks to come			1
" it raises the obvious question : what has the administration been doing in the weeks and months just past ? it may not matter if the administration proposes any new measures on the economy , especially if they would require a vote in @entity28			0
i can promise you , mr. president , in the heat of a campaign battle royal -- in which your congressional team is on the brink of a disaster unlike any that @entity67 have faced since 1994 -- in the " days and weeks ahead , " they are going to be focused on doing nothing except trying to get re-elected and running as far from you and @entity71 speaker @entity70 as possible			1
the second speech was given from the newly decorated @entity73 on tuesday night in prime time			0
it was to celebrate the " @entity76 " : the withdrawal of combat troops from @entity79			1
i could n't quite figure out what the speech was about			2
our combat troops moved out of the cities of @entity79 last summer and have n't been in real combat since the success of the surge much earlier			1
there still is n't a functioning government there and may not be for months to come			0
mr. president , you need to fill in the blanks about what you meant when you said , " our combat mission is ending , but our commitment to @entity79 's future is not			1
" it was appropriate to thank our troops and military leadership			0
it was a nice gesture to tell the country that @entity104 supported our troops and loved our country , and obviously was committed to our national security			0
it would have even been more appropriate to say that the program he and secretary @entity111 laid out is the one the president implemented without change , and it seems to have worked			0
it would have been an accurate statement to remind people that we were withdrawing our troops because of a @entity118 signed in december 2008 by @entity104 and @entity79 president @entity119 to do so -- and not because @entity2 had promised this in his campaign			1
the @entity79 government insisted that we withdraw all of our forces by december 31 , 2011			2
we certainly will know by then whether the @entity79 government can stabilize and whether the @entity79 army and police can keep the peace			2
if not , the president has another tough decision to make			2
we signed an armistice in @entity131 in july 1953 -- and we still have nearly 30,000 troops there			0
let 's hope that 's not the outcome here			0
the president said : " now is the time to turn the page			0
" but , as in his speech on the economy , he raised several issues that will need to be clarified " in the days and weeks ahead			1
" he gave the clear impression that now that we are finished with the " bad war " in @entity79 , his term we can focus on the good war , @entity147			1
" because of the drawdown in @entity79 , we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense [ in @entity147 ]			2
" i am sure that the more than 100,000 troops fully engaged under the leadership of gen. @entity154 already think they are on the offense and did n't realize they were being bogged down by @entity79			1
but the president could n't leave it there			2
he had to return to politics , because every speech will be political between now and november 2			0
he went on to say : " as we wind down the war in @entity79 , we must tackle those challenges at home [ jobs , deficits , energy independence and education ] with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad			1
" the war was expensive , not only in terms of the soldiers who were killed and injured but in the trillion - plus dollars spent on it			0
but if the president thinks the nation and the world are in this economic mess because of a war he did n't want to fight and did n't support , we are in worst shape than i thought			1
we still have expensive obligations to those men and woman who so bravely served us			0
it 's not like we can close down the @entity190 and use that money to build more buildings to house @entity194 employees			0
now that @entity79 is fixed -- and in a few weeks we will hear how the president and his team plan to get the economy moving again -- we now move on to solving the crisis in the @entity199			1
lots of luck ! like most @entity202 , i want my president 's focus to be on the economy			1
in a few short weeks , we @entity202 get to exercise our voice and vote for a new @entity28			0
i promise our voice and our message will be a lot clearer than these two pedestrian speeches the president just made			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

president @entity2 made two speeches in first two days after vacation
@entity213 says the president 's speech on economy had no new ideas
@entity213 says speech on @entity79 left questions *unanswered*
he says it does n't make sense to blame our economic problems on the @entity79 war
