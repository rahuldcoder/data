@entity0 -- the @entity2 told the manufacturers of seven caffeinated alcoholic beverages wednesday that their drinks are a " public health concern " and ca n't stay on the market in their current form			1
the move follows a year - long review by the @entity2 , which gave the companies 15 days to either reformulate their products or face possible seizure under federal law , said dr. @entity15 , the agency 's principal deputy commissioner			1
experts have said the caffeine used in the beverages can mask the effects of alcohol , leaving drinkers unaware of how intoxicated they are			0
" @entity2 does not find support for the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is ' generally recognized as safe , ' which is the legal standard , " @entity15 told reporters			1
" to the contrary , there is evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern			1
" one of the companies that received warning letters was @entity40 , of @entity41 , @entity42 , which makes @entity40 -- a drink nicknamed " blackout in a can " by some users			1
the company announced tuesday that it was dropping caffeine and two other ingredients , guarana and taurine , from @entity40 in the face of " a difficult and politically - charged regulatory environment			1
" the other companies are @entity55 , @entity56 - based @entity57 , which manufactures the @entity59 and @entity60 brands ; @entity61 , @entity63 's @entity62 , which sells @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 ; and @entity67 of @entity68 , @entity69 , which makes @entity70			1
@entity15 called @entity40 's decision to drop caffeine and two other ingredients a " positive step " wednesday			1
and in a statement issued after the decision , the company said it was pleased by @entity2 's response			1
" as we stated yesterday , we have stopped the production and shipment of all our products containing these ingredients , " the company said			0
" we will continue to work closely and cooperatively with national and state regulators			0
" but @entity67 proprietor @entity85 told @entity1 she was puzzled by the @entity2 's decision to include @entity87 on its list			1
" i do n't know what to say except i 'm really shocked about the outcome of the @entity2 's inquiry , and i need more answers than what i 've gotten , " said @entity85 , who said she is @entity67 's only full - time employee			2
@entity85 described @entity87 as a craft beer that has about 4 percent alcohol by weight , about two - thirds the caffeine of a cup of coffee and is sold in only three cities -- " and yet it 's being singled out with @entity40 and @entity59			1
" " those brands are neon green			0
they 're not beer , they 're juice , with 200 grams of sodium and artificial everything , " she said			0
@entity57 said tuesday that it would review any new @entity2 guidelines , but noted it was unaware " of a single incident of injury or other harm associated with its products			2
" neither @entity57 nor @entity62 had responded to requests for comment after the announcement			0
the @entity2 has no authority to ban the products outright			2
but @entity15 said the review is still going on , and " we expect these warning letters to be read across the industry			0
" " this will send a message to the industry about the importance of looking directly at these alcoholic beverages and how the @entity2 will respond to that , " he said			2
the @entity2 began its review in november 2009 , after complaints from officials in several states			2
the controversy exploded in october , when nine underage students at @entity135 were hospitalized after drinking @entity40 , both on its own and mixed with other drinks , police reported			2
critics say drinks like @entity40 mix caffeine equal to the amount in three cups of coffee with the alcoholic equivalent of three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high - caffeine energy drinks			1
a 23.5 - ounce can of @entity40 contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume , depending on state regulations			2
@entity40 has compared @entity40 to popular drinks like rum and cola or @entity158 coffee that also mix caffeine and alcohol			1
but " we did n't see these kinds of events when people were drinking irish coffees , " @entity161 , @entity0 's state attorney general , told reporters			0
" what we 're seeing now is striking , and we need to take quick action , " @entity168 said			0
@entity0 and four other states -- @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 -- already have taken steps to remove @entity40 and similar drinks from store shelves			1
and @entity179 , the @entity181 anti-drug czar , praised the @entity2 for moving against products he said are " designed , branded , and promoted to encourage binge drinking			0
" " acting early to protect public health is critical and a vital component of the @entity188 administration 's effort to reduce drug use and its consequences , " he said			1
combining large amounts of caffeine and alcohol produces " a wide - awake drunk , " said dr. @entity195 , an associate professor of emergency medicine at @entity198 's medical school in @entity199			0
but since caffeine 's effect wears off faster than alcohol 's , she said , drinkers are left with " much more alcohol than he would have been able to tolerate -- and that leads to blackouts			0
" " if you 're going to drink caffeine , drink it responsibly			0
if you 're going to drink alcohol , drink it responsibly , " said @entity195 , who has studied the drinks extensively			0
" but mixing them is dangerous , because you might not know when you 've had too much to drink			0
" @entity1 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
